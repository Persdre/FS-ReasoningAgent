        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA quarter of all Ethereum (ETH) in supply is now being staked, data shows. According to figures from blockchain data firm Nansen, over 30 million ETH\u2014or about $74 billion worth of the cryptocurrency\u2014has been locked up.\n\nStaking is the process of \u201clocking up\u201d digital coins or tokens to help keep a blockchain network running. Proof-of-stake assets like ETH require users to pledge their coins to the network by sending it to a specific blockchain address. Those who stake earn token rewards in the process.\n\nLast year, the Ethereum network was upgraded, allowing users to easily withdraw staked ETH. Since then, liquid staking protocols have boomed\u2014allowing users to seamlessly lock up and withdraw their crypto.\n\nAs ETH enthusiasts eagerly await the approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that brings the second-largest digital asset to Wall Street, applicants are talking about staking in their proposals. Yesterday, investment firm Ark 21Shares amended their spot ETH ETF S-1 to mention the practice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the trust\u2019s assets through one or more trusted staking providers,\u201d the filing read.\n\nStaking is controversial with regulators, though: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has fined major crypto companies\u2014such as digital asset exchanges Kraken and Coinbase\u2014for allegedly selling unregistered securities via staking services.\n\nThe Ethereum network is in the process of an upgrade, too. Developers this week finalized the Dencun upgrade on a testnet. It is now expected to go live on the mainnet by March 13.\n\nDevelopers claim that Dencun will solve the scalability problem of the network behind the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency\u2014which is slow and expensive\u2014so that it will potentially be able to process over 100,000 transactions per second in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Dencun will introduce a technical feature called \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d and stands as the most substantial update to Ethereum since the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade last April that allowed people to withdraw their previously locked staked ether for the first time.\n\nRead More: Battle of the Blocks: PoW vs. PoS\n\nA hard fork for the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Dencun, if adopted by the majority of node operators, will irreversibly change the underlying code of Ethereum. The name Dencun combines \u201cDeneb,\u201d the name of a star in the Cygnus constellation, with \u201cCancun,\u201d where Devcon 3 took place.\n\nOne of the most widely-discussed changes is the upgrade\u2019s \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d feature which introduces a new type of transaction involving \u201cblobs,\u201d a memory space for storing transaction data. The advent of blob-carrying transactions is expected to reduce the cost of transacting for layer 2 rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nRead More: What Is Proto-Danksharding?\n\nSoftware developers decided on the date on Thursday morning at their biweekly Zoom meeting focused on coordinating changes to the blockchain\u2019s consensus layer, the component of Ethereum dedicated to establishing agreement among network participants over the state of the network.\n\nThe announcement comes one day after Ethereum developers successfully triggered the upgrade on a test network named \u201cHole\u0161ky.\u201d Test networks are instances of blockchains where developers and users can experiment with changes to the functionalities of the network without affecting the real, live network.\n\nThe price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has increased 2% in the past 24 hours to $2,435 at the time of publication, data from CoinGecko shows."
