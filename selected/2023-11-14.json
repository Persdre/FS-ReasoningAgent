        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been holding above the $2,000 mark as investment products significantly surged after the exchange-traded fund proposal.\n\nThe largest asset manager with $9.4 trillion of assets under management, BlackRock, registered an iShares ETH Trust on Nov. 9. Since the proposal, Ethereum saw a 9% rise, surpassing the crucial $2,000 mark.\n\nETH price, whale activity, open interest and Binance funding rate \u2013 Nov. 14 | Source: Santiment\n\nAccording to data provided by Santiment, following the rise, whale transactions consisting of at least $100,000 worth of ETH surged by 25% over the past 24 hours \u2014 hiking from 2,151 to 2,678 transactions over the past day.\n\nYou might also like: NFT market revives as major collections soar in sales and volume\n\nAccording to a crypto.news report on Nov. 13, whales have accumulated over $58 million worth of Aave (AAVE), Ethereum, Arbitrum (ARB), Pepe (PEPE), and a few more altcoins over the past week.\n\nWith the hike in whale activity, data provided by Santiment shows that ETH\u2019s price-daily active addresses (DAA) divergence took a deep dive, declining to negative 45.17%. When the price DAA divergence drops to below zero, the indicator suggests a \u201csell\u201d signal since large whales might manipulate the market.\n\nOn the other hand, per Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s total open interest (OI) declined from $4.15 billion on Nov. 10 to $3.85 billion at the time of writing.\n\nMoreover, ETH\u2019s Binance funding rate currently stands at 0.02%, suggesting the dominance of short position holders until further movements.\n\nEthereum is up by 0.7% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $2,050 when writing. The asset\u2019s market cap rose to $247.5 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $13.4 billion."

        "title": "Ethereum and Solana lead DeFi surge as TVL and DEX activity soar - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The DeFi sector has experienced a significant increase in both activity and token prices, primarily driven by Bitcoin\u2019s October rally. Central to understanding this landscape is the concept of Total Value Locked (TVL) and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, two critical metrics that offer insights into the health and trajectory of DeFi protocols.\n\nTVL, the aggregate value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols, serves as a barometer for sector health and investor sentiment. CryptoSlate analysis found an interesting growth pattern across various chains. Ethereum, the frontrunner with $25.336 billion in TVL, has seen a 31.14% increase over the past month, cementing its dominant position in the DeFi space. Solana, though lower in overall TVL, showed the highest growth rate at 89.31%. Notably, all chains recorded positive growth over the month, indicating a robust expansion across the sector.\n\nThe number of active users on these chains offers additional insights. Despite its lower TVL, Tron boasts a significantly larger active user base of 1.69 million, which could result from a more retail-oriented user landscape. Conversely, Ethereum\u2019s lower active user count than its TVL might indicate a higher engagement of institutional or sophisticated, high-net-worth investors.\n\nThe market cap to TVL ratio is another critical metric, shedding light on the market\u2019s perception of a chain\u2019s value. Ethereum\u2019s ratio of 9.72 suggests a mature market. In contrast, Solana\u2019s higher ratio of 43.49 indicates either potential growth opportunities or an undervalued ecosystem, warranting closer investor scrutiny.\n\nName Protocols Active Users 1D Change 7D Change 1M Change TVL Stablecoins 24h Volume 24h Fees Market Cap to TVL ratio 1.Ethereum 946 304,493 -0.12% +6.50% +31.14% $25.473b $64.929b $1.718b $7.27m 9.63 2.Tron 26 1.69m -1.34% +5.04% +25.14% $8.291b $47.455b $11.33m $1.66m 1.13 3.

The rapid growth in DEX volumes on platforms like Solana and Polygon, with increases of 81.35% and 86.32%, respectively, reflects growing user adoption and confidence.\n\nName Weekly change Volume (24h) Volume (7d) TVL % of total Cumulative volume 1.

Ethereum continues to lead, both in terms of TVL and DEX volume, signaling strong investor confidence and market dominance.\n\nHowever, the rapid growth of newer platforms like Solana and Polygon suggests a diversifying landscape, with different chains catering to varied user needs and investment profiles. The market cap to TVL ratios further confirms the growth potential of lower market cap chains, with Solana and Polygon positioning themselves for future growth.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Underperforming the Market? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A number of factors are holding back Ethereum's market performance, including the reemergence of Bitcoin.\n\nAt first glance, Ethereum (ETH 1.79%), the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency, seems to be having a banner year. Ethereum is up 57% and appears to be gaining momentum heading into the final weeks of the year. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum is up more than 20%.\n\nBut context matters, and right now, Ethereum is badly underperforming the crypto market. Bitcoin (BTC 2.86%), for example, is up a spectacular 112% this year. And other top cryptocurrencies are similarly posting triple-digit gains in 2023. All of this has complicated the decision-making calculus around Ethereum, which now looks like a market laggard. If you are thinking about buying Ethereum, this is what you need to know.\n\nWhy is Ethereum underperforming?\n\nWhat's particularly puzzling about Ethereum this year is that it's just so hard to pinpoint exactly why it's underperforming Bitcoin and other top cryptos. Heading into 2023, Ethereum seemed to be riding a wave of momentum after pulling off The Merge, which was widely hailed as one of the greatest technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. As a result of The Merge, Ethereum changed its overall blockchain infrastructure, all with the goal of reducing transaction fees, boosting transaction processing speeds, and improving overall efficiency.\n\nBut a number of issues have popped up throughout this year. For one, overall activity on the Ethereum blockchain seems to be down and that's not a good sign for future growth. Case in point: Bitcoin recently passed Ethereum for the first time ever in terms of 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume, an area Ethereum has always dominated. And Total Value Locked (TVL), which measures activity on the blockchain, also recently reached a 12-month low, a potential sign of Ethereum's weakening position in decentralized finance. These might just be short-term blips on the radar, but they are still concerning.\n\nThere have been regulatory concerns, too, such as those related to staking activity on Ethereum's brand-new proof-of-stake blockchain. The primary concern is that the SEC's willingness to go after major cryptocurrency exchanges for their staking activity, as we saw earlier this year, will eventually erode the attractiveness of Ethereum as an investment option.\n\nMoreover, The Merge is not having the sort of breakthrough impact it was supposed to have, as measured by transaction fees and transaction processing speeds. For example, transaction fees for relatively straightforward activities, such as buying a new NFT, can sometimes run into the hundreds of dollars. And the main Ethereum blockchain can still only handle 20 to 30 transactions per second, a far cry from the 1 million transactions per second promised years ago.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nPerhaps the best explanation, though, might be that investors are almost single-mindedly focused on Bitcoin at the moment. Just about everyone seems to be looking ahead to the imminent launch of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), and what that could mean for the broader crypto market. Ethereum almost feels like an afterthought right now.\n\nPerhaps as a result, the longtime strong correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin appears to be weakening. Until mid-March, the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum was nearly 0.95. That's almost a perfect 1-to-1 match in terms of performance. But now the 90-day correlation between the two has dipped to the 0.8 level.\n\nEthereum vs. other altcoins\n\nIn addition, many other cryptos appear to be passing Ethereum right now. That's of particular concern in the case of Solana (SOL 4.65%), which is arguably Ethereum's greatest rival right now in the Layer-1 blockchain space. Solana is up a stunning 325% year to date. While Solana has its own fair share of regulatory and technical issues, investors have largely been willing to shrug them off due to Solana's perceived growth prospects. Solana's new \"crypto phone\" is just one of the most exciting projects.\n\nThese shifting investor perceptions of Ethereum are having an impact on institutional money flows. Quite simply, large institutional investors appear to be taking their money out of Ethereum and moving it into Solana. In 28 of 32 weeks this year, Solana has seen net positive inflows, according to CoinShares, which tracks inflows and outflows into different cryptocurrencies. In contrast, Ethereum has seen outflows. And that has led to CoinShares calling Solana \"the altcoin of choice\" for institutional investors right now.\n\nCan Ethereum bounce back?\n\nAt the end of the day, the decision whether or not to invest in Ethereum comes down to your view of its long-term growth prospects. Ethereum is still the clear leader in just about every niche or sector of the blockchain world and it's one of the few cryptos that seems to have the implicit support of federal regulators. Notably, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has always stopped short of calling Ethereum a \"security.\" And it's not like analysts have completely given up on Ethereum. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, just put out an aggressive $8,000 price target for Ethereum.\n\nGoing forward, I'm keeping a close eye on how Ethereum fends off the threat from rival Solana. This one factor could end up having the greatest impact on Ethereum's long-term growth prospects. If Ethereum is unable to keep up with Solana and other Layer-1 blockchains, that could have a huge impact on my decision of whether or not to invest in Ethereum going forward."
