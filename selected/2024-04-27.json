        "content": "The listing represents a preliminary step in the trading process, yet it does not ensure that the SEC will grant approval for the fund.\n\nShare this article\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF has appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation\u2019s (DTCC) new securities list with the ticker EZET. This development occurred just a day following reports of the SEC\u2019s probable rejection of spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe DTCC listing represents a preliminary step in the trading process, yet it does not ensure that the SEC will approve the Ether Spot ETF. The SEC\u2019s decision on the fund remains pending.\n\nFranklin Templeton filed for spot Ethereum ETF in February, joining other industry giants like BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK Invest, in the race. However, the outlook for Ethereum-based funds is not as promising as it was for Bitcoin-based predecessors.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates there is only a 25% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. He cites a noticeable absence of engagement from the SEC, contrasting with the Bitcoin ETF approval process. Balchunas interprets this silence as a deliberate \u2018tactical\u2019 decision rather than mere \u2018procrastination.\u2019\n\nJPMorgan analysts anticipate a protracted delay in the regulatory approval of the spot Ethereum ETF, though they suggest that approval could eventually follow a legal challenge similar to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit, which compelled the SEC to reassess spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s market performance has stagnated post-Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving, with its price staying between $3,100 and $3,200, according to CoinGecko. At press time, Ethereum is trading at around $3,100, down 1% in 24 hours."

The website lists the ETF and indicates that it is available for creation and redemption. The DTCC listing however does not imply an approval of the S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange. Franklin Templeton submitted its Spot ETH ETF application on February 12.\n\nEthereum ETF appears on DTCC website\n\nWhile not directly related to the S-1 filing, listing on the DTCC is a crucial step that allows for supply adjustment of ETF shares to help keep up with their demand in the market.

        "content": "Selling pressure on Ethereum rose over the past week\n\nMost market indicators looked bearish on ETH\u2019s charts\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price managed to climb past $3.2k last week. Soon after, however, the altcoin turned bearish as ETH was unable to hold its position on the charts. Given how everything has panned out, if the worst scenario is to be considered here, ETH might fall to its $2.7k support level.\n\nMore red for Ethereum\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price appreciated by 2% last week, allowing it to go past $3.2k on 24 April. However, the uptrend didn\u2019t last long as its price dropped over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,118.13 with a market capitalization of over $380 billion.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, 79% of Ethereum investors are still in profit. The decline in ETH\u2019s price also affected its social volume negatively. Additionally, after a spike on 25 April, its weighted sentiment dropped on the charts. This alluded to bearish sentiment around ETH being on the higher side.\n\nThings can get worse, however, as if ETH records more price corrections, its value might drop to the $2.7k support level in the coming days, as per a recent tweet from Crypto Tony, a popular crypto analyst. The possibility of ETH hitting that support level would increase if it fails to go above $3.6k.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto took a look at Santiment\u2019s data to see whether metrics seemed bearish.\n\nWe found that selling pressure on the token has been increasing. This was evidenced by the hike in its exchange inflows over the past week. The fact that selling pressure was high was further proven by ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges, which rise.\n\nOn the contrary however, whales remain confident in ETH as its supply held by top addresses went up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s immediate support levels\n\nAMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s daily chart to find whether a sustained downtrend is inevitable or not. We found that the Money Flow Index (MFI) went north \u2013 A sign predicting a price uptick.\n\nNonetheless, the rest of the indicators seemed bearish. For instance, both ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) headed south, meaning that the chances of a further price drop were high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nFinally, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital\u2019s data revealed that ETH has a strong support level near $3.1k if a price correction happens.\n\nA drop below that level could result in ETH plummeting to $2.8k before it reaches its tested support level at $2.7k in the coming days or weeks."

        "content": "Though dev activity dropped, Polkadot\u2019s network activity hiked on the charts\n\nA trend reversal could be on the cards for DOT\u2019s price action\n\nPolkadot [DOT] has been renowned for having robust development activity consistently over the years. However, as per recent data, other blockchains like Ethereum [ETH] and BNB Chain have emerged to overtake its levels over the last few days. While this shift happened, DOT\u2019s price action turned bearish on the charts.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s development activity drops\n\nCoin98 Analytics recently shared a tweet mentioning a list of blockchains ranked in terms of their development activity. As per the tweet, Polkadot registered 827 developers last week, with the blockchain witnessing over 5000 weekly code commits.\n\nThough the number by itself wasn\u2019t low, it was lower than other blockchains. For instance, ETH had more than 2000 weekly developers who executed over 19,000 commits. Polkadot was also behind BNB Chain, whose weekly commits exceeded 6,000.\n\nOther blockchains that outshined DOT were Polygon [MATIC] and Optimism [OP], whose weekly commits stood at 6,300 and 5,200, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data also revealed a similar story. We found that DOT\u2019s development activity dropped sharply over the last seven days. However, despite the drop in dev activity, the blockchain\u2019s dev activity contributor count spiked multiple times last week.\n\nHere, it is interesting to note that while the blockchain\u2019s dev activity fell, its network activity registered a massive spike last week.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Artemis\u2019 data revealed that after several days of dormancy, DOT\u2019s daily active addresses shot up considerably on 24 April. Thanks to the rise in active addresses, its daily transaction count also followed a similar trend.\n\nBears are attacking DOT\n\nIn the meantime, Polkadot bears buckled up as the token\u2019s price dipped on the charts. According to CoinMarketCap, DOT lost more than 1.5% of its value in the last seven days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s value dipped by 2%. At press time, DOT was trading at $6.70 with a market capitalization of over $9.6 billion.\n\nDOT\u2019s funding rate has risen over the last few days too. This is a bearish development as prices tend to move in the opposite direction from the funding rate.\n\nNonetheless, Polkadot\u2019s open interest also went down. A decline in the metric is a sign that chances of the ongoing market trend changing are high.\n\nRead Polkadot\u2019s [DOT] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nDOT\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick and was heading further above the neutral level, suggesting a possible price hike.\n\nFinally, as per the Bollinger Bands, DOT\u2019s price was resting under its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A successful breakout above that level could result in a fresh bull run for the altcoin on the charts."

Santiment reported that Bitcoin active wallets are rising quickly despite choppy prices.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Fall Raises Questions\n\nPost-Bitcoin halving performance of Bitcoin (ETH) and Ethereum (ETH) prices raised questions of whether the market has lost faith or is this just a short pause in a longer-term bull run.\n\nQCP Capital, a Singapore-based digital asset trading company, in a new trade idea on April 27 noted the volumes in Bitcoin and Ethereum options have compressed drastically. This week, heavy selling of BTC options has seen the vol curve collapse, with Bitcoin vols further compressing from 70% to 50%. The company added that if people are looking to buy BTC and ETH, then this consolidating market is the best time to accumulate longs.\n\nOther the other side, the downside skew in Ethereum (ETH) risk reversals has also dropped further to -13%, said QCP Capital. This could be due to recent reports of SEC possibly denying or further delaying spot Ether ETF. According to people familiar with the matter, the SEC and its staff have shown no interest in the spot Ether ETF and its potential.
