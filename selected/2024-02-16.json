        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana All Jumped Double-Digits This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin jumped again this week as investors flooded into the crypto industry.\n\nThe crypto market came to life this week as Bitcoin (BTC -0.33%) passed $52,000 and the $1 trillion market cap level. As of noon ET on Friday, Bitcoin is up 10.2% over the past seven days and is holding strong.\n\nBitcoin isn't the only winner in crypto. Ethereum (ETH -0.67%) is up 12.2% to $2,784 per token and high-throughput blockchain Solana (SOL -0.19%) is up 4.7%, although it was up over 10% for the week just a few hours ago.\n\nWhat's driving the crypto market\n\nThe simple driver of crypto right now is the flow of funds into the industry. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen hundreds of millions of dollars of inflows this week alone and now holds over 100,000 Bitcoins. That's enough to inflate the entire market.\n\nBitcoin's rise is particularly interesting given competing forces in the market. A strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates have typically correlated to Bitcoin declining, but that trend is being offset by tech and growth stocks rising, which Bitcoin is directly correlated with.\n\nTraders have speculated that Bitcoin has become a safe haven for international investors or there's an increased pool of buyers because of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but the reality is money is coming into Bitcoin at a much faster pace than it's going out and that's driving the price.\n\nEthereum and Solana keep up\n\nEthereum is up in part because traders are expecting it to be the next crypto ETF. That would be the natural next step, although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn't said it will allow any ETFs beyond Bitcoin's.\n\nSolana could be another ETF candidate, but it's up in part because of airdrops in the ecosystem that has brought more liquidity and value, some of which is flowing back to the Solana token.\n\nIt's not unusual for tokens like Ethereum and Solana to climb alongside Bitcoin and that's at least one of the drivers of the tokens this week.\n\nWhat's ahead for crypto?\n\nOutside of just token values rising, Coinbase Global's earnings release this week showed optimism about crypto exchanges and also crypto use cases. Coinbase is seeing more adoption among institutions and developers and is also pushing for regulatory clarity about what's a security and what isn't in crypto.\n\nAs the industry leader in the U.S., Coinbase's position and activism are very important to the crypto industry and when it's reporting healthy financial results that bodes well for the industry.\n\nI think all of these factors working together are very bullish for cryptocurrencies in general and even exchanges and development companies like Coinbase. But it'll be a bumpy ride and the gains earned this week could evaporate next week. So, prepare for the volatility ahead -- any dips could be a buying opportunity for investors."

        "content": "The cost to attack Bitcoin ranges from $5 billion to $20 billion, while it would cost over $34 billion to attack Ethereum, according to CoinMetrics. Even then, researchers found no way for the attacker to profit and the network would still survive.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could now be resilient to 51% attacks,\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could now be resilient to 51% attacks, according to new research from on-chain analytics firm CoinMetrics.\n\nA 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners or malicious actors that control more than half the network\u2019s mining hash rate in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) environment or nodes in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) setting, putting them in control over the network.\n\nOf course, the bigger the network is, the harder it becomes to control the majority of hashing power, and now it appears it might be too difficult to execute an attack on the two largest blockchains \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nResearchers quantified the Total Cost to Attack (TCA) of these blockchains and found that it\u2019s more expensive to carry out a malicious act like this than to participate in the network honestly.\n\nLucas Nuzzi, CoinMetrics\u2019 head of research and development, shared excerpts from the academic paper\u2019s findings on X. By the researchers\u2019 estimates, in order to attack Bitcoin, someone would have to buy 7 million ASIC miners \u2013 the cost of which would likely be higher than $20 billion, based on how the market would react to a relentless buyer.\n\n4/ But these ASICs are not for sale! How do you buy 51% of them? One way to do that is to simulate using historical ASIC market data (thanks to https://t.co/C4YC0XjzxI) to see how that market would react to a relentless ASIC buyer In one scenario, that cost alone is close to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fnS6DrLSY8 \u2014 Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) February 15, 2024\n\nEven if a nation-state attacker had the financial resources to manufacture their own ASICs for the attack, the only model that could be reverse engineered would be the Bitmain AntMiner S9, which also has a manufacturing cost of over $20 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the researchers estimate that the total cost to attack Ethereum would be more than $34 billion, with an ETH price of $2,279 (the current price of ETH is $2,830), the total amount of ETH staked at 28.8 million, and a validator count of 899,840. This would also take more than six months due to the churn limit preventing stake from being deployed all at once\n\nOne major concern that industry watchers have raised over the years is the potential threat from Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) provided by staking services like Lido and RocketPool. Lido, in particular, controls 31% of staked ETH, close to Ethereum\u2019s economic security threshold of 33%, meaning that network finality could be disrupted if these nodes colluded.\n\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, an attacker could not leverage LSDs to buy access to block templates,\u201d said Nuzzi.\n\n9 We also find no ways for a nation-state attacker to continuously run a 51% / 34% attack if the goal is to destroy these networks. The possibility of retaliation techniques makes ideologically driven attacks costly at each retaliation round. In the end, the network survives. \u2014 Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) February 15, 2024\n\nUpdated on Feb. 16, 2024, at 6:34 am EST: A previous version of the article misstated the cost to attack Ethereum as $34 million rather than $34 billion. Unchained regrets the error.\n\nUpdated on Feb. 16, 2024, at 7:30 am EST: Change the title from \u201c51% Attacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum Impossible: CoinMetrics\u201d to \u201cAttacking Ethereum Costs More Than an Attack on Bitcoin: CoinMetrics\u201d"
