        "title": "Ethereum: Here\u2019s How to Be a Millionaire When ETH Hits $3,000 - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has surged by over 87% since the beginning of the year. Although the growth is commendable, ETH\u2019s rise in 2023 is overshadowed by Solana\u2019s (SOL) over 500% growth and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) over 150% growth in the same time frame. Nonetheless, analysts anticipate the asset to rally to new highs in the next bull run.\n\nETH is currently up 3% in the daily charts and 0.9% in the last week. Moreover, the token\u2019s price has surged by over 14% over the previous month.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: What Are Institutional Investors Buying?\n\nDespite the healthy rise in 2023, ETH is still down by over 50% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, which it attained on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nHow to be a millionaire when Ethereum (ETH) hits $3000?\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nReaching $3000 from current levels amounts to a growth of about 33%. To have a million dollars worth of Ethereum at $3000, you would need around 333.33 ETH tokens. The cost of 333.33 ETH at current prices is about $747,333.\n\nHowever, if ETH reaches its all-time high of $4878.26, the same investment would be worth around $1,626,000 ($1.62 million).\n\nNow, the question is whether Ethereum (ETH) will reach its all-time high again or not. The short answer is yes. There is a high chance of ETH not only hitting but surpassing its previous all-time peak.\n\nAlso Read: JP Morgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nAccording to Changelly, Ethereum (ETH) could surpass its all-time high by 2025. According to the platform, ETH could hit a maximum price of $5,930.32 in 2025.\n\nHowever, if the crypto markets enter a bull run in 2024, fueled by a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), Ethereum could hit a new all-time high much sooner, making some holders millionaires. All significant cryptocurrencies may hit new peaks if the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) approves one or more spot BTC ETF applications."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYou get an airdrop! You get an airdrop!\n\nAmid hopes and prayers for the crypto bull market\u2019s imminent return, the onslaught of \u201cfree money\u201d airdrops for crypto users continues. The latest comes courtesy of Frame, an Ethereum scaling network designed for NFTs.\n\nThe project announced Tuesday that it will soon launch a native FRAME token, and that any crypto user who has transacted an NFT on Ethereum in the last two years is now eligible to collect varying amounts of FRAME. Criteria used to determine a user\u2019s airdrop size is determined based on the number of NFT trades made, the financial volume of those trades, and the amount of creator royalties paid during those transactions.\n\nWhile NFT traders can already claim FRAME via an online portal, those tokens won\u2019t functionally exist until January 31, when they will go live alongside the Frame mainnet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$FRAME, for the immediate future, will be used for governance on the network. This is especially important when you consider the value that the Frame Creator Fund will come to hold. The token will be transfer-locked until a later chapter. pic.twitter.com/4nZggIKqg3 \u2014 Frame (@frame_xyz) December 19, 2023\n\nFRAME tokens will initially be used exclusively for governance of the Frame ecosystem, the project announced, and to control the Frame Creator Fund. At a later, as-yet-unannounced date, the tokens will be unlocked for transfer and presumably become tradable on secondary markets for monetary value.\n\nUsers already began claiming their free FRAME Tuesday. Some reported receiving thousands of tokens, based on their NFT trading activity.\n\nI survived the bear market and claimed my $FRAME tokens!@frame_xyz is the Layer 2 for creators and collectors. If you've traded NFTs on Ethereum and paid royalties in the past two years you're eligible! \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\ud83c\udf84 You can check here \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/95XO3A357v pic.twitter.com/lISxo38lmn \u2014 Pranksy \ud83d\udce6 (@pranksy) December 19, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday\u2019s airdrop is only the first of many FRAME giveaways, the project said. Once the project fully launches at the end of next month, it will begin distributing more tokens to users and community members to encourage activity.\n\nFrame seeks to create an ecosystem for the buying, selling, and creation of NFTs that unambiguously puts creators first. The layer-2 rollup is based on Arbitrum Nova, an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nSince last year, the practice of enforcing creator royalties\u2014fees generally between 2.5% and 10% levied on NFT buyers, meant to support artists and enshrine blockchain\u2019s democratized ethos\u2014has been steadily dismantled under the weight of brutal market forces.\n\nFrame enforces creator fees at the network level; it says it also prioritizes NFT security more than other blockchains, and will eventually be run by community members.\n\nIn tandem with its airdrop announcement, Frame also announced that it has secured an initial fundraise led by Electric Capital, with participation from several crypto industry founders and influencers, including Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz. A Frame advisor told Decrypt that the project isn\u2019t yet disclosing the funding amount or total amount of FRAME tokens.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Lisk embraces Ethereum: a new era for blockchain interoperability. - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Lisk blockchain, at the forefront of the Web3 ecosystem, has recently announced an epochal transition to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution.\n\nWith the support of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack and Gelato\u2019s advanced infrastructure, Lisk is poised to play a crucial role in bringing Optimism Superchain\u2019s vision to life. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe strategic transition of the Lisk blockchain to Ethereum as a layer-2 solution\n\nAs anticipated, Gelato has officially announced the expansion of its versatile all-in-one platform, known as Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS).\n\nThis growth includes support not only for Polygon CDK, but also for OP Stack, the open-source modular development framework developed by Optimism Collective.\n\nIn this expansion phase, Gelato has opened its doors to Lisk, a top-level blockchain launched in 2016, so that it can join the Ethereum ecosystem by migrating to Ethereum\u2019s layer 2.\n\nLisk will become part of OP Mainnet, Base, and other OP chains, distinguishing itself as the first level 1 to commit to Optimism\u2019s Superchain vision.\n\nThe addition of OP Stack support by Gelato underscores the platform\u2019s commitment to revolutionizing the blockchain landscape.\n\nThe democratization of access to a modular block space allows a wide range of creators to easily implement their own level 2 blockchains, ready for launch.\n\nThis crucial step unlocks the potential of the main cryptographic applications, ushering in a new era in the adoption of blockchain, as highlighted by Luis Schliesske, founder of Gelato.\n\nDesigned to mitigate congestion issues on the main Ethereum network, OP Stack represents the open-source codebase and standards that power the Optimism ecosystem, aiming to support the Superchain.\n\nThanks to Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, OP Stack not only manages the implementation, hosting, and monitoring of new Layer 2 chains, but also obtains native integrations with Gelato\u2019s leading Web3 middleware services.\n\nThese include automation, off-chain data, and account abstraction, which enable a superior user experience. Additionally, the platform provides immediate access to high-level web3 services such as Etherscan, The Graph, LayerZero, and many others.\n\nThe Web3 revolution of Gelato\n\nLevel 2 chains implemented with Gelato, including Lisk, not only gain the benefits of the underlying blockchain, but also a fully production-ready web3 development environment.\n\nThis is a milestone for web3 development, as developers have access for the first time to an OP chain with end-to-end services and all infrastructure dependencies implemented from the start.\n\nBen Jones, head scientist at the Optimism Foundation, expresses enthusiasm for the extension of support from Gelato to Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk.\n\nGelato has already demonstrated its efficiency by executing one million transactions on OP Mainnet for projects like Synthetix, Lyra, and Velodrome. Jones anticipates that Gelato, with its developer experience, will contribute to turning Superchain\u2019s vision into a tangible reality.\n\nThrough Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform, implementing your own complete OP chain of services becomes a simple process, without the need to write code.\n\nThis allows developers to focus on growing their core business, while Gelato handles the implementation and maintenance of the chain.\n\nDominic Schwenter, Chief Project Officer at Lisk, emphasizes that the use of Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to focus on creating products and tools appreciated by developers and end users, allocating resources to the development of Superchain.\n\nGelato and Optimism share a vision of a world where thousands of blockchains are interconnected, allowing for horizontal scaling of web3 applications. The Gelato Rollup-as-a-Service platform positions itself as a key component of this environment, managing clients\u2019 blockchains and providing an end-to-end development environment with essential infrastructure services for integrated developers."
