        "title": "Solana Is Ethereum, Co-Founder Says - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nSolana's co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently made a bold assertion about the future of blockchain interoperability and the role of Solana in the wider Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn a series of posts on the X social media platform, Yakovenko described Solana as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution through the Wormhole EigenLayer.\n\nThis would be possible because of advancements in \"danksharding,\" a scaling solution for Ethereum, suggesting a future where Solana blocks could be submitted into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum.\n\nExploring interoperability\n\nYakovenko's comments sparked a discussion about the technicalities and implications of such an integration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe clarified that Solana would only mint the wrapped version in its state after Ethereum achieves full finality, addressing concerns about potential reorganizations (reorgs) of the blockchain.\n\nThe concept of \"social consensus\" was emphasized, which suggests flexibility in how Solana and Ethereum might interact.\n\nThis flexibility could allow users to fork off into their own layer-1 1 (L1) blockchain, using a snapshot root. Yakovenko's stance indicates a broader view of what defines a layer-2 solution, challenging traditional boundaries and proposing a more fluid and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolana's market resurgence\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Solana has recently marked a significant achievement by surpassing Ethereum in a key trading metric: perpetual futures trading volume.\n\nSolana's lead in both perpetual futures and spot trading volumes, coupled with a soaring market capitalization, positions it as a formidable competitor in the crypto space, even challenging Ethereum's dominance in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.\n\nThe interest in the Solana ecosystem mostly stems from the meme coin frenzy that was fueled by the rise of the Bonk (BONK) token."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

        "content": "Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal believes that Ethereum (ETH) is poised to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming weeks and months as investors move their capital within the crypto markets to generate more gains.\n\nPal tells the 21,300 subscribers of his YouTube channel that Ethereum will \u201cmassively outperform\u201d Bitcoin just like how lower-rated junk bonds tend to surpass the higher-rated treasuries when investors rotate their capital.\n\nAccording to Pal, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will positively impact Ethereum as he expects market participants to reinvest their BTC gains in ETH.\n\n\u201cSo ETH is just doing what it\u2019s supposed to be doing. But it\u2019s not giving us the big surprise. I think that surprise comes the moment the ETF is out in Bitcoin and people will focus on the ETH ETF. And it\u2019ll bring the ETH ecosystem alive.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s been a story of Solana which I\u2019ve been long all year, and Bitcoin. That barbell has been the best trade in the world. Or, in fact, just saying SOL has been the best trade in the world bar none. But ETH, it will play catch-up, it will do well.\u201d\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, Pal says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s price action going forward is likely to mirror its 2015 bull market price action when Bitcoin witnessed a massive burst to the upside without a major correction.\n\n\u201cI think this cycle we\u2019re in now looks more like that 2015, 2016, 2017 than it did 2019-2021. [In] 2019, [Bitcoin] came out of the gates really, really fast then corrected, then we had Covid-19, which we\u2019re not going to repeat.\n\nI know many people are expecting \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to get a 50% collapse and you buy that one.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll get corrections. I think they\u2019re most likely more sideways, give or take a 20% to 30% range, because that\u2019s the world we live in in crypto.\n\nBut we should keep going into the end of 2025 if we\u2019re just repeating the same old cycle, which I think we are.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko jokes \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in ironic social media exchange - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nMentioned in this article"
