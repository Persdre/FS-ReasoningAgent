This is despite Ether being massively overbought and could play in favor of the upside.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $3,602.43 level holds as a resistance in the weekly timeframe, the Ethereum price could retest the midpoint of the market range at $2,684.92, with a break and close below it invalidating the bullish thesis."

        "title": "How Much Cheaper Will Dencun Really Make the Ethereum Ecosystem? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOn March 13, Ethereum is set to undergo its latest network upgrade, Dencun. While the event has certainly stirred excitement among the network\u2019s die-hard tech enthusiasts, it has generated relatively little mainstream buzz in contrast to the 2022 merge, which transitioned Ethereum to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nMake no mistake, though: According to the developers responsible for running the largest layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum, Dencun will constitute a seismic event in the blockchain\u2019s history\u2014one poised to make gas fees a thing of the past on scaling networks, and usher in a new era of possibility for on-chain development.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a new paradigm for how Ethereum operates,\u201d Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, which builds layer-2 network Optimism, told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cSince 2015, there has been nine years of stagnation in terms of user experience and capability set\u2014a lot of fundamental research had to be done,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat fundamental research is done. It is now \u2018put this thing into practice\u2019 mode.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNumerous other layer-2 developers who spoke with Decrypt echoed the same sentiment: Dencun will shift Ethereum into an entirely new gear, principally by making layer-2 transactions exponentially cheaper and easier to validate.\n\nWithin a month or two of Dencun\u2019s launch, once settlement contracts across all layer-2 networks have been updated, gas fees on most layer-2s should drop significantly\u2014so long as networks pass those savings onto users, Polygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman told Decrypt. Silverman said Polygon intends to ensure its users reap the sum of those cost reductions.\n\nTerence Tsao, a developer at Offchain Labs, which builds Arbitrum, told Decrypt he \u201ccan safely say\u201d that gas fees on layer-2 networks should immediately fall by 75% once Dencun is implemented, assuming current levels of network traffic.\n\nHow will gas prices plummet so quickly? It\u2019s all thanks to \u201cblobs,\u201d which will soon introduce a new, temporary method for data storage on Ethereum via a process called proto-danksharding. At present, data can only be stored on Ethereum forever, which is immensely expensive. Proto-danksharding will allow layer-2 data to instead be stored temporarily for a period of about a month. The process will be just as secure, but far cheaper.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo understand the potential impact of that change, says Polygon Labs\u2019 Silverman, think of Ethereum as a road. For the last several years, Ethereum could best be described as a rural backroad\u2014a reliable means to get from A to B, but one that\u2019s slow, and easily clogged.\n\nProto-danksharding will single-handedly expand Ethereum from that backroad into a four-lane highway, says Silverman. Eventually, full danksharding will grow the network to a 16-lane highway. Those extra lanes might come in handy at some point, or they might be overkill; regardless, it\u2019s Dencun that\u2019s bringing Ethereum\u2014to stay with the analogy\u2014into the age of modern transportation. And to developers like Silverman, the significance of that leap cannot be understated.\n\nGas fees won\u2019t just become miniscule post-Dencun; They may drop to the point that crypto companies and projects cover their cost\u2014just as Web2 giants like Google cover the costs of video conferencing and email, for example\u2014to entice users.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to enter a world where most users are just not going to experience gas at all,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cAnd it becomes abstracted away.\u201d\n\nThat gas-free future, to be clear, will exist on layer-2 networks, not the Ethereum mainnet. But post-Dencun, the overwhelming majority of retail user traffic is likely to shift\u2014permanently\u2014away from Ethereum proper, and onto layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, says Offchain Labs\u2019 Terence Tsao. And that appears to be exactly how Ethereum developers want it.\n\nBefore focusing on Arbitrum, Tsao previously worked on the Ethereum mainnet. He says Dencun will mark a major shift in how users interact with Ethereum, with the mainnet \u201cfading away into the background.\u201d It will still be essential, serving as an effective engine that secures data on layer-2 networks and facilitates communication between them.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of on-chain transactions\u2014for NFTs, for shoes, for cups of coffee\u2014will never again take place on the Ethereum mainnet, says Tsao. Stories of tens of millions of dollars burned attempting to mint NFTs will soon be a charming relic of a bygone era.\n\nKarl Floersch of OP Labs expects that Dencun will reinvent what it means to build applications\u2014and to exist on-chain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe've never seen what the world looks like when blockspace is in abundance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've never seen the kinds of applications that people can build.\u201d\n\nFloersch anticipates that by effectively eliminating any barrier to entry for integrating on-chain elements with any product, a renaissance of cross-pollination will soon occur across mediums, sites, and platforms. As just one example, he offered the idea of a video game that generates NFTs in-game, interacts with DeFi protocols, and leverages your social media presence to influence gameplay. All seamlessly, and all at effectively zero cost.\n\n\u201cOh my god, I've been dreaming of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm really excited for the world to know why we've been so excited about crypto.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
