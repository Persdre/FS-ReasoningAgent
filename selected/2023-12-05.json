        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission today said that it will need more than 45 days to evaluate a rule change that would allow Grayscale to convert its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline is January 25, 2024.\n\nThe news comes as the regulatory body received notice from investing giant BlackRock that its pending Bitcoin spot ETF has already drawn $100,000 in seed funding from an undisclosed investor.\n\nFor Grayscale, the decision comes two weeks after the SEC delayed a separate request from the crypto asset manager to evaluate its proposal for an Ethereum futures ETF. That application was submitted in September.\n\nThe reason given in both cases was the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" reads the SEC's official notice today.\n\nThat is, word for word, the same explanation the SEC provided last month.\n\nAs for BlackRock, its amended Form S-1 registration for its iShares Bitcoin Trust includes disclosure of a \"seed capital investor\" that's affiliated with BlackRock. The unnamed investor purchased 4,000 shares at a per-share price of $25 on October 27, for total proceeds of $100,000."
