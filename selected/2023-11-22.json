        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAccording to the latest data from 100eyes Crypto Scanner, Ethereum is approaching a horizontal support point at around $1,925.\n\nThis follows a dynamic 24-hour trading period where Ethereum's price fluctuated between $1,940.08 and $2,018.93, currently standing at $1,989.80.\n\nThis represents a 1.2% increase compared to the previous day, with its market capitalization now at approximately $239 billion and a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $23 billion.\n\nMore buying opportunities?\n\nHorizontal support is a significant concept in the trading of cryptocurrencies. It refers to a price level at which a downward trend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that Ethereum nears this key level of $1,925, investors and traders are closely monitoring its movement for potential buying opportunities or signs of a further price drop.\n\nThe top altcoin dropped in tandem with other major cryptocurrencies on Tuesday due to the bombshell Binance news.\n\nTraders are still greedy\n\nDespite this, Ethereum's current sentiment remains in 'greed' territory, with the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index indicating a score of 56 \u2014 suggesting that market sentiment is still optimistic.\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, ETH is up by 66% since the beginning of the year. This robust increase is a potential factor contributing to the prevailing optimistic sentiment among investors, even as the cryptocurrency approaches its horizontal support level.\n\nEthereum's performance over various periods has shown a mixed trend, with a 5-day decrease of 2.84% but an 11.34% rise over the past month and an 18.20% increase in the last three months."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum were mostly trading sideways on Wednesday after news that Binance's boss stepped down from the world's largest crypto exchange and pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations sent the BNB token plummeting.\n\nCoinGecko data showed that Bitcoin was trading for $36,609 as of this writing\u2014a drop of 2% in the past day. Over the past seven days, it's up 0.3%.\n\nWhile Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset, was up by more than 3%, trading hands for $2,034.\n\nBut Binance's BNB, the fourth biggest digital asset and the utility token for Binance's exchange, was continuing to drop\u2014and fast\u2014Wednesday morning Eastern Time. It had dropped in price by over 11% and was priced at $231 per token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYesterday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao agreed to step down from his role at the company as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The settlement also stipulates that the exchange has to make a complete exit from the U.S.\u2014that includes its Binance US exchange and the U.S. customers who were trading on the dotcom exchange.\n\nAs a result, traders are selling their BNB holdings. Approximately $3.3 billion worth of BNB has changed hands in the past 24 hours, almost all of it on Tether (USDT) trading pairs, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThere's a very short list of times BNB volume has been higher: During the 2021 bull market, after TerraUSD collapsed in May 2022 and the day Binance announced it had a tentative agreement to acquire FTX before calling the deal off. FTX filed for bankruptcy days later.\n\nOther major coins and tokens such as Avalanche, XRP, and Dogecoin all dipped in price. AVAX is suffering the most, having dropped 9% in the past day. XRP and DOGE have each fallen 2% since yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecentralized exhange Uniswap's UNI token surged in price, though, and was at the time of writing priced at $5.66\u2014a 12% 24-hour jump.\n\nThe DOJ said Tuesday that the crypto brand didn't have sufficient anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer controls in place. As a result, the platform was used by terrorists, cybercriminals and child abusers wanting to move funds.\n\nBinance agreed to pay a $4 billion settlement\u2014one of the biggest corporate penalties in U.S. history\u2014and exit the American market. Zhao pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "A new Ethereum layer-2 rollup, announced Monday, has already attracted $27 million in total value locked (TVL), but there\u2019s a twist: It doesn\u2019t yet exist.\n\nThe promised network, Blast, would launch as an optimistic rollup in February 2024, but its backers immediately began soliciting deposits into a smart contract \u201cbridge.\u201d\n\nIn the span of half a day, the contract has amassed enough ether (ETH) and dai (DAI) to put it at number 16 in rollup tracker L2Beat\u2019s TVL rankings, ahead of established names such as derivatives DEX Aevo and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nThe announcement touts Blast as \u201cthe only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins,\u201d meaning it taps into Ethereum staking yield by directing all ETH to Lido and uses DAI to tap MakerDAO\u2019s growing US Treasury bill yield through its Dai Savings Rate (DSR), currently at 5%.\n\nBlast\u2019s development team, led by pseudonymous Blur co-founder Pacman, raised $20 million from venture capital firms Paradigm and Standard Crypto, joined by a motley crew of angel investors and crypto influencers.\n\nEarly reaction has focused on the one-way nature of the \u201cbridge\u201d \u2014 once you cross you can\u2019t exit until after Blast actually launches and withdrawals are enabled.\n\nNormally, a bridge allows assets to flow both ways. This contract is apparently controlled by a five-key multi-signature wallet. However, of the five addresses, one contains no ether and has no transaction history, and the other four were recently funded by a single address.\n\nThat calls into question the independence of the signing cohort.\n\nAccording to Pacman, there\u2019s no need to worry.\n\n\u201cThe Blast Early Access bridge contract does use a multisig, and each signer is a unique contributor to Blast,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cThis is the same security model that other L2s like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum utilize \u2014 these L2s are all upgradeable via multisig as well.\u201d\n\nBlockworks also contacted Paradigm and Standard Crypto for comment.\n\nL2Beat designated the project \u201cupcoming\u201d rather than \u201cactive\u201d as a result of its current implementation.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe use of Lido has drawn the ire of Ethereum community members concerned with centralization risk in staking providers, including Dankrad Feist, who called it \u201ca very bad idea\u201d on X.\n\n\u201cETH and liquid staking derivatives are different assets with different risk profiles (and rewards), and users should have a choice about which one they want to use,\u201d he said.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, given that Paradigm is an investor in both Lido and Blur.\n\nCritics also question the use of a multi-level-marketing style referral campaign, which doles out points, of unknown value, to incentivize sending invitations to prospective new users.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe site explicitly promises an airdrop based on early access participation. Points earned are expected to be redeemable in May 2024.\n\nPoints systems have increasingly been used as a growth bootstrapping mechanism by protocol developers \u2014 including Pacman\u2019s prior marketing of Blur \u2014 and are widely seen as a precursor to an airdrop or something else of value.\n\nUpdated Nov. 21, 2024 at 12:15 pm ET with comment from Pacman and Nov. 22 at 5:57 am ET with additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2023, Blast, a new second-layer solution on Ethereum (ETH), caused unprecedented hype on social media. By press time, over $87 million in liquidity is injected into this on-chain bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is Blast, novel Ethereum staking L2: Highlights\n\nBlast L2 protocol attempts to change the way Ether (ETH) is staked on-chain. It employs a number of eccentric mechanisms designed to offer more profitable and seamless staking for ETH holders.\n\nBlast is promoted as a second-layer protocol on top of Ethereum (ETH), the largest programmable blockchain.\n\nPer the statement of its team, Blast automatically stakes all injected crypto in Lido and redistributes staking rewards between investors if its L2.\n\nAlso, users who bridge stablecoins, automatically get USDB, Blast's auto-rebasing stablecoin, to enjoy additional yield from MakerDAO's on-chain T-bill protocol.\n\nBlast team will enable withdrawals on Feb. 24, 2024, while redemption of Blast Points is set to kick off in May.\n\nThe project siphoned over $87 million in Ether and stablecoins in less than 24 hours upon launch.\n\nImage by 21 Shares via Dune Analytics\n\nBy press time, its TVL metric demonstrates over 20,000% daily growth, which makes it arguably the fastest growing L2 in Ethereum (ETH) history.\n\nBlast, most overhyped Ethereum L2 in Q4, 2023\n\nBlast, a novel L2 on Ethereum, is attempting to make ETH staking more profitable via the concept of \"native yield.\"\n\nBlast L2: Basics\n\nBlast is the second-layer solution on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Per its official statement, Blast is developed by contributors of Blur, a dominant NFT marketplace. Also, it is said to be funded by heavyweight VCs Paradigm, Standard Crypto and Primitive Ventures with the participation of top angel investors Andrew Kang and Santiago Santos.\n\nSimply put, the protocol attempts to offer more inclusive and profitable staking for ETH and stablecoin holders than its competitors.\n\nWith Blast, ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2. Ether-denominated yield from an L1 staking protocol (initially Lido) is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nBlast attempts to integrate real-world assets into the ETH staking process. All of its customers who inject stablecoins get USDB, Blast's native asset. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO protocol pegged to U.S. 10-year T-bills.\n\nBlast L2: When will the token arrive?\n\nBlast released a three-step timeline for its operations:\n\nEarly access (already live from Nov. 21): Bridge goes live, Blast Points distribution starts. Mainnet launch (expected on Feb. 24, 2024): dApps go live, ETH withdrawals enabled by team. Redemption (expected in May 24, 2024): Blast Points redemption activated.\n\nUsers will only be able to withdraw what they inject into Blast three months after the start of its early access campaign.\n\nBlast Ethereum L2: Risks\n\nBesides the high volatility of cryptocurrency and other \"regular\" considerations necessary for crypto investors, there are some extra risks associated with the project so far:\n\nNobody can predict the price of Ether and associated assets on the day of the unlocking; the stakes-USD-denominated valuation can either spike or shrink.\n\nAirdrop of token is not guaranteed; its rules are also yet to be announced.\n\nInterest in building dApps on this L2 cannot be predicted.\n\nAs such, users should be extra cautious when working with every early-stage cryptocurrency protocol."
