        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nAfter a phenomenal run, Bitcoin cooled down. The price of Bitcoin is now at $51,064, after a modest 2% weekly drop.\n\nCash had flooded into the market as retail investors showed interest in the newly approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but that has finally slowed.\n\nStill, the asset is up significantly since the start of the year, when it was trading for $42,245 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Ethereum (ETH) has been the star of the week. The price of ETH crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, and now it's trading for $2,956, a 6% jump over the past seven days.\n\nInvestors are interested in the asset again as more major Wall Street firms apply to release a spot Ethereum ETF. The SEC has until May to approve or deny such a product.\n\nAnd Uniswap (UNI), the 16th biggest token, is doing really well: it's up 66% this week and priced at $12.41. It shot up sharply yesterday on news that the foundation behind the popular decentralized exchange wants to overhaul the governance system to reward users who stake the token.\n\nThe idea is a \"large-scale upgrade to Uniswap protocol governance to incentivize active, engaged, and thoughtful delegation,\" the foundation said. A vote will come in March.\n\nOver the past week, UNI has been the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy far, though, the most impressive performers have been AI tokens, which boomed along with AI sticks after Nvidia's earnings report. The top chipmaker reported $22.1 billion in revenue in the final quarter of 2023, beating analyst estimates.\n\nAs a result, AI-associated digital assets are soaring. Worldcoin (WLD) is up 71% over the past seven days, while SingularityNET (AGIX) doubled before settling at a 71% gain for the week.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko believes that Ethereum (ETH) could appreciate to a five-figure price.\n\nYusko says in a new Altcoin Daily interview that based on the Ethereum versus Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC), ETH could go up by 410% from its present level in a scenario where Bitcoin ends up hitting the $150,000 mark.\n\n\u201cI probably have no reason to go against what has existed for a long time which is the ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It used to be almost exactly 10-to-1. So if Bitcoin was $20,000, Ethereum would be $2,000\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say Bitcoin gets to $150,000 like I think it will. And let\u2019s say we don\u2019t go all the way back to [a Bitcoin-to-Ethereum ratio of] 10-to-1 but we go to\u2026 Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1.5. So that\u2019s [an Ethereum price of] $10,000.\n\nI think there are a lot of people that have that number in their brain. And a lot of people say, \u2018Well that\u2019s not enough.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s say it gets all the way back to 10-to-1. Then that would be [an Ethereum price of] $15,000. So, comfortably somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,921 at time of writing.\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s expected price performance relative to that of Bitcoin (BTC), the hedge fund veteran says,\n\n\u201cI could see a bigger rally in Ethereum than Bitcoin. And that\u2019s kind of what you would expect in the pump part, in the final meteoric parabolic move. Ethereum has historically outperformed Bitcoin and it probably should again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $51,904 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "After Dencun, Ethereum devs set sights on Electra upgrade - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Dencun and Electra upgrades shape Ethereum\u2019s development landscape.\n\nETH\u2019s price witnessed a minor correction, while network growth and velocity fell.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum [ETH] experienced a substantial surge in its price, reflecting heightened market activity. Behind this surge was significant developments within the Ethereum network, poised to propel the growth of this cryptocurrency further.\n\nNew updates\n\nThe recent Ethereum developers\u2019 call, ACDC #128, unveiled crucial updates set to shape the network\u2019s future. The eagerly awaited Dencun upgrade took center stage, with all client teams (excluding lodestar) finalizing software versions.\n\nThese versions, along with the lodestar candidate client, are undergoing thorough testing on a mainnet shadow fork.\n\nFlashbots, a key player, plans to release Dendon-ready MEV-Boost software early next week.\n\nNotably, the Dencun mainnet activation is scheduled for 13th March, emphasizing the urgency for validator node operators to upgrade their EL, CL, and MEV-Boost software promptly.\n\nThe impact of the Cancun upgrade is poised to be significant. With Flashbots gearing up to enhance MEV-Boost capabilities, the Ethereum network anticipates increased efficiency and security, potentially influencing market sentiment positively.\n\nAnother pivotal development on the horizon is the Electra upgrade. Developers have initiated work on Electra, encompassing EIP 6110, EIP 7002, and EIP 7549. These proposals aim to enhance validator deposits, triggerable exits in the execution layer, and reposition committee index outside attestation, respectively.\n\nFurther refinement and consideration of inclusion lists will determine their seamless integration into Electra without delaying other essential code changes.\n\nIn parallel, discussions on lowering staking rewards have emerged. As the amount of staked ETH rises, stakeholders engage in deliberations on potentially reducing ETH issuance.\n\nThis ongoing discourse is critical, as it signifies the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to adapt and optimize network dynamics in response to changing conditions.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nDespite these advancements, Ethereum\u2019s price, at $2,935.49, reflects a 2.63% decline in the last 24 hours. More notably, network growth for the ETH token has experienced a decline, signaling waning interest among new users.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nA lack of interest from new addresses could severely impact the ability of ETH\u2019s price to see green.\n\nMoreover, the velocity of ETH being transferred also declined. The reduced velocity indicated a lower frequency of interactions around ETH, suggesting a potential decrease in overall engagement."

        "content": "The crypto ecosystem has gone through several dramatic changes in the past few years. In 2020 and 2021, the industry was driven by hype and speculation only to crash in 2022 and early 2023. There was no better example of this hype cycle than Solana (CRYPTO: SOL).\n\nIt peaked at more than $250 per token and dropped below $10 per coin after the collapse of FTX. But this continues to be one of the lowest-cost and highest-throughput blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, and if you think the innovation and disruption of crypto is from utility and not just speculation, this is still a cryptocurrency to hold long term.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat people do in crypto matters\n\nThe health of a blockchain can be seen in the activity of developers and users. This can be judged by developer activity. Solana reports 2,500 to 3,000 developers consistently, short of only Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) at about 6,000 developers.\n\nOn the user side, transactions per second is a great gauge of how much activity there is on a blockchain. Solana averages between 3,000 and 4,000 transactions per second compared to a blockchain like Ethereum at around 13 transactions per second.\n\nThese two factors together will give you an idea of the health of the blockchain itself. If developers are building it and users are using it, the blockchain has a likely chance of growing in the future.\n\nETFs and the future of crypto investing\n\nWe have seen billions of dollars flow into the crypto industry over the past month after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to speculation that Ethereum will be the next to get an ETF and more cryptocurrencies may follow.\n\nSolana could get an ETF if Ethereum is approved. It has similar characteristics and smart contracts to Ethereum and has strong institutional and consumer interest.\n\nBut I don't think it's likely Solana will hold a place like Bitcoin in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is more like digital gold that investors simply want to hold long term, whereas Solana is more of a utility coin for the blockchain. But there could be buyers for both kinds of assets.\n\nSolana's uncertainty\n\nThe one downside of Solana is the coin itself is not as important to the ecosystem as it is to something like the Ethereum blockchain. Yes, there's a proof-of-stake element to Solana, but a lot of transactions simply happened with USDC stablecoin as the medium of exchange.\n\nThe future of Solana may be driven by a USDC-denominated token or some other fiat-backed token, and not the Solano cryptocurrency that we see today. This may mean less upside with the cryptocurrency itself, despite being the native coin to the blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven all of these factors, I think the biggest reason to be bullish on Solana long term is the fact that this is where innovation development and transactions are taking place on the blockchain today. There's more activity and innovation on Solana than almost any other blockchain. And activity and USDC we are using the Solana blockchain for normal financial transactions without even knowing it in the future. That will be a truly disruptive future, and is a great reason to buy Solana.\n\nIs it too late? I don't think it is.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Solana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Solana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Solana wasn\u2019t one of them.
