        "title": "Bitcoin's (BTC) Potential Surge to $220K by Next Halving; New AI Crypto Could Mirror Ethereum's (ETH) Success - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) block subsidy halving is an event investors eagerly anticipate, occurring roughly every four years (210,000 blocks). Many analysts predict that following the halving, the price of BTC could surge to $220,000 because Bitcoin\u2019s supply would have been reduced by half. Meanwhile, InQubeta (QUBE), a cryptocurrency focused on artificial intelligence, appears to follow Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) successful model.\n\nFor a few months now, InQubeta has been growing traction and value among investors, cementing its standing as the best crypto investment for profitable returns. Since the QUBE presale has been remarkably successful in its early stages, analysts now predict that QUBE could mirror Ethereum\u2019s success. Let\u2019s explore InQubeta\u2019s potential to match Ethereum\u2019s success and the expectations of Bitcoin\u2019s price to surge on its next halving.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s (QUBE) Outstanding Performance Points at AI Crypto Dominance\n\nThe QUBE token has increased steadily since InQubeta launched its presale. The tokens\u2019 value has increased throughout its first five stages, from $0.007 to $0.0161, demonstrating why InQubeta is the best crypto investment for substantial gains. The project\u2019s early success in securing investor confidence indicates that it could perform as well as Ethereum in the crypto market. Growing presale investors have made it possible for the project to sell more than 527 million tokens so far, amassing over $5.2 million, putting it on track to become the best DeFi crypto.\n\nInQubeta aims to make investments in artificial intelligence (AI) more accessible and democratic. The idea is to enable fractional investment through QUBE in AI startups using smart contracts and the blockchain. Investors can help AI startups develop and succeed by using this tactic, regardless of their financial status.\n\nPopular NFTs (non-fungible tokens) can also be minted by AI startups and sold on the NFT marketplace to QUBE holders. The NFT marketplace opens doors for investors and enables entrepreneurs to list their popular NFTs in front of a large audience. Given that these NFTs are fractionalized, they are inexpensive, and investors will make money off of them as these startups grow.\n\nQUBE is a deflationary token that can hold its value over time. Token holders, at the same time, have a voice in the decisions and development of the platform. There is also a 12-week vesting period for QUBE. Through vesting, InQubeta releases tokens progressively, potentially fostering confidence as the best DeFi crypto and boosting QUBE prices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Speculated to Reach $220,000 by the Next Halving Secures Investors\u2019 Optimism\n\nBitcoin halving is a quadrennial event whereby the amount of Bitcoin given to miners is cut in half to fuel the coin\u2019s scarcity. This halving causes the value of BTC to rise over time, making it one of the most sought-after cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Archive predicts that in 18 months, Bitcoin will likely trade at $220,000. Its prediction is based on the fact that, twelve months after the last halving, BTC\u2019s price surged six times its trading value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Empowers Innovation Through its Proof-of-Stake Mechanism\n\nAbout a year has passed since Ethereum completed the \u201cMerge,\u201d which changed the blockchain\u2019s consensus process from one based on proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Users could earn a passive revenue stream, and the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency was significantly increased by staking their ETH to secure the network. This has been viewed as a positive development for the ETH network overall. Many users have already staked twenty percent of all circulating Ether.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto market anticipates Bitcoin\u2019s potential surge to $220,000 by the next halving, InQubeta has emerged as a contender that could mirror the success of Ethereum. InQubeta is a high-growth investment opportunity that has the potential to perform as promised, if not better, considering the remarkable performance of the presale. It is still cheap and it could yield massive returns when it launches. Following QUBE\u2019s exchange listing and the start of InQubeta\u2019s widespread adoption, a buying frenzy might push the cryptocurrency\u2019s value to all-time highs.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.
