        "content": "A trader who accurately called Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 price floor is predicting massive moves to the upside for two top 50 altcoins.\n\nStarting with Solana (SOL), the analyst and trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 232,000 followers on the social media platform X that the sixth-largest crypto asset by market cap will surge in value against Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\nAccording to the analyst, the bullish SOL/BTC chart indicates that Solana will likely soar against the US dollar.\n\nThis was another banger SOL/BTC picolow call. Since the original post, it has rallied impulsively from the low in five waves and has now done yet another ABC down. SOL/BTC is about to full send in my opinion.\n\nI have no idea where USD pair goes in terms of levels, but I genuinely think it will be $140+.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading at $73.65 at time of writing and would need to appreciate by over 90% to hit the target of at least $140.\n\nTurning to the governance token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave (AAVE), Bluntz says that the 50th-largest altcoin by market cap looks poised for a big breakout rally.\n\n\u201cMonster three-day candle on AAVE. Legit gearing up to gigasend.\n\nPlenty of juice in the tank in my opinion, shouldn\u2019t be aiming for anything less than $200 in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAAVE is trading at $108.13 at time of writing and would need to go up by 85% to reach a target of $200.\n\nOn Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), Bluntz says he\u2019s now bullish on the two crypto assets after initially expressing reservations. Initially, the pseudonymous crypto analyst had warned of a possible downward move for Bitcoin and Ethereum after the two leading crypto assets pulled back from their ascending channel highs.\n\n\u201cOvernight price action made me do a 180 on this take. Sh*t looks bullish as f**k again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $42,113 at time of writing while Ethereum is worth $2,244.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "After a year of dormancy, a significant Ethereum whale has reemerged, creating ripples in the cryptocurrency market, with Lookonchain reporting this unexpected move. The whale, silent for over twelve months, initiated a substantial selling spree, offloading 18,865 ETH for a staggering 42 million DAI through four newly created wallets. This activity translates to an average selling price of $2,229 per ETH.\n\nThe market has been abuzz with speculation and analysis following this development. The revived whale\u2019s actions have led to the sale of a considerable amount of Ethereum, amounting to a current value of $12.5 million, with 5,588 ETH remaining in their possession. This event has caught the attention of both investors and analysts, given the significant amount of cryptocurrency involved and its potential impact on the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrasting Whale Behaviors\n\nThis selling trend by a dormant whale contrasts sharply with the behaviours observed in other segments of the Ethereum whale community. Crypto analyst Ali highlighted a contrasting scenario where several of the largest Ethereum whales have been actively accumulating ETH.\n\nETH/USD price chart\n\nOver the past week, these whales have reportedly added over 100,000 ETH, valued at approximately $230 million, to their holdings. This divergence in strategies underscores the varied approaches and sentiments prevalent among significant investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Current Market Position\n\nAmidst these developments, Ethereum\u2019s market performance remains a focal point. At the time of reporting, ETH experienced a slight upturn, with a 1.12% increase over the last 24 hours, bringing its value to $2,255.\n\nIntoTheBlock data suggests that Ethereum is trading in a crucial zone, with significant support and resistance levels identified. The $2,332 and $2,403 price points are key barriers in ETH\u2019s potential ascent towards the $3,000 mark, while support is around $2,127.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees continue to play a critical role in its market dynamics. The past week saw approximately 35,000 ETH burned, continuing a trend of negative net issuance that started in early November. These factors collectively contribute to the ever-changing landscape of Ethereum\u2019s market as investors and analysts closely watch these developments unfold.\n\nRead Also: XRP Ledger (XRPL) Hosts Phase 2 of Palau Stablecoin Project\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.
