        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Jumps 5%, This Breakout Can Trigger Bull Run - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is posing a strong recovery in the market jumping over 5% and shooting past $3,100 levels. After facing strong selling pressure for a few weeks, the ETH bulls are once again taking up the charge with the SEC decision on the spot Ethereum ETF approval just a week from now.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Breakout\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is currently trading around $3,087. It has recently broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe. If the price manages to close above this breakout level, we can anticipate a bullish momentum for Ethereum, as the falling wedge pattern is typically a bullish indicator.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, one must note that Ethereum has severely underperformed Bitcoin throughout this year in 2024 so far. The ETH/BTC price ratio reached a three-year low on Thursday at 0.044. Since the Merge, the correlation between BTC and ETH has decreased by 45%, diminishing the likelihood of \u201cthe flippening\u201d occurring in the near future.\n\nETH Can Suprise on the Upside\n\nWhile Ethereum has continued to stay under constant selling pressure, popular market analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that ETH could be gearing up for a strong surge on the upside. He wrote: \u201cComing weeks are going to be big for Ethereum and the whole ecosystem and markets are super negative\u201d.\n\nIn its latest research report published last Wednesday, crypto exchange Coinbase stated that Ethereum could surprise investors on the upside. Ether could potentially see an upside surprise in the coming months,\u201d the report stated, highlighting that the cryptocurrency lacks \u201csignificant supply-side pressures\u201d such as token unlocks or miner sales.\n\nFurthermore, Coinbase believes that one must not understate the importance of spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cWe believe the market may be underestimating the timing and likelihood of potential approval, leaving room for upside surprises,\u201d Coinbase stated.\n\n\u201cEven if the first deadline of May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection, we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision,\u201d the note said.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Sees End-of-Correction With This Resistance Breakout - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap entered a fresh rally in mid-week and rebounded from $2860 monthly support. This renewed buying interest bolstered by the Bitcoin price jump to $67000 on Friday has surged the ETH price to an 8.7% gain. However, an analysis of the daily chart shows the rising Ether price is heading to a crucial resistance indicating an upcoming pivot momentum for this asset.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Charts Might Turn Bullish Now: ETH Targets $4k?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Poised for Rebound as Falling Channel Pattern Nears Break\n\nIn the daily time frame chart, the Ethereum price shows the formation of a falling channel pattern. The two parallel trendlines acting as dynamic resistance and support have plunged the ETH value from $4084 to $2864 support indicating a nearly 30% loss.\n\nWhile the BTC price rally bolsters a new recovery sentiment in altcoin, the ETH price could remain trapped in a correction until the chart setup is intact.\n\nHaving said that, the Ether coin is heading higher to challenge the upper boundary of the Channel pattern. After a 3% upswing, the coin buyers escape the range of this pattern, signaling the end-of-correction trend.\n\nAccording to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in the middle of its bull cycle. Ju highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend that historically lasts around two years.\n\nIf this pattern continues, the current bull cycle might extend until April 2025. The accompanying chart from CryptoQuant illustrates the growth rate difference between Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and realized cap, showing similar cycles approximately every two years.\n\nThis potential uptrend significantly influences the altcoin market bolstering top assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP to lead to higher rallies.\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the channel pattern will accelerate the buying momentum and assist buyers in rechallenging the $4080 high.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The dynamic resistance of the 50-day EMA prevents the ETH price from breaching the channel pattern.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The ADX slope falling below 18% hints the prevailing bearish momentum is weakening.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Addresses Major Concerns by Ethereum Community - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin has published a new article outlining upcoming Ethereum improvements, particularly focusing on PeerDAS, the Verkle tree transition and decentralized methods for storing history as proposed in EIP-4444.\n\nGrats @dankrad @peter_szilagyi you got me to interrupt my work on EIPs and make a twitter response that turned into an unscheduled poast \ud83d\ude00https://t.co/mmVaiEV68K \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 17, 2024\n\nEthereum's founder emphasized the importance of decentralization, a key element of ETH's unique development strategy. He also addressed issues like Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and the balance between minimizing and quarantining it.\n\nThe article was inspired by a series of tweets from long-time Geth core developer Peter Szilagyi, who expressed concerns about MEV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMEV became an issue, so instead of trying to find solutions against it, we've glorified it and are now catering the protocol and infra around it to proprietary MEV builders instead of local block producers. It's futile to fight against MEV os might as well lean hard on it, right? \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) May 16, 2024\n\nButerin noted that many of these concerns are already being addressed by ongoing protocol features and that additional issues can be resolved through realistic adjustments to the current road map.\n\nMEV\n\nButerin discussed Ethereum's approach to managing Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which emerged around 2020 when miners started using complex strategies to gain extra revenue from DeFi activities. This development compromised the fairness of block proposing, favoring larger actors.\n\nTwo strategies address MEV: minimization and quarantining. MEV minimization involves creating alternatives like Cowswap and using encrypted mempools to reduce exploitable information.\n\nMEV quarantining accepts MEV but limits its impact by separating block proposing from content selection. Validators focus on proposing blocks, while specialized builders choose block contents via an auction protocol.\n\nButerin supports a mix of both strategies, acknowledging that MEV will not disappear entirely and emphasizing the need to reduce the potential harm from builders to maintain decentralization.\n\nDecentralization\n\nButerin also emphasized the importance of making Ethereum nodes accessible, a central issue in blockchain decentralization. He highlighted EIP-4444 and Verkle trees as key technologies to reduce node hardware requirements, potentially to under 100 gigabytes or even near-zero by offloading history storage.\n\nButerin acknowledged concerns about centralization if responsibility for state maintenance and proofs is offloaded, suggesting an alternative: storing old history in a peer-to-peer network where each node holds a small portion of the data. This would ensure robustness with thousands of copies and potentially use erasure coding for added reliability.\n\nHe stressed that while Ethereum Layer 1 should support Layer 2 projects, it must maintain scalability and the unique properties that make Ethereum distinct, ensuring continued decentralization and security."

        "content": "Crypto industry innovator Vitalik Buterin recently took to the X app on Saturday to highlight one of the things he appreciates about the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Promotes Open Discourse\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder likes the fact that the Ethereum ecosystem does not have a culture that impedes free speech. Buterin claimed that Ethereum does not stop its community members or any members of the public from speaking their minds on any matter.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026..even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem,\u201d Ethereum co-founder added.\n\nWhile the concept of \u201copen discourse\u201d may not mean much to some sects, Buterin highlighted that others take it seriously. Noteworthy, Vitalik\u2019s statement does not appear to be a direct jab at any protocol but it suggests that he might have discovered a trend amongst digital assets ecosystems.\n\nProbably a case of some self-acclaimed top developers downplaying the opinion of their community members or that of \u201csmaller\u201d developers. The statement from Vitalik Buterin mirrors his stance on the matter of free speech and Ethereum\u2019s part in achieving it.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder never fails to laud the capabilities of the ecosystem or its superseding performance over its counterparts. Only a few days ago, he unveiled a groundbreaking proposal aimed at addressing the pressing challenges faced by the Ethereum network.\n\nIn one of his articles, Buterin advocated for the adoption of \u2018Multidimensional Gas Pricing,\u2019 a concept designed to revolutionize the management of network resources. He believes that Ethereum can enhance efficiency and scalability by pricing different resources separately.\n\nHe sees the capacity for this addition to pave the way for a more robust and sustainable network infrastructure. This was after Buterin requested that quantum resistance, a new proposal that will bring longer-term sustainability to the protocol\u2019s smart contract push, be added to Ethereum.\n\nCrypto Community Expects Spot ETH ETF Decision\n\nDespite these multiple developments and advancement, Ethereum is still facing regulatory challenges with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Chairman of the Commission Gary Gensler has remain fixated on categorizing the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap as security.\n\nThis classification seem to have negatively impacted on the possibility of receiving approval for the spot Ethereum ETF applications made by top investment asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nWith a mix of optimism and pessimism, the broad crypto community have their fingers crossed waiting patiently for May 23rd, the decision date for VanEck as scheduled by the SEC.\n\nRead More: XRP Lawsuit: Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals Dates For Lawsuit Conclusion\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Coinbase analysts expressed confidence that spot ETH ETFs would be approved.\n\nVitalik Buterin has responded to criticisms labeled at Ethereum developers, stating how they have been addressing some of the concerns of community members.\n\nEthereum could see a further rise as it outperforms Bitcoin for the first time in May.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a quick rally on Friday, posting a 5% gain as its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, responded to recent criticisms from the crypto community. Coinbase analysts have also expressed confidence that spot ETH ETFs would debut in the market soon.\n\nRead more: Ethereum drops below $3,000 again, spot ETH ETF sparks debate in crypto community\n\nDaily digest market movers: Processing speed, Buterin's response\n\nCoinbase analysts have said that spot Ethereum ETFs would debut in the market despite the silence from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) towards issuers. \"As crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it\u2019s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,\" said Coinbase analyst David Han.\n\nHe added that if the first deadline on May 23 sees a rejection from the SEC, \"there\u2019s a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, following Ethereum's slow price growth compared to Bitcoin and Solana, many crypto community members on X have targeted core Ethereum developers through a series of criticisms.\n\nMany criticized Ethereum's \"acceptance of MEV\" after the Department of Justice arrested two brothers for an MEV-related exploit on the number one smart contract blockchain. Others complained that Ethereum folks need to post more about the protocol and its updates.\n\nRead more: US Department of Justice charges brothers for alleged 12-second MEV fraud\n\nOne X user, @chainyoda, shared his plight:\n\nEthereum has a very bad case of cosmos infection.

This cycle all the ethereum devs and investors speak only PhD eg based sequencer, shared sequencer, intercontinental rollup... and one else gives a fk \u2014 chainyoda (@chainyoda) May 17, 2024\n\nMore importantly, Geth core developer Peter Szilagyi expressed dissatisfaction with the several upgrades the Ethereum network has undergone in a short while. \"My criticism is that you (Ethereum developers have) [...] have abandoned due process and rushed to hotfix things.\"\n\nPrivate transactions. Check.\n\nProprietary settlements (MEV). Check.\n\nStaked Ether issued by central auth. Check.\n\n\n\n0 local miner tips will nuke local stakers.\n\nGigagas hardware reqs will nuke local nodes.\n\n\n\nVoila, the banking system recreated. All privately held and operated. \u2014 P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi (karalabe.eth) (@peter_szilagyi) May 16, 2024\n\nThe increased concerns sparked a series of posts from several Ethereum core contributors, including Josh Stark, Tim Beiko, Dankrad Feist and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nButerin gave a detailed response to these criticisms in a blog post, stating that the concerns raised by community members are valid and \"are already being addressed by protocol features that are already in-progress.\"\n\nHe also stated that several other concerns from the community can be \"addressed by very realistic tweaks to the current roadmap.\" Buterin addressed three major areas that he believes form the majority of the concerns raised:\n\nMEV and builder dependence\n\nLiquid staking\n\nHardware requirement of nodes\n\nHe discussed how Verkle trees, EIP-4444, robust solo staking, and a peer-pressuring development process for MEV reduction can solve these issues.\n\n\"There is a near-unlimited number of blockchain projects aiming for the niche of \u2018we can be super-fast, we'll think about decentralization later.\u2019 I don't think Ethereum should be one of those projects,\" said Buterin.\n\n\"We should have deep respect for the properties that make Ethereum unique, and continue to work to maintain and improve on those properties as Ethereum scales,\" he added.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could attempt to break $3,251 resistance\n\nEthereum posted a 5% gain on Friday after it broke the $3,103 resistance. The rise follows a general appreciation of assets in the crypto market. However, Ethereum notably outperformed Bitcoin in the past 24 hours after several community members highlighted the ETH/BTC ratio was nearing a bottom.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum shows slight bullish signs, SEC faces several hurdles in attempts to deny spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nAs a result, ETH short liquidations are outpacing longs for the first time. With a total liquidation of $24.5 million in the past 24 hours, short liquidations sit at $17.54 million compared to $6.76 million long liquidations, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nThe recent ETH rise has also caused a spike in ETH open interest, which increased by 6.6% in the past 24 hours. This signifies renewed investor interest in ETH, meaning it may see less sideways movement in the coming days.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nIf renewed confidence prevails, ETH could attempt to break the $3,161 resistance and, if successful, move past the $3,251 mark. However, it's important to watch out for volatility in the days leading up to the SEC's decision on spot ETH ETFs on May 23."
