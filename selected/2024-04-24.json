        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Franklin Templeton, initially anticipated for May, to a new deadline of June 11.\n\nThe SEC also delayed the deadline for the agency\u2019s decision on Grayscale\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application to June 23.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC is soliciting public feedback on a revised ETF proposal from BlackRock, which now includes a cash redemption model, a change from the original direct Ethereum exchange mechanism.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s proposal, initially submitted in November 2023, has been revised to better align with the SEC\u2019s regulatory framework, mirroring the cash redemption feature of previously approved Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has maintained a cautious approach to cryptocurrency ETFs despite approving spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETFs, approved in January, have since provided investors a regulated trading vehicle for the cryptocurrency and have experienced a cumulative total net inflow of US$12.42 billion.\n\nThe potential approval of Ethereum ETFs would provide investors with access to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, marking another step toward the integration of digital assets into conventional investment portfolios."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely But 'Bad News Already Priced In': Standard Chartered - Benzinga",
        "content": "While investors looking for an easy way into Ethereum ETH/USD via ETFs might face a wait, investment bank Standard Chartered remains optimistic about the future of digital assets.\n\nWhat Happened: Despite revising their previous May timeline for US approval of Ether ETFs, the bank believes the market is well-positioned for a rebound, Coindesk reported. Prediction market Polymarket assigns only a 16% chance to a spot Ethereum approval by May 31.\n\nCrypto Headwinds And Silver Linings\n\nStandard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who had previously predicted a May 23 approval for spot Ether ETFs, highlighted several challenges impacting digital assets.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) by suing Uniswap, U.S. Treasury yields have jumped, Federal Reserve rate cuts have been pushed back, and BTC and ETH \u2014 as risky assets \u2014 have been pulled lower by the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East,\u201d Kendrick stated in a research report.\n\nThis array of negative factors has tempered the immediate outlook for Ethereum\u2019s integration into mainstream financial products.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Standard Chartered remains optimistic about the future of digital assets.\n\nThe bank reassures that the worst may be over for the markets, stating, \u201cThe bad news is already priced in for bitcoin and ether, and positive structural drivers are expected to take over again.\u201d\n\nThey maintain a bullish end-of-year price target of $150,000 for Bitcoin and $8,000 for Ether, which were trading around $66,800 and $3,237 respectively at the time of the report.\n\nAlso Read: Mt. Gox Creditors See Repayment Light At The End Of The Tunnel\n\nWhy It Matters: The report also noted significant market adjustments, citing the largest daily liquidation of leveraged long positions in the Bitcoin futures market since October 2023, which occurred on April 13 in response to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThis event removed $261 million from the market, signaling a \u201cmuch cleaner\u201d market positioning moving forward.\n\nFurthermore, the initial surge in Bitcoin spot ETF inflows has slowed, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as rising U.S. Treasury yields and ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n\nWhile the first wave of ETF buying appears largely complete, the integration of these funds into broader macro funds is anticipated, although this transition may require some time.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: As discussions on the future of digital assets continue, Benzinga\u2019s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will delve deeper into these topics, exploring how shifts in regulatory and market landscapes could shape the trajectory of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRead Next: Crypto Lobby Group Sues SEC Over New Dealer Rule\n\nImage: Pixabay"

        "content": "The fervor surrounding Ethereum ETH/USD exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continues to build, particularly after the successful launch of multiple Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs earlier this year.\n\nHowever, the path to approval for Ethereum ETFs faces continued regulatory scrutiny, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) engaging in a detailed review process with prospective issuers.\n\nGrayscale Intensifies Efforts with Revised S3 Prospectus\n\nDespite facing regulatory headwinds, Grayscale, a leader in digital currency asset management, has not relented in its push for a Spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe firm manages approximately $10.87 billion in its Ethereum Trust ETHE and has recently updated its registration through an S3 prospectus, aiming to elevate its ETHE to the NYSE Arca.\n\nThis filing is a critical move to transition the trust into a more accessible ETF format for investors.\n\n\u201cToday we submitted new regulatory filings that would further expand our product suite,\u201d Grayscale remarked, reaffirming its commitment to providing investors with access to Ethereum in a regulated framework.\n\nThe decision from the SEC, however, has been deferred to June 11, 2024, as the commission requires more time to consider the complexities of such financial products.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Net $31.6M Inflows As Hong Kong Readies For ETF Launches\n\nBlackRock Maintains Course Amid Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nSimilarly, BlackRock continues its pursuit of an Ethereum ETF, having amended its 19b-4 application. However, the outlook from analysts remains cautious.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that this would expedite an approval is slim to none,\u201d stated James Seyffart, an ETF analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, indicating only a 25% chance of a favorable decision by the previously anticipated May 23 deadline.\n\nThe hesitance from the SEC has led to broader concerns in the financial community about the likelihood of Ethereum ETF approvals in the near term.\n\nAnalysts from JP Morgan have estimated the chances of approval by the May deadline at no more than 50%.\n\nIn contrast, GSR\u2019s analyst Brian Rudick has notably reduced the probability to 20% from an initially optimistic 75%.\n\nIndustry Reaction to Delays\n\nThe ongoing delays and rigorous scrutiny from the SEC have sparked significant commentary among industry specialists.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a final nudge to try and get the SEC\u2019s attention, although most likely in vain,\u201d said ETF specialist Eric Balchunas, highlighting a general sense of pessimism that has persisted since the initial campaigns for cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nBenzinga's Future Of Digital Assets Event\n\nAs discussions and developments around Ethereum ETFs continue to unfold, they will undoubtedly be a topic of focus at Benzinga\u2019s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Apologizes, DOJ Pushes For 3-Year Sentence\n\nImage: Shutterstock"
