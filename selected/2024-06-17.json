        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLeading Ethereum developer Consensys announced late Tuesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is \u201cclosing its investigation\u201d into the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0,\u201d the company posted on Twitter. \u201cThis means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC approved Ethereum spot ETFs last month, Consensys said it sent a letter to the SEC noting that the funds \u201cwere premised on ETH being a commodity,\u201d asking how the decision would affect the agency's investigation. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC. Today we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0. This means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsensys attorney Laura Brookover separately posted the SEC's notification letter and the company's full statement on the SEC's move to Twitter.\n\n\u201cThings have changed remarkably fast since we filed our lawsuit against the SEC in late April, culminating in today\u2019s development,\u201d Brookover wrote. \u201cAfter more than a year, the Ethereum investigation is finally over with no charges against anyone.\u201d\n\nThe SEC sent us a closing letter in the Ethereum 2.0 investigation today. Things have changed remarkably fast since we filed our lawsuit against the SEC in late April, culminating in today\u2019s development. After more than a year, the Ethereum investigation is finally over with no\u2026 \u2014 Laura Brookover (@laurabrooksie1) June 19, 2024\n\nThe SEC's correspondence, however, included standard language that disclaimed that the notice that it concluded its investigation \u201cmust in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen contacted by Decrypt, an SEC spokesperson said \u201cthe SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\u201d\n\nIn April, Consensys went on the offensive, filing a lawsuit against the SEC that claimed the regulator was trying to \u201cseize control over the future of cryptocurrency\" and that it was planning to designate Ethereum as a security. In fact, the unredacted lawsuit revealed, Consensys alleged that the SEC had internally decided on the status of Ethereum a year prior.\n\nThe lawsuit was triggered by a Wells Notice\u2014a precursor to regulatory action\u2014Consensys said it received for its popular MetaMask wallet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Consensys made clear that it would continue to press its case against the SEC.\n\n\u201cIn our lawsuit, we also seek a declaration that offering the user interface software MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate the securities laws,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt should not take a lawsuit to provide the much-needed regulatory clarity to allow an industry that serves as the backbone to countless new technologies and innovations to thrive.\u201d\n\nWhile celebrating the SEC's decision to back off, the company remained staunchly critical of the agency's approach to crypto regulation.\n\n\u201cThe closing of the Ethereum investigation is momentous, but it\u2019s not a cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under SEC\u2019s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime,\u201d Consensys added."
