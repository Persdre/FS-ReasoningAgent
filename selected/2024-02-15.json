        "content": "Advertisement\n\nTim Beiko, a prominent figure within the Ethereum ecosystem, took to X to relay significant updates from the latest All Core Devs Execution (ACDE) call, focusing on the progress of various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nAmong the discussed topics, EIP-2935 stood out, gaining renewed interest thanks to the potential integration of Verkle trees.\n\nThese social media updates offered a glimpse into the Ethereum community's ongoing efforts to enhance the network's efficiency and security, particularly highlighting the strides being made toward improving stateless client support and refining the execution layer (EL) state transition function.\n\nStateless client support\n\nBeiko's posts detailed the discussions around EIP-2935, aimed at improving the verification process of historical block hashes to bolster stateless clients' operational trustworthiness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis proposal, along with its adjustments to accommodate the latest fork activation schemes and the Verkle roadmap, represents a crucial step towards reducing the network's trust assumptions.\n\nMoreover, the community's exploration of adopting an architecture similar to EIP-4788, which employs a ring buffer for historical data storage, demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving technical challenges and enhancing Ethereum's foundational infrastructure.\n\nFuture outlook and security concerns\n\nThrough his X thread, Beiko also brought to light concerns regarding potential exploits that could arise from the use of contracts designed to overload the network with computational demands.\n\nThis issue, particularly relevant with the shift to more compute-intensive Verkle hashing, reflects a broader challenge that the Ethereum team is committed to investigating further.\n\nIn addition, the discussion extended to other pivotal EIPs, such as the PAY opcode (EIP-5920) and the reduction in the cost of transient storage (EIP-7609), which collectively aim to streamline transaction processes and fine-tune resource pricing for enhanced network performance."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRonin, a Ethereum sidechain designed for blockchain games, announced Thursday that it will reduce RON token rewards paid to liquidity providers on its Katana decentralized exchange (DEX) starting in March.\n\nSky Mavis, the company behind the network and its flagship game Axie Infinity, said that it plans to cut liquidity pool token emissions in multiple waves, slashing the daily token rewards by approximately 50% each time. Doing so will reduce the number of tokens being added to the circulating supply on a daily basis.\n\nThe network said that the average annual percentage rate (APR) for providing liquidity has jumped from around 20% to 70% in recent months. However, the amount of tokens pooled has not grown proportionally to match the increase in rewards.\n\n\"This means the increase in reward value did not drive meaningful outcomes in DEX liquidity provision, and may have gone past the optimal level of incentives,\" the announcement said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, rewards will be reduced in phases. The first phase, planned for March 1, will cut emissions by over 60,000 RON per day, or around 5.4 million RON per quarter. At the current price, that\u2019s a cut of more than $174,000 worth per day or $15.6 million worth each quarter.\n\nAdditional phases will continue reducing rewards over the course of 2024. The reduction aims to curb \"over-incentivization\" of liquidity providers and lead to better equilibrium for token prices, according to the network. It will also free up more of the RON token supply for other initiatives that could drive user growth.\n\nThe market reacted positively to the news, as the price of RON jumped shortly after the announcement, according to data from CoinGecko. Ronin is up 7% on the day to a current price of $2.90, pushing the token\u2019s 30-day gains to 56%. RON was just listed on major crypto exchange Binance earlier this month, which was cited as one of the reasons behind this rewards cut.\n\nThe network has seen a dramatic rise in active users over the last few months after the blockchain-based farming game Pixels migrated over from Polygon in October. Pixels will launch its own PIXEL token on February 19 after running a play-to-airdrop campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Almost 8,300 validators each with 32 ETH are currently waiting in line to begin staking, while 161 validators are trying to exit, a sign of continued interest in restaking.\n\nThe number of Ethereum validators waiting to enter the network is at its highest mark since the start of October.\n\nThe queue for validators to start securing the Ethereum network is significantly longer than the line for validators to relinquish their responsibilities of confirming blocks, a sign of interest in restaking, the practice of re-using ether (ETH) already securing the base layer of Ethereum in additional ways. The more validators that are securing the Ethereum blockchain, the more ETH is available to be restaked.\n\nThe enter queue is 51 times bigger than the exit queue at press time, according to data provided by blockchain explorer beaconcha.in. Nearly 8,300 validators each with 32 ETH are currently waiting in line to begin staking, while 161 validators are trying to exit.\n\nThe validator queue is a mechanism aimed at stabilizing Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus. If validators didn\u2019t have to wait, a huge and sudden influx of ETH could either enter or exit, causing an abrupt change in the security system for the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization.\n\nThe number of validators waiting to enter the network is at its highest mark since the start of October. At press time, the number of active validators \u2013 those currently securing the Ethereum blockchain and not waiting in the queue \u2013 exceeds 943,000.\n\n\u201cThe validator queue started to increase in the beginning of Feb, while the ETH staking yield is still below 4%. This [increase] coincides with EigenLayer\u2019s staking cap raise on 2/5,\u201d wrote Kelly Ye, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nARVE Error: src mismatch\n\nprovider: youtube\n\nurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxsVKw7SdAs&t=7s\n\n\n\nsrc: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs?start=7&feature=oembed\n\nsrc mod: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs?start=7\n\nsrc gen: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs\n\n\n\nError: src mismatch\n\nMore ETH Available to Be Restaked\n\nWith 32 ETH each, the roughly 8,300 validators will bring in about $746.3 million in total to secure Ethereum. Consequently, this also means that more ETH is available to be restaked.\n\nEigen Layer, the protocol widely known for its restaking technique that extends Ethereum\u2019s security to additional applications and networks, has been a popular destination for crypto denizens\u2019 liquid staking tokens (LST).\n\nPeople have been able to deposit their LSTs into EigenLayer, but the team placed caps on each LST pool. The team has temporarily lifted caps on the number of LSTs people can deposit into the protocol several times. The latest cap raise occurred on Feb. 5, which saw the value locked in EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts more than triple from $2.156 billion to nearly $7.034 billion in 10 days, data from DefiLlama shows.\n\nAs the number of validators entering the population outpaces those leaving, the rewards per validator will continue to shrink. Ethereum staking APR started at above 5% in June 2023 and has since decreased 129 basis points to nearly 3.8% at press time, according to data provided by beaconcha.in.\n\nHowever, Decentral\u2019s Ye noted that \u201cwe expect ETH staking interest to continue to grow as the staking theme continues to grow. ETH currently has about 32.5% staked, which is still lower than other big [proof-of-stake] chains.\u201d\n\nThe price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency for Ethereum, has increased 3.2% in the past 24 hours and 17.5% over the past seven days to trade at $2,851, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Tops $2,800, A Rally To $4,000 In The Making? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying at an impressive rate alongside its peer Bitcoin, which almost touched $53,000 on Thursday. Investors seem to be spoilt for choice, especially with altcoins making incredible strides. As discussed earlier today, investors are likely to start redistributing capital from Bitcoin profits into altcoins, propping tokens like ETH for a larger breakout targeting $4,000 in Q1.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: A Rally In The Making\n\nEthereum price bullish outlook comes amid impressive performance of Bitcoin ETFs which achieved a humongous cumulative net inflow of $4 billion on February 1.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInvestors perceive this surge as validation of Bitcoin and crypto from traditional investors. ETFs allow institutions to seek exposure to BTC without dealing with the complexities associated with navigating exchanges, owning physical digital and assets which require special custody services.\n\nAway from the BTC ETF, Ethereum is poised for a larger breakout due to the upcoming Dencun upgrade. All three testnet launches have been completed implying that developers will be announcing the final dates for the mainnet debut before the end of Q1.\n\nOptimism for a spot Ethereum ETF has also started to build. Following the approval of BTC ETFs, speculators turned to Ethereum as the next-in-line digital asset.\n\nThe approval of an Ether ETF, although a long shot at the moment, considering the hawkish stance of regulators in the US on whether Ethereum is a security or not, is expected to drive prices higher as witnessed with Bitcoin.\n\nAmid these expectations and potential market mover factors, Ethereum seeks a breakout above $2,800 to extend the leg to $3,000 and subsequently to $3,600 before the end of February.\n\nFor starters, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator backs the uptrend, displaying a buy signal and green histograms above the neutral area.\n\nIf interest in ETH continues this week, holding above $2,800 would signal confidence in the uptrend and possibly ignite FOMO among investors as they speculate on further price increases this week.\n\nSupport is expected at $2,700 on the downside. However, if profit-taking destabilises Ethereum price, traders may want to consider $2,500 and $2,200 as key support areas.\n\nBlockchain data by IntoTheBlock reveals that over 7.8 million Ethereum addresses are currently in profit, while 5.45 million addresses deal with unrealized losses.\n\nThe largest support area stands out at $2,365 \u2014 the average price at which 1.72 million wallets purchased slightly over 5 million ETH. Based on the chart below, Ethereum price has a higher chance of rallying to higher levels above $3,000 as opposed to dropping to January\u2019s support at $2,200.\n\nThat said, Ethereum could still be a steal if bought at the current market value. In case of dips to lower support areas, consider a dollar-cost average strategy to make the most out of the sublime bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.
