We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has found itself under the scrutiny of analysts as the digital asset hovers around crucial price levels. A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights, asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2,130, with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the latest market data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,262, reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days, showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours, reaching $9,626,210,522, indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.\n\n$ETH / $USD - Update\n\n\n\nThe ETH range is simple.

Reclaim the range high at $2,500 and we are really bullish pic.twitter.com/YKOph2YbRY \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 8, 2024\n\nCrypto Tony's emphasis on the $2,130 and $2,500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts, who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPotential bullish catalyst\n\nIn a related development, the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade , known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade. This imminent update has generated considerable buzz within the Ethereum community, as it promises substantial enhancements and alterations to the platform. The Prague upgrade is anticipated to introduce improvements in scalability , security and overall functionality, which could positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory.\n\nThe potential bullish effect of the Prague upgrade on ETH's value has sparked discussions among investors and analysts, with some speculating that the impending changes could serve as a catalyst for a price surge, propelling Ethereum above current levels.\n\nWhile the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, the confluence of technical analysis highlighting key price levels and the anticipation of a major network upgrade contributes to the growing intrigue surrounding Ethereum's future price movements. Market participants are closely monitoring the developments, ready to capitalize on potential opportunities as ETH navigates these crucial junctures in the ever-evolving crypto landscape."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Eruption Past $3k Imminent? Investors Unpack Vitalik \u2018s Bull Run Tips - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, a leading cryptocurrency, has been on an upward trajectory for the past few months. The cryptocurrency value has soared from under $2,000 to $2,400, indicating a positive trend. However, the current market displays mixed sentiments about its future direction. The digital currency has been fluctuating within a defined range, showing signs of both strength and uncertainty.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum price value has impressively hit $2,270, marking a 0.78% increase in just 24 hours. This rise suggests a positive market mood. The trading volume, according to data by CoinMarketCap, has also seen an 84% jump in the same period, reaching $509 million. With a market capitalization of $10 billion, Ethereum ranks second among cryptocurrencies.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum faces a consolidation phase, especially under the $2,400 mark. The leading smart contracts token has been oscillating between $2,100 and $2,400 in the past week, with bears and bulls struggling. In the past year, Ether experienced a significant increase of over 79%, demonstrating resilience and optimism as bullish sentiment prevails despite occasional minor dips.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Investment Tips for Ethereum Enthusiasts\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently shared some investment wisdom. This came after a noted blogger, Alexander Voigt, discussed how diversification aided Bill Gates in wealth accumulation. Buterin, however, termed Voigt\u2019s advice as subpar and offered his own financial guidelines.\n\nThis is awful advice. Some actual financial advice: * Diversification is good.\n\n* Save. Get to the point where you have enough to cover multiple years of expenses. Financial safety is freedom.\n\n* Be boring with most of your portfolio.\n\n* Don't use >2x leverage. Just don't. https://t.co/CIvDJcD3UG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 7, 2024\n\nButerin\u2019s tips are simple yet profound. He emphasizes the importance of diversification, suggesting that a varied portfolio can reduce risk. He advises investors to save enough to cover multiple years of expenses, stressing the value of financial safety and freedom. Buterin also recommends keeping the bulk of one\u2019s portfolio in stable investments and strongly advises against using more than 2x leverage.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly relevant for both new and seasoned investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Adhering to such prudent strategies could potentially pave the way for Ethereum\u2019s price to surge past the $3,000 mark. If the bullish trend persists, this milestone could soon be within reach.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Supporting a Bullish Outlook\n\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price movement adds another layer of optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently around the 50 mark, suggesting a balance in market momentum. On a 4-hour chart, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased since breaking above the 200-day moving average and exiting a major descending channel. This bullish trend is visually evident through the formation of three four-hour green candlesticks.\n\nMoreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line has overtaken the signal line, indicating a positive market outlook. The rising histogram supports this bullish sentiment. The 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on an upward curve, and the 50-day MA crossing over the 200-day MA reaffirms the bullish market sentiment. The Chaikin money flow indicator is also in the positive region at 0.04, indicating a bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC could approve the world's first spot Bitcoin ETF later this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.30%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (ETH 0.01%) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (MARA -1.31%) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could ascend to $50,000 if SEC greenlights spot BTC ETF.\n\nEthereum price readies for a possible 10% climb to $2,500 amid rising momentum and a weakening downtrend.\n\nRipple price finds support at $0.5442, recovery rally in the works as altcoin hopes rest on SEC decision.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains broadly bullish, though not to its full potential, as it could spring higher on chatter about regulator approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Altcoins, starting with Ethereum (ETH) price and Ripple (XRP) price, are also poised for a positive move, with all hopes pegged to the decision expected this week from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETF could see SEC greenlight, Grayscale Investments files amended S-3 sets 1.5% fee\n\nBitcoin eyes $50,000 amid spot ETF-related optimism\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to intertwine itself with the midline of the weekly supply zone at $43,860 but could break out soon as spot ETF developments approach a deadline. The king of cryptocurrency\u2019s price has strong support provided by the 25-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at $43,130 and $41,391, respectively. The inclination of these moving averages to the north show it is the path with the least resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also tipping north, showing rising momentum. Increased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price make a decisive move above the critical threshold of $43,860, before an extension to the next critical range at $48,000.\n\nOnce Bitcoin price overcomes the $48,000 steeple, it could make a quick run to the $50,000 psychological level before potential profit booking. However, traders keeping their profit appetite in check could set the pace for BTC to reach the highly ambitious target of $60,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if early profit booking commences, instigated either by a rejection from the SEC or a delay in the decision, Bitcoin price could descend. Such a move could see it break below the 25 and 50-day EMAs before testing the confluence between the 100-day EMA and the horizontal line near the $37,800 level.\n\nHowever, for the prevailing bullish outlook to be invalidated, Bitcoin price must close below the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast, Analyzing possible short-term implication of probable spot ETF approval on BTC price\n\nEthereum price coils up for a 10% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains within the confines of an ascending parallel channel, with the final retest of the lower boundary of the channel possibly precipitating a 10% climb to $2,500. The RSI is moving north, evidence of rising momentum, accentuated by the falling Average Directional Index (ADX), showing that the slump that saw ETH value drop is losing strength.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price shatter the $2,388 resistance, before clearing the $2,445 range high as it heads to the forecasted $2,500 target. A strong jolt past this level could see ETH market value reach $3,000.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if profit takers pull the trigger, Ethereum price could roll over, potentially losing the support at $2,135. Below this level, the cliff could send Ether to the depths of $2,000, or in a dire case, invalidate the bullish outlook by breaking and closing below $1,935.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price could target $3,000 with ETH whales buying the dip\n\nRipple price could scale a recovery with $0.5442 support holding\n\nRipple (XRP) price may have bottomed out after the $0.5442 support came into play. The RSI edging north points to rising momentum, whereas the ADX indicator rising suggests a strengthening trend.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see Ripple price overcome the critical support at $0.5784, potentially going as high as to breach the resistance due to the descending trendline and collecting sell-side liquidity around the $0.7000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders who got wrecked during the January 2 crash choose to exit the market after breaking even, XRP price could drop, with a break below the $0.5442 support exposing Ripple price to a cliff. This would expose further downside as low as the midline of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.5002. A break and close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price likely to bounce 20% as balance restores in the XRP market"
