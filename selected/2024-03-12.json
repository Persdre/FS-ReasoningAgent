        "content": "Technically known as a \"hard fork\" in blockchain terminology, it's expected to initiate around 13:55 UTC (9:55 a.m. ET). The upgrade is designed to usher in a new era of cheaper fees for the growing array of auxiliary networks that operate on top of Ethereum, called layer-2 (L2) \"rollups .\" Those changes will come with the activation of a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called \u201c proto-danksharding ,\u201d or EIP-4844, which is designed to improve the chain's ability to handle data from L2 networks."

SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous political challenges following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a court loss to Grayscale in August 2023 could also be factors in the SEC\u2019s current approach.\n\nEthereum traded at around US$3,970, at 3 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko."
