        "content": "CFTC Chair Reiterated to U.S. Senate that Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Commodities\n\nThe chief of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, has once again advocated for his agency to oversee Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, by classifying them as commodities. Speaking before the U.S. Senate Committee on July 9, Behnam referenced a recent Illinois court ruling that reinforces this classification.\n\nThe court decision on July 3 was part of a $120 million Ponzi scheme case involving an Oregon man accused of fraud. The Illinois district court judge declared that both Bitcoin and Ethereum qualify as commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act. The ruling also extended this classification to Olympus (OHM) and KlimaDAO (KLIMA).\n\nBehnam also cited a 2022 report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) that pointed out a regulatory gap in the spot market for digital assets that are not securities, suggesting that the CFTC should play a more significant role in overseeing digital commodities.\n\nBehnam emphasized that the lack of action from other U.S. regulators would not diminish public interest in digital assets and could potentially increase risks to financial markets and investors. \u201cIn short, our current trajectory is not sustainable. Federal legislation is urgently needed to create a pathway for a regulatory framework that will protect American investors and possibly the financial system from future risk,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe CFTC Chair outlined five key legislative priorities he believes his agency could implement to better regulate digital commodities. These priorities include crafting rules tailored to the unique risk profile of cryptocurrencies, establishing a permanent \u201cfee-for-service\u201d funding model, requiring comprehensive disclosure from registrants about their crypto assets, and enhancing the CFTC\u2019s Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) capabilities."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has just been freed from an aggressive sell-off by a top whale, spotted about a week ago. According to data from crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, the Ethereum whale, identified as the open-source decentralized computing platform the Golem Project, just staked 40,000 ETH. This staked fund is worth $124.6 million as of the time of staking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum freedom after intense Sell-off\n\nPer previously referenced posts by Lookonchain, the Golem Project started sending thousands of ETH to centralized exchanges on July 8. In the first wave of the sell-off, the protocol sent 24,400 ETH worth approximately $72 million to Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex.\n\nGolem Project was one of the foundational beneficiaries of Ethereum ICO as far back as 2016. At the time, the protocol raised 820,000 ETH when the price of the coin traded for just $10.2.\n\nWith the sell-off activated, this week, the outfit also moved another 4,600 ETH, valued at $14.1 million, to Binance and Bitfinex, as of July 9. On July 10, another 3,000 ETH deposit was made to Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase.\n\nThe staked Ethereum was also moved on July 10, and while many feared further selling off, the Golem Project decided to lock up the funds for now.\n\nPerfect timing\n\nEthereum is the second major cryptocurrency responsible for the broader market sell-off at the moment. While the spot Ethereum ETF sentiment is expected to sustain sentiment and price growth, the reversal is the case.\n\nIn the early stages, investors looked to the ETF as a major catalyst to drive growth and, hence, went all out to buy the coin. With Bitcoin losing its position in the industry, the ripple effect on Ethereum saw many HODLers offloading their bags.\n\nKnowing its sell-offs might trigger a market slump, the Golem Project decided to sell its bag at a time when the impact would be least felt."

        "title": "Ethereum rebounds, whales scoop ETH: Will the ETF approval boost gains? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum whales are actively accumulating, with recent large transactions signaling renewed confidence.\n\nAnticipation of Ethereum ETF approval drives significant institutional inflows, suggesting bullish sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price increase has triggered heightened activity among large holders, commonly known as whales.\n\nFollowing a week of downward momentum, ETH\u2019s price has seen a resurgence, leading to substantial transactions by whales.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,113.58 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14,340,649,075, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThis was reflected in a 1.07% price increase over the past 24 hours, although the cryptocurrency has experienced a -7.46% decline over the past seven days.\n\nThis uptick in price has catalyzed increased accumulation by whales, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment.\n\nSignificant whale movements\n\nRecent on-chain data indicated substantial activity among Ethereum whales.\n\nNotably, Spot On Chain, an on-chain data provider, reported that an Ethereum whale withdrew 16,449 ETH, equivalent to $50.3 million, from the crypto exchange Binance [BNB].\n\nThis move came as ETH surged past $3,000, marking the first notable accumulation by a new whale address. The withdrawn ETH has since been transferred to a new wallet and remains there.\n\nFurthermore, Whale Alert noted another substantial transaction involving 9,966 ETH, equivalent to approximately $30.6 million, transferred from the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet.\n\nThis activity aligned with a broader trend of whales resuming their accumulation of ETH following a period of distribution.\n\nAli, a known analyst on X, commented,\n\n\u201cAfter a brief distribution period, #Ethereum whales are back to accumulating $ETH!\u201d\n\nThe number of addresses holding over 10,000 ETH has declined since mid-April and began to rise again in early July.\n\nThis trend suggested that some mega-whales reduced their holdings during the price decline but are now increasing their positions.\n\nThe timing of these large-scale withdrawals and accumulations coincided with the market\u2019s anticipation of the Ethereum ETF, which is expected to go live next week.\n\nThis development is a potentially bullish signal for Ethereum, as it could attract further investment and drive up prices.\n\nPotential impact of Ethereum ETF approval\n\nKatherine Dowling, Bitwise\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer, has affirmed that the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. is approaching.\n\nWith issuers submitting their S-1 amendments, analysts expect the approval around the 18th of July.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nThis has led to a surge in inflows into Ethereum investment products, with institutional players accumulating ETH ahead of the ETF approval.\n\nLast week, Ethereum investment products saw inflows of $10.2 million, indicating growing interest from institutional investors."
