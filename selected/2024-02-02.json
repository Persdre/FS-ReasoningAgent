        "content": "A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader believes Ethereum (ETH) is on the verge of a massive breakout.\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 691,900 followers on the social media platform X that there are three main reasons why he believes ETH could soon soar by more than 70% from its current value.\n\nHe thinks the finalization of ETH\u2019s next major upgrade called Dencun will help boost the network\u2019s value. Dencun aims to decrease ETH\u2019s transaction costs for layer-2 projects and address scalability issues.\n\nOther catalysts, according to the trader, are the possibility of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for ETH and the funneling of Bitcoin (BTC) profits into ETH after the crypto king\u2019s April halving event, when miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half.\n\n\u201cEthereum is still ready for $3,500-4,000 in the coming three-six months.\n\nDencun upgrade with the final testnet February 7th.\n\nEthereum spot ETF hype.\n\nBitcoin rotation after halving towards the rest of the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the trader suggests Ethereum is printing a bullish pattern of higher low prices and is on the verge of possibly flipping the key level of $2,336 into support.\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,309 at time of writing.\n\nNext up, the trader predicts Bitcoin will rally up to $51,000 before the halving and then correct to the low $40,000 range.\n\n\u201cBitcoin consolidating and acting in a boring manner. Probably it will look for a higher low after which we\u2019re having a slight pre-halving push to $48,000-$51,000.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,357 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs reach $5.7 billion in AUM, Europe holds majority stake - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The market is dominated by Ethereum futures ETFs, with Canada and Europe shining, followed by Brazil and the US.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape is currently valued at $5.7 billion in total assets, with Europe holding an 81% majority share, according to a Feb. 2 report by CoinGecko. Leading the pack is XBT Ethereum Tracker One (COINETH) with assets amounting to almost $3.5 billion, making it the largest Ethereum ETF globally.\n\nIts counterpart, XBT Ethereum Tracker Euro (COINETHE), follows as the second largest, boasting $511 million in assets. Both ETFs, which are based on ETH futures, have been traded in Europe since their inception in October 2017, marking the world\u2019s introduction to ETH ETFs.\n\nIn Canada, the CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (ETHX) stands out with over $478 million in assets, while Europe\u2019s 21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP (AETH) holds the title for the second largest spot ETH ETF, with $329 million. Launched in 2019, AETH was the first of its kind worldwide.\n\nThus, the global ETH ETF market is largely concentrated in Canada and Europe, with the top 10 ETFs traded exclusively within these regions. The United States trails behind, with its highest-ranking ETH ETFs occupying 14th position or lower.\n\nThis gap is attributed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s hesitancy in approving spot ETH ETF applications, leaving room for speculation on whether the U.S. will be able to bridge this divide.\n\nOverall, Ethereum ETFs are present in 13 countries and traded across seven markets. Brazil emerges as the third-largest market, followed by the US, with smaller contributions from Hong Kong, Australia, and Malaysia. The distribution of ETF types varies by region, with Europe offering both futures and spot Ethereum ETFs, while other markets specialize in one or the other.\n\nGlobally, there are 27 active Ethereum ETFs, encompassing both spot and futures contracts. Despite the diversity of offerings, the market is dominated by a few key players, with the top 10 ETFs holding 96.4% of total assets. The landscape is skewed towards Ethereum futures ETFs, which account for 68.5% of the total assets, double that of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe proliferation of Ethereum ETFs saw significant growth during the crypto bull market of 2021, with 12 new launches across various regions. The trend continued, albeit at a slower pace, through 2022 and into 2023, with new ETFs emerging in markets including Malaysia, which introduced the Halogen Shariah Ethereum Fund (HALSETH) in 2024."

        "content": "For Ethereum to rise nearly 5 times in value by the year 2030, here's what needs to go right.\n\nSo far in 2024, Bitcoin (BTC -0.36%) has attracted much of the attention of crypto investors, thanks primarily to all the buzz surrounding the launch of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. But don't sleep on Ethereum (ETH -1.08%), which is finally showing signs of making a bull market breakout above the $2,000 price level.\n\nFor Ethereum to hit a future price of $10,000 would require it to rise nearly 5 times in value within a relatively short period of time. But there are several good reasons why that might be more likely than you think. Let's take a closer look.\n\nEthereum's market dominance\n\nWhile it might be fashionable to talk about all the upstart cryptos challenging Ethereum -- most notably Solana (SOL -0.80%) -- the fact remains that Ethereum still dominates in just about every key niche of the world of blockchain-based smart contracts.\n\nTake decentralized finance (DeFi), for example. According to the leading metric used to calculate DeFi strength (Total Value Locked, or TVL), Ethereum is the market leader by a wide margin. Ethereum currently accounts for 56% of all TVL in the blockchain world. By way of comparison, Solana's market share is less than 3%.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, Ethereum will continue this market dominance over the next five years. In doing so, it will position itself at the forefront of every major blockchain trend. Sure, some of these trends might flame out, as we saw recently with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and metaverse tokens. But some of these trends could really take off and create an enormous amount of value along the way.\n\nSpot ETF approval on the way\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming catalysts that could lead to a sustained rally in Ethereum's price. Chief among these is the potential introduction of a spot ETF product for Ethereum.\n\nThese new Ethereum ETFs are expected to galvanize the same type of market enthusiasm as the new Bitcoin ETFs. In fact, immediately after the spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading, the price of Ethereum spiked, largely based on this assumption. Right now, it looks like SEC approval of a spot Ethereum ETF could happen as early as May. Assuming that there are no market glitches related to the new Bitcoin ETFs, approval now looks likely.\n\nThe big question is what type of effect this approval might have on the price of Ethereum. The current assumption is that institutional investors will choose to allocate at least 1% of their portfolios to crypto. Presumably, the lion's share of that money would flow into Bitcoin. But some portion of that money would flow into Ethereum as well, and that could steadily push up the price of Ethereum over time.\n\nHow likely is the $10,000 price forecast?\n\nA price target of $10,000 by the year 2030 might sound outlandish, but it's actually more conservative than other price targets for Ethereum. If you look across the crypto industry, you can find price forecasts of $50,000 and higher for Ethereum. It all really depends on how fast you think Ethereum can grow over the next half-decade.\n\nFor example, in 2022, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest predicted that Ethereum would have a market cap of $20 trillion by the year 2030. Given Ethereum's current circulating coin supply of 120 million, that would imply a future price of approximately $170,000 per coin! Moreover, Wood has suggested that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the next crypto market rally and potentially even \"flip\" Bitcoin in terms of overall market cap.\n\nGranted, that $170,000 price prediction was made amid all the buzz and hoopla surrounding The Merge, which saw Ethereum radically overhaul its blockchain to prepare for the next wave of growth. But it gives you an idea of how high some investors think Ethereum could soar in the next few years.\n\nWhat needs to happen next\n\nFrom my perspective, a few things need to happen next in order for Ethereum to hit that magical $10,000 price point as early as the year 2030. For one, we need to see approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs. That would make Ethereum much more attractive to both retail and institutional investors. It would also be great to see Ethereum continue to make major upgrades to its blockchain, so that it becomes even faster, cheaper, and more efficient to use.\n\nThe only problem, really, is what to do about all those pesky Ethereum challengers. They appear to be growing faster than Ethereum and, in some cases, innovating much faster than Ethereum. Even Cathie Wood has acknowledged this.\n\nSo Ethereum reaching a price of $10,000 is by no means a slam dunk. Even in the best of all possible worlds, it takes many years of frankly unrealistic price gains to get there. But if the entire crypto industry continues to grow and mature, and if Ethereum maintains its dominant market role along the way, it just might happen."

        "title": "Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in August 2024 - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nAfter a rollercoaster 2023, things are looking up for the crypto market. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs from eleven different organisations, including heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity.The SEC approval has naturally got retail investors curious about cryptocurrencies. They are now asking: \"What do I invest in?\" This article delves into the ten most promising cryptocurrencies to invest in 2024. Established titans like Bitcoin and Ether are going to be portfolio mainstays. But rising stars like Solana and Injective are also vying for a piece of the digital future.Prepare yourself, as 2024 promises to be a profitable year for crypto investors.We take a look at the top coins and tokens to invest in 2024 below.The world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has the largest market capitalization. Its established network, limited supply, and growing institutional adoption make it a relatively safe haven in the volatile crypto market.Bitcoin grew by 155% from the start till the end of 2023. These returns are better than anything you'd get from investing in traditional financial assets, albeit at a slightly higher risk. With the impending ETF approval, halving, and potential rate cuts from the US Fed, Bitcoin is poised to reach greater heights in 2024.The go-to platform for smart contracts and dApps, Ethereum fuels the burgeoning field of decentralised finance (DeFi). Despite intense competition from other Layer 1 blockchains, many institutional investors rely on Ethereum owing to its security and mature ecosystem.Because of this interest from institutions, we feel it\u2019s an excellent asset for HODLing. The upcoming EIP-4844 proposal could reduce gas fees significantly on Layer 2 blockchains piggybacking on Ethereum. This would be another win for Ethereum and could further boost its value. Solana (SOL) Boasting lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has attracted a thriving ecosystem of DeFi and NFT projects. Its continued focus on scalability and developer experience makes it a strong contender in the high-performance blockchain space.According to data from crypto data provider CryptoSlam, NFT sales on the Solana blockchain ($366.5 million) exceeded those of Ethereum ($353.2 million) for the first time in December 2023. This strong interest in Solana from retail users. Cardano (ADA) Built with meticulous research, Cardano boasts a secure and scalable blockchain. Its focus on sustainability and smart contracts makes it a long-term player with a commitment to responsible growth.ADA is not just a speculative asset. People are exploring it for various real-world applications, including supply chain management, identity verification, and voting systems. These real-world use cases grant ADA value, making it a great addition to crypto portfolios. Polygon (MATIC) Polygon is a popular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, meaning it helps transactions on the Ethereum blockchain become significantly faster and cheaper.Other Layer-2 scaling solutions have emerged since Polygon's debut in October 2017, but it still stands tall as a popular option in DeFi. Several popular dApps like Uniswap, Curve, Chainlink, and more have integrated Polygon into their ecosystems.In the future, Polygon aims to offer its scaling solutions to other blockchains. It also plans to provide interoperability between different protocols and blockchains.Due to Polygon's successful track record and its goals to solve real-world problems, MATIC is an excellent coin to invest in.Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining popularity by challenging Ethereum with its lightning-fast transactions. In 2023, it grew by a whopping 254%, despite market ups and downs. The constant growth comes from its expanding ecosystem, new dApps, and partnerships. With low fees and scalability, it attracts users and developers looking for a faster and cheaper option than Ethereum.In the future, Avalanche aims at DeFi, NFTs, and business solutions. With a strong team and community, 2024 seems promising for AVAX. If it grabs a big share in DeFi and NFTs, AVAX could become a major player in the blockchain world. Polkadot (DOT) Think of Polkadot (DOT) as the Internet for Blockchains. It connects different blockchains, letting them share data and work together. This \u2018multichain\u2019 approach breaks down barriers and unlocks new possibilities.While 2023 wasn't a record growth year for DOT, its potential for the future is huge. Developers can build custom blockchains on Polkadot, making it ideal for everything from DeFi to healthcare.Plus, security is a top priority. Polkadot's central chain keeps everything safe and sound.With DeFi booming and NFTs making a comeback, Polkadot's interoperability could be key to their success.This Layer-1 blockchain caters to all sorts of DeFi applications, including decentralised exchanges (DEXs), prediction markets, and lending protocols \u2013 all on-chain and lightning-fast. Like Ethereum, it has excellent support for smart contracts.Injective provides plug-and-play modules that developers can use to build cutting-edge financial applications. Its token, INJ, fuels the platform, letting you vote on upgrades and potentially share in its growth.INJ's price skyrocketed towards the end of 2023, going from about $8 at the start of October to about $40 at the end of the year, a massive 5x growth! Overall, things are looking promising for Injective in 2024.Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralised exchange (DEX) where you can trade directly from your own wallet. Unlike a centralized exchange (CEX) like Binance, you keep complete control of your funds, so there's no risk of your assets being frozen.As a DEX, Uniswap also doesn't use the traditional order book model. Instead, it facilitates peer-to-peer exchange of tokens. This means that users can trade directly with each other, cutting out the middleman and reducing trading fees.UNI is the platform's native token, and it gives users a say in how Uniswap evolves. They can vote on proposed changes to the protocol, which can have a big impact on the platform's future. Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos is unique in that it's designed to connect several blockchains to communicate seamlessly.Its potential for mainstream adoption is high, making its native token (ATOM) a valuable addition to crypto portfolios in 2024.While you may invest in your preferred cryptocurrencies individually, a better approach is to invest in crypto as an index fund. And Mudrex's Coin Sets allow you to do just that.Coin Sets are curated collections of cryptocurrencies that are grouped based on themes or as index funds. You manage your risk better by investing in a basket of cryptocurrencies as opposed to hand-picking individual coins. Gains in other assets can offset a drawdown in an individual asset.As an example, take Mudrex's Crypto Blue Chip Coin Set . It's a crypto index fund that tracks the performance of the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. If you want broader exposure without having to rely on heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum, you might want to check out the Crypto Broad Market Index instead.Investing in cryptocurrencies requires careful consideration beyond mere hype. To make informed decisions about what to invest in, focus on these five key criteria:Dive deep into the blockchain technology underpinning the cryptocurrency. Assess its scalability, security, decentralization, and innovation potential. Are there unique mechanisms that address existing blockchain challenges? Does it offer interoperability with other platforms?Evaluating the technology helps gauge the cryptocurrency's potential for future growth and adoption.Scrutinize the team behind the project. Do they have relevant expertise and experience in blockchain development and business? Is their track record transparent and credible? Are they actively engaged with the community and responsive to feedback?A compelling use case is vital. Does cryptocurrency solve a real-world problem or offer a clear value proposition? How does it differentiate itself from existing solutions? Is there sustained demand for its functionality within its target market?If a cryptocurrency has a practical use case or two, it is more likely to succeed and have long-term value.Analyse the market demand and adoption rate for the cryptocurrency. Is there a growing user base and developer community? Are established institutions or businesses embracing its use? Has its trading volume and liquidity increased steadily?While past performance is not indicative of future results, historical price movements can offer valuable insights. Understand the factors driving both short- and long-term price fluctuations. Be wary of extreme volatility and sudden spikes, as they may suggest speculative hype rather than sustainable growth.By studying these five criteria, you can gain a deeper understanding of a cryptocurrency's potential and make informed investment decisions based on its individual strengths and weaknesses. Remember, thorough research, a diversified portfolio, and risk management are crucial in the world of crypto.Cryptocurrency investment presents both compelling opportunities and inherent risks. While the potential for high returns can be alluring, you must understand the risks of this new market. Below are some risks and considerations to think about before beginning your investing journey:Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies undergo significant price fluctuations. Rapid uptrends and equally swift downturns often characterise these fluctuations. For example, Bitcoin's price dropped by almost $3,000 on January 3, and no significant news that day could've caused it!This inherent volatility carries a substantial risk of loss. We can't emphasise the need for risk management and responsible investment strategies enough.India's regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies remains in flux. This is in spite of crypto investors filing taxes for the first time last fiscal year. This dynamic environment can give rise to disruptions and uncertainties, meaning you have to stay informed about evolving regulations and their potential impact on the market.Blockchain technology, while innovative, is still undergoing significant development. Technological imperfections, bugs, and vulnerabilities can lead to network disruptions, transaction delays, and even security breaches. These risks can jeopardize the value and functionality of invested assets.Where there's money to be made, there will always be malicious actors looking to exploit the gullible. And the world of cryptocurrencies isn't any different. Sophisticated phishing scams, fraudulent projects, pump and dump schemes, and unregulated exchanges pose significant threats to unwary investors.The year 2024 paints a vibrant picture for crypto enthusiasts. With the confluence of bullish signals like the Bitcoin ETF approval, Bitcoin halving, and potential Fed rate cuts, we might witness some explosive growth this year.This isn't a solo show for Bitcoin, though. Altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Uniswap are carving their own niches, fueled by innovative technology and robust ecosystems. Meanwhile, established platforms like Ethereum and Avalanche are constantly evolving, solidifying their positions as cornerstones of the DeFi and NFT landscapes."
