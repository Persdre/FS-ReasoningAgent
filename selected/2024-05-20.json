        "title": "Ethereum Price Surges Above $3K Mark Amidst Unforeseen Court Ruling - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Surges Above $3K Mark Amidst Unforeseen Court Ruling\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a notable price rally over the past 7 days, with a 5.36% increase that brought its price close to the $3,100 level. Analysts attributed this surge to stalling retail sales data in the United States for April, raising expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth.\n\nETH's surge was also influenced by a court ruling and a U.S. Department of Justice indictment. The indictment, unsealed on May 15, accused two individuals of wire fraud and money laundering through the manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain. The court document emphasized that Ethereum operates as a decentralized blockchain without the need for a trusted intermediary, boosting confidence among ETH investors.\n\nThis came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice to Robinhood, a trading platform, over alleged securities violations related to crypto listings and custodian operations. The verdict contradicted regulators' classification of ETH as a security, as it highlighted the absence of management or entrepreneurial efforts by others within the Ethereum network.\n\nThe U.S. SEC is expected to announce its final ruling on VanEck and ARK Invest\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF request on May 23 and May 24 respectively. While analysts predict approval odds below 35%, the case for classifying Ether as a security instrument has weakened, contributing to the rally above $3,050 on May 17."

        "content": "Bloomberg Analyst Raises Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Odds to 75%: Will Approvals Happen This Week?\n\nOn Monday, May 20th, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X, raising his chances of a spot ETF approval from 25% to 75%. Within an hour, the post received over one million views. Balchunas is regarded as one of the most trusted sources in the crypto ETF space after playing a role in news coverage of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were released in January 2024. The update from Balchunas made waves in the crypto markets, causing the price of ETH to skyrocket over 10% within minutes.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today ?\n\nIf you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nBalchunas said that he is \"hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on\" spot Ethereum ETF applications. The SEC has been largely quiet about Ethereum ETFs over the past several months, mainly looking to make a decision on whether ETH should be classified as security or a commodity. Because the SEC has been so quiet, many have taken it as negative for the chances of a spot ETH ETF approval. However, with a final deadline for multiple ETFs on May 23rd and 24th, there is seemingly pressure on the SEC to make decisions before the deadline.\n\nTo add more context to Balchunas' post, he alluded to another tweet from Nate Geraci, a crypto ETF expert. Geraci's tweet noted that the \"SEC must approve both the 19b-4s (exchange rule changes) & S-1s (registration statements) for ETFs to launch. Technically possible for SEC to approve 19b-4s & then slow play S-1s (esp given reported lack of engagement here).\"\n\nEssentially, the SEC could give a partial greenlight to the ETFs, giving them time to take a much closer look at S-1s, which would allow them to better vet the applications to see how compliant they would be. This seems to make the most sense, as the SEC has been in the midst of a large debate surrounding the ETFs that could take more time than previously thought to conclude.\n\nTrending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\nAnother point of context is that ARK and 21Shares recently amended their application to remove staking. The move was likely made in an attempt to make their application more appealing to the SEC. While removing staking is obviously a negative for the ETF, it could play a role in increasing the odds of approval.\n\nThe buzz that Balchnas is hearing must be significant. Less than a week ago, he posted saying that he believes the odds of a spot ETH ETF are \"slim to none\", but has since raised his prediction to 75%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe path of the Ethereum ETFs does share some similarities with the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as the SEC was largely quiet in the weeks and days leading up to the approval. While the situations are largely different, it does show that it is entirely possible that the SEC could approve spot ETH ETFs later this week despite relative silence from the SEC.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF would be a huge milestone for crypto adoption, allowing a whole cast of new investors to access the token and could potentially send ETH to new ATHs above the $4,900 level.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHow much Bitcoin did Michael Saylor says you need to become a millionaire?
