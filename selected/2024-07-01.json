        "content": "SEC Sues Ethereum Developer Consensys Over Alleged Unregistered Broker Activities\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against Ethereum software firm Consensys. The SEC's filing claims that since January 2023, Consensys has engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities via its crypto asset staking programs and acted as an unregistered broker through its MetaMask Staking service, allegedly collecting over $250 million in fees.\n\nIn April, Consensys preemptively sued the SEC after receiving notice of the agency's intention to sue over MetaMask\u2019s staking programs. The firm claimed that the SEC had secretly considered Ethereum to be a security for over a year and was quietly assembling a broader case against the crypto asset. Earlier this month, Consensys announced that it had been informed by the SEC that the regulator was closing its case against Ethereum, a development that was celebrated within the crypto industry.\n\nIn the SEC's lawsuit, the agency highlights Consensys's facilitation of ETH staking via third-party services like Lido and Rocket Pool through MetaMask. The SEC argues that these staking programs are offered and sold as investment contracts, and therefore, should be classified as securities.\n\nThis lawsuit emerges during a turbulent period for the SEC and crypto regulation. Earlier on Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority struck down the \"Chevron doctrine,\" a critical piece of American law that had allowed federal agencies, including the SEC, considerable latitude to interpret their regulatory powers. Consensys appeared to reference this Supreme Court decision, forcefully asserting that the SEC lacks the authority to regulate crypto products like MetaMask."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a whale from the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) era has reemerged after more than six months of inactivity.\n\nA wallet that participated in Ethereum's ICO in 2015 and acquired 254,900 ETH at an ICO price of $0.311 per token transferred 7,000 ETH, equivalent to $24.28 million, to the Kraken exchange today.\n\nThis transaction marks the end of a 209-day silence from this notable holder, who still retains a substantial 40,000 ETH valued at approximately $139.5 million.\n\nThis whale's movements have caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community\u2014not only due to the sheer size of the holdings but also because of the potential market implications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLarge transactions by such early adopters can influence market sentiment and price dynamics, especially when the transfer is to a significant exchange like Kraken. It\u2019s often (but not always) the case that someone transfers to an exchange because they\u2019re selling or preparing for further trading activity.\n\nSimultaneously, another significant transaction involving the U.S. government surfaced.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, one of the known U.S. government wallets transferred 3,375 ETH, worth about $11.75 million, to an unknown address, 0x5a...1871, earlier today.\n\nThis address is known to hold the seized funds of Estonian crypto entrepreneurs Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin, who were involved in a high-profile cryptocurrency fraud case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe transfer of such a considerable amount of ETH by a government-held address raises intriguing questions about the potential uses of these funds.\n\nThis move follows a previous transaction where another U.S. government address transferred 11.84 BTC to address 3KHnTq...muuso9, indicating a pattern of strategic fund management or liquidation by authorities.\n\nThe timing of this transfer has sparked speculation within the crypto community.\n\nSome analysts suggest it could be a sign of profit-taking, while others view it as a potential redistribution of assets or liquidity provision to the market.\n\nAs both private whales and government entities maneuver large sums of digital assets, the potential impacts on market liquidity, price stability, and overall sentiment are significant.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."
