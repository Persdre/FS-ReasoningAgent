        "content": "Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is reportedly \"optimistic\" about Ethereum ETF approval prospects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe head of the latest cryptocurrency asset manager expects the agency to do \"the right thing.\"\n\nAs reported by U.Today , Grayscale recently withdrew its Ethereum futures ETF application after it was delayed in November. According to ETF analyst James Seyffart, it was a Trojan horse filing that was meant to get a 19b-4 order from the SEC.\n\nHowever, according to multiple analysts, Grayscale's withdrawal likely means that it is not going to pursue another lawsuit against the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast August, Grayscale scored a massive victory against the agency, which eventually paved the way for the approval of a slew of Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nGrayscale's GBTC recently recorded its first days of inflows after months of non-stop bleeding.\n\nDespite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, the consensus appears to be that the SEC will shoot down several Ethereum ETF applications this March based on the complete lack of engagement with ETF issuers.\n\nRecently, key Ethereum backer Consensys, which is helmed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, took the SEC to court over its attempt to label the leading altcoin as a security.\n\nIn late April, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs started trading in Hong Kong, but their debut was rather underwhelming."

        "content": "Traders Increase Short Positions as Grayscale Withdraws Ethereum Futures ETF Application\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH) has been hovering near a crucial support level at $3,010, experiencing a 2.57% drop over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. During this time, traders have shown a growing belief that the price will continue to decline, as they have accumulated significant short positions.\n\nThis development comes after Grayscale Investments decided to withdraw its application for an Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 7, just ahead of the scheduled decision by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fate of spot Ether ETF applications, also set to be determined in May, has further fueled speculation regarding the classification of Ether as a security.\n\nLiquidation data indicates that if the price of Ether rises by 3%, approximately $345 million worth of short positions could be liquidated. In contrast, a 3% drop to $2,920 would only result in the liquidation of about $237 million in long positions.\n\nAnalysts and the crypto community have grown increasingly skeptical about the approval of a spot Ether ETF by the SEC. However, concerns about Ethereum extend beyond ETF approvals. The low usage of Ethereum has resulted in the challenge of its burn mechanism keeping up with issuance to validators. Furthermore, Ethereum has underperformed in comparison to Bitcoin, attributing it to a lag in speculative interest from short-term holders (STH)."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020 - Unchained",
        "content": "The low price of transacting is a result of the flight of activity away from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its layer 2 networks, particularly following the Dencun upgrade that occurred in March.\n\nThe average cost of a transaction on Ethereum is at its lowest level since Jan. 2020 (one gwei represents one-billionth of one ether and is the unit of ETH used to measure gas prices). The decline reflects the movement of activity from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its expansive array of Layer 2 solutions.\n\nMoreover, the release of the Dencun upgrade, which significantly reduced fees for those layer 2 networks, has only intensified this trend of lower transaction costs. Gas prices on Ethereum have decreased about 92% from about 63 gwei on March 12, the day before the upgrade, to around 5 gwei at presstime, data from blockchain explorer Etherscan and analytics investment platform Ycharts shows.\n\nAccording to layer 2 watchdog platform L2Beat, the number of active and upcoming L2 projects collectively stands at 95. Over the past several months, users have significantly increased the amount of crypto assets they\u2019ve bridged over to various layer 2 scaling rollups. And of the L2s, the top ones by total value locked\u2014namely, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base \u2013 have seen a spike in active daily addresses, signs of increasing user activity.\n\nRead More: Vitalik\u2019s New EIP-7702 Draws Early Support; Could Be Included in Ethereum\u2019s Next Hard Fork Upgrade\n\n\u201cWe can certainly see a trend upwards on EVM compatible chains of daily active addresses, which means users are going to cheaper alternatives. Looking at bridge data also confirms this, as bridge activity across Layer 2s has increased from ~$170mn per week to ~$300mn per week,\u201d Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Artemis, said in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has seen over $3 billion in net outflows of ETH over the past three months, per Artemis, with the majority of the flows going to L2s such as Arbitrum, zkSync, Base, Starknet, and Optimism.\n\nThe decrease in Ethereum\u2019s transaction costs is \u201ca reflection of the constant evolution of blockchain. Initially Ethereum served as the universal layer for all apps, from decentralized exchanges, to games, to trading memecoins, wrote Justin, CEO of decentralized perpetual futures platform Vest Exchange, in a Telegram message to Unchained. \u201cHowever, with the advent of Layer 2 solutions and app chains, builders and users (and MEV bots) are realizing that there are tailored ecosystems for specific use cases. In return, we also see Ethereum to be transitioning moreso as a foundational security layer and for supporting more \u2018passive\u2019 protocols such as lending and LSTs.\u201d\n\nEthereum Post-Dencun Upgrade\n\nDencun, the most recent Ethereum hard fork that brought several codebase changes, went live on mainnet on March 13.\n\nWhile the number of transactions has remained stable at just over one million per day, the amount of fees paid by end users of Ethereum has plummeted since Dencun, per Artemis.\n\nWith less overall transaction fees, the amount of ETH burned has gone down as well. According to Ethereum analytics platform Ultra Sound Money, the amount of ETH issued in the past thirty days is more than the amount of ETH burned, one outcome of the Dencun upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe new supply of ETH is now growing at the fastest daily rate since the Merge as fees burned plummeted as a consequence of the Dencun upgrade,\u201d analysts at blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant wrote in a report published on Wednesday.\n\nThe price of ETH reached a multi-year high of $4,000 on the day of Dencun, but has since dropped roughly 25% to around $3,015 at the time of publication, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, May 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues to offer diverse investment opportunities with unique growth potentials. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token (FURR) each present distinct scenarios, from SHIB's long-term aspirations to hit a significant price milestone, Ethereum's ongoing technological enhancements amid regulatory scrutiny, to Furrever Token's engaging community-driven initiatives. These developments highlight the varying strategies and market dynamics that investors and enthusiasts can navigate.\n\nShiba Inu's Road to $0.001: A Millionaire Maker for the Patient Investor\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), the cryptocurrency that captured the hearts of many young investors, continues to hold the community's attention despite its fluctuating market performance. Originating as a favorite among retail investors, SHIB has created significant wealth for its early backers, with some even reaching millionaire status. Although the token is currently far from its all-time high of $0.00008616 achieved in October 2021, the undying optimism among its supporters envisions a milestone price of $0.001 per SHIB.\n\nTo become a millionaire at this ambitious target price, an investor would need to hold approximately one billion SHIB tokens, currently valued at about $23,972. This significant number reflects not only the potential high reward but also the substantial risk associated with such an investment in the volatile crypto market.\n\nPredictions on when SHIB might reach the $0.001 mark vary, with forecasts suggesting a timeline between 2033 and 2040. Such a long horizon necessitates patience and enduring confidence in Shiba Inu\u2019s market strategy and broader adoption. The primary challenge facing SHIB is its massive circulating supply of 589 trillion coins, which poses a substantial barrier to significant price increases. Achieving a price of $0.001 with such a vast number of tokens would result in an unrealistically large market capitalization, not seen in current crypto valuations.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the SHIB development team is actively working on new mechanisms to reduce the token supply dramatically. Rumors suggest that these new initiatives could potentially burn trillions of tokens annually, accelerating SHIB\u2019s journey towards the $0.001 goal if successfully implemented. This strategy not only aims to enhance SHIB\u2019s value but also aligns with the community's long-term vision of reducing supply to create scarcity, thereby driving up the token's price.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those betting on SHIB, the path to becoming a millionaire is intertwined with the token\u2019s ability to overcome its supply challenges and achieve unprecedented growth in the coming years. This journey requires both a belief in the token\u2019s potential and the fortitude to withstand the ups and downs of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Positioned for Uptrend Amid Regulatory Developments and Technical Enhancements\n\nEthereum, a leading cryptocurrency, is showing potential for growth amidst a flurry of technical and regulatory developments. On a recent trading day, Ethereum's price was slightly down by 0.7%, trading around $3,013. However, signals of an upcoming rally are emerging, driven by significant improvements in its blockchain technology and speculative market movements.\n\nThe new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, developed by co-founder Vitalik Buterin and his team, is at the forefront of these developments. This proposal aims to innovate how externally owned accounts (EOAs) operate by allowing them to temporarily take on smart contract functionalities. This change is set to enhance the user experience significantly by simplifying gas fee processes, enabling transaction batching, and ensuring greater compatibility with the ERC-4337 smart contract wallet standard. These updates emphasize a shift toward making user-focused enhancements rather than purely technical scaling solutions, reaffirming Ethereum's commitment to its community of users.\n\nMoreover, the market is on edge as it awaits the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming decision regarding the Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application, expected on May 23. This decision is anticipated to cause volatility, with the community and investors closely watching for any potential impact on Ethereum's market position. Although current sentiments tend towards caution, historical trends and recent significant buying activities by large investors, commonly referred to as 'whales', suggest that Ethereum could be on the cusp of a significant upward movement. Should the market receive even slight bullish signals, Ethereum might break through the upper levels of its current price range, presenting a valuable buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nFurrever Token Stimulates Market Activity with $20,000 Competition Following Impressive Presale\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is gaining notable traction within the cryptocurrency sector by not only achieving over $1.1 million during its presale but also by initiating a lucrative buying competition. The newly announced \"Highest Total Buys Competition\" is set to distribute $20,000 worth of FURR among the top ten participants who invest the highest amounts over the course of the event. This competition is designed to further energize the Furrever community and stimulate market transactions for the FURR token.\n\nKicking off today, the 18-day competition promises generous rewards for the most active buyers. The participant with the highest total purchase will be awarded $5,000 in FURR tokens, with the second and third highest buyers receiving $4,000 and $3,000, respectively. Those who place fourth through tenth will each receive $1,000 in FURR tokens. This strategic move not only encourages community participation but also aims to enhance the liquidity and trading activity of the Furrever Token.\n\nPriced attractively at $0.000648 per token, Furrever Token presents an enticing investment opportunity with potential returns of up to 15X. The vibrant community backing the token is evident in its active Telegram group, which houses over 4,000 members. Here, investors and enthusiasts collaborate and exchange ideas, staying informed about the latest developments and strategic directions of the Furrever Token. This level of engagement and the exciting new competition underline the dynamic and promising future of the Furrever Token in the competitive cryptocurrency market.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.
