        "content": "The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is almost ready for the launch of its much anticipated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible sidechain, according to developers working on the project.\n\nThe project aims to allow Ethereum (ETH) developers, who are used to Solidity, the main programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum, to access and build on the XRPL network.\n\nDevelopment firm Peersyst Technologies says on the social media platform X that the new sidechain is waiting for a few components to come together, such as its XChainBridge which is currently being voted on by validators.\n\nThe bridge aims to allow users to automatically bridge any token from the sidechain onto the XRPL.\n\nPeersyst also says that the sidechain, which is \u201cmore advanced than ever\u201d and has already been audited by security firm Bishop Fox, is going through a second audit with \u201ca recognized supplier\u201d that will be published soon.\n\nThe firm also says that a new version of blockchain explorer Blockscout is being built for the sidechain.\n\nAccording to Ripple, some highlights of the EVM sidechain include:\n\nSupport for 1000 transactions per second, enabling large loads and throughput.\n\nLow transaction confirmation times, producing a block every 5 seconds.\n\n1 block finalization time; once a block is added to the chain and confirmed, it\u2019s considered final.\n\nFull Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, enabling you to connect your wallet and interact with or deploy smart contracts written in Solidity.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission delayed a decision on BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot ether ETF.\n\nThe delay pushes any decision on the proposed fund to March 10, according to an official release by the agency.\n\nThe delay was largely expected, with the SEC also delaying decisions on Fidelity\u2019s proposed fund on Jan. 18.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETF Delays will continue to happen sporadically over the next few months. Next date that matters is May 23rd,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe decision comes just weeks after the SEC approved nearly a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs. Three commissioners \u2014 Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda and Chair Gary Gensler \u2014 voted in favor of the ETFs.\n\nFollowing Grayscale\u2019s legal victory in August, the SEC was compelled to reevaluate its application for a spot bitcoin ETF conversion. Despite this progress, the status of ether ETFs continues to be unclear.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Peirce said that the SEC would \u201capply precedent\u201d to any decisions on spot ether ETFs. She further noted that the agency doesn\u2019t plan to repeat history and face another court case in order to approve such funds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath,\u201d Lara Crigger, editor-in-chief at VettaFi previously told Blockworks about ether ETF approval.\n\nHowever, Seyffart previously said that he was more bullish about the future of ether ETFs.\n\n\u201cIf [Gensler] goes after ETH, it\u2019s not just going to be a lot of these industry players; it will also be the CFTC that he has to contend with, and it\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d he told On the Margin podcast.The delay was largely expected after the SEC also delayed Fidelity\u2019s proposal\n\nIn his press release following bitcoin ETF approvals, Gensler noted that the decision \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Ethereum Wallet Holds $1.1M in MAGA Meme Coin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYou never know when a huge pile of meme coins can turn into serious cash. Early Dogecoin (DOGE) investors know this well, as do Solana developers who received an airdrop of BONK. And the latest beneficiary of a meme coin glow-up is\u2026 former U.S. president Donald Trump?\n\nAn Ethereum wallet that blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence previously tied to Trump, which holds a share of royalties from sales of the official Trump NFT collections, also holds over 579,000 MAGA (TRUMP) tokens. And a recent surge in price for the meme coins means that Trump\u2019s holdings are valued at about $1.1 million as of this writing, as first reported by CoinDesk.\n\nThe TRUMP token has jumped 222% this week alone, per data from CoinGecko, and 689% over the past 14 days. Meme coins are famously volatile and can be driven by social media sentiment and real-world events, and Trump has racked up a pair of 2024 presidential primary wins in recent days as he attempts to win a second term in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s wallet isn\u2019t associated with the creation of the TRUMP token, and in many cases, meme coins inspired by celebrities and public figures aren\u2019t created by the person in question. Instead, they\u2019re often created anonymously in an effort to ride the wave of hype and FOMO.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, Trump\u2019s wallet was sent the sizable allotment of TRUMP tokens across multiple transactions in August and October 2023, per public blockchain data tracked by Etherscan. At the time of the largest transfer, on August 19, the 469,901 tokens received on that date were collectively worth approximately $5,670, per data from DexScreener.\n\nNow his stash of TRUMP tokens is valued at $1.1 million, making up the largest single holding in the Trump-affiliated wallet. Overall, it holds nearly $2.6 million worth of cryptocurrency as of this writing, including about $755,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) and $731,000 worth of Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).\n\nIn December, the wallet dumped $2.4 million worth of ETH across a period of three weeks, following the launch of his third collection of NFTs minted on Ethereum scaling network Polygon. Only about half of the latest NFT collection has been minted so far, after the two previous collections both sold out.\n\nThe wallet was tied to Trump by Arkham last year following a financial disclosure notice from the former president, as the wallet receives royalties from the sale of his officially licensed NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "SEC has a \u2018hard no\u2019 stance on spot Ethereum ETFs, but issuers are optimistic: FOX reporter - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported a wide range of expectations regarding spot Ethereum ETF approvals on Jan. 23.\n\nNotably, Terrett suggested that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is opposed to approving a spot Ethereum ETF. She said:\n\n\u201cAnother source tells me the line at the SEC at this very moment is a \u2018hard no\u2019 and there\u2019s currently \u2018some internal resistance\u2019 to the idea.\u201d\n\nTerrett did not state whether that source is a member of the SEC itself or a member of an asset manager seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nTerrett also noted that SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-cryptocurrency stances, has advocated for a more straightforward decision process. The SEC in part approved spot Bitcoin ETFs because one applicant, Grayscale, obtained a legal victory, as SEC chair Gary Gensler explained in a statement. Peirce criticized that approach in an interview with crypto news platform Coinage today, as she said that ETF approvals should involve \u201cregular way consideration\u201d rather than court cases compelling action.\n\nTerrett concluded that further indications of the SEC\u2019s stance will emerge in the coming months as it becomes clear whether it engages with S-1 registration statements. The SEC typically posts notices of meetings with asset managers and exchanges on each ETF\u2019s page as they occur.\n\nAsset managers appear to be optimistic\n\nDespite resistance within the SEC, Terrett suggested that the asset managers responsible for issuing each fund are optimistic about approval.\n\nAccording to Terrett:\n\n\u201c[One] issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the approval and smooth launch of the Bitcoin spots will compel the [SEC] to approve ETH spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nAnother unnamed issuer said that they expect a spot Ethereum ETF to launch by the end of the summer because of the SEC\u2019s earlier approval of Ethereum futures ETFs, and because of BlackRock\u2019s strong ETF approval record.\n\nThat source also cited the CFTC comments suggesting Ethereum is a commodity, as well as Ripple\u2019s partial legal victory against the SEC, as factors that could more broadly prevent the SEC from labeling crypto assets as securities. However, it is not clear that those developments will directly impact spot Ethereum ETF approvals in the coming months.\n\nPublic expectations around approval vary. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posits a 70% chance that an spot Ethereum ETF will be approved in May, while JP Morgan executive Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has predicted a 50% chance of approval. Polymarket odds suggest a 53% chance of approval.\n\nMentioned in this article"
