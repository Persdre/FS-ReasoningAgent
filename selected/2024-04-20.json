        "content": "Ethereum revenues grew significantly in Q1 despite price volatility\n\nETH\u2019s price started to see green again as network growth fell\n\nEthereum [ETH] took a massive hit in terms of price over the last few days. However, it\u2019s worth looking at the bigger picture too, with the same revealing that Ethereum\u2019s network has been doing really well, despite the recent price fluctuations.\n\nEthereum had a very positive Q1. In fact, Ethereum achieved a profit of $370 million from $825 million in revenue, equating to a net income margin of approximately 45%.\n\nEthereum revenue on the rise\n\nIf Ethereum was listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, it would lead the net income margin (%) rankings, with Microsoft, Adobe, and Veeva following closely. In terms of total profits across all publicly traded software companies, Ethereum would rank sixth.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization stood at approximately $350 billion, placing it on par with tech giants such as Salesforce.\n\nHowever, there are significant caveats to consider here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s historical performance may not be as stellar, and its structure deviates from traditional corporations. Unlike a typical company, Ethereum\u2019s token functions as both a utility and a form of \u201cequity.\u201d Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s valuation is considerably higher than traditional software companies, when compared by revenue multiples.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nThe growth of Ethereum in Q1 and its potential for growth in the next quarter can help aid the bullish narrative around the network. Moreover, the revenue generated through L2s after the Dencun upgrade can also help the Ethereum network in terms of profitability.\n\nDespite all these favorable things happening for Ethereum, the price of ETH fell materially over the past week. It depreciated by over 11% and slipped past the $3,000-mark, before recovering again. However, the interest in ETH grew after this drastic decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that even though the price of ETH recovered, its network growth flatlined.\n\nThis indicated that the number of new addresses interacting with ETH fell. A lack of interest from new addresses in ETH could affect the price movement of the altcoin significantly going forward."

        "content": "Ethereum whale jumps on \u2018buy the dip\u2019 opportunity after Israel's attack on Iran.\n\nThe buyback yield of Ethereum exceeds that of major S&P 500 firms.\n\nEthereum may continue trading inside key range as investors await the market's response to Bitcoin halving.\n\nEthereum resumed its sideways movement on Friday after briefly crashing due to Israel's attack on Iran. The move presented a buying opportunity for a whale, who quickly profited from it. This also comes when Ethereum's buyback yield exceeds that of several S&P 500 firms.\n\nRead more: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nDaily digest market movers: Israel's retaliation, whale activity, buyback yields, Hong Kong's ETH ETF\n\nEthereum wasn't left out, as the entire crypto market took a hit on Friday following Israel's strike in retaliation to Iran's attack on April 13. Here are your key market movers:\n\nAs ETH dipped briefly on Friday, a whale jumped on the opportunity, spending 9.5 million USDT to buy 3,253 ETH at ~$ $2,925, according to crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain. However, ETH's price has quickly recovered, especially as Iranian officials have downplayed responding to the attack. As a result, the whale made nearly $625,000 in unrealized profit.\n\n\n\nEthereum is outshining major tech and financial giants in terms of buyback yields, according to Token Terminal. In a list of $200 billion+ finance and tech S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway, Ethereum ranks number 16, above Tesla and JPMorgan with a buyback yield of 0.23%.\n\n\n\nBuyback for Ethereum, in this case, is implemented through token burns that began after The Merge in 2022. The number one smart contract blockchain achieved this feat in only nine years compared to the median age of 44 years of other companies in the list.\n\nETH buyback yield\n\nAlso read: Ethereum moves sideways as Q1 report indicates token burns are making it deflationary\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expressed doubts that Mainland China investors may not get access to Hong Kong's spot ETH ETFs when they start trading. This pessimism is based on China's ban on all crypto-related activities in 2021. However, other analysts have pointed to Hong Kong's positive reception to crypto investment as a good sign that spot ETH ETFs would see impressive inflows when they launch in the region.\n\n\n\nDespite ETH's brief price decline, ETH's long liquidations weren't heavy, sitting around $34.4 million in the past 24 hours. This may be due to heavy liquidations already seen earlier in the week.\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue trading inside key range\n\nETH attempted to break the $2,852 support on Friday after Israel attacked Iran. However, prices have quickly bounced back, and ETH appears to be continuing its consolidation. The calm may be due to investors exercising caution as they await how the market responds to Bitcoin's fourth halving, which is a few hours away.\n\nRead more: Ethereum declines as crypto market crash increases bearish sentiment\n\nConsidering that many analysts have predicted that Bitcoin halving is already priced in, ETH may experience light volatility in the next few hours.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nBut in the coming weeks, it won't go outside the range of $2,852 and $3,406 formed in recent price movements, except if major external factors prevail on its price. In the long term, ETH could test the resistance of $3,730. An unlikely approval of spot ETH ETFs by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) would send it past the $4,000 key level to a new all-time high."
