        "title": "ARK Invest opts out of Ethereum spot ETF, explores alternative paths: Report - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The next step involves the SEC reviewing and providing feedback on the filings.\n\nShare this article\n\nSpot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen several developments this week following listing approval on May 23. The most remarkable is that Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest suspended its spot Ethereum ETF plans. An ARK spokesperson stated in an email that the firm would seek better investor opportunities.\n\n\u201cAt this time, ARK will not be moving forward with an Ethereum ETF,\u201d the spokesperson stated. \u201cWe will continue evaluating efficient ways to provide our investors with exposure to this innovative technology in a way that unlocks its full benefits.\u201d\n\nThe comments follow 21Shares\u2019s updated S-1 form for its Ethereum product, which no longer names ARK Invest as the ETF\u2019s partner. The proposed ETF has also been changed from \u201cArk 21Shares Ethereum ETF\u201d to \u201c21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.\u201d\n\nARK Invest cooperated with 21Shares in pursuing a regulatory nod to launch a spot Bitcoin fund. The two asset management firms expanded their partnership, applying to offer spot Ethereum ETF in September last year. At the time, the SEC\u2019s decision on spot Bitcoin ETFs was still on hold.\n\nAfter getting the SEC\u2019s approval in January, their spot Bitcoin ETF, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), debuted trading on the CBOE on January 11. As of May 31, ARKB holds around $3.2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nWhile Ark shelves its Ethereum ETF plans for now, the company affirms its continued commitment to its Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201c21Shares and ARK remain committed partners on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, which launched in January, as well as on our existing lineup of futures products,\u201d 21Shares confirmed in a statement.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF filings: Weekly roundup\n\nThis week\u2019s highlight is the updated S-1 forms from ETF issuers. At press time, all eight issuers had submitted their required filings to the SEC.\n\nThe S-1 amendment from VanEck was filed on the day of approval. BlackRock followed suit with an updated filing earlier this week. Other issuers also sent their amended filings by Friday, the due date set by the SEC.\n\nHashdex\u2019s proposed Ethereum ETF was withdrawn on May 24, one day after the SEC greenlit the other eight funds, except for Hashdex\u2019s. Hashdex was also the only issuer without an amended 19b-4 filing ahead of the Ethereum ETF decision.\n\nFidelity is the only issuer that discloses its management fee in its updated filing. Its planned fee is 0.19%.\n\nThe next step involves the SEC reviewing and providing feedback on the filings. According to a source with knowledge of the situation, this process could entail at least two additional rounds of revisions to the S-1 documents."

However, there is more analytics data showing that overall Ethereum sentiment is growing bullish quickly in the market now.\n\nWhale ETH accumulation speeds up\n\nIntoTheBlock shared that large cryptocurrency holders have begun to buy more ETH and do it more frequently, intensifying accumulation.\n\nAccording to the data it shared, at the moment, approximately 41% of the circulating Ethereum supply is owned by wallets each holding more than 1% of the ETH supply. This is a 36% increase from 36%, which was noted by the on-chain data collector at the start of the year.

This trend highlights increasing confidence among large holders. pic.twitter.com/GEvADO13k5 \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) May 31, 2024\n\nThe recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seems to be the largest driver of the increased ETH accumulation by whales. The final decision of the SEC regulatory body is expected to come later in June once the commission makes a scheduled meeting.\n\nThe Ethereum ETFs were approved following the positive decision of the SEC regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs announced by its chairman Gary Gensler in the middle of January. The approval of Ethereum funds came much faster than that of Bitcoin-based ETFs. The latter took the regulator almost a year, with the applicants making various required updates to their applications.\n\nIt was the same with the Ethereum products \u2014 the ETF applicants removed the ETH staking option from their applications.\n\nBullish ETH forecast versus Bitcoin thanks to Mt. Gox\n\nChinese crypto blogger and journalist Colin Wu has shared a message from the Telegram channel of QCP Capital. The trading company published a bearish outlook on Bitcoin and a bullish one of Ethereum in light of the massive BTC payouts planned by the embattled early crypto exchange Mt. Gox to its creditors later this year.\n\nQCP: Bearish BTC - potential supply from Mt. Gox distribution (~$9.6b) and also from DMM hack (~$305m). Bullish ETH - ETH spot ETFs could start trading earlier than expected in June with the SEC urging applicants to submit S-1 forms by 31 May. A sleepy market may get caught\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 1, 2024\n\nSince a massive amount of Bitcoin (worth almost $10 billion) is going to be injected into the market, QCP is largely bullish on Ethereum in the wake of the approaching spot Ethereum ETFs approval in June. The applicants were supposed to file S-1 forms by May 31 already."

        "title": "Spot ETH ETFs without staking miss the mark - Blockworks",
        "content": "While the recent approval of the spot bitcoin ETF in the US marks a positive step towards the institutionalization of the digital asset industry, the imminent approval of spot ether ETFs raises some concerns.\n\nThese ETFs do not offer staking rewards to investors (unlike European ether crypto ETPs), reflecting a lack of understanding by regulators and certain traditional finance asset managers of the key features that distinguish ether from bitcoin.\n\nDespite both being leading cryptocurrencies, ETH and BTC differ significantly in their functionality and role within the blockchain ecosystem. It\u2019s therefore essential for the industry and regulators to tailor financial products to their specific characteristics, benefiting both investors and the underlying networks.\n\nUnderstanding staking and Ethereum 2.0\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of ether ETFs, it\u2019s important to understand what staking entails and why it is integral to Ethereum\u2019s project.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model with the launch of Ethereum 2.0 in September 2020.\n\nStaking involves locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to support the network\u2019s operations, such as block validation, network security and governance. In return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of staking, consider that over 32 million ETH is currently locked up for staking. This represents 27% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply. At current prices, this equates to more than $121 billion. This significant portion of ETH being staked underscores the critical role staking plays in securing and maintaining the Ethereum network.\n\nBTC vs ETH: Different natures, different functions, different benefits\n\nTo fully appreciate the significance of staking in Ethereum, it\u2019s important to understand the fundamental differences between ETH and BTC. While both are leading cryptocurrencies, they serve different purposes and have different technological underpinnings.\n\nBitcoin is primarily designed as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange. Its blockchain operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which relies on miners to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nMoreover, bitcoin\u2019s supply is predetermined, and the issuance rate of new bitcoins is halved approximately every four years. This predictable supply schedule further enhances its appeal as a deflationary asset, in stark contrast to the unpredictable monetary policies governing traditional currencies. These characteristics make bitcoin a unique and attractive asset for investors seeking to hedge against inflation, benefit from its potential decorrelation with traditional financial assets and diversify their portfolios.\n\nGiven these attributes, it makes a lot of sense to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. As a digital commodity, bitcoin provides specific benefits for an investor portfolio, similar to those of gold but with the added advantages of digital assets. Our CoinShares Research demonstrates that including just 4% of bitcoin in a traditional 40/60 portfolio significantly enhances its performance. This improved the quality of diversification and potential for higher returns underscore the value of integrating bitcoin into mainstream investment vehicles like ETFs.\n\nEther, on the other hand, is much more than a digital currency. The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized, Turing-complete platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps). ETH serves multiple roles, from facilitating transactions to staking and securing the network.\n\nIn addition to these roles, ETH plays a critical role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3.\n\nWeb3, the potential next evolution of the internet, aims to create a decentralized web where users have control over their data and digital identities. Ethereum is at the forefront of this movement, providing the infrastructure for dapps that give users ownership and governance over their digital interactions. NFTs, which represent unique digital assets, are another significant innovation enabled by Ethereum. They could revolutionize digital art, collectibles and virtual goods, creating new economic models and markets.\n\nGiven Ethereum\u2019s versatile nature as a platform that facilitates network usage, dapps, DeFi and NFTs, it raises questions about the relevance of launching a spot ETH ETF without a staking feature.\n\nWithout staking rewards, a spot ETH ETF fails to fully leverage the unique advantages that Ethereum offers, both as an investment and a foundational technology for the future of decentralized applications and digital finance.\n\nThe benefits of staking ETH ETFs for investors\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons for including staking in an Ethereum ETF is the potential for additional returns through staking rewards.\n\nWhen investors stake their ETH, they earn a percentage of newly created ETH as a reward, significantly enhancing the overall return on investment (ROI) compared to simply holding ETH in a non-staking ETF. The annual percentage yield (APY) for staking ether typically ranges between 1% and 4%, which is attractive to investors seeking both capital appreciation and income generation.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ether ETFs are the wrong solution to the right problem\n\nBy staking ether, investors are directly contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. This alignment of interests ensures that stakeholders are incentivized to act in the network\u2019s best interests, promoting a healthier and more secure ecosystem. This, in turn, can enhance the value of their holdings, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and security.\n\nAdditionally, staking-enabled ETH ETFs can foster a more informed and educated investor base. Engaging in staking helps investors better understand the different types of blockchain and stay updated with the evolution of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe inclusion of staking rewards in an ether ETF can lead to significantly higher total returns compared to a non-staking ETF. Staking can also help mitigate some of the inherent volatility associated with cryptocurrencies by providing a steady stream of income.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the daily volatility of ether can exceed the annualized staking reward, meaning the notion that staking provides a cushion against price swings might be perceived as somewhat far-fetched. Nevertheless, this regular income can still offer a more predictable return profile, which is particularly important for institutional investors who may be more risk-averse and seek steady income streams in addition to capital appreciation.\n\nStaking-enabled ETFs encourage greater investor engagement with the Ethereum network. By participating in staking, investors are not just passive holders but active contributors to the network\u2019s security and governance. This deeper level of involvement can foster a stronger, more informed investor community, ultimately benefiting the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nRegulatory considerations and challenges\n\nThe primary concern for regulators with staking ETH is the security and custody of staked assets.\n\nEnsuring that staked ETH is safely and transparently managed is crucial for gaining regulatory approval and investor trust. Fortunately, the staking and custody ecosystem for Ethereum is now well-developed, with robust solutions in place to address these concerns. This maturity in infrastructure and technology ensures that investors can participate in staking with confidence, knowing their assets are secure and well-managed.\n\nAdditionally, there are fund structure considerations that present significant hurdles. For example, the US SEC has shown itself unwilling to allow staking in the traditional spot ETF structures. This is further complicated by the fact that the spot ETF structure (a 1933 Act grantor trust) generally does not hold securities. Because regulators in the US could consider staking a securities activity, this complicates the inclusion of staking rewards in the currently contemplated US spot ETF structure. Navigating these regulatory and structural challenges is essential to bring a staking-enabled ether ETF to market successfully.\n\nMoreover, the tax implications of staking rewards need to be clearly defined.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, staking rewards are considered taxable income, which could complicate the tax reporting process for ETF investors. Clear guidance from regulatory bodies will be essential to address these concerns and facilitate the adoption of staking-enabled ETFs. Additionally, depending on how staking is integrated into the product, it could generate additional revenue for the IRS, which is a positive aspect for the government to consider.\n\nBut the overall case for staking-enabled ether ETFs is compelling.\n\nBy integrating staking into the ETF structure, investors can enjoy additional income through staking rewards, benefit from compounding growth and contribute to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. This alignment of interests between investors and the network fosters a healthier, more secure, informed, and sustainable ecosystem.\n\nWithout the inclusion of staking, a spot ETH ETF may struggle to attract investors, who might instead opt for crypto-native solutions which already offer staking and network participation.\n\nJean-Marie Mognetti is Chief Executive Officer of CoinShares, a publicly listed investment firm that manages over five billion in digital assets on behalf of a global investor base, and an experienced commodities trader with a background in quantitative strategies.
