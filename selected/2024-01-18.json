        "content": "Macro investor Raoul Pal is predicting \"life-changing wealth creation\" in the crypto space over the next few years.\n\n\"This crypto opportunity is literally the perfect macro opportunity of a lifetime,\" he said Thursday. \"It's a very high probabilistic outcome that the next two years make life-changing money.\"\n\nYounger investors, particularly those burdened with student debt or unable to afford property, have a unique chance to improve their financial standing, he says.\n\nPal's advice:\n\nAvoiding FOMO (fear of missing out)\n\nSteering clear of leverage\n\nFocus on major assets like Bitcoin BTC/USD , Ethereum ETH/USD , and Solana SOL/USD\n\n, , and Be wary of exposing your portfolio to high-risk ventures.\n\nBitcoin ETFs \u2014 'A Pivotal Moment': Pal described the Bitcoin ETF launch as a pivotal moment, akin to a \"go rodeo\" scenario, characterized by chaos and humor, typical of the crypto world.\n\n\"It's a total shitshow, nobody knows what's going on. Everybody's laughing. Everybody's memeing the whole thing,\" he said in an interview with YouTuber Jamie Tree, capturing the essence of the crypto community's response to the event.\n\nThis launch, according to Pal, signified a major shift where traditional financial entities are stepping into a domain previously dominated by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nDespite the high trading volumes witnessed during the launch, Pal pointed out an unexpected market response.\n\nMany hedge funds had been buying into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC at a discount and hedging their bets, he says. But with the ETF's introduction, these dynamics shifted, leading to a sell-off in Bitcoin.\n\n\"So there's little selling of Bitcoin that was coming out of that. So there might have been $1 billion of selling that came out of that,\" Pal adds.\n\nDiscussing future inflows, Pal projects a bullish scenario for the Bitcoin ETF, estimating around 50 billion dollars in inflows for the year.\n\nRead Also: Binance's Market Share Among Crypto Exchanges Slides As OKX, ByBit Chip Away At Its Dominance\n\nEthereum ETFs: Regarding Ethereum ETFs, he gave a 70-75% chance of approval by August, citing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's likely strategy to integrate major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin into the traditional financial system.\n\nPal wasn't taken aback by Ethereum's surge following the Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nHe drew parallels with the late 1990s public market, where early-stage investors and ETF companies had been selling products in advance, leading to significant market churn upon actual launch.\n\n\"The new volumes come in, people taking stuff off. So there's lots of churn,\" he said, explaining the post-launch market dynamics.\n\nPal's \"Everything Code\" thesis, known for its accuracy in predicting market movements, was a significant topic of discussion.\n\n\"The everything code just says liquidity in, I buy it, you make money. That's it,\" Pal summarized.\n\nThis approach, focusing on liquidity as a primary driver of asset prices, has enabled him to anticipate trends and make successful investment decisions in the volatile crypto market.\n\nRead Next: Sam Bankman-Fried's Mom And Dad Want FTX Lawsuit Dropped, Deny Wrongdoing"

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETFs: The Race Is On - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nThe bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race is on for 2024.\n\nA 24% performance differential divides the popular crypto investments, as futures-based Ethereum ETFs are up nearly 15% and the new spot bitcoin ETFs are down 9% in their first three days of trading through Jan. 16.\n\nOver that brief period, $1.2 billion has flowed from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while $740 million has flowed into new spot ETFs like the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), meaning that almost $2billion has gone into the non-GBTC spot bitcoin ETFs this year. The heavy flows and trading volume partially explain the negative performance for spot bitcoin ETFs thus far.\n\nInvestors Eye SEC Approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum appears to be gaining a similar kind of investor enthusiasm as Bitcoin did in 2023, as multiple issuers, including the ETF behemoth BlackRock, Inc., have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. The timetable for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Ethereum ETF takes us to May 2024, which could lead to the bidding up of Ethereum prices in the coming months.\n\nAlthough the 2024 spot bitcoin versus Ethereum ETF race has only just begun, the story is setting up as the more established cryptocurrency versus the rising outsider.\n\nGBTC Outflows Impact Spot Bitcoin ETF Pricing\n\nDigging a bit deeper into spot bitcoin\u2019s poor start, $1.2 billion flowing out of GBTC pumped significant liquidity into the bitcoin ecosystem. The higher supply offset the early demand; thus, the price did not leap higher as many expected. The SEC announcement also appeared to become a \u201csell the news\u201d event.\n\nBTC\u2019s price rose more than 21% from late November through Jan. 8, peaking near $47,000 according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko data, as signs suggested increasingly that the SEC would approve at least a few of the filings (the agency approved all 11 applications). A primary reason for GBTC\u2019s huge outflows is likely its expense ratio of 1.50%, which is more than 100 basis points higher than any of the other 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on the market. Another reason is that GBTC had previously been a closed-end bitcoin trust with $29 billion in assets, and the SEC allowed it to convert to a spot bitcoin ETF last week as the new spot ETFs launched.\n\nGBTC\u2019s conversion enabled investors to sell shares. They had likely been waiting to exit the closed-end fund once they were longer locked in. Many investors bought GBTC at a discount in 2023, which was as low as 50%. and sold at par to capture gains after the conversion.\n\nClosed-end funds can be less liquid than ETFs, which are open-ended funds. The limited number of shares outstanding can result in wider bid-ask spreads and reduced liquidity for CEFs. If there aren't enough buyers, a closed-end fund can trade at a discount.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Spot Bitcoin vs Ethereum ETF Race?\n\nInvestors will likely be eyeing the bitcoin halving in April. The halving will cut the reward for bitcoin miners from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin, reducing the number of tokens entering the system. Observers of the digital asset space widely expect the event to boost BTC\u2019s price and bring more assets into spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin miners are lynchpins of the blockchain, helping to ensure its integrity. A month later, the SEC will decide on multiple applications for Ethereum ETFs, which could increase the price of ether, the token of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.
