(Memecoins are still the best performers over the past week.)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) traded flat while ether (ETH), still more than 20% below its all-time high, slipped 2.3% to below $3,800.\n\nOn-chain mail\n\nAll eyes are on Ethereum after bitcoin briefly hit all-time highs earlier this week \u2014 as a subset of validators pull their ETH from the chain.\n\nThere were slightly more validators exiting the Ethereum blockchain than joining yesterday, a first since late January.\n\nTotal ETH staked dropped by more than 2% overnight, or more than 670,000 ETH ($2.54 billion).\n\nEthereum\u2019s staking APR has risen from below 3.5% to 3.69% since the start of the month.\n\nStill, ETH staking has exploded over the past year, from about 15% of the supply to as much as 26% earlier this week (now back to just above one quarter).\n\nAbout 40% of all ETH staked (12.16 million ETH worth $46.2 billion) is with liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool \u2014 up from 10.84 million ETH at the start of the year (under 38% of total ETH stake).\n\nNew restaking apps like EigenLayer allow users to unlock additional rewards on their staking tokens. The amount of ETH in EigenLayer has popped 75% since January, from 1.7 million ETH to almost 3 million ETH right now.\n\nThere\u2019s 4.3 million ETH ($16.25 billion) in restaking apps overall, about 14% of the total ETH stake and over one-third of what\u2019s in liquid staking platforms.\n\nEigenLayer has sent users almost 2.4 billion points to date, part of an incentive system for future airdrops.\n\nThose points are selling for more than $0.15 per unit on Whales Market, effectively valuing the EigenLayer points market at nearly $360 million.\n\nThe ETH supply staked is more volatile since prices went up (source)\n\nCrypto business\n\nStocks across the crypto space found their footing Wednesday alongside bitcoin.\n\nBitfury-owned miner Cipher Mining surged more than 27% and held onto most of those gains after hours, propelled by strong Q4 earnings.\n\nMicroStrategy rallied 18.5% throughout the day \u2014 rounding out a 160% pump over the past month.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s surge came in response to its upsizing of a fresh convertible debt offering, from $600 million to $700 million (you guessed it \u2014 it plans to buy more bitcoin with it).\n\nMicroStrategy is up more than 100% on its bitcoin to date.\n\nThe firm already has $2.6 billion in liabilities after multiple rounds of corporate bond sales going back to 2021.\n\nTotal common shares outstanding for MSTR has nearly doubled across that period, from 7.623 million shares in December 2020 to 14.904 million at the end of last year.\n\nNot that markets seem to mind, MSTR\u2019s share price is up 750% since then.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s common share count has grown 38% since it went public in April 2021.\n\nCOIN has meanwhile swelled its cash pile from $4 billion to $5.71 billion per its latest disclosure.\n\nOn the ground\n\nLoading Tweet..

        "title": "Two-thirds of EVM smart contract deployments in 2024 are from Optimism: Report - Blockworks",
        "content": "A Flipside Crypto report shows that over 637 million Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts have been deployed across seven layer-2 blockchains since January 2022.\n\nEVM-compatible smart contracts refer to software that the computing state of the Ethereum blockchain can understand.\n\nWith scaling solutions becoming more efficient and accessible, fewer EVM contracts are directly deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. With the Dencun update around the corner \u2014 which will introduce blob transactions and other infrastructure upgrades \u2014 this trend is likely to accelerate.\n\n\u201cWith layer-2s able to only publish critical data to ETH layer-1, the costs for interacting with layer-2s should significantly decrease. This enables much more creativity in protocol development, a much easier experience for users to have complex transactions abstracted away from them and ultimately lowers the costs for layer-2s to interoperate with each other,\u201d Carlos Mercado, a data scientist at Flipside Crypto told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Ethereum devs debate future of account abstraction\n\nLeading this movement today is Optimism, an Ethereum optimistic rollup layer-2, which currently stands out as the most popular blockchain for deployments, accounting for over two-thirds (~70%) of the total EVM smart contract deployments so far this year. According to Flipside Crypto, the chain has seen over 28.8 million EVM deployments since Jan.1.\n\nHowever, for non-EVM smart contracts, Polygon and BNB smart chains (BSC) remain the most popular deployment chains. On Sept. 6 of last year, BSC saw 5.3 million contracts deployed, the most deployments seen on a chain ever, though this number quickly trailed off around Sept. 13.\n\nDeFi contracts on the rise\n\nDeFi smart contracts have been the most popular for developers across all chains this year, accounting for roughly 34.7% of all deployments that can be \u201ccategorized.\u201d This number is roughly 11.2% higher than in 2022 and 2023.\n\nBy contracts, NFT smart contracts, which drove the bull market between 2021 and 2022, have become less popular over time. Deployments decreased from 18.6% to 8.2% in the same period.\n\nRead more: Stellar sparks smart contract upgrade \u2014 and it\u2019s not an EVM\n\nMercado notes that this can be interpreted as both positive and negative.\n\n\u201cThe positive argument is that the space is finding product market fit, there\u2019s more tokens than ever and new primitives that enable lending, borrowing, options, perpetuals, oracles for more assets than ever,\u201d Mercado said.\n\nHe adds, \u201cthe somewhat negative argument is that given more money [is] flowing to more blockspace, fragmentation of liquidity is forcing more (arguably unproductive) activity: bridging and swapping for arbitrage as opposed to individuals\u2019 specific desire to be on a chain or have a token.\u201d\n\nMercado acknowledges both sides of the argument but notes his bias towards the space evolving faster than it is fragmenting.\n\nRead more: zkLink\u2019s Nexus wants to solve liquidity fragmentation between ZK ecosystems\n\n\u201cOther\u201d smart contracts\n\nUncategorized smart contracts, or those classified as \u201cother\u201d by Flipside Crypto, are by far the most commonly deployed smart contracts. They make up 93.8% of all smart contracts deployed across the observed chains.\n\nThis number is significantly higher than it was in 2022, where these smart contracts made up an estimated 37% of deployed contracts. It\u2019s also a little higher than in 2023, where these smart contracts made up around 86% of all deployments.\n\n\u201cWhile it is difficult to draw clear conclusions from this wide-ranging category, this figure, coupled with the growing proportion of dapps across all chains, suggests more experimentation and diversification at the protocol level,\u201d Flipside Crypto wrote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
