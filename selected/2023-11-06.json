        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto market was hot over the weekend.\n\nCryptocurrencies had a great weekend and are off on the right foot on Monday as well. Economic news last week gave investors reason to move further out on the risk curve, and that meant in part bidding up the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThree of the biggest movers were Ethereum (ETH 1.11%), Dogecoin (DOGE 7.30%), and Shiba Inu (SHIB 13.68%). Ethereum rose as much as 5.4% between Friday's close and noon ET on Monday and is now up 4.8% over that time. Dogecoin had a more pronounced move, climbing 10.2% and currently trading 9.1% higher. Shiba Inu is at its high point, up 7.1%.\n\nEconomic data driving markets\n\nThe economic news last week helped push markets, including cryptocurrencies, higher to end the week. Investors saw the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes as a positive and there was a lot of speculation that rates would be kept flat through the end of the year.\n\nOn top of that, a weaker-than-expected jobs report was seen as a positive for markets. As the thinking goes, if job growth is slowing, the economy may not be overheating -- which means the Federal Reserve will stop raising rates to slow the economy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but lower interest rates are currently seen as very bullish for riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. And short term, that's driving values higher.\n\nETF speculation continues\n\nTrading momentum continues to be strong on speculation that more crypto ETFs will be approved. We know the SEC is considering multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and that could pave the way for both more crypto ETFs and more funds flowing into the industry more broadly.\n\nBlackRock is one of the leading institutions applying for a spot ETF. The company controls $9 trillion in assets under management, so it could lead to a big inflow of funds to the crypto industry. That's the speculation.\n\nMany institutions have shied away from crypto because of the legal grey area it operates in, especially in the U.S. So, approval by the SEC would be generally bullish for crypto broadly at a time when many countries are writing specific rules on how cryptocurrencies can be traded and how blockchain companies can operate.\n\nWhile the market is speculating that a Bitcoin ETF would eventually be bullish for tokens like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, it's not clear if they would eventually get spot ETFs as well.\n\nSpeculation rules the day\n\nThe reality is that everything I discussed above is speculation about the value of cryptocurrencies. There's no increased utility or ability to pay for goods using the blockchain. Investors are simply bidding up digital assets because of what the Federal Reserve did and what they think the SEC might do.\n\nIf any of this speculation ends up being false, it's possible that crypto values could crash again. I would like to see more real world utility being built into the blockchain and tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu find real use cases. Until they do, this is just a speculative asset.\n\nEthereum still has the potential to be a valuable blockchain, but it also struggles with high costs and slow transactions. Upgrades could change that, but that will take time. Investors seem to be glossing over that utility need today."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Amid a vigorous bull market that stretched from November 2022 through April 2023, the Ethereum coin entered a consolidation phase, characterized by the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. This chart setup is formed to recuperate exhausted bullish momentum before the buyers take the leap. Coinciding with the market\u2019s current recovery mood, the ETH price gave a decisive breakout from the upper boundary of this pattern on November 5th. This breakout hints at the potential for a substantial rally in the near term.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Under Pressure As $400 Million Of Open Interest Wiped Out\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2000?\n\nA flag pattern is often spotted at an established uptrend offering buyers a temporary break before the next rally\n\nA bullish breakout from the chart set ETH price for a potential 22% jump\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $8.6 Billion, indicating a 22% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe bullish flag on the Ethereum price chart has been clearly defined over seven months, with the coin\u2019s price oscillating between the pattern\u2019s converging trendlines.\n\nNotably, this altcoin price has bounced off the pattern\u2019s upper boundary twice and its lower boundary four times, demonstrating its strong influence on the market\u2019s psyche. The last bounce from the lower boundary occurred on October 13th, sparking a 25% rally to the present price of $1911.\n\nThis upward movement was accompanied by a decisive break of the resistance trendline, signaling a potential conclusion to the correction trend. Currently, with a modest 1% daily gain, the ETH price is positioned favorably after the resistance breakout, poised to target the $2340 mark, which would represent a 24% upside.\n\nFurthermore, the projection from the flag\u2019s pole hints that the climb could extend toward the significant $3000 mark.\n\n1 ETH to USD = $2656.323 0.95% (24h) ETH btc\n\nbtc eth\n\neth xrp\n\nxrp bnb\n\nbnb sol\n\nsol ltc\n\nltc polygon\n\npolygon cardano\n\ncardano tron\n\ntron doge\n\ndoge WETH\n\nWETH LUNC\n\nLUNC XMR\n\nXMR LIRA\n\nLIRA BITS\n\nBITS IHINU\n\nIHINU SWEAT\n\nSWEAT PI\n\nPI SATS\n\nSATS ILV\n\nILV BDX\n\nBDX MCOIN USD USD\n\nUSD INR\n\nINR JPY\n\nJPY CNY\n\nCNY GBP\n\nGBP EUR\n\nETH vs SOL Performance\n\nSource: Coingape| Ethereum Vs Solana Price\n\nThe last three months\u2019 price period accentuates that Solana price recovery has outperformed the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum.

        "content": "Bitcoin price uptrend may be exhausted for the short term, as the $35,500 level pressures BTC.\n\nEthereum price at crossroads below $1,935 mean threshold represents a make-or-break moment for the largest altcoin by market capitalization.\n\nRipple price\u2019s bullish momentum continues to build, but the supply barrier ahead may pose a challenge with $0.800 likely to hold.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating below $35,500 for almost two weeks now, being static, with analysts attributing the slow-down in pace to the absence of ETF-related news. With its Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices have also come to a halt, facing critical barriers that will determine the next move.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains\n\nBitcoin price marks time below $35,954\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is marking time below the $35,954 level after a steady 40% climb that began in mid-September. Exchanging hands for $35,091 as of press time, the rally seems exhausted, with the price showing reluctance around the $35,500 level. The bulls are likely to take a breather as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position shows BTC is massively overbought.\n\nWith this outlook, it is likely that Bitcoin price could correct soon, likely for the short term, before a continuation of the primary trend. Likely targets in a downward directional bias include the $32,000 psychological level, a critical juncture having capped the upside potential for the king of cryptocurrencies since May 2022 when the Terra (UST) ecosystem fell off a cliff.\n\nThe RSI deviated from the northbound move, flattening to show complacency as buying pressure continues to weaken. This observation favors the downside.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, if sidelined investors join the bull\u2019s camp, Bitcoin price could continue north, breaking past the $35,954 resistance level with a breakout objective above the $40,000 psychological level. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate for BTC to test the supply zone extending from $44,321 to $47,122, with the $48,000 handle presenting the next logical target, a level last seen in March 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Holders of $600 billion worth of BTC are asking for Bitcoin price to rally not by 15% but by 96%\n\nEthereum price on collision with $1,035 mean threshold\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s 22% uptrend that started on October 13 has the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization confronting a crucial barrier \u2013 the $1,935 mean threshold of a supply zone extending from $1,861 to $2,004.\n\nIf Ethereum price records a daily candlestick close above the $1,935 midline, it would confirm the continuation of the uptrend, setting the tone for a successful foray above the $2,000 psychological level, with $2,029 as the next logical target.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA rejection from the $1,935 level could send Ethereum price spiraling south, potentially slipping below the $1,800 psychological level and testing the $1,748 support. Such a move would denote an 8% drop below current prices.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum net exchange deposits hits five-month peak with almost 130,000 ETH flowing to exchanges\n\nRipple price eyes 10% more gains\n\nRipple (XRP) price continues northbound, with robust higher highs and higher lows surpassing key barricades. Despite XRP being massively overbought, the primary trajectory of the RSI is still northbound, showing that momentum is still rising.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ripple price test the supply zone extending from $0.7771 to $0.8199. For a confirmed uptrend, the price must break and close above the $0.8000 psychological level, with the move likely to catalyze an extension to the $0.9000 psychological level, 25% above the current price.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with XRP being massively overbought, it is likely that the supply zone will hold as a resistance order block. The ensuing rejection could see Ripple price pull south, slipping through the $0.6968 support level and testing the $0.6242 support with bulls seeking rejuvenation. Another evaluation will be required at this point to determine the next step for XRP, considering the prevailing bullish outlook in the broader market.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"
