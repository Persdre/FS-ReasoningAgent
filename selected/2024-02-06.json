        "content": "The asset managers filed for an Ether spot ETF with the SEC in September last year.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested public comments on a proposed rule change to list and trade an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) from investment firms Galaxy Digital and Invesco, according to a filing published today.\n\nThe ETF, called the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, aims to track the spot price of Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nThe SEC published the proposal in the Federal Register on November 8, 2023, and has now instituted proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the listing.\n\nIn its proposal, the SEC outlined several areas where it is seeking feedback, including whether the ETF is properly filed under the Exchange\u2019s rules for commodity-based trust shares, and whether arguments made for listing Bitcoin ETFs apply equally well to an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\n\u201cDo commenters agree that arguments to support the listing of Bitcoin ETPs apply equally to the Shares? Are there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d the SEC queried in its request.\n\nThe regulator also asked for views on whether the proposed ETF would be susceptible to manipulation given the nature of the Ethereum market.\n\nOther questions covered topics like the liquidity and transparency of Ether markets, potential surveillance-sharing agreements with trading platforms like Coinbase, and the correlation between Ether spot and futures prices.\n\nInterested parties have until February 27, 2024, to submit comments on the proposed rule change. The SEC will then review the feedback as it decides whether to greenlight Galaxy and Invesco\u2019s Ethereum ETF."

These coins appeal to users seeking enhanced confidentiality in their financial transactions.Some governments are exploring or developing their own digital currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by the central bank.
