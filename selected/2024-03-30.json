        "title": "Surging Ethereum Whale Transactions Hint At Upcoming ETH Price Rally - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has registered a strong bounceback gaining nearly 15% over the last ten days from the lows of $3,000. As of press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.1% up at a crucial juncture of $3,510 with a market cap of 4421 billion.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulating In Big Numbers\n\nIn recent insights shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, amidst the observed correction in Ethereum\u2019s price over the preceding weeks, there\u2019s a noteworthy surge in whale transactions involving ETH. This trend is viewed as a bullish indicator, hinting at potential upward movements in Ethereum\u2019s price in the foreseeable future.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts have been expecting the Ethereum price rally to continue to $4,000 and further to hit its all-time high of $5,000 by the year-end. On the other hand, there have been mixed opinions regarding the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF with big players like Bitwise staying optimistic about the SEC approval by mid-May 2024.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nEthereum initiated a downward correction, dipping below the $3,550 mark. After retesting the $3,450 support level, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s movement, bullish momentum emerged. The price formed a low near $3,459 before rebounding.\n\nA notable development occurred with a breach above the $3,520 resistance area. Bulls propelled the price above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward swing from the $3,680 peak to the $3,459 low. Additionally, the ETH price broke a crucial bearish trend line, marked by resistance at $3,540 on the ETH/USD hourly chart.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading above $3,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Looking ahead, immediate resistance looms near the $3,600 level, with the first major obstacle residing at around $3,630. This level coincides with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move from the $3,680 peak to the $3,459 low.\n\nOn the upside, the next major resistance is at $3,680, crossing which will open the gates for a further rally to $4,000. On the downside, the first major support is at $3,480 dropping under which could open further gates at the $3,250 level.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "MetaMask's parent company ConsenSys urges SEC to approve Ethereum spot ETF - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "According to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum would be much more expensive and time-consuming than Bitcoin\n\nShare this article\n\nConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask, has submitted a public comment letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), advocating for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The letter highlights the robust security features of Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, specifically addressing concerns about potential fraud and manipulation within the network.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for public comments , issued on March 8, seeks insights into whether Ethereum\u2019s PoS could present unique security challenges. ConsenSys responded with a comprehensive argument, asserting that Ethereum\u2019s PoS surpasses the security benchmarks established by Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW), which has already been the basis for approved Bitcoin-based ETFs.\n\nAccording to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum is more expensive than attacking Bitcoin. Plus, an attack on Ethereum would also be much slower. Researchers estimate it could take nearly six months to gain control of the network, while an attack on Bitcoin potentially happens faster.\n\n\u201cThe total cost to attack on Ethereum would be nearly $34.39 billion (at December 2023 ether prices), and it would take nearly six months.20 The total cost to attack on Bitcoin, consisting mostly of the cost of computer hardware and electricity, would range from just under $5 billion to a little over $20 billion and could be waged more or less immediately. This makes Ethereum significantly more costly to attack than Bitcoin for the particular scenario addressed by the researchers,\u201d wrote ConsenSys.\n\nConsenSys additionally outlined several key advantages of Ethereum\u2019s PoS, including faster block finality, a distributed and randomized validation process, higher network attack costs, and slashing penalties for validators who breach protocol rules. These features, combined with Ethereum\u2019s environmental efficiency and transparent, decentralized community, provide a strong case for the network\u2019s resilience against fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe letter concludes with a call to the SEC to acknowledge the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed those of Bitcoin-based ETPs.\n\n\u201cThere is no justifiable reason to deny the listing and trading of the iShares Ethereum Trust based on concerns over ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation. We urge the Commission to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs previously approved by the Commission,\u201d stated ConsenSys.\n\nLast month, Coinbase sent a comment letter to the SEC in support of spot Ethereum ETFs . Coinbase\u2019s main claim in the letter is that Ethereum (ETH) is not a security and that Ethereum\u2019s PoS system effectively manages the network and mitigates risks. The firm also cited the recent approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs as a strong precedent for approving a similar product for Ethereum."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nConsensys, a prominent player in the blockchain and Web3 software space, has submitted a compelling argument to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging it to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design and grant approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsensys' argument for Ethereum ETF approval\n\nIn their comment letter to the SEC, Consensys addresses concerns raised by the Commission regarding Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the potential for fraud and manipulation.\n\nIn Consensys\u2019 response to the regulatory body, it maintains that the SEC's scrutiny and concerns are \u201cwholly without merit\u201d given that Bitcoin-based ETFs have already been approved for trading by the SEC. They maintain that the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation mechanisms present in Ethereum's PoS are more robust and surpass the resilience of Bitcoin's PoW consensus model against tampering.\n\nThe comment letter highlighted key reasons the SEC should go ahead and grant approval. Consensys insisted that Ethereum's transition to PoS enables provable transaction finality, ensuring that blocks are irreversibly confirmed in a shorter time frame compared to PoW systems.\n\nIts PoS model involves segregated roles for block validators, which prevents concentrated control. This, it claims, mitigates the risk of manipulation and adds an extra layer of security. The other consideration about its classification was also addressed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who believes that an Ether-based spot ETF could still be launched even if Ethereum ends up being labeled a security.\n\nContrasting Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance with Bitcoin's\n\nThe Web3 software company says Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is higher than Bitcoin's. It asserts that Ethereum\u2019s mechanism of penalizing validators who violate protocol rules by slashing their stakes serves as a deterrent against malicious behavior. Additionally, Ethereum's PoS model is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than Bitcoin's PoW.\n\nConsensys makes a passionate appeal to the regulatory body ahead of the possible approval by stating, \u201cWe urge the SEC to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs that have previously been approved by the SEC.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Ethereum ETF is being constantly delayed by the SEC, stakeholders anticipate a decision in the coming months. Regardless, Ethereum continues to gain traction as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a price of $3,502.43."

        "title": "Why Major Cryptocurrencies Soared This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "From strong bitcoin ETF inflows to anticipation of next month's bitcoin halving event, major cryptocurrencies continued their multimonth run higher this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies rallied this week amid multiple potential catalysts including strong net inflows into bitcoin ETFs, notable new registration filings for spot Ether ETFs, and an anticipated \"bitcoin halving\" event in early April.\n\nWhen all was said and done as of the close of Friday's regular session, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -2.01%) was up 9.7% on the week, while Ethereum (ETH -2.25%) had gained 5.1%. So-called memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE -6.36%) and Shiba Inu (SHIB -8.22%) also soared 41.2% and 16.5%, respectively, this week.\n\nOn Bitcoin ETF inflows, new spot ETH ETF filings\n\nThe price of Bitcoin eclipsed $71,000 several times this week -- a week after falling below $63,000 -- before settling to trade around $69,500 as of this writing. The world's most prominent cryptocurrency was bolstered in part by huge net inflows into bitcoin ETFs exceeding $243.4 million on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB 1.50%) singlehandedly registered net inflows of $200.7 million, becoming the third bitcoin ETF to cross the $200 million mark since the the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 13 bitcoin ETFs back in January.\n\nBitcoin, for its part, has enjoyed an incredible rally dating back to October 2023, which came after months of speculation after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nFor perspective, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through nearly any online brokerage -- as opposed to requiring investors to set up separate crypto trading accounts with a crypto-specific firm. So ETFs are a much more accessible medium for anyone who wants to put their money to work in cryptocurrencies. The SEC's approvals have stood out vote of confidence from a government agency in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment option.\n\nSome investors have also speculated more recently that Etherium ETF approvals could be on the way in the coming months, further bolstering crypto investment options for retail traders. On Wednesday, Fidelity Investments filed a Form S-1 Registration statement for its own spot ETH ETF. Asset Management firm Bitwise followed suit with its own registration statement filing for a similar spot Ether ETF on Thursday.\n\nOn the bitcoin halving event\n\nMeanwhile, crypto investors are eagerly awaiting a so-called bitcoin halving event scheduled for mid-April -- the fourth such event in bitcoin's history, with previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 -- where bitcoin miners' reward for solving complex transactions is effectively cut in half to limit the rate at which new bitcoin are introduced into the system until the maximum of 21 million bitcoins have been issued. Bitcoin's price has previously skyrocketed following each of the first three bitcoin halving events, so investors have naturally speculated a similar rally could occur next month.\n\nThe halving event is similar in some ways to a stock split, where a company may reduce its per-share price but commensurately increase the number of shares issued. Splits are a zero-sum event, of course, considering the value of the underlying business remains the same. But many retail investors tend to believe the lower post-split stock price is more attractive. Multiple cryptocurrency market pundits have argued that this halving event should further spur adoption of bitcoin while also limiting supply -- effectively keeping the price of bitcoin high.\n\n\"The halving reminds people that the supply of bitcoin is truly limited and that demand is increasing, driving up the price of bitcoin in the long term,\" Azteco Chief Marketing Officer David Bailey wrote this week. \"As something becomes more valuable, more people will want to use it, and so the cycle continues.\"\n\nThere are no guarantees, of course, that the price of bitcoin will rally on the heels of this halving in the near term. But it's hardly surprising to see crypto traders embracing the positivity leading up to the event."
