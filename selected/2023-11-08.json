Uniswap traders led the charge by driving 13.3% of burned ETH, followed by simple token transfers with 6%, and the Tether stablecoin protocol with 5%.\n\nBanana Gun, a Telegram trading bot, also made up a significant share of on-chain activity, pushing 3.5% of burned ETH.\n\nThe recent increase in burn-rate comes after Ethereum\u2019s supply turned inflationary for the first time in 2023 during September and October. Ether\u2019s supply grew by 54,000 coins between the start of September and November as on-chain activity receded.\n\nFor comparison, the network last quoted users 40 gwei in gas fees for transaction execution, up more than 300% since dropping below 10 gwei in September.\n\nEthereum\u2019s burn mechanism has removed more than 260,000 ETH from circulation this year so far.\n\nETH Supply Trends Down After Two Months Of Inflation\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUpcoming NFT game Illuvium is coming to the Epic Games Store, and its impending launch apparently yielded a jump in the price for the Illuvium token, which surged in value following the early Wednesday announcement.\n\nIlluvium is now listed on the Epic Games Store ahead of a November 28 debut for the title\u2019s Beta 3: Arena test, which will focus on player-vs-player (PVP) action. The beta will launch through the popular PC gaming storefront.\n\nNews of Illuvium joining the prominent PC gaming marketplace, which claimed 230 million users as of the end of 2022, appears to have had an immediate impact on the price of the Illuvium (ILV) token on Ethereum, which quickly jumped according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nILV\u2019s price surged from about $65 per token before the news to a peak of $80.49, a nearly 24% rise in a matter of hours. The price has since settled to $75.50 as of this writing, which still marks a 17% increase over the last 24 hours\u2014not to mention a 94% rise over the past 30 days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Major Announcement, Rangers! \ud83c\udf1f Mark your calendars for November 28th!

The game uses various NFTs, including virtual land plots, with one such digital land NFT sale yielding $72 million worth of purchases in June 2022.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s GG went hands-on with the Illuvium Overworld open-world beta in May and came away impressed by its visual quality and dynamic movement, pointing towards a blockchain game with real \u201cAAA\u201d potential. We\u2019ll see how the game has progressed over the past several months when the latest beta drops on November 28.\n\nThe Epic Games Store has proven to be friendly to games with NFTs and crypto tokens, with titles like Gods Unchained, Raini: The Lords of Light, and Blankos Block Party rolling out on the marketplace. Rival storefront Steam has regulations against blockchain games, although some game developers have found ways to skirt or dodge the rules.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRonin may be best known as the Ethereum sidechain network behind Axie Infinity, the play-to-earn monster-battling game that flung NFT gaming into the spotlight back in 2021. But now Ronin is drawing attention for other games\u2014and network activity is surging following last week\u2019s launch of a game called Pixels.\n\nThe number of active wallet addresses on Ronin has effectively tripled in recent days, according to data shared on Twitter by Alex Svanevik, founder and CEO of crypto analytics firm Nansen. As of early Wednesday, it shows a leap from just over 20,000 active daily wallet users to about 70,000.\n\nAll the while, Ronin\u2019s native token RON is pumping, marking a 13% increase over the last 24 hours to a current price of about $0.68, per data from CoinGecko. RON is further up 37% over the past week and 59% in the last 30 days, although other gaming tokens have similarly seen substantial jumps in recent weeks.\n\nPixels, which previously was on Ethereum scaling network Polygon before migrating to Ronin, officially launched on the Axie network on October 31. The game recreates the vibe of a classic 16-bit role-playing adventure, letting players navigate through a pixel-art world as they interact with each other, farm the land, play mini-games, and earn token rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPixels is officially live on @Ronin_network!

Sky Mavis ultimately reimbursed stolen user funds and recovered about 10% of the stolen funds routed through centralized exchanges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAxie Infinity\u2019s own tokens have seen price boosts in recent weeks, as well, with the AXS governance token up 42% in the last 30 days to a current price above $6.00, while the SLP reward token has jumped 71% in that span to a price above $0.002 per token.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether\u2019s middling year pricewise: Q&A - Blockworks",
        "content": "When Ethereum\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d to proof-of-stake went off without a hitch last September, some felt the layer-1 was primed for a breakout. Speculation arose around a \u201cflippening\u201d and institutional investors waited in the wings.\n\nBut ether\u2019s price did not end up meeting these expectations. NFTs tested new lows, and the bear market muted DeFi engagement. Bitcoin continued to outpace ether in 2023 \u2014 recently reaching dominance levels not seen since 2021. Meanwhile, institutional inflows are largely yet to materialize.\n\nBlockworks spoke with Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, about the network\u2019s current standing and future prospects. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks\u2019 interview with Drake.\n\nBlockworks: You can see variations of this stat in different places, but the rewards paid out by Ethereum were larger than the transaction fees that were burned in both September and October. It looks like that\u2019s turned around a little bit, but how should people think about issuance versus burn and when that flips negative?\n\nDrake: The fee market is exceptionally volatile. What you really want to be doing is zooming out, because when you zoom out, you\u2019re smoothing your data over a longer period of time.\n\nIf you look at ultrasound.money, you\u2019ll notice that when it\u2019s profitable, it\u2019s like printing money. It\u2019s really, really profitable. Ethereum has about a profit margin of 50% which is outstanding for a business. Now okay, on some days, especially weekends, it won\u2019t be profitable. In some months, if you\u2019re in the absolute depth of the bear market, then it won\u2019t be profitable. But over a long period of time, it\u2019s extremely profitable.\n\nBlockworks: How important is this deflationary aspect of Ethereum and Ethereum\u2019s ability to generate fees? Because obviously Ethereum is not a company in the traditional sense where your revenues need to outweigh costs. So how should people think about revenue versus issuance? And how important is that metric as a way to gauge the success of the network?\n\nDrake: Broader than just as a company, some people think of ether, the asset, as money for the internet. And in that context, scarcity as a meme is extremely important. There\u2019s this almost obsession with the 21 million Bitcoin meme precisely because it\u2019s all about scarcity. And for the first time in history pretty much, we have money which not only has a fixed supply but actually has a decreasing supply.\n\nSo now there\u2019s what I call memetic potential. Memes are ideas that spread. The 21 million meme is one that spreads far and wide because it\u2019s kind of an attractive thing intellectually. There\u2019s an opportunity potentially for this meme to spread that ether is the scarcest money on Earth. Its supply is going down over time.\n\nBlockworks: And who benefits from this meme?\n\nDrake: Ether the asset is the basis of two very fundamental public goods in any programmable blockchain.\n\nPublic good number one is economic security. We\u2019re trying to build systems here which have a lot of longevity. We want to be in a position where it\u2019s extremely difficult even for the most powerful nation-states out there to attack Ethereum.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this second really important public good for blockchains which is called economic bandwidth, and that\u2019s the ability to be used as collateral within DeFi. Ether is especially valuable as collateral money because it\u2019s the only so-called pristine collateral. Pristine means that there\u2019s no contract risk. There\u2019s no governance risk. There\u2019s no oracle risk. It\u2019s the one risk free asset.\n\nBlockworks: It sounds like you\u2019re saying the idea of ultrasound money is a means to these larger ends that you described.\n\nDrake: Exactly. It\u2019s a Trojan Horse, but ultimately the value is utilitarian through economic security and economic bandwidth.\n\nBlockworks: Ethereum\u2019s validator queue has been in the hundreds of people waiting to stake ether (ETH), and that\u2019s down from tens of thousands over the summer and even into September. What do you make of this?\n\nDrake: The churn, which is basically the amount of validators that can be processed by the queue, is proportional to the amount of staked ETH. As the amount of staked ETH grows, the churn grows and it becomes easier and easier to clear the queue. And so in that sense, looking at the queue is kind of a totally irrelevant game. The fact that the queue is very low just means that ether is very efficient at processing deposits.\n\nThe better metric is what\u2019s called deposits. Every single day on average, there\u2019s 40,000 ETH coming in, which is a huge amount of money.\n\nBlockworks: How concerned are you about staking yields being down?\n\nDrake: I mean in a way, the lower the better, right? Because it means that we\u2019re not spending as much to secure Ethereum. Ethereum is already extremely secure.\n\nThe security ratio is the value secured by Ethereum, which is all the ETH, all the NFTs, all the ERC-20s divided by the value securing Ethereum, and it\u2019s 7.5, which is extremely healthy. If we were to have more staked ETH, this ratio would keep on going down. But there\u2019s no real need for that. And so having more staked ETH in the way is wastefully paying for security.\n\nBlockworks: Post-Merge, there was a lot of excitement about Ethereum. In 2023, ether\u2019s price has gone up, but especially compared to bitcoin, not as much as some had predicted. Why is that?\n\nRead more: The flippening: Will ether flip bitcoin in the next year?\n\nDrake: What tends to happen, generally speaking, is that during bear markets, dominance of bitcoin goes up, and then during bull markets, it drops down precipitously and then it reaches a new low, so this is all standard behavior.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll say is that bitcoin dominance hasn\u2019t grown as much as what would have been expected in the bear market. So I think expectations were unreasonable thinking that during a bear market, ether will outperform [bitcoin].\n\nThis is all speculation, but my guess is that there will be a flippening in the next bull run.\n\nInterview responses were edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
