        "title": "Ethereum falls to lowest level against Bitcoin in 3 years amid panic selling - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum fell against Bitcoin to its lowest point in three years amid the carnage that followed Bitcoin\u2019s fall from $70,000 over the weekend. The ETH-BTC chart reached as low as 0.0462 BTC on Saturday, April 13, down 24% from the year-to-date high of 0.085 BTC.\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time high against Bitcoin came in 2017 when it touched 0.16 BTC before closing the year around similar levels to now at 0.048 BTC. It has since recorded lows around 0.018 BTC in late 2019 before rising significantly throughout the 2020 \u2013 2021 bull market.\n\nThe cycle peak of 0.088 BTC was met with a steady decline throughout 2023, 2022, and 2024. The 0.05 BTC level had been acting as a lower support level until it was breached this month. While the price remains within 7% of the support, it has been almost three years since we\u2019ve seen these prices.\n\nThe decline has been gradual and steady since the start of 2023, with a few bullish breakouts shut down within a couple of months.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains below the 0.05 BTC support level, it has recovered almost 7% from its weekend lows, holding relatively steady amid Bitcoin\u2019s continued struggles. Bitcoin fell from $70,000 to $61,700 over the weekend before recovering to $66,000. However, Bitcoin has retested $61,700 again and is trading around $62,000 as of press time. Ethereum initially followed Bitcoin down from $3,600 to $2,800 \u2013 it has since consolidated around the $3,000 mark, aiding it in its price war with Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the overall crypto market often follows Bitcoin, much of the altcoin market follows Ethereum. The ETH-BTC chart highly influences the delicate relationship between digital asset price movements, and it is one of the staples of the industry. Bitcoin dominance, another critical factor, reached a 3-year high this weekend, touching 57%, while Ethereum dominance dropped to just 15% from a recent high of 19%.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 5,000%, According to Cathie Wood - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The closely followed growth investor expects Ethereum to blast off.\n\nEarlier this year, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood stunned cryptocurrency investors by predicting that Bitcoin's (BTC -2.27%) price would reach $1.5 million by 2027. Wood believes the recent approvals of Bitcoin's first spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), more institutional purchases, and the impending halving of Bitcoin (which will make it twice as hard to mine the cryptocurrency) will all drive a stampede of bulls to the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Wood made an even more bullish prediction for Ethereum (ETH -0.40%), which currently trades at about $3,200. In Ark Invest's \"Big Ideas\" presentation early last year, Wood said Ethereum's market cap could exceed $20 trillion -- which would require a market price of more than $166,000 per token -- by 2032. Could Etherium's price actually soar by over 5,000% to hit that target?\n\nHow is Ethereum different from Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum is the largest cryptocurrency on the open-source Ethereum Network, which differs from Bitcoin (BTC -2.27%) in two key ways. First, miners can only mine for Bitcoin tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, but developers can create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum Network. That flexibility makes Ethereum a core pillar of the Web3 movement, which aims to disrupt centralized app platforms like Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play with decentralized applications and payment methods.\n\nSecond, Ethereum requires much less power to mine than Bitcoin. The Ethereum Network previously used the same energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method as Bitcoin, but it in September 2022, it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method. That transition, dubbed The Merge, reduced the network's total mining energy consumption by 99.95%. Ethereum bulls believe that upgrade will make it easier to expand the Ethereum Network and support more Web3 projects.\n\nWhat are Ethereum's main catalysts?\n\nEthereum is now the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It's also one of eight cryptocurrencies -- which include Bitcoin and six stablecoins from PayPal (PYPL -2.75%) and Gemini (GUSD) -- on the New York State Department of Financial Services' \"green list\" of pre-approved cryptocurrencies. That relative stability suggests the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might eventually approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHowever, the SEC recently reiterated its view that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified as a commodity instead of a security since it still uses the PoW method, which is comparable to physically mining precious metals. The SEC said the PoS method, while more environmentally friendly, makes the cryptos that use it more similar to derivatives contracts -- so Ethereum is more similar to a security than it is to a commodity.\n\nThe SEC also recently requested more information from the Ethereum Foundation, and it remains committed to reclassifying Ethereum and other Ethereum tokens as securities. That position implies the SEC probably won't approve any spot ETFs for Ethereum -- since commodities are more commonly valued by their spot prices -- in the foreseeable future.\n\nBut despite that, Ethereum's periodic burning of its tokens could stabilize its price in the near term. The upcoming upgrades for the Ethereum Network could also make it even easier to facilitate financial transactions and develop more decentralized tokens and apps. More companies could also begin accepting ether, the coin that powers the Ethereum blockchain, as a payment option, and institutional investors could accumulate more of the crypto -- even if it's not as easily accessible as Bitcoin through spot ETFs.\n\nShould you believe Wood's bullish prediction?\n\nInvestors should take Wood's $166,000 price target with a grain of salt. First, the famed growth investor has made plenty of wrong calls. Her firm's flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK 1.29%) has actually declined by 4% over the past five years as the S&P 500 rallied 76%. Ark also offers its own Ethereum futures ETF and is trying to get a spot Ethereum ETF approved, so Wood's opinion is arguably more subjective than objective.\n\nThat said, Wood adamantly believes the expansion of Ethereum's developer base and its potential to \"displace many traditional financial services\" and \"take share from existing financial intermediaries\" will drive its price toward her sky-high target of $166,000. I personally think Ethereum could come up far short of that lofty price in 2032 -- but it could certainly stabilize and head higher over the next few years if the Ethereum Foundation upgrades its network and keeps up with Bitcoin."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sale of ETH since the September 2022 \u201cMerge\u201d constitutes an unregistered securities offering in violation of US law, according to Fortune.\n\nIf the reports are true, then this investigation \u2014 just ahead of the SEC\u2019s May deadline for a decision on an Ethereum spot ETF (more on that later) \u2014 raises the question: Did Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake transform it into a security?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe slightly longer answer is \u201cstill probably no.\u201d\n\nETH tokens are not, in and of themselves, \u201csecurities\u201d in the way that stocks or bonds are. They do not confer legal ownership of any business entity or contractual rights to any kind of payments \u2014 they are just code in a decentralized database.\n\nWhen we talk about ETH \u201cbeing a security,\u201d we are instead actually asking whether the offer and sale of ETH tokens (in a particular context, between a particular buyer and seller) constitutes an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under the dreaded Howey test. Under the Howey test, the offer and sale of an asset like ETH constitutes an investment contract if (1) someone invested money, (2) in a \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d (3) in the expectation of profit and (4) where that expectation is based on the \u201cessential managerial efforts of particular others.\u201d\n\nThe four Howey \u201cprongs\u201d have already been discussed and debated to death in the crypto space, so I\u2019ll avoid beating a dead horse here. But if you look closely at the language from Howey, I think two things quickly become apparent about the sale of ETH tokens over time:\n\nFirst, the sale of pre-mined ETH tokens to investors in Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO sure looks a lot like an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d ICO participants invested money (BTC) in order to receive their allocation of ETH (Howey prong #1). That BTC was pooled to fund a common effort led by Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation to develop the Ethereum blockchain and produce the ETH tokens (Howey prong #2). Given that the Ethereum blockchain \u201cpre-launch\u201d at the time of the ICO, the only plausible motivation to take part in the ICO was to make money on the price appreciation of ETH (Howey prong #3). And, at the time of the ICO, if Ethereum was going to succeed as a protocol and ETH was going to succeed as an asset, Vitalik and his developers were going to have to roll up their sleeves and put in some good old \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d to make the tokens worth anything (Howey prong #4).\n\nHad the SEC brought suit around the time of the Ethereum ICO, they would have almost certainly won in court, and that may well have been the end of ETH.\n\nHowever, the SEC didn\u2019t bring suit, and the statute of limitations for such a claim (typically five years) would have run out in 2019. And importantly, the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved in ways since its ICO that make current sales of ETH tokens look less like an investment contract than they once did.\n\nFor one thing, the proliferation of applications (think DeFi and NFTs) utilizing ETH for \u201cgas\u201d provides a \u201cconsumptive utility\u201d for ETH tokens that challenges the notion that current-day purchases of ETH are solely, or even mainly, based on profit expectation.\n\nEven more important, however, is the so-called \u201cHinman speech\u201d delivered in 2018 by Bill Hinman, then the director of corporation finance at the SEC, where he proposed that a digital asset\u2019s classification under Howey could evolve over time.\n\nAccording to Hinman\u2019s logic \u2014 to the extent that Ethereum\u2019s success no longer hinges on the efforts of a particular entity, like Vitalik or the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 the sale of ETH tokens would no longer fulfill the requirement of the final Howey prong that there be \u201cparticular others\u201d upon whose efforts a buyer would rely for their profits.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Staking or not, ETH is no security\n\nTherefore, regardless of the legally dubious nature of the ICO, the Ethereum network (at least from 2018 onwards) has become \u201csufficiently decentralized.\u201d This means that its native token constitutes a digital commodity like bitcoin, rather than an investment contract, subject to SEC jurisdiction.\n\nSince the Hinman speech, the securities law status of ETH has been at a bit of a stalemate. The SEC has never explicitly endorsed the notion that ETH (even pre-merge) is a digital commodity \u2014 which they readily concede with regard to bitcoin. And Gary Gensler regularly ties himself in knots before Congress trying to evade questions about his view on ETH\u2019s current legal status.\n\nBut the fact remains that (at least until now) the SEC has never brought an action specifically alleging that primary or secondary sales of ETH constitute investment contracts under Howey (like they did with over a dozen other tokens in the Coinbase, Binance and Kraken lawsuits). The SEC even went as far as to approve the listing of ETFs based on ETH futures contracts that trade on the CME, which would be hard to understand if the Commission felt that ETH tokens traded as unregistered securities.\n\nBut what about Ethereum\u2019s migration to proof-of-stake? Does the fact that ETH tokens can be staked for \u201cyield\u201d change the legal situation and turn either (A) current-day sales of ETH, or (B) the act of staking ETH into securities offerings under Howey?\n\nIn my opinion (and I spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about crypto securities law), no.\n\nWith regard to present-day sales of ETH tokens \u2014 whether directly from the Ethereum Foundation or on the secondary market \u2014 I don\u2019t think ETH\u2019s staking functionality makes much of a difference under Howey. That is, the ability to stake does not make ETH tokens any less useful for individuals who might buy them for their consumptive utility (i.e. gas fees).\n\nAnd while the Ethereum Foundation does indeed still hold a large supply of ETH tokens, there is no reason to think that the introduction of staking makes the foundation\u2019s \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d \u201cessential\u201d to the financial success of ETH in some way that was not the case at the time of the 2018 Hinman speech.\n\nThe question of whether the act of staking ETH in order to receive \u201cyield\u201d in the form of staking rewards constitutes an investment contract under Howey is more nuanced \u2014 but properly understood, the answer should still be no.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ether is the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat of crypto\n\nWhen you run a validator node and stake 32 ETH tokens in exchange for rewards, what you are actually doing is providing a service to the Ethereum network and getting paid for that service. You only get the reward if you honestly validate blocks, and you stand to lose your stake to \u201cslashing\u201d if you attempt to validate dishonestly.\n\nThis is very different from the type of passive \u201cyield\u201d you might expect to receive from holding a bond or a dividend-paying stock or real estate asset (which rewards ownership and not activity). Unlike with these traditional financial instruments, you are not relying on \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d of other people in order to profit when you stake ETH directly, but rather on your own skill and honestly as a validator.\n\nThis question becomes trickier, however, when we move from direct proof-of-stake validation to \u201cstaking services\u201d such as those run by exchanges like Coinbase and collaborative staking protocols like Lido and Rocketpool.\n\nAt one end of the extreme, you could see an argument for how custodial staking services could look quite security-like under Howey (given how reliant depositors would be on the staking service provider\u2019s efforts in order to earn yield).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, you could imagine a purely on-chain tool that allowed users to jointly stake their ETH in collective, automated, validator nodes with clearly defined behavior looking much more like direct staking than an investment contract.\n\nWhere the specific services by Coinbase, Lido and Rocketpool fall on this continuum is very much an open legal question \u2014 and one that in Coinbase\u2019s case is being actively litigated in federal court in the Southern District of New York.\n\nBut none of this makes ETH itself, even when being used for staking purposes, an investment contract and therefore none of this seems to justify the SEC\u2019s new investigation.\n\nWhy, then, might the SEC be pursuing this type of weak claim about Ethereum?\n\nObserving the success of the Bitcoin ETF \u2014 and the SEC\u2019s dissatisfaction with its launch \u2014 suggests that the investigation into Ethereum might be a pretext to deny the upcoming spot ETH ETF application.\n\nMoreover, acknowledging Ethereum\u2019s transition to a commodity despite its seemingly illegal ICO genesis could concede a legal strategy meant to apply to other token projects that the SEC believes aiming to circumvent securities classification (in other words, creating a loophole).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s actions could be seen as a strategic move to maintain regulatory leverage over the crypto market, rather than a clear-cut determination of Ethereum\u2019s status as a security.\n\nZack Shapiro is the Managing Partner at Rains and leads the law practice.
