        "content": "Increased demand for the Ethereum network has led to a surge in burn rate.\n\nThis has brought about a decline in the coin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] circulating supply has fallen to a new post-merge low, according to data from Ultrasound.money.\n\nIn the last month, 86,219 ETH worth around $300 million at the altcoin\u2019s press time price has been removed from circulation in the last 30 days.\n\nThe decline in ETH\u2019s circulating supply showed that the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network has seen an uptick in demand and use, causing its burn rate to increase.\n\nAMBCrypto previously reported that the daily count of new addresses created on the Ethereum network recently surpassed 116,000, a year-to-date (YTD) high.\n\nThis signaled a surge in user activity on the Layer 1 (L1) network.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s circulating supply totaled 120.07 million ETH, the lowest level in 548 days since the network transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW), in an event popularly referred to as \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nEcosystem performance in the last month\n\nAn assessment of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem revealed an uptick in total value locked (TVL) in the last month.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $51 billion at press time, rising by 21% in the 30 days. During that period, Lido Finance, the leading protocol on the chain, saw its TVL increase by 27%.\n\nAmid the recent rally in the altcoin market, Ethereum witnessed a spike in its decentralized exchange (DEX) trade volumes in the last month.\n\nAccording to data from Artemis\u2019, the daily trading volume across the DEXes housed within Ethereum has risen by 161% in the past 30 days.\n\nRegarding the network\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) sector, it also witnessed growth in the last month.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, NFT sales volume totaled $617 million in the past 30 days, registering a 17% rally.\n\nThis spike in trading volume occurred despite the 57% decrease in the number of NFT sales transactions completed during that period.\n\nExchange reserve climbs to a one-month high\n\nAs the crypto market becomes significantly overheated, with the crypto fear & greed index indicating a marked increase in greedy sentiment, sell-offs of ETH have surged.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis has resulted in a spike in ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges. Per CryptoQuant\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s exchange reserve was 14.1 million at press time, its highest level in the last month.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s exchange reserve climbs this way, it suggests an increase in selling pressure."
