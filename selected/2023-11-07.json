        "content": "An Estonian banker has confirmed himself to be the owner of an Ethereum address with over 250,000 ETH worth nearly half a billion dollars \u2013 but says he lost the keys.\n\nIn a new interview with Vikerraadio in Estonia, LHV Bank founder Rain L\u00f5hmus was asked about something he said years ago about getting into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum in their early days but then losing access to his wallets.\n\nAsked if he ever found his keys, L\u00f5hmus says,\n\n\u201cNo, and I haven\u2019t made much effort either. It\u2019s no secret that I have a wallet with 250,000 Ethereum units, anyone can calculate for themselves what it\u2019s worth.\n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s hundreds of millions?\n\nYeah, and I can\u2019t solve this alone; if someone thinks they can, I\u2019ll take all offers. My own best plan is to build Rain L\u00f5hmus as an AI and see if he can get his memories back.\n\nL\u00f5hmus said the dangers of handling your own keys and seed phrases was one of the weak points of crypto.\n\n\u201cI absolutely agree that this is a very weak point of this system, which makes you think that this perfect decentralization has other risks that you don\u2019t usually think about. But it\u2019s very common for me to lose passwords. I went to renew my ID card passwords today; if it were crypto, I\u2019d be in a big crisis again, but luckily the police and border police work.\u201d\n\nBased on the information shared by L\u00f5hmus, on-chain analysts have identified his Ethereum address, and according to Etherscan, it is the fourth biggest holding of ETH excluding exchanges, the Ethereum Foundation, and the Wrapped Ether (wETH) address.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "On the Cosmos-based EVM chain Evmos, Cosmos transactions and Ethereum transactions have been operating under different standards, leading to complications as these two types of transactions struggle to decode each other effectively.\n\nEvmos plans to relieve this technical headache by only supporting Ethereum-formatted transactions by 2024 Q3, it announced in a blog post Tuesday. Despite this strategic shift, the protocol emphasized that Evmos is not exiting the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, Evmos\u2019 founder suggested that the move could help bring Ethereum developers to the IBC.\n\nEvmos functions as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that integrates the Cosmos IBC protocol, allowing it to operate as an EVM within the Cosmos network. Evmos raised $27 million via token sale in late 2022.\n\nRead more: Uniting the blockchain ecosystems: Q&A with Cosmos founder Ethan Buchman\n\nThe project\u2019s co-founder Federico Kunze K\u00fcllmer said that by only supporting Ethereum transactions, Evmos hopes to make it easier for Ethereum developers to start working in Cosmos.\n\n\u201cThe wallets and the tools that they are already used to on Ethereum do not work easily on Cosmos,\u201d K\u00fcllmer said. \u201cWe want to make it very easy for the developers and users that are already interacting with Ethereum wallets to interact with any Cosmos application specific blockchain.\u201d\n\nThe Interchain Foundation, a non-profit focused on Cosmos adoption, made onboarding Ethereum developers a large part of its 2024 roadmap, Blockworks previously reported.\n\nIn the lead-up to fully embracing Ethereum-formatted transactions by Q3 2024, the protocol has committed to burning all Cosmos transaction fees during this interim period. This action will effectively remove these fees from circulation, signaling a shift towards revised token economics for the EVMOS token. K\u00fcllmer indicated that further details on the new tokenomics will be unveiled next week.\n\nEvmos (EVMOS) was worth around $0.07 at the time of publication.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The latter is famous on Twitter for tracking huge sums of cryptocurrencies that were once lost by their owners.\n\nRain Lohmus, the founder of LHV Bank, received 250K $ETH from the #EthereumICO.\n\n\n\nThe cost is ~$77.5K, and now worth ~$473M.\n\n\n\nBut unfortunately, he lost the keys.https://t.co/PG2vALcDmU pic.twitter.com/ZPuexmdR1t \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 7, 2023\n\n$437 million in ETH locked dead over lost wallet keys\n\nData shared by Grogan in a recent tweet shows that he had managed to identify the unknown whale who acquired approximately $77,500 worth of ETH. This crypto, Grogan comments, has been completely untouched, and there has not been a single transfer made from it since 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe owner turned out to be the founder of LHV Bank based in the Baltics, Rain Lohmus. Apparently, he has lost his private keys and has been unable to move his ETH or convert in into fiat.\n\nBy now, the ETH he holds is worth roughly $437 million \u2013 that is 5,333x growth.\n\nGrogan mentioned that if anyone can help him recover these hundreds of millions, he is willing to pay a generous reward for it: \"If you can help him recover them somehow, he's willing to split them with you.\"\n\nNearly 910,000 ETH lost forever in total\n\nSumming up his recent estimations, Conor Grogan stated that the overall amount of Ethereum that has been lost for good with very low chances of recovery now constitutes 886,000 ETH \u2013 that is more than $1.63 billion in the fiat equivalent.\n\nWith a few extra addresses added, the total amount of lost Ether rises to 909,800 ETH, worth more than $1.73 billion, or over 0.75% of the whole Ethereum supply circulating on the market.\n\nAdded a few extra addresses I've been meaning to (Incl. Prime Trust lost ETH) and we are up to 909,800 ETH worth $1.73B+ that are lost forever: 0.75%+ of all circulating supply pic.twitter.com/mb2XSqsQb2 \u2014 Conor (@jconorgrogan) November 6, 2023\n\nLargest ETH outflow from CEX observed\n\nAs reported by on-chain data vendor IntoTheBlock earlier, over the past week, a massive outflow of Ethereum was detected from centralized crypto exchanges \u2013 the largest outflow since August.\n\nIn total, more than $210,000,000 worth of Ethereum was moved to self-custody by investors. A likely reason for this is that investors plan to hold their ETH long term, which is best to do in one's own wallets rather than holding digital currencies on crypto exchanges.\n\nBetween Sunday and Monday this week, the second largest crypto, Ethereum, staged a minor growth of 3.13%, reaching the $1,914 level. However, within the last 24 hours, ETH failed to hold there or show a further rise. Instead, the crypto went down by 2.33%, now exchanging hands at $1,869 on the Bitstamp exchange."

        "title": "Ethereum Rival Solana Is Back\u2014Experts Say It's No Surprise - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is once again the talk of crypto, and its native coin SOL is benefiting from the attention. The price of SOL is up over 9% today, hitting a 24-hour high of $44.41.\n\nOver the past 30 days, it has exploded in value by over 88%, according to CoinGecko\u2014making it the biggest winner of all the major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd despite its association with the collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its criminally convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried, experts say Solana\u2019s recent rise shouldn\u2019t come as a shock.\n\nWidely considered a competitor to Ethereum, Solana aims to be the go-to network for on-chain applications and experiences. Ethereum proponents argue that the leading smart contract network offers greater stability and security, but Solana is objectively cheaper and faster for those wanting to build or use lending protocols, games, and other applications that utilize blockchain technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana gas fees right now stand at $0.000522; to make a transaction on Ethereum, it costs $6.58 on average.\n\nFor this reason, Solana has grabbed the attention of Visa, Shopify, and developers wanting to build on the network.\n\n\u201cSolana adopts a streamlined approach, emphasizing high base layer throughput while simplifying the developer experience,\u201d portfolio manager at Yield App Akash Mahendra told Decrypt, highlighting how much data can be processed by the blockchain.\n\nMahendra added that major partnerships and institutional interest are also helping drive up the price of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that Solana was getting a bad rep. FTX, once one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the crypto space, was heavily invested in Solana.\n\nEx-FTX boss and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a prominent Solana supporter, and the company invested in numerous Solana-related projects. FTX launched a marketplace for Solana NFTs, and even co-created Serum, which at one point was considered a foundation of the Solana DeFi space. At its peak in 2021, Solana commanded a market cap of $78 billion and boasted a $10 billion DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFTX then collapsed in a highly publicized bankruptcy while holding over $1 billion in SOL. The cryptocurrency plunged as a result.\n\nBut big players still see real value in the project.\n\nIn August, Solana\u2019s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain. This collaboration \u201ccapitalized on Shopify\u2019s influential 10% share in the U.S. online retail sector, which translates to an estimated $444 billion in global transactions,\u201d according to Mahendra.\n\nThen, payments giant Visa announced in September that it had chosen Solana\u2019s blockchain for its stablecoin ambitions. This, according to Solana Foundation\u2019s head of strategy Austin Federa, \u201cvalidates the importance of the network\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability.\u201d\n\nThese two moves were seen as bullish by investors who have since been plugging fresh cash into the project. And things really picked up in the last month.\n\nPatrick Felder, founder & CIO at Prismatic Capital, told Decrypt this was because when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market started rallying, SOL was the most deeply oversold asset in the space following news that FTX\u2019s new management might sell off large amounts of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this, according to Felder, was \u201cmassively overblown\u201d FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and \u201ctriggered a massive short squeeze.\u201d In the world of trading, a short squeeze is when the price of an asset shoots up unexpectedly due to short sellers (those who\u2019ve bet on the asset going down) exiting their positions.\n\nThis happened with SOL, according to Felder, as many had bet on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX trial hurting the asset's price.\n\nThe Solana community\u2019s annual conference, Breakpoint, took place at the end of October, leading to an even bigger rally, added Felder.\n\nThe irony is that at Breakpoint last year, the price of SOL had plunged by 60% in the week following the FTX crash. Spirits were low. But now, the coin has made a stunning comeback.\n\nAs always the question is, will it last?\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."
