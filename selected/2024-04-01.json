The list of angel investors includes Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, co-founders of Solana, Luca Netz, owner and CEO of Pudgy Penguins, and Gabby Dizon, co-founder of Yield Guild Games.\n\nThis latest round of funding follows Parallel's previous raise of $50 million from Paradigm in 2021, which valued the studio at $500 million. While the updated valuation and the format of the recent funding round were not disclosed, Parallel Studios did share some insights into how they plan to utilize the $35 million infusion.\n\nThe studio intends to expand its user base by onboarding more players through the Parallel Ambassadors program and engaging influencers. Additionally, Parallel Studios has exciting plans for the future. They aim to launch Parallel on the Epic Games Store and Steam, as well as introduce the Planetfall expansion within the game. Mobile versions of Parallel are also in consideration, although specific timelines have yet to be determined.\n\nIn addition to Parallel, the studio has been actively developing Colony, an AI-powered \"survival simulation\" game built on the Solana blockchain. Colony differentiates itself from Parallel by utilizing generative AI technology. Funding from this round will contribute to the development of Wayfinder, an on-chain AI protocol that powers Colony and potentially other applications and games."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs the second quarter of 2024 begins, Ethereum (ETH) investors are looking to history for clues about the potential performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Ethereum's price history reveals a pattern of robust Q2 gains, with an average increase of 67.19%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto analyst Ali shared a screenshot of Ethereum's quarterly returns; ETH saw massive gains of 453% and 102.25% in Q2 of 2017 and 2019, respectively. Gains for the second quarter averaged 67.19%, with a median of 15.29%.\n\nQ2 has historically been very bullish for $ETH!\n\n\n\nHowever, we must consider the high probability that the @SECGov will delay the approval of a spot #Ethereum ETF, which may cause turbulence in the market. pic.twitter.com/TlZ3KZhr4e \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2024\n\nThis positive trend has been consistent enough to catch the eye of investors who see Q2 as a period of opportunity for Ethereum, with many anticipating another season of strong returns.\n\nHowever, the potential denial of a spot Ethereum ETF, which might cause significant price volatility, casts a shadow over this optimistic outlook.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated investment platform for institutional and individual investors, thereby increasing demand and driving up ETH prices. Several issuers, including VanEck and Fidelity, have sought approval to launch them.\n\nHowever, approval for such an ETF is far from guaranteed. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts believe there is only a 25% likelihood of approval.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission previously postponed a decision on a spot exchange-traded fund, but it must make one by May 23, which is one of the applicants' final deadlines.\n\nOn May 23, the SEC will decide whether to approve or refuse VanEck's application. If they decline the request, issuers who still want to be approved will have to refile applications, or they can challenge the regulator's decision through litigation.\n\nSeven issuers are proposing to launch a spot Ethereum ETF fund: BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares with Ark and Hashdex.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 1.59% in the last 24 hours, at $3,558. Ethereum temporarily rose above $3,600 over the weekend after falling as much as 25% between March 11 and 19. According to Santiment, the number of ETH addresses holding coins has reached highs of 118,230, with midterm MVRV suggesting a mild bullish signal."
