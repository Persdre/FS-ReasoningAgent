        "title": "SEC considered Ethereum unregistered security for at least a year: FOX Business - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum's legal status is questioned amid SEC's intensifying scrutiny.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has been operating under the belief that Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto, is an unregistered security. This perspective has been held for at least a year, FOX Business reported on Monday, citing recent court filings.\n\nThe filings emerged from a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys last week, which is challenging the SEC\u2019s attempt to classify Ethereum as a security. Consensys\u2019 legal action follows a Wells Notice from the SEC, which signaled the agency\u2019s intention to sue the firm for not complying with federal securities laws.\n\nAccording to FOX Business, the documents reveal that the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, under the direction of Gurbir Grewal, initiated a formal investigation into Ethereum\u2019s status as a security in March 2023. This investigation, referred to as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d investigation, aims to explore transactions and activities related to Ethereum dating back to at least 2018.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told FOX Business that the SEC sent multiple document requests and subpoenas to firms associated with Ethereum, including Consensys. MetaMask\u2019s parent company reportedly received four subpoenas from the SEC and a Wells Notice.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s current position appears to contradict previous guidance from 2018 when then-Director of Corporation Finance at the SEC Bill Hinman stated that Ethereum was not considered a security due to its decentralized nature. Comparatively, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission later classified ETH as a commodity.\n\nConsensys\u2019 legal action against the SEC aims for the court to resolve the dispute over Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, a case that could have wide-reaching implications for the crypto industry, akin to previous cases against major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum network has reached a significant milestone, hitting 1 million validators. Terence Tsao, an Ethereum developer who goes by the name \"Terence.eth\" on X, took to social media to celebrate the milestone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We reached 1 million validators,\" Terence wrote on X, attaching a screenshot. According to the screenshot, Ethereum active validators have reached 1,000,012, while pending validators total 14,379.\n\nThis milestone is accompanied by an impressive figure of approximately 32 million Ethereum staked (32,000,026 ETH). This figure represents around 26% of Ethereum's total supply, demonstrating a substantial degree of participation in ETH staking. Staking is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software.\n\nValidators are critical to the Ethereum network, especially since its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022. They are responsible for storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, a role previously filled by miners in the proof-of-work (PoW) model, thus keeping Ethereum secure and earning new ETH in the process.\n\nReaching one million validators is more than just a statistic; it represents the enormous amount of trust and resources that users are willing to commit to keeping the ETH network running.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade, which enabled staking withdrawals, has increased the number of validators on the Ethereum network.\n\nPresently, the Ethereum network is gearing up for new upgrades: Electra is the consensus layer (CL) upgrade name for the next immediate hard fork scheduled on Ethereum. Deneb refers to the most recent hard fork activated on Ethereum.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 5.139% in the last 24 hours to $3,123. According to crypto analyst Ali, the Ethereum price action is facing a brickwall resistance at $3,200, where 2.43 million addresses hold 5.14 million ETH."

        "title": "SEC Has Secretly Considered Ethereum a Security Since 2023, Says Consensys in Unredacted Lawsuit - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has internally considered Ethereum to be a security for over a year, according to previously redacted portions of a lawsuit filed by software giant Consensys against the SEC that were revealed this morning.\n\nPer Consensys\u2019 complaint, Gurbir Grewal, the Commission\u2019s Director of the Division of Enforcement, issued an internal Formal Order on March 28, 2023, announcing an investigation into \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d authorizing employees of the regulator to investigate and subpoena parties involved in the buying and selling of ETH.\n\nThe order, which Consensys says was approved by the Commission on April 13, 2023, explicitly refers to Ethereum as a security in and of itself, as it authorizes the investigation of \u201ccertain securities, including, but not limited to ETH, as to which no registration statement was or is in effect\u2026 and for which no exemption was or is available.\u201d\n\nThe revelation that the SEC has officially considered ETH to be a security for over a year is a remarkable one. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly deferred when asked explicitly regarding the agency\u2019s stance on the matter. As recently as last month, Gensler refused to state the SEC\u2019s position when it comes to ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn SEC spokesperson told Decrypt that the regulator declines to comment on the matter.\n\nEthereum, which had already been sagging with the rest of the market on Monday, was trading for $3,143.69 at the time of writing\u2014marking a 5% slip from this time yesterday, but only 1.5% lower than this time last week, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nFor years, the crypto industry has held out hope that Ethereum\u2014the second largest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin, and the foundation of the massive Ethereum ecosystem\u2014might be considered a commodity in the American government\u2019s eyes, paving the way for ETH\u2019s integration into the American economy on a trajectory similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThe head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has explicitly declared Ethereum to be a commodity in the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt would appear that the SEC\u2019s scrutiny of Ethereum escalated after the blockchain\u2019s September 2022 merge event, which transitioned it to an energy-efficient proof of stake consensus mechanism. That new structure now allows users to stake ETH with the network to help it function\u2014and accrue rewards in the process\u2014a financial incentive the SEC clearly takes issue with.\n\nIn the year following the SEC\u2019s reported internal Formal Order regarding Ethereum, the agency has steadily ratcheted up its offensive against entities involved with the cryptocurrency. In February, the Ethereum Foundation, the Swiss non-profit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem, was subpoenaed by an unnamed \u201cstate authority.\u201d Several American crypto companies have received subpoenas related to their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAnd last week, Consensys, perhaps the largest Ethereum-focused American company, filed a preemptive lawsuit against the SEC, arguing that it does not have the grounds to regulate Ethereum, as the asset should not be classified as a security.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to reflect the SEC's decision not to comment on the unredacted lawsuit and to clarify the process of ETH staking.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."
