        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says that he\u2019s expecting Ethereum (ETH) to correct sharply to below the $1,000 level.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 790,000 YouTube subscribers that historically, ETH often \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows at least twice before moving into a new bull phase.\n\nThe analyst points out the retests of cycle lows in 2015, 2016 and 2020 and says that another low in 2022 has yet to be retested.\n\nCowen forecasts that Ethereum first breaks down in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) before ETH/USD follows suit, likely this year.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting is that sometime in the next few months, ETH/BTC breaks down. After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down.\n\nOne of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn\u2019t tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low. Look at all the prior examples\u2026\n\nSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\n\nIt could still take some time given these narratives that are floating around, given the spot ETF for ETH, given the halving narratives, it could take some time for that to play out.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,268.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Key Levels to Watch As Ethereum Price Sparks New Recovery at $2200 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has recently experienced an uptick in demand, particularly noticeable around the $2200 level. This change is highlighted by distinct long-tail rejection candles observed on its daily chart, indicating a decrease in bearish momentum. This shift comes in tandem with the Bitcoin price stabilization above $40000, alongside a broader uptick in altcoin markets, sparking a new relief rally.\n\nOver the past three days, the Ethereum price has seen a nearly 4% increase, now trading around the $2280 mark. Given this renewed buying pressure, can Ethereum leverage this momentum to surpass the $2500 threshold once again?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBear Trap Reboots Recovery Sentiment in ETH\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed Index at 48% reflects a neutral sentiment among traders.\n\nThe $2200 support backed by several technical levels creates a stoned support region.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.3 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nOver the recent fortnight, the Ethereum price experienced a pronounced correction, with its value plunging from $2714 to a low of $2168, marking a significant 20% decrease. During this pullback, the coin price broke below the channel pattern\u2019s support trendline, which underpinned a recovery rally for nearly three months.\n\nHowever, as the broader market\u2019s bearish momentum began to fade, the ETH price demonstrated resilience around the $2200 mark, successfully reclaiming the previously breached support trendline. This reversal marked the prior downfall as a \u2018Bear Trap,\u2019 and triggered additional buying orders in the market, evidenced by considerable short liquidation.\n\nCurrently trading at $2280, if Ethereum can maintain its position above this reclaimed support, it could initiate a 6.85% relief rally, aiming for the $2430 level. This immediate resistance aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, highlighting a pivotal barrier that sellers are likely to defend vigorously.\n\nTherefore, for Ether to continue its upward trajectory and potentially retest the $2700 mark, a breakout above this critical resistance level is essential to gain further momentum.\n\nHas Ethereum Price Entered Downtrend Momentum?\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s daily time frame chart, it\u2019s evident that corrections are a regular occurrence. In November 2023, the cryptocurrency underwent a 38.2% correction, followed by a 23.6% retracement in December 2023. Such trends suggest that these retracements, particularly around the 38.2% Fibonacci level, are typical for Ether, often serving as a precursor to subsequent upward movements.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): Amid the recent downturn, the 100-day EMA slope at $2200 showcased its sustainability as valid pullback support.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope below 45% reflects the market sentiment currently bearish.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency's supporters are hoping this is just the beginning of a long-running bull market.\n\nAfter tanking 68% in 2022, Ethereum (ETH -1.01%) experienced a resurgence last year, as the digital asset soared 91% in 2023. This was on the back of renewed optimism in the crypto industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains 49% off its all-time high. And the current dip might be a rare opportunity.\n\nShould investors buy this leading cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,500? Let's look at both the bull and bear cases for Ethereum, so that investors can make an informed decision.\n\nWhat the bulls are saying\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency that incorporated functionality for smart contracts. And this means that it had greater potential to introduce various use cases.\n\nThis includes decentralized applications, in verticals including gaming, social, governance, and even art. But one area that has huge potential is decentralized finance (DeFi). According to coinmarketcap.com, Ethereum has 71% of the $105 billion of total value locked in the entire cryptocurrency industry. This metric measures how much capital is staked or locked up in DeFi applications, indicating Ethereum's dominance.\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum's network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Supporters had long waited for this upgrade, called The Merge, to make the cryptocurrency better capable of scaling up. This also reduced its energy usage by 99.95%. Furthermore, the hope is that Ethereum can process more transactions at lower costs. And this should continue to make this blockchain network a hotbed when it comes to developer activity.\n\nAnother reason why Ethereum might be on your investing radar has to do with the potential for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hit the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin spot ETFs recently, and there's optimism this could happen with Ethereum as well. So far, BlackRock and Ark Invest, among other asset managers, have filed applications. This could bring in massive amounts of institutional capital to Ethereum, which could support a higher price over time.\n\nThe bears have compelling arguments\n\nThe entire premise of cryptocurrencies is to take power away from central authorities and give it to the community. The goal is to create decentralized networks where individuals are in control. The issue with Ethereum, though, is that it's still controlled by a small group of people. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has an outsize influence on the direction of the crypto. Some might view this as a huge risk because he can take actions that are more favorable to himself.\n\nBesides The Merge, Ethereum's leaders have a comprehensive roadmap that includes numerous other upgrades to the network, called the Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. While this is encouraging, because it shows how well thought out Ethereum's development pipeline is, it adds tremendous technical risk. Anytime software is changed, a lot can go wrong, thus opening up Ethereum to software bugs that could make it easier for hackers to attack the network and steal people's private keys.\n\nInvestors also can't ignore regulatory concerns. SEC chair Gary Gensler has come out and said before that he views Bitcoin as a commodity, while all other cryptocurrencies are likely securities. This means Ethereum could face a more stringent regulatory framework going forward, which could discourage capital and talent from migrating to it.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum? It depends.\n\n\n\nBoth the bull and bear cases hold a lot of weight. Investors should consider the facts and come to their own conclusion about what to do with this cryptocurrency as it relates to their portfolio composition. Everyone has a different perspective.\n\nIf you're willing to take the risk, accept the uncertainty, and understand that there will be lots of volatility, then initiating a tiny position in Ethereum while it's still below $2,500 might make sense. Of course, it's critical to maintain a long-term mindset of at least five to 10 years if you go this route."

        "title": "What Is Ronin? The Ethereum Gaming Chain Behind 'Axie Infinity' and 'Pixels' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the wide world of crypto, there are now many blockchains specifically designed for gaming\u2014but Ronin was among the first to launch.\n\nGaming blockchains are typically built to offer low transaction fees and a higher number of potential transactions, so they\u2019re supposed to be more affordable and more scalable than blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some gaming chains are also private, meaning that developers must gain approval from a blockchain\u2019s creators in order to join its ecosystem.\n\nRonin is one of those examples\u2014at least for now, though founders have said they intend to open it up sometime in 2024 for more studios to build on. In the meantime, games like Pixels and Axie Infinity are drawing players to the Ethereum sidechain network. Here's what you need to know about it.\n\nWhat is Ronin?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRonin is a gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain designed to handle transactions at a much faster and cheaper rate than Ethereum's own mainnet. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain originally launched back in February 2021.\n\nIt originally launched a \u201cproof of authority\u201d blockchain (PoA), meaning individuals Ronin deems reputable run validator nodes, a type of computer software, to confirm transactions on its blockchain. One common criticism of the PoA method, however, is that a lot of trust must be placed in a smaller number of validators\u2014so it\u2019s less decentralized than other methods.\n\nIn March 2022, the Ronin\u2019s bridge experienced a massive $622 million hack. The bridge connects Ronin to Ethereum. The U.S. Treasury blamed North Korean hackers for the attack\u2014and some of the lost funds were eventually recovered. Affected users were fully refunded by the Ronin network and developer Sky Mavis in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, the Ronin blockchain switched to the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism (DPoS), meaning that it no longer operates as a PoA blockchain. DPoS allows for more decentralization, as now any Ronin (RON) token holder with at least 250,000 RON staked on its blockchain can \u201cdelegate\u201d or select validators for the network.\n\nWhat is RON?\n\nThe Ronin token, also known as RON, is the gas token for the Ronin blockchain. Ronin network users need a bit of RON to pay for transactions on the blockchain. RON can also be staked to participate in the blockchain\u2019s aforementioned DPoS mechanism, or can be staked for other decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRON set an all-time high price of $4.45 in March 2024, beating the long-standing record from 2022. Ronin's token has gained substantially so far in 2024 on the back of hype around Pixels and other games launching on the network, along with a broader markets upswing led by Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the Ronin Wallet?\n\nSky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Wallet is a crypto wallet for the Ronin blockchain ecosystem that exists as both a web browser extension and a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nIn early 2024, the mobile wallet\u2019s developers announced new features in an effort to expand its capabilities, adding support for other blockchains like Ethereum sidechain Polygon and the EVM-compatible BNB Chain. It\u2019s also added Binance Pay as a feature, which allows users to buy some of the Ronin ecosystem's tokens.\n\nOther tokens running on Ronin include Axie Infinity's AXS governance token and Smooth Love Potion (SLP) rewards token, Pixels' PIXEL token, and Apeiron's APRS ecosystem token.\n\nWhat is Sky Mavis?\n\nSky Mavis is a crypto tech startup founded in 2018 that created both the Ronin blockchain and its flagship game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis has five co-founders: Trung Nguyen, Aleksander Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Viet Anh Ho Sy, and Tu Doan.\n\nAccording to Tracxn data, Sky Mavis has 26 institutional investors, with Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) among them. Sky Mavis has raised $311 million in funding at time of writing, per Tracxn, with its latest round a Series B that raised $150 million in April 2022. That round was raised to help refund Ronin users after the aforementioned hack.\n\nWhich games are on Ronin?\n\nSky Mavis' own Axie Infinity launched the network, and it's a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired play-to-earn game where players can fight each other in battles where they must pit axolotl-inspired creatures called \u201cAxies\u201d against each other. Every Axie is an NFT that can be bought and sold. Thanks to a recent update, some Axies can now be upgraded, too.\n\nMore recently, Pixels has been the network's biggest hit, delivering a social farming simulation akin to Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, but with crypto incentives and NFT land plots. The game has attracted millions of players, initially fueled by its play-to-airdrop campaigns\u2014but the buzz is still going after the token launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond Axie and Pixels, Sky Mavis has started to onboard other external game developers onto the Ronin blockchain, adding games like Apeiron, The Machines Arena, Kaidro, Tribesters: Island of Solas, and Civitas, to name a few. But some games have left Ronin too\u2014such as Zoids Wild Arena and Battle Bears.\n\nWhat's next for Ronin?\n\nAlong with plans to open up the network to all builders at some point, Sky Mavis has also shared how it plans to expand the network to meet future demand. In April 2024, the company detailed plans to implement zero-knowledge rollups, tapping zkEVM tech to help grow the network in the coming years.\n\nRonin will become more Ethereum aligned. We are Ethereum\u2019s best chance at onboarding everyday people. We\u2019ve been doing it for 6 years but get no recognition since we aren\u2019t a true L2 yet. We will be the #1 ETH L2 by adoption. https://t.co/ekmUWVNmfZ \u2014 Jihoz.ron (@Jihoz_Axie) April 3, 2024\n\nIn a tweet, Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin wrote that Ronin will \"become more Ethereum-aligned\" as a result.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nThis story was originally published on January 28, 2024 and last updated with new details on April 8."

        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 5 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum vs. the world: Check out how the smart-contract sector will evolve over the next few years, and how the leading platform compares to its main rivals.\n\nThe latest crypto winter is thawing out as we speak. From crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving institutional investor interest to planned technology upgrades to many of the leading crypto platforms, investors have found many new reasons to pay close attention to this space again.\n\nAs a result, smart-contract leader Ethereum (ETH -1.01%) has enjoyed a 46% price jump from the most recent market trough in October 2023. Archrivals Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO) nearly tripled over the same time span -- and up-and-comer Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) more than tripled.\n\nDoes Ethereum have the right moves to counter these high-stakes gambits from its competitors on the grand chessboard of public opinion and developer interest? Let's see how the next three years might play out for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Ethereum echoes Bitcoin's market melody\n\nFirst, let me point out that Ethereum tends to follow the price trends of sector giant Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in the long run -- sometimes amplified and sometimes muted in comparison to its larger cousin, but almost always moving in the same direction. In other words, the two charts are strongly correlated.\n\nSo when Bitcoin gears up for halving the rewards handed out to its miners, as it does roughly once every four years, that event is expected to drive both cryptocurrencies higher over the following year or so. That trend played out in 2016 and 2020 although Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin's big gains in the former cycle. So the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for late April 2024, should pour fresh fuel on the fires of most cryptocurrencies -- Ethereum included.\n\nThe journey ahead: Ethereum's planned upgrades\n\nThe halving event should provide a rising tide to lift all encrypted boats, but how will Ethereum tackle the soaring competition? Would investors be better off in speed-focused rivals like Avalanche, Cardano, and Algorand in the long run?\n\nWell, let's see. Ethereum is in the middle of a multiyear platform upgrade, formerly known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. The switch to a proof-of-stake system is already in the books, to be followed by several stepwise technical boosts over the next five to 10 years. The precise order of these updates will vary depending on many external factors, but the process should look something like this, according to the official Ethereum development roadmap:\n\nSharding will split the workload of validating transactions into smaller, more manageable batches. This speed-boosting upgrade is running ahead of schedule, as one early step turned out to be more helpful than expected.\n\nInstead of waiting 15 minutes for validation, the same processing batch could address both the creation and validation of the same transaction. This may be the next step, and a significant upgrade to Ethereum's transaction speed.\n\nSeveral security updates are in the works, aiming to protect the blockchain from different attack types. For example, hardening the blockchain against quantum computing attacks is currently seen as a low priority, but could move up the chain if quantum hardware makes a sudden performance leap. Stay tuned.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum executes every smart contract by referring to externally owned accounts (EOAs). This architecture helps developers pull in real-world data from so-called oracle networks such as Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) , resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative.\n\n, resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative. Finally, mastermind Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to be a stateless system in the long run. This next-level spin on sharding would allow each processing node to manage just a small slice of the blockchain's total data, lowering the costs of participation while increasing processing speeds dramatically. However, this is a true long-term goal requiring dramatic changes to Ethereum's technical platform, and you shouldn't expect it anytime soon.\n\nSo Ethereum is taking steps to match the ultra-fast transaction processing speed of Avalanche and Cardano while also building a more robust and flexible platform for blockchain-based app development. Only time will tell how closely the Ethereum project will stick to its stated long-term plans, but there have been more positive surprises than unexpected snags so far.\n\nEthereum looks ready to rumble\n\nIn my view, the ball is in the court of so-called \"Ethereum killers.\" The leading smart-contract platform looks ready to meet their challenges over the next few years.\n\nOf course, the upstarts aren't sitting on their digital hands. Cardano, Algorand, and Avalanche are also boosting their already fast processing speeds while aiming for greater stability. Any one of them might come up with a game-changing innovation someday.\n\nThe challengers are fighting an uphill battle, though. Ethereum got a head start on the rest of the field, setting industry standards and gathering developer interest several years before the other names even existed. The sheer inertia of an established developer group's existing preferences makes it hard for other platforms to steal Ethereum's smart-contract throne.\n\nBut the presence of several healthy rivals should also drive Ethereum to greater heights in the long run. I can't wait to see how this Gulliver-vs.-Lilliput battle will play out over the years. All four of these cryptocurrencies may have bright futures, but Ethereum has the clearest path to sustained success. The giant isn't even on its knees yet."
