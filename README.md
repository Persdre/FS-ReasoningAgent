# FS-ReasoningAgent
While many studies prove more advanced LLMs perform better on tasks such as math and trading, we notice that in cryptocurrency trading, stronger LLMs work worse than weaker LLMs often. To study how this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs, we examine the LLM reasoning processes on making trading decisions. We find that separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components can lead to higher profits. Building on this insight, we introduce a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Then, we conduct extensive experiments showing that this framework improves LLMs' trading performance in the cryptocurrency. We encourage the research community to move beyond the assumption that stronger LLMs always deliver better performance. Instead, the focus should be on understanding the preferences and strengths of different LLMs to select the most suitable one for specific tasks.

Analyzing the recent Ethereum data, the opening price of $2,241.75 is supported by robust network activity, evidenced by 577,757 unique addresses and over 1.08 million total transactions. The substantial total gas used at approximately 107.56 billion units, coupled with an average gas price of around 18.59 Gwei, indicates strong demand for transaction processing and network utilization. With a high success rate of nearly 98.2% for transactions and a significant total value transferred exceeding 2.696 × 10²¹ wei (approximately 2.696 million ETH), the metrics suggest increasing investor engagement and transactional volume. Statistically, these indicators point towards a bullish trend for Ethereum, underpinned by growing user activity and sustained demand, though attention should be paid to potential fluctuations in gas prices that could impact overall network dynamics.

Recent developments in the Ethereum market present a mixed outlook for investors. Former President Donald Trump has sold over 1,000 ETH, amounting to approximately $2.4 million, during a period when Ethereum had previously seen significant gains, including a 17% increase in the month leading up to the sale. Despite these individual transactions, the broader crypto market is currently under pressure due to a Bitcoin sell-off, causing Ethereum to decline by 14% over the past week alongside other major cryptocurrencies like Solana and AVAX. On a positive front, Polymer Labs has secured $23 million in Series A funding to implement the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol on Ethereum, aiming to enhance blockchain interoperability and potentially drive future growth. Overall, while short-term market sentiment appears bearish due to macroeconomic factors, ongoing technological advancements and funding initiatives like Polymer Labs’ efforts may support Ethereum’s long-term prospects.

Factual News Analysis:
Recent developments in the Ethereum market present a mixed outlook for investors.

**Trading Recommendation: Hold with a Cautious Long Bias**

**Reasoning:**

**1. Short-Term Market Sentiment: Bearish Pressure**
- **Market-Wide Decline:** Ethereum has experienced a 14% decline over the past week, mirroring the broader cryptocurrency market's downturn driven by a Bitcoin sell-off. Given Bitcoin's dominant influence on the crypto market, continued weakness in BTC could exert downward pressure on ETH in the near term.
- **Significant ETH Sell-Off:** The sale of over 1,000 ETH by a high-profile individual, such as former President Donald Trump, totaling approximately $2.4 million, contributes to negative sentiment. Large transactions by prominent figures can signal diminished confidence, potentially spooking other investors.

**2. Positive Long-Term Indicators: Technological and Network Strength**
- **Technological Advancements:** Polymer Labs securing $23 million in Series A funding to implement the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol on Ethereum is a significant positive. Enhanced interoperability can drive broader adoption and integration with other blockchain ecosystems, potentially boosting Ethereum's utility and demand in the long run.
- **Robust On-Chain Metrics:**
  - **Network Activity:** With 577,757 unique addresses and over 1.08 million total transactions, Ethereum demonstrates strong and growing user engagement.
  - **High Gas Usage and Transaction Volume:** A total gas used of approximately 107.56 billion units and an average gas price of 18.59 Gwei indicate substantial demand for transaction processing, reflecting active network utilization.
  - **Transaction Success Rate and Value Transferred:** A high success rate of 98.2% and a total value transferred exceeding 2.696 × 10²¹ wei (approximately 2.696 million ETH) suggest reliable network performance and significant capital movement, underpinning investor confidence.
  
**3. Balancing Short-Term Risks and Long-Term Potential:**
- **Cautious Optimism:** While short-term indicators point to bearish sentiment influenced by macroeconomic factors and market-wide sell-offs, the underlying on-chain data and ongoing technological developments present a bullish case for Ethereum's future.
- **Potential for Recovery and Growth:** The strong network activity and successful transaction metrics imply resilience and sustained demand, which could facilitate a rebound once broader market conditions stabilize.

**Conclusion:**
Given the current bearish short-term market conditions influenced by Bitcoin's sell-off and notable ETH liquidation by key individuals, a cautious approach is advisable in the immediate term. However, the robust on-chain activity, high network utilization, and significant investments in technological advancements like the IBC protocol position Ethereum favorably for long-term growth. Therefore, holding existing ETH positions with a cautious long bias is recommended, allowing for participation in potential future appreciation while being mindful of short-term volatility.

**Trading Analysis Reasoning:**

The recent news involving Donald Trump's sale of $2.4 million in Ethereum, coupled with his critical remarks labeling cryptocurrency as a "disaster waiting to happen," presents several factors that could influence Ethereum's (ETH) market dynamics. Here's a detailed reasoning to inform potential trading actions:

1. **Influence of High-Profile Figures:**
   - **Market Sentiment Impact:** As a former U.S. President, Donald Trump's statements carry significant weight and can sway public opinion and investor confidence. His negative portrayal of cryptocurrency may lead to decreased enthusiasm among retail and institutional investors.
   - **Perception of Legitimacy:** Criticism from a prominent figure can cast doubts on the legitimacy and future prospects of cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting long-term investment appetite.

2. **Selling Pressure Due to Asset Liquidation:**
   - **Increased Supply:** Trump's sale of $2.4 million in ETH adds liquidity to the market. If other holders perceive this as a signal to exit, it could amplify selling pressure.
   - **Short-Term Price Decline:** The influx of ETH from such large sales, especially from influential individuals, can temporarily depress prices due to the sudden increase in supply against existing demand.

3. **Investor Behavior and Herd Mentality:**
   - **Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD):** Negative remarks can trigger FUD among investors, leading to panic selling or reluctance to enter new positions.
   - **Herd Following:** Investors often follow the actions of influential figures. Trump's sale may prompt others to mimic his behavior, exacerbating market downturns.

4. **Broader Cryptocurrency Market Impact:**
   - **Ripple Effect on Altcoins:** Ethereum is a major cryptocurrency; its decline can influence the broader crypto market, potentially dragging down other altcoins.
   - **Regulatory Scrutiny:** High-profile criticisms can reignite calls for stricter regulations, increasing uncertainty and affecting market stability.

5. **Technical Analysis Considerations:**
   - **Support and Resistance Levels:** A significant sell-off can test key support levels. If breached, it might signal further downward momentum.
   - **Volume Indicators:** Increased selling volume typically confirms bearish trends, suggesting sustained price declines.

6. **Historical Context:**
   - **Past Reactions to Negative News:** Historically, ETH has shown vulnerability to negative sentiment, often leading to short-term price corrections followed by recoveries once sentiment stabilizes.

**Trading Suggestions Based on Analysis:**

1. **Short-Term Bearish Positioning:**
   - **Sell or Short ETH:** Given the immediate negative sentiment and potential for increased selling pressure, initiating short positions or selling existing ETH holdings could capitalize on anticipated price declines.
   
2. **Risk Management Strategies:**
   - **Implement Stop-Loss Orders:** Protect against unexpected market reversals by setting stop-loss levels to minimize potential losses.
   - **Diversify Portfolio:** Reduce exposure to ETH by reallocating funds to less volatile assets or stablecoins to safeguard capital.

3. **Hedging:**
   - **Use Derivatives:** Engage in options or futures contracts to hedge against anticipated declines, providing a cushion against market volatility.

4. **Monitoring and Reassessment:**
   - **Stay Informed:** Continuously monitor market reactions, additional statements from influential figures, and broader economic indicators to adjust strategies promptly.
   - **Technical Indicators Watch:** Keep an eye on key technical levels and indicators to identify optimal entry and exit points.

5. **Long-Term Perspective:**
   - **Potential Buying Opportunity Post-Correction:** If the market overreacts and ETH's price significantly dips beyond fundamental valuations, it might present a long-term buying opportunity once negative sentiments subside.

**Conclusion:**

The combination of a prominent figure's asset liquidation and negative remarks can adversely affect Ethereum's market in the short term. Traders should consider bearish strategies, implement robust risk management, and remain vigilant for signs of market stabilization or overcorrection to optimize trading actions based on this analysis.

You are an experienced eth cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading eth. In each day, you must make an action to buy or sell eth. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
Analyzing the recent Ethereum data, the opening price of $2,241.75 is supported by robust network activity, evidenced by 577,757 unique addresses and over 1.08 million total transactions. The substantial total gas used at approximately 107.56 billion units, coupled with an average gas price of around 18.59 Gwei, indicates strong demand for transaction processing and network utilization. With a high success rate of nearly 98.2% for transactions and a significant total value transferred exceeding 2.696 × 10²¹ wei (approximately 2.696 million ETH), the metrics suggest increasing investor engagement and transactional volume. Statistically, these indicators point towards a bullish trend for Ethereum, underpinned by growing user activity and sustained demand, though attention should be paid to potential fluctuations in gas prices that could impact overall network dynamics.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
Recent developments in the Ethereum market present a mixed outlook for investors. Former President Donald Trump has sold over 1,000 ETH, amounting to approximately $2.4 million, during a period when Ethereum had previously seen significant gains, including a 17% increase in the month leading up to the sale. Despite these individual transactions, the broader crypto market is currently under pressure due to a Bitcoin sell-off, causing Ethereum to decline by 14% over the past week alongside other major cryptocurrencies like Solana and AVAX. On a positive front, Polymer Labs has secured $23 million in Series A funding to implement the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol on Ethereum, aiming to enhance blockchain interoperability and potentially drive future growth. Overall, while short-term market sentiment appears bearish due to macroeconomic factors, ongoing technological advancements and funding initiatives like Polymer Labs’ efforts may support Ethereum’s long-term prospects.

1. **Reasoning:**
   The On-Chain Analyst Report highlights strong Ethereum fundamentals with robust network activity and increasing user engagement, suggesting a bullish outlook. Conversely, the News Analyst Report presents a mixed scenario: significant ETH sell-offs by a high-profile figure (Donald Trump) and a broader market decline due to Bitcoin's sell-off indicate short-term bearish pressure. However, positive developments like Polymer Labs securing funding for technological advancements offer long-term growth potential. The Reflection Analyst emphasizes the negative sentiment from Trump's actions, which could exacerbate short-term market hesitancy.

2. **Factual vs Subjective Weighting:**
   - **Factual Information:** 0.6
     - Strong on-chain metrics and technological advancements provide a solid foundation for Ethereum's potential.
   - **Subjective Information:** 0.4
     - Negative sentiment from influential figures and current market pressure cannot be ignored as they impact immediate investor behavior.
   
   *Justification:* Balancing robust on-chain data with the significant short-term sentiment risks ensures a nuanced approach aimed at maximizing returns while acknowledging potential headwinds.

3. **Risk Management:**
   Given the conflicting signals, I will employ a conservative position sizing strategy, limiting exposure to mitigate potential short-term declines. Additionally, I will set stop-loss orders to protect against unexpected market downturns influenced by negative sentiment. Diversifying holdings to include assets less affected by Ethereum-specific news may also help manage overall portfolio risk.
