        "content": "Grayscale: Ethereum\u2019s Rally Mainly Due to Dencun Upgrade, Not Spot ETFs\n\nWhile the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF has been cited as a reason for Ethereum's recent price increase, Grayscale Investments offers a different perspective. In a recent report, the asset manager suggests the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13, 2024, is the true driver behind the surge.\n\nGrayscale analyst William Ogden Moore argues that the market anticipates the upgrade's ability to improve transaction throughput and cost reduction, making Ethereum more competitive with faster blockchains like Solana. While bullish on Ethereum, the report acknowledges the cryptocurrency's underperformance compared to its sector in 2023, particularly against Solana's impressive 900% growth.\n\nThis bullish stance from Grayscale might be influenced by their ongoing efforts to convert their Ethereum trust into a spot Ethereum ETF. With spot Bitcoin ETFs already approved, some predict similar approval for the Ethereum equivalent by May 2024.\n\nBeyond Dencun and potential ETF approval, Grayscale also highlights \"net deflationary supply\" and \"network revenue generation\" as factors contributing to Ethereum's future. Additionally, the report emphasizes Ethereum's potential to recapture lost ground in the smart contract application market. They believe that by becoming more competitive in throughput and cost, Ethereum can attract applications requiring high levels of security and censorship resistance, such as stablecoins and tokenized financial assets."

        "content": "Ethereum price is confronting the upper boundary of the ascending parallel channel after multiple attempted breakouts.\n\nETH could make a 6% climb to $3,200 as bulls continue to show up.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated if the PoS\u2019s token breaks and closes below $2,572.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price consolidation within the ascending parallel channel has lasted since October, with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token making multiple attempts to breakout. As it stands, Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) with double the gains.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Possible start of a trend reversal for BTC\n\nEthereum price eyes $3,200\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is up almost 3% in the last 24 hours to trade for $3,015 as of publishing time. The PoS token broke out above the ascending parallel channel, with prospects for more gains as the ETH bulls continue to show up.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is teasing with a buy signal, pending execution when the RSI crosses above the signal line (yellow band). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also above its signal line (orange band), with histogram bars flashing green in positive territory.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see the Ethereum price shatter the $3, blockade, clearing this range high with a possible extension to the forecasted target, $3,200, standing 6% above current levels.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Ethereum price could extend a neck high to the $3,500 milestone, last tested on April 5, 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, a rejection from the upper boundary of the channel could see ETH price plummet, squatting below the immediate support at $2,905.\n\nAn extended fall could see Ethereum price slip below the midline of the channel, with the possibility of retesting the midline of the market range, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,572. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\n(This article was corrected on February 25 at 14:05 GMT to say, in the second bullet point, that Ethereum could make a 6% climb to $3,200, not $32,000.)"

        "content": "A closely followed analyst believes investors will have one last chance to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at lower levels before the markets witness the next bull phase.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Rager tells his 199,300 followers on the social media platform X that he\u2019s keeping some capital on the sidelines in anticipation of one more pullback.\n\nAccording to Rager, Bitcoin and Ethereum might see a correction around the April halving, when the rewards of BTC miners get cut in half.\n\n\u201cHolding spot in positions and waiting for the BTC and ETH pullback in the next couple of months to buy around halving.\n\nThat will be the last great opportunity for this cycle.\u201d\n\nLooking closer at Bitcoin, Rager thinks that BTC is primed for a short-lived pullback. According to the analyst, his expected retracement will set the stage for Bitcoin to rally above $60,000.\n\n\u201cThe uptrend from the bottom has been primarily composed of a few days of strong price action followed by a lot of chop and pullbacks.\n\nThe one time period with sustained grinding up without substantial pullback was from October to January where we saw the BTC spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) approval [being] front run.\n\nBitcoin and the market in general have a lot of upside opportunities coming but could be due for a short-term pullback. After a pullback and people flip/flop bearish, it\u2019s likely we see another burst to the upside to break $60,000 for the first time since 2021.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $51,683.\n\nAs for Ethereum, Rager thinks that the native asset of the top smart contract platform is poised to move higher.\n\n\u201cThe question is how long can ETH stay above $3,000 this time?\n\nThe target remains $3,500 for this run-up, and with the ETH spot ETF talk, I think we can hit this sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is worth $3,031.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
