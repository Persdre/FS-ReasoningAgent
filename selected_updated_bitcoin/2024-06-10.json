        "content": "Ryan Rasmussen, a senior researcher at Bitwise Asset Management, has noted that Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, managed to generate more revenue than major public companies of the likes of Etsy, Yelp, and Reddit in the first quarter of 2021 .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum generated more revenue than Robinhood, Etsy, Yelp and Reddit in Q1 2024.\n\n\n\nProbably nothing. https://t.co/OYYWrYvdZx \u2014 Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) June 10, 2024\n\nAccording to data provided by Coin98 Analytics, Ethereum achieved record transaction fee revenue of roughly $1.2 billion. This marked a 79% increase compared to the previous quarter.\n\nEthereum's transaction fees recorded a significant uptick in March due to the major market rally that took place during that month. Bitcoin hit its current all-time high of $73,737 while the flagship altcoin also approached its all-time peak of $4,878 which was logged more than two years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEther is likely to end the second quarter on a high note as well due to the approval of spot exchange-traded funds in the U.S.\n\n$22K by the end of the decade?\n\nAmerican investment management firm VanEck recently predicted that the price of the leading altcoin could potentially reach a whopping $22,000 by the end of this decade.\n\nFor Ether to achieve this pie-in-the-sky target, the network has to become cheaper and more efficient.\n\nLast year, VanEck predicted that Ethereum's revenue could potentially grow to $51 billion on an annual rate in 2030, which is its base case. Its bull case is $136 billion.\n\nThe company counts transaction fees, including the tip fee, as a revenue line.\n\nVanEck has also predicted that Ethereum could end up becoming a store-of-value asset, evolving beyond merely a transactional currency. This could potentially add \u201cSecurity as a Service\u201d (SaaS) as a new revenue item."

        "content": "Following the recent approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs last month, one analyst has predicted that the investment vehicle will capture as much as 20% of Spot Bitcoin ETF flows. Indeed, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex\u2019s head of derivatives, Jag Kooner, predicted the performance of the ETH offering.\n\nBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin represent the only two crypto-based ETFs in the United States. Moreover, since its approval in January, BTC has had one of the most successful exchange-traded products in the country\u2019s history. Now, there is the expectation that Ethereum could capture a fifth of the flows going into the Bitcoin offering.\n\nSource: Watcher.Guru\n\nAlso Read: Can Ethereum ETFs Garner High Demand Like Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nEthereum ETF to Capture 10%\u201320% of Bitcoin ETF Flows\n\nWith the midpoint of 2024 fast approaching, the year has seen the digital asset sector climb to the forefront. Dominating discussions within finance, crypto-based ETFs have been a massive part of the ongoing discourse. As the second such opinion prepares to go live, the market is observing what its debut could look like.\n\nMoreover, they are beginning to question what effect its debut could have on the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. With Bitcoin proving to be immensely successful just five months after its launch, the presence of a secondary offering has undoubtedly become a point of interest.\n\nAccording to one expert, the recently approved Spot Ethereum ETFs could capture a significant portion of Bitcoin ETF flows. Specifically, Bitfinex Jag Kooner noted that the offering could acquire as much as a fifth of the overall flows into the digital asset investment offering.\n\nSource: Blockchain Reporter\n\nAlso Read: $438B Asset Manager Susquehanna Buys $1.3B In Bitcoin ETFs\n\n\u201cForecasts show that spot Ethereum ETFs could capture between 10 and 20% of the flows that have been going into spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Kooner told The Block. \u201cThe launch of gold ETFs offers a historical parallel, as when new gold ETFs were introduced, they attracted significant investment,\u201d Kooner added.\n\nThe debut of those new gold ETFs, historically, affected the inflows in investment products that already existed. Kooner remarked, \u201cSimilarly, the introduction of Ethereum ETFs could see fund managers reallocating resources to balance their exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d"

        "content": "All eyes are on spot Ethereum ETFs. SEC\u2019s surprising turn of events last month has prompted a surge in addresses holding large amounts of ETH during the period.\n\nSuch a trend could potentially hint at a much-needed revival for the world\u2019s largest altcoin, which has been struggling to surpass the $4,000 resistance level.\n\nWealthy Investors Accumulate ETH\n\nThere has been a 3% rise in the number of Ethereum addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH over the last three weeks. This metric is seen as an indicator of rising institutional investment and accumulation by Ethereum whales and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Ali Martinez tweeted,\n\n\u201cThe number of #Ethereum addresses holding 10,000+ $ETH has increased by 3% in the last three weeks, signaling an important spike in buying pressure!\u201d\n\nAs such, a spike in addresses with large ETH holdings suggests increasing buying pressure and demand from deep-pocketed investors. This could potentially be an upcoming bull run for Ethereum as whale accumulating supply is often a precursor to an uptick in asset prices.\n\nThis comes a month after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a landmark decision to approve spot Ethereum ETF. The financial watchdog granted permission for a total of eight separate ETF products tracking Ethereum proposed by Grayscale, VanEck, ARK Invest, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, BlackRock, 21Shares, and Invesco Galaxy.\n\nThese listings will enable traditional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through regulated investment vehicles and are also expected to unlock new capital inflow while simultaneously boosting its mainstream accessibility and liquidity. Hence, whales are bullish on the development as evidenced by the resulting accumulating activity.\n\nEthereum Scarcer Than Bitcoin on Exchanges\n\nFurther validating this trend is Glassnode data, which shows that centralized exchanges are experiencing a supply crunch for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Only 11.73% of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply and an even lower 10.56% of Ethereum\u2019s supply remain on major exchanges.\n\nThis indicates that investors are withdrawing and holding their cryptocurrencies off exchanges, further signaling an accumulation trend.\n\nWhen supply on exchanges dries up, it can create upward price pressure as the remaining liquidity gets absorbed by buyers. Interestingly, Ethereum appears to be even scarcer than Bitcoin on exchanges currently."
