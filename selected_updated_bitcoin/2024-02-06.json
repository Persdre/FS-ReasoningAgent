        "content": "The asset managers filed for an Ether spot ETF with the SEC in September last year.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested public comments on a proposed rule change to list and trade an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) from investment firms Galaxy Digital and Invesco, according to a filing published today.\n\nThe ETF, called the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, aims to track the spot price of Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nThe SEC published the proposal in the Federal Register on November 8, 2023, and has now instituted proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the listing.\n\nIn its proposal, the SEC outlined several areas where it is seeking feedback, including whether the ETF is properly filed under the Exchange\u2019s rules for commodity-based trust shares, and whether arguments made for listing Bitcoin ETFs apply equally well to an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\n\u201cDo commenters agree that arguments to support the listing of Bitcoin ETPs apply equally to the Shares? Are there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d the SEC queried in its request.\n\nThe regulator also asked for views on whether the proposed ETF would be susceptible to manipulation given the nature of the Ethereum market.\n\nOther questions covered topics like the liquidity and transparency of Ether markets, potential surveillance-sharing agreements with trading platforms like Coinbase, and the correlation between Ether spot and futures prices.\n\nInterested parties have until February 27, 2024, to submit comments on the proposed rule change. The SEC will then review the feedback as it decides whether to greenlight Galaxy and Invesco\u2019s Ethereum ETF."

        "content": "While U.S. regulators deliberate on spot Ethereum ETFs, Europe and Canada already boast billions in spot and futures ETH-related products.\n\nPer a Coingecko study, Europe dominates the global Ethereum (ETH) ETF scene with an 81.4% market share. The area has 13 ETH-backed ETFs split across spot products and futures funds, amounting to $4.6 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nCanada is also a big market for ETH ETFs and commands a 16.6% market share of $949 million in AUM. ETFs have also become a gateway into crypto for many Canadian investors. Local regulators introduced stricter measures on crypto companies, leading to an exodus of exchanges like Binance and Bitstamp.\n\nGlobal ETH ETF AUM stood at $5.7 billion as of Feb. 2, spread over 27 ETFs featuring both spot and futures funds. European Ethereum ETFs have traded since 2017, when Grayscale launched its ETH trust (ETHE). However, Grayscale\u2019s fund was excluded from the study due to its close-ended structure.\n\nThe company was engaged with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over converting ETHE to a spot Ethereum ETF, but a decision was delayed till May, crypto.news reported.\n\nGlobal Ethereum ETFs markets | Source: CoinGecko\n\nYou might also like: Standard Chartered foresees Ethereum ETF approval by May 23\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S.\n\nFollowing approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the U.S., SEC chair Gary Gensler stressed that Ethereum-based products may not receive the same treatment. Gensler has repeatedly reiterated that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities and must register with the SEC.\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s loss to Grayscale in court and the eventual approval of spot BTC ETFs on Jan. 10 may better the chances of a green light for spot ETH funds. A U.S. court found that the SEC\u2019s denial of spot crypto products while allowing futures-based ETFs was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also said Ethereum ETF approvals will not be the same as the Bitcoin counterpart, where a court ruling was required to cajole the securities watchdog into reassessing its decision.\n\nIn the interim, several spot ETH ETFs have been delayed until the second quarter of 2024, including bids from issuers like Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy."
