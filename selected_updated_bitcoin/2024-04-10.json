        "title": "Ethereum spot ETF faces skepticism as SEC's decision looms - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "VanEck is bracing for a potential rejection.\n\nShare this article\n\nSeveral applications for spot Ethereum ETFs are pending SEC approval. As the decision date approaches, uncertainty grows, with financial and crypto leaders expressing a mix of skepticism and hope.\n\nA recent report from Barron\u2019s suggests an ongoing, frustrating situation for exchange-trade fund (ETF) issuers.\n\nAccording to Barron\u2019s, unlike the open dialogue that paved the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs, the conversation between the issuers and the SEC around Ethereum ETFs seems more one-sided. This lack of engagement foreshadows a rocky road for Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cSome ETF issuers have met with the SEC to talk about their products, but so far, those discussions have largely been one-sided, without the agency giving the companies the critical feedback needed to finalize their products, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d wrote Barron\u2019s. \u201cAt this point in the Bitcoin ETF process, the issuers were already engaged in a robust back-and-forth with agency staff.\u201d\n\nWhile Barron\u2019s is skeptical, JPMorgan believes the question is \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block that a spot Ethereum ETF approval might still occur, but it would take longer than expected.\n\nAccording to him, ETF companies may initiate legal lawsuits against the agency if the SEC doesn\u2019t approve these filings. \u201cIf there is no spot Ethereum ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be a litigation process after May,\u201d said Panigirtzoglou.\n\nPanigirtzoglou suggested that the lawsuit will likely end up in opposition to the SEC, and just like what happened with Grayscale, the SEC would eventually be \u201cforced\u201d to approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nVanEck, one of the spot Ethereum fund issuers, projects an outright rejection of the ETF filings. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said in an interview with CNBC that the applications of VanEck and Ark Invest \u201care kind of the first in line for May\u2026to probably be rejected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,\u201d said van Eck.\n\n\u201c576 to one\u201d\n\nFor many fund managers, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement is a nerve-wracking waiting game. BlackRock, however, might be more accustomed to this process.\n\nBlackRock has a history of 576 ETF approvals with only 1 rejection. This high success rate creates a positive outlook for the asset manager\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nRecently, Ethereum has drawn attention after news that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation by an undisclosed state authority surfaced. Speculations suggest that this scrutiny, possibly from the SEC, aims to classify Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, as a security.\n\nDespite these speculations, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if ETH is classified as a security.\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, suggested BlackRock\u2019s possible application for withdrawal. He noted BlackRock\u2019s history of successful ETF approvals is attributed to a collaborative approach with the SEC, not just forceful tactics.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC asks Blackrock and the other ETH ETF sponsors to withdraw (a common practice), I bet they will,\u201d commented Chervinsky."
