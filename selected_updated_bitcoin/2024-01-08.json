        "content": "A closely followed trader says that crypto whales are rapidly accumulating the leading smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAnalyst Ali Martinez tells his 39,700 followers on the social media platform X that deep-pocketed crypto traders have purchased 410,000 ETH, worth about $1 billion, in just the last month.\n\nThe trader shares a chart suggesting that the amount of Ethereum held in wallets with one million to 10 million ETH has been steadily rising since early December.\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,219 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.\n\nMoving on to layer-2 scaling solution Polygon (MATIC), Martinez says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which aims to identify turning points in a market with a value of nine signaling a possible reversal, is flashing a bullish signal for the altcoin.\n\n\u201cPolygon: the TD Sequential presents a buy signal on MATIC four-hour chart. A spike in buying pressure around the current levels could see MATIC rebound, potentially toward $0.88, and even as high as $0.96.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, MATIC is worth $0.781.\n\nWrapping up his analysis with crypto king Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says he remains bullish on the top digital asset as long it stays above its immediate support level.\n\n\u201cAs long as Bitcoin maintains its position above $41,800, the outlook remains bullish. This crucial level is bolstered by 2.41 million addresses holding over one million BTC, forming a substantial support zone.

        "content": "The crypto market observed a strong recovery over the last 24 hours, with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trading in the green. While Bitcoin had fallen below $43,310 earlier today, the OG cryptocurrency has now zoomed past $44,000 levels.\n\nLast week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a \u201cFear of Missing Out\u201d warning to investors amid renewed speculation that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will get the regulator\u2019s nod this week. While the SEC warning briefly caused turbulence in the market, the pessimism was short-lived.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price rose 0.5% over the last 24 hours to $44,210, sending its market cap soaring to $865.2 billion. Trading volumes over the last 24 hours jumped over 28% to $21 billion.\n\nHowever, Ethereum saw a 0.3% decline in its prices over the last 24 hours. As of writing, the ETH price stood at $2,277, with its market cap sliding to $267.8 billion. However, trading volumes surged over 29% to $7.7 billion over the last 24 hours.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also bled, with BNB price falling over 3%, Solana (SOL) price sliding over 3%, XRP slipping over 1.3%, and Cardano (ADA) plummetting over 4.6%.\n\nMeanwhile, the global crypto market cap fell nearly 0.9% over the last 24 hours to $1.64 trillion. The fear and greed index score stood at 67, indicating investor sentiment was muted.\n\nTop 3 Cryptos For Today\n\nPepe Coin Price Falls Over 10%\n\nPepe\u2019s price plummetted over 10% to $0.000001062 in the past 24 hours, wiping out a significant chunk of its market cap, which shrank to $447.3 million. However, trading volumes over the last 24 hours rose over 26% to %85.1 million.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Falls 8%\n\nThe Shiba Inu meme coin saw its prices sliding by over 8% to $0.0000088 in the past 24 hours, with its market cap falling to $5.2 billion. Trading volumes over the last 24 hours, however, appreciated over 46% to $170.8 million, indicating growing retail interest in the meme coin.\n\nLido DAO (LDO) Price Slumps 8.5%\n\nAfter a magnificent rally of 14% last week, Lido DAO\u2019s price plunged over 8.5% to $2.85, sending its market cap tumbling to $2.53 billion. Meanwhile, trading volumes over the last 24 hours declined by 16% to $176.4 million, signaling diminishing retail interest in the token.\n\nAlso Read: Blackrock Positions $2B for Imminent US Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital Jumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC could approve the world's first spot Bitcoin ETF later this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday as investors anticipate the first potential approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.30%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) later this week. In particular, the SEC is widely expected to issue a favorable determination for Ark Invest's 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application before Wednesday.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin surged 6.7% by the end of the regular trading day, after briefly exceeding the $47,000 milestone for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum (ETH 0.01%) is also up more than 6%, while Marathon Digital (MARA -1.31%) -- a crypto mining firm whose fortunes tend to ebb and flow with the price of Bitcoin -- rose as much as 10.5% this morning before settling to close up 7.7%.\n\nCrypto investors have marked their calendars for Jan. 10\n\nThe price of Bitcoin alone has nearly tripled over the past year. But its rally more recently gained steam back in October 2023 after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order that had prevented crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. When the D.C. Circuit of Appeals subsequently formalized Grayscale's court win the following week, the onus moved back to the SEC to move forward with its approval processes for several other pending spot ETF applications from providers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest.\n\nFast-forward to today's rally -- and as I noted back in October -- the first of those deadlines happens to be this Wednesday, Jan. 10. That's specifically the date by which the SEC must approve or deny Ark Invest's open application for its \"21Shares\" Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is a big deal for the crypto market as a whole because ETFs would be a much more accessible medium for investors to put their money to work in cryptocurrency assets, at least compared to setting up a separate crypto account or wallet with a crypto-specific broker. ETF shares can also be bought and sold throughout the trading day through virtually any broker, similar to publicly traded stocks.\n\nExpect several spot Bitcoin ETF approvals at once\n\nFew expect Ark Invest's 21Shares to be the only spot Bitcoin ETF to receive approval this week, however.\n\nThe SEC could technically approve or deny each individual spot Bitcoin ETF application as their respective deadlines arrive in the coming months. But that would also effectively mean the earliest to receive approvals enjoy a so-called \"first-mover\" advantage, with the lion's share of investors' capital flowing into those early spot Bitcoin ETFs right away. That would be a massive windfall for those ETF providers, considering some estimates indicate the approval of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially increase the value of the overall crypto market by more than $1 trillion.\n\nInstead, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications in tandem with the Ark Invest 21Shares deadline this week. This scenario has been repeatedly supported by industry watchers observing several hopeful ETF providers simultaneously filing amended registration statements with the SEC over the past few months. Indeed, just last week crypto news site Cointelegraph reported that Ark 21Shares, VanEck Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Fidelity's spot Bitcoin ETF each filed new 8-A Forms with the SEC to register their shares as securities listed on multiple exchanges, indicating they're in the late stages of approval.\n\nThat said, investors shouldn't ignore the risk (however unlikely at this stage) that the SEC might deny those multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications this week. The SEC previously rejected Ark's proposal almost exactly one year ago, for example, citing a lack of measures \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts.\" If the regulatory body offers any similar unexpected opposition this time, I would be shocked if assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Marathon Digital didn't experience a sharp pullback as crypto investors took their recent profits off the table."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could ascend to $50,000 if SEC greenlights spot BTC ETF.\n\nEthereum price readies for a possible 10% climb to $2,500 amid rising momentum and a weakening downtrend.\n\nRipple price finds support at $0.5442, recovery rally in the works as altcoin hopes rest on SEC decision.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains broadly bullish, though not to its full potential, as it could spring higher on chatter about regulator approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Altcoins, starting with Ethereum (ETH) price and Ripple (XRP) price, are also poised for a positive move, with all hopes pegged to the decision expected this week from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETF could see SEC greenlight, Grayscale Investments files amended S-3 sets 1.5% fee\n\nBitcoin eyes $50,000 amid spot ETF-related optimism\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to intertwine itself with the midline of the weekly supply zone at $43,860 but could break out soon as spot ETF developments approach a deadline. The king of cryptocurrency\u2019s price has strong support provided by the 25-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at $43,130 and $41,391, respectively. The inclination of these moving averages to the north show it is the path with the least resistance.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also tipping north, showing rising momentum. Increased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price make a decisive move above the critical threshold of $43,860, before an extension to the next critical range at $48,000.\n\nOnce Bitcoin price overcomes the $48,000 steeple, it could make a quick run to the $50,000 psychological level before potential profit booking. However, traders keeping their profit appetite in check could set the pace for BTC to reach the highly ambitious target of $60,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if early profit booking commences, instigated either by a rejection from the SEC or a delay in the decision, Bitcoin price could descend. Such a move could see it break below the 25 and 50-day EMAs before testing the confluence between the 100-day EMA and the horizontal line near the $37,800 level.\n\nHowever, for the prevailing bullish outlook to be invalidated, Bitcoin price must close below the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast, Analyzing possible short-term implication of probable spot ETF approval on BTC price\n\nEthereum price coils up for a 10% climb\n\nEthereum (ETH) price remains within the confines of an ascending parallel channel, with the final retest of the lower boundary of the channel possibly precipitating a 10% climb to $2,500. The RSI is moving north, evidence of rising momentum, accentuated by the falling Average Directional Index (ADX), showing that the slump that saw ETH value drop is losing strength.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price shatter the $2,388 resistance, before clearing the $2,445 range high as it heads to the forecasted $2,500 target. A strong jolt past this level could see ETH market value reach $3,000.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if profit takers pull the trigger, Ethereum price could roll over, potentially losing the support at $2,135. Below this level, the cliff could send Ether to the depths of $2,000, or in a dire case, invalidate the bullish outlook by breaking and closing below $1,935.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price could target $3,000 with ETH whales buying the dip\n\nRipple price could scale a recovery with $0.5442 support holding\n\nRipple (XRP) price may have bottomed out after the $0.5442 support came into play. The RSI edging north points to rising momentum, whereas the ADX indicator rising suggests a strengthening trend.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see Ripple price overcome the critical support at $0.5784, potentially going as high as to breach the resistance due to the descending trendline and collecting sell-side liquidity around the $0.7000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders who got wrecked during the January 2 crash choose to exit the market after breaking even, XRP price could drop, with a break below the $0.5442 support exposing Ripple price to a cliff. This would expose further downside as low as the midline of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $0.5002. A break and close below this level would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple price likely to bounce 20% as balance restores in the XRP market"
