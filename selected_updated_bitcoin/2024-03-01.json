        "title": "Ethereum ETF in 2024? Top Crypto Lawyer Pessimistic - U.Today",
        "content": "The U.S. watchdog SEC received too many \"political blowbacks\" after having Bitcoin spot ETFs approved in the United States, seasoned legal expert says. As such, the most anticipated event for Ethereum (ETH) investors might be months away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Political priorities\" can prevent ETH ETF from being green-lit in 2024\n\nThe U.S. SEC is unlikely to approve exchange-traded funds based on spot Ether (ETH) in 2024, Variant's Jake Chervinsky says. This sad outcome is caused by political reasons that put the SEC leadership under pressure.\n\nI am a lot less confident about ETH ETF approval this year than many of you are.\n\n\n\nThe SEC got a ton of political blowback for approving BTC ETFs, even though the court basically forced it to.\n\n\n\nNow animal spirits are in control of the market, and an ETH ETF would only add to that. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) March 1, 2024\n\nEven though the U.S. court basically forced the SEC to authorize the Bitcoin spot ETFs launch in January 2023, the regulator received strong \"political blowback,\" Chervinsky added.\n\nIn this situation, the BTC ETFs approval is the fruit of collaboration between the SEC and ETFs applications, especially BlackRock.\n\nAs such, they will do their utmost to avoid conflict with the SEC and, most likely, will withdraw all ETH ETF applications should the SEC ask them to do so.\n\nThe context becomes even more hostile for Ether ETF given the fact that \"animal spirits\" took full control over the markets now.\n\n\"When, not if\" approach still valid\n\nSince the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, added over 30% in price. Last week, it peaked over $3,500.\n\nHowever, Chervinsky is sure that ETH ETFs will be approved sooner or later:\n\n\u201cWhen, not if\u201d seems like a very reasonable take to me\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Bloomberg's James Seyffart announced that he did not expect Ether ETF to go live in March 2024."

The upcoming Dencun upgrade will lower fees, but there is a caveat.\n\nEthereum users are struggling with high gas fees as usage increases on the network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s renaissance\n\nand a\n\nspectacular rally\n\nin cryptocurrency prices is making life difficult for users of the Ethereum network.\n\nAs user demand and interest in both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) surges\u2014on the back of the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US and the potential approval of spot ether ETFs \u2014 gas prices on Ethereum are spiraling out of control.\n\nAt peak times, users are reporting paying over $100 in transaction fees for swaps, which is the exchange of one crypto token for another on the network.

Respectively, they\u2019ve earned $2.5 million and $1.4 million in fees within the last 24 hours, per Etherscan data.\n\n400 fucking dollars to migrate .1 ETH to Blast mainnet. It's so over. Pack it up. Ethereum is unusable today. pic.twitter.com/hZRrwRAMlz \u2014 Pop Punk (@PopPunkOnChain) February 29, 2024\n\nThe high transaction fees once again draw attention to Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges and how difficult it can be to onboard new users to the network during times of increased interest.\n\nEthereum is not blind to these issues, which continue to reoccur in bull market cycles. Ethereum has an ambitious multi-year roadmap to reduce transaction fees, increase security, and future proof the network.\n\nRead more: An Overview of Ethereum Scaling\n\n\u201cEthereum is trying to learn from this mistake of pricing away marginal users to other, cheaper chains,\u201d said Luke Nolan, Ethereum research associate at digital asset investment manager CoinShares. \u201cThe proposed and implemented solution is to scale through layer 2 solutions, mostly rollups.\u201d\n\nTwo key upgrades from the roadmap have already been implemented including \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which was Ethereum\u2019s transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, which enabled the release of staked ether withdrawals. The next major upgrade is Dencun, which is scheduled for March 13.\n\nRead more: What Is the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Update on Ethereum?\n\nOne of the key introductions in the Dencun upgrade is a new transaction type called \u201cblobs.\u201d Ethereum layer 2 rollups currently post data to Ethereum using calldata. This is costly and makes up around 90% of the gas fees that rollups pay to post bundled transactions to the network. After Dencun, layer 2s will post the data to blobs, which are highly optimized and are much cheaper than calldata.\n\n\u201cOverall, yes fees will reduce on Ethereum, but only for layer 2s,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThe general hope here is that layer 2s will become sophisticated enough over time, with seamless UX, high speed and low transaction costs \u2026 In this end state, Ethereum can compete with any new fast chain that comes out of the box because layer 1 continues to be the secure settlement layer, and layer 2 becomes the data availability layer that allows it all to scale to new heights.\u201d\n\nUnder the upgrade, transaction fees on layer 2s will decrease between 10 to 100 times depending on the chain, said Nolan, adding that it could get very close to \u201cSolana-esque transaction fees.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s Surge\n\nThis fee reduction couldn\u2019t come soon enough for many users. Many Ethereum users, particularly those who trade NFTs, are talking about moving to Solana, which is a layer 1 blockchain that offers much cheaper transaction fees.\n\nIt costs 52 dollars to purchase a standard ERC-721 off Blur right now. It costs another 20-30 dollars per marketplace you want to list that NFT on. and that's with gwei relatively low (70) by bull market standards ETH does not make sense for the majority of NFT collections. \u2014 root (@rootslashbin) February 27, 2024\n\nThe average transaction costs for NFTs on Ethereum is around $140, per Etherscan, which is sometimes more than the cost of the actual NFT being traded. While on Solana, the average cost of a transaction is 0.000036 SOL, which is $0.0047, according to data from Solscan.\n\n\u201cAs of the last few months, a lot of attention has shifted to Solana NFTs, which has certainly taken some of Ethereum\u2019s market share,\u201d said Nolan, adding that Ethereum NFT trading is not back to the same transaction volume levels as last year.\n\nMost activity on Ethereum is centering around collections with high floor prices such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and Moonbirds, Nolan said. They have floor prices of $75,000 and $4,000 respectively. In these scenarios, a trader is unlikely to be phased by a $100 transaction fee.\n\nDaily NFT trade volume on Ethereum in millions (CoinShares)\n\n\u201cWhilst on Solana I would venture to say that the activity for smaller collections (as well as big ones) has been picking up because transaction fees are 100x smaller on average and so the smaller value accounts have logically flocked over there,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cIt has made for a much more enjoyable speculative playground for participants.\u201d\n\nWeekly NFT volume on Solana in millions (CoinShares)\n\nThis is echoed by Anastasia Melachrinos, a DeFi product manager at crypto data firm Kaiko, who notes that new users are generally entering the blockchain ecosystem through centralized exchanges or directly via Solana.\n\n\u201cIt is without a doubt that high throughput upgradeable chains like Aptos or Solana will receive most of the non crypto native traffic, which is most of the world in the case mass adoption does take place,\u201d said Sharvin Baindur, chief of staff at investment firm Saison Capital, who focuses on investing and supporting high performance and low cost blockchains.\n\nEven if gas fees on layer 2s are reduced to Solana levels, Nolan notes that Ethereum layer 2s still face challenges around fragmentation and poor user experiences, which can act as a barrier to capturing those smaller value transactions. On the flip side, Ethereum and layer 2s have a strong reputation and a very complete ecosystem, so once the execution cost is fixed the barriers to entry to those chains will be lowered, Melachrinos said."

        "title": "The Evolution of Ethereum: Pioneering the Next Wave of Crypto Progress - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum has been at the forefront of the crypto world ever since its inception in 2013. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether, is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, trailing only behind Bitcoin. Ethereum has also been instrumental in mainstreaming several key trends, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the Metaverse. However, Ethereum community says the network is still far away from unleashing its potential and evolving until they reach the top.\n\nThe decentralized blockchain has even found its way into other walks of life, including gaming, art, and fashion thanks to the timely evolution of Ethereum ecosystem through upgradation. Businesses like online casinos are starting to use the platform to facilitate online transactions and payments. This Ethereum casino partnership has boosted the presence, with a popular resource for using Ethereum and we are seeing an overall increase in the market value of the blockchain and its cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, Ethereum came from a long journey and went through a lot of experiments before reaching the point where it is today. Here is a glimpse of the evolutions of Ethereum that fuel its growth.\n\nUpgrading the System\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum underwent a series of upgrades known collectively as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which successfully transitioned the platform\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. This transition vastly improved Ethereum\u2019s energy efficiency and security, reducing its energy consumption by 99%. Consequently, Ethereum is expected to gain global traction due to its enhanced focus on environmental and sustainability concerns.\n\nThe platform continuously evolves, adapting to market trends and global values. In the coming years, Ethereum plans to implement an update known as Danksharding. This update focuses on horizontal database scaling, aiming to enhance the management and storage of distributed data and increase the software\u2019s scalability.\n\nAs global attitudes and standards around cryptocurrency evolve, so too will Ethereum. Its versatility and unique adaptability enable it to navigate new trends with ease, maintaining its position at the forefront of the crypto world and cementing its status as a leading cryptocurrency.\n\nInnovations and Expansions\n\nEthereum\u2019s commitment to innovation is clear in its roadmap, which includes several significant upgrades beyond Danksharding. These upgrades are designed to improve the network\u2019s scalability, security, and sustainability, ensuring that Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain technology. Many experts believes that such upgrade will play pivotal role in the evolution of Ethereum.\n\nThe introduction of sharding is expected to further decentralize the network, increasing transactions per second and reducing gas fees. This will make the platform more accessible and efficient for users worldwide.\n\nThe Rise of Decentralized Applications (dApps)\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) is one of its most compelling features. These applications utilize Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality to offer a wide range of services, from finance to gaming, without the need for traditional intermediaries.\n\nThe expanding dApp market indicates a shift towards a more decentralized internet, with Ethereum leading the way. As the platform becomes more user-friendly and scalable, the adoption of dApps is expected to increase, potentially revolutionizing industries by promoting transparency, efficiency, and trust.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Role in the Financial Ecosystem\n\nThe DeFi sector, primarily built on Ethereum, demonstrates the platform\u2019s ability to reimagine financial services. From lending and borrowing platforms to stablecoins and tokenized assets, Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem offers permissionless, transparent, and efficient alternatives, challenging the traditional financial sector.\n\nAs the DeFi space matures, it could significantly diminish the market share of conventional financial institutions, positioning Ethereum as the backbone of a new financial paradigm.\n\nAlso Read: How Ethereum Blockchain Is Shaping The Education Sector\n\nSurge In ETH\u2019s Value\n\nOver the coming years, Ether and Ethereum are both set up for positive growth. According to binance, at the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price is $3,481.61. Experts predict this to propel upwards to around $40,000 by the end of 2030. While some remain skeptical of this figure, others point to Ethereum\u2019s scalability, uniqueness, and market range as factors that could make it a reality.\n\nBut will Ethereum eventually overtake Bitcoin as the world\u2019s number-one cryptocurrency? The crypto market is highly volatile and fickle, so it is certainly a possibility.\n\nETH has experienced considerably higher levels of growth in recent years, increasing in value by nearly 400% in 2021 compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 66%. And thanks to Ethereum\u2019s unique decentralized blockchain model, many experts believe it has the potential to outperform Bitcoin within the next ten years.\n\nChallenges and Considerations\n\nDespite its promising future, Ethereum faces several challenges. Scalability issues, high transaction fees, and network congestion have been significant obstacles. However, the ongoing upgrades and the shift towards a more sustainable and efficient framework are expected to mitigate these concerns.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory uncertainties and the competitive landscape of blockchain technologies are factors that could influence Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey is far from over. Its pioneering role in popularizing smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi has set the stage for a future where blockchain technology is integral to various sectors. With continuous upgrades and increasing adoption of its platform, Ethereum is well-positioned to remain a key player in the cryptocurrency space, potentially challenging Bitcoin\u2019s dominance.\n\nThe amalgamation of technological advancements, community support, and a robust ecosystem renders Ethereum\u2019s future not just promising but stellar, envisioning a landscape where innovation, inclusivity, and efficiency are paramount.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored post.
