        "content": "Sun 07 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nA recent survey highlights a fascinating trend: Americans\u2019 interest in Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is on the rise! If the SEC approved the launch of an Ethereum ETF, nearly a quarter of voters would consider investing in this crypto.\n\nEthereum ETF captures the attention of Americans!\n\nThe launch of an Ethereum ETF in the United States could boost investments in digital assets. Although the future of these ETFs is uncertain, their introduction could accelerate the maturity of the crypto market and its widespread adoption.\n\nThe arrival of an Ethereum ETF could broaden the interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. In the crypto market, anticipation is rising around the launch of the Ethereum ETF, likely scheduled for July 15. This crucial step could trigger a wave of investments and mark a historic milestone in the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Experts predict a massive influx of capital, with estimates reaching up to $15 billion in the first few months. If the SEC gives its green light, this event could not only validate Ethereum as a major investment asset but also open the door to a new era of blockchain-based financial products.\n\nETH crypto in free fall!\n\nCrypto is gaining importance among American voters. Since the beginning of the year, a third of likely voters are more receptive to crypto, and 47% believe it will eventually be part of their investment portfolio.\n\nDespite the excitement generated by the imminent launch of Ethereum ETFs, ETH crypto is currently experiencing a significant drop of 1.72% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $3,014. After losing a key support, Ethereum risks falling even further, with short-term forecasts seeing a drop to $2,900.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF represents a major opportunity for the crypto market, attracting the attention of traditional investors and voters. With growing interest in emerging technologies and the anticipation of clear regulation, the future of Ethereum ETFs is promising. It could mark a major turning point in digital investment in the United States.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s latest report suggested U.S voters are more likely to buy ETH after ETF approval\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s value surged on the charts, its network growth fell\n\nThe recent market drawdown has affected a host of cryptocurrencies over the last few days. Needless to say, Ethereum [ETH] was no exception, with its price struggling to break past the $3,000-level, at the time of writing.\n\nWill Ethereum finally see green?\n\nHowever, there may be some hope for Ethereum maximalists, despite the altcoin\u2019s falling prices. A new survey by Grayscale has painted a bullish picture for Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nAccording to the same, when the long-awaited Spot Ethereum ETF goes live, nearly a quarter of potential U.S voters would be more likely to invest in the altcoin. This surge in interest would be in line with the broader trend of crypto adoption too.\n\nThe survey also found that nearly half of all voters, 47% to be precise, now expect to include cryptocurrencies in their investment portfolios \u2013 A significant hike from 40% just six months ago. The large scale interest from people in adding crypto to their portfolios could further help ETH in the long run.\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin\u2019s ETF launch, an Ethereum ETF would provide a familiar, regulated way for new investors to enter the market. This influx of capital, particularly from institutions, could drive up Ethereum\u2019s price due to increased demand. This was seen with Bitcoin, where the ETF approval coincided with a significant price rally.\n\nA U.S-approved Ethereum ETF would be a major vote of confidence from regulators, potentially easing institutional concerns about the cryptocurrency\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,987.46 following a 4.19% hike over the last 24 hours. The network growth for ETH declined materially over the period. This indicated that despite low prices, most new investors have been unwilling to buy ETH.\n\nAdditionally, the velocity around the token also fell, implying reduced frequency of trading for ETH.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nHence, it\u2019s worth anticipating what the final launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs will mean for the altcoin\u2019s price in the future.\n\nOn the other side of the world, it would seem that Hong Kong might soon welcome Ethereum staking ETFs, and within just 6 months too. This, according to Hashkey Capital\u2019s Vivien Wong. In fact, Wong also claimed that local regulators are now talking to industry insiders over the said proposal."
