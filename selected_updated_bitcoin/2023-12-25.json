        "title": "Solana surpasses Bitcoin and Ethereum in weekend trading volume - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Crypto traders\u2019 interest in Solana remains very high as the trading volume for the digital asset surpassed that of Bitcoin and Ethereum on major centralized exchanges during the weekend.\n\nConor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, first pointed out this milestone on Dec. 24, saying SOL saw more trading than the combination of the top two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nRiyad Carey, an analyst with Paris-based crypto intelligence platform Kaiko, further corroborated this finding, saying the same trend was observed on Kraken and Gemini, two of the largest U.S.-based crypto trading platforms.\n\nSOL\u2019s trading volume also beat BTC and ETH on UPbit and MEXC for the past 2 and 3 days, respectively.\n\nCarey further shared a chart showing that SOL\u2019s trading activities, compared to ETH and BTC, were experiencing an uptrend. According to the chart, SOL trading is approaching 40% of trading activities on centralized crypto platforms, while ETH and BTC were declining.\n\nAccording to Carey, these metrics are \u201cunprecedented\u201d and show the sustained interest SOL is currently generating in the market.\n\nWhy SOL volume is rising\n\nOver the past year, Solana has experienced remarkable growth, defying earlier associations with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of the bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Despite this, the network has flourished, attracting an expanding user base.\n\nDuring this period, Solana forged strategic alliances with renowned global financial players like Visa and Shopify. These partnerships harness blockchain technology to streamline payment procedures, showcasing SOL\u2019s network\u2019s potential to a broader global audience.\n\nMoreover, the recent surge in interest surrounding the Solana-based BONK memecoin and the resurgence of decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the smart contract-enabled blockchain have contributed significantly to its recent upward trajectory.\n\nThese developments have helped push the price of SOL to new highs, up more than 800% on the year-to-date metric to nearly $120 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "New data from decentralized finance (DeFi) tracker DeFi Llama reveals that surging altcoin Solana (SOL) is now the top traded digital asset on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) behind Ethereum (ETH).\n\nSolana\u2019s trading DEX volume has soared by more than 25% in the past week for a total of $5.6 billion, catapulting it into the second highest traded digital asset on DEXs, according to DeFi Llama. On December 13th, Solana ranked just fourth by DEX trading volume.\n\nEthereum is the top traded DEX asset with $8.89 billion in trading volume in the past week.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Solana\u2019s DEX trading volume totaled $895.9 million compared to ETH\u2019s 1.07 billion.\n\nSolana is trading for $122.32 at time of writing, a 7.73% gain during the last 24 hours and a massive increase of over 1,000% since the start of the year.\n\nAs the ETH competitor\u2019s value surges, the network is gaining participants. Last week, stablecoin issuer Paxos announced its expansion to the Solana network after exclusively working with the top smart contract platform.\n\nThe New York-based crypto firm will release its dollar-pegged crypto asset, Pax Dollar (USDP), over the Solana blockchain starting January 17th, 2024.\n\nAs stated by Raj Gokal, co-founder of Solana, in a press release,\n\n\u201cPaxos\u2019s decision to bring stablecoin issuance to the Solana blockchain will showcase how Solana\u2019s high-performance network and low transaction fees can support regulated financial products and provide leaders like Paxos new ways to scale and innovate\u201d\n\nSolana has also seen high interest in its Web3 smartphone, Saga, which recently sold out after sales began in April. Buying Saga came with a reward of free Bonk (BONK), a surging meme coin built over Solana.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "An analyst who nailed the end of the 2021 Bitcoin bull market believes that Ethereum (ETH) will rally behind a catalyst that\u2019s been overshadowed by the potential approval of a spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nPseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 727,600 followers on the social media platform X that the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs next year will likely give ETH a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nEarlier this year, multiple asset management firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Hashdex filed applications for spot-based Ethereum ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nPentoshi says that Ethereum will likely generate bullish momentum as market participants anticipate the event.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been bull tweeting the BTC ETF since $25,000-$28,000. Soon, we get to do this all again with the ETH ETF in 2024.\n\nNo matter what you believe, it\u2019s all game theory. As the date approaches, people will be less willing to sell, and others will feel the need to buy. $2,7xx and $3,400 on the table.\u201d\n\nPentoshi is not the only crypto strategist who believes 2024 will be a good year for ETH. Trader Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe tells his 678,200 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is likely in the process of carving a bottom against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC). He shares a chart that shows ETH massively outperforming BTC in the first few months of 2024.\n\n\u201cEthereum isn\u2019t dead. There\u2019s a temporary snapshot of hype taking place that other ecosystems are better.\n\nThey aren\u2019t.\n\nThe best quarter for ETH is the first quarter of the year and that\u2019s approaching.\n\nThree to eight months prior to Bitcoin halving -> bottoming period.\u201d\n\nBased on the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that the ETH/BTC pair will rally toward his target of 0.12 BTC worth $5,243 by April next year. At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.05257 BTC ($2,297).\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
