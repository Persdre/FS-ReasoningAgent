        "title": "If the SEC Thinks Ethereum Is a Security, Are ETH ETFs Doomed? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWill the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF this year?\n\nOptimism among market participants is fading\u2014and now that the SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.\n\n\u201cIf this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,\u201d Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told Decrypt.\n\nThat\u2019s because of a lawsuit filed last week by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security\u2014and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant\u2019s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency\u2019s position on ETH.\n\nWhile the long-term impact of SEC\u2019s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren\u2019t happening\u2014at least, not without another legal fight.\n\nSpot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval for trading in the U.S. market in January\u2014but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, successfully sued the SEC to make it happen.\n\nStill, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts assumed spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval by May 23. By last month, analysts were already cooling on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week\u2019s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go.\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC\u2019s now-evident position on ETH\u2019s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren\u2019t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that\u2019s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said.\n\nYes dif rules, 33 act for commodities \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 29, 2024\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear, though, that the SEC\u2019s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers\u2014at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the first-ever Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told Decrypt that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved.\n\nVan Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved \u201cin time.\u201d\n\nBut he emphasized that Van Eck\u2019s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week\u2019s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.\n\n\u201cThis has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "The SEC has Ethereum in its crosshairs. But does the agency think Ether is a security? - Fortune",
        "content": "For weeks, speculation has mounted that the Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to cross the crypto Rubicon and declare Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, a security. As the deadline looms for a decision on spot Ether ETFs, the move seems like the last option for an agency seemingly determined to find reasons to reject crypto products, even though prior, high-ranking staffers had argued that Ether was a commodity and out of its wheelhouse. The implications would be catastrophic for the broader crypto industry, with even mainstays like Fidelity offering trading services for Ether.\n\nConfirmation appeared to come last Thursday when Consensys\u2014an early developer for Ethereum, and the company behind the popular MetaMask wallet\u2014filed a lawsuit against the SEC, revealing it had received a Wells Notice and had been the subject of a yearlong investigation into Ethereum\u2019s security status. And then, on Monday, Consensys refiled its complaint, unredacting certain sections that had hinted the SEC officially believed Ether to be a security. The smoking gun, it turned out, was a formal order opening an investigation, signed by enforcement director Gurbir Grewal in April 2023, into the possible offers and sales of \u201ccertain securities, including, but not limited to ETH.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited proof was explosive. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has refused to take a stance on Ether\u2019s security status, including under questioning by House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) just a few days after the secret formal order, as well as when I interviewed him last November. Despite that lack of clarity, the SEC allowed the launch of Ether futures ETFs last October, which implies a view that Ether is not an unregistered security. Furthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints. Predictably, the revelation drew rage from the crypto industry and beyond, with McHenry tweeting that Gensler \u201cknowingly misled Congress.\u201d\n\nThe whole situation seemed strange, even by the bizarro standards of the SEC versus crypto war, where reality is often obscured behind layers of bluster and exaggeration. Why would the SEC privately take such an incendiary stance, and share it with one of its main targets, while publicly contradicting itself?\n\nPart of the confusion stems from the significance of a formal order, which, according to the SEC\u2019s enforcement manual, commission staff draft to be reviewed by the enforcement director and serves as the necessary first step to an investigation that empowers staff to subpoena witnesses and take evidence. As Lowenstein Sandler partner Christopher Gerold confirmed, formal orders are not \u201cconclusory,\u201d meaning they do not represent legal conclusions. That, instead, would come as part of a Wells Notice, which informs potential defendants of the end of an investigation.\n\nIn other words, just because the formal order seemed to indicate the SEC\u2019s view that ETH is a security at the beginning of an investigation does not make it the agency\u2019s official stance. That would also provide a more generous explanation as to why Gensler did not take a stance on ETH\u2019s status back in April 2023\u2014it was at the onset of the investigation, with the agency deciding whether it would diverge from the view of earlier commissions. And according to a person familiar with the issue, the Wells Notice received by Consensys this April included no language about ETH being a security.\n\nOf course, that could change if and when the SEC files its lawsuit against Consensys, which will focus on MetaMask\u2019s status as an unregistered broker-dealer, as well as its staking products. The complaint could very well name ETH to be one of the unregistered securities offered by MetaMask. And, as Duke Financial Economics Center lecturing fellow Lee Reiners told me, all indications point to the SEC naming ETH as an unregistered security as a rationale for rejecting Ether ETFs.\n\nStill, contrary to popular opinion amid the crypto industry, the agency has not yet taken the stance. \u201cIt\u2019s premature and inaccurate to claim that the SEC has decided anything at this point,\u201d Reiners said. But don\u2019t be surprised if we finally get an answer in the next few weeks.\n\nLeo Schwartz\n\nleo.schwartz@fortune.com\n\n@leomschwartz\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBinance founder and former CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao was sentenced to four months in federal prison on Tuesday for money laundering violations, despite prosecutors requesting 36 months.
