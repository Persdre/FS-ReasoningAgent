        "title": "Crypto Trader Says Top Ethereum Rival Primed for Massive Bull Run Ahead, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that one Ethereum (ETH) competitor is ripe to witness steep bursts to the upside.\n\nTrader Ali Martinez tells his 61,400 followers on the social media platform X that he is bullish on Cardano (ADA).\n\nAccording to the analyst, ADA \u201cseems ready for a parabolic bull run\u201d after seeing its value drop by about 50% over the past month. Martinez points out that in 2020, Cardano saw an over 50% correction before going on a vertical rally.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, signaling an end to the bear market.\n\nFollowing the stagnant phase, ADA broke out of the channel with a 75% surge, then underwent a 56% price correction, setting the stage for an impressive 4,095% bull run.\u201d\n\nMartinez says that a similar pattern may be playing out this time around.\n\n\u201cRecently, in 2023, something similar happened! Cardano consolidated within a parallel channel, marking an end to the bear market. Following this period of stagnation, ADA broke out of the channel with a 72% surge.\n\nNow, ADA has undergone a 50% price correction, setting the stage for an impressive bull run ahead!\u201d\n\nLooking at the trader\u2019s chart, he seems to predict that Cardano will appreciate by roughly 2,080% from current levels.\n\nCardano is trading at $0.467 at time of writing.\n\nAs for Bitcoin (BTC), Martinez says that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator is flashing a bullish signal for the crypto king.\n\nTraders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles.\n\nSays Martinez,\n\n\u201cThe TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Bitcoin daily chart. It anticipates a one to four daily candlesticks rebound for BTC.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $62,750 at time of writing, up over 6% in the past day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum NFTs on Blast \u2013 Should ETH holders worry now? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Blast overtook Ethereum in terms of NFT volume\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price fell, network growth and velocity grew significantly on the charts\n\nEthereum [ETH] has largely been dominant in most sectors across the crypto-space. On a certain front, however, it would seem that the tides have shifted in favor of the Blast network.\n\nNFTs on full Blast\n\nRecent data suggests that over the last 24 hours, Blast NFT collections like PAC REKT, Blastopians, and Plutocrats have collectively generated more volume than the entire Ethereum NFT market across all exchanges.\n\nNow, even though Blast outperformed Ethereum in terms of NFT volume, a significant portion of this volume can be attributed to wash trading. For context, Wash trading in NFTs inflates trading volume by buying and selling between controlled wallets, creating fake popularity, and misleading investors. It undermines the NFT market by distorting prices and reducing real liquidity.\n\nEven though a large part of Blast\u2019s NFT volume can be due to wash trading, the declining interest in Ethereum NFTs does raise concerns about the state of the network. In fact, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the number of NFTs being traded has fallen significantly.\n\nTaking a deeper look\n\nNFT collections on other networks such as Bitcoin and Mythos managed to outperform Ethereum NFTs. According to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC and Crypto Punks were not able to get into the top 5 most sold NFTs over the last month. The number of Crypto Punk buyers fell by an alarming 20%, whereas the number of BAYC buyers fell by 2.78%.\n\nIf this trend continues, Ethereum may lose its top spot in the NFT sector soon.\n\nETH holders bleed\n\nAs far as ETH\u2019s price is concerned, at press time, it had climbed back above $3,000 on the back of Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. Additionally, the network growth for ETH continued to rise as well.\n\nRising network growth is a sign that new addresses have been showing interest in ETH. Velocity climbed too, implying a surge in transaction activity on the Ethereum network.\n\nRising interest from new addresses and growing velocity could help ETH see green and push the altcoin to the levels it was trading at prior to the latest market correction.\n\nHowever, the size of the addresses showing interest in ETH will also play a key role in Ethereum\u2019s future price movement.\n\nFor instance, addresses holding 100-10,000 ETH were declining at press time, according to Santiment\u2019s data. Substantial purchases made by large addresses can play a huge role in ETH\u2019s price trajectory in the future.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator"

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nIn the midst of recent turbulence in the crypto markets, characterized by a brief spell of uncertainty, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have emerged as beacons of resilience, surging to new heights. However, amidst this soaring trajectory, Furrever Token (FURR) has ignited a fresh wave of excitement by unveiling a lucrative opportunity for investors: the chance to pocket a substantial $10,000 reward. As BTC and ETH continue their upward ascent, the allure of FURR's enticing competition adds an extra layer of intrigue to the already exhilarating world of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Rockets Towards $62,000 Amidst Renewed Bullish Momentum\n\nAmidst a recent tumultuous period for the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) is staging an impressive rebound, surging by nearly 5% to reach around $61,857.26. This resurgence follows a sharp dip below $57,000, with BTC climbing 5.2% over the last 24 hours. Market analysts are closely eyeing the critical $62,000 level, identified as a key resistance point on BTC's daily chart. While some traders anticipate a bullish breakthrough, others caution against a strong rejection, emphasizing the significance of sustained volume and candlestick closure above this threshold.\n\nTechnical indicators and on-chain data suggest various levels of resistance and potential targets, with some analysts eyeing $82,000 as the initial objective. With signals of bullish momentum strengthening, Bitcoin's price action continues to draw attention, with a possible bull flag formation on the weekly chart signaling further upward potential towards all-time highs and beyond.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Regulatory Hurdles as SEC Decision Looms\n\nAmidst a backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $3,081.29, marking a 3.5% increase since yesterday. As the deadline for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approaches, industry experts express skepticism regarding approval. Analysts like Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor doubt the likelihood of approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs this May. Three prominent applicants, VanEck, Ark 21 Shares, and Hashdex Nasdaq, face hurdles as the SEC scrutinizes underlying securities issues, potentially leading to postponements rather than outright denials.\n\nConcerns are raised that Ethereum may be classified as a security by the SEC, a move that could impact not only Ethereum but also other major cryptocurrencies and ETF applicants. In contrast, Hong Kong's crypto market experiences significant growth, with nearly $300 million in weekly inflows following the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This divergence from the U.S. market, where spot Bitcoin ETFs face notable outflows, underscores the shifting dynamics of global crypto investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): A Whimsical Journey Through Presale Success and Cute Crypto Innovation\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is poised to captivate investors and accelerate through its remaining presale stages, leveraging a unique blend of charm and innovation. With a mission to infuse the crypto space with a delightful dose of cuteness, FURR transcends traditional use cases, offering users an irresistibly charming experience.\n\nIn a market dominated by serious blockchain projects, FURR stands out by fostering a warm and friendly community centered around the universal appeal of adorable cat imagery. The tokenomics of FURR are designed to incentivize participation, with 65% of tokens available during the presale, creating ample opportunities for early investors to secure their stake in this whimsical ecosystem. Moreover, the team's commitment to transparency and longevity is evident through the allocation of 10% of tokens, locked for a year, reassuring the community of their dedication.\n\nThe launch on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like PancakeSwap further enhances accessibility and liquidity, ensuring a seamless experience for investors. Held on the Gleam platform, the competition spans 7 days, offering participants the opportunity to accumulate points by completing various tasks. At the end of the frenzy, three lucky winners will each walk away with a share of the $10,000 prize pool in FURR tokens.
