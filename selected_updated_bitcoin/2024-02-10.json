        "content": "In a recent development, Ethereum [ETH] co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke\u2019s wallet has made a notable deposit of 4,300 ETH to a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe deposit made by Wilcke amounts to 22,000 ETH, valued at approximately $41.1 million at the time.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Rally: Experts Foresee ETH to $4,887 by 2024, $19,190 by 2030 - CoinGape",
        "content": "A recently published report by Finder conducted in January 2024 and shared with Coingape features the combined opinions of 40 crypto industry experts on the price projections for Ethereum (ETH) up to 2030. This survey, being a notable move to assess the growth potential of Ethereum, has delivered a common idea that there is a great future perspective of ETH among the participants.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Trajectory of Price Through 2030\n\nAs per the findings, the panelists expect a big rise in the market value of Ethereum and an average price of $4,887 by the end of 2024. This upward trend is expected to persist, with projections indicating a further growth to $7,492 by 2025 and an amazing jump to $19,190 by 2030.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese forecasts are all the more positive than the panel surveys in October 2023 and January 2023 and, in another way, highlight that the market and its performance are winning the confidence of market actors.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) has had a bullish rally in the last 24 hours with price bouncing between an intra-day low and high of $2,475 and $2,522. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,492, a 0.30% surge from the support level. During the rally, ETH market market capitalization surged to $299,492,362,705 while the 24-hour trading volume dipped by 36% to $8,169,785,827.\n\nExpert Ethereum Insights\n\nJonathan Hababou Solomon, co-founder and co-CEO of A.R.I.A., emphasized the significant milestone of Ethereum exceeding $2,470, indicative of a reversion to the bullish mode. Solomon and other experts, including Damian Chmiel of Finance Magnates, noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are strongly correlated. That suggests Ethereum may benefit from the same catalysts that have previously pushed Bitcoin up, such as ETF regimes and halving events.\n\nPedro Febrero, VP of Web3 at RealFevr, noted that Ethereum is in fact undervalued when compared to Bitcoin, considering its massive adoption and capabilities in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, etc. Nonetheless, experts\u2019 viewpoints on Ethereum\u2019s imminent future differed.\n\nWhilst some, including Josh Fraser of Origin Protocol, foresee an ETH peak price of $17,000 in 2024, influenced by such factors as possible ETFs and diminishing sell pressure, others, such as John Hawkins of the University of Canberra, take a more careful approach and predict a decline to $2,000.\n\nThe Consensus on Buying, Holding, or Selling ETH\n\nThe survey shows a strong preference for buying ETH, as 71% of the panelists recommend the acquisition at the current time. The expectation of Ethereum ETFs and the changing discourse around on-chain assets and decentralized applications gives credence to this view. Identically, a very small 3% of the shareholders believe that the best time to dispose of ETH is today because of the belief in the future development of Ethereum.\n\nDiversity of views is what one comes across in the discussion on the current valuation of Ethereum. Due to its impressive growth and potential as a global settlement layer, about half of the panelists think ETH is undervalued. On the other hand, however, a sizable 45% believe that Ethereum is fairly priced given the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential for a similar event happening for Ethereum. Though a small fraction of the market views ETH as overpriced, the persistent system flaws within the Ethereum network are pointed at.\n\nThe survey further looked at the competition between Ethereum and new blockchain platforms, such as Solana. The majority of analysts (66%) have predicted that crypto fans will rely on the usage of Ethereum and Solana, thus taking advantage of the different features each provides. This point of view leads to a diverse and multi-chain future of the blockchain industry where different platforms meet the needs and choices of different groups of users.\n\nRead Also: XRP Price Prediction As Renewed Recovery Hints 14% Surge, But There\u2019s A Catch\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.
