        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter a stunning climb last week, Solana (SOL) has cooled its rally and is now down over the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana, the seventh biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is down nearly 5% in the past day, trading hands for $55.39, CoinGecko data shows.\n\nLast week, the Ethereum-competitor had experienced a surge in price unlike any other coin or token over a month period. Its price notably soared past $50 for the first time since May 2022. The boom was likely down to a short squeeze caused by short sellers exiting their positions and renewed interest from institutions, experts said.\n\nBut despite the cool off today, Solana is up nearly 40% over the last seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is down 1% today Monday morning Eastern Time and is trading for $36,839. While the second-biggest digital asset Ethereum (ETH) is up nearly 2% and trading for $2,096.\n\nLast week Ethereum got a big boost past $2,000 for the first time in some months on the news that BlackRock had filed an application to list an iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of Solana's altcoin rivals are experiencing gains today.\n\nLeading the charge out of the major coins and tokens is decentralized storage provider Filecoin's native token FIL, which is up nearly 10% in 24 hours and priced in at $5.33, according to CoinGecko. Over the past seven days, it has shot up in value by 23%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProtocol Labs, the company behind Filecoin, is this week hosting a its LabWeek23 event in Istanbul, which might explain the sudden surge.\n\nOf other major players in the crypto market, Polygon (MATIC) is also up significantly today: the 13th biggest digital asset by market cap has surged more than 6% in the past day and is now trading for $0.88.\n\nAnd Cosmos (ATOM), a project which aims to create an \"Internet of Blockchains\" by improving interoperability, has also shot up by more than 9%; it's right now priced at $9.90.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

This move created further optimism that the crypto markets could see greater access, more significant institutional involvement, and liquidity.\n\nSo, as the price leading cryptocurrency\u2019s trade higher in part due to the potential of a regulated exchange-traded product tied to the spot price of Ethereum, it\u2019s worth looking closer at some individual stocks tied to digital currency and also noting where the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stands with regards to approving a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock takes steps toward launching Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock has officially confirmed its plans for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) through a filing with the SEC.

As of November 1, 2023, MicroStrategy possesses 158,400 bitcoins, acquired at an average purchase price of $29,609.65 per bitcoin, resulting in a total investment of $4.69 billion.\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)\n\nCoinbase Global is a major cryptocurrency exchange offering tools for trading over 200 cryptocurrencies. COIN shares have performed exceptionally on the year by any standard, up almost 163% and recently rallying double-digits off key support in the $70s.

The company offers cryptocurrency mining hardware, hosting services, and proprietary software. Shares of RIOT have impressed this year, to say the least, up 205%.
