        "title": "BlackRock debuts BUIDL, its first tokenized fund on Ethereum - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Coinbase has been chosen as a key infrastructure provider for the new fund.\n\nShare this article\n\nGlobal investment manager BlackRock announced on Wednesday the launch of its first tokenized fund powered by the Ethereum blockchain. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL, is designed to offer qualified investors a new way to earn US dollar yields through subscriptions via Securitize Markets, LLC.\n\nAccording to on-chain data , BUIDL was initially seeded with $100 million USDC after BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch it on March 15.\n\nCommenting on the launch, Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s Head of Digital Assets, said that it is a critical milestone in the company\u2019s digital assets strategy.\n\n\u201cThis is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy,\u201d Mitchnick stated. \u201cWe are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.\u201d\n\nThe tokenization of BUIDL allows for the issuance and trading of fund shares on the blockchain, offering benefits such as immediate settlement and enhanced liquidity, thus broadening the appeal to a more global investor base, as noted in the press release. BNY Mellon will facilitate the fund\u2019s interoperability between digital and traditional financial markets.\n\nCarlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, lauded the initiative. He said:\n\n\u201cTokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today\u2019s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.\u201d\n\nThe fund targets a stable token value of $1, distributing dividends as new tokens monthly. Its assets are entirely allocated to cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. will manage the fund, with BNY Mellon acting as custodian and administrator. Securitize will oversee tokenization and act as the transfer agent. The fund\u2019s initial minimum investment is set at $5 million, and it will issue shares under specific SEC rules.\n\nThe fund\u2019s ecosystem includes key players, including Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, alongside BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. as the investment manager, and Bank of New York Mellon as custodian and administrator. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been appointed as auditor.\n\nFurthermore, BlackRock\u2019s strategic investment in Securitize signifies a deep commitment to exploring digital asset solutions, with Joseph Chalom, BlackRock\u2019s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, joining Securitize\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nFor years, financial institutions have been exploring ways to harness blockchain technology to achieve tokenization of real-world assets. BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, is not part of those skeptical; he has repeatedly expressed his bullish outlook on the future of tokenization.\n\nIn a January interview with CNBC, Fink outlined a two-step vision for the future of financial markets. The first step, he said, has been realized with the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The second step, according to Fink, is \u201cthe token digitalization of the assets.\u201d He said that ETFs are key steps toward tokenization .\n\nBlackRock is currently pursuing regulatory approval for its spot Ethereum ETF filing, alongside other asset management giants like ARK Invest and VanEck. The SEC has a deadline of May 23 to make a decision on these applications."

        "title": "BlackRock to launch tokenized fund on Ethereum as battle for ETF intensifies - FXStreet",
        "content": "Investment giant BlackRock says it wants to bridge TradFi and the crypto market.\n\nEthereum is up 11% amid speculations of a real world assets bull run.\n\nETH is a commodity and not a security, says Coinbase's chief legal officer.\n\nEthereum (ETH) could be set for further growth after $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock announced on Tuesday it's launching a tokenized asset fund on the largest smart contracts blockchain. However, the Security and Exchange Commission's (SEC) battle to classify Ethereum as a security may spoil the fun.\n\nBUIDL to debut on Ethereum\n\nEthereum has been rising in the past 24 hours after BlackRock announced its decision to launch its first blockchain-based tokenized fund, BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), on the Layer One chain.\n\n\"BUIDL will offer investors important benefits by enabling the issuance and trading of ownership on blockchain,\" as stated on Business Wire. The announcement said this would \u201cexpand investors' on-chain offerings, provide instantaneous and transparent settlement, and allow for transfers across platforms.\u201d\n\nBUIDL aims to maintain a $1 peg per token as the fund would invest 100% of its underlying assets in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchasable agreements. Investors who subscribe to the fund will earn yields paid as new tokens to their wallets at the end of every month.\n\nBank of New York Mellon will serve as custodian and administrator for BUDL's underlying assets, while Securitize will serve as the tokenization platform and transfer agent. BlackRock's partnership with Securitize also includes an investment into the latter to solidify bonds. Other key infrastructure providers for the fund include Coinbase, Fireblocks, Anchorage Digital Bank NA, and BitGo.\n\nThis comes a few months after the SEC's Bitcoin spot ETF approval saw BlackRock debuting their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Additionally, BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, said in a recent interview, \"I believe the next step will be tokenization of financial assets...tokenization of securities.\"\n\nRead more: Ethereum faces steep correction as whales opt for profit-taking\n\nETH price growth faces fierce battle from the SEC\n\nAfter the announcement, some analysts in the crypto community speculated that this was a potential igniter to spark real-world assets (RWA) narrative growth. The real world assets category has recorded huge gains in the last 24 hours according to data from Coingecko.\n\nTop real world assets\n\nBut more importantly, Ethereum reaped gains of about 11% in the last 24 hours following BlackRock's update and currently trades at $3,566.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis follows the latest update on the spot ETH ETF, which saw the SEC issue subpoenas to three US companies dealing with ETH transactions, according to Fortune. Speculations are that the subpoenas are related to an investigation aimed at classifying Ethereum as a security. The investigation is said to be based on the 2022 timeline when Ethereum transitioned to proof of stake.\n\nThis would hurt any chances of the commission approving a spot Ether ETF, potentially causing a drop in Ethereum's price. Furthermore, the Ethereum Foundation acknowledged it has been receiving inquiries from \"state authority,\" which many believe to be the SEC.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Foundation subpoenae threatens ETH ETF approval odds\n\nHowever, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, has defended Ethereum in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), stating that \"ETH is a commodity, not a security,\" as confirmed by several federal courts and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He cited instances where senior SEC officials, including Gary Gensler, had said ETH isn't a security before he became SEC Chair.\n\n\"The SEC has no good reason to deny the ETH ETP applications. And we hope they won't try to invent one by questioning the long established regulatory status of ETH, which the SEC has repeatedly endorsed\", he further expressed."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFeeling bullish? Crypto traders today woke up and chose to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, with 90% of the top 100 coins by market capitalization jumping in price in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are up today by around 5% and 7%, respectively, and many other top altcoins are doing even better. It\u2019s all the more impressive when you consider it comes after a brief period of panic, during which Bitcoin experienced its worst day since November 9, 2022, falling 14.4% in 24 hours.\n\nLeading the charge among alts today is ONDO, the best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100, with a staggering 36.51% increase in the last 24 hours. ONDO is the governance token of the Ondo DAO, which currently focuses on boosting the Flux Finance ecosystem, a DeFi lending protocol that allows users to borrow against tokenized U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nOther coins that are doing well today include Conflux (CFX), the native token of the eponymous layer-1 blockchain that features a Tree-Graph consensus mechanism, combining proof and work and proof of stake (+27%); JasmyCoin (JASMY), the native token of the internet-of-things (IoT) provider Jasmy Corporation (+21.78%); and Kaspa (KAS), the native token of the Kaspa layer-1 blockchain that aims to be extremely efficient and fast via its GhostDAG protocol (16.32%).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut even the worst-performing token among the top 100, Render, was in the green most of the time today. However, a small intraday correction brought its price down by 3.5% in recent hours. Render is the token for a distributed GPU rendering network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNotably, all tokens in the green zone have experienced a price increase of more than 1% today.\n\nThis rebound comes after a short-lived panic episode that saw Bitcoin flash crash by 80% for a few minutes on BitMEX, leading to a massive sell-off. However, the leading cryptocurrency has since rebounded, increasing by more than 5.7% in the last 24 hours to its current price of $66,539.\n\nBTC-USD. 24 hour candlesticks. Image: Tradingview\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, has also experienced a significant surge, with a price increase of roughly 7% to its current price of just over $3,400.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMemecoins have also reacted positively to the overall rebound. Floki, the third best-performing token, has seen a growth of 26.92% to its current price of $0.000227. Bonk, while being the \"worst\" performer among the memecoins, still experienced a substantial 11.97% growth to its current price of $0.00002355.\n\nThe overall crypto market capitalization has grown from $2.36 trillion to $2.53 trillion in the last 24 days, with trading volume fluctuating above the $150 billion mark during most of the time, a high historical threshold that reflects how hot the crypto market is among traders right now.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a tool that measures investor sentiment and emotions, currently indicates a state of extreme greed among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This suggests a high level of optimism and risk-taking appetite in the market, which could be contributing to the current rally.\n\nThe positive trend extends beyond the cryptocurrency market, with the overall stock markets also showing signs of recovery. The Fear and Greed sentiment index indicates a state of extreme greed, a recovery from last week's \"greed\" status. Most of the largest global indices are in the green, with the exception of China and Brazil, which are slightly down.\n\nIn the U,S, the S&P 500 is up +0.6%, the Nasdaq spiked 0.78%, and the Russell 2000 is up +1.23%. In Europe, the STOXX 600 is up 0.9%, UK\u2019s FTSE100 is up +1.88%, France\u2019s CAC40 jumped 0.22% and Germany\u2019s DAX spiked 0.9%. Meanwhile, markets in Asia also saw a pretty good day with the Nikkei spiking over 2% in Japan, South Korea\u2019s Kospi growing over 2.4%, and the Taiwan stock market being up 2.10%.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."
