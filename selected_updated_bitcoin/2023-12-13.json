        "content": "An analysis of Ethereum\u2019s financial information has shown that an astronomical $2.5 billion worth of ETH has been burned since the Merge Event in September of 2022. Indeed, Ultrasound Money shows that the supply of Ethereum is at an 18-month low, currently standing at 309,663 ETH.\n\nThe development shows a clear contrast to the inflation that Ethereum had previously observed. Indeed, the asset has now shown a deflationary shift due to the 1,195,238 ETH that has been burned. Moreover, that permanent reduction in supply will have a long-term positive impact on the asset\u2019s value.\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAlso Read: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin in 2024? VanEck Weighs In\n\nEthereum Supply Drops by 1 Million ETH Since Merge\n\nThroughout the entire history of the digital asset sector, Bitcoin has reigned supreme. However, the rising prominence of Ethereum has caused it to be the only true competitor within the space. Moreover, the landmark merge event had been a massive moment in the increased prominence of the asset. Now, the fruits of that development are starting to take shape.\n\nSpecifically, recent observation has shown that Ethereum is $2.5 billion worth of ETH burned since that merge event in 2022. Altogether, the event has caused a net decrease in overall supply. That decrease has still been present despite the issuance of $1.86 billion worth of the digital asset.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Makes $78 Million Profit After Investing $11 Million\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s total supply is at its lowest point since that Merge event, with 120,211,380 ETH. Moreover, that supply equates to a market cap for the asset that is still north of $266 billion. Subsequently, it further reiterates the place Ethereum holds in the greater digital asset market.\n\nThe effects of that very Merge event are already being felt, but still have longstanding positives to be uncovered down the line. The decrease in supply will have a massive impact on the token\u2019s scarcity. Therefore, it will only grow in value overtime, and potentially ascend to previuoly unkown heights."

This spilled over to altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices showing strength alongside the king of cryptocurrency. It came after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes with Fed chair Jerome Powell hinting at more rate cuts than he did previously.

        "content": "Crypto firm Galaxy looks to collaborate with asset management firm DWS and trading specialist Flow Traders. Their goal is to introduce a stablecoin to accelerate the widespread adoption of on-chain assets.\n\nThe forward-looking plan seeks to capitalize on an evolving regulatory framework in Europe, but will ultimately hinge on various approvals.\n\nThe proposed stablecoin, named AllUnity, will be fully collateralized and denominated in euros, the company said Wednesday. The entity is planned to be incorporated in Frankfurt. Its next step involves applying for an E-money license from the German financial regulator BaFin. The company\u2019s aim is to launch the stablecoin within 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe stablecoin intends to launch on several public permissionless blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, a spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: SocGen\u2019s crypto unit debuts euro-pegged stablecoin\n\n\u201cDigital currencies are the natural evolution of the world\u2019s payment system, and Europe \u2014 a region at the forefront of the exploration of safe, secure digital money \u2014 is paving the way for this inevitable shift,\u201d Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said in a statement.\n\nThe firms expect to appoint Alexander H\u00f6ptner as AllUnity\u2019s CEO, according to the Wednesday news release. H\u00f6ptner has extensive experience as a chief executive, leading teams at 100x Group \u2014 the holding structure for crypto trading platform BitMEX \u2014 as well as stock exchange B\u00f6rse Stuttgart GmbH and financial services firm Euwax AG.\n\nThe plans come after passage of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in April. US lawmakers have lagged behind in making similar progress on such a framework.\n\nThe Europe regulation \u201cwe believe will contribute to growing the stablecoin market as it provides a robust regulatory framework that enhances investor protection and market integrity,\u201d H\u00f6ptner said in a statement.\n\nStablecoins \u2014 digital assets pegged to the value of another asset or fiat currency \u2014 have a combined market capitalization of roughly $130 billion, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nTether (USDT) is the dominant player in the segment with a market cap of about $90 million, USDC and DAI are a distant second and third with market caps of $24 billion and $5 billion, respectively.\n\nPayments giant PayPal debuted a dollar-backed stablecoin \u2014 issued on Ethereum by Paxos Trust Co. \u2014 in August.\n\nStablecoins enable peer-to-peer value transfers and protect against unstable currencies, as noted by Pantera Capital product manager Jeff Lewis in an October letter. They also enable users to conduct transactions without relying on the trustworthiness of service providers, but don\u2019t come without risks.\n\nRead more: Stablecoins set to succeed where BTC, ETH failed: Pantera\n\nGalaxy has crypto-focused asset management, global markets and digital infrastructure business units. The firm in September hired ex-Genesis sales head Leon Marshall as its CEO of Europe, noting the continent is critical to its growth strategy.\n\nGermany-based DWS \u2014 formerly a part of Deutsche Bank \u2014 had 860 billion euros (about $929 billion) in assets under management, as of Sept. 30.\n\nFlow Traders, headquartered in the Netherlands, offers liquidity across major exchanges and trading platforms via its trading hubs in Europe, the US and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nGalaxy and DWS have worked together before, expressing the intent earlier this year to roll out exchange-traded products in Europe. Galaxy, with partner Invesco, is among the fund issuers vying for a spot bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nIn a statement, DWS CEO Stefan Hoops highlighted that corporations with internet-of-things (IoT) businesses could use the proposed stablecoin to make fractional payments. He noted that these transactions could occur around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nHoops added: \u201cThrough the future creation of AllUnity, we will bridge the gap between the traditional and digital finance ecosystems to build a core infrastructure provider that facilitates secure on-chain settlement for institutional, corporate and private use.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.
