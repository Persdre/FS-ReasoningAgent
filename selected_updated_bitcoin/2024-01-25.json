        "content": "Quick Take\n\nTomorrow, Jan. 26, is the expiration of a staggering $5.82 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options, a potentially influential event for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets.\n\nThe options, divided into $3.75 billion for BTC and $2.08 billion for ETH, depict an interesting dynamic for both leading digital assets. For BTC, with a put/call ratio of 0.52 and a defined \u2018max pain point\u2019 at $41,000, there lies significant open interest of over $360 million at a strike price of $50,000.\n\nThe ETH options highlight a different scenario, evidenced by a lower put/call ratio of 0.31 and a \u2018max pain point of $2,300. There is also significant open interest of around $200 million at the price of $2400.\n\nSuch figures foretell potential fluctuation in the digital asset market following the options expiration at 8:00 AM UTC, Jan. 26."

        "content": "Ethereum price has dropped nearly 20% since the range high of $2,717 on January 12.\n\nETH downtrend could bottom out after a 5% extension to a buyer congestion level.\n\nThe bearish thesis will be invalidated if the PoS token breaks and closes above $2,388.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Spot Ether ETF application delay was deja vu as ETH holders remain hopeful like their BTC counterparts.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been rolling down a cliff since January 12 when news of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) redemptions broke. The slump has seen Ether fall out from below the confines of a bullish technical formation, but that could end soon as the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) theme gathers momentum.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Ethereum ETF: SEC delays BlackRock application; ETH price stays dormant\n\nSEC delays Grayscale spot ETH ETF application\n\nAfter Bitcoin, an ETH ETF is next on investors\u2019 radar, with Ark Invest COO Tom Staudt saying it will come \u201csoon\u201d. This is despite the delayed decision on Wednesday for BlackRock\u2019s spot ETH ETF application, which preceded another delay of Grayscale\u2019s ETH application, this time with an order to institute proceedings.\n\nBREAKING: SEC DELAYS GRAYSCALE SPOT ETHEREUM ETF (CONVERSION) pic.twitter.com/6WZ4HVsIQG \u2014 Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nDespite the delay, hope remains alive among ETH holders, crypto hobbyists and enthusiasts alike. This is because the spot BTC ETF investment product suffered a similar fate. As FXStreet reported, there were multiple delays for the eleven applicants and subsequent engagements between the filers and the financial regulator before the landmark approval on January 10.\n\nEthereum price eyes 5% swing south before possible bullish takeover as spot ETH ETF theme develops\n\nEthereum price is likely to extend the fall 5%, bringing total losses since the January 12 rejection to around 25%. If history is enough to go by, the $2,059 to $2,118 order block is likely to hold as support, providing ETH with an inflection point. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $2,088 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is southbound, suggesting falling momentum, whereas the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is in negative territory while stuck below its signal line (orange band). This accentuates the bearish thesis.\n\nFurthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator, which quantifies trend strength, is inching north, a sign that the predominant trend still abounds.\n\nIf the aforementioned order block fails to hold, Ethereum price could slip past it to tag confluence between the 200-day SMA and the horizontal line at $1,935, below which the big-picture bullish outlook would be invalidated.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the bulls enter the fray, Ethereum price could sidestep the anticipated 5% loss to push north and reclaim the support provided by the lower boundary of the channel. Increased buyer momentum above this level could see ETH shatter the 50-day SMA at $2,335, potentially extrapolating the gains above the $2,388 resistance, thereby invalidating the bearish thesis.\n\nAbove here, ETH could overcome the midline of the channel at $2,600 before Ethereum price clears the $2,717 resistance level as it reaches for the $3,000 psychological level, nearly 40% above current levels."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction For Jan 25: ETH Drop Below $2,100 Imminent Ahead of Major Rally? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: Ether recently achieved a notable milestone on January 12, reaching a peak of $2,715. This 80% surge was a response to the U.S. greenlighting spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the highest valuation for the year. Despite this, the weeks following have seen a downward trend in ETH\u2019s value, in line with broader market trends. Currently, Ethereum price hovers around $2,225, a marginal decline of 0.88%.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been fluctuating between $2,100 and $2,400 recently, indicating a tug-of-war between bullish and bearish forces. Over the last year, Ethereum has impressively climbed by 44%, showing remarkable resilience and sustaining bullish sentiment despite periodic setbacks. However, the past month has witnessed a slight downward trajectory, with a 2% decrease.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEther\u2019s trading price consistently fell below the $2,300 support mark in the past week, revealing a bearish pattern. This represents a 12% decrease over the week. Despite this dip, the current market outlook remains optimistic. ETH is the second most valuable cryptocurrency in market capitalization, now at $267 billion. This steadiness highlights Ethereum\u2019s significant and growing influence in the digital currency.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Critical Levels to Watch\n\nIn a recent tweet, MN Trading\u2019s CEO, Michael van de Poppe, provided valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s upcoming trajectory. He anticipates a surge in Ethereum\u2019s momentum in the coming weeks. This forecast is based on several key factors. Firstly, Bitcoin\u2019s recovery catalyzes a resurgence in alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe momentum towards $ETH is probably going to come in the next few weeks. Arguments:\n\n\u2013 #Bitcoin bottoming out is a trigger for altcoins to make a new run.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum Spot ETF hype.\n\n\u2013 Ethereum launching new upgrades to reduce 90% of the costs. pic.twitter.com/N8bDi52F8M \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 25, 2024\n\nAdditionally, there is growing excitement surrounding the potential introduction of an Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Fund. Furthermore, Ethereum is on the cusp of implementing significant upgrades. These enhancements are expected to reduce transaction costs by up to 90% dramatically. This trio of developments collectively signals a bullish future for Ethereum in the crypto market.\n\nIf Ethereum manages to break free from its current price bracket, the ensuing target might be the upper resistance line of the channel, estimated at around $2,300. With sustained bullish pressure, The coin could escalate to a high of $3,000 in the near term. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that a drop below the wedge\u2019s support level, especially at the $2,100 point, might initiate a downward trend toward the channel\u2019s lower support line near $2,000.\n\nThe technical indicators for ETH paint a mixed but cautiously optimistic picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently below the 50 mark, suggests a short-term bearish trend. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator tells a different story, displaying a positive trend. This is evidenced by the MACD line\u2019s upward cross over the signal line, hinting at a bullish outlook in the near future. Complementing this is an ascending histogram.\n\nThe 20 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) is on an upward trajectory, and notably, the 50-SMA has crossed above the 200-SMA, a classic bullish signal. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator, positioned at 0.03, also resides in the positive zone. This indicates that the market sentiment for Ethereum, at least in the near term, leans toward bullishness.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Ethereum price managed to hold the $2,200 support as the crypto market downturn intensified this week, on-chain signals highlight rising whale demand.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the crypto market suffered significant bearish headwinds as Bitcoin (BTC) prices wobbled below $40,000 for the first time in 50 days. At press time on Jan. 25, the global crypto market capitalization has shrunk 7%, with $108.5 billion in valuation wiped out within the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Crypto Market Cap Performance | Source: TradingView\n\nLosing 5% in Ethereum (ETH) price has maintained a relatively more resilient performance than the industry average between Jan. 22 and Jan. 24.\n\nEthereum whale activity remains high despite downtrend\n\nEthereum price has managed to keep losses below the 5% threshold this week, while Bitcoin and the global crypto market cap shrunk by up to 7%, respectively, before making a mild rebound. On-chain data trends suggest that the rising level of whale trading activity recorded on the Ethereum network this week has been pivotal to ETH\u2019s resilient price performance.\n\nSantiment\u2019s Whale transaction count metric tracks the daily number of transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency that exceeds $100,000.\n\nOn Jan. 23, the Ethereum Whale Transaction Count surged above 1,190. A closer look at the chart below shows this was the highest recorded since the ETH price raced to a 20-month peak of $2,690 on Jan. 11.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price vs. Whale Transaction Count | Source: Santiment\n\nCorporate entities accumulate ETH at significantly high volumes despite the broader market retreat. This could be attributed to investors and fund sponsors looking to acquire Ethereum ahead of a looming ETH spot ETF verdict.\n\nDuring market downtrends, an increase in whale transactions impacts the price of a crypto asset positively in two major ways. Firstly, it provides market liquidity, enabling bearish panic sellers to execute their trades at favorable prices. It also reinforces confidence among small-scale retail traders.\n\nThese factors have played a vital role as ETH battles to hold above the $2,200 support level amid market-wide sell-offs this week.\n\nEthereum investors opt for long-term storage\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum has also recorded a steady decline in exchange reserves this week, which could be linked to the rise in whale activity.\n\nCorporate entities and whales are known to be value investors who tend to hold for longer periods. Unsurprisingly, the rising volumes of whale transactions on the Ethereum network in recent months have coincided with a rapid decline in supply deposited on exchanges.\n\nAt the start of the week on Jan. 22, Ethereum supply on exchanges stood at 10.5 million ETH. But interestingly, that figure has dropped sharply to 10.4 ETH by Jan. 25.\n\nEffectively, this means that investors have shifted 150,000 ETH worth approximately $330 million from exchanges and trading platforms into long-term storage or staking contracts.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Supply on Exchanges vs. Price | Source: Santiment\n\nDespite bearish headwinds, Ethereum Supply on Exchanges dropped by 150,000 ETH in the last four days, signaling a dominant preference for long-term holding and passive income staking among current holders.\n\nNotably, Ethereum exchange supply has been in a downtrend since the Proof of Stake (PoS) transition in May 2023, a move that has coincided with an extended period of price uptrend.\n\nETH price prediction: Can Ethereum Price Stay Above $2,000?\n\nAs the downward trend in exchange supply persists, fewer ETH coins are readily available to be traded in spot markets. This appears to have decelerated the selling pressure on Ethereum this week relative to the broader altcoins market. Combined with the steady rise in whale transactions, Ethereum price is in a prime position to defend the $2,000 territory.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price data, which groups all existing ETH holders by their entry prices, also affirms this stance.\n\nIt shows that 8.3 million addresses, the largest cluster of ETH holders, had acquired 46.5 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,078. If Ethereum price slides toward $2,100, many of these holders could make frantic covering purchases to defend their positions to avoid slipping into net-loss positions. This could effectively trigger an instant Ethereum price rebound.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the upside, Ethereum bulls could overturn the bearish pressure if it reclaims the $2,500 territory. But this looks unlikely within the current market dynamics. As seen above, a significant cluster of 3.7 million addresses had acquired 7.1 million ETH at an average price of $2,400.\n\nIf they engage in mild profit-taking as prices hit their break-even point, Ethereum could slide into another correction phase."

        "title": "Four \u2018breakout\u2019 DeFi trends that will define crypto\u2019s coming bull market - DLNews",
        "content": "What you'll learn Novel DeFi like liquid restaking will draw more attention in 2024.\n\nLiquid restaking is already a $600 million market.\n\nYield chasing and airdrop farming will spur greater multi-chain engagement this year.\n\nDeFi was crypto\u2019s primary growth driver last year as it had twice as many users who completed over 100 transactions than any other crypto market sector.\n\nThis growth was fuelled by an increase in transaction activity on Ethereum layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism, and the return of Solana post-FTX collapse.\n\nThat trend is expected to continue this year amid a possible bull run with trading on decentralised exchanges and yield farming expected to be the most dominant on-chain activity in 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new on-chain crypto user report by blockchain data platform Flipside Crypto.\n\n\u201dSignificant regulatory, institutional, and financial announcements emerged every month,\u201d of 2023, the report said. \u201cThese developments set the stage for a breakout 2024.\u201d\n\nDriving that growth lately: EigenLayer, an Ethereum liquid restaking protocol.\n\nStaking in DeFi means to lock a token in a blockchain network or DeFi protocol, usually in exchange for yield.\n\nLocked tokens are typically unusable but some protocols like Lido offer liquid staking where a liquid staking token or LST is given in exchange for the locked crypto, as well as the opportunity to earn yield.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cNovel DeFi like EigenLayer will rise in prominence and adoption among web3 native audiences,\u201d Flipside said.\n\nLiquid staking has the advantage of giving users access to their locked coins in the form of the LSTs which they can deploy on other DeFi protocols to earn compounded gains.Flipside highlighted four other trends to watch:\n\nRestaking staked crypto\n\nLiquid restaking is an expansion of the DeFi liquid staking primitive. It allows users to restake their LSTs to earn more yield and another token called a liquid restaking token, or LRT.\n\nThere are even protocols like Pendle that will accept an already yield-bearing LRT deposit from a user and provide them with another yield-bearing token, taking the compounded yield potential further.\n\nFlipside\u2019s prediction of a liquid restaking boom this coming year may already be showing signs of becoming a possibility. The new DeFi sector is already a $600 million market \u2014 a market growth driven not only by the compounded yield frenzy but also the possibility of airdrops.\n\nNovel DeFi niches like liquid restaking come with the expectation of airdrops for early participants. Such expectations have been boosted by majors like EigenLayer offering a points system for depositors as points have become a bellwether for possible airdrops.\n\nDespite its growth potential, Flipside does not envisage a bubble emerging because of liquid staking this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a ways away from the 2021 frenzy, where anyone could simply fork a project and slap on 10,000% APY inflation tokens to attract users,\u201d Flipside data scientist Carlos Mercado told DL News.\n\nInstead, Mercado identified the lack of client diversity among Ethereum stakers and validators as a possible cause for concern. More than 80% of Ethereum validators run Geth, an execution client responsible for processing transactions and deploying smart contracts.\n\nThis dependence on Geth makes it a supermajority client in Ethereum and any problems with Geth could cause system-wide failures in Ethereum.\n\nGiven the possible scale of the problem, Mercado said he expects stakeholders to diversify to other clients.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that these staking methods compete directly with other on-chain opportunities, so there\u2019s natural pushback against it becoming \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2014 as the yields fall with more participants,\u201d Mercado said.\n\nMulti-chain engagement\n\nFlipside\u2019s report only covers eight blockchains \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, Solana, Avalanche \u2014 all but Bitcoin and Solana are EVM networks.\n\nEVM networks run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and use the same smart contract logic for their applications. This compatibility also makes for easier liquidity migration via protocols called bridges that allow users to send crypto across different blockchains.\n\nLast year, however, only a small percentage of users interacted with at least two EVM chains. But Flipside expects a change this year with greater multi-chain engagement among DeFi users, especially those looking to capitalise on yield and airdrop opportunities across different blockchains.\n\nGreater multi-chain engagement will mean flexible liquidity migration and an uptick in the volume of crypto flowing across bridges. Bridge protocols have historically been targets for hackers leading to some of crypto\u2019s biggest thefts including the $125 million that disappeared from cross-chain bridge Multichain last year.\n\nMercado noted that bridge security is a big deal while adding that market participants are gravitating towards more secure solutions for cross-chain crypto transactions.\n\n\u201cThe lock and mint mechanism prevalent throughout 2021-2022, which left a honeypot of tokens that hackers eyed, has faced significant competition from order book or routing bridges that are more efficient in volume transferred per value locked, and canonical bridges like USDC\u2019s Cross Chain Transfer Protocol,\u201d Mercado said.\n\nCompeting layer 2 blockchains\n\nThree of the blockchains covered in the Flipside report \u2014 Arbitrum Optimism, and Base \u2014 are Ethereum layer 2. These are networks created to scale Ethereum by processing transactions away from the mainnet but still rely on Ethereum\u2019s security for finality.\n\nPolygon is also an Ethereum scaling blockchain but is technically not a layer 2, but rather, a side-chain.\n\nEthereum layer 2s have experienced a Cambrian explosion in the past 18 months, bloating the EVM blockchain market. With limited investor liquidity, the report predicts greater competition among incumbents especially in lowering transaction costs and offering a smoother user experience.\n\nEthereum, itself stands to gain from the rivalry among its layer 2 networks as increased network activity means more money for validators.\n\nThis struggle for market share dominance among Ethereum layer 2 networks may also affect the value of their respective native tokens, the report said.\n\nBooming infrastructure and chain specialisation\n\nApart from Ethereum layer 2 networks, crypto\u2019s overall infrastructure stack expanded last year and Flipside is predicting an even greater boom in 2024.\n\nThe report pointed to significant gains in the likes of zero-knowledge technology and data availability solutions like Celestia as reasons for such expectation.\n\nNewer entrants like scaling blockchain Monad and Berachain are also expected to contribute to this growth, the report said.\n\nUltimately, the report expects that developers will optimise for their respective technological strengths leading to specialised blockchains rather than the general-purpose blockchain networks currently available.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.
