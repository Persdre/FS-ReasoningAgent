        "content": "Advertisement\n\nGrayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has seen its discount narrow significantly, dropping to 16%. This marks a substantial change from its nearly 30% discount a month ago and close to 60% earlier this year.\n\nNate Geraci, an industry analyst, suggests that this trend could be interpreted as a gauge of market expectations regarding the approval of a spot ether ETF.\n\nCurrently, ETHE stands at an impressive $6 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nGrayscale's new conversion effort\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Grayscale, the leading crypto asset manager, has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its ETHE into a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETHE, launched in early 2019, has become the foremost Ether investment vehicle globally, accounting for 2.5% of the chief altcoin's total circulating supply.\n\nThis followed Grayscale's recent legal victory against the formidable regulator. A federal appeals court has ruled in their favor regarding their Bitcoin trust's ETF conversion application, thus adding momentum to their Ethereum efforts.\n\nConverting the trust into a spot ETF would be a significant development for the company and the crypto market. ETFs are well-known and widely used investment vehicles that are familiar to both retail and institutional investors. This familiarity could attract a broader investor base to Ether. This would enhance liquidity and potentially stabilize the market. Additionally, ETFs generally offer lower fees and greater transparency compared to trusts, making them more appealing to cost-conscious investors.\n\nBlackRock's Ethereum ETF plan\n\nIn parallel, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has revealed its intention to bet big on Ethereum. Recently, the financial titan registered the iShares Ethereum Trust and partnered with Nasdaq, intending to list and trade shares of this trust.\n\nFollowing this announcement, Ethereum's price experienced a surge, reaching a high of nearly $2,150.\n\nBlackRock is also attempting to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. Analysts believe that the SEC is very likely to greenlight such a product in the near future.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has notably shifted from skepticism to becoming a vocal crypto proponent."

        "content": "Happy Friday. The week is ending on a high note for Ethereum, which is back in the news after financial giant BlackRock filed to launch an ETF backed by Ether, the blockchain\u2019s native currency. This led the price to jump 10%, back over the $2,000 mark, for the first time in months as investors bet that BlackRock\u2019s entry will attract billions of dollars in new capital.\n\nThis development brings renewed attention to the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, which has largely been overshadowed by Bitcoin and even Solana during the long-awaited rally of the last two months. But while Ethereum boosters are rightfully enjoying the price surge, the return of the spotlight has also raised some familiar concerns.\n\nThese include griping about Ethereum\u2019s transactions costs, known as gas fees, which have soared along with the burst of activity on the blockchain that has come with more trading. For long-time crypto watchers, this will bring back unpleasant memories of 2017 and 2021 when hype over Ethereum\u2019s smart contract promise led to a surge in price\u2014followed by the blockchain slowing to a crawl, which in turn forced those who wanted to transact to pay outrageous fees.\n\nEthereum\u2019s momentous shift last year to a proof-of-stake system was supposed to alleviate the price and congestion issues, along with so-called layer-2 solutions\u2014sub-layers on the network that process transactions in batches and then record them on the main blockchain.\n\nThe trouble is that while the layer-2 systems do indeed lower costs dramatically, they add complexity and make the Ethereum user experience\u2014already an ordeal for those who aren\u2019t crypto diehards\u2014even more of a headache. They are also less secure. This has led some to gripe that Ethereum should have devoted its energy to making its main network cheaper and efficient rather than outsourcing the task to other projects.\n\nFinally, the switch to proof of stake has also raised concerns over centralization as a relatively small amount of validators are now responsible for maintaining the network\u2014a fact that Bitcoin purists, never gracious at the best of times, have lampooned mercilessly as part of the crypto world\u2019s eternal infighting.\n\nNone of this means that Ethereum is facing major trouble\u2014the network is the leading smart contract for a reason, with by far the most users and a robust and dedicated developer community. But as a new crypto bull market emerges, it will be harder for the platform to blame familiar headaches on growing pains. Ethereum is now almost a decade old, and the time has come for it to show it can deliver on its enormous potential.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nChainlink's LINK token is up 175% since January as the oracle provider has branched out from pure crypto pricing to tie-ups with the TradFi sector.

        "content": "SOL more than doubled in the last month. But here\u2019s why Ethereum NFTs continue to outperform Solana NFTs by a mile.\n\nSolana is ripping. Not only has general crypto market sentiment turned more positive, which has boosted assets beyond just bitcoin, but Solana also just completed another one of its attention-grabbing conferences, Breakpoint. That\u2019s all led to SOL more than doubling in the past month.\n\nDespite developer interest in Solana, the jump in its token price, and the fact that the speedy chain is known for NFT activity, as of yet, the leading blockchain for NFTs remains Ethereum.\n\nRead more: NFT Trading Activity on Ethereum Surges, Reaching a Six-Month High\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, in the past 30 days, Ethereum led the NFT market in sales volume with $245 million in sales. Ethereum\u2019s activity underscores its dominance, with a vast number of transactions totaling 745,175 and engaging 70,423 buyers.\n\nComparatively, Solana, which stands fourth in the ranking, reported $30.1 million in sales, just 12% of Ethereum\u2019s volume, even after considering the fact that SOL has outperformed ETH by 127% in the last 30 days.\n\nWith Solana struggling to grab market share in the NFT ecosystem, Hildebert Mouiliere, aka Hildobby, a data scientist at VC firm Dragonfly, told Unchained that \u201ca lot of things that appear on [Solana] are just copying what happened on Ethereum, which isn\u2019t very innovative.\u201d\n\nSolana is also battling the fact that Ethereum\u2019s longer history makes it a hub for many types of activity beyond just NFTs. \u201cI think Ethereum has become a center of liquidity for a lot of things,\u201d said gmoney, NFT collector and founder of 9dcc. \u201cAnd not just NFTs, but also certain tranches of DeFi and what have you. And so I think that\u2019s going to be hard to displace even though there are narratives that build up around other chains.\u201d\n\nHowever, Solana could still become a contender if it builds on the particular advantages of its technology over Ethereum. \u201cI hope that we see in the future some teams actually using what this tech can do to leverage what is lower fees and higher frequency transaction,\u201d said Hildobby.\n\nRead more: Anatoly Yakovenko on Solana\u2019s Astounding Recovery and Its Future Plans\n\nOver a year has passed since marketplaces like Magic Eden sparked a seismic shift in the NFT industry by making creator royalties optional\u2014a move that continues to influence market dynamics.\n\nHildobby noted the complex nature of enforcing such payments and suggested that creators may need to consider additional incentives to encourage voluntary compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to enforce those things,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for where the market could go, Hildobby said he\u2019s looking to the rise of NFT derivatives and lending platforms, which could diversify NFTs as financial instruments. \u201cThe vast majority of volume now is around lending, which allows for those high prices to now land at a much discounted rate,\u201d Hildobby explained, emphasizing the potential for these platforms to broaden market participation.\n\nLearn more: What Are NFT dApps?\n\nGmoney also thinks future innovation in NFTs will come in their financialization and bringing real world assets on chain. As an example, he said, \u201cthe sneaker resell market is huge,\u201d noting that with NFTs, \u201cyou can give them access to credit that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Once that is a proven application, he said that could show the potential for NFTs to unlock value in other collectors\u2019 items such as watches and handbags. \u201cTo me, one of the most interesting things is obviously, definitely the real world asset side of things, because I just think that you need to see the melding of those two worlds at some point, and I think that starts to happen over the next three to five years.\u201d"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThis week, half-giddy, half-cautious optimism spread across crypto circles as Bitcoin surged past $37,000 for the first time in 18 months on excitement regarding the approval a spot Bitcoin ETF, and Ethereum pumped past $2,100 on similar news of a pending ETH ETF application from BlackRock.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly an emergent hope within crypto that the bottom\u2014finally\u2014is in. But to those who protest that it could never be a true bull market without obscenely expensive, seemingly pointless JPEGs trading hands: there\u2019s now reason to rejoice on that front as well.\n\nOn Friday, two separate on-chain images of illustrated rocks\u2014one hosted on Ethereum as an NFT, the other inscribed on Bitcoin as an Ordinal\u2014sold for six-figure respective sums on secondary markets.\n\nAn NFT from the EtherRocks collection, EtherRock #95, traded hands this morning for 100 ETH, or just over $209,000. Just hours prior, an Ordinal from the visually identical Bitcoin Rock collection sold for 2.99 BTC, worth just over $111,000 at writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe JPEGs do not come with any affiliated memberships or perks, or anything that doesn\u2019t meet the eye. They are, quite simply, lightly illustrated images of nearly indistinguishable gray boulders that don\u2019t even feature backgrounds.\n\nBitcoin Rock #75 has sold for 3btc on the secondary market. Congratulations to @Scobra9000 on the sale. A warm welcome to @GrantWSchneider, already a legendary collector in the ordinals community, who has now taken it to the highest level. pic.twitter.com/wkqkk8Kbn9 \u2014 BITCOIN ROCKS \u25c9 (@ordrocks) November 10, 2023\n\nDumb as rocks?\n\nEtherRocks first launched in 2017 to little fanfare. Only during the height of the NFT bull run, in late 2021, did the 100-piece collection catch fire\u2014largely as a means to poke fun at the absurdity of value and the crypto market. Individual EtherRocks regularly sold at the time for hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece; one sold for the equivalent of $1.3 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMonetary value of art is all an illusion,\u201d an EtherRocks buyer wrote at the time. \u201cThe pet rocks present the perfect shock value, it\u2019s so stupid that it\u2019s perfect. Fate loves irony.\u201d\n\nIn January, an apparently unaffiliated Ordinals user inscribed a set of 100 images almost identical to the EtherRocks onto small denominations of Bitcoin, creating a new collection: Bitcoin Rocks. While that Ordinals collection has not enjoyed the same success as its Ethereum predecessor, it has generated five-figure secondary market sales in recent months.\n\nIn the context of recent market trends, though, Friday\u2019s sales appear to be hitting differently. Numerous Twitter users saw the news as a harbinger of the return of the type of obscenity, absurdity, and flagrant financial foolishness that defined the previous crypto bull run.\n\nLol that scam again.\n\nWe're so back \u2014 Dr.M\u20b3ryJ\u26a1I buy Shitcoins,I hold \u20bfitcoin \u2764\u20b3d\u20b3\u1d3a\u1da0\u1d40\ud80c\udebd (@mary_el83) November 10, 2023\n\nMembers of the crypto community appear divided about whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.\n\nThis space never fails to amaze me \u2014 sugarspicysauce (@sugarspicysauce) November 10, 2023\n\nBut despite the return of bull market antics, crypto activity is nowhere close to the levels enjoyed when EtherRocks were last ascendent. Though Bitcoin Ordinals trading did indeed hit a six-month high earlier this week, and NFT trading volume posted its best numbers since August, those numbers still pale in comparison to the type of volume witnessed during the 2021/2022 NFT bull run.\n\nLast week\u2019s apparently encouraging NFT figures, for example, marked a 93% decrease in trading volume from the market\u2019s peak in April 2022. But these pricey digital rock purchases point to at least a desire for the same kind of frothy, frenzied excitement that defined that earlier era.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s latest surge to over $2,098 signals a bullish market trend. What\u2019s driving the price, and how far will ETH go?\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, experienced a noteworthy surge on Nov. 9, reaching its 52-week high of $2,137.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum is well above the $2000 mark, trading at approximately $2,098, marking a nearly 10% increase within a 24-hour period\u200b\u200b.\n\nOverall, since the beginning of the year, Ethereum has seen an impressive uptick, increasing by more than 75% year to date (YTD)\u200b\u200b. However, despite these gains, Ethereum is still considerably below its all-time high of $4,891 in November 2021\u200b\u200b.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper into Ethereum\u2019s recent price action, explore the underlying factors driving this surge, and provide insights into where Ethereum could be headed in the coming days.\n\nWhy the ETH price is up\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price can be attributed to a combination of factors. One of the significant triggers for Ethereum\u2019s price increase on Nov. 9 was BlackRock\u2018s registration of an iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware.\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING: The iShares Ethereum Trust has just been registered in Delaware.\n\n\n\nBlackRock did the same thing before filing for a $BTC spot ETF. $ETH spot ETF incoming?\n\n\n\nh/t: @SummersThings pic.twitter.com/e4kxAZrcOG \u2014 Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) November 9, 2023\n\nIndustry observers believe that Blackrock is preparing to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) following the potential approval of its spot Bitcoin ETF proposal.\n\nYou might also like: Understanding Bitcoin\u2019s recent market dynamics and price predictions\n\nBlackrock applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, 2023, and is now awaiting a verdict from the SEC.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts have indicated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might soon decide on the approval of 12 Bitcoin ETFs filed by major Wall Street firms, which has contributed to the bullish sentiment in the crypto market\u200b\u200b.\n\nNew Research note from me today.

In September 2023, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain volume was around 1.5 billion, which has increased to 2.62 billion as of Nov. 10.\n\nETH on chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial as it indicates the level of activity and usage of the Ethereum network. A higher on-chain volume often suggests increased adoption and utilization of the network for transactions.\n\nGenerally, a higher on-chain volume can signify heightened investor and user interest in Ethereum, which can positively influence its price. As more transactions occur, it implies a robust demand for ETH, potentially leading to a rise in its value.\n\nETH deposited to the Beacon Chain\n\nThis refers to the amount of ETH staked in the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain and the number of validators participating in the network. The staked ETH in the Beacon Chain increased from 786,000 in August 2023 to 885,000 as of Nov. 10.\n\nDeposited ETH on the Beacon Chain | Source: The Block\n\nDepositing ETH into the Beacon Chain for staking is vital for the security and operation of the Ethereum 2.0 network. More staked ETH and validators mean a more secure and decentralized network.\n\nAn increase in staked ETH and validators can boost confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term stability and demonstrate a commitment from stakeholders to the network\u2019s success, which can be a bullish signal for investors.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price prediction\n\nWhile exploring Ethereum price predictions, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties in such forecasts. These predictions are speculative and subject to market volatility.\n\nAn ETH price prediction for Nov. 25 projects a value of $2,199.93, showing a 5.17% increase. For December 2024, the ETH prediction is around $3,555.88.\n\nAn ambitious ETH price analysis suggests Ethereum might reach $4,487.64 in 2023 and potentially $6,809.84 by 2025.\n\nRemember, cryptocurrency investments are risky, and market predictions can be inaccurate. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider seeking professional financial advice. Stay informed and cautious, especially in the volatile crypto market."
