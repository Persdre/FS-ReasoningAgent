        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum network, made some interesting comments during a recent interview. One of them was his revelation of the worst thing that usually happens on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Worst Thing That Happens On Ethereum\n\nVitalik mentioned that the worst thing that happens on Ethereum is when people lose money. It is, however, worth mentioning that this particular comment came in relation to his earlier remarks about the impact that wars and dictators have on human lives. This was meant to be light-hearted in comparison to the \u201cheavy things\u201d he had just spoken about.\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik is of the opinion that crypto has a major role to play in any bid to curb the excesses of those in power. He said that crypto can \u201ccounter-pressure\u201d the powers of these governments and large corporations.\n\nCrypto is already doing this, as he highlighted how people have more control over their finances and the government cannot easily grab their money up to fund wars. He also alluded to ZK (Zero Knowledge) technology and how people can prove things about themselves without such information being maliciously used by the government.\n\nThese statements made by Vitalik once again emphasize the essence of cryptocurrencies and their role in creating a decentralized economy. As people continue to lose faith in the traditional financial system, crypto has provided a haven for those looking to have more control of their finances.\n\nETH price falls below $2,400 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nDigital Democracy On ETH\n\nVitalik also touched on Ethereum and the need to make certain protocol upgrades. He specifically noted how some of these upgrades are economic. For those, Vitalik believes there is a need for the Ethereum community to be more involved to avoid a similar system, which crypto aims to eliminate.\n\nTo achieve this, the Ethereum co-founder proposed innovating a better kind of democracy tool where members could use ZK votes to make their voices heard. At the same time, there will also be a need to develop tools that can weed out those who aren\u2019t actually part of the community, he said. That way, core ETH developers can actually implement upgrades that reflect the wishes of everyone in the community.\n\nVitalik also sounded optimistic about the future of Ethereum. He stated that the network has improved greatly and achieved \u201camazing success\u201d in terms of scaling and improving UX, security, and privacy. These, in his opinion, were some of Ethereum\u2019s biggest problems in the last 10 years.\n\nRegarding scaling, the ETH co-founder says the \u201cbiggest thing\u201d that happened in 2023 was the fact that Rollups became more secure. These layer-2 networks could help Ethereum potentially scale to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nFeatured image from Coingape, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency markets started the new year of 2024 on the front foot as Bitcoin climbed above the $45,000 mark. The price rise pulled other leading altcoins into the green as Ethereum touched $2,400. The positive rise was also reflected in the memecoin segment as Shiba Inu deleted a zero and hit $0.00001080 on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency market momentum for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu remains positive with investors\u2019 enthusiasm on a high for 2024.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Can SHIB Reach $0.01 in 2024?\n\nA handful of analysts have provided bold price predictions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu in 2024. In this article, we will highlight how high BTC, ETH, and SHIB cryptocurrencies can rise this year in 2024, according to analysts.\n\n3 Boldest Price Predictions For 2024: Bitcoin, Ethereum, & Shiba Inu\n\n1. Bitcoin (BTC) 2024 Price Prediction\n\nSource: Pintrest\n\nInvestors are hopeful that the SEC will approve the much-awaited Bitcoin ETF before Q2 of 2024. The move will allow a flood of investments into the cryptocurrency markets, especially Bitcoin. The prices of BTC are expected to soar after the BTC ETF approval, which will eventually make other cryptocurrencies hit new highs. CoinShares has provided a bold prediction claiming that Bitcoin\u2019s price could climb above the $80,000 mark this year in 2024.\n\n\u201cEstimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000,\u201d said James Butterfill, CoinShares Head of Research to CNBC.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Shibarium To Start Burning SHIB Tokens From January 2024\n\n2. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nSource: CNN\n\nA leading price prediction analyst boldly claims that Ethereum could \u201ceasily\u201d hit $10,000 this year in 2024. According to the prediction, ETH could reach a deflationary stage making the cryptocurrency begin surging in price. The development might make Ethereum sustainably scale up in the charts and add new investments along the way. The combination of fresh funds and its deflationary status might make Ethereum reach $10,000, claims the prediction.\n\nAlso Read: 5 U.S. Sectors To Be Affected If BRICS Ditches the Dollar For Trade\n\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nSource: Watcher Guru\n\nA handful of predictions boldly claim that Shiba Inu could delete most of its zeroes and reach the $0.01 mark. These predictions are not new in 2024 but have been repeating on a loop since 2020. There\u2019s nothing to be taken at face value as SHIB has a long way to reach the $0.01 mark as its circulating supply stands at 549 trillion tokens. There is no guarantee that Shiba Inu will skyrocket in price in 2024.\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and can swing both ways delivering losses to investors. There is no guarantee that BTC could reach $80,000 ETH $10,000, and SHIB to $0.01. It is advised to do thorough research before taking an entry position into the cryptocurrency markets at the moment."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Poised for 2-3x Gains As Per These On-Chain Indicators - CoinGape",
        "content": "As the bitcoin (BTC) price jumped 7% shooting past $45,000 in the wake of Bitcoin ETF approval, altcoins too joined the party. The Ethereum (ETH) price is up once again by 2% in the last 24 hours, moving closer to $2,400.\n\nOn-chain indicators for Ethereum continue to show strength, suggesting a much larger rally ahead from here onwards. Predictions are already strong that the ETH price can rally all the way to $10,000 by this year\u2019s end.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) On-Chain Indicators\n\nIn a recent market analysis, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez expressed a bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH). Martinez highlighted a promising path ahead for Ethereum, emphasizing the absence of significant supply barriers, which could pave the way for potential gains to $2,700 or beyond.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis pointed out a robust demand wall at $2,000, indicating substantial support that may act as a cushion in the event of corrections. The positive forecast aligns with the current market dynamics, reflecting optimism regarding Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory in the near term.\n\nIn insights shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands indicate pivotal price targets for the cryptocurrency. Martinez pointed out that, according to the data, the next significant price targets for Ethereum ($ETH) are identified at $3,830 and $5,100. This analysis provides valuable guidance for investors and market participants, shedding light on potential future price movements in the Ethereum market.\n\nETH Exchange Supply Falling Sharply\n\nAnother positive indicator for Ethereum is the sharp drop in the exchange supply. Data from Santiment reveals that the supply of ETH tokens on exchanges has reached an unprecedented all-time low since the inception of Ether.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges represents only 8.04% of the total ETH supply. This marks the lowest level recorded since the cryptocurrency\u2019s genesis. The on-exchange supply of an altcoin like ETH often plays a crucial role in influencing its market price. A decrease in the supply is generally perceived as a bullish indicator, suggesting a potential reduction in selling pressure on ETH.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared a roadmap that seeks to improve the efficiency of the PoS system.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Solana NFT Sales Skyrocket, Topping Ethereum in Monthly Volume for First Time - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana\u2019s surging fortunes of late have produced a surprising result in the NFT market: monthly sales volume of NFTs on the network beat that of NFTs on Ethereum in December 2023, for the first time ever.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform CryptoSlam, Solana NFT sales tallied about $366.5 million worth in December compared to $353.2 million on Ethereum. CryptoSlam\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d sales figures exclude suspicious trades marked as \u201cwash trading,\u201d with about $381 million worth of Ethereum sales excluded and just $10.1 million worth of Solana sales pulled out.\n\nSolana\u2019s total of $366.5 million in trades nearly matched the network\u2019s all-time high, according to CryptoSlam, which was about $373.5 million worth in October 2021 as the space was just heating up. We\u2019ve seen daily Solana NFT sales volume pop above Ethereum at times, but never in terms of a full month\u2019s worth of trades.\n\nSolana saw about double the amount of unique buyers and sellers in December too, and far more total NFT transactions. CryptoSlam reports about 218,000 sellers and 279,000 buyers on Solana across nearly 6.6 million NFT transactions. Compare that to about 114,000 sellers and over 143,000 buyers on Ethereum, across 698,000 transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT sales volume in December was pretty much flat compared to November\u2019s total of almost $350 million worth, while Solana saw a surge from about $83 million worth then.\n\nOf course, Solana has seen its price rise dramatically of late. SOL is up over 71% in the past month, and has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. Ethereum, by contrast, is up 9% in the last 30 days and about 44% since three months ago.\n\nSolana\u2019s price jump may be part of the reason why the value of its NFT sales spiked in December, but it doesn\u2019t account for the roughly tripled number of unique traders and sixfold increase on monthly NFT transactions. Also, the average NFT sale on Solana actually fell from about $74 in November to under $56 in December.\n\nThe surge in users and transactions may be due to broader momentum around Solana and hype around particular projects tied to potential access to airdrops and other perks. Tensorians, for example, the NFT project tied to leading Solana marketplace Tensor, saw $28 million worth of trades in December, while Mad Lads generated $24.5 million in trades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, the top Ethereum NFT project in December was the Bored Ape Yacht Club with $19.5 million worth of NFT trades, with Pudgy Penguins following behind with about $18.3 million worth of trades.\n\nAt a glance, CryptoSlam\u2019s data suggests that Bitcoin Ordinals trades\u2014that is, the protocol that enables NFT-like media to be put on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014generated more trading volume than Ethereum and Solana combined in December, with $881.2 million worth across over 493,000 transactions.\n\nHowever, CryptoSlam tracks Bitcoin Ordinals differently than it does NFTs on other networks. The data includes trading of BRC-20 tokens, which are minted via the Ordinals protocol but function like fungible, interchangeable tokens on other chains. CryptoSlam does not track the trading of Ethereum ERC-20 tokens or Solana SPL tokens, which are effectively similar to BRC-20 tokens.\n\nUncategorized Ordinals\u2014that is, various media assets that aren\u2019t part of a defined project\u2014made up about $88.5 million worth of trades in December, with the top individual Ordinals project being Bitcoin Frogs at $27.7 million.\n\nThe next-highest ranking individual Ordinals project that isn\u2019t a BRC-20 token? Bitcoin Punks, a CryptoPunks knockoff, with less than $3.3 million worth of trades in December. Fungible token trades make up an enormous portion of Ordinals trading tracked on the platform, making it difficult to take the Bitcoin figures at face value."

        "title": "A comprehensive outlook on altcoin predictions for 2024: trends and insights - crypto.news",
        "content": "Unpacking altcoin predictions for 2024, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s advancements, Solana\u2019s market position, and the trajectories of promising altcoins.\n\nAs 2023 has come to a close, let\u2019s delve into the altcoins forecast and find out what might be next for these digital currencies.\n\nThroughout 2023, a few top altcoins stood out due to their impressive performance and notable advancements.\n\nInjective Protocol (INJ) leads the pack, showcasing a growth of over 3000% over the past year. This surge can be attributed to several factors, including its mainnet upgrade, which introduced new features like message signing, advanced balance indexing, and upgraded WASM smart contracts.\n\nFollowing closely is Immutable (IMX), which experienced over 490% surge. Immutable stood out for its approach to decentralized trading, aiming to offer a fully decentralized and trustless on-chain order book-based DEX development infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, THORchain (RUNE), another rising altcoin, saw its value increase over 340% last year despite difficult market conditions, reflecting the growing ecosystem of the Cosmos-based blockchain protocols.\n\nWhile the past performance of best-performing altcoins like INJ and IMX offers insights, the focus shifts to what the future holds, especially for the most promising altcoins for 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper and uncover the potential trends that could shape the altcoin price prediction in the upcoming year.\n\nEthereum L2s could gain the momentum\n\nIn 2024, the altcoin market, especially Ethereum (ETH) and its layer 2 (L2s) networks, is brimming with potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade, EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), could significantly reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability. This is crucial for L2 chains like Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP).\n\nVanEck predicts that this upgrade could usher in a more efficient altcoin market. Particularly, it\u2019s anticipated that within a year, Ethereum\u2019s L2 networks will consolidate to 2-3 dominant players. These platforms could be major contributors to the altcoin forecast for 2024.\n\nVanEck even suggests that one of the best altcoins for 2024 could be the layer 2 network that surpasses Ethereum in monthly DEX volume and total value locked (TVL).\n\nThis increase in efficiency is likely to attract more trading volume and arbitrage opportunities, making these L2 networks some of the most promising altcoins for 2024.\n\nSolana could make strides in 2024\n\nAccording to VanEck analysts, Solana (SOL) is expected to emerge as a top-three blockchain in terms of market cap, TVL, and active users. This rise is attributed to Solana\u2019s clear scalability roadmap, which may give it an edge over competitors like Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s defi ecosystem, already among the top five in TVL, has witnessed an impressive surge to around $1.5 billion as of January 2024 from $300 million levels in October.\n\nThis growth is spread across a vast number of wallet addresses and protocols, indicating a strong and active network.\n\nMoreover, VanEck analysts also predict that along with Bitcoin ETFs, several asset managers could file for Solana-based spot ETFs. This move could enhance Solana\u2019s visibility and attract further investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s expected growth in TVL through Pyth, a Solana-based price oracle, could help Solana gain a substantial market share.\n\nThese developments suggest that Solana could be one of the most promising altcoins for 2024. Its potential growth in market cap, TVL, and user base, along with its probable venture into ETFs could redefine altcoin future predictions, especially in the DeFi sector.\n\nMost promising altcoins for 2024\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s (XRP) ongoing lawsuit with the SEC remains a crucial factor for its future. As of January, Ripple had secured some partial victories in court, with a key ruling stating that past XRP sales were not investment contract offers.\n\nThis has provided Ripple with a temporary advantage in the case. The lawsuit is expected to be resolved in spring 2024, and a favorable outcome for Ripple could positively influence XRP\u2019s market value.\n\nThe anticipation of this resolution has been contributing to fluctuations in XRP\u2019s price, with notable buying activity from large-scale investors hinting that it could positively impact altcoin\u2019s price prediction.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been making strides as a decentralized platform for building and launching custom blockchain applications.\n\nIts consensus mechanism aims to enable rapid transaction finality and low transaction fees, making it an attractive platform for developers.\n\nThe growth of the defi market in 2024 could benefit AVAX, especially as it offers a scalable and user-friendly platform alternative to more established blockchains like Ethereum\u200b\u200b, making it one of the most promising altcoins.\n\nLido DAO (LIDO)\n\nLido DAO (LIDO) has gained significant attention due to its role in liquid staking, particularly on the Ethereum network. It has become a major contributor to Ethereum\u2019s TVL, highlighting its growing importance in the DeFi space.\n\nThe success and innovations in liquid staking and its impact on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem put LIDO in the race to become one of the best altcoins for 2024.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot\u2019s (DOT) parachain feature has been a key factor in its growth. This feature allows multiple blockchains to connect and interact within the Polkadot network while maintaining their independent operations.\n\nThe potential for interoperability and the facilitation of cross-chain communication could make DOT one of the best-performing altcoins for 2024\u200b.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe altcoin forecast for 2024 appears both promising and challenging. Investors eyeing the best altcoins for 2024 should remain vigilant, considering the volatile nature of the crypto market.\n\nFor those seeking the most promising altcoins for 2024, it\u2019s essential to look beyond just the hype and deeply analyze the technological advancements, market trends, and regulatory shifts that could impact these digital assets.\n\nYou must exercise caution as the crypto market is notoriously fast-paced. While the potential for high returns is significant, so is the risk of loss.\n\nHappy investing, and don\u2019t forget the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the best altcoins to buy in 2024? Looking towards 2024, some of the best altcoins to consider for investment include the ones that match your risk appetite and investment goals. You should conduct thorough research and stay updated with the latest market trends when considering these most promising altcoins for 2024. Are altcoins a good investment? Altcoins can be a good investment, but they also come with a high level of risk due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Due diligence, ongoing market research, and a careful altcoin forecast approach are key to making informed decisions in this space. Which altcoins can explode in 2024? Predicting which altcoins will explode in 2024 involves speculation, but based on current trends and developments, altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple, Avalanche, Lido DAO, and Polkadot show considerable promise. However, the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and investors should keep an eye on market trends to identify the best altcoins for 2024."
