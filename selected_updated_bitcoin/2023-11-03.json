        "content": "A trader who accurately predicted the crypto bottom in November of 2022 is expressing bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 54,100 YouTube subscribers that he foresees Bitcoin getting a \u201cmassive pump\u201d that will siphon funds from altcoins and into BTC.\n\nDonAlt says that Bitcoin could afterward consolidate, a move that would positively impact altcoins.\n\n\u201cAnd then you might see another [Bitcoin] consolidation like this [BTC ranging roughly between $33,400 and $35,200], another rotation into altcoins where people chase the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and then maybe we get a little bit of nice altcoin action.\u201d\n\nBTC is worth $35,223 at time of writing, after hitting a new 2023 high of just under $36,000 earlier in the day.\n\nOn the likely next course of action for Ethereum (ETH) over the short term, the trader says,\n\n\u201cETH\u2026 my view on it is I think there\u2019s a good chance it bounces in general like altcoin sentiment seems to be up, like people are kind of euphoric right now on the altcoin front, even though like they\u2019re only bouncing a tiny percentage of what they lost before. So as long as that maintains you could see a little bit of a bounce.\u201d\n\nETH is trading at $1,831 at time of writing.\n\nTurning to Solana (SOL), DonAlt says a buying opportunity could arise if and when the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap starts consolidating after the recent rally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real good pullback level to buy [Solana]. I think if it goes back to $30, that is scary. It\u2019s a pullback level but it\u2019s scarily close to where it\u2019s actually just full-blown invalidated. And it starts looking really shitty.\n\nOn this one, if this consolidates maybe you just buy the consolidation, like that\u2019s a pullback of sorts that I could see.\n\nOtherwise, if Bitcoin tops [out], this probably goes down. If Bitcoin rips, this probably just keeps on going.\u201d\n\nSOL is trading at $43.21 at time of writing, up by more than 30% over the past week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "NFTs Are Back? Sales Jump 32% in October, Led by Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto\u2019s JPEG market is showing signs of life\u2014despite mass layoffs at prominent marketplace OpenSea on Friday\u2014as NFT trading volume grew by $99 million in October compared to the month before, according to a report released by crypto data firm DappRadar.\n\n\u201cThe yearlong downward trend in NFT trading has been broken,\u201d DappRadar wrote, noting that NFT trading volume increased 32% from $306 million in September to $405 million last month. The firm described it as levels of sales not seen since August.\n\nNFTs are unique digital tokens that represent the ownership of an item, often digital art. While the market for NFTs was bubbly in 2021 and early 2022, this year has been tough for many profile picture (PFP) projects so far\u2014as hype for collections like Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) chills amid a prolonged crypto winter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, signs of warmth in the broader digital assets industry could be at play. The uptick in NFT trading volume came as the price of Bitcoin bounced above $35,000\u2014touching its highest price in 16 months on anticipation that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in the U.S. soon, analysts say.\n\nDappRadar\u2019s report highlighted Solana as a notable network in terms of growth. NFT trading volume on the speedy layer-1 grew 15% from $24 million to $27.6 million, DappRadar reported. Meanwhile, the price of Solana itself surged 65% in October, jumping from $23 to around $38, according to CoinGecko.\n\nNFT trading volumes across a breadth of blockchains that support the class of tokens are captured in DappRadar\u2019s report. And across all networks, a 50% jump in NFT trading volume on Ethereum\u2014crypto\u2019s second-largest coin\u2014kept it \u201cleading the pack,\u201d DappRadar said.\n\nAs the flow of JPEGs grew in October, the floor price\u2014or cheapest listed NFT on a secondary marketplace\u2014for some popular PFP projects increased as well. For example, the floor price of NFTs from the aforementioned Bored Ape Yacht Club rose from $40,000 worth of Ethereum to around $55,000.\n\nAn uptick in the price of PFP projects boasting large market capitalizations was recently touched on by Punk9059, director of research at NFT startup Proof. \u201cUptober has arrived,\u201d the pseudonymous researcher said on Twitter last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe've had 4 consecutive weeks of rising NFT volume. pic.twitter.com/GnuqmxA5xN \u2014 NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) November 3, 2023\n\nWhile DappRadar\u2019s report could provoke WAGMI-like hopes among some NFT traders, $405 million in NFT trading volume throughout October is a paltry sum compared to the $2 billion in JPEGs that traded hands in March. Additionally, NFT sales continued to slump last month.\n\nDespite the rise in trading value, the overall number of NFTs sold in October slid by 5%, from 3.58 million in September to 3.4 million last month, DappRadar reported. Still, the decrease was less severe than when NFT sales fell by 290,000 in August.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are two important reasons Ethereum could soar higher in 2024.\n\nDespite being up nearly 50% for the year, Ethereum (ETH 1.11%) seems to have fallen out of favor with investors. While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 2.47%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It's still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum's price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum's market dominance at a faster pace, it's safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that's exactly what I'm looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum's success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum's market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, \"If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?\" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn't some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don't forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn't have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it's still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You're getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang."
