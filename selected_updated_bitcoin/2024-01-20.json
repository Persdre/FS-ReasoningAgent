Due to this, Ethereum [ETH] got left behind and the correlation between the two coins witnessed a decline.\n\nParting ways\n\nAccording to Kaiko\u2019s data, the BTC to ETH correlation has fallen below its historical average of 0.71 for the first time since 2021. In recent months, the two cryptocurrencies have demonstrated divergent price movements, with BTC benefiting from ETF-related hype and speculation, while ETH underwent a comparatively subdued rally.\n\nFor the first time since 2021, the BTC:ETH correlation dropped below its all time average of 0.71.

Over the past 365 days, BTC has witnessed a robust 100% increase in returns, outpacing ETH\u2019s more modest 60% returns.\n\nHowever, a shift occurred on the day of BTC\u2019s approval, with BTC experiencing a decline and ETH rallying, fueled by the growing anticipation that ETH could be the next in line for such approval.\n\nIn the past week, ETH spot volume on Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) surged to its highest level since the FTX collapse.\n\nNotably, there was a substantial disparity in volume between ETH and altcoins, favoring ETH and representing the most significant gap since March 2023.\n\nThis surge in volume suggests heightened market activity and interest in ETH, potentially indicative of a changing dynamic within the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nDevelopments on Ethereum\n\nHowever, some factors may help generate interest in ETH in the next few months.\n\nApart from the potential approval of the Ethereum ETF, the new developments on the Ethereum network may also provide some hope to ETH holders.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nRecently, the Dencun upgrade was deployed on the Goerli testnet, further cementing the fact that the development teams progress in terms of development.\n\nMoreover, in the recent ACD call, discussions around deploying the Dencun upgrade on other testnets also ensued."
