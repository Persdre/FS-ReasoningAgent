        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been experiencing a lateral trading pattern for over a month, fluctuating between two key levels at $2400 and $2137. The appearance of daily candles with rejection wicks at both ends signifies a prevailing uncertainty among investors. Recently, a sharp market downturn, partly attributed to speculated rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the US SEC as reported by Matrixport, a digital asset financial services firm, resulted in a notable 6.5% drop in the ETH price. This decline led to the breach of a crucial support trendline, hinting at the risk of further corrections.\n\nIs Ethereum Headed for a Steeper Slide?\n\nA bearish breakdown below the support trendline hints at an early upcoming correction.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price should bolter buyers to revive exhausted bullish momentum,\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $19.3 Billion, indicating a 53% gain.\n\nOver the past eight weeks, the Ethereum price has shown signs of recovery, evident from an ascending trendline on the daily chart. This trendline has historically served as a strategic buying point for investors during market dips, indicative of a robust recovery.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, during the current period of consolidation, Ether has been facing substantial resistance at the $2400 mark. The recent downturn, coinciding with the broader market sell-off, pushed the price below both the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level and the established support trendline.\n\nIf the daily candlestick closes beneath this critical threshold, it could pave the way for sellers to exert additional downward pressure, potentially triggering a further 20% price decline, bringing the ETH price down to approximately $1750.\n\nEthereum Long-Term Holder Ratio Surpasses Bitcoin\n\nWhile current short-term trends suggest a cautious or downward trajectory for the Ethereum price, an analysis of the \u201cHolder Ratio\u201d chart presents a promising outlook for the cryptocurrency. In a retrospective of 2023, on-chain data from Intotheblock showcased on the X-platform, revealed that the proportion of long-term Ethereum holders exceeded that of Bitcoin for the second time. This vital statistic underscores a growing trend of Ethereum investors committing to hold their assets for extended periods, outpacing similar commitments among Bitcoin investors.
