        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong Could Lead to 'More Progressive' Policies in China: OSL - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAt the start of the week, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were conditionally approved in Hong Kong. Alongside this news, digital assets platform OSL announced it will be a \u201csub-custodian partner\u201d for both the China Asset Management, also known as ChinaAMC (HK), and Harvest Global Investment ETFs.\n\nLooking forward, OSL's CEO believes that these ETFs could lead to a wave of \u201cmore progressive\u201d regulation in China and potentially cause a ripple effect across the region.\n\n\u201c[It] is likely to set a precedent for other financial markets in Asia,\u201d Patrick Pan, Chairman of the Board and CEO of OSL, told Decrypt. \u201cFor China, this development in Hong Kong solidifies Hong Kong\u2019s place as a unique financial center for innovations and may influence future regulatory considerations and market openness towards crypto, potentially leading to more progressive policies aligned with global standards.\u201d\n\nChina has a long and rocky history with cryptocurrencies\u2014effectively banning crypto multiple times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresently, there are rigorous regulatory controls over cryptocurrency transactions, expressly prohibiting the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges within its territory,\u201d Thomas Zhu, the ChinaAMC (HK) head of digital assets and head of family office business, told Decrypt.\n\nBut with Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region controlled by China\u2014which has been called a \u2018testing ground\u2019 for China\u2014its financial decisions may set the table for future movements on mainland China.\n\nLooking at the wider continent, both firms see the approval of spot ETFs as a catalyst for regulatory evolution.\n\n\u201cIt may prompt regulators to accelerate their own frameworks to accommodate such products, which may lead to a broader acceptance and deeper integration of cryptocurrency into the Asian financial landscape,\u201d Zhu said, \u201cpotentially setting the stage for a new era of digital asset trading and investment in the region.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, crypto-friendly countries like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore could be the first to be influenced, Zhu suggested.\n\nThe United States approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January\u201411 years after the first application for a U.S. Bitcoin ETF was filed. This is a stark contrast to Hong Kong\u2019s process, which OSL said has only taken four months.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., where the legal framework and regulatory landscape have been highly fragmented\u2014and at times, vulnerable to highly polarized political cycles\u2014the journey for spot crypto ETF products has been far more arduous.\u201d Pan told Decrypt. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s framework has managed to prove once again that it can be mobilized quickly to innovate, while ensuring robust investor protection, setting a benchmark for crypto-related financial products in Asia.\u201d\n\nDespite this, the U.S. still beat Hong Kong to the punch. That means Hong Kong regulators and potential ETF issuers have been able to study the impact that spot crypto funds might have on the market. One primary lesson: ETFs significantly drive demand. The firms that spoke to Decrypt think it will be no different this time around.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a similar uplift in Hong Kong,\u201d Pan said. \u201cGiven the structured and familiar investment mechanism of these ETFs, akin to those in traditional finance, they are likely to facilitate education and adoption among local investors. This positions the Hong Kong market to potentially experience substantial growth, tapping into a deep well of enthusiasm and capital.\u201d\n\nWith Hong Kong\u2019s population a fraction of the size of the U.S., its impact on the wider crypto ecosystem is likely to be less pronounced than January\u2019s spot ETF approvals. But the ripple effect it could have on China and the rest of Asia may dwarf anything the U.S. could muster.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott and Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "BlobScriptions: A New Type of Inscription on Ethereum - Unchained",
        "content": "BlobScriptions made waves in the Ethereum community as a new type of inscription, similar to Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum blockchain underwent the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, introducing a concept called Blobs. Blobs are a novel data storage concept intended to lower transaction costs on layer 2 scaling solutions. While the concept was intended primarily to lower costs, some creators used blobs to develop \u201cBlobScriptions.\u201d\n\nRead on to learn what BlobScriptions are, how they work, and their similarities to Bitcoin inscriptions.\n\nWhat Are BlobScriptions?\n\nBlobScriptions are Ethscriptions that use EIP-4844 blobs to store additional data. Blobs, or binary large objects, were introduced to the network in the latest Ethereum network upgrade in March as a cost-effective solution for storing data on-chain. However, their \u2018misuse\u2019 is now dubbed BlobScriptions.\n\nTom Lehman and Michael Hirsch developed the concept by launching BlobScriptions.io, a platform enabling anyone to inscribe data onto a blob.\n\nTheir proposal, ESIP-8, was to use blobs to store data within the Etherscriptions Protocol, enabling data storage and allowing users to access blob data alongside other blockchain data currently utilized by the protocol.\n\nLehman said the idea was a means of democratizing blobs, making them available for everyone. For a fee of about $20, anyone, potentially including bots, can submit a BlobScription since blobs have made data storage on Ethereum 10x to 100x cheaper.\n\nHow Do BlobScriptions Work?\n\nBlobScriptions function similarly to Bitcoin inscriptions, allowing users to store various data types on Ethereum\u2019s blobs, including images, text, and even tokens. Blobs are unique because they don\u2019t interact with smart contracts, and nodes only need to store them for up to 18 days, making them cost-effective.\n\nWhen sharing data using blobs, one requires the content itself and the content type. Initially, data URIs were used to achieve this, but to make BlobScriptions cheaper; its creators implemented CBOR, which natively supports binary data.\n\nOnce the BlobScription payload is prepared, it needs to be split into one or more blobs, each consisting of 32-byte segments. These blobs are then sent as transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethscriptions indexer, Ethereum RPC, and the Beacon API are then used to retrieve blobs. Using their versioned hashes, the blobs can be associated with individual transactions.\n\nAfter retrieving a transaction\u2019s blobs, they can be decoded and concatenated into a single binary value using Viem\u2019s \u201cfromBlobs\u201d method. This decoded data includes the content and content type, forming an \u201cEthscription Attachment,\u201d also called a BlobScription. The indexer can then serve the attachment content via its API.\n\nRegarding the concern about blobs being removed from storage after 18 days, Ethscriptions indexers and other decentralized data stores retain the data, ensuring that as long as someone has it, the BlobScriptions can still be used.\n\nHow to Create a BlobScription on Ethereum\n\nTo create a BlobScription on Ethereum, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Visit the BlobScription Website\n\nYou need to first visit the BlobScription website to begin the process. Click on \u201cCreate a burner for me.\u201d This creates a new wallet and imports the private key to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask.\n\nAfter importing, double-check if the displayed address matches your own.\n\nStep 2: Enter the Initial Owner\n\nThe next step requires you to specify the individual or entity credited with creating the BlobScription on the blockchain.\n\nStep 3: Choose a File\n\nYou will then select the data you want to store on the Ethereum blockchain via the BlobScription.\n\nStep 4: Create BlobScription\n\nClick the \u201cCreate BlobScription\u201d button to finalize the process, and you have successfully created your first BlobScription!\n\nBlobScriptions vs. Bitcoin Inscriptions: Similarities & Differences\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the similarities and differences between BlobScriptions and Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions.\n\nHere are some of the aspects in which they are similar:\n\nData storage purpose: BlobScriptions and Ordinal inscriptions allow users to embed data directly onto the blockchain. This data could include text, images, or any other digital content.\n\nImmutable storage: Once data on BlobSriptions and Ordinal inscriptions is embedded, it becomes part of the blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger. Hence, the data cannot be altered or deleted.\n\nStill, BlobScriptions and Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions have several differences, as outlined in the tale below.\n\nFeature BlobScriptions Bitcoin Inscriptions Blockchain Ethereum Bitcoin Data storage On Ethereum\u2019s blobs On the Bitcoin blockchain Introduced After Dencun upgrade in March 2024 After Taproot upgrade Transaction type Data is inscribed onto blobs Data is attached to individual satoshis (sats) Cost Cost-effective as blob transactions have lower fees compared to calldata transactions Bitcoin Inscription fees depend on the size of the data being inscribed Permanence Data is temporary on Ethereum\u2019s main network and may be preserved by external indexers Data remains on the Bitcoin blockchain indefinitely\n\nFinal Word\n\nMany Ethereum enthusiasts anticipate that the hype and use of BlobScriptions will be short-lived.\n\nAccording to Jim McDonald, co-founder of Ethereum staking provider Attestant, there\u2019s an expectation that the pricing of blobs for layer 2 solutions will become more reasonable for their intended purpose over time. This could render Ethereum too costly for those seeking to utilize it merely as a \u201cgraffiti wall.\u201d\n\nHowever, if BlobScriptions continue to gain traction or remain stable, the price of layer 2 solutions, significantly reduced by the March software upgrade, might increase more rapidly than anticipated. This could necessitate the development of new tools, and additional upgrades could be needed to lower the prices."
