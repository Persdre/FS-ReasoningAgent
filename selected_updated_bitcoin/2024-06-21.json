        "title": "Ethereum wins a major battle, but its war with the SEC is far from over - Fortune",
        "content": "Consensys, the maker of the popular MetaMask crypto wallet, announced this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission has backed off its unpopular campaign to investigate developers who use Ethereum. The move is in line with the growing legal consensus that Ethereum is a commodity, not a security, which puts it outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. The announcement, however, also contained a dark lining that reveals SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s crusade against Ethereum is far from over.\n\nYou may recall that things between Consensys and the SEC came to a head when the company took the bold step of suing in April, asking a federal judge to force the agency to back off. The lawsuit came as a preemptive strike after the SEC had telegraphed it was on the verge of filing charges against the company after a year-long campaign of issuing subpoenas to developers who use Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s legal position became tenuous after the agency, under growing political pressure, approved Ethereum ETFs\u2014an acknowledgement the currency is indeed a commodity. In response to an enquiry from Consensys, the SEC then informed the company it was \u201cclosing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\u201d The \u201c2.0\u201d phrase appears to be a reference to the blockchain\u2019s new proof-of-stake system that went into effect in 2022.\n\nAll of this came as good news to the market, and the price of Ethereum jumped around 3%. But one line in Consensys\u2019s announcement hinted that all was not quite as well as it seemed\u2014namely that its lawsuit with the SEC was ongoing. This seemed strange given that, if Ethereum is not a security, the SEC has no jurisdiction and there is nothing to hash out in court.\n\nI asked Consensys\u2019s lawyers what is going on and they told me the SEC is still going after MetaMask because it can be used to swap tokens on the DeFi market, and also because it offers access to staking\u2014a key element of Ethereum that pays users to help secure the network. Here is how the lawyers put it:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s theory is that, because the Swaps offering allows users to trade various tokens using DeFi platforms, it is a securities broker due to at least some of those tokens being securities. They also assert that providing a user interface to two liquid staking protocols is also brokerage activity, and that it also constitutes offering unregistered crypto asset securities. The closing of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation doesn\u2019t resolve those issues.\u201d\n\nThe SEC, in other words, is trying to argue that Consensys\u2014and by extension other firms\u2014is an unlicensed brokerage engaged in the securities trade. This is likely a losing argument too, but it\u2019s on brand for Gensler, who has treated the process of crypto regulation like a personal vendetta, to dig in to the bitter end. The upshot for the crypto industry is it has won another battle, but the war goes on.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating Jump\u2019s crypto trading activities.

        "content": "Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire? Cathie Wood's Ether ETF Pullback And Her $20 Trillion Market Cap Prediction\n\nEarlier in the year, Bitcoin dominated financial headlines thanks to its recent halving and the emergence of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) boosting its demand. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest made a bullish prediction that Ethereum (ETH) may soon catch up to Bitcoin and potentially offer investors significant returns in the years ahead.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nDogecoin millionaires are increasing \u2013 investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\n\nSpeaking at Big Ideas, an investor conference hosted by Ark Invest, Wood shared her optimistic outlook on Ethereum. She projected that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could soar to $20 trillion by 2032. Given Ethereum\u2019s current supply of approximately 122 million tokens, this projection translates to a staggering per-token price of over $166,000. Moreover, since the Ethereum Foundation continues implementing token burns, this price could rise even further.\n\nAt the hypothetical price of $164,000 per token, holding six ETH would equate to a value of just under $1 million. In comparison, the current price for six ETHs is roughly $21,000. To put this into perspective, the total market capitalization of the S&P 500 is approximately $40 trillion, while the global value of above-ground gold reserves is estimated at around $16 trillion. While reaching a $20 trillion market cap is theoretically possible for Ethereum, such a milestone is likely far off, if it happens at all.\n\nWood\u2019s optimistic forecast is primarily grounded in Ethereum\u2019s potential for mainstream adoption. Today, Ethereum is mainly used to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which offer services ranging from borrowing and lending to storing health records.\n\nHowever, in 2024, DeFi remains predominantly focused on small-scale financial platforms. Wood argues that if Ethereum can expand its use cases to provide substantial user benefits, broader adoption could follow, potentially driving up the token\u2019s price.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nWood\u2019s projection, while ambitious, may partly be intended to generate excitement among investors about Ethereum\u2019s future. Despite the optimism, her forecast might not materialize as predicted. It\u2019s crucial to note that Wood has a vested interest in Ethereum\u2019s success. Ark Invest, her firm, already offers an Ethereum futures ETF (ARKZ).\n\nHowever, it was reported by Bloomberg that Ark Investment withdrew from issuing an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Previously, Ark had submitted an application for a spot in Ether ETF in partnership with 21Shares, but Ark\u2019s name has now been removed from the filing. Despite this withdrawal, Ark\u2019s official statement emphasized the company\u2019s continued belief in Ethereum's transformative potential and long-term value. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that the decision might have been influenced by the ongoing \"fees war\" in the market, which complicates profitability for issuers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough many believed that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs would bring a boost to ETH prices, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a surprising move to approve the sale of spot Ether ETFs last month, ETH continued to slump, nearly dipping under $3,000 per token earlier this month. We've seen an incredible bounce back earlier this week, peaking at nearly $4,000 before hovering at $3,500 again.\n\nAn increase in Ethereum\u2019s trading volume would benefit Wood, particularly in relation to Ark Invest\u2019s financial products. Despite this potential conflict of interest, many investors remain optimistic about ETH\u2019s future. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow and the possibility of spot Ethereum ETFs looms, there is considerable potential for ETH to achieve new price milestones.\n\nThis story was previously published on Benzinga and has been updated.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire?
