        "content": "Thu 07 Mar 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nEther (ETH), the second most popular cryptocurrency in the market, is drawing investors\u2019 attention due to its exceptional performance. Like bitcoin (BTC), which it follows, it has reached an all-time high price of $3,800. Here\u2019s how analysts explain this surge in power.\n\nThe reasons behind the surge of Ethereum\u2019s native crypto\n\nLike the price of bitcoin, ether has shown a remarkable surge in power. A dynamic that has recently taken the crypto to a valuation of $3,800. An absolutely historic record.\n\nWhile the question arises as to how the asset managed such a performance, Michael Van Pope, a well-known analyst in the crypto industry, gave his opinion on the matter. According to his view, ether\u2019s breakthrough is due to two factors.\n\nThe first is linked to expectations around Dencun. This is an upgrade that Ethereum is expected to undergo soon. An update that should address many of the platform\u2019s challenges in terms of transaction fees, scalability, and attractiveness.\n\nThe second factor behind the rise of ether comes from speculation about the potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF. An option that should improve the accessibility of institutional investors to this crypto, similar to what is observed with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEthereum Hits $3,800: Dencun Upgrade and ETF Hype Propel Surgehttps://t.co/JBS63Upqo3 \u2014 John Morgan (@johnmorganFL) March 7, 2024 Factors behind the rise of ether according to Michael Van Pope\n\nA surge that\u2019s just beginning?\n\nAnalyzing the dynamics of ether, Michael Van Pope highlights Ethereum\u2019s certain robustness relative to resistance levels. Moreover, the crypto seems to show a relatively stable behavior compared to bitcoin.\n\nThus, according to the analyst, ether is demonstrating remarkable resilience. It manages to progress in a more consistent manner. This suggests that it is in a solid position compared to bitcoin and the challenges of the crypto market in general.\n\nBased on this observation, he believes Ethereum is ready to achieve significant new gains in the coming weeks and months. These would also be driven by the Dencun upgrade and the possible approval of an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nIn essence, Michael Van Pope\u2019s projection is not new. In early February, he had notably anticipated a market explosion around Ethereum, driven not only by the two arguments previously mentioned but also by a reallocation of profits from BTC to ETH.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum worth $190 million was burned during the past week, effectively reducing the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Cancun-Deneb upgrade is scheduled to occur on March 13.\n\nWhales are accumulating the altcoin while retail investors and small-wallet holders appear to be taking profits following Ether\u2019s rally.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has increased sharply in the past week as investors appear to be pricing in the positive effects of the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the possibility that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves this year exchange-traded funds that track Ether. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that almost $200 million in ETH were burned in the past week, another indicator of further price gains as it reduces the circulating supply of the altcoin.\n\nEthereum holders are anticipating the two catalysts that are likely to drive ETH price rally this cycle. The upcoming Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Hard Fork and the SEC\u2019s decision on the Spot Ethereum ETF are the two catalysts for the altcoin.\n\nEthereum price is $3,790 at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price beats crypto market bloodbath nearly a week away from Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum price gains could be triggered by these catalysts\n\nEthereum price rally to the psychologically important $4,000 target and beyond could be catalyzed by the upcoming Dencun upgrade, an important technical improvement that resolves the scalability aspect of the so-called \u201cBlockchain Trilemma\u201d.\n\nThe Blockchain Trilemma is the trade-off between three important aspects: security, scalability and decentralization. Ethereum has prioritized decentralization and security, meaning that the scalability aspect can be improved with upgrades and Hard Forks to the blockchain.\n\nFind out more about why the Dencun upgrade is important and how it could reduce the transaction costs for Layer 2 chains, in this post.\n\nLooking at on-chain data, some indicators also signal upside momentum for Ethereum. The altcoin\u2019s circulating supply, which plays a role in gauging the asset\u2019s selling pressure, is declining. According to data from Ultrasound.money, $190 million worth of ETH was removed from the circulating supply by token burn.\n\nEther burned in the past week. Source: ultrasound.money\n\nAn analysis of the different cohorts of investors holding ETH, the so-called supply distribution, also signals the possibility of further price gains. While retail and small-wallet holders (those with 10 to 10,000 ETH) have shed their holdings and likely taken profits since the beginning of March, large-wallet investors are adding ETH to their holdings. Typically, whale accumulation has been a bullish sign for the asset and has preceded Ethereum price rally, as seen in the chart below.\n\n\n\nEthereum Supply Distribution. Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum Network Realized Profit/Loss. Source: Santiment\n\nETH holders are also awaiting the SEC\u2019s decision about the potential approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF. The US regulator has several applications on the table, and the deadline to decide about them is May 23. Ethereum traders believe that an approval could usher institutional capital inflow and catalyze gains in ETH, as it has happened with Bitcoin.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price is $3,790, up nearly 13% in the past week."

The amount of ETH in EigenLayer has popped 75% since January, from 1.7 million ETH to almost 3 million ETH right now.\n\nThere\u2019s 4.3 million ETH ($16.25 billion) in restaking apps overall, about 14% of the total ETH stake and over one-third of what\u2019s in liquid staking platforms.\n\nEigenLayer has sent users almost 2.4 billion points to date, part of an incentive system for future airdrops.\n\nThose points are selling for more than $0.15 per unit on Whales Market, effectively valuing the EigenLayer points market at nearly $360 million.\n\nThe ETH supply staked is more volatile since prices went up (source)\n\nCrypto business\n\nStocks across the crypto space found their footing Wednesday alongside bitcoin.\n\nBitfury-owned miner Cipher Mining surged more than 27% and held onto most of those gains after hours, propelled by strong Q4 earnings.\n\nMicroStrategy rallied 18.5% throughout the day \u2014 rounding out a 160% pump over the past month.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s surge came in response to its upsizing of a fresh convertible debt offering, from $600 million to $700 million (you guessed it \u2014 it plans to buy more bitcoin with it).\n\nMicroStrategy is up more than 100% on its bitcoin to date.\n\nThe firm already has $2.6 billion in liabilities after multiple rounds of corporate bond sales going back to 2021.\n\nTotal common shares outstanding for MSTR has nearly doubled across that period, from 7.623 million shares in December 2020 to 14.904 million at the end of last year.\n\nNot that markets seem to mind, MSTR\u2019s share price is up 750% since then.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s common share count has grown 38% since it went public in April 2021.\n\nCOIN has meanwhile swelled its cash pile from $4 billion to $5.71 billion per its latest disclosure.\n\nOn the ground\n\nLoading Tweet..
