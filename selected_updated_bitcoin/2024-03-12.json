        "title": "Punters put 79% odds on Ethereum all-time high even as ETF approval chances shrink - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum has a four-in-five chance of hitting a new record high in 2024, according to bettors on Polymarket.\n\nAt the same time, analysts and online punters\u2019 hopes for an Ethereum ETF approval are dwindling.\n\nSo what\u2019s driving the surge?\n\nOnline punters put the odds of Ethereum breaking a record this year at 79%, according to a bet on crypto predictions platform Polymarket. That\u2019s up from 31% in mid-February.\n\nYet bettors and analysts are putting slim chances of a Securities and Exchange Commission approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe deadline for an SEC decision on VanEck\u2019s application is on May 23.\n\nBettors on Polymarket give a spot Ethereum ETF a 31% chance of being approved, down from 82% at the beginning of January.\n\n\u201cI get all the reasons they should approve it \u2014 and we personally believe they should \u2014 but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish [two and a half months] out for Bitcoin spot are not there this time,\u201d Eric Balchunas said in a post on X.\n\nHe and his fellow Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart revised their approval odds to 35% on Monday, down from 70% in February.\n\nThe hope is that if and when spot Ethereum ETFs are approved, they will give the asset a similar growth as Bitcoin had on the back of ETFs in January.\n\nThe news comes as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $71,000 on Monday, with many wondering if Ethereum will follow suit.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEthereum surged to a yearly high above $4,070 on Monday and is up more than 60% over the last 30 days.\n\nEthereum reached a record $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nAnalysts have identified several key factors that could super-charge it to new peaks.\n\nThey include broad optimism, supply-side dynamics, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nSupply constraints\n\nAnother Ethereum tailwind: its shrinking supply due to tokens being locked up for staking, Pratik Kala, senior digital asset investment analyst at crypto fund manager DigitalX, told DL News on Monday.\n\n\u201cLess supply to go around is always bullish,\u201d Pratik said. \u201cThis also indicates strong long-term investor demand to buy/hold/stake ETH versus using it for short-term speculation.\u201d\n\nStaking in Ethereum parallels Bitcoin mining by generating additional tokens, verifying transactions, and safeguarding the blockchain.\n\nLocking up tokens for staking effectively means removed them from the circulating supply, which can lead to a decrease in the overall available supply.\n\nRoughly 26% of Ethereum\u2019s estimated circulating supply of more than 120 million tokens are locked away, according to blockchain explorer beaconcha.in.\n\nDencun upgrade\n\nInvestment bank JPMorgan and spot Bitcoin ETF provider Grayscale are among those that have identified the Dencun upgrade as a catalyst for Ethereum.\n\nThe upgrade, due Wednesday UK time, is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 platforms.\n\n\u201cWith layer 2 solutions built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain is becoming the settlement layer for a whole new digital infrastructure encompassing gaming, trading, and investing,\u201d Eugene Cheung, Bybit\u2019s head of institutions, told DL News earlier in March.\n\n\u201cThe value of all of this will tend to accrue to the ETH asset.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous headline misstated the Polymarket odds of an Ethereum record at 56%. It has been corrected to 79%.\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."
