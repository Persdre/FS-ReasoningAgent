        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin just gave a substantial amount to support the legal battle of Tornado Cash developers Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm.\n\nData from Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan shows that Buterin transferred 30 ETH worth $113,678 to the \u201cFree Alexey & Roman\u201d legal fund on May 30th.\n\nTornado Cash is an Ethereum-based coin mixing service that facilitates anonymous crypto transactions. In 2022, the US imposed a sanction on the platform claiming that it is used to launder illicit funds and pose a threat to national security.\n\nThe developers of Tornado Cash were subsequently charged. Earlier this month, a district court in the Netherlands sentenced Pertsev to 64 months in jail for laundering billions of dollars worth of crypto.\n\nUS authorities also arrested Storm last year. The Justice Department charged him and fellow developer Roman Semenov for allegedly helping the North Korean hacking group Lazarus launder their criminal proceeds.\n\nIn January, Storm asked for donations to help fund his legal defense, and in a video posted on the social media platform X, he said that the outcome of his trial would have significant implications on the future of digital assets.\n\nThe legal fund on the decentralized fundraising platform Juicebox has so far raised 597.07 ETH worth $2.25 million. The initiative says Roman and Alexey\u2019s legal expenses range between $90,000 and $100,000 per month.\n\n\u201cRoman and Alex need your help to build a strong defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. In response to the arrests, a group of sympathizers came together to form WeWantJusticeDAO to advocate on their behalf and help raise funds for legal defense.

        "content": "The balance of Ethereum (ETH) on centralized exchanges is dropping at a fast rate since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether ETF products.\n\nEthereum Liquidity Drain\n\nCentralized trading platforms are regarded as the primary avenue through which most traders get access to cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The availability of this coin is already being threatened as hinted by top market analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a recent post on X, Martinez noted that since the spot Ethereum ETF products were approved in the US, approximately 777,000 ETH, valued at about $3 billion have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges. While the ETH ETF products are yet to start trading officially on exchanges, a sustenance of this trend might play a major role in shaping the price action of ETH in the long term.\n\nOne intriguing trend in the chart shared by the analyst is that the current Ethereum balance on exchanges is the lowest the coin has recorded since at least December 11 2023. Judging by the massive rate of institutional investment in Bitcoin through its spot ETF products, Ethereum might suffer a supply shock in no time.\n\nShould Ether spot ETF experience a similar accumulation like Bitcoin, it can help shoot the price of Ethereum forward within a very short time. The same experience was recorded for Bitcoin as the corporate capital inflow dragged the price of the coin to a new All-Time High (ATH) above $73,000 in March.\n\nMany market analysts have postulated that all ETH need to breach its former ATH at $4,891.70 is the full launch of the spot Ethereum ETF product. Should the best case scenario play out, Standard Chartered postulates that the coin may soar to $8,000 by the end of this year.\n\nOther ETH Growth Catalysts\n\nBesides the spot ETF product, Ethereum also boasts of different fundamentals that can help drive its price in the long term. The digital currency is naturally deflationary with small amounts of the token scored from transaction fees burnt and taken away from circulation.\n\nAs a blockchain, Ethereum is also innovating in a remarkable way with different upgrades and innovation to make its Layer-2 protocols function optimally. When all this factors come together, chances are that the price of Ethereum will break free from its current stagnant trend to print a mega rally moving forward.\n\nRead More: Missed Pepe Coin, Here\u2019re 3 Ethereum Meme Coins To Buy In June\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs May Have Ended the SEC\u2019s War on Crypto - Decrypt",
        "content": "About the Author Carlo D\u2019Angelo is a lawyer, former law professor, and crypto and NFT enthusiast. Carlo\u2019s practice focuses on advising clients in all areas of blockchain technology law. Carlo is also the host of Lex Line, a weekly crypto and blockchain law podcast. The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMay\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the chef\u2019s kiss on what can only be described as a banner month for crypto policy\u2014and the move could severely undermine the SEC\u2019s ongoing crypto crackdown.\n\nAs the deadline to approve the Ethereum ETFs loomed, a bipartisan group of House of Representatives members sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler urging the Commission to not only approve the funds, but to also consider approval of \u201cother\u201d digital asset ETFs in the future. And finally, the SEC finally went public late on that fateful Thursday and announced approval of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nAccording to Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, the SEC\u2019s approval of spot ETFs effectively deems Ethereum (ETH) to be a commodity. If Grewal is correct in his assessment, then an ETH commodity would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as opposed to the SEC, which is tasked with regulating securities.\n\nThis is a key distinction for ETH, because the SEC\u2019s mandate is to police securities and protect investors. The CFTC instead regulates commodities such as raw materials and agricultural goods, with a focus on preventing market manipulation and fraud. The CFTC\u2019s regulatory framework over commodities is therefore generally less stringent compared to the SEC\u2019s treatment of securities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I\u2019ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we\u2019ve always known it to be. I\u2019m proud to be on team @Coinbase, the trusted partner and custodian for many of the issuers who had 19b-4\u2019s approved tonight. pic.twitter.com/nz1HHFbBSQ \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) May 23, 2024\n\nAs digital assets continue to gain mass adoption, there remains an ongoing debate over which federal agency should have jurisdiction over the regulation and enforcement of this new and innovative technology.\n\nBack in 2021, former CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump gave a speech on the now-infamous XRP SEC enforcement action case, and noted that she was \u201cwatching the outcome of this case closely because it will help to establish the scope of the SEC\u2019s authority in the digital assets space.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Stump added:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe regulatory application to digital assets, much like the assets themselves, is evolving every day. It is exciting, yet also frustrating to those who seek more certainty. But the incredible transformation in this space requires adaptation and creative thinking, and let\u2019s be honest, neither are among a regulator\u2019s natural tendencies. \u2026 That is where the regulatory state of digital assets currently sits: We must enable innovators to think creatively such that the story can evolve, we must acknowledge there will be differences of opinion as to the utility and potential of various products, and we must expect some storms to arise. These are the considerations that should guide us as regulators in exercising the authorities to fulfill our mission such that the market can develop and meet its full potential.\n\nPerhaps the Ethereum ETF approval brings just the sort of regulatory clarity this sector has been looking for. If ETH and other similar cryptocurrencies are not securities, then the SEC lacks jurisdiction to regulate these assets under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThat means that the SEC can no longer argue that these tokens are investment contracts under the Howey Test. If ETH and similarly situated tokens are commodities, then crypto lawyers could argue in court that these cryptocurrencies are not investment contracts that come with an \u201cexpectation of profits from the efforts of others\u201d\u2014critical elements that the SEC must prove under the Howey Test.\n\nCrucially, by tacitly acknowledging that Ethereum is a commodity, the SEC may have just undercut its own legal arguments raised in several pending crypto enforcement court cases.\n\nIf courts are receptive to ETH and potentially other cryptocurrencies being commodities, then this could turn the tide on pending SEC lawsuits against major crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Kraken. These lawsuits hinge on the SEC\u2019s argument that selected tokens traded on these platforms are securities. But if Ethereum and similarly situated tokens are instead commodities, then this could green light a renewed motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuits against both Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nIf the federal judges in these cases agree with this argument, then this would essentially gut the SEC\u2019s claims that both Coinbase and Kraken offer trading of unregistered securities.\n\nSuch a ruling would deal a devastating blow to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is already under intense scrutiny from critics who believe his aggressive approach to regulation by enforcement actions is stifling the growth of the digital asset technology sector in the United States\u2014and pushing innovation overseas to more favorable jurisdictions.\n\nAs noted in Grewal\u2019s recent Twitter (aka X) post, now that the SEC has effectively said that \u201cETH sales can\u2019t be securities because Ethereum ETFs may be registered by funds with an S-1,\u201d the SEC has essentially agreed that ETH has no more of an \u201c\u2018ecosystem\u2019 any more than does Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent approval of Ethereum ETFs has profound potential implications for both pending and future legal battles in the digital asset sector. By suggesting that ETH, and other similarly situated tokens are commodities, the SEC may have dramatically limited its power to aggressively police the crypto sector.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Ethereum ETF decision may therefore further embolden players in the digital asset sector to push back against overzealous enforcement actions, resulting in fewer settlements and more court battles.\n\nGetting long-awaited clarity on whether ETH is a security or commodity may also curtail the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction over Ethereum and other similarly situated cryptocurrencies. This could in turn lead to a dramatic narrowing of the SEC\u2019s regulatory reach in the digital asset sector. Crypto lawyers will no doubt use the ETF decision to aggressively push back against pending SEC enforcement actions and lawsuits, and argue that the agency has overstepped its mandate.\n\nIf more digital assets are treated as commodities similar to what the Ethereum ETF decision suggests, then legislators may finally pass laws to vastly curtail the SEC\u2019s reach over these assets. As a result, these tokens could be subject to potentially less stringent regulation under the CFTC. Such a shift in agency oversight would create fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto startups, and foster a new wave of innovation in this sector.\n\nCrypto lawyers will likely leverage the ETF decision to reshape existing strategies with respect to how they advise clients in the digital asset space. These strategies may include advising crypto sector clients to place greater emphasis on the commodity nature of their tokens and platforms, in an effort to better insulate them from the SEC\u2019s reach.\n\nIf the Coinbase and Kraken legal defense teams are successful in dismissing pending SEC lawsuits based on the Ethereum ETF decision, then this could generate highly favorable legal precedents that would influence future regulation of the digital asset sector\u2014and usher in a fresh wave of blockchain innovation in the U.S.\n\nA new era of clarity with respect to digital asset laws would also benefit investigators and lawyers employed within both the SEC and the CFTC, by creating a potentially more predictable and stable regulatory environment. This would result in a more efficient use of agency resources, as opposed to the legally ambiguous environment we currently operate under. Regulatory clarity would also bring much-needed consistency for the judges who preside over digital asset cases, and generate more consistent and predictable outcomes.\n\nIt\u2019s my firm belief that crypto lawyers are the guardians of the blockchain, and play a vital role in the continued growth and adoption of crypto technology in the United States. The recent Ethereum ETF decision will only further empower crypto lawyers to better advise and navigate clients in the digital asset sector\u2014and I\u2019m excited to see how they creatively use this opportunity to do just that.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"
