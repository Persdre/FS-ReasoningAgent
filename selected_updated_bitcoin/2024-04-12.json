Bitcoin, BNB , Solana, Dogecoin , and Cardano showed gains, trading up to 2% higher. Meanwhile, Ethereum, XRP , Toncoin, Internet Computer, and Uniswap experienced losses, trading 1-3% lower.The global cryptocurrency market cap rose marginally by 0.13% to around $2.64 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was up 0.7% at $71,025 as of 11:03 a.m., while Ethereum was below the $3,550 level.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"Bitcoin has climbed back above $70,000, a level not seen since March 25th in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin Halving. The $71,200 level presents the next resistance, with support at $69,100. If current momentum persists and buying interest holds steady, Bitcoin may retest its previous all-time high.\"Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch, said, \"BTC continues to trade above its newly found base at $70k. However, Bitcoin\u2019s 7-day average mining hashrate has started approaching its ATH value, increasing the mining difficulty by 4%. An increased hashrate results in increased security for the network. This may bring buying pressure for BTC, with potential resistance at around $71.2k.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $7.54 billion, 9.56% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $72.24 billion, which is 91.65% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, rose to $1.396 trillion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.97%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours fell 26% to $30.3 billion.Technical indicators such as the 30-day moving average and relative strength index suggest increasing momentum without entering overbought territory. Converging resistance and support levels indicate a significant move forward, potentially fueled by a halving.Analysts anticipate a short-term sell-off after the halving but expect long-term price appreciation due to reduced supply. With BTC only 4% off its all-time high, projections suggest it could reach $75,000 by May and $80,000 to $90,000 by Q3 2024."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amidst the turbulent seas of the crypto markets, Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) find themselves navigating stormy waters, facing challenges in their quest for a new rally. Despite efforts to regain solid footing, both ETH and SHIB encounter obstacles that hinder their upward momentum. In stark contrast, Furrever Token (FURR) emerges as a beacon of success, surpassing the impressive milestone of $770,000 in fundraising within just one month. While ETH and SHIB grapple with market dynamics, FURR's rapid ascent highlights its growing appeal and investor confidence in its promising trajectory.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Could See $4,000 Again Soon\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $3,502.22, marking a nearly 1% increase since yesterday. Despite recent fluctuations, Ethereum's price chart suggests signs of potential recovery, with indicators like the 30-day moving average stabilizing and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbing from 30 to approximately 45, indicating momentum.\n\nThe recent bounce-back of Ethereum's support level is also a positive indicator, alongside a doubling of trading volume, indicating heightened market activity. This surge in volume, potentially due to large investors' selling pressure, is encouraging as it hasn't significantly impacted Ethereum's price.\n\nConsidering the broader crypto market conditions, Ethereum seems poised for positive performance in the near and long term. It's expected to benefit from potential rallies following Bitcoin's upcoming halving event. Additionally, the potential approval of spot-based Ethereum ETFs could be a significant development, similar to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs on BTC's price.\n\nEthereum's robust fundamentals, particularly its significant share in the total value locked (TVL) aspect of the market, suggest it's primed for a substantial uptrend. This could see Ethereum reaching levels around $4,000 in the coming weeks and potentially $5,000 in the second half of the year.\n\nDespite experiencing a 5% increase over the past week, Ethereum saw a 12.5% decline last month. However, it's important to note that Ethereum saw an 89% increase over the past year.\n\nAnalyzing Shiba Inu (SHIB): Consolidation, Potential Opportunities, and Market Indicators\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at around $0.00002737, reflecting a 1% decrease since yesterday. The popular meme token has been in a phase of retreat and consolidation over the past six weeks. However, the cryptocurrency's price movement chart hasn't shown any reasons for investors to panic. On the contrary, experts suggest that a further 15% drop in SHIB's price could present a good buying opportunity.\n\nA recent report on Shibarium revealed a decline in transaction fees on the network, which could raise concerns about diminishing user activity and a potential decrease in demand. The 12-hour price chart for the meme token has highlighted the significance of the $0.00003 level since March 15. Bulls briefly turned to support in the last week of March but failed to hold, with the latest bounce also stopping just below this level at $0.00000295.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) underscores the indecision with a reading of 47, while the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains similarly uncertain. Notably, the cryptocurrency's price action and indicators indicate that SHIB is in a consolidation phase. CMF movement could potentially signal increasing buying (or selling) pressure and an imminent SHIB movement in that direction.\n\nThe 30-day MVRV ratio dipped into negative territory earlier this month, suggesting the token may be undervalued. Conversely, the average cryptocurrency age has shown a strong upward trend since early March, particularly signaling a robust buying signal due to strengthening under resistance levels.\n\nOpen positions have also significantly decreased in the last ten days. While the average cryptocurrency age rapidly declined in early March, stagnant circulation has largely increased since then. This quietness in stagnant circulation may signal a lack of significant selling pressure and token movement in recent weeks.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Soars: How it Amassed $770,000 in a Month with Up to 15X Returns\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) surged to amass over $730,000 in just one month, propelled by a strategic blend of captivating marketing, unique tokenomics, and a robust community-driven ethos. With an enticing offer of up to 15X returns and a current price of $0.00048, FURR's presale phase garnered significant attention and investment.\n\nThe token's allure stems from its innovative vision to inject the crypto sphere with an irresistible dose of cuteness, providing users with a delightful and charming experience distinct from conventional blockchain ventures. FURR's presale strategy strategically allocated 65% of tokens to early investors, incentivizing participation and capitalizing on the potential for substantial returns. Additionally, the dedication to lock 10% of tokens for a year underscored a steadfast commitment to project longevity, instilling confidence and stability within the community.\n\nFURR's engagement initiatives, including regular challenges, launch events, and growth endeavors, fostered a vibrant and inclusive community atmosphere. The integration of adorable cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals into the ecosystem further enhanced user engagement, attracting a diverse audience beyond traditional crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe absence of buy and sell taxes during trading streamlined transactions, while the active presence of admins and moderators on platforms like Telegram ensured prompt resolution of queries and issues, bolstering trust and credibility.\n\nOverall, Furrever Token's captivating concept, strategic tokenomics, stringent security measures, and active community involvement propelled its rapid fundraising success, positioning it as a promising contender in the crypto landscape.\n\n\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact: Robert Smith support(at)furrevertoken.com https://furrevertoken.com/\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve with significant movements in key digital currencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the emerging Furrever Token (FURR) . This article provides a detailed analysis of these cryptocurrencies, highlighting their current market positions, underlying value propositions, and potential future directions.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's Market Value: A Comparative Analysis\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the value of a single bitcoin reached an impressive milestone, exceeding $70,000, with a specific value of $70,665. The total circulation of bitcoin at this time was over 19.68 million, culminating in a market capitalization exceeding $1.39 trillion. This marks a significant increase from the previous year, where the market cap was around $472 billion with approximately 19.35 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nTo understand the proportion of global wealth represented by bitcoin, it's crucial to consider the overall monetary wealth. According to calculations by Credit Suisse, global wealth was estimated at $454.4 trillion by the end of 2022. Assuming a steady growth rate, the total global wealth by 2024 would be around $469.8 trillion, placing bitcoin at 0.3% of this figure.\n\nGold has traditionally been seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset. With an estimated 244,000 tons of gold discovered to date and a price per ounce of $2,334.90 as of April 10, 2024, the total value of all gold amounted to approximately $18.23 trillion. In this context, bitcoin's total value represented about 7.6% of the total value of all gold.\n\nWhile bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, it is far from the only one. Including other major cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Monero, and Ethereum, the total market cap for cryptocurrencies was around $2.6 trillion as of April 10, 2024. This constituted roughly 0.56% of the total global money supply.\n\nCryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are known for their volatility, liquidity issues, and susceptibility to price manipulation. Potential investors are advised to thoroughly understand the risks associated with these digital assets.\n\nBitcoin, as a pioneering cryptocurrency, occupies a unique position in the global financial ecosystem. Its comparison to traditional assets like gold highlights its growing relevance and potential as a store of value, despite constituting a small fraction of the world's total monetary wealth. As the digital currency landscape evolves, bitcoin continues to be a significant player, reflecting broader trends in the move towards virtual assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's Price Recovery: A Path to $3,600\n\nEthereum has shown resilience by holding above the crucial $3,400 support zone, indicating a possible recovery from recent losses. However, to sustain an upward trajectory in the near term, it must breach the $3,600 mark.\n\nThe digital currency witnessed a downturn, dipping below the $3,500 threshold and momentarily breaching the $3,450 support level. Ethereum found its lowest point at $3,408 before initiating a recovery, paralleling Bitcoin's upward movement. This recovery saw Ethereum surpass the $3,500 resistance, reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from its previous high of $3,726 to its low of $3,408. Additionally, Ethereum managed to break through a downward trend line on the ETH/USD hourly chart, signaling a potential reversal of the bearish trend.\n\nEthereum currently hovers around the $3,500 mark, closely aligned with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, suggesting a balanced market sentiment. Immediate resistance is identified near $3,600, correlating with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent high to low swing.\n\nShould Ethereum overcome the $3,650 resistance, it might target the $3,725 level, setting the stage for a possible move towards $3,780. A decisive break above $3,800 could catalyze a bullish momentum, possibly propelling the price to the $3,880 zone and, in an optimistic scenario, to the $4,000 mark.\n\nConversely, failure to surpass the $3,600 resistance could trigger a new round of selling. Immediate support is found near $3,520, with significant support at the $3,500 and $3,400 levels. A breach below $3,400 might lead to a decline towards $3,320, and further losses could potentially push the price down to $3,240.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: A Charming Alternative in the Cryptocurrency World\n\nIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves as an innovative alternative to the more traditional altcoins. Standing out with a unique blend of charm and community spirit, FURR is distinguishing itself amidst giants like Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat sets Furrever Token apart is its commitment to adding a touch of charisma to the crypto industry. Moving beyond mere transactions and functionalities, FURR captures the hearts of its users with enchanting digital cat imagery, offering an enjoyable and lighthearted experience. This not only differentiates FURR from its counterparts but also fosters a sense of community and collective enjoyment among its enthusiasts.\n\nAt its heart, Furrever Token prioritizes creating a welcoming and inclusive community. The introduction of cat-themed visuals, stickers, and emojis into its platform not only enhances user engagement but also promotes a sense of unity and camaraderie among its members. This focus on community building is a cornerstone of FURR's strategy, making it more than just a cryptocurrency but a shared experience.\n\nFurrever Token's approach to token distribution is equally impressive, with about 9 billion tokens in total supply. A significant 65% of these tokens are allocated for a presale, aimed at ensuring a broad and fair distribution. Additionally, locking 10% of the total supply for a year underscores the team's dedication to the project's longevity and the trust of its community.\n\nThe market has responded favorably to Furrever Token, with over $720,000 raised within a month of its launch. This remarkable feat underscores FURR's growing appeal and its viability as an investment in the crypto market. With its price currently at $0.00048, Furrever Token demonstrates a steadily increasing value, attracting the attention of investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) presents a compelling case for those looking for an alternative in the cryptocurrency space. Through its unique charm, strong community focus, and thoughtful tokenomics, FURR is carving out a niche for itself against competitors like Solana and Ethereum. As it continues to build momentum, Furrever Token stands as a testament to the potential of innovative and engaging approaches in the world of digital currencies.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe cryptocurrency market remains a dynamic and complex ecosystem, with Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to dominate the landscape, while new entrants like Furrever Token offer fresh perspectives and opportunities. As these digital currencies evolve, they reflect broader trends towards virtual assets and the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. Investors and enthusiasts alike are advised to stay informed and consider the unique characteristics and potential of each cryptocurrency.

However, to sustain an upward trajectory in the near term, it must breach the $3,600 mark.\n\nThe digital currency witnessed a downturn, dipping below the $3,500 threshold and momentarily breaching the $3,450 support level. Ethereum found its lowest point at $3,408 before initiating a recovery, paralleling Bitcoin's upward movement. This recovery saw Ethereum surpass the $3,500 resistance, reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from its previous high of $3,726 to its low of $3,408. Additionally, Ethereum managed to break through a downward trend line on the ETH/USD hourly chart, signaling a potential reversal of the bearish trend.\n\nEthereum currently hovers around the $3,500 mark, closely aligned with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, suggesting a balanced market sentiment. Immediate resistance is identified near $3,600, correlating with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent high to low swing.\n\nShould Ethereum overcome the $3,650 resistance, it might target the $3,725 level, setting the stage for a possible move towards $3,780. A decisive break above $3,800 could catalyze a bullish momentum, possibly propelling the price to the $3,880 zone and, in an optimistic scenario, to the $4,000 mark.\n\nConversely, failure to surpass the $3,600 resistance could trigger a new round of selling. Immediate support is found near $3,520, with significant support at the $3,500 and $3,400 levels. A breach below $3,400 might lead to a decline towards $3,320, and further losses could potentially push the price down to $3,240.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: A Charming Alternative in the Cryptocurrency World\n\nIn the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves as an innovative alternative to the more traditional altcoins.
