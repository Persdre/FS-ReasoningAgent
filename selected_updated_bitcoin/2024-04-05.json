        "title": "Lido\u2019s Ethereum Staking Market Share Falls Below 30% - Crypto Times",
        "content": "The surge in Ethereum stakers has prompted a decrease in Lido\u2019s market share, dropping from 32% in December 2023 to 29.57% currently. This decline has alleviated concerns surrounding Lido\u2019s dominance in the ecosystem.\n\nLido\u2019s dominance in ETH staking, combined with limited competition, allowed it to command a significant portion of the market. However, community apprehension grew due to the potential influence of any entity holding over 33% of the market share on the Ethereum chain.\n\nAccording to data from Dune, as of April 4, Lido\u2019s market share in staked ETH has fallen below the 30% mark.\n\nETH stakers: Dune Analytics\n\nCrypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, along with Ethereum staking platform Kiln, play significant roles in ETH staking, holding 14.04%, 3.75%, and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nSurprisingly, an unidentified entity occupies the second-largest share at 16.9%. Among the 26 known entities, Kraken, Bitcoin Suisse, OKX, and Upbit also contribute, with shares ranging from 1.1% to 2.4%.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, advocates for stake pools to cap their control at 15% and adjust fees accordingly to maintain this threshold.\n\nThe Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) community attempted to address the issue of Ethereum (ETH) staking dominance by proposing a hard limit in May 2022. However, the proposal was rejected by the DAO with a 99.81% vote in June 2022.\n\nThe intensifying competition among Ethereum (ETH) staking service providers is anticipated to significantly contribute to the continued decentralization of the staking ecosystem."

        "content": "Coinbase and Zodia Custody act as custodians for the digital assets underlying the ETCs.\n\nShare this article\n\nDWS Group (DWS), an asset management firm managing almost \u20ac900 billion in assets, has partnered with Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. to introduce two new Xtrackers exchange-traded commodities (ETCs): the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC securities and the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC securities. These new ETCs are now listed on Deutsche B\u00f6rse, as DWS shared in a recent press release.\n\nAn exchange-traded commodity (ETC) functions as a debt security similar to an exchange-traded note (ETN) but with added protections for investors. These protections include collateral, limited recourse, and bankruptcy remote issuer. Unlike ETNs, ETCs can track single assets or smaller, focused baskets of assets.\n\nAccording to Manfred Bauer, Global Head of DWS\u2019 Product Division and Member of the Executive Board at DWS Group, the growing value of Bitcoin and Ethereum is making it impossible for investors and financial institutions to simply ignore them. With this launch, DWS seeks to provide investors with direct access to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u201cSince the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009, digital assets have developed from a niche technology innovation to a globally recognized asset class. With a combined market capitalization of more than USD 1.7 trillion, Bitcoin and Ethereum alone are now too significant for investors and asset managers to ignore,\u201d stated Bauer.\n\nThe strategic partnership between DWS and Galaxy aims to accelerate digital asset adoption in Europe, leveraging their collective expertise, noted DWS. Through this collaboration, Galaxy will equip DWS with the tools and expertise to offer institutional-grade access to digital assets for European investors.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be working with Xtrackers to offer investors institutional-grade access to digital assets and to support them with our deep digital asset expertise,\u201d commented Steve Kurz, Global Head of Asset Management at Galaxy.\n\nAs noted in the press release, each ETC is supported by segregated offline storage solutions provided by Zodia Custody and Coinbase, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets.\n\nWith an annual product fee of just 0.35%, DWS expects that these ETCs will be a cost-effective option for investors looking to tap into the digital asset market. The firm claims that its new products will offer the ease of trading an ETP with the perceived safety of having an underlying physical asset."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has retreated from its recent highs, triggering a broader sell-off across the cryptocurrency market. However, Ethereum (ETH-USD), which typically moves in tandem with bitcoin, is plummeting at a rate nearly double the decline in bitcoin prices.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jared Blikre breaks down the details, explaining the relationship between bitcoin and Ethereum prices.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: --morning, Bitcoin holding above $66,000, nearing just shy of those record highs. Some investors may be a bit concerned, though, that the rally has stalled just a bit at these levels. Now above 67,000. So what's next for crypto? Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre here to break it all down. Jared, give us the tea.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, Seana, what I want to highlight here is Bitcoin is green, just barely. It's up a whopping four basis points. But Ethereum in the upper right, that is down 2.34%. And I want to show you what's happened over the last week. You'll see Bitcoin is down 3%. Ethereum is down 6%. So Ethereum is down twice as much as Bitcoin. And there are people who track the ratio of Ethereum to Bitcoin and that chart is actually at a level which is kind of raising a lot of eyebrows. So you can in technical analysis have something called a golden cross or a death cross. A death cross is when a short-term moving average the 50 passes below the 200, and all it is a long-term trend indicator.\n\nAll it indicates is that the existing state of affairs may continue into the future. So the concern is that if Bitcoin is outperforming by a wide margin Ethereum, Ethereum a proxy for the altcoins that there's just not as interest as much in crypto anymore as a whole. And Bitcoin, being the leader in the group, is expected to retain its value as the others sell off. So let me sort this by performance. And I can illustrate it this way. You can see in the lower we've got FTT token. That's down 13.5%. Dogecoin down 13%. Arguably, those are the most speculative, some of the most speculative tokens at least on this list. And you can see that they are underperforming by a wide margin.\n\nI noticed that coming into the year that was a similar state of affairs, that was before the Bitcoin rally took off. So is this an indication of Bitcoin FOMO or fear aversion? I'm a little bit leaning to the left there-- or to the latter there. I think it's a little bit of a disconcertion in the market right now, especially given some of the macro data that we're in or that we've gotten, especially that hotter than expected payrolls report this morning. So we'll have to see if this continues, but pay close attention to the ratio of Bitcoin to Ethereum here, guys.\n\nStory continues\n\nMADISON MILLS: All right, Jared. Thank you so much. We're just complimenting your sneakers over in the studio.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Oh, thank you.\n\nMADISON MILLS: So hopefully we can get a little bit of--\n\nSEANA SMITH: Look good on this Friday.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Can we pan down?\n\nMADISON MILLS: I know. We got to pan down to get the Nike's. Thank you so much, Jared. Really appreciate it as always."
