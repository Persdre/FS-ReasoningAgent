        "title": "Bitcoin primed to outpace Ethereum during bull market for first time next cycle - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Quick Take\n\nThe year 2023 has marked a shift in the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Despite Ethereum\u2019s substantial dollar value growth of 88%, it has significantly underperformed compared to Bitcoin, being down by 25% against the lead digital asset. The ratio currently sits at a precarious 0.053, teetering near year-to-date lows.\n\nThis trend invites speculation as to whether the crypto landscape may soon witness a further dip in Ethereum\u2019s performance. The BTC-ETH Dominance metric, an oscillator that tracks the macro outperformance trends between Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides some relevant insights. It gauges the Bitcoin Market Cap\u2019s dominance over the combined market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum, normalized around a long-term mean using a 0.765 factor.\n\nHigher values and uptrends point towards Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum, while lower values and downtrends signal Ethereum\u2019s superior performance. Currently, we are technically in an era of Ethereum dominance, with the metric at -0.016, which is the lowest level since Ethereum dominance began in May 2021. Traditionally, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during bull markets, raising the question: Could this be the first bull market where Bitcoin outpaces Ethereum?"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin's surge may be getting the headlines, but a number of altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also experiencing big gains.\n\nDogecoin, the biggest meme coin in existence and the 10th largest digital asset by market cap, was last week's biggest gainer and is still gaining today: over the past 24 hours, it's closing in on a 5% gain and is trading hands for $0.08.\n\nMeme coin Shiba Inu has also seen sizable gains, having risen nearly 6% in the past day. The Dogecoin competitor and meme coin is the 19th biggest cryptocurrency by market and is right now trading for $0.00000888.\n\nMeme coins\u2014volatile cryptocurrencies based on Internet memes\u2014last week got a boost after a number of new tokens sprung into existence following the deaths of legendary investor Charlie Munger and divisive diplomat Henry Kissinger. But the meme coins have already seen their moment pass. MUNGER has done less than $1,000 in volume in the past 24 hours and the Kissinger token has seen none of the tokens change hand at all since yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, the second biggest digital currency by market cap, is also up, having gained more than 2% in the past day. It is currently priced at $2,208 per coin.\n\nAll eyes are on Bitcoin, though, which has continued to hit highs not seen since the biggest coin in existence crashed in May 2022.\n\nRenewed interest has flooded the market as investors are optimistic that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product after 10 years.\n\nThe asset has surged by over 12% in the past week but is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044; it is currently priced at $41,256 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin spin-off Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been one of the best performers of the top 20.

        "content": "BTC crossed $42,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid rising market optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF would receive approval.\n\nBitcoin and ether once rose and fell in near lockstep, but no more.\n\nThough the prices of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value have both climbed in 2023, they have taken somewhat different paths, with BTC skyrocketing 145% year-to-date and ether jumping a still strong but lesser 85%.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin cracked the $42,000 threshold for the first time since early April 2022 when the Terra ecosystem started to collapse, while ether rose above $2,200 for the first time since May 2022, according to Coinmarketcap data. BTC was recently trading at about $41,950, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nRead more: 12 Charts That Tell the Story of Crypto in 2023\n\nIn its newsletter on Monday, Kaiko Research, which tracks crypto market data, attributed the gap in no small part to rising optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve applications for long elusive spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nKaiko noted that BTC volatility has declined significantly since the summer not long after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and other financial powerhouses submitted their spot bitcoin ETF applications. The firm used the Sharpe Ratio, a measure of compensation that investors receive for taking on more risk where a higher ratio equals a better risk-adjusted return. BTC outperformed most traditional assets, including gold, and Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $4.6 Billion First Day Trading Volume\n\n\u201cThe difference in risk-adjusted returns can largely be chalked up to BTC\u2019s superior price performance this year. The ratio was about 0.072 at the start of the year and is now 0.053,\u201d Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey told Unchained in an email. \u201cETH has likely had a softer rally because the main catalyst/narrative \u2013 a potential spot BTC ETF \u2013 directly relates to BTC.\u201d\n\nBitcoin, which has a market capitalization of $812 billion compared to the $267 billion for Ethereum, is often hailed as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. As a result, bitcoin\u2019s price has tended to be more sensitive to global economic factors and policy changes such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments last week that another interest rate hike wasn\u2019t currently in discussion \u2013 a favorable sign for the asset.\n\nSpot ETF Applications Favor BTC\n\nThirteen companies have filed spot bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale, which hopes to turn its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The SEC\u2019s thinking on the Grayscale situation remains unclear and could delay that potential product\u2019s approval, although in an interview with Unchained, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart reiterated his belief that he expects the SEC to approve the applications en masse between Jan. 8 and 10.\n\nThe SEC is currently considering seven applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. While a BlackRock application last month caused ETH to have a stronger rally than BTC, there\u2019s general sentiment that bitcoin has an easier road to approval. This is partly because bitcoin is older, has a larger market capitalization and has a more straightforward use case. Ethereum, in contrast, is a more complex platform for decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nOn Monday, BlackRock and Bitwise filed amendments to their applications, a further indication of progress, Seyffart wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, another measure of crypto market optimism continued to point upward as inflows to digital asset investment products rose for a 10th consecutive week, according to research group CoinShares. The rise underscores institutional investors\u2019 interest in the asset.\n\nCoinShares data showed that bitcoin had $133 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $1.68 billion. But the group also found that Ethereum had just $31 million of inflows over the same period, bringing its net flows into the positive for the first time this year.\n\nIn an email to Unchained, Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, echoed Carey\u2019s comments. \u201cBitcoin has outperformed Ethereum in large part because many are anticipating that these spot BTC ETFs will likely get approved fairly soon,\u201d Levin wrote. \u201cAn ETH ETF might also be on the horizon, though it\u2019s less definitive than the Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of capital getting allocated to Bitcoin and this, in turn, is having an outsize impact on momentum.\u201d"

        "title": "Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Hit $28K Following BlackRock ETF Approval as BTC ETF Token Presale Passes $2M - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum will skyrocket in price should BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF gain the SEC\u2019s approval, according to analysts. This will result in more than 10x growth based on its current price.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF Token presale recently hit $2m as analysts provide 10-100x price predictions.\n\nUnprecedented Institutional Captial Anticipated as Key Price Driver\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a notable spike in November when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled down on its crypto efforts, filing for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be listed on Nasdaq, opening the door to a broad new audience previously deterred from buying ETH for technical, security, or liquidity reasons.\n\nThis would propel cryptocurrency to a legitimate investment opportunity, even for traditional investors. As such, it is no surprise that Ethereum\u2019s price is rising in anticipation, currently at $2.09K, up 15% in the last month.\n\nYet, some analysts are significantly bullish on where Ethereum could be headed in the upcoming market cycle.\n\nIn a breakdown on TheStreet, prominent analyst Austin Arnold said, \u201cThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, is now backing both Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d suggesting this is of monumental importance for the assets\u2019 future.\n\nHe then considered BlackRock\u2019s assets under management (AUM), how much it may allocate to the ETH ETF, and how this could impact the asset\u2019s market cap.\n\nArnold then discussed a bull case following the ETF approval, contemplating Ethereum could climb to highs of $41,000. However, he stated, \u201cI do not see Ethereum getting that far.\u201d\n\nInstead, the analyst sees a more realistic prediction being $28,000, or $10,000.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s $28,000, $45,000, $10,000, I\u2019d be happy with anything, but I\u2019m a long-term holder,\u201d Arnold concluded.\n\nOne of the factors that he highlighted was the difference in Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s structure, tokenomics, and utility. He explained, \u201cOne\u2019s digital gold, it\u2019s aiming to be a store of value. While Ethereum is like digital oil, used to power a global, decentralized supercomputer, build apps. Just like a car needs gasoline to be able to run, Ethereum is the gas that makes the system work.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also referenced Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism, which makes the token deflationary by destroying a small part of each transaction fee. Coupled with the incoming ETF liquidity inflows, Arnold believes this could significantly bolster its price.\n\nHowever, he understands there is a ceiling to how far it can go in the next market cycle. \u201c$10,000 ETH is the most realistic scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nThis represents less than a 5x gain from its current price. While this is a significant return for those with large portfolios, it is unlikely to render sufficient returns for those with limited financial resources.\n\nOne alternative with a lot of upside potential is Bitcoin ETF Token, a new trending presale that has raised over $2.1 million in three weeks amid the BlackRock hype.\n\nStake-to-Earn Bitcoin ETF Token ICO Hits $2M Milestone\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is a compelling new project that rewards holders in line with key Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nThe project has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned as Bitcoin ETFs reach five main targets, creating a sense of scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) when the hype is highest.\n\nIt also features a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each milestone. This incentivizes people to hold longer and ensures explosive price action following the project\u2019s IEO.\n\nThese factors make Bitcoin ETF Token deflationary, introducing the scarcity principle into the project, which has been a key driver for Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic price action since its launch in 2009.\n\nAnother exciting factor is its staking mechanism, rewarding its community and incentivizing users to lock up their tokens, further limiting the available supply.\n\nHolders can garner a 118% staking APY, but they must be quick because this decreases as more users stake their tokens.\n\nThe project has experienced significant success lately, with top analysts providing massively bullish predictions. Jacob Bury speculates it will 10x after its launch, while Crypto Boy believes it could 100x.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.
