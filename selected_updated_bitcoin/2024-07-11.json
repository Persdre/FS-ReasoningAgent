        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has just been freed from an aggressive sell-off by a top whale, spotted about a week ago. According to data from crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, the Ethereum whale, identified as the open-source decentralized computing platform the Golem Project, just staked 40,000 ETH. This staked fund is worth $124.6 million as of the time of staking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum freedom after intense Sell-off\n\nPer previously referenced posts by Lookonchain, the Golem Project started sending thousands of ETH to centralized exchanges on July 8. In the first wave of the sell-off, the protocol sent 24,400 ETH worth approximately $72 million to Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex.\n\nGolem Project was one of the foundational beneficiaries of Ethereum ICO as far back as 2016. At the time, the protocol raised 820,000 ETH when the price of the coin traded for just $10.2.\n\nWith the sell-off activated, this week, the outfit also moved another 4,600 ETH, valued at $14.1 million, to Binance and Bitfinex, as of July 9. On July 10, another 3,000 ETH deposit was made to Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase.\n\nThe staked Ethereum was also moved on July 10, and while many feared further selling off, the Golem Project decided to lock up the funds for now.\n\nPerfect timing\n\nEthereum is the second major cryptocurrency responsible for the broader market sell-off at the moment. While the spot Ethereum ETF sentiment is expected to sustain sentiment and price growth, the reversal is the case.\n\nIn the early stages, investors looked to the ETF as a major catalyst to drive growth and, hence, went all out to buy the coin. With Bitcoin losing its position in the industry, the ripple effect on Ethereum saw many HODLers offloading their bags.\n\nKnowing its sell-offs might trigger a market slump, the Golem Project decided to sell its bag at a time when the impact would be least felt."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Inflows Could Hit $10B, Sending Ether to New ATH - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Ethereum ETF inflows could spark a new all-time high for the asset upon the launch of the ETFs, according to analysts. The recently approved Spot Ethereum ETFs are earning a lot of attention before their launch, with experts predicting how high they will send the Ether asset. Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini recently predicted that the ETFs can expect to see $5 billion in net inflows over its first 6 months. However, new analysis suggests that that number may double.\n\nTom Dunleavy, a managing partner at crypto investment firm MV Global, believes that the Ethereum ETF inflows could soar beyond $10 billion. \u201cWe saw $15 billion in flows for Bitcoin. I think we\u2019re probably going to see $5 billion to $10 billion for Ethereum,\u201d Dunleavy said speaking to CoinTelegraph. \u201cI expect a very positive price impact sending us to new all-time highs by early Q4.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Golem Network\u2019s ETH Sale: A Strategic Ecosystem Move\n\nHow Will Ethereum Fare Once ETFs Launch?\n\nImage Source: WatcherGuru\n\nCurrently, nearly a dozen Ethereum ETF filings are awaiting final approval before the asset can launch on the market. Following the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the assets exploded in the first few weeks, catapulting BTC to an all-time high in March. Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to do the same for Ether, which is currently the second-highest-performing crypto asset by market cap. Ether currently trades at $3,136.48, and its all-time high was $4,721.07 in May 2021.\n\nDunleavy said he expects ETH ETFs to attract around $1 billion per month as a \u201cbase case\u201d for the next few months. Since the asset is \u201cless available on exchanges\u201d according to the MV Global representative, it may see more hype and demand, thrusting the currency to new highs quickly.\n\nAlso Read: Can Ethereum [ETH] Hit $3,500 This Weekend?\n\nThe last 24 hours have seen Ether increase almost 2%. Currently trading above $3,100, there are still investors disappointed in the asset\u2019s performance. However, the long-term outlook for Ethereum post-ETF launch is extremely bullish. Just last week, VanEck, Fidelity, and other Spot Ethereum ETF issuers filed amended S-1 forms with the SEC. That brought the product one step closer to launch. Moreover, experts are now predicting the investment vehicle will begin trading within the next two weeks.\n\nIf this launch date prediction rings true, Ether could explode in price by the end of 2024 as Tom Dunleavy suggests. The ETF asset is likely going to mimic the performance of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Therefore, expect a frenzy around Ethereum post-ETF launch, and watch out for a huge surge in inflows during the opening days of the ETF\u2019s arrival."
