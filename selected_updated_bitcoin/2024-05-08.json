        "content": "Solana Gains 5%, While Bitcoin and Ethereum Experience Minor Dips\n\nWhile most of the top cryptocurrencies are trading sideways or slightly down, Solana (SOL) stands out with a nearly 2.28% increase over the past day. According to CoinMarketCap data, Solana is currently trading at $155.03, marking a week-long gain of over 20.36%. Despite a turbulent month that saw its value swing from a high of $184 to a low of nearly $120, Solana has been steadily climbing in the past week, outpacing the gains of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin remained flat over the past 24 hours, trading at $63,618, while Ethereum has dipped slightly by 0.84% to $3,075. Over the past week, Bitcoin has seen a modest increase of 4.05%, while Ethereum is up 2.20%.\n\nAmong the top 100 coins by market capitalization, a couple of notable gainers are in the Solana ecosystem. Jupiter's token, JUP, which serves as a decentralized exchange aggregator, has risen 25% over the past week to reach a price of $1.14. Additionally, leading Solana-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced an over 35% increase over the past 7 days, reaching $3.28.\n\nSolana's recent resurgence coincides with a surge in new tokens deployed on the network using the SPL standard. On Saturday alone, a record-breaking 14,648 new tokens were deployed on Solana, as reported by Solscan.

        "content": "Grayscale Investments has withdrawn its application to provide an Ethereum futures ETF.\n\nMichael Sonneshein, Grayscale\u2019s CEO, said he is optimistic that the SEC will approve the firm\u2019s application to convert its Ethereum trust to a spot ETF\n\nGrayscale Investments will focus on converting its Ethereum trust \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 to spot exchange-traded products, CEO Michael Sonnenshein said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAt Grayscale we decided to focus our energy on our spot products. That\u2019s really core to our DNA,\u201d he said during an event in London that was hosted by the Financial Times.\n\nOn Tuesday, media reported that the crypto-native asset manager had withdrawn its application to the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide an Ether futures ETF.\n\nIt had filed the application in October.\n\nSonnenshein said the asset manager was withdrawing the application because a number of futures products are already available for investors.\n\nAs DL News has reported, VanEck\u2019s EFUT and ProShares\u2019 EETH dominate the brutally competitive Ethereum ETF field, accounting for over 90% of total trading volume at launch.\n\n\u201cSometimes we will file for a product. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to come to market,\u201d Sonnenshein said\n\nAll eyes on Ether ETFs\n\nGrayscale paved the way for the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by winning a legal case against the SEC that allowed it to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe SEC granted Grayscale\u2019s application \u2014 plus 10 others from various asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments \u2014 in January\n\nSince the wild success of these funds, which have seen almost $12 billion in net inflows, attention has turned to the approval of spot Ethereum products.\n\nGrayscale, along with BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest, Fidelity, Invesco, and Hashdex, has applied to convert its Ethereum trust to a spot ETF.\n\nThe industry will know what the SEC is thinking when the regulator makes a decision on the first application, VanEck\u2019s, on May 23.\n\nMini Trust\n\nGrayscale has also filed to provide a mini trust \u2014 a smaller fund seeded with assets from the larger trust.\n\nCraig Salm, chief legal officer at Grayscale, has said the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust aims to complement the rest of the firm\u2019s Ethereum-based line of products to support a range of investors.\n\nThe mini trust \u201cwould launch as a lower-fee alternative spot Ethereum ETF and is designed for investors interested in optimising their Ethereum ETF investment for a \u2018buy-and-hold\u2019 strategy in their brokerage or retirement account, for example,\u201d Salm said.\n\nAnalysts aren\u2019t bullish on the chances of the SEC approving any of the applications for spot Ether products.\n\nFor one, Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status isn\u2019t clearly defined. SEC chair Gary Gensler has been evasive about whether Ethereum is a security.\n\nPlus, Gensler suffered political blowback from anti-crypto politicians in the Biden administration after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 though, arguably, the agency had no choice after it lost in court to Grayscale.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sonnenshein said while it was difficult to know what the SEC is thinking on Ethereum, Grayscale is \u201coptimistic that the SEC will do the right thing by investors.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cGrayscale Ethereum Trust is already an SEC reporting company. We file 10-Ks and 10-Qs [disclosures to the SEC], and we\u2019ve always been a business that pushes our regulators to allow crypto to be brought further and further into the regulatory perimeter.\u201d\n\nReach out to the author at joanna@dlnews.com."
