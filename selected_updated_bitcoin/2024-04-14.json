        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptos bleed as tension escalates in the Middle East - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market registered a massive loss after Iran officially launched an attack against Israel\n\nThe biggest loss bearers of this event among the top 20 coins were SHIB, AVAX, and XRP, with over 10% loss in the past hour.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has registered a massive reaction to the escalating tensions in the Middle East. Bitcoin (BTC), the king coin, has lost nearly 8% of its value within a few minutes, while other cryptocurrencies have registered a loss exceeding that. The great crypto plunge follows news of Iran\u2019s official attack on Israel, confirmed by Israeli authorities.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, at press time, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $62,049 with a market cap of over $1 trillion. The coin has registered a downtrend of 7.51% in the past hour, while its past-day trend shows a similar pattern.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, has also lost a huge portion of its value in the past hour. According to CMC, ETH lost nearly 9% of its value, with the coin trading at $2924 at press time. The market cap for ETH stood at over $353 billion, while the trade volume was at over $41 billion.\n\nNotably, the three biggest losers among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the past hour were Shiba Inu (SHIB) with nearly 13. 01%, XRP with a drop of 13.89%, and Avalanche (AVAX) with 12.46 % drop.\n\nBitcoin bears the brunt of escalating situations in the Middle East\n\nThe price of the crypto market plunged collectively after reports confirmed that Iran has launched a direct attack against Israel. This move comes across as a significant one as it is the first time the Iranian regime has launched an attack directly against Israel from its soil.\n\nIran has launched dozens of drones at Israel and the target of the attack remains unclear. The move comes as a response against Israel for IDF\u2019s attack on the country\u2019s consular annex in Damascus. Along with the market\u2019s response, the attack has led to the closure of Israeli airspace and planes have been diverted from any Israeli destination."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights Bitcoin against the USD has been displaying weakness and hence the altcoins have also jumped into the beamish well\n\nTop tokens like Ethereum and Cardano are displaying huge bearish signals as they have plunged before their respective key support levels\n\nThe market dynamics appear to have changed to a large extent as the prices of the majority of the cryptos have plunged below the crucial support as Bitcoin slumped hard to close to $60,000. During the previous pullback, many speculated a drop below the levels, but the token underwent a rebound from the levels similar to the previous day. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the market participants are no doubt bullish on Bitcoin but wish to accumulate below the lower support.\n\nWith this, the second-generation and third-generation cryptos, Ethereum & Cardano, have fallen weak and display a huge possibility of reaching the lower support zone, this summer. A popular analyst, Benjamin Cowen, believes the ongoing pullback is quite natural in the BTC price rally, but has also mentioned its reverse impact over the other top altcoins as well. For instance, the ETH price, which has slumped below $3000, holds a huge possibility of witnessing another pullback before initiating a rebound.\n\nConsidering the above chart, the analyst says that the ETH/BTC has been closely following the previous trend. According to this, the pair had a bottom just after the first rate cut after breaking the support. Therefore, a similar rally can be expected at present wherein the pair could find its bottom somewhere below 0.035 BTC.\n\nOn the other hand, the analyst shares a similar view on Cardano, as the ADA/BTC pair is closely following descending support.\n\nMuch like the ETH price rally, the ADA price is also following a previous trend as ADA/BTC is trading, sticking along the lower trend line. Therefore, the current trade setup suggests the pair could eventually bottom at 0.0000035 BTC, which may further trigger a massive bullish spell. However, the analyst believes both pairs may find their bottoms during the summer, beyond which a healthy rebound can be expected."

        "content": "Aligned Layer, a startup touted as a \u201cuniversal verification layer for Ethereum,\u201d confirmed Sunday, April 14, that it raised $2.6 million in seed funding.\n\nLemniscap, a seven-year-old firm that has backed multiple companies in the crypto blockchain space, led the effort. The firm previously led the $2.4-million funding round for web3 startup Safary in January.\n\nBankless Ventures and Paper Ventures are also backing Aligned Layer, along with StarkWare, O(1)Labs and Ingonyama CEO Omer Shlomovits.\n\nAligned Layer announced the capital raise via social media. See below.\n\n1. We're excited to announce that we've raised $2.6M in our Seed Round, led by @Lemniscap , to enable developers to access affordable and fast proof verification for all proof systems.\n\n\n\nAligned Layer helps Ethereum become a better, faster and cheaper settlement layer for validity\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pFCOFRAh8R \u2014 Aligned Layer (@alignedlayer) April 14, 2024\n\nAligned Layer is touted as the first decentralized ZK Proof verification layer for Ethereum. It\u2019s also powered by Eigen Layer \u2014 a restaking mechanism that allows ETH stakers to reallocate their staked ETH and Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to improve security for other protocols.\n\nYou might also like: Blockchain fraud group strikes again, launches fresh scheme on Blast network\n\nAligned Layer goals\n\nThe company will put the proceeds of the capital raise toward expanding its operations and accelerating Aligned Layer\u2019s mainnet launch, scheduled for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAs an infrastructure provider, Aligned Layer aims to lower costs and improve speeds for developers that are building applications like L2s, or layer-2 networks.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a testament to our team\u2019s shared dedication to making Ethereum the most cost-effective and efficient platform for ZK verification by using Eigen Layer,\u201d Aligned Layer co-founder Roberto Jos\u00e9 Catal\u00e1n said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe seed round also included participation from several angel investors, including Sreeram Kannan, Brandon Kase, Daniel Lubarov, DCbuilder, Chainyoda, Weikeng Chen, Sam Benyakoub, Lucas Kozinski and Peter Fittin (SizeChad). See below.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SizeChad/status/1779570022664245589\n\n\u201cAt Aligned Layer, we firmly believe that developers should be able to use the proof system that best suits their needs, without being constrained by the settlement layer,\u201d Catal\u00e1n added.\n\nThe funds are expected to give the company enough runway to execute near-term goals.\n\nThe Aligned Layer funding comes on the heels of a busy week for crypto venture capitalists. New York-based Monad Labs, for example, scored $225 million in funding as part of a round led by Paradigm. Monad is a layer-1 blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine but can process transactions using the same set of rules faster.\n\nThere was also Bitcoin layer-2 network Mezo. The startup raised $21 million in a Pantera-led funding round.\n\nDuring the first three months of 2024, global investors put $2.5 billion into crypto-related startups, according to PitchBook.\n\nHowever, investors don\u2019t appear to be warming up to blockchain-related gaming companies. According to data from DappRadar, the sector secured $288 million in funding for the first quarter of 2024. That\u2019s a 57% decrease compared to the previous three-month period."
