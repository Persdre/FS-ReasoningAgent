        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol has exploded in price amid a recent spike in whale activity and new addresses, according to the crypto analytics firm Santiment.\n\nYFI, the native asset of automated yield-farming protocol Yearn.Finance, is trading at $10,242 at time of writing.\n\nSantiment notes that the number of YFI transactions valued at more than $100,000 recently surged to its highest level since July 2022. New address growth has also been \u201cexponentially increasing,\u201d according to the analytics firm.\n\nDespite its recent gains, YFI remains nearly 89% down from its all-time high of $90,786, which it hit in May 2021.\n\nSantiment also notes that Ethereum fees have risen back to their highest levels in four months.\n\nIn terms of the overall crypto market, Santiment says digital asset traders still have a bullish bias, which has historically made markets more likely to flatten or fade.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets have flattened the past three days, but traders are still showing signs of optimism and FOMO. Historically, price rises are most likely to occur after the crowd becomes fearful and keywords like sell, top, or scam rise on social media.\u201d\n\nThe 129th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 71% in the past seven days.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday announced that it will \u201cdesignate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change\u201d for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures Trust.\n\nThe filing pushes the deadline to Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nIn the filing, the SEC said that the \u201cCommission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d Essentially, the regulatory agency has another window to push back a decision.\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart posted on X that the delay of the 19b-4 filing was not \u201cremotely surprising.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nGrayscale filed in early October to convert its Ethereum Trust into an ETF.\n\n\u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the US regulatory perimeter,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn August, Grayscale scored a court win against the SEC after it sought to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nThe judges didn\u2019t order the SEC to give Grayscale\u2019s proposal a greenlight, but rather ordered the regulatory body to re-examine the application it originally denied.\n\nThe panel of judges agreed that the original denial, but the allowance of bitcoin futures ETFs was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAlongside spot bitcoin ETFs, firms are now vying to get spot ether ETFs off the ground. Ark Invest and 21Shares plan to introduce five funds holding both bitcoin futures and ether futures this week. Both filed for the products back in August.\n\nIn early October, six ETFs holding ether futures launched, with roughly $20 million or so in combined assets under management as of early November.\n\nAdditionally, ETF watchers are keeping a close eye on the SEC\u2019s approach to the spot bitcoin ETFs after big traditional finance firms such as BlackRock threw their hats in the ring.\n\nThe SEC also postponed decisions on the big ETFs in late September ahead of a potential government shutdown.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

FTX and its now-fallen leader Sam Bankman-Fried were widely credited with providing substantial money and resources behind the Solana project to get it off the ground.\n\nSolana is up about 550% this year and has been one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2023.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could climb 7%, recouping the ground covered since the November 9 rejection from the $37,972 range high.\n\nEthereum price defends the $1,935 support level at all costs, with success likely to initiate a 10% rally to $2,200.\n\nRipple price shows weakness, breaks the triangle to the south as the 25-day EMA provides support at $0.6183.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing strength again after a stark correction on Tuesday that bruised the market. Ethereum (ETH) is following the trend set by the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, the same cannot be said for Ripple (XRP), at least not yet, as the remittance token's price is showing weakness.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price drops, $90 million in open interest wiped out amid jitter over spot BTC ETF window closing\n\nBitcoin price pulls north as momentum restores\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pulling north, trying to recover all the ground lost in the recent crash that saw up to $90 million in open interest wiped out of the market. With the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) coming into play at $34,572, BTC is trying to reclaim territory above the critical resistance at $36,788.\n\nFor a confirmed move north, investors should watch for Bitcoin price to break and close above the $36,788 level. This will set the tone for BTC to target the $37,972 range high before reaching the $38,000 psychological level.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend its reach to tag the $40,000 psychological level, with such a move constituting a 10% climb above current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is tipping north, suggesting momentum is rising, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) holds in positive territory. This adds credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, another rejection from the $36,788 resistance level could see Bitcoin price losing support due to the 25-day and 50-day EMAs at $34,572 and $32,456, respectively, before dipping into the supply zone turned bullish breaker where it could test the 100-day EMA at $30,528.\n\nAlso Read: Over $1 billion worth of BTC susceptible to be sold as Bitcoin price hints at short-term correction\n\nEthereum price holds above $1,935\n\nEthereum (ETH) price maintains above the $1,935 level, a crucial support that could spell doom for ETH if lost. With the RSI tipping north and the AO holding in the positive zone, ETH could scale north, restoring itself above the $2,029 support in order to ride the ascending trendline. This could ship the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to the $2,136 range high.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if selling pressure increases, Ethereum price could slip below the $1,935 support. A decisive move below this level would confirm the downtrend, with ETH likely to test the 25-day or 50-day EMA at $1,892 and $1,806, respectively.\n\nIn a worse case, Ethereum price could tag the 100-day EMA at $1,763, with a break and close below it invalidating the bullish thesis under the $1,753 support level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: Eighteen-months ascending triangle pattern appraises $4,000 target for ETH\n\nRipple price breaks the triangle\n\nRipple (XRP) price has shown weakness, breaking out of the triangle to the downside amid reducing volatility. Increased selling pressure could send XRP below the 25-day EMA at $0.6181. A break and close below the $0.5981 would lower optimism for a move north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if buyer momentum increases, Ripple price could restore back above the lower trendline of the triangle above $0.6584, which would set the tone for a move to $0.7000.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend toward the Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.7519 to $0.7623, with Ripple price filling the inefficiency and restoring balance.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"
