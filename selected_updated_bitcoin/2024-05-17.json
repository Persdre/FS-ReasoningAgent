        "title": "Ethereum ETF Approval Coming Sooner Rather Than Later, Says Coinbase - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) could hit the market sooner than expected, says Coinbase, despite growing industry observer pessimism.\n\nIn a note this week, America\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange said that \u201cwhile there is uncertainty around a timely approval given the SEC\u2019s apparent silence with issuers,\u201d it\u2019s only a matter of time before such a product hits the market.\n\nThere\u2019s a long list of top asset managers\u2014including VanEck, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton\u2014who have filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to release an Ethereum ETF.\n\nSuch a product would give investors exposure to ETH, the second biggest digital coin by market cap, via shares that trade on a stock exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Wall Street\u2019s biggest regulator has been slow to give a response to applicants, and has pushed back decision deadlines, echoing its earlier approach to spot Bitcoin ETF approvals before finally pulling the trigger in January.\n\nThis is usually normal in the ETF application process, but the SEC\u2019s reluctance to talk about the investment vehicles has led analysts from the likes of Bloomberg and CoinShares to say that such crypto funds would not get the green light by the May deadline.\n\n\u201cAs crypto begins to take form as an election issue, it\u2019s also less certain in our view that the SEC would be willing to front the political capital necessary to support a denial,\u201d wrote David Han, institutional research analyst at Coinbase.\n\n\u201cEven if the first deadline on May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection,\u201d he added, \u201cwe think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, crypto fund manager Grayscale won an appeal against the SEC to convert its Bitcoin fund into a spot ETF in a high-profile case.\n\nThe SEC then reluctantly said yes to 11 Bitcoin ETFs on January 10. The investment products have since been massively successful, taking in billions of dollars of inflows.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAfter one very long ride, Ethereum (ETH) has finally breached the psychologically important $3,000 price mark. While this calls for celebration, investors are advised to exercise caution as headwinds lie ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum market headwind not cleared\n\nDespite its strong correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s price outlook in this current bull cycle has been somewhat disappointing. While Bitcoin soared to its all-time high (ATH) and set a new one above $73,000, Ethereum traded above 40% below its ATH.\n\nThe $3,000 price level has been a major bane for Ethereum over the past month. From at least April 17, Ethereum has made at least six attempts to surpass the $3,000 resistance but was always rejected at each point.\n\nAt the time of writing, the coin is changing hands for $3,051.63; however, it is down by 1.27% in the past 24 hours.\n\nFrom a low of $2,925.09, Ethereum outwitted the bears to attain its current level, a point that might not hold now. The general market optimism surrounding Ethereum is bearish, with the trading volume down 11.92% to $13,653,971,007.\n\nOn thin ice\n\nEthereum is passing through a major litmus test that might either make or mar its valuation moving forward. While it remains unclear what triggered the shoot-up in the price, the drawdown is explainable.\n\nThis is because the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to designate Ethereum as a security. This is projected as the basis for which the regulator might deny several applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe industry is currently divided on the likely disposition of the U.S. SEC regarding this offering; however, experts\u2019 general consensus is that the approval odds are reasonably down. If the SEC says no to an Ethereum ETF, it might trigger a ripple effect in a price slump overall."

Major players include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, UBS, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada, and hedge funds like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors.\n\nMillennium Management leads the pack with $1.9 billion invested across various Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).
