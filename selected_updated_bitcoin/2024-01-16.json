        "content": "Over 200 wallets have lost funds after interacting with crypto bridge aggregator Bungee.\n\nThose who previously sent tokens via the bridge's Socket protocol route on Ethereum were affected.\n\nA bug in the underlying technology that powers parts of crypto bridge aggregator Bungee has just cost its users a combined $3.3 million.\n\nAt approximately 8:11 pm London time on Tuesday, over 200 wallets that had previously used Bungee\u2019s Socket route to send tokens on Ethereum began to see their funds drained from them.\n\nTayler Melvin, team hospitality lead at Socket, said in the Socket Discord server the project had \u201cexperienced a security incident which affected wallets with infinite approvals to Socket contracts.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of the stolen tokens \u2014 over $2.9 million \u2014 were converted into Ether. Smaller amounts of Polygon\u2019s Matic token, wrapped versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and MakerDAO\u2019s Dai stablecoin remain in the hacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nAfter noticing the attack, Socket, the project that manages the Bungee bridge\u2019s underlying technology, paused the smart contract that was being exploited.\n\n\u201cWhomever responsible can no longer do any further damage, we\u2019ve paused everything,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nSocket is an interoperability protocol that allows data and asset transfers across chains. Bungee is a bridge aggregator built using Socket\u2019s technology by the same team.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a long list of bridge hacks that have plagued DeFi in recent years.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPrevious approvals\n\nPseudonymous security researcher officercia told DL News that the bug had inadvertently been deployed by Socket three days prior in a new smart contract.\n\nIt allowed the hacker to target those who had previously used the Bungee bridge to send tokens from Ethereum to other blockchains.\n\nWhen bridging tokens, users often have to first sign a separate transaction allowing the bridge to spend their funds.\n\nIn the case of Socket, as well as many other DeFi protocols, this approval is often set to allow the protocol requesting it to spend a much higher amount of tokens than required for the bridging transaction.\n\nThe hacker was able to exploit these approvals to drain tokens from victims\u2019 wallets without them having to sign another transaction.\n\n\u201cThis is a good time to start a new habit \u2014 revoke approvals afterwards,\u201d officercia said.\n\nTransactions that let a DeFi protocol spend a user\u2019s funds can be revoked using websites such as revoke.cash.\n\nIf those who had granted Socket the ability to spend their funds had revoked the permissions after bridging, they would have prevented the hacker from stealing their crypto.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.\n\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nEthereum's correction is temporary\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\n\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nBitcoin's dominance not going anywhere\n\nAfter a brief breach below the 50-day EMA \u2014 a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment \u2014 Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\n\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\n\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet."
