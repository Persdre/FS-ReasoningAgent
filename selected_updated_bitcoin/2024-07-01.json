        "content": "Crypto pundits are changing their bets on when Ethereum ETFs will launch.\n\nSo when can ETFs start to trade?\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts say.\n\nThe crypto industry\u2019s hopes that spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds will launch as early as this week are fading.\n\nIndustry watchers are not so certain that the Securities and Exchange Commission will green light the batch of applications this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to push back our over/under till after the holiday,\u201d Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said on X.\n\nHe previously said that he expected the market watchdog to give a thumbs up before July 4.\n\nBalchunas changed his mind after he\u2019d heard that the regulator had asked prospective issuers to amend their applications. He now says the week of July 8 is more likely.\n\nBalchunas said he expected little movement among regulators this week ahead of Independence Day.\n\nThis is a minor setback for an industry hoping the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs would catapult the stagnant market, similarly to how spot Bitcoin ETFs did at the start of the year.\n\nEthereum exchange-traded products will attract $15 billion in net flows in their first 18 months on the market, Bitwise\u2019s Matt Hougan recently said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOn crypto betting site Polymarket, punters put the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF to start trading by July 4 at 4%, down from 77% last week.\n\nThe SEC asked prospective issuers to address some comments in their applications and resend applications by July 8, an applicant insider told The Block on June 29.\n\nThe source noted to the news site that they expect more rounds of back and forth between applicants and the SEC.\n\nDespite the setback, Ethereum surged 3% over the weekend and is trading at $3,450.\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a whale from the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO) era has reemerged after more than six months of inactivity.\n\nA wallet that participated in Ethereum's ICO in 2015 and acquired 254,900 ETH at an ICO price of $0.311 per token transferred 7,000 ETH, equivalent to $24.28 million, to the Kraken exchange today.\n\nThis transaction marks the end of a 209-day silence from this notable holder, who still retains a substantial 40,000 ETH valued at approximately $139.5 million.\n\nThis whale's movements have caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community\u2014not only due to the sheer size of the holdings but also because of the potential market implications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLarge transactions by such early adopters can influence market sentiment and price dynamics, especially when the transfer is to a significant exchange like Kraken. It\u2019s often (but not always) the case that someone transfers to an exchange because they\u2019re selling or preparing for further trading activity.\n\nSimultaneously, another significant transaction involving the U.S. government surfaced.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, one of the known U.S. government wallets transferred 3,375 ETH, worth about $11.75 million, to an unknown address, 0x5a...1871, earlier today.\n\nThis address is known to hold the seized funds of Estonian crypto entrepreneurs Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin, who were involved in a high-profile cryptocurrency fraud case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe transfer of such a considerable amount of ETH by a government-held address raises intriguing questions about the potential uses of these funds.\n\nThis move follows a previous transaction where another U.S. government address transferred 11.84 BTC to address 3KHnTq...muuso9, indicating a pattern of strategic fund management or liquidation by authorities.\n\nThe timing of this transfer has sparked speculation within the crypto community.\n\nSome analysts suggest it could be a sign of profit-taking, while others view it as a potential redistribution of assets or liquidity provision to the market.\n\nAs both private whales and government entities maneuver large sums of digital assets, the potential impacts on market liquidity, price stability, and overall sentiment are significant.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "title": "Breaking: US Govt Moves $12M Ethereum, Is Bitcoin-Style Selloff Incoming? - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a notable move that has caught the attention of the crypto community, the U.S. government transferred a massive Ethereum (ETH) reserve on Monday, July 1. The transfer has sparked speculations around a potential ETH selloff, which could mirror the downtrend Bitcoin (BTC) suffered amid selloffs by German and U.S. governments. Moreover, the anticipated launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs this month further fuels such concerns.\n\nU.S. Government Shifts Ethereum Reserve\n\nAccording to Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government recently transferred 3,375 Ethereum. This reserve, valued at approximately $11.75 million, was shifted to an unidentified address on Monday. The transfer\u2019s timing is particularly significant as it comes ahead of anticipated approval of Spot Ether ETF S-1 filings.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) returned these filings to major applicants including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. Hence, analysts predict that applicants could submit further S-1 amendments this week. Meanwhile, they have offered a potential approval date for mid-July.\n\nThe movement of such a substantial amount of Ethereum before these key events has led to concerns that the U.S. government might be preparing to capitalize on the Ethereum ETF S-1 approval news. In case the government sells its Ethereum holdings, it could adversely influence the ETH price just like it did for Bitcoin.\n\nThe transferred funds are linked to the U.S. government\u2019s seized assets from Estonian crypto entrepreneurs Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin. Potapenko and Turogin were deceived investors through promises of high returns from their crypto mining operations. The fraudulent activities led to confiscation of significant crypto assets by authorities, including the Ethereum that was moved.\n\nThis Ethereum transfer follows a similar pattern observed last week when the U.S. government moved 4,000 Bitcoin to exchanges in June. The repeated movements of seized crypto assets have led to market speculation about imminent dumps, particularly in light of the upcoming Ethereum ETF decision.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. government holds 50.524K Ethereum worth a staggering $175.46 million. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price just recovered above $3,400 but the trend may be impacted by the latest transfer.\n\nAlso Read: ETH Price Surges 5% Amid Increased Whale Activity Ahead of Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nBitcoin Dump Concerns\n\nThe June BTC transfer by the U.S. government caused widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. In addition, on Friday, June 28, a notable transfer of 11.84 BTC was also recorded from the same government-held wallet.\n\nAs of yet, the U.S. government holds 213.534K Bitcoin, valued at a whopping $13.41 billion. With speculations of an impending selloff due to the BTC transaction last Friday, analysts have hinted at increased FUD in the market. Moreover, the German government\u2019s BTC selloffs have added to bearish sentiment in the market and among investors.\n\nIn the latest update, the German Government shifted 400 BTC to exchanges including Coinbase, Bitstamp and Kraken. The Bitcoin shifted is worth about $25.28 million. This again hints at an impending selloff by the German government just after the Bitcoin price rebounded above $63,000.\n\nMoreover, in last two weeks, the German Government-associated address has transferred over 2,700 BTC to crypto exchanges. Hence, market participants worry about a potential drop in the Bitcoin price. Moreover, the July rebound expectations are in jeopardy.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Network to Get Major Boost With SSF Roadmap, Says Vitalik Buterin\n\nKritika Mehta Kritika boasts over 2 years of experience in the financial news sector.
