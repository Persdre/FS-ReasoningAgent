        "content": "Ethereum whale jumps on \u2018buy the dip\u2019 opportunity after Israel's attack on Iran.\n\nThe buyback yield of Ethereum exceeds that of major S&P 500 firms.\n\nEthereum may continue trading inside key range as investors await the market's response to Bitcoin halving.\n\nEthereum resumed its sideways movement on Friday after briefly crashing due to Israel's attack on Iran. The move presented a buying opportunity for a whale, who quickly profited from it. This also comes when Ethereum's buyback yield exceeds that of several S&P 500 firms.\n\nRead more: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nDaily digest market movers: Israel's retaliation, whale activity, buyback yields, Hong Kong's ETH ETF\n\nEthereum wasn't left out, as the entire crypto market took a hit on Friday following Israel's strike in retaliation to Iran's attack on April 13. Here are your key market movers:\n\nAs ETH dipped briefly on Friday, a whale jumped on the opportunity, spending 9.5 million USDT to buy 3,253 ETH at ~$ $2,925, according to crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain. However, ETH's price has quickly recovered, especially as Iranian officials have downplayed responding to the attack. As a result, the whale made nearly $625,000 in unrealized profit.\n\n\n\nEthereum is outshining major tech and financial giants in terms of buyback yields, according to Token Terminal. In a list of $200 billion+ finance and tech S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway, Ethereum ranks number 16, above Tesla and JPMorgan with a buyback yield of 0.23%.\n\n\n\nBuyback for Ethereum, in this case, is implemented through token burns that began after The Merge in 2022. The number one smart contract blockchain achieved this feat in only nine years compared to the median age of 44 years of other companies in the list.\n\nETH buyback yield\n\nAlso read: Ethereum moves sideways as Q1 report indicates token burns are making it deflationary\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expressed doubts that Mainland China investors may not get access to Hong Kong's spot ETH ETFs when they start trading. This pessimism is based on China's ban on all crypto-related activities in 2021. However, other analysts have pointed to Hong Kong's positive reception to crypto investment as a good sign that spot ETH ETFs would see impressive inflows when they launch in the region.\n\n\n\nDespite ETH's brief price decline, ETH's long liquidations weren't heavy, sitting around $34.4 million in the past 24 hours. This may be due to heavy liquidations already seen earlier in the week.\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue trading inside key range\n\nETH attempted to break the $2,852 support on Friday after Israel attacked Iran. However, prices have quickly bounced back, and ETH appears to be continuing its consolidation. The calm may be due to investors exercising caution as they await how the market responds to Bitcoin's fourth halving, which is a few hours away.\n\nRead more: Ethereum declines as crypto market crash increases bearish sentiment\n\nConsidering that many analysts have predicted that Bitcoin halving is already priced in, ETH may experience light volatility in the next few hours.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nBut in the coming weeks, it won't go outside the range of $2,852 and $3,406 formed in recent price movements, except if major external factors prevail on its price. In the long term, ETH could test the resistance of $3,730. An unlikely approval of spot ETH ETFs by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) would send it past the $4,000 key level to a new all-time high."

It comes following the successful arrival of the fourth BTC halving, which has Bitcoiners and market enthusiasts euphoric.\n\nBITCOIN 'HALVING' CUTS IN HALF REWARDS PAID TO MINERS \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) April 20, 2024\n\nThe highly awaited Bitcoin halving finally happened on Saturday, with the Bitcoin block height hitting 840,000. In the aftermath, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 3.22% to $2.32 trillion. It comes as altcoins begin to reawaken, with most flashing green to outperform the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin halving concludes successfully as BTC miner rewards reduce to 3.125\n\nBitcoin price could drop to $60,000\n\nBitcoin price remains lull following the conclusion of the BTC halving, and in the \u2018sell the news\u2019 situation the big crypto risks a correction to $60,000 or lower. Notice the lower lows and lower highs on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), showing momentum is dropping.\n\nIn its place, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is edging toward negative territory as the red shade intensifies. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has slipped below the orange band of its signal line, suggesting a potential bearish cycle.\n\nBitcoin price could drop below $60,000 to test the $59,530 support or extend lower to the $50,420 threshold.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, a surge in buying pressure could send Bitcoin price further north. A decisive candlestick close above the $70,000 psychological level on the 3-day time frame would confirm the continuation of the uptrend. This could see BTC price reclaim its $73,777 peak, or higher to record a new all-time high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: When should BTC peak post-halving?\n\nEthereum price coils up for a breakout\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal technical formation that could see the largest altcoin rise. ETH is back above the $3,000 level and could record a bullish breakout as the market capitalization of altcoins seesaw against that of Bitcoin.\n\nThe RSI is tipping north, primed to recover above the 50 mean level. If it does, it could precipitate a strong move north for Ethereum price to extend higher.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit booking among the bears could see Ethereum price drop, with a slip below $2,850 support negating the bullish thesis. This could see the fall extend to the depths of $2,500.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum resumes consolidation after brief dip, buyback yield exceeds that of major S&P 500 companies\n\nRipple price shows strength\n\nRipple price could move up as it holds above the ascending trendline. The RSI seems primed for a pullback as it rejects further downside as it holds above 34. If XRP bulls are able to haul above 50, it could kick off a strong move north, sending Ripple price above the $0.5783.\n\nA decisive candlestick close above this level on the three-day timeframe would encourage more buy orders. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, bulls should watch for a candlestick close above $0.7630, the mean threshold of the supply zone between $0.7277 and $0.7959.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears pull XRP price below the ascending trendline, it could encourage a sell off to send the Ripple price to the $0.4183 support. In a dire case, the altcoin\u2019s price could drop all the way to the $0.3078 support.\n\nAlso Read: XRP fails to break past $0.50, posting 20% weekly losses"
