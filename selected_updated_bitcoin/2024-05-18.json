        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Jumps 5%, This Breakout Can Trigger Bull Run - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) is posing a strong recovery in the market jumping over 5% and shooting past $3,100 levels. After facing strong selling pressure for a few weeks, the ETH bulls are once again taking up the charge with the SEC decision on the spot Ethereum ETF approval just a week from now.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Breakout\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is currently trading around $3,087. It has recently broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe. If the price manages to close above this breakout level, we can anticipate a bullish momentum for Ethereum, as the falling wedge pattern is typically a bullish indicator.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, one must note that Ethereum has severely underperformed Bitcoin throughout this year in 2024 so far. The ETH/BTC price ratio reached a three-year low on Thursday at 0.044. Since the Merge, the correlation between BTC and ETH has decreased by 45%, diminishing the likelihood of \u201cthe flippening\u201d occurring in the near future.\n\nETH Can Suprise on the Upside\n\nWhile Ethereum has continued to stay under constant selling pressure, popular market analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that ETH could be gearing up for a strong surge on the upside. He wrote: \u201cComing weeks are going to be big for Ethereum and the whole ecosystem and markets are super negative\u201d.\n\nIn its latest research report published last Wednesday, crypto exchange Coinbase stated that Ethereum could surprise investors on the upside. Ether could potentially see an upside surprise in the coming months,\u201d the report stated, highlighting that the cryptocurrency lacks \u201csignificant supply-side pressures\u201d such as token unlocks or miner sales.\n\nFurthermore, Coinbase believes that one must not understate the importance of spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cWe believe the market may be underestimating the timing and likelihood of potential approval, leaving room for upside surprises,\u201d Coinbase stated.\n\n\u201cEven if the first deadline of May 23, 2024 encounters a rejection, we think there is a high likelihood that litigation could reverse that decision,\u201d the note said.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Sees End-of-Correction With This Resistance Breakout - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap entered a fresh rally in mid-week and rebounded from $2860 monthly support. This renewed buying interest bolstered by the Bitcoin price jump to $67000 on Friday has surged the ETH price to an 8.7% gain. However, an analysis of the daily chart shows the rising Ether price is heading to a crucial resistance indicating an upcoming pivot momentum for this asset.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Charts Might Turn Bullish Now: ETH Targets $4k?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Poised for Rebound as Falling Channel Pattern Nears Break\n\nIn the daily time frame chart, the Ethereum price shows the formation of a falling channel pattern. The two parallel trendlines acting as dynamic resistance and support have plunged the ETH value from $4084 to $2864 support indicating a nearly 30% loss.\n\nWhile the BTC price rally bolsters a new recovery sentiment in altcoin, the ETH price could remain trapped in a correction until the chart setup is intact.\n\nHaving said that, the Ether coin is heading higher to challenge the upper boundary of the Channel pattern. After a 3% upswing, the coin buyers escape the range of this pattern, signaling the end-of-correction trend.\n\nAccording to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in the middle of its bull cycle. Ju highlighted that Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is growing faster than its realized cap, a trend that historically lasts around two years.\n\nIf this pattern continues, the current bull cycle might extend until April 2025. The accompanying chart from CryptoQuant illustrates the growth rate difference between Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and realized cap, showing similar cycles approximately every two years.\n\nThis potential uptrend significantly influences the altcoin market bolstering top assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP to lead to higher rallies.\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the channel pattern will accelerate the buying momentum and assist buyers in rechallenging the $4080 high.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The dynamic resistance of the 50-day EMA prevents the ETH price from breaching the channel pattern.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The ADX slope falling below 18% hints the prevailing bearish momentum is weakening.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets. Armed with a strong grasp of technical analysis, he keeps a vigilant eye on the daily price movements of top assets and indices. Drawn by his fascination with financial instruments, Sahil enthusiastically embraced the emerging realm of cryptocurrency, where he continues to explore opportunities driven by his passion for trading\n\nDisclaimer: The presented content may include the personal opinion of the author and is subject to market condition.
