        "content": "The bridge connecting the HTX exchange (formerly Huobi) and Ethereum was exploited for approximately $87 million in crypto assets early Wednesday.\n\nLarge quantities of ether, tether (USDT) and a wrapped version of bitcoin (HBTC) were seen leaving the bridge for a previously unused Ethereum wallet.\n\nThe suspicious transactions were first analyzed by various blockchain security firms including CertiK, Peckshield and Cyvers.\n\nAccording to CertiK, the bridge\u2019s private key was likely compromised.\n\n\u201cThe suspicious transactions were initiated by the Huobi HECO Bridge operator wallet indicating that this wallet was compromised,\u201d a CertiK spokesperson told Blockworks.\n\nRead more: Crypto exchange HTX loses $8M in weekend hack\n\nVarious other ERC-20 tokens were drained, swapped for ether, and distributed to at least 8 other wallets.\n\nTwo hot wallets of HTX Global (formerly Huobi) lost funds, according to Cyvers. Board member Justin Sun confirmed the incident on X.\n\n\u201cHTX and Heco Cross-Chain Bridge Undergo Hacker Attack. HTX Will Fully Compensate for HTX\u2019s hot wallet Losses,\u201d Sun said.\n\nJustin Sun assumed control over the Huobi Eco Chain in October 2022, Bloomberg previously reported, although Sun denied he owns a majority stake. He referred to it as a merger with the Tron and BitTorrent Chain ecosystems, which he also controls.\n\nThe primary purpose of the HECO bridge is to enable the movement of digital assets between the Huobi Eco Chain and other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum.\n\nThe HECO hack is not an isolated incident but rather part of a pattern of security lapses in blockchain projects associated with Sun. Poloniex, an exchange acquired by Sun, suffered a $100 million exploit two weeks ago, which security analysts believe also may have resulted from compromised private keys.\n\nPoloniex officials have been in the process of negotiating with the hacker in that case.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if the two thefts are directly related.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Bitcoin price must hold above the critical support at $36,788 to keep hope for a continuation of the intermediate trend alive.\n\nThe $1,935 support level continues to hold for Ethereum price but the slump is likely to continue 5% lower.\n\nRipple price extends south, invalidating the bullish thesis with the potential for a further 8% slump to $0.5392.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains bearish, but there is hope, after the US Department of Justice may just have cleared the path for the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to some analysts, one of the stumbling blocks to the approval was the dominance of Binance exchange in the industry.\n\nLots of chatter on this Blackrock #Bitcoin ETF. And rightfully so. Blackrock more or less IS is the US government. They\u2019ve also received approval on 575/576 of ETF applications.\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say- there is no chance, and I mean zero, that this ETF is approved with Binance in\u2026 \u2014 Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) June 16, 2023\n\nAlso Read: With Binance market dominance under threat, experts say path for spot Bitcoin ETF is now clear\n\nBitcoin price tests key support\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing weakness, recording a 3% fall on the day, with most of these losses recorded following news around Binance exchange. Testing the critical support at $36,788 and with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing weakening momentum, BTC could fall.\n\nIncreased selling pressure below the $36,788 mean threshold of the supply zone stretching from $36,276 to $37,301 could open the drains for an extended fall, with experts anticipating a crash to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlready, the Awesome Oscillator\u2019s (AO) histogram bars are soaked in red and inching closer to the midline by the day. This points to the bears steadily taking over.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, increased buying pressure from investors looking to capitalize on the retest of $36,788 could send Bitcoin price north, first clearing the local top at $37,972 before testing the range high at $37,980 and ultimately claiming the $40,000 psychological level, 10% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds above critical support at $36,788 as Binance CEO CZ begins BTC halving countdown\n\nEthereum price struggles to keep $1,935 support base\n\nEthereum (ETH) price risks losing the critical support at $1,935, marking the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker that extend between $1,864 and $2,004. If the $1,935 level fails to hold, it could spell doom for token holders, with ETH likely sliding to the $1,800 psychological level, or in the dire case, invalidating the bullish thesis below $1,753.\n\nBoth the RSI and the AO support this outlook, edging south as momentum continues to fade.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure, enough to vindicate Ethereum price from the grasp of the aforementioned supply barrier above $2,009 could spur optimism, setting ETH back above the ascending trendline. This could clear the skies for a stretch to $2,136, denoting a 10% ascent from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price dilemma or buy signal before 60% rally"
