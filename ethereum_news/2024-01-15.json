The upgrade is being tested and is expected to be released later in Q1 2024. Ethereum promises an exciting 2024 with much-hyped launches of EigenLayer and Blast as well as a potential spot ETF approval.\n\nPrimer\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a distributed blockchain computing platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts have enabled the creation of various new assets and industries, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and more. It features an execution engine optimized for smart contract processing, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nEthereum utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where users can run validators to secure the network and participate in block production. Users that meet the hardware requirements, run the latest execution and consensus clients, and deposit 32 ETH into the Beacon Deposit Contract can permissionlessly operate an Ethereum validator.\n\nInstead of scaling at the base layer, Ethereum has chosen a scaling strategy through a network of Layer-2 protocols. Through this strategy, Ethereum plans to scale while maintaining a high degree of decentralization. These protocols rely on Ethereum for data availability and security, while they only focus on fast execution. Ethereum is planning a network upgrade in Q1 2024 that will allow it to better serve the needs of these protocols by creating a separate transaction type to store data and reduce the costs for the Layer-2s.\n\nWebsite / Twitter\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nA single job-risking (probably job-costing) fake X (formerly Twitter) post was all it took for investor interest and sidelined capital to return to crypto. On October 16, 2023, the Cointelegraph X account published that the Bitcoin spot ETF had been approved. The market reacted instantly, with BTC surging by 7% from $28,000 to $30,000. While the news was later confirmed to be fake, the market had shown its hand. Investors and capital realized that the Bitcoin spot ETF approval would be a big catalyst and piled in. So ended the two-year-long crypto bear market and began the first leg of the current crypto cycle.\n\nETH performed well, with its price surging by 37% for the quarter, however, it was the second worst-performing non-stable asset above $10 billion. It underperformed both its larger peer Bitcoin, and younger platform chain challengers like Solana and Avalanche. Bitcoin was driven by the ETF narrative, while the younger platform chains saw a sentiment reversion after being sold off more heavily during the bear market.\n\nHowever, not all was bad for Ethereum. With a broad recovery in sentiment, fundamental ETH metrics improved compared to last quarter. Over the quarter, 216,000 ETH was issued, but 270,000 ETH was burnt through transaction fees. This burn led to a net deflation of 50,000+ ETH at an annualized deflation rate of 0.2%.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, certain high volatility periods generated greater real yields for validators, but there were no events of similar magnitude in the second half. In Q4, the annualized real yield for stakers was 4.3%, flat compared to the previous quarter. The growing amount of ETH staked and lower MEV opportunities meant validator rewards were lower by 0.2%. However, their impact on real yield was offset by higher net annualized deflation for the quarter of 0.2%, compared to the previous quarter\u2019s inflation of 0%.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nCensorship Resistance and Decentralization\n\nIt seems that every quarter, a new attack vector on Ethereum surfaces. Like the Lernaean Hydra, as one head is dealt with, another takes its place.\n\nIn Q4 2022, relays were censoring transactions by addresses sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This threat was mitigated by Flashbots open-sourcing its relay, allowing for more competition. In the subsequent quarters, relay censorship fell below 50%.\n\nThe next attack vector surfaced in Q3 2023, with block builders increasingly censoring transactions. This remains high at 60-70%, with potential solutions under discussion.\n\nIn Q4 2023, Ethereum is facing a new threat. Some validators are playing \u201ctiming games\u201d where they propose a block slightly later but still in time to meet the network cutoff. Proposing the block later gives them more time to capture greater MEV. However, this is a zero-sum game, as the excess MEV captured in one block lowers the MEV of the next block. Further, if all validators delay their blocks, no one captures excess MEV, and a new equilibrium is reached. However, blocks being built later do have negative implications for the network.\n\nIt encourages validator colocation to reduce latency. A validator that is closely located with other validators can propose a block later and still meet the network cutoff. As such, it penalizes geographically distributed home stakers and rewards professionally managed colocated validators.\n\nDelays in proposing blocks may lead to more missed blocks, causing greater network instability.\n\nThe core developers have suggested some solutions to discourage and mitigate the impact of these timing games. A short-term solution is coordinating the relay layer to enforce block requests at an earlier time. Longer-term solutions include adding explicit penalties for missing blocks, rewarding earlier block production, and introducing variable block times.\n\nTransactions and User Activity\n\nIn Q4, average daily transactions grew sequentially by 6% to 1.07 million, the highest for any quarter in 2023. However, the growth was led by simple wallet transfers, stablecoins, and infrastructure transactions. Layer-2, NFT, and DeFi transactions declined over the quarter by 29%, 9%, and 5%, respectively. The fall in Layer-2 transactions may be explained by hype receding from friend.tech, which had peaked in Q3.\n\nAs user interest increased, active addresses trended slightly higher for the quarter, growing by 4% to ~400,000. However, there was slower growth in unique addresses, suggesting fewer new users joined. The growth rate in unique addresses fell for the second quarter in a row, down to just 3% in Q4, compared to 4% in Q3 and 5% in Q2 2023.\n\nEcosystem and Development Overview\n\nRollup Network\n\nThrough all the ups and downs, a trend is emerging clearly that Ethereum is actually scaling through its rollup network. Major rollups have cumulatively increased Ethereum\u2019s throughput by almost three times to 4 million average daily transactions. There was a boost in L2 activity in December as inscriptions mania spread beyond Bitcoin to Ethereum rollups.\n\nzkSync Era had the highest transaction activity in Q4 at 900,000 average daily transactions. Sequential rollup transaction growth came from Linea, Arbitrum, and Scroll. Linea transactions grew 3x to 300,000, Arbitrum transactions increased by 30% to 800,000, and Scroll was a new launch in Q4 with average daily transactions of 120,000.\n\nSectoral Performance\n\nEthereum\u2019s total value locked (TVL) grew by 35% to $30 billion, in line with its price performance. Lending protocols Spark and Aave had the highest growth among the top applications, growing by 286% and 33%, respectively. Curve DEX underperformed, with its TVL falling by 13% for its fourth down quarter in a row.\n\nBlast, a rollup by the Blur team, and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, were new entrants among the top applications. While neither product is live, they each attracted TVL of more than $1 billion with points incentives with the promise of a future airdrop. Blast and EigenLayer collect most of their TVL in liquid staked tokens (LST) of ETH and, invariably, further incentivize liquid ETH staking.\n\nWith growing incentives to stake ETH, its staking ratio has grown throughout the year. The staking ratio almost doubled in 2023, growing from 13% to 24%. However, the growth rate was somewhat slower in Q4. There was a net inflow of only 2 million ETH into the staking contract in Q4, compared to 3.6 million in Q3. Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lender, in preparation for the distribution of its assets, has been unstaking its ETH.\n\nIn Q4, among the large staking entities, Lido, Coinbase, and Rocket Pool grew their ETH staked by 5-6%, while Binance and Figment saw outflows of 9% and 3%, respectively. A large part of the growth in Q4 2023 came from smaller liquid staking protocols like Ether.Fi, Stader, and Swell, whose ETH stake grew by 200%+. EigenLayer has been a key catalyst in promoting the growth of long-tail LST protocols, as it allowed deposits for multiple LSTs.\n\nWith higher prices and greater user interest, volumes surged on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Daily volumes through Q4 2023 averaged $1.3 billion, up 26% from Q3. Uniswap was the primary driver for volume growth, with its average daily volumes growing by $330 million to $930 million. Curve, Dodo, Maverick, and Balancer all had lower volumes in Q4 2023 compared to Q3 2023, with the largest fall in Curve volumes of 35% to $140 million.\n\nSimilar to DEXs, NFT marketplace volumes recovered over Q4 2023. Daily average NFT volumes grew by 31% in Q4 to $15 million, reversing the trend of the last two quarters. It was the sector leader again that led the growth, with Blur volumes growing by 38% sequentially to $10 million. Daily average OpenSea volumes grew by 23% to $4 million. Smaller challengers, LooksRare and X2Y2, lost market share as their volumes dropped by 52% and 8%, respectively.\n\nDevelopment Activity\n\nCrypto has lost developers over the 2 years of the bear market. As sentiment turns, we expect this trend to flip. Ethereum has fared somewhat better than its peers for developer retention. Its share of weekly active developers has increased to 31%, marginally better sequentially and 1% higher compared to Q4 2022. As Ethereum\u2019s rollup infrastructure grows and attracts more opportunities, it may retain its developer share even in a bull market.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nCancun and Deneb Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s vision of scaling through rollups is materializing. Ethereum rollups now have significantly more transactions than the mainnet, and as they become more battle-tested, they likely benefit from a TVL migration from the mainnet.\n\nHowever, despite all the optimizations in compressing and posting data to Ethereum, rollups are still an order of magnitude more expensive than alt-Layer-1s in terms of transaction costs. The greatest challenge for rollups is competing with Ethereum mainnet applications for block space and paying higher gas prices when Layer-1 trends drive up usage. The next upgrade to Ethereum, Cancun-Deneb (Dencun), seeks to address this issue through EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce a new transaction type to Ethereum where rollups may post data to be stored in blobs by Ethereum validators for a short period of time. This data is stored on the consensus layer (CL) clients and does not interact with the execution layer (EL). As such, blobs will not only significantly reduce the costs of rollup transactions, but they will also make their costs independent of any Layer-1 transactions. Rollup transactions will likely become as cheap, if not cheaper, than alt-L1s after the upgrade.\n\nDencun is also expected to include other ecosystem upgrades, such as EIP-1153, EIP-4788, and EIP-7514.\n\nEIP-1153 is the foundation for Uniswap\u2019s upcoming V4 implementation, as it relies on the transient storage opcodes in the upgrade.\n\nEIP-4788 will expose CL data to the EL, increasing the scope for innovation in staking pools like Rocket Pool.\n\nEIP-7514 caps the churn rate for Ethereum validators, reducing the rate at which more ETH is staked. This is a stop-gap solution aimed to buy time for researchers to figure out a more long-term solution for controlling the amount of ETH staked.\n\nDencun is expected to go live on the Goerli testnet on January 17, 2024, with Sepolia and Holesky testnet upgrades in the following weeks. There is no planned date for the mainnet release, but it is expected later in Q1 2024.\n\nPrague and Electra Upgrades\n\nAfter Dencun, the Prague and Electra (Pectra) fork is next. The upgrades in Pectra are still under discussion, but there seem to be two major camps -\n\nThe Geth client team wants to prioritize upgrading Ethereum\u2019s state organization to Verkle tree proofs instead of the current Merkle Patricia tree proofs. This upgrade will help Ethereum unlock stateless clients, reducing the storage requirement for validators and helping the blockchain scale. However, this would be a more complex upgrade, taking over a year to ship.\n\nThe other camp, which includes Nethermind, Besu, Reth, and other execution client teams, wants a smaller feature upgrade before focusing fully on Verkle. These other upgrades may include the following EIPs - EIP-7002 will let execution layer transactions trigger exits on the consensus layer. This upgrade helps liquid staking protocols kick any offending validators. EIP-7251 allows the maximum effective balance on the consensus layer to exceed 32 ETH, allowing for easier compounding for solo stakers and fewer validators for large node operators.\n\n\n\nThe client teams will finalize the upgrade plan in the coming months, and the release will vary based on its scope.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nEthereum had a strong end to the year 2023 as market sentiment improved. All its key fundamental metrics returned to growth after a few quarters of decline, with very strong growth in its rollup ecosystem. However, despite all the positives, ETH was far from central to the crypto narrative as top dog BTC and younger platforms like SOL and AVAX stole the show.\n\nGoing into the new year, ETH has a slew of upcoming positive developments. The much-awaited Dencun upgrade promises to bring new life and lower transaction fees to its rollup network. Additionally, EigenLayer and Blast launched could create a wealth effect for the ETH faithfuls. Finally, after the BTC spot ETF approval, all eyes have turned to a potential spot ETH spot ETF approval. As the second largest crypto asset and the only other crypto asset with a futures ETF, the path for the ETF may be clear. 2024 promises to be exciting!\n\nLet us know what you loved about the report, what may be missing, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form.

        "content": "Finding the next big thing is the secret sauce for many investors, whether it\u2019s startups, stocks, bonds, commodities or crypto.\n\nObsession with discovering \u201cthe next Ethereum\u201d \u2014 or even an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d \u2014 then seems only natural.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts set the industry standard nearly a decade ago and have since inspired dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands, of rival networks.\n\nSolana is generally considered Ethereum\u2019s primary competitor right now. Comparing market values shows nothing has really come close to eclipsing Ethereum. Yet.\n\nIn fact, BNB Chain (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have come the closest over the past three years.\n\nThe market cap of BNB in April 2021 and late 2022 was about 33% of ether\u2019s (ETH).\n\nADA had up to 25% of ether\u2019s cap during the last bull market.\n\nSolana (SOL) set a new record relative to ether last month with 19%.\n\nRead more: It\u2019s a Solanaissance: These 5 charts will cure the Ethereum vibecession\n\nPrice ratios \u2014 dividing one assets\u2019 price by another and comparing over time \u2014 are commonly used to gauge the relative strength of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnalyzing price alone is problematic due to inflation and deflation rates of many top cryptocurrencies.\n\nSolana\u2019s market cap ratio against ether has retraced by a quarter since Christmas, now about 14%\n\nTake ATOM, the native asset for multichain ecosystem Cosmos. Over the past year, ATOM\u2019s circulating supply has swelled by a third and its token price has slipped by 20%, according to data from The Tie.\n\nMeanwhile, ATOM\u2019s market cap has grown 15%. Price alone implies ATOM is struggling, when it could be the market is simply absorbing fresh supply \u2014 and then some.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, has almost 17% more circulating supply than this time last year. Its price has quadrupled across that period, while its market cap has nearly quintupled. Comparing only SOL\u2019s price would leave a chunk of the asset\u2019s growth unaccounted for.\n\nMuch of Solana\u2019s outsized growth over the past year can be attributed to its gradual recovery since the FTX debacle.\n\nRead more: Rebuilding trust: Solana\u2019s roadmap after a challenging year\n\nDisgraced FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a significant investor in Solana and its ecosystem, leading SOL to collapse by up to 65% directly following FTX\u2019s implosion in late 2022. Ether fell less than 30% and completely recovered in about two months.\n\nMarket caps are just one metric by which to compare cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Total value locked, unique addresses, on-chain volumes, developer activity, fee revenues and transaction counts are among others. Each has its flaws.\n\nIn any case, Ethereum isn\u2019t exactly threatened right now.

        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 3 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Although Ethereum appears to be getting lost in the fray, it has quietly climbed to its best level in nearly two years. But can that continue?\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.17%) is a cryptocurrency that really doesn't get as much attention as it probably should. Over the past week, that's certainly true, with any sort of discussion around Ethereum dwarfed by the massive catalyst that hit the overall crypto sector -- the highly anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.17%) ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThis key catalyst initially drove a significant amount of buying interest in Bitcoin but has since given way to outperformance for Ethereum. As it turns out, investors are clearly focused on the next crypto with a big catalyst on the horizon, which could certainly be the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs. Given the rather positive stance regulators have taken with Ethereum, market anticipation around such an event has driven Ethereum upward this week to levels not seen since spring 2022.\n\nNow, the question is whether this momentum can continue. For long-term investors, the question of where Ethereum may be in three years' time is one that is certainly worth trying to answer.\n\nNo one knows where any asset will ultimately end up over any given period of time, and I'm not going to suggest I have a crystal ball. However, I'll attempt to at least rationalize why I think Ethereum will more likely than not continue to move higher over the next three years and potentially surge past its previous highs.\n\nEthereum ETF hype should be taken seriously\n\nIt's not just crypto bros, talking heads, and pundits suggesting spot Ethereum ETFs could be on the horizon. There's been some rather compelling commentary from big-name investors around the potential approval of such investing vehicles, with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink opining on this topic.\n\nFink noted in a recent interview that he believes there's \"value\" in a spot Ethereum ETF being launched at some point. His view is that Ethereum is among the most viable assets within the crypto space, and while these aren't necessarily currencies by technical definition, they do carry value similar to other assets like gold. That's a rather widespread view among mainstream investors, and given the SEC's stance toward Bitcoin and Ethereum, if regulators take a similar view, it's certainly likely we could see spot Ethereum ETFs on the horizon.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Blackrock is among the companies that have applied for a spot Ethereum ETF already. So, perhaps there's some level of \"talking his book\" that investors need to price in. But given the interest major institutional investors have in promoting digital assets as a viable investment-grade option, Ethereum certainly has a future catalyst investors need to watch closely.\n\nTokenization likely to remain a key catalyst for Ethereum investors\n\nThe tokenization of real-world assets, or the ability to trade rights to physical assets such as art, collectibles, or even real estate, is a trend that's continuing to gain steam. In 2023, it's been estimated that the total value of all real-world assets that have been tokenized and trade on the blockchain has doubled, from around $1 billion at the start of 2023 to $2 billion at year's end. Notably, much of the trading volume in this nascent space has taken place on Ethereum's network, given its scale and ubiquity among users in the decentralized finance sector.\n\nEthereum's pole position as the leading blockchain for anything tied to decentralized finance (including tokenized real-world assets) benefits investors. Ethereum's token price has proven to be correlated over long periods of time to its network activity. Considering Ethereum's impressive ecosystem growth over the years, some investors have called into question where the next growth catalyst will come from. In the past, gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) alongside other financial services took center stage. But given the nascent nature of the tokenized real-world assets market, this could be the next growth catalyst that drives Ethereum's fundamentals, and its price, higher over time.\n\nDoes Ethereum have what it takes to make new highs over the next three years?\n\nLong-term investors can find plenty of other catalysts to focus on when it comes to Ethereum. After all, this ecosystem is vast and supports a great deal of the utility created in the crypto space. The launch of an ETF, continued growth in tokenization, and future Ethereum-network upgrades all remain key catalysts to watch over the next three years. However, who knows, maybe a bigger and more prominent catalyst will materialize. After all, this innovative space continues to evolve in rapid fashion, and I wouldn't rule it out.\n\nMy view is that over the next three years, Ethereum will continue to see the sort of volatility it's seen in the past. But given its fundamental tailwinds, and the potential for the macro- and monetary-policy environments to improve, I think it's far more likely that Ethereum makes new highs rather than multiyear lows."

With over $13 trillion in assets under management (AUM), BlackRock is one of the largest asset management firms in the world.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s entry into the fray raised optimism about Bitcoin derivatives and effectively spun the rumor mill.\n\nAs of June 15, Blackrock\u2019s official filing date, Bitcoin price was trading around $24,800. Within the first two weeks, speculators who aped-in early on the rumor sent Bitcoin price rallying 25% to hit $30,000 for the first time in 12 months, dating back to June 2022.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action in build-up to spot ETF Approval June 2023 \u2013 Jan. 15, 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nBetween June 15 and Jan. 11, when the SEC eventually confirmed the news, Bitcoin price nearly doubled, moving from $24,800 to a local top of $48,890. This effectively sent speculators who bought the rumor after BlackRock\u2019s filing into 97% profit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the wave of profit-taking that ensued in the aftermath of the SEC approval has sent BTC price spiraling to 15% toward $42,500 as of Jan. 15. This affirms the full cycle of the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news cycle on the spot Bitcoin ETF narrative.\n\nWith the Bitcoin ETF now at a conclusion, investors have switched focus to Ethereum. BlackRock had filed for spot Ethereum ETF on Nov. 16. In a recent interview on Jan. 12, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink re-emphasized the value of an Ethereum spot ETF as an asset class.\n\nWhile the BTC price has dropped by 3.8%, Ethereum has increased by 13.5% in the past week. In effect, ETH price has outperformed BTC by approximately 10%.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) price performance \u2013 Jan. 9 \u2013 Jan. 15, 2024. Source: Coin360\n\nInterestingly, in addition to this divergent interplay between ETH and BTC price movement over the past week, strategic on-chain movements from Ethereum whales since Jan. 11 also corroborate early signals of the buy-the-rumor strategy playing out in ETH markets.\n\nEthereum whales have acquired $1.4 billion ETH since Bitcoin ETF approval verdict\n\nOn paper, Ethereum price has outperformed BTC by 10% in the past week, per Coin360 data. Looking beyond the price charts, a vital on-chain indicator has revealed that ETH\u2019s performance has been boosted by corporate entities and high net-worth investors who increased their buy pressure shortly after the Bitcoin ETF approval verdict.\n\nSantiment\u2019s \u2018supply held by top addresses\u2019 metric shows a real-time snapshot of the aggregate balances currently controlled by the largest wallets in a crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe latest readings show that the top 1,000 Ethereum wallets held just 66 million ETH in cumulative balances as of Jan. 10.\n\nBut since the focus switched to spot Ethereum ETF, strategic ETH investors have entered a buying spree, adding 570,000 ETH to bring their balances to 66.5 million ETH at press time on Jan. 15.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply held by top addresses | Source: Santiment\n\nValued at the current price of $2,540, the Ethereum \u2018top holder supply\u2019 chart above illustrates that the top 1,000 investors have added ETH coins worth $1.4 billion to their holdings in the last four days alone.\n\nIntuitively, when the largest stakeholders increase their balances rapidly by hundreds of millions, it is interpreted as a strong bullish signal. Firstly, the buying trend among the largest stakeholders increases overall confidence within the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nGiven that large holders are often likely to hold longer than small-holder swing traders, this accumulation puts ETH in a prime position to score historic gains in the weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum market dominance climbs after spot Bitcoin ETF approval | Source: TradingView\n\nBut more importantly, the timing of the recent buying spree suggests that investors are buying the rumor with optimism that Bitcoin\u2019s ETF approval will increase the likelihood that ongoing ETH applications will also obtain a positive verdict from the SEC.\n\nThe Ethereum Dominance (ETH.D) chart further affirms this stance. Ethereum has cornered 14% more market share between Jan. 10 and Jan. 15, while Bitcoin price has declined at a nearly identical 15%.\n\nThis suggests that speculative traders are selling the news on BTC, rapidly buying the rumor ahead of a possible spot ETH ETF approval verdict.\n\nETH price forecast: can Ethereum reach $5,000 in 2024?\n\nFrom the data points analyzed above, the large holder wallets\u2019 accumulation and the rising ETH dominance suggest that the buy-the-rumor strategy is now widely in play in the Ethereum markets.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin had scored 97% gains in the build-up to the spot ETF approval verdict, a similar performance could put ETH in line to reach $5,000 in the instance of a positive outcome.\n\nBut in the short term, the ETH bulls will have to scale the $2,900 resistance to keep the momentum going. IntoTheBlock\u2019s Global In/Out of the Money chart, which highlights potential support/resistance points using the historical entry prices of current ETH holders, also supports this ETH prediction\n\nIt shows that with ETH prices currently trading above $2,500, 91% of all ETH holders are now in profit positions. With the ETH ETF approval process on the front burner, these holders could increasingly become less inclined to sell.\n\nHowever, the 8.5 million Ethereum holders who bought 4.1 million ETH coins could pose significant resistance if they book early profits as prices approach their break-even point.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price forecast | Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe bears could negate this bullish prediction if the ETH price unexpectedly retreats below $2,000. However, 7.9 million investors acquired 43.4 million ETH at the maximum price of $2,039.\n\nConsidering this is the largest cluster of ETH current holders, they will likely have enough in the tank to overturn such bearish pressure."

        "title": "Can Ethereum flip Bitcoin by 2030? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS puts it on course to give Bitcoin a fight.\n\nA prediction said that Ethereum\u2019s revenue could hit $51 billion by 2030 while ETH may hit $11,848.\n\nDestiny cannot be denied. It can only be delayed. This statement explains the sentiment of those who believe that Ethereum [ETH] will flip Bitcoin [BTC] by 2030. However, this discussion has been going on for a long time.\n\nBut at the time of writing, Ethereum had not yet flipped Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nDespite the state of things, some Ethereum supporters argue that the flipping would happen. AMBCrypto checked if there was any time that the smart contract blockchain came close to overtaking Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to data from Blockchain Center, Ethereum\u2019s market dominance rose to 36.9% in June 2017.\n\nAt that, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance was around 44.4%. Eventually, the flipping did not happen. But between that period and now, a lot of things have changed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s new model changes Bitcoin\u2019s operation\n\nOne of the major changes was Ethereum\u2019s move away from Proof-of-Work (PoW). Up until September 2022, both Bitcoin and Ethereum utilized the PoW consensus mechanism.\n\nThe PoW mechanism allows the verification of transactions through miners. In this case, miners get rewards for adding computation power to the network. But Ethereum stopped using that method and transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) during a major upgrade called \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nWith PoS, Ethereum no longer needs miners but validators. Here, users don\u2019t have to be miners, and they also get rewarded for validating new blocks of transactions.\n\nThis \u201cease\u201d has aided Ethereum\u2019s popularity. It is also one of the reasons some predictions are confident that Bitcoin will play second-fiddle by 2030.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has not been resting on its oars. Recent developments have proven that the Satoshi Nakamoto-developed project could be ready to fight Ethereum pound for pound.\n\nCompetition escalates between the kings\n\nThis assertion could be linked to the creation of NFTs on the Bitcoin network. During the 2021 bull market, NFTs got popular, and most of them were built on the Ethereum blockchain. For this reason, demand for ETH increased.\n\nHowever, the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals in 2023 Q1 has ensured that Ethereum has intense competition in that regard. AMBCrypto looked at CryptoSlam\u2019s data and found that Bitcoin was giving its opposite number a run for its money.\n\nAt press time, NFT seven-day sales on the Ethereum blockchain were $92.39 million. Bitcoin was a close second with $90.18 million within the same period.\n\nSo, if demand for ETH rises as a result of these assets, there is a high chance that BTC also follow. Should this remain the same case, Ethereum flipping Bitcoin by 2030 would be difficult.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum dominating the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space makes a strong case for the flipping. This is major because of its smart contract functionalities.\n\nAt the peak of the bull market in 2021, Ethereum\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $97 billion.\n\nThe TVL determines the total value of digital assets locked in a protocol. So, the increase at that time implied that market participants trusted the project enough to continuously add liquidity to it.\n\n5 figures for ETH by 2030?\n\nThis DeFi dominance is why some analysts believe that the Vitalik Buterin-led project can bite into Bitcoin\u2019s market share. For example, in May 2023, VanEck predicted that the blockchain\u2019s revenue could rise as high as $51 billion by 2023.\n\nThe research also mentioned that Ethereum\u2019s dominance among smart contracts protocols could rise to 70%. The mutual fund and ETF management firm also talked about the price, noting,\n\n\u201cIn our Base Case, we assume that Ethereum will achieve $51B in annual revenue in the year ending 4/30/2030. We deduct a validator fee from this total, 1%, and a global tax rate of 15%, and we arrive at cash flows of $42.90B to Ethereum. Assuming an FCF multiple of 33x, 120.7M token, we come to a Base Case 2030 Price Target of $11,848 per token.\u201d\n\nOn an all-time basis, ETH\u2019s price has increased by 89,382.45%. BTC, on the other hand, had seen its value rise by 68,863,742%. By comparing both prices, one can assume that ETH was undervalued massively undervalued compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there have been predictions that the Bitcoin price could rise higher. One of the reasons could be linked to the recently-approved Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nWith the ETF approval, more institutional capital is expected to flow into Bitcoin. This could also affect the price action positively. As a result of this, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that BTC could cross the $1 million mark by 2030.\n\nEthereum flips Bitcoin here\n\nIn the meantime, analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin spot ETF approval was a signal for ETH to shine. According to him, the development could force liquidity rotation into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we'll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nBut will this lead to Ethereum flipping Bitcoin? Well, that might be hard to decide, considering that an Ethereum spot ETF could be approved before or by May 2024.\n\nRegarding the number of holders, AMBCrypto analysis of Santiment showed that BTC had 52.76 million. ETH, on the other hand, had more than double that at 112.52 million.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin by 2030? Our verdict\n\nThis data indicated that Ethereum had experienced more adoption than Bitcoin. If the growth continues in this manner, then it could increase its chances of flipping Bitcoin by 2030.\n\nAnother possible impact of the flipping is the supply. For Bitcoin, it has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This is one of the reasons Ethereum might find it hard to flip it.\n\nBecause if demand for BTC increases with its fixed supply, the price and market cap will go higher.\n\nThe supply of ETH, however, is unlimited. But the project, thanks to its burning mechanism, ensures that demand matches the ETH supply.\n\nAlso, the shift to PoS had greatly impacted the tokenomics. This is also one of the reasons market participants have stuck to ETH since it became a yield-generating asset.\n\nGiven its different use cases, demand from retail and institutions alike is expected to increase.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nBut to flip Bitcoin would be a hard nut to crack. Furthermore, 2030 is a long time to predict what would happen with both projects.\n\nBut considering the recent developments, Ethereum might get very close to flipping Bitcoin. However, it is not guaranteed that the former would surpass the number one cryptocurrency by that time."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nShiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.\n\nSHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nEthereum's correction is temporary\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\n\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nBitcoin's dominance not going anywhere\n\nAfter a brief breach below the 50-day EMA \u2014 a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment \u2014 Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\n\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\n\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet."

        "title": "An Introduction to ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) Standard - Unchained",
        "content": "The new ERC-4337 token standard enables account abstraction for Ethereum users, allowing for the creation of easier-to-use \u201csmart wallets.\u201d\n\nA significant impediment to crypto adoption is the complexity of account management. But that could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s newest token standard, ERC-4337.\n\nThis guide will explain what ERC-4337 is, how it works, and its significance to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat Is the ERC-4337 Token Standard?\n\nERC-4337 is an account abstraction standard for the Ethereum blockchain, seeking to improve user experience and security by introducing smart contract functionality in wallets.\n\nThe standard is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s and other developers\u2019 brainchild, conceptualized in 2021.\n\nWhat Is Account Abstraction?\n\nIn most blockchain systems, users manage their transactions through Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). These accounts require them to own private keys and use them to process each transaction, creating challenges such as security risks, limited functionality, and usage complexity.\n\nTo address these challenges, Ethereum is adopting account abstraction.\n\nThis blockchain concept shifts user transactions away from exclusive dependence on EOAs. Instead, it embeds smart contracts in users\u2019 wallets, allowing them to interact with other contracts and thus complete exchanges automatically.\n\nBesides automating transactions, these \u201csmart wallets\u201d can determine the appropriate gas fees a user should incur in each exchange. They also support advanced security features, as we shall see later.\n\nKey Features of the ERC-4337 Standard\n\nA deep dive into the ERC-4337 standard reveals the following key features:\n\nUser Operations (UserOps) : Imagine it as a list of all the actions you provide your Ethereum account to execute.\n\nBundlers : The nodes that submit UserOps to the network for verification.\n\nEntryPoin t: The smart contract that performs UserOps.\n\nPaymaster : This entity manages the gas payment system.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nERC-4337 token standard transactions undergo a four-stage process.\n\nThe first is the initiation of UserOps, which are instructions for the desired actions, for example, sending tokens. The unconfirmed transactions go to an alternative mempool specifically built for ERC-4337 exchanges.\n\nThe bundlers then select several UserOps from the mempool and pack them into a single transaction called the bundle. Gas fees are the primary determinant of which UserOp the bundlers prioritize. From here, they send the bundle to EntryPoint, a global smart contract on the Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nFor validation, bundlers trigger the \u201chandleOps\u201d call function on the EntryPoint. That allows the smart contract to receive the bundle transactions. Consequently, it requests a \u201cvalidate UserOp\u201d function for every account, enabling authentication of the operation\u2019s signature.\n\nOnce everything checks out, the EntryPoint processes the appropriate gas fees. Every ERC-4337 wallet must then perform another function to complete the transaction sent to them by the EntryPoint contract. Bundlers receive payments for each successful UserOp to incentivize their facilitation of the process.\n\nBenefits and Limitations of ERC-4337\n\nAccording to its proponents, ERC-4337 will fundamentally transform Ethereum for the better. But as with any technology, it also has its downsides. Let\u2019s look at its potential positives and negatives.\n\nPros\n\nEnhanced Security: The token standard removes the complexity of managing private keys and seed phrases, enhancing security with two-factor authentication and biometrics.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: The standard works across multiple blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nPotential Scalability: ERC-4337 batches transactions akin to rollups, which could increase the Ethereum network\u2019s throughput for the benefit of its users.\n\nSupports multi-party transactions: ERC-4337 supports creating shared dealings with other parties through multi-signature operations and sponsored transactions, enabling a third party, such as a dApp or another wallet, to pay your gas fees.\n\nSocial wallet recovery: With ERC-4337, you can whitelist certain addresses to assist in account recovery if you lose your logins.\n\nCons\n\nIt lacks true account abstraction: Currently, ERC-4337 only provides an off-chain medium for managing your transactions before sending them to the mainnet. Proper account abstraction is more comprehensive, requiring a significant update of Ethereum\u2019s consensus protocol.\n\nIncreased DoS risk: The standard\u2019s complex verification process could heighten exposure to denial-of-service (DoS) exploits.\n\nLimited Transaction Volumes: ERC-4337 accounts can only send one transaction to the mempool at a time.\n\nPotentially Higher Gas Costs: Adopters of ERC-4337 transactions could pay more gas than they would do in regular transactions.\n\nWhat Is the Role of the ERC-4337 Standard to Ethereum Users?\n\nThe ERC-4337 token standard is still developing in the Ethereum network and will likely grow in adoption and function. Adopters can put its features to many uses, including:\n\nCustomizing spending: Users can tailor-make their transactions by setting wallet usage instructions and spending limits. Again, they can activate notifications for certain margins. This way, their smart wallets will act similarly to the regular credit card.\n\nSubscribing to Web3 services: As the standard supports account programming, users can factor in periodic spending in their wallet\u2019s code. Similarly, they can set up other crypto-specific pay-to-use plans.\n\nAutomating DeFi functions: Your smart wallet readily interacts with different decentralized applications critical to the DeFi sector . So you can instruct it to automate certain DeFi functions, like seeking the best liquidity pools for your funds.\n\nMulti-token gas payments: ERC-4337 expands your gas-paying options because its account abstraction feature facilitates fee payment with any ERC-20 token. That eliminates the need to hold or convert your holdings to a particular token for gas payments.\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe deployment of the ERC-4337 token standard on the Ethereum mainnet has stirred the crypto community for good reasons. Chief among them is its ability to streamline the crypto adoption process. That said, it comes with its fair share of challenges necessitating care in its adoption.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s for sure is that it is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to alter the Web3 user experience."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered a substantial obstacle following a significant surge last week.\n\nThe market is currently correcting, and traders are wondering whether a reversal is on the horizon.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been very bullish over the last quarter of 2023, increasing by more than $1,000. Recently, ETH has experienced an aggressive rally toward the $2,700 resistance zone. However, this level has decisively rejected the price, and a correction toward the $2,400 area has begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index still demonstrates values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish and the price is likely to continue its uptrend after the correction is done.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is clear that ETH\u2019s price has formed a double-top pattern at the $2,700 resistance level. The relative strength index also signaled that the asset is overbought in this timeframe.\n\nCurrently, the price is forming lower highs and lows, potentially targeting the $2,400 level in the short term. Yet, this level seems likely to hold the price and initiate a rebound back toward the $2,700 level afterward, as the overall market structure is still bullish.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price is still continuing its bullish trend, some worrying signs are arising from the derivatives market. It is beneficial to have a closer look to determine whether a bearish reversal can be expected or not.\n\nThis chart depicts the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, one of the most valuable metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Values over 1 indicate that the bulls are executing their orders more aggressively, while values below 1 point to the bearish selling pressure.\n\nWhile the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has never recovered above one during the recent uptrend, the price has been rallying higher. However, it is currently dropping rapidly, making a new low. This cannot be interpreted well, and the subsequent aggressive selling pressure by the futures trader can soon cause a considerable decline in price."

        "content": "There's an expected decline in Manta's TVL after January 18 due to participants claiming rewards from the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-two (L2) blockchain Manta Pacific registered more than $850 million in total value locked (TVL) today, and it is now the 4th largest L2 by TVL, according to data aggregator L2Beat. When compared to the $35 million in TVL on December 15, 2023, this represents more than 2,300% in monthly growth.\n\nThe relevant rise in TVL can be related to Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign, which started last year on December 14 and gave rewards to users who bridged Ethereum (ETH) to Manta Pacific. The rewards are \u2018box pieces\u2019 and when a user gets 25 of them, he\u2019s eligible to open a box and get a non-fungible token (NFT). Inviting friends with referral links also boosted the rewards.\n\nManta Pacific is a blockchain ecosystem built by Manta Network on Ethereum. It leverages Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology and uses Celestia, a modular blockchain, as its data availability layer. This architecture enables Manta Pacific to function as a zero-knowledge rollup (zk rollup) for Ethereum, offering scalability and privacy benefits.\n\nSince the start of the campaign, Manta\u2019s TVL has soared and reached an $870 million peak on January 12. However, this number could sharply decline after January 18, when users will be eligible to claim their rewards after participating in the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nA blog post published by Manta\u2019s team on January 15 reveals that 50 million MANTA tokens will be distributed to New Paradigm\u2019s participants. Another 50 million MANTA will be airdropped to users who interacted with the \u2018Into the Blue\u2019 event, which was similar to New Paradigm\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe value locked growth was not accompanied by a rise in activity and could be seen as a sign that the money flowing into Manta Pacific is coming from investors only interested in the airdrop.\n\nThus, the token distribution could be seen by investors as the end of the period when it\u2019s mandatory to lock ETH in Manta Pacific. Since 2024 is seen as \u2018airdrop season\u2019 by analysts, as Crypto Briefing reported, the money could quickly flow to other protocols where staking crypto is an eligibility requirement."

        "title": "Will Solana (SOL) Flip Ethereum (ETH)? One Key Metric Tells All - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Solana\u2019s meteoric rise to close out 2023 (91% gain over the past month) has left crypto enthusiasts pondering whether SOL can flip ETH as the second most-popular token.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently shared our thoughts on a Solana prediction for 2030 (hint: it\u2019s bullish), and also noted that analysts are predicting an uptrend for SOL in 2024.\n\nNow, we\u2019re going to need to zoom out a little to a \u201835,000-foot view\u2019 to see whether these short-term trends could lead to long-term implications.\n\nOne thing we should note is that sentiment in crypto changes rapidly.\n\nIt feels great to see a 90% gain over the span of a month \u2014 but it hurts to then see your favorite token decline 10% the following day.\n\nWill Solana Flip Ethereum?\n\nLet\u2019s get some other opinions here as we pull out our crystal ball.\n\nJulian Deschler, the Co-Founder of Elusiv, a Solana-based Web3 encryption layer, shed some insights on the topic.\n\nGranted, we do want to point out that he chose Solana for his project, an implicit bias toward the chain.\n\nIn a recent interview, Deschler first addressed why Solana had a breakout year in 2023.\n\nHe cited insanely high network speeds and increased dev activity as two primary reasons for picking SOL.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that he alluded to high gas fees on ETH being a deterrent to devs and investors alike.\n\nHe also shared his belief that Solana\u2019s growth isn\u2019t limited to the short term.\n\nWe agree on that point for the future, but let\u2019s cast some doubt on SOL flipping ETH anytime soon.\n\nMarket Cap Says Otherwise\n\nAs we can see from the drastic difference in market cap, SOL has significant ground to gain. That\u2019s not to say it couldn\u2019t happen in the next decade, but with institutional adoption coming soon (May?) via an ETH-spot ETF, it looks like the gap could grow wider. We\u2019ve been bull tweeting the $BTC etf since 25-28k Soon, we get to do this all again with the $ETH ETF in 2024 No matter what you believe, it\u2019s all game theory. as the date approaches people will be less willing to sell, and others will feel the need to buy $2,7xx and 3.4k\u2026 https://t.co/a1yufMX6l7 pic.twitter.com/bbO3EQIkNx \u2014 Pentoshi \ud83d\udc27 euroPeng \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa (@Pentosh1) December 23, 2023 In the short term, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Solana trade sideways for a bit, and see some reallocation go towards ETH in 2024. Solana vs. ETH NFTs As the crypto winter starts to thaw \u2014 price action has slowly warmed up for NFTs. The ETH vs. SOL battle rages on in the digital art world, with Ethereum leading the way. While Solana offers digital collectors and creators higher speeds and lower fees, the big money projects still live on ETH. Now, if you asked us whether I\u2019d rather own a Picasso painting or a Crypto Punk (ETH chain), we\u2019d take the Picasso. But if you ask us again tomorrow \u2014 we might opt for NFT history and side with a crypto punk. Our point being, things are changing so quickly in the world of blockchain. Massive upswings followed by violent downswings have become commonplace. This is why our conviction needs to remain high in all market conditions \u2014 even when you see the massive declines in price over the general NFT marketplace. This is to say that while SOL might be crowned \u2018crypto king\u2019 of 2023 \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t surprise us to see ETH outperform it in 2024. See related: Our ETH prediction for 2024 Summary We do not believe Solana will flip ETH in the next five-to-ten years. However, as blockchain enthusiasts/analysts, we are pleased to see each token competing and making the other stronger as a byproduct. We remain bullish on each SOL and ETH, but see ETH as being a more complete chain (except for those pesky gas fees) in the longer term. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

Soon you\u2019ll be able to\u2014again\u2014as Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs is bringing back its Dookey Dash game in a new free-to-play \u201cUnclogged\u201d edition thanks to a collaboration with game studio Faraway.\n\n\u201cLooks like Curtis needs to get the plunger out, there\u2019s something in the toilet,\u201d a post from Yuga Labs reads.\n\nThe crypto startup will bring Dookey Dash back sometime this quarter, according to the post. In the single-player original Dookey Dash, gamers had to race through a 3D sewer tunnel as an ape riding a vehicle underwater to gain as many points as possible while avoiding obstacles that, if hit, would eliminate them from the game.\n\nUnlike the first release\u2014which required a Sewer Pass NFT on Ethereum, granted free to Bored Ape and Mutant Ape NFT owners\u2014anyone will be able to play the sewer-themed endless runner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToken benefits for BAYC, MAYC, Kodas, BAKC, and HV-MTL. pic.twitter.com/4RHnb2tKtN \u2014 Yuga Labs Gaming (@yugalabsgaming) January 16, 2024\n\nDookey Dash saw quite a bit of competition during its previous launch. Back in February 2023, the pro Fortnite player known as \u201cMongraal\u201d won the first version of Dookey Dash with the highest score\u2014and sold his winning NFT key to billionaire Adam Weitsman for $1.63 million.\n\nThat said, those who do hold Yuga Labs Ethereum NFTs like Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Kodas, Bored Ape Kennel Club dogs, and HV-MTL Forge NFTs will be eligible for \u201ctoken benefits,\u201d according to the company. The trailer posted to Twitter shows ApeCoin logos, suggesting the Ethereum token for Yuga\u2019s Bored Ape ecosystem will be given out as rewards. However, a Yuga Labs representative would not confirm that detail.\n\nThe new Dookey Dash: Unclogged game will be released for iOS, Android, Mac desktop, and Windows desktop users\u2014suggesting it won\u2019t be a web browser-based game like before. Mobile and desktop app-based games tend to run more smoothly and securely than browser-based games, so this is a win for fans of the stinky original.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bored Ape and gaming influencer known as The Fortnite Guy or \u201cTFG,\u201d who was part of the latest Dookey Dash playtest and Yuga Labs\u2019 gaming council, added Tuesday that the game is slated for a mid-February launch and that select Yuga NFT holders may get more NFTs via the game.\n\nTFG showed a video that displays different playable character skins, new game vehicles, a leaderboard, and purchasable in-game currencies in the new upcoming game version. Yuga Labs\u2019 official gaming account on Twitter shared TFG\u2019s video.\n\nThe new version of Dookey Dash appears to offer \u201cCoins,\u201d \u201cBoosters,\u201d \u201cEnergy,\u201d \u201cSkip-It\u201d passes, and other items available for purchase using fiat currency. TFG also stated that coins can be earned by playing the game.\n\nDOOKEY DASH IS BACK!\ud83e\udd2f I've been invited to the @YugaLabsGaming council to playtest, create content, and work alongside the Yuga team to improve the game ahead of launch!\ud83d\ude4f There is SO MUCH new information about the game and I created a full length video discussing the updates\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MLFqaEw8e0 \u2014 TFG (@TFGmykL) January 16, 2024\n\nThe video also shows a new \u201cSewer Rank\u201d system to show the game\u2019s different competitive tiers. There\u2019s Amateur at the bottom, followed by Semi-Pro, Professional, All-Star, Champion, Hall of Famer, and GOAT listed as the game\u2019s ranked tiers, each with a different respective \u201cboost\u201d percentage. Players will be able to select different boosters before the game starts, with options like a \u201cslow booster,\u201d a \u201cmagnet booster,\u201d and a \u201cpower shart,\u201d for example.\n\nPresumably, the slow booster slows down the game to make it easier to navigate the cramped tunnels, while the magnet pulls in desirable items for the player to collect, and the \u201cpower shart\u201d is\u2026 well, mostly likely Dookey Dash\u2019s version of a very putrid nitro boost through the cartoonish game world.\n\nThe game\u2019s updated version and re-release appears to be an effort to draw in the broader crypto community. Hopefully, this new version won\u2019t suffer from quite the same levels of reported cheating and boosting as its original.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

They had also a good performance looking with their token, as Near had an increase of 200% since the beginning of the year, Klaytn a 20% and Arbitrum a 32% increase since its launch in March 2023.\u201d\n\nConversely, DappRadar says Ethereum rival Solana (SOL) recorded only 65,000 new UAWs in 2023, a 76% drop on a year-over-year basis. Web3-focused blockchain Hive (HIVE) saw 77,000 new UAWs, representing a 68% drop, as per the firm.\n\n\u201cSolana experienced a rough start of the year, influenced by its association with the FTX fallout. However, the Solana ecosystem saw an impressive recovery during the last months of 2023. Hive, primarily hosting the trading card game Splinterlands, also had a difficult year, missing financial targets and reporting significant losses.\u201d\n\nOverall, DappRadar says the DApp industry had a good run in 2023 with a 124% YoY increase in UAWs and ending the year with an average of 4.2 million daily UAWs.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, the DApp industry surpassed all expectations, and reinforced the notion that it\u2019s an enduring and evolving part of the global financial and technological landscape.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The investment community is buzzing about the new Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) project, which launched its presale in the second half of 2023 and has raised over $8.4 million so far.\n\nSome traders believe that Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s revolutionary Stake-to-Mine protocol could even allow it to outpace Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) growth once listed on centralized exchanges this year.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Seeks to Democratize BTC Mining Through Staking Model\n\nFor those unaware, Bitcoin Minetrix is an Ethereum-based project that aims to open up BTC mining to a wider audience.\n\nBy staking BTCMTX tokens in a smart contract, users can earn \u201cmining credits\u201d that can later be redeemed for cloud mining power.\n\nThis removes the need for expensive hardware and technical expertise, which has traditionally barred entry for everyday crypto users.\n\nAs Bitcoin Minetrix runs on Ethereum, all transactions are transparent and decentralized, with miners always retaining complete control of their tokens.\n\nBTCMTX staking also generates a passive income stream for token holders \u2013 with yields currently as high as 77% per year.\n\nBy combining the BTC mining yields with these staking rewards, users can potentially generate two streams of income.\n\nThis dual-income model makes Bitcoin Minetrix particularly appealing to investors seeking diversification and recurring rewards.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the project has begun to draw attention due to its unique setup, with high-profile names like Austin Hilton reviewing Bitcoin Minetrix in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix has even undergone a smart contract audit from Coinsult \u2013 further boosting trust in the platform\u2019s security.\n\nOngoing Presale Buzz Fuels $8.4 Million Funding Raise\n\nThe project is currently in the middle of a limited-time token presale to fund its ambitious roadmap.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s presale began in September 2023 and is structured across multiple stages where early participants can benefit from the lowest token prices.\n\nOver $8.4 million has already been raised \u2013 demonstrating the immense interest in Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s features.\n\nCurrently, BTCMTX tokens are on offer for $0.0128, although this price is only scheduled to last for one more day before rising slightly.\n\nOnce the presale ends, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on various exchanges, although specific names have yet to be released.\n\nThese listings will provide access to the broader crypto community and improve liquidity for those who invest during the presale.\n\nMembers of Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Telegram channel are already looking ahead to these listings, believing that the increased trading volume could drive sharp price increases.\n\nAdditionally, the validation that these listings will bring could attract risk-averse investors who prefer to purchase exchange-based cryptos rather than presale tokens.\n\nWith the current presale momentum showing no signs of slowing, many community members believe now is a prime opportunity to gain exposure to BTCMTX while the price is low.\n\nTraders Predict Bitcoin Minetrix to Outpace Ethereum in 2024\n\nGiven the massive momentum behind the presale, some traders think that Bitcoin Minetrix could be poised to outperform Ethereum over the next year.\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum has become the go-to platform for decentralized apps and Web3 projects.\n\nHowever, after years of exponential growth, ETH may struggle to maintain the same high pace in 2024.\n\nWith a market cap exceeding $300 billion, there\u2019s a belief that Ethereum lacks the room for 10x gains at this mature stage of its lifecycle.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s innovative staking and mining model presents an intriguing opportunity.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-launched project, BTCMTX offers huge upside if its ecosystem sees rapid user adoption in the coming year.\n\nThe project\u2019s Stake-to-Mine mechanism also unlocks two potential income streams for holders, with staking yields and BTC mining rewards reinforcing its value proposition.\n\nThis design could compound investors\u2019 returns over an extended period.\n\nIn many ways, Bitcoin Minetrix finds itself in a similar position to Ethereum in the late 2010s \u2013 a new project on the brink of providing a groundbreaking concept.\n\nIf even a fraction of Ethereum\u2019s explosive growth can be achieved, Bitcoin Minetrix could establish itself as a major player in the crypto market.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Over 200 wallets have lost funds after interacting with crypto bridge aggregator Bungee.\n\nThose who previously sent tokens via the bridge's Socket protocol route on Ethereum were affected.\n\nA bug in the underlying technology that powers parts of crypto bridge aggregator Bungee has just cost its users a combined $3.3 million.\n\nAt approximately 8:11 pm London time on Tuesday, over 200 wallets that had previously used Bungee\u2019s Socket route to send tokens on Ethereum began to see their funds drained from them.\n\nTayler Melvin, team hospitality lead at Socket, said in the Socket Discord server the project had \u201cexperienced a security incident which affected wallets with infinite approvals to Socket contracts.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of the stolen tokens \u2014 over $2.9 million \u2014 were converted into Ether. Smaller amounts of Polygon\u2019s Matic token, wrapped versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and MakerDAO\u2019s Dai stablecoin remain in the hacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nAfter noticing the attack, Socket, the project that manages the Bungee bridge\u2019s underlying technology, paused the smart contract that was being exploited.\n\n\u201cWhomever responsible can no longer do any further damage, we\u2019ve paused everything,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nSocket is an interoperability protocol that allows data and asset transfers across chains. Bungee is a bridge aggregator built using Socket\u2019s technology by the same team.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a long list of bridge hacks that have plagued DeFi in recent years.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPrevious approvals\n\nPseudonymous security researcher officercia told DL News that the bug had inadvertently been deployed by Socket three days prior in a new smart contract.\n\nIt allowed the hacker to target those who had previously used the Bungee bridge to send tokens from Ethereum to other blockchains.\n\nWhen bridging tokens, users often have to first sign a separate transaction allowing the bridge to spend their funds.\n\nIn the case of Socket, as well as many other DeFi protocols, this approval is often set to allow the protocol requesting it to spend a much higher amount of tokens than required for the bridging transaction.\n\nThe hacker was able to exploit these approvals to drain tokens from victims\u2019 wallets without them having to sign another transaction.\n\n\u201cThis is a good time to start a new habit \u2014 revoke approvals afterwards,\u201d officercia said.\n\nTransactions that let a DeFi protocol spend a user\u2019s funds can be revoked using websites such as revoke.cash.\n\nIf those who had granted Socket the ability to spend their funds had revoked the permissions after bridging, they would have prevented the hacker from stealing their crypto.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Surges After Spot ETF Approval - Is Ethereum Next? Presale Madness for Pullix - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Recently, Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a meteoric surge following the approval of a Spot ETF. Meanwhile, analysts claim that Ethereum (ETH) is next for this event. Adding to the excitement, the Pullix (PLX) presale has ignited a frenzy, raising over $3.6M and reaching Stage 6. Some experts even hint that PLX could become the next 100x altcoin in 2024 - let\u2019s see why.\n\nBitcoin ETF News\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has made headlines as the SEC approved all Bitcoin ETFs. This landmark approval sent Bitcoin on an upward trajectory, reaching $47,600. With this development, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has jumped 10% on the monthly charts, soaring from $41,790 on December 12 to $46,648 on January 11.\n\nThe technical analysis of this top 5 cryptocurrency paints a bullish picture as 27 technical indicators are in the green. Moreover, its Fear & Greed index rating is 76 (Extreme Greed) - a good bullish sign. Because of these circumstances, experts predict that Bitcoin may trade at the $65,341 level by the end of 2024.\n\nHow High Will Ethereum Go?\n\nMeanwhile, market analyst Will Clemente announced the next deadline for the Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Per him, May 23 is the final deadline for Van Eck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF approval. After this news, the Ethereum price increased from $2,408 on January 10 to $2,636 on January 11.\n\nSentiment around this altcoin is bullish, with 28 technical indicators flashing green. Additionally, the Ethereum cryptocurrency trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. All these factors have made market analysts make a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They foresee a potential surge to $2,832 for Ethereum by the end of February 2024.\n\nPullix (PLX): On the Top ICO List\n\nPullix (PLX) has also made headlines as it recently entered Stage 6 of its presale. Pullix aims to challenge the status quo by creating a hybrid trading platform. This exchange will combine the best features of both CEX and DEX in one place. Therefore, you can expect deep liquidity, access to all asset classes (including cryptos) and high leverage at 1000:1 on Pullix.\n\nThe PLX native token is the backbone of this platform and will be the main currency used to make trades. One exciting aspect is its \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d model, which has caused global investors to stockpile this token. To clarify, Pullix will reward PLX stakers by giving them a percentage of the exchange\u2019s daily revenue.\n\nThis passive income capability and holding perks like reduced trading fees have helped sell 4.6M PLX tokens so far. One PLX token is worth $0.08 - a 100% ROI for those who bought it early on. Thanks to its ties to the forex market, which Baby Pips claims is the biggest, experts predict a 100x surge for PLX after it hits exchanges in Q1 of 2024.\n\nCan Pullix Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nLooking at all three of these cryptos, it is clear that Pullix has one distinct advantage. It has a low market cap of $16M, while Bitcoin and Ethereum have $917B and $316B, respectively. This means PLX would only need $16M for its current price (and returns) to double. On the other hand, BTC and ETH may find it difficult to rise to new heights. For this reason, Pullix looks to be the best crypto to invest in.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

This drew the interest of Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum.\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future. Hard for me to tell from outside, but I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive\ud83e\uddbe\ud83e\uddbe \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 29, 2022\n\nAccording to Solana Foundation, there is a continual influx of professional developers joining the ecosystem, and the developer environment is progressively maturing.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n\u201cThis past year [2023], we have had a steady number of around 2500 \u2013 3000 monthly active developers building on Solana throughout the year.\n\nMoreover, throughout 2023, 3-month developer retention within the Solana ecosystem has increased from 31% to >50%, keeping more developers that join in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSolana has actively cultivated a good experience for developers by making onboarding easier and providing assistive documentation and scaffolding, making joining the ecosystem a clearer choice for developers.\n\nDespite its relatively recent establishment, with the Solana mainnet beta going live in March 2020, the developer ecosystem has rapidly expanded, positioning it as the second-largest ecosystem in terms of total monthly active developers.\n\n\u201cThrough multiple developer bootcamps that vary in focus and difficulty, there are 400 -500 senior developers graduating every 6 months with the intention of building on Solana. Data from the recent Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon shows that ~50% of the top 150 submissions and ~50% of the winners had completed one of these bootcamps.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Solana Foundation\n\nOver half of the developers entering the ecosystem possess a minimum of three years of experience, contributing to a more seasoned level of input in the development of applications on the network.\n\nThe Solana Foundation\u2019s latest hackathon, HyperDrive, witnessed the participation of representatives from 151 countries. Among them, participants from 65 countries, including Nigeria, submitted final projects for consideration.\n\n273 projects from Nigeria registered for the HyperDrive hackathon, with 41 submitting the projects while 2 are listed as winners.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________"

        "content": "The Terra Luna Classic community looks beyond the typical chain developments to a more diverse approach by enabling Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) support on the chain. It will help the community-led Terra Classic chain to become compliant with new and emerging technologies, introducing many advantages.\n\nInterestingly, the EVM support will allow Terra Luna Classic to use the Solidity programming language, mostly used on EVM chains.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTerra Luna Classic EVM Functionality\n\nProposal 11978 \u201cInvestigate EVM Functionality\u201d is under voting on the Station wallet and has already surpassed the pass threshold. The EVM will expand Terra Luna Classic use cases by bringing the programmability and composability of the EVM and sovereignty and interoperability of the Cosmos.\n\nThe proposal has received over 62% votes in favor, with 29 validators supporting the proposal. The deadline for voting is January 17.\n\n\u201cTerra Classic will have the potential to become compliant with new and emerging technologies like Optimistic transactions, where Terra Classic does not need to send direct security information on each transaction, and Rollups, which allow significantly more transactions to be processed at once, dramatically increasing the processing power of Terra Classic,\u201d said ClanMudhorn of Terrarium validator.\n\nEVM support on Terra Classic presents a strategic move toward interoperability and adoption of widely-used blockchain development standards. This can attract projects such as Curve DAO, Uniswap, ChainLink, Hedera, and others.\n\nMoreover, the limitations of inter-blockchain communication (IBC) on EVM will provide added advantage to Terra Luna Classic. The proposal outlines potential approaches, emphasizing a cautious and governance-driven decision-making process.\n\nRead More: Judge Denies Terra & Do Kwon\u2019s Request For Reconsidering Court Ruling\n\nLUNC and USTC Price Momentum Fades\n\nLUNC price jumps over 5% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.000127.

        "content": "The crypto market\u2019s attention is shifting away from the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, with most digital assets failing to capitalize on the monumental event in the short term. Based on the price movement after the approval, the product can be deemed to have turned out to be a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event.\n\nInterestingly, the conversation around crypto ETFs has turned to a possible similar product for Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThese discussions are highlighted by activities on Google Trends, where interest in the keyword \u2018Ethereum ETF\u2019 has spiked to an all-time high in the United States over the past 12 months.\n\nIn particular, data acquired by Finbold on January 15 indicates that by the week ending January 13, the interest in the keyword hit a peak popularity score of 100, the highest point over the last month. Notably, between January 6 and January 14, the interest spiked by 455%.\n\n12-month interest in \u2018Ethereum ETF\u2019 in US.

Nevada follows closely in third place with a score of 94, trailed by New Jersey at 85, while Washington secures the fifth spot with a score of 81.\n\nDrivers of ETH ETF interest\n\nInterest in the Ethereum ETF surged notably after BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) CEO Larry Fink expressed that he \u201csees value\u201d in the product. It\u2019s worth highlighting that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment management firm, is a key player in the Bitcoin ETF arena.\n\nIt is also among the applicants awaiting feedback from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the spot Ethereum ETF application. The SEC is set to decide on the Ethereum ETF in May of this year.\n\nHowever, there is speculation that the product might encounter obstacles due to its classification by regulators as a security. At the same time, SEC chair Gary Gensler has pointed out that part of the reason for approving a Bitcoin ETF is its classification as a commodity.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAmidst the speculation, Ethereum is experiencing increasing buying pressure, with the token rallying while Bitcoin faces the threat of losing the $40,000 support zone.\n\nEthereum has recorded weekly gains of over 13% as of press time, with the decentralized finance (DeFi) token trading at $2,537.\n\nEthereum seven-day price chart.

        "title": "SSV Network: Transforming Ethereum Staking with Distributed Validator Technology - Blockonomi",
        "content": "With Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, staking has become vital to securing the network. But even after the Merge, operating validator nodes still requires 32 ETH, advanced technical skills, and reliable infrastructure. This creates barriers to participation for many people.\n\nEnter SSV \u2013 an open source protocol enabling decentralized and accessible Ethereum staking built atop the post-Merge landscape.\n\nHow does Ethereum staking currently work?\n\nUnder PoS, validator nodes add new blocks rather than miners. To become a solo validator, you must lock up 32 ETH and set up nodes to do the validation work \u2013 whether on hardware you control or using a third-party service. These validators then earn rewards in the form of additional ETH proportional to their stake. However, there are significant hardware demands and the risk of penalties if your validator goes offline.\n\nThe SSV solution\n\nSSV is a staking infrastructure protocol developed by a community-driven DAO. It works by distributing validator keys among non-trusting nodes called \u201coperators\u201d. This means multiple operators can jointly run a validator without any one operator having full control.\n\nAnyone can join SSV as an operator by running an open-source node and registering keys. The protocol handles distributing validator key shares among operators automatically. Validators with 32 ETH at stake provide the keys to the network to have their ETH staked across the operator pools. This gives them effortless access to staking without infrastructure costs. Even if some operators go offline, rewards keep accruing due to the distributed nature.\n\nBenefits of the SSV model\n\nSSV unlocks Ethereum staking for regular users in a decentralized way. By splitting up infrastructure needs, it offers:\n\nReduced barriers to entry: No need for 32 ETH or to maintain validator hardware Enhanced security: Collective validation by operators, with distributed keys More decentralization: Anyone can be an operator or staker Fault tolerance: The network sustains some operator downtime Flexibility: Stakers can choose operator pools based on geography, hardware etc. Censorship resistance: Decentralized operators make collusion unlikely Community-oriented: Open source network governed by a DAO\n\nBy innovating staking infrastructure for the Web3 era, SSV helps move Ethereum towards greater decentralization and accessibility. Now anyone can play a role in shaping consensus and earning rewards.\n\nThe SSV Token\n\nSSV is the native token and has two core functions:\n\nNetwork Governance\n\nSSV holders can create and vote on proposals to steer policies, partnerships, tech upgrades, and more. Just as tokens enable on-chain governance for DeFi protocols, SSV puts the direction of the network in community hands.\n\nValidators pay fees to operators for securing and managing their staked ETH using SSV as interoperable currency. With skin in the game, SSV holders are strongly incentivized to contribute to and monitor the network\u2019s growth.\n\nPayments Between Staking Actors\n\nThe SSV token facilitates exchange of value between validators, who deposit ETH to earn staking rewards, and operators, who maintain infrastructure for validators and take a cut of yields.\n\nValidators fund their accounts with SSV, which operators draw from as a fee in proportion to the staking rewards they generate. Operators also get compensated for actions like submitting slashing proofs. This mechanic aligns incentives \u2013 the more rewards an operator enables, the more SSV they earn.\n\nBridging Incentives Through Tokens\n\nThis tokenized model is key to decentralizing staking on Ethereum in practice. By bridging incentives between essential participants, and allowing validators choice based on real-time operator performance, staking becomes open and efficient like never before.\n\nThrough clever tokenomics design, SSV is bolstering accessibility and decentralization of the rapidly evolving Ethereum network.\n\nKey Moments and Achievements\n\n2023 marked a significant chapter in the evolution of Ethereum staking, with the SSV Network pioneering a transformative approach through its permissionless mainnet deployment. Underpinning this revolutionary shift is the innovative Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) introduced by the SSV Network, which promises to enhance the security, decentralization, and robustness of Ethereum\u2019s staking ecosystem.\n\nThe SSV Foundation\u2019s creation of four testnet versions set the stage for the network\u2019s progress. Boasting 92 active operators from five continents and staking 70,000 ETH, the SSV Network exhibited impressive global participation. The launch of the Shifu testnet V2 marked a significant milestone, enabling operators to engage in Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus using DVT.\n\nETH Denver\u2019s \u2018BUIDLWeek\u2019 in February 2023 showcased the SSV Network\u2019s commitment to fostering development and creativity. With a $50 million ecosystem fund and the announcement of the Shifu testnet V2, the SSV Network provided a robust foundation for aspiring developers.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s commitment to autonomy reached new heights with the establishment the SSV DAO Verified Operators (VOs). These individuals, selected for their strong work ethic and technical expertise, were vital in overseeing a subset of the network\u2019s validators during the Limited Launch period.\n\nDecentralized Governance and Expansion\n\nWhen the Multi-Sig Committee and Quorum Proposal were first introduced in August of 2023, it was a momentous day for the SSV Network. The purpose of these suggestions, which were included in the second round of DAO projects, was to improve network security, simplify decision-making processes, and support efforts that contribute to the expansion of the network.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s governance system, combined with the Karma dashboard and Vote Delegation, significantly reduced the barriers that prevented community members from participating in decision-making processes.\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s open-source ETH staking architecture, powered by DVT, addresses critical challenges in Ethereum staking. Active-Active Redundancy and Fault Tolerance ensure uninterrupted validator operation, even in the face of node failures. The unique approach of securing ETH without custody, where validator keys are generated, split, and securely stored offline, enhances the safety of staking for users.\n\nDecentralization and Diversity are cornerstones of the SSV Network, as independent node operators globally contribute to the network\u2019s infrastructure. This strengthens the Ethereum blockchain and reduces risks for individual stakes.\n\nFlexibility and Lack of Coordination are integral to SSV Network\u2019s implementation of DVT. Stakeholders can choose validator operators without collaboration, all managed through smart contracts. The ability of distributed validators to swiftly switch nodes adds a layer of flexibility to the network.\n\nHistorical Evolution and Notable Achievements\n\nThe SSV Network\u2019s inception traces back to the team\u2019s involvement in Blox Finance in 2017, evolving into a non-custodial ETH staking provider, Blox Staking. The adoption of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s DVT technology idea in 2020 led to the creation of the SSV protocol, with the mainnet launch in 2023.\n\nFounder Alon Muroch, a leading Ethereum POS specialist, spearheaded the team\u2019s efforts, securing strategic partnerships with Coinbase, Digital Currency Group, and OKEx. Over three years, the team achieved significant milestones, including the release of the SSV protocol, DAO creation, testingnets, DAO fundraising, and a $50 million green fund.\n\nSSV Network\u2019s Impact on Ethereum Staking\n\nA revolutionary change in Ethereum staking has occurred due to the recent deployment of the permissionless mainnet made available by SSV Network. Within the framework of the staking paradigm, the employment of DVT technology answers issues about centralization. It is in line with the vision of decentralized validators that Vitalik Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, has.\n\nThrough its incentive program, which rewards users with one million SSV tokens, the SSV Network is committed to constructing a diverse ecosystem and fostering acceptance of the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result of three years of concentrated development that ended in a mainnet that does not need permission, the SSV Network has emerged as a critical player dedicated to expanding Ethereum\u2019s staking environment. This is because the mainnet does not require permission.\n\nOne year ago, the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) network presented a groundbreaking Ecosystem Fund funded with fifty million dollars.\n\nSome of the parties participating in this transaction are venture capitalists, angel investors, and staking enterprises, including DCG, OKX, HashKey, NGC, Everstake, HackVC, GSR, and Chorus. Developing stake solutions for the future generation was a collaborative effort between One SevenX and 1kx.\n\nMore Adoption Is Likely\n\nA significant number of companies use the ssv.network, and they do so by using DVT. Core Development Lead Alon Muroch places significant emphasis on expanding the number of individuals who can use Ethereum\u2019s security. It is anticipated by the DVT protocol that there would be a substantial rise due to the establishment of the Eco Fund.\n\nAfter presenting the ssv.network DAO, which allocated $3 million for developer awards, firms including Blockscape, ANKR, Stader, and Moonstake were given over $1.2 million in prizes for using DVT in product development. These companies were honored for their accomplishments.\n\nIn addition, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s concept for Ethereum 2.0 involves introducing a decentralized virtual token (DVT) to improve the system\u2019s level of security. Each validator uses DVT, made possible by ssv.network, which is positioned as Ethereum\u2019s Layer 0. Ethereum is developing toward a global decentralized and censorship-resistant network. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nTo demonstrate its dedication to decentralization, innovation, and the empowerment of communities, the SSV Network will begin on a journey that will be revolutionary in the year 2024. With rising interest in blockchain, SSV is well placed to rise along with the wider market.\n\nA paradigm shift has occurred in the Ethereum staking given by the network due to the use of DVT technology, which has improved security, fault tolerance, and flexibility. As the SSV Network continues to shape the future of distributed Ethereum staking, it is projected to have a substantial impact on the blockchain technology ecosystem.\n\nThe SSV Network is a driving force in the development of Ethereum\u2019s staking environment because of its commitment to a staking landscape that is open, decentralized, and permissionless."
