        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission today said that it will need more than 45 days to evaluate a rule change that would allow Grayscale to convert its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline is January 25, 2024.\n\nThe news comes as the regulatory body received notice from investing giant BlackRock that its pending Bitcoin spot ETF has already drawn $100,000 in seed funding from an undisclosed investor.\n\nFor Grayscale, the decision comes two weeks after the SEC delayed a separate request from the crypto asset manager to evaluate its proposal for an Ethereum futures ETF. That application was submitted in September.\n\nThe reason given in both cases was the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" reads the SEC's official notice today.\n\nThat is, word for word, the same explanation the SEC provided last month.\n\nAs for BlackRock, its amended Form S-1 registration for its iShares Bitcoin Trust includes disclosure of a \"seed capital investor\" that's affiliated with BlackRock. The unnamed investor purchased 4,000 shares at a per-share price of $25 on October 27, for total proceeds of $100,000."

        "content": "The decoupling was most likely due to an increase in spot ETH ETF launches.\n\nA lower BTC-ETH correlation made a case for portfolio diversification.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] correlation with Ethereum [ETH] dropped to multi-year lows, signaling a major divergence in the growth trajectories of the two blue-chip cryptocurrencies.\n\nBased on a 60-day rolling window, the correlation dipped to 75% in November, according to crypto market data provider Kaiko. This was a marked departure from the all-time highs (ATH) of 97% seen during the end of 2022.\n\nEthereum weakens its relationship with Bitcoin\n\nAMBCrypto spotted a vertical drop in the relationship since November. While there was no telling evidence, the decoupling seemed to be caused by an increase in spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches.\n\nThe broader market bullishness was led by excitement over likely approvals of a dozen-odd spot Bitcoin ETF applications. This led to the start of the mid-October rally and by the time the month ended, BTC had accumulated gains of 26%.\n\nHowever, ETH was slow to match this pace, finishing October with 17% gains.\n\nHowever, the announcement of spot ETH ETFs by TradFi giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity turned it around for ETH in November. The second-largest crypto bounced above the crucial barrier of $2,000 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nTo put it simply, ETH reacted more to developments in its own ecosystem rather than a trickle-down effect.\n\nIt is important to understand that both assets function very differently from each other.\n\nNotably, Ethereum is used as a platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of payment.\n\nWhat is the takeaway for investors?\n\nAs per a 21 April report by Coinbase, the lower BTC-ETH correlation makes a case for portfolio diversification, as holding both assets can result in higher returns.\n\nSmart investors spread their investments across different cryptos, reducing their exposure to any one category.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs for institutional investors, the trend could impact their trading strategies like cross-hedging. For the curious, cross-hedging is a practice of managing risk by investing in two assets that have similar price movements but are not perfectly correlated.\n\nHaving said that, traders and investors should not take these as investment advice, and instead perform their due diligence."

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said the program was used by terrorists and other U.S.-sanctioned entities, so it added Tornado's Ethereum-based computer code to the same blacklist as Iran, North Korea and Hamas. In response, some blockchain advocates were defiant; they balked at OFAC's attempt at \"censorship\" and gloated that Ethereum would be immune to it as a result of its decentralized construction."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt comments on Ethereum price action as the market embarks on a fresh crypto rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged to $44,000 for the first time since April 2022. Ethereum, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, also soared in response to the bullish impulse, touching highs of $2,312 in today's trading session.\n\nIn a new tweet, Brandt asks his 705,100 followers if Ethereum will emerge from the shadows anytime soon. He says that at least three narratives are possible, about which he launched a poll for his followers to participate in.\n\nVisual for reference pic.twitter.com/16YP1sZMQL \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 6, 2023\n\nBrandt's three narratives include a classic wedge that targets the $900 price for ETH. The second narrative is a running wedge pattern, which, if verified, has a price target of $3,300.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famed trader's third narrative is \"Morphology ahead,\" which could imply that the Ethereum price action is still brewing and in the process of taking a particular form or structure. Brandt provides a visual representation of these price patterns.\n\nThe first option, the classic wedge, received 24% of votes in favor. The amount of 60.7% of respondents voted for the more likely option of a running wedge with a target of $3,300 given the current market standing. A total of 15.3% of the respondents voted for the 'Morphology ahead' option.\n\nTypically, a wedge pattern can indicate either bullish or bearish price reversals. A rising wedge (which indicates a bearish reversal) or a descending wedge (which indicates a bullish reversal) are the two types of wedge patterns.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH had gained 2.16% in the previous 24 hours and was trading at $2,264.\n\nIn ETF-related news, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that it will take more than 45 days to review a rule change that would allow Grayscale to transform its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline has been set for Jan. 25, 2024."

        "content": "While Bitcoin Ordinals are making headlines, inscriptions on Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains have gained traction in recent weeks, according to a Dragonfly data analyst.\n\nWhile Bitcoin inscriptions continue to gain headlines and spur debates, inscriptions on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains have gained traction in the past month, particularly on the Polygon network, according to an X thread from Hildobby, a data analyst at crypto-native venture capital firm Dragonfly.\n\nGas fees spent on inscriptions peaked at about $800,000 two weeks ago before retreating, but inscriptions have remained stronger on Polygon, representing 72% of overall transactions on the chain in the past week. Hildobby attributes much of this activity to the Polygon-focused inscription marketplace POLS Market.\n\n\u201cPolygon seems to be where most inscriptions are thanks to @PolsMarket whose inscription \u201cpols\u201d has seen the most minters with ~100k addresses,\u201d Hildobby wrote.\n\n1/ Inscriptions have gained traction on EVM chains over the past month, most notably on Polygon where they account for 20% of gas spent & 72% of transactions \ud83d\udcdd more below pic.twitter.com/1s78sUqyik \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) December 6, 2023\n\nInscriptions on EVM chains work by storing small amounts of metadata in the call data for a blockchain transaction. Similarly to Bitcoin Ordinals, EVM inscriptions essentially form smart contract-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs). And, like Ordinals, EVM inscriptions have raised concerns, including about whether the technology is scalable.\n\nBut Hildobby noted that he isn\u2019t advocating for EVM chain inscriptions, tweeting, \u201cFYI: Inscriptions go against every EVM design decisions, with gas costs being the only benefit, at the expense of indexing, non-compatibility, integration challenges.\u201d"

By the 4th of December, this had grown to over $4.5 billion, representing its highest level since February 2023.\n\nRising Open Interest alongside rising prices suggested that new money was coming into the market, fueling the bullish momentum. This signaled that the upward trend was likely to continue.\n\nHowever, with price volatility making a gradual comeback, the rally might be short-lived, as traders increasingly occupied leveraged positions.\n\nETH\u2019s Bollinger Bands indicator (BB), assessed on a daily chart, confirmed the possibility of significant price swings soon. At press time, the altcoin\u2019s price traded above the upper band of this indicator.\n\nLikewise, the gap between the upper and lower bands of the BB indicator has widened consistently since the 30th of November.\n\nA gradual widening of these bands typically indicated an increase in market volatility. The coin\u2019s Bollinger Bandwidth, which has grown since then, confirmed the rising volatility.\n\nDue to the recent price surge, ETH\u2019s estimated leverage ratio has risen. This indicated that, at press time, traders were borrowing more money to trade the leading crypto asset.\n\nETH\u2019s climbing leverage ratio is often seen as a bullish signal. Notably, it suggests that traders are confident that the coin\u2019s price will continue to rise.\n\nHowever, it is also risky, as traders with high leverage are more vulnerable to liquidations if the market moves against them.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nAMBCrypto found that ETH\u2019s funding rates have been only positive since the October rally, meaning that traders have continuously opened trade positions in expectation of a price rally.\n\nHowever, with the market approaching an overheated region, a drawback might result in the liquidation of some of these positions."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's (ETH) market indicators are presenting a rare confluence of bullish signals, suggesting the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be poised for a significant price surge. There are three key data points that might become a foundation for a new rally.\n\nInstitutional pivot: ETH Futures gain traction\n\nThe first sign comes from the futures market, where ETH's performance on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is turning heads. Ethereum futures are now trading at a 5% premium compared to Bitcoin's basis, a notable shift in institutional focus.\n\nInteresting to see the futures basis for ETH on CME is now trading at a 5% premium to the basis for BTC and open interest for ETH on CME is now starting to pick up after lagging BTC.\n\n\n\nEarly signs of tradfi starting to rotate into the ETH ETF trade? pic.twitter.com/o12EXjWsmZ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) December 4, 2023\n\nMoreover, open interest in ETH on the CME has seen an uptick, starting to outpace BTC after a period of lagging. This shift could indicate growing interest from traditional finance (TradFi) investors in Ethereum, potentially as a reaction to the burgeoning ETF market for ETH.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBullish technical outlook on ETH charts\n\nThe provided price chart offers a bullish technical outlook for Ethereum. A closer analysis reveals a strong uptrend, with ETH's price action forming higher highs and higher lows \u2013 a classic indicator of bullish momentum. The moving averages have aligned in a way that typically precedes bullish conditions: the 50-day moving average is well above the 200-day moving average, and the price is currently trading above both, confirming a \"golden cross\" formation. This technical pattern often attracts further buying from momentum traders, reinforcing the positive trend.\n\nDeFi as catalyst amid BTC's potential correction\n\nLastly, the potential for a correction in Bitcoin's (BTC) price may drive investors toward Ethereum, particularly as the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector gains more traction. Ethereum is the foundational platform for DeFi applications, and as this industry grows, ETH is likely to benefit from increased utility and demand. This, combined with a possible redistribution of capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum, could provide the necessary fuel for Ethereum's price growth."

        "title": "NFT Trading Activity on Ethereum Surges, Reaching a Six-Month High - Unchained",
        "content": "NFTs are not dead, these are instead experiencing a resurgence in trading volume following a two-year low.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain are resurging, hitting their highest trading activity across all marketplaces in six months, following a recent two-year low.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume for the week ending on Monday, Dec. 4 exceeded 105,000 ETH, a more than 250% increase since the week ending on Oct. 9, Nansen data shows. A local trough in early October saw the lowest recorded level since July 2021, right before the first explosion in NFT trading.\n\nThese trends may be indicating an end to NFT winter.\n\nData\n\nfrom CoinGecko shows CryptoPunks, one of the earliest major NFT collections, have experienced an almost 45% jump in floor price over the past 30 days to 57.24 ETH. That figure remains well shy of its all-time high of 125 ETH, however.\n\nThe boom since October suggests that the \u201cmarket basically agrees that NFTs bottomed,\u201d blockchain analytics firm Parsec CEO Will Sheehan wrote to Unchained on Telegram. \u201cThe Punks rally was equivalent to a BTC rally for the NFT market. Now you see pockets of net buying in NFTs, Pudgies the most notable, but in general liquidity and attention in NFTs has inflected,\u201d said Sheehan.\n\nThe surge in NFT trading coincides with ETH rising to around $2,200, a price point that hasn\u2019t been seen since May 2022. \u201cMuch of the spike in NFT trading volume has to do with the price movement of ETH,\u201d wrote Cameron Thompson, community manager and editor for NFT gallery Tonic, in an email to Unchained. \u201cETH\u2019s 20% increase in the past month has not only driven the buying and selling of NFTs, but has also reinforced positive sentiments around tokenized collectibles \u2014 sentiments that have not been felt among the Web3 community in many months.\u201d\n\nThe majority of NFT trading volume these days takes place on Blur, the leading marketplace tailored for high-frequency traders, which launched in October 2022, with former market leader OpenSea coming in second.\n\nRenewed Interest and General Appeal Outside the Crypto Ecosystem\n\nCarlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, expressed two noteworthy reasons for the increased trading volumes for NFTs. The first is renewed interest in \u201cmeme\u201d NFTs, like Pixelmon and Milady. \u201cThese often serve as proxies for leveraged ETH, so as ETH rises the store of value narrative rises,\u201d Mercado wrote to Unchained via Telegram. In the past 30 days, the floor prices of Pixelmon and Milady have increased 210% and 48%, respectively, per CoinGecko.\n\nThe second, wrote Mercado, is the \u201cnoticeable success (led by Nouns & Pudgy Penguins) in breaking out of crypto into the broader culture.\u201d In September, Pudgy Penguins debuted its toy collection across 2,000 Walmart stores in the United States. OpenSea\u2019s Pudgy Penguins page showed that in the past 30 days, volume increased 114% to 15,770 ETH, while its number of sales jumped 58% to 2,267 and floor price grew 83% to 9.7 ETH.\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that Blur\u2019s lending smart contract holds the most Pudgy Penguins, with 477 NFTs, a roughly 9% increase in the past 24 hours. The second biggest holder of Pudgy Penguins is a smart contract associated with Flooring Protocol, which fractionalizes NFTs to lower barriers to entry for new participants.\n\nPseudonymous Blur co-founder Pacman did not return a request for comment as of press time."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that prominent gaming influencer FaZe Banks loves crypto. Now, he\u2019s buying more.\n\nRichard \"FaZe Banks\" Bengtson is the CEO and co-founder of esports organization and lifestyle brand FaZe Clan. The gamer took to Instagram this week to report his latest crypto purchases and double down on his pro-crypto stance amidst a broader gaming industry where crypto remains a controversial topic.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be my typical normie homie and call me asking for plays a year from now when the mainstream media and your mom [are] talking about crypto again,\u201d Banks urged his 2.8 million Instagram followers Tuesday along with a note of Ethereum\u2019s price reaching $2,300, a yearly high.\n\n\u201cExpose yourself now,\u201d Banks continued in a post evangelizing crypto and arguing that potential buyers should look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBTC is the safest, ETH is about as safe with slightly more upside in my opinion. My personal favorite. A large percentage of my net worth is in Ethereum,\u201d Banks wrote, adding that in his view, Solana is the \u201criskiest\u201d of the three cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cMy money is definitely where my mouth is on this one. Buy it and leave it alone. Chill,\u201d he added.\n\nLike many financial assets and purchases, though, it\u2019s important to note that buying or trading cryptocurrencies comes with risk\u2014and fans should be careful not to take financial advice from influencers or celebrities they follow online. It's often not clear what an influencers motivations may be in promoting a cryptocurrency, NFT project, or any financial asset.\n\nBanks also claimed that he recently spent $200,000 on four altcoins: Prime, Pepe, Mog, and Clouds, the last of which has not yet been officially released.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrime is the sci-fi NFT card game Parallel\u2019s official token, Pepe is a frog-inspired meme coin which recently rose to a $666 million market cap, and Mog is a meme coin that\u2019s been swirling on Twitter among fans who have paired it with memes of people and animals wearing a specific pair of colorfully-tinted glasses. Clouds is an upcoming token from the Endless Clouds crypto startup that is developing the Treeverse gaming platform.\n\n\u201cThese are the first real plays I\u2019ve made since the big market crash,\u201d Banks said, who over the summer also hopped onto the \u201cSocialFi\u201d trend and made over $70,000 by signing up for Friend.tech.\n\nBanks did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment on his latest crypto purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that FaZe Clan\u2019s newly-appointed CEO has been in crypto for years now. Back in 2021, Banks was accused of allegedly pumping and dumping an altcoin he promoted, BankSocial.\n\nAnd a quick glimpse at a wallet connected to Banks called \u201cBanksfucks\u201d currently holds some NFTs from Azuki\u2019s collections, two Bored Apes, four Mutant Ape NFTs, a staggering 72 Otherdeed NFTs for Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside metaverse game, two Clone X NFTs, and one Doodles NFT, among others. He has also recently boasted of CryptoPunks holdings.\n\nWhile Banks is a crypto and NFT enthusiast, not everyone in FaZe Clan shares this view. The org\u2019s only current female member, Kalei Renay, previously told Decrypt in an interview at TwitchCon that she isn\u2019t a fan of NFTs.\n\n\u201cAs a community, everybody hates NFTs,\u201d FaZe Kalei said of gamers. \u201cIt\u2019s your money, do whatever, but I don\u2019t care for NFTs. I don\u2019t do crypto, I don\u2019t do any of that. I stay so far away from it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Ethereum saw a modest 1.9% increase. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price jumped by 4.0%. This has pushed its market dominance to an impressive 51.3%.\n\nThis outperformance is reflective of the market's current confidence in the crypto king, which is enjoying the spotlight because of the ETF hype."

        "content": "Binance has expanded its free trading options for the spot and margin trading pairs of the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin pairing with six digital assets, including BNB, Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, according to a Dec. 5 statement.\n\nBinance users will see zero maker and taker fees for these pairs starting Dec. 8 for an undisclosed period. The exchange explained that the free trading option would exclude these pairs from BNB fee discounts, rebates, and other adjustments.\n\nHowever, the firm stated that it \u201creserves the right to disqualify trades deemed to be wash trades or illegally bulk account registrations, as well as trades that display attributes of self-dealing or market manipulation.\u201d\n\nBinance is actively pushing FDUSD.\n\nThe free transaction promotion is part of Binance\u2019s ongoing efforts to encourage its users to use the FDUSD stablecoin.\n\nLast week, the crypto platform said it would phase out support for Binance USD (BUSD) by Dec. 15. Binance urged users to convert their BUSD holdings into the new stablecoin before the end of the year, saying it would end BUSD withdrawals by Dec. 31 and that BUSD balances would be automatically converted to FDUSD.\n\nBinance\u2019s decision relates to the BUSD stablecoin\u2019s regulatory issues. Earlier in the year, the BUSD issuer, Paxos, suspended the stablecoin issuance following scrutiny from U.S. regulators. At the time, the company received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which classified the stablecoin as a security.\n\nWhile Binance and Paxos have vehemently rejected this classification, the crypto community promptly deserted the stablecoin, with its circulating supply dropping to less than $2 billion as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nConcurrently, Binance has been heavily pushing FDUSD as a viable alternative, introducing new products for the digital asset and incentivizing its use. However, FDUSD\u2019s circulating supply remains less than 1 billion and is only available on less than five crypto exchanges.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "With Bitcoin mining stocks surging, analysts and even legacy banks like JPMorgan Chase are increasingly bullish on the sector\u2019s prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum-based project Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is nearing $5 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), thanks to the buzz around its innovative Stake-to-Mine model.\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Sector \u2013 A Brief Overview\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using specialized computers to solve complex math problems that validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn return, miners earn BTC as a reward \u2013 providing an incentive to continue mining.\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s early days, mining was possible on regular home computers.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin network has grown, mining has become increasingly competitive, spurring an arms race in mining hardware development.\n\nThe introduction of ASIC mining rigs has enabled industrial-scale Bitcoin mining operations, helping the mining sector balloon to a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by large firms.\n\nAlthough the sector\u2019s energy consumption has raised environmental concerns, recent innovations have begun to focus on boosting efficiency in a greener way.\n\nMoreover, these concerns have led to the exploration of alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power in BTC mining operations.\n\nAccording to a report from Industry Research Co., the entire crypto-mining market was valued at $4.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2028.\n\nAnalysts & JPMorgan Bullish on Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nSeveral analysts, and even huge financial institutions like JPMorgan, are growing increasingly optimistic about the prospects of companies that operate in the crypto mining space.\n\nCleanSpark ($CLSK), in particular, has attracted bullish praise recently.\n\nIn a recent research note, JPMorgan called CleanSpark its \u201ctop pick\u201d among mining stocks, citing its \u201cscale, growth potential, power costs & relative value.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, crypto analyst UltraXBT expressed confidence in CleanSpark at current levels, claiming it\u2019s a \u201c$25 stock that is currently identifying as a $4.50 stock.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ThoughtfulTrade on Twitter noted that a Bitcoin breakout above $46,000 could spur the price of mining stocks like CleanSpark to soar even higher.\n\nWith BTC mining profitability improving due to the crypto market\u2019s recovery, firms like CleanSpark that leverage low-cost power stand to capitalize.\n\nMoreover, the upbeat outlook from JPMorgan and analysts reflects the growing optimism around the Bitcoin mining space in general.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Platform Introduces Innovative Stake-to-Mine Model & Raises $4.8 Million\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining stocks like CleanSpark offer indirect exposure to crypto prices, a new altcoin project called Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) aims to reinvent mining rewards through staking.\n\nThe Ethereum-based Stake-to-Mine protocol allows users to earn regular BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than purchasing expensive hardware.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s protocol works by distributing \u201cmining credits\u201d to those who stake BTCMTX, which can be exchanged for cloud mining power.\n\nIn turn, this democratizes access to BTC mining by lowering the barriers to entry \u2013 meaning anyone can get involved.\n\nThe Stake-to-Mine mechanism also enables considerable staking yields, with current APYs exceeding 120%.\n\nUltimately, by reinventing mining rewards and making hash power more accessible, Bitcoin Minetrix has the potential to transform the crypto-mining space.\n\nOn the back of strong interest surrounding its unique value proposition, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team recently launched a presale for BTCMTX.\n\nThe presale aims to raise funds to develop and scale the Stake-to-Mine platform further.\n\nMore than $4.8 million has already been raised from eager investors, with BTCMTX tokens available to buy for $0.012 each.\n\nOnce the presale concludes, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on leading centralized exchanges, enabling seamless trading for speculative investors.\n\nWith strong presale momentum and backing from high-profile names like VoskCoin, BTCMTX seems poised to make a splash when public trading begins.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Pullix (PLX), Which Has The Best Utility? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The crypto market is heating up as altcoins are taking turns to pump. Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), and Pullix (PLX) are currently being discussed as the next big cryptocurrencies to experience a surge in value. While the former two have been around for a while, Pullix is a new player set to change the trading game. But which among these three alts has the best utility for investors and traders?\n\nPLX Token: Integrating Utility with Pullix\u2019s Trading Innovation\n\nPullix is building a decentralized trading exchange that promises to tackle the common issues experienced by traders, such as high fees, lack of transparency, and slow transaction speeds. The platform will utilize blockchain technology to provide all traders with a secure and decentralized environment.\n\nBlockchain technology enables Pullix to have a transparent and auditable trading system, eliminating the need for middlemen and reducing transaction fees. It also allows users to trade anonymously across all markets, providing traders maximum security and privacy.\n\nPullix directly links its native cryptocurrency to the trading platform\u2019s performance and offers tangible benefits to its users. For example, PLX token holders receive regular passive income payments, access to exclusive rewards, and other benefits depending on the staked amount.\n\nThe token burn mechanism for Pullix\u2019s PLX token aims to stabilize and potentially increase the token\u2019s value. This is achieved by allocating a portion of the platform\u2019s daily profits to purchase and permanently remove (burn) 50% of these tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply.\n\nThe remaining 50% rewards users for staking their PLX, incentivizing long-term holding and active participation in the Pullix ecosystem. This deflationary approach is designed to align the platform\u2019s interests with those of its users and investors.\n\nThis innovative approach makes the PLX token not just a medium of exchange but a key player in the Pullix ecosystem. As Pullix\u2019s trading platform gains popularity, the value of PLX is expected to increase, making it an attractive investment for traders.\n\nAnd with Pullix at the start of its journey, investors can get in early and reap the benefits as the platform gains momentum. Someare already recognizing this opportunity and snapping up PLX tokens for $0.04 before the price rises in subsequent stages.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The Backbone of Decentralized Applications\n\nEthereum (ETH) has surged from $1,500 to $2,245 in under a month as investors continue to show confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. The $2,100 price mark has acted as resistance since May 2022, and traders expect a huge pump once this level is breached.\n\nEthereum is the cryptocurrency with the most utility in the market. It is not only a store of value but also the foundation for various decentralized applications (DApps). There are lending platforms, games, and even decentralized exchanges built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum faces competition from the likes of Solana and Radix, which offer lower fees and faster speeds. The upcoming EIP-4844 procotol upgrade is expected to solve the scalability issue, helping Ethereum maintain its dominance as the number one platform for DApps.\n\nInstitutional investors are now taking notice of Ethereum, with spot Ethereum ETF applications sent to the SEC for approval. Should these be approved, we could see an influx of institutional funds into the market, leading Ethereum to the coveted $10,000 price point.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\u2019s Potential New Use Case\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) took the crypto world by storm in early 2021 as Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man \u2014 tweeted favorably about the memecoin. While Dogecoin has no real utility, it has a strong community, making it a popular choice for sending low-cost transactions.\n\nHowever, Dogecoin may soon have another use case \u2014 as an accepted currency on X (Twitter) for tipping. Elon Musk still has the Dogecoin logo in his Twitter bio and hinted that this integration could be coming soon.\n\nAstrobotic\u2019s Peregrine Mission One is set to carry a physical Dogecoin token to the moon, marking a symbolic journey for Dogecoin. This move could garner more attention from mainstream media and potentially lead to retail investors flocking to buy Dogecoin as FOMO sets in.\n\nThe Dogecoin chart shows that there have been numerous attempts to break the $0.10 \u2013 $0.11 resistance area. A successful close above this level can open up room for further upsides, potentially seeing Dogecoin reach $0.20 during Q1 of 2024.\n\nFor more information about Pullix, visit the links below:\n\nSite: https://pullix.io/\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/pullixmarkets\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Ether vs Ethereum: The Key Behind Crypto Development - INDODAX",
        "content": "In discussions about the world of crypto assets, the role of Ether (ETH) and blockchain platform, Ethereum is very important and needs to be understood. Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that executes computer programs known as smart contracts.\n\nIt has a native crypto asset called Ether (ETH), which is the crypto asset with the second largest market capitalization after Bitcoin. However, Ether is a crypto asset and a \u201cgas fee,\u201d enabling various decentralized transactions and applications or Decentralized Applications (dApps) to operate within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs a blockchain platform, Ethereum is known to have created the foundation for major innovation in the crypto world. By understanding the differences and relationships between Ether and Ethereum, we can avoid any misunderstandings that may arise. This means that Ether is not just a digital coin but also a key element that drives the economy on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSo, to understand what Ether (ETH) is, its role in the Ethereum ecosystem, the relationship between the two, and the latest trends and future projections for Ether, see the complete review below!\n\nWhat is Ether (ETH)?\n\nIt is important to know that the Ethereum blockchain is one of the oldest and most widely used blockchain networks. Ether, which functions as a gas fee, has become one of the leading cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin in terms of market value.\n\nAs explained at the beginning of this article, Ether is a native coin or native asset used in the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate transactions throughout its ecosystem. Every transaction in the Ethereum ecosystem requires payment of a computing fee (gas fee) to the miners who carry out the transaction computation. This payment is made using Ether.\n\nThese gas fees increase with the computational complexity required. For example, the shipping costs of ERC-20 tokens are higher than sending ETH because sending ERC-20 tokens uses interaction and computing on smart contracts while sending ETH does not involve such a process.\n\nETH has various uses as a digital asset and for carrying out various transactions in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Please note that Ethereum has become one of the most widely used blockchain platforms for building dApps, along with its ability to support more programs than Bitcoin.\n\nAs a crypto asset, ETH has an important role as gas fees are paid to run computations on various applications developed on the Ethereum platform. This makes ETH one of the second largest crypto assets after Bitcoin when viewed from market value.\n\nWhen it was first traded, the value of one Ethereum coin was around $2.83 or around IDR 41,035. However, in June 2021, the price of ETH jumped to $2,578 per coin, or the equivalent of IDR 36,822,218. ETH\u2019s highest price peak occurred in November 2021, reaching $4,620. However, in December 2022, the price of Ethereum will decrease to $1,225 per coin, or the equivalent of IDR 19,264,748.\n\nSo, if you are interested in buying ETH, you can purchase through a trusted crypto buying and selling application, namely INDODAX. As a platform, INDODAX has been officially registered as a Physical Crypto Asset Trader under the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (BAPPEBTI) so that security is guaranteed. You can download the INDODAX application to buy ETH.\n\nThe Role of Ether in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIt is important to understand that Ether (ETH) is important in the Ethereum ecosystem and is used for various purposes on the network. One of Ether\u2019s main roles in the Ethereum ecosystem is as a digital asset.\n\nInitially, Ether was created as a digital asset for use on the Ethereum network. Most transactions and smart contracts are carried out using Ether. In this case, users can send and receive Ether within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEther\u2019s other main role is to pay transaction fees. Every time someone sends Ether or performs a function within a smart contract, they have to pay a transaction fee. These fees are known as \u201cgas,\u201d which is necessary to ensure that the Ethereum network runs efficiently and prevents network abuse.\n\nThe gas is a unit of measurement for measuring how much computing power is needed to complete a task on the Ethereum network. Smart contract transactions/execution require gas, and transaction fees are calculated based on the amount of gas used.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether also plays an important role in maintaining network security. Miners who process transactions and secure the network will receive rewards in the form of Ether for their efforts. This also provides incentives for miners to maintain network reliability and security.\n\nApart from that, Ether is also used as a store of value in the network\u2019s decision-making process to create tokens and to run smart contracts on the Ethereum network. For example, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens are often created using Ether as \u201cgas\u201d to carry out smart contracts.\n\nEthereum Ecosystem: Beyond Ether\n\nAs previously explained, smart contract technology on Ethereum drives new innovations in financial transactions. The following are several examples of smart contract implementation that are currently underway including:\n\n1. Stablecoins\n\nCrypto asset prices are often very volatile. Stablecoins , which utilizes smart contract technology, also solves this problem. The value of stablecoins is held to the value of non-digital assets, such as the rupiah and US dollar, to maintain their stability.\n\nSome well-known stablecoins maintain stability by guaranteeing a 1:1 rate with the original currency and being convertible to that currency. For example, Rupiah Token (IDRT), a crypto asset on the Ethereum blockchain, has a value equivalent to the rupiah. IDRT creates a digital representation of rupiah by generating tokens in proportion to the amount of rupiah deposited by the user and sending them to the user\u2019s Ethereum wallet.\n\nApart from IDRT, another example of a stablecoin, namely USD Coin (USDC), is designed to have the same value as the US dollar. The existence of stablecoins makes it easier for users to transfer value to various places around the world in a short time. Stablecoins also provide the stability needed in the crypto ecosystem and connect traditional financial infrastructure with the blockchain world.\n\n2. Borrow and Borrow on Ethereum\n\nSmart contract technology on the Ethereum blockchain also enables the development of crypto asset lending and lending applications. For example, AAVE and Compound are decentralized lending and lending Apps (dApps) based in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith AAVE and Compound, users can deposit crypto assets to earn interest or borrow other crypto assets. Using these two applications requires an Ethereum wallet and a certain amount of funds in the form of ETH or ERC-20 tokens. With AAVE and Compound, anyone can be involved in asset lending and lending activities without relying on banks or traditional financial institutions.\n\n3. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are applications that facilitate token exchange using smart contract technology. One example of a very popular DEX built on Ethereum is Uniswap and Sushiswap.\n\nThrough DEXs, users can exchange ETH for ERC-20 tokens or vice versa and exchange between ERC-20 tokens. As long as it follows the ERC-20 token standard, various types of tokens can be exchanged using DEXs.\n\nThe Connection Between the Two\n\nEther (ETH) and Ethereum are interrelated concepts, but they have different roles in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain platform allowing developers to create and run dApps. On the other hand, Ether is a crypto asset used on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember that Ethereum is designed to support smart contracts, programming codes that can execute certain tasks when specified conditions are met. Ether is used as \u201cgas\u201d to carry out these operations, including executing smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is also used as an incentive for miners (or validators in the context of Ethereum 2.0), which helps keep the network decentralized and secure. Miners will receive Ether in exchange for adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nEther is also used as a digital asset to carry out transactions within the Ethereum network. Every time someone sends Ether, it automatically reflects a transfer of value within the Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, when someone runs or interacts with smart contracts, he must pay transaction fees in the form of Ether. This helps prevent network abuse and ensures that people who use network resources pay for that use.\n\nEthereum and Ether complement each other. Ether itself is essential to maintaining the functionality of the Ethereum network. Without Ether, executing transactions, implementing smart contracts, or ensuring network security would be impossible. The existence of Ether itself supports the Ethereum ecosystem by providing incentives for developers to create decentralized applications and for miners (validators) to keep the network safe and decentralized.\n\nHistory and Evolution\n\nThe history of Ether and Ethereum is known to have reflected a long journey towards the development of blockchain technology and the growth of the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Referring to its history, Ethereum was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. It was an evolution of the idea to expand Bitcoin\u2019s functionality by enabling smart contracts.\n\nThe funding for Ethereum development was obtained through an initial public offering (ICO) in 2014, where Ether (ETH) was first sold to investors. Furthermore, Ethereum was launched on July 30, 2015, with the launch of the first block, or \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d\n\nAs time passes, Ethereum 2.0 aims to move away from consensus Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which began to be developed to increase network scalability and efficiency. The first phases of Ethereum 2.0 are launched, and the transition towards PoS begins.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Ethereum as a new blockchain platform and raising funds through ICOs is known to have played an important role in forming the modern crypto ecosystem. One of the important events that shaped their role in the crypto industry was when an attack occurred on Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO). In 2016, an attack on the DAO on Ethereum led to a massive theft of Ether.\n\nTo overcome the consequences of the DAO attack, the Ethereum community decided to carry out a hard fork, then created Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate blockchain chains. Ultimately, efforts to improve network performance and security through Ethereum 2.0 and the transition to PoS are important steps in Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\n\nThe Importance of Maintaining Both\n\nIt should be emphasized that Ether is the driving force in the Ethereum ecosystem. By maintaining its sustainability, Ether continues to support the execution of transactions and smart contracts on the network. This is important for maintaining blockchain functionality and allowing various decentralized applications to run. Apart from that, Ether also plays an important role in maintaining the resilience of the Ethereum network. Through incentives for miners (or validators in Ethereum 2.0), Ether ensures that the network remains secure, distributed, and resistant to attacks.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum powered by Ether also plays a key role in driving innovation in Decentralized Finance(DeFi). Ether\u2019s sustainability supports liquidity, collateral, and smart contract functionality that is the foundation for various DeFi projects, from loans to exchanges to other protocols.\n\nEthereum, which can run smart contracts, is known to have paved the way for various use cases, including finance, logistics, digital identity, and many others. Therefore, maintaining Ether is key to ensuring that innovation continues to develop in various sectors. On the other hand, Ethereum has also become the main platform for DeFi projects. The growth of DeFi is also one of the main factors driving wider crypto adoption, as it provides a decentralized alternative to traditional financial services.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Ether and Ethereum play an important role in forming and maintaining the crypto ecosystem. Ether\u2019s sustainability supports transactions, network security, and innovation within Ethereum, while Ethereum, as a platform, continues to drive the growth and broader adoption of blockchain technology. Both are interdependent and play an important role in driving the evolution of the global crypto ecosystem.\n\nRecent Trends and Future Projections\n\nThe latest trends in Ether and Ethereum can be seen from the development of Ethereum 2.0 and PoS. Development of Ethereum 2.0 itself continues, with a focus on implementing PoS to increase network efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, the DeFi sector continues to be a major trend within the Ethereum ecosystem, with the growth of projects such as lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity mining.\n\nThen, there are also Layer-2 scalability solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, which gained popularity to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges, enabling faster transactions and lower fees. Meanwhile, regarding future projections for Ether and Ethereum, with the continued development of Ethereum 2.0, future projections involve a swap from PoW to PoS, which is expected to increase network speed and efficiency.\n\nOn the other hand, the DeFi sector is also expected to continue to develop with more innovations, such as introducing more complex financial products, growing lending and borrowing protocols, and cross-chain solutions to increase interoperability. Ultimately, if Ethereum 2.0 successfully addresses scalability and transaction cost issues, then Ethereum will have the potential to play a role in revitalizing the global financial system, opening the door to greater financial inclusion and decentralized financial solutions.\n\nIntegrating blockchain and smart contracts on Ethereum could also bring major benefits to various industries, from supply chains to insurance, with the potential to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency.\n\nBuy Ethereum on INDODAX\n\nSo, now you understand what Ether (ETH) is, its role in the Ethereum ecosystem, the relationship between the two, and the latest trends and future projections for Ether.\n\nNext, if you want to buy Ethereum (ETH), you can do it at INDODAX. The following is a guide to buying Ethereum on INDODAX that you need to know:\n\nFirst, log in to your INDODAX account.\n\nThen, make a deposit (if the balance is still empty).\n\nContinue by visiting the INDODAX market, then search for Ethereum on the INDODAX market.\n\nNext, look for the trade column and enter the desired Ethereum price and balance amount. You can use the Instant method or the Limit method.\n\nAlternatively, you can immediately place a sell order at the price you determine after you have Ethereum. Make sure that the price is profitable.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ether functions as a digital asset within the Ethereum network, allowing transactions and payment of network operational fees (gas). In addition, Ether also provides incentives for miners (or validators) to keep the network secure via PoW or PoS.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum provides a platform for running smart contracts that allow the creation and execution of programming code without third-party intermediation. Ethereum is the basis for a growing DeFi ecosystem and various dApps that create decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services.\n\nUnderstanding Ether and Ethereum is important to understand the functionality and usability of the crypto ecosystem. A deep understanding of Ether and Ethereum is necessary to participate effectively in the crypto ecosystem and recognize the transformational potential they can bring to various sectors and industries in the future."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in the UK - Luxury Lifestyle Magazine",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has become hot property in the UK over recent years, with everyone from seasoned professionals to complete amateurs seeking to dip their toes into the waters of trading. Despite their market\u2019s characteristic volatility, they have become seen as a means to an end by those looking to build their wealth and diversify their investment portfolios, and it is in fact because of their dramatic price swings that they have become so highly sought-after. In the early days of cryptocurrencies, the world\u2019s flagship digital asset, Bitcoin, made numerous overnight millionaires during its meteoric rise from obscurity to prominence, and since then, we\u2019ve seen plenty of other investors build millions by trading Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s Ether, and other popular.\n\nWhilst these days it couldn\u2019t be easier to convert 1 ETH to USD or Bitcoin to British pounds sterling, as the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment becomes more widespread, it\u2019s becoming more appealing than ever to retain crypto fortunes in their original format. It\u2019s now possible to pay for high-end hotels and holidays, luxury cars and even homes using crypto wallets, which is a sign that cryptocurrency is well and truly here to stay.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to begin your trading journey and start amassing some digital coins with the hopes of building long-term wealth, then here\u2019s how you can buy Bitcoin, Ether and other alt coins of note in the UK.\n\nIs it legal to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the UK?\n\nThe good news is that although some countries do have restrictions on buying cryptocurrencies, in the UK, it\u2019s perfectly legal to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other comparable digital coins, and there\u2019s a well-defined regulatory framework in place. This does mean that like all other income, cryptocurrencies are legally considered to be taxable assets, which means holders must report their assets and pay their dues to His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) each year to ensure full compliance.\n\nCryptocurrency has become hot property in the UK over recent years, with everyone from seasoned professionals to complete amateurs seeking to dip their toes into the waters of trading\n\nCryptocurrencies aren\u2019t, however, recognised as legal tender in the UK in the way that the British pound is.\n\nWhy you need a crypto wallet\n\nOne of the crucial measures to put in place before you delve into investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum is to ensure you have an account set up with a crypto exchange, and a secure crypto wallet ready to go. When starting out, there\u2019s nothing wrong with leaving small amounts as holdings on your account, once you start to amass larger amounts of tokens you\u2019ll want to ensure you have somewhere safe to store them. A cold crypto wallet will give you more control over your funds and full autonomy when it comes to controlling them by safeguarding the private keys needed to access it and to authorise transactions.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the UK\n\nOne of the easiest ways to purchase cryptocurrencies in the UK is via a crypto exchange, but with such a wide variety to choose from, it\u2019s wise to shop around first. Exchanges operate without formal regulation, but registration is required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), so be sure to choose an exchange that plays by the rules as there are still some that don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that not all exchanges will offer all cryptocurrencies, so check that yours has Bitcoin and Ether available to purchase before signing up. You\u2019ll also want to ensure that there\u2019s substantial daily trading volume in these to make your own trading transactions easier, and be sure to take any fees into account, as these can affect your returns.\n\nAnother option is to go with a broker like Kraken, which offers a user-friendly interface and makes the trading process simpler, which is great if you\u2019re just starting out. Some also offer the chance to try out some moves via a dummy account before you start making real time trades, which can be a handy way to learn the ropes and gain a thorough understanding of how the market works before risking real capital.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to purchase cryptocurrencies in the UK is via a crypto exchange, but with such a wide variety to choose from, it\u2019s wise to shop around first\n\nIf, however, you\u2019re keen to keep your accumulated crypto funds in a cold crypto wallet, which is offline, brokers do not always allow this, so it\u2019s something to bear in mind when deciding whether to go with a broker or an exchange.\n\nPlacing your first order\n\nThere are various ways to fund your brokerage or exchange account so that you can start buying crypto. One of the easiest ways is by linking your bank account, but you can also make payments via debit or credit card. You\u2019ll need to submit an identification document before you\u2019re able to trade, which can mean that you\u2019re not able to make your first purchase immediately, but verification rarely takes more than a couple of days.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to go, you can place an order for Bitcoin or Ether by entering the desired amount in pounds, and you\u2019ll then be able to see how much of your desired asset you can get for your money \u2013 which will often be fractional shares of large cryptocurrencies like these if you\u2019re starting small. Next, all you need to do is click the \u2018buy\u2019 button and you\u2019re off the starting block, and ready to begin your investing journey.\n\nDisclaimer: Investing money carries risk, do so at your own risk and we advise people to never invest more money than they can afford to lose and to seek professional advice before doing so."

        "title": "Bloomberg Experts Forecast Timeline For Spot Ethereum ETF Approval - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The journey towards the approval of an Ethereum ETF in the United States has seen a new development yesterday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a delay in the decision for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum trust conversion into a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The SEC has stated the need for an extended period to evaluate the proposed rule change, pushing the new deadline Grayscale to January 25, 2024.\n\nIn its reasoning, the SEC has reiterated, \u201cThe commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d Notably, the delay comes at a time where the US agency is working with now 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applicants on presumably the final amendments before a January 10 approval.\n\nTimeline For A Spot Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nDespite the latest delay, the crypto community remains optimistic about the future of spot Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart has suggested that delays are par for the course, tweeting, \u201cUpdate: As expected Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum trust filing just got delayed. It was due by 12/6/23 so this is completely normal.\u201d\n\nSeyffart also shared a table of all seven spot Ethereum ETF applicants: VanEck, 21Shares & ARK, Hashdex, Grayscale, Invesco & Galaxy, BlackRock, Fidelity and their deadlines. He further hinted at potential approvals by mid-2024, responding to criticisms from Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, with \u201cUnfortunately I think you\u2019re gonna be really upset by June of next year.\u201d\n\nIn response to queries about the probability of an Ethereum ETF approval following a Bitcoin ETF, Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has indicated that the first filers, Ark and VanEck, have strong odds of approval by their final deadline on May 23, 2024, as they are expected to use the same mechanics as spot Bitcoin ETFs, and due to the fact that Ether futures have already received the green light from the US SEC.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nQueried about for the odd of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, he remarked, \u201cNot formally yet, but final deadline for the first filers Ark and VanEck is May 23rd so strong odds they approved by then given they\u2019d be using same design as btc etfs and ether futures were Ok\u2019d.\u201d\n\nThe Next Deadlines\n\nThe table by Seyffart shows that the next Ethereum ETF deadlines are from December 23 to 26 for VanEck, Ark Invest and Invesco & Galaxy, followed by Hashdex on January 1. Since a spot Bitcoin ETF is very unlikely to be approved by then, delays by the SEC are more than likely for this batch of filings.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBoth iShares by BlackRock and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund have their next deadlines on January 25 and January 21, 2024 respectively. These dates are crucial as they could involve either an extension, a request for more information, or a final decision.\n\nBut things only get really tense towards the final deadlines for all Ethereum ETF filers, as outlined by both Bloomberg ETF experts. With VanEck poised for May 23, 2024, and ARK Invest for May 24, 2024 and other notable filers like Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust Conversion (ETHE) scheduled for decisions by May 30, 2024, and June 18, 2024, respectively, the timeline for potential approvals is taking shape.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,271.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) reached its yearly high of $2,310 per token on December 6. Amidst this surge, institutional giants deposited 19,822 ETH ($45.2 million) to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nNotably, Galaxy Digital, Celsius, and FTX have signaled their intention to sell a relevant part of their stacks. SpotOnChain gathered this data from known crypto wallet addresses of these giant institutional investors.\n\nMoreover, Celsius and FTX have been constantly selling Ethereum and other tokens in 2023. Both companies filed for bankruptcy during the cryptocurrency bear market, which demanded these liquidations.\n\nHowever, Galaxy Digital is still operational under Mike Novogratz\u2019s leadership. Novogratz became known for his support of the collapsed Terra (LUNA) and a remarkable LUNA body tattoo.\n\nInstitutional Giants\u2019 ETH activity\n\nGalaxy Digital made three separate transactions, depositing 9,179 ETH to Binance at an average rate of $2,278, resulting in $20.9 million moved. Despite this sizable transfer, Galaxy Digital\u2019s wallets continue to hold 10,038 ETH, valued at approximately $22.8 million.\n\nGalaxy Digital on-chain portfolio. Source: SpotOnChain\n\nCelsius Network\u2019s activity was also notable, as it transferred 7,500 ETH at $2,273 each to a Coinbase intermediate address identified as 0xc45, cumulating $17.05 million.\n\nSince November 14, Celsius has moved a total of 44,769 ETH, tallying up to $94.7 million. Of this total, 37,269 ETH have already reached platforms, including Coinbase, FalconX, and OKX, averaging a transfer price of $2,084, amounting to $77.6 million.\n\nFinally, FTX, shifting 3,143 ETH to Coinbase priced at $2,294 each, accounted for $7.21 million of the collective outflow. Cumulatively, FTX and associated entity Alameda Research have moved assets worth $573 million to exchanges since October 24, 2023, including 28,427 ETH with a value of $54.3 million.\n\nThese movements from key giant institutional investors to crypto exchanges may imply a readiness to sell. Essentially, this could potentially exert downward pressure on Ethereum\u2018s market value.\n\nInterestingly, the timing coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s one-year high suggests that these institutions are seeking to capitalize on the recent price spike."

        "content": "Ita\u00fa Unibanco, the largest private bank in Brazil, has launched its crypto trading service to provide its clients with additional trading options, as reported by Reuters on December 4,\n\nGuto Antunes, Head of Digital Assets at Ita\u00fa, said that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be the initial offerings. The bank also plans to add more crypto assets in the future in compliance with the country\u2019s regulatory requirements.\n\nKeypoints\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco, Brazil\u2019s largest private bank, has launched a crypto trading service for Bitcoin and Ethereum. More assets may be added later.\n\nAs a custodian, Ita\u00fa will hold and safekeep customers\u2019 crypto assets. Customers can\u2019t yet deposit/withdraw to external wallets.\n\nIta\u00fa has partnered with other major Brazilian banks on a central bank digital currency initiative called Drex.\n\nCrypto adoption is surging across Latin America, with Brazil as a top global crypto market. This is attracting companies like OKX to expand locally.\n\nBanks globally are exploring tokenization to improve efficiencies. JPMorgan\u2019s JPM Coin processes $1 billion in bank transactions daily, with expectations to reach $10 billion soon.\n\nBrazil Is A Massive Crypto Market\n\nAs a custodian agency, Ita\u00fa Unibanco provides the holding and safekeeping of customers\u2019 crypto assets, in addition to offering exposures to crypto trading. Antunes alternatively noted that customers can\u2019t deposit and withdraw assets to an external wallet at the initial phase.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that when you keep your money in the bank account, you will have the guarantee of Itau\u2019s balance sheet as security for the amounts invested,\u201d Antunes added.\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco has reportedly joined forces with other major institutions like BTG Pactual and Santander Brasil, to facilitate the national digital currency initiative Drex. Established in 2020 and officially launched in 2023, Drex is Brazilian central bank\u2019s project to explore the feasibility of central bank digital currency (CBCD).\n\nOther banks in Brazil like BTG Pactual and Nubank previously introduced their trading platforms that allow customers to diversify their portfolio. Nubank now offers 14 crypto options on its Nubank Cripto platform. The bank had also issued its own token Nucoin to foster loyalty programs and streamline client\u2019s access to digital assets.\n\nLike Nubank, BTG Pactual launched its crypto trading platform Mynt in late 2022. The bank initially focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum with future plans to release additional options for customers.\n\nCrypto adoption is one of the largest trends in Latin America, with Brazil leading the wave. As a top global crypto market, the country has attracted a number of industry figures to expand their local operations, including OKX.\n\nIn November, the crypto firm announced the launch of its crypto exchange integrated with Web3 wallet with exclusive focus on the Brazilian market. There may be more developments coming from the market.\n\nBanks Gear Toward Tokenization\n\nTokenization has become a hot trend among financial and banking institutions. Tokenization can streamline various financial processes, such as payments, settlements, and trade finance.\n\nBanks can potentially reduce the need for intermediaries, minimize transaction times, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The transparency of blockchain technology also contributes to reducing fraud and errors.\n\nJPMorgan announced last week its bank-backed token JPM Coin would be ready for interbank transactions. The blockchain token recently debuted on Partior, a multi-bank system backed by JPMorgan, DBS Bank, Temasek and Standard Chartered. Partior aims to enable quick multi-currency transactions across its members.\n\nAlthough the Singapore-based project is already operational, details about its inner workings and usage numbers remain unclear. According to Ledger Insights, DBS Bank is active on the platform, but other banks have yet to adopt it.\n\nJPMorgan secured a major position, surpassing other US-based banks that still need permission to deploy this solution. This came after the bank received a no-objection letter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for Partior\u2019s use case in May.\n\nThe inclusion of JPM Coin in Partior could potentially boost usage, given the scale and significance of JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain token, which has a near-ubiquitous presence in banking markets. In October, Takis Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan\u2019s Global Head of Payments, announced that the token was facilitating transactions worth $1 billion per day.\n\nIn November, Umar Farooq, JPMorgan\u2019s Head of Global Financial Institutions Payments, expressed expectations of these numbers soaring. He claimed that the network could achieve $10 billion in daily transactions within the next year or two."
