        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin are holding us back - Blockworks",
        "content": "The year is 2024, and the fast-paced realm of crypto shows no signs of slowing. Innovation is the name of the game, and monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin still reign supreme.\n\nBut as someone who\u2019s been knee-deep in the trenches of blockchain development, I can\u2019t help but wonder if these behemoths are really cutting it anymore. Herein lies my thesis:\n\nModular blockchains are the disruptors poised to revolutionize scalability and creativity towards the next Cambrian explosion of Web3 products as we know them.\n\nAs engineers and product developers, it\u2019s time to embrace specialized tools for specialized tasks and leave the one-size-fits-all approach behind. This isn\u2019t to say that prior layer-1s haven\u2019t paved the way for some incredible innovations, but attempting to scale legacy layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin has proven inefficient and counterproductive. They\u2019re dragging us down, like trying to sprint through quicksand.\n\nBlockchain researchers have grappled with the challenge of creating the optimal system for years. Many architectures attempted to accommodate all users on a single chain or a tightly coupled group of chains. Yet, scaling such systems for billions of users is complex and limited. We\u2019ve thrown everything and the kitchen sink at it with solutions like sharding and layer-2 blockchains to provide additional scaling methods.\n\nDespite this, most efforts still fall somewhat short in addressing all fundamental scalability issues. As a result of these failings, and perhaps in response to them, modular blockchains are strutting onto the scene as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Prime yourself and think, \u201cmore legos.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of modular blockchains\n\nThink of modular blockchains like the Swiss Army Knife of blockchain development.\n\nThese chains break down the blockchain into modular components, specializing in specific tasks at the core of a blockchain\u2019s architecture: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability. By distributing tasks across multiple specialized layers, modular blockchains can, in theory, achieve greater scalability, customizability and security at a faster pace. When you distribute the workload like that, magic happens \u2014 so why waddle about in intellectual exercises of scaling bloated layer-1s?\n\nAt the core of modular blockchain architecture lies a layered approach that\u2019s as elegant as it is efficient. The old heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the foundational layer of the crypto economy and hold down the fort with their robust security and stability. Meanwhile, layer-2 solutions like rollups and sidechains provide scalability without compromising the security of the base layer. Lastly, layer-3 protocols offer specialized environments tailored to specific development needs.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ethereum is too hard to use\n\nOne of the first projects to propose modular blockchain development is the Celestia network. Celestia currently functions by separating execution from consensus and implementing data availability sampling (DAS) as a core feature.\n\nModular blockchains\u2019 adroit-like qualities for specific engineering challenges translate into a targeted effectiveness to service specific industry niches.\n\nTo illustrate, GameSwift, a modular blockchain project, is currently working to facilitate the development of games hosted on-chain. Their goal is to create a network of applications that will help avoid gamers\u2019 in-game purchases or earned assets being stored in a central server and consequently hacked. To highlight the relevance of this innovation, global gaming audiences spent approximately $54 billion on additional in-game content in 2020.\n\nThe shape of things to come\n\nModular projects are already pushing boundaries and redefining what\u2019s possible in the blockchain space. Hybrid optimistic and zero-knowledge solutions are on the horizon, promising even greater scalability and security, as is the application of sharding, incentivized verification and parallelized VMs (virtual machines) on the execution layer of a chain.\n\nWith layer-1s feeling the heat, Ethereum devs released plans for a unified settlement and data availability layer: danksharding, a promising development, and a term I can\u2019t say aloud without curling my lips. But development and on-time delivery for these monolithic chains\u2019 upgrades have been historically slow and unmet.\n\nBy accepting monolithic chains as what might be holding us back, modular architectures offer a glimmer of hope. We are transitioning from monolithic blockchains and siloed consensus layers to modular, application-specific chains with shared consensus layers.\n\nWhile challenges remain in standardizing cross-chain communication and ensuring decentralization at each level, the potential benefits of modular blockchains are too compelling to ignore. These blockchains have the potential, and are already being applied, to impact industries like supply chain management, real estate (property transactions), digital identity verification, energy grid management and even healthcare data management.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a die-hard Bitcoin maximalist or an Ethereum enthusiast, one thing\u2019s for sure: In a modular future, users emerge as the ultimate beneficiaries.\n\nNiko Hosn, CTO of ZTX and founder of RareMint, is an expert in Web3 gaming and blockchain development.

        "title": "Why Is Ethereum Going Up? Unpacking The Sudden Surge - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Representation of Ethereum\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the cryptocurrency market lately, you\u2019re likely aware of the fact that Ethereum has made a 30 percent jump in recent days, marking a two-month high value, and shocking the overall crypto market. The price of Ethereum is $3,727.51 at the time of this writing, though that figure is obviously subject to change as the market continues to fluctuate. Given that ether has been all over the news in recent days, it\u2019s only fair to assume a number of fresh eyes have been placed on the world of crypto investments.\n\nSo, let\u2019s unpack what exactly Ethereum is, how it works, and examine the factors which led to this week\u2019s historic leap. Furthermore, we\u2019ll examine trends in the market and see if we can construct a comprehensive outline of where the decentralized currency will climb in the coming years. Without any further preamble, let\u2019s take a moment to dive into Ethereum, its price, and its applications.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\nLike other hot cryptocurrencies on the market, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain, which utilizes open-source software to regulate price without the control of government forces. The blockchain was first programmed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, and has since grown to become one of the most commonly accepted cryptos on the market, second only to Bitcoin. Ethereum trades in a currency called ether, often abbreviated to ETH, and holds many investors all over the globe. Ether is designed to be programmable and secure, meaning it can be stored in an offline crypto wallet and used to purchase goods and services all over the world.\n\nAs one of the largest and most widely-recognized cryptocurrencies on the market, Ethereum is often utilized by those who are fresh into crypto trading, as well as seasoned veterans of the blockchain. Still, many traders were quite surprised to see that ETH had jumped so high this past week, as the fluctuating value seemingly came out of nowhere, at least to the untrained eye.\n\nWhat Caused Ethereum To Rise?\n\nMarket fluctuations are normal for any form of currency, but have the potential to be especially volatile for the crypto market. Still, a 30 percent jump on a seemingly random Tuesday, combined with ETH being on the market for over a decade, makes this fluctuation quite a surprise. Regardless, those who have had their finger on the pulse saw this Ethereum bump coming, due to a pair of key factors.\n\nFor starters, the SEC is currently on pace to make a decision regarding spot Ethereum\u2019s exchange-traded fund, (or ETF for short) which should make ether easier to trade than ever, and more accessible to the general market. If Ethereum\u2019s ETF does reach final approval from the SEC, prices will undoubtedly soar even higher. The second major factor is simple, as the public has reacted to the impending decision, causing droves of investors to vie for an opportunity to invest greater total funds into ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBasically, market trends were dictated to rise due to the recent upheaval the crypto coin is about to undergo, making investors more enthusiastic than ever to throw their money behind Ethereum funds. Bitcoin had a similar surge when it was approved by the SEC, so many crypto investors are currently hoping that their investment will see a similar meteoric rise.\n\nHow Much Will Ethereum Be Worth By The End Of 2024?\n\nDue to intense market changes, it can be quite difficult to predict the value of any cryptocurrency in advance. Still, some experts have maintained a watchful eye of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and managed to put together a comprehensive idea of where the market might take their value. According to Investing Haven, Ethereum was projected to level out somewhere between #2,222 and $3,597 before the recent ETF news. Bullish projections now see the coin reaching highs of $5,000 to $9,000 with any luck, though these figures are still wholly speculative.\n\nThe most important sign of Ethereum\u2019s success is actually, somewhat surprisingly, the US dollar, as that is the highest source of ETH investments at this time. Experts have advised those interested in making crypto investments to follow the trend of the US dollar, and invest based on successes in that market, as announced by the federal reserve.\n\nHow Much Will One Ether Be Worth In 2030?\n\nWhile short-term trends are nearly impossible to calculate, long-term trends suggest that Ethereum will continue to rise in the coming years, meaning it\u2019s still likely a prudent move to invest now, despite the exponential increase of the past week. Per a financial report in Forbes, a single share of Ether could reach highs of $40,000 by the end of 2030. While this figure may seem astronomic, it was calculated using several key factors, including the safety and scalability of Ethereum, the comprehensive market strategy put forth by blockchain developers, and the rise of additional decentralized platforms.\n\nWhile it can be quite scary to break into the world of crypto trading, Ethereum seems like it\u2019s currently on track to be one of the most accessible high-yield investments in recent memory. Still, be sure to invest carefully if you do decide to engage with the crypto market. Do lots of independent research, interface with known and trusted advisors, and as always, never get out over your skis."

        "title": "5 Things to Know About Ethereum's First Spot Price ETFs - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The SEC has finally cleared the way for the first Ether spot price ETFs.\n\nOn May 22, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first eight applications for Ether (ETH 0.33%) spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Grayscale, Bitwise, iShares, VanEck, Ark Invest, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Ether is the world's second largest cryptocurrency and the main coin of the Ethereum Network.\n\nThat announcement came just four months after the SEC cleared the first spot price Bitcoin (BTC -0.94%) ETFs for trading. But should investors assume these planned ETFs will set a firm floor under Ether's price and become compelling long-term investments? Let's review the five key facts to decide.\n\n1. The first Ether ETFs won't start trading anytime soon\n\nThe SEC approved the initial regulatory filings for the eight Ether ETFs, but they won't start trading until the agency approves their S-1 filings. That process could take several months. For reference, the SEC approved the S-1 filings for the first Bitcoin spot price ETFs approximately three months after clearing their initial regulatory filings.\n\n2. The decision turns Ether into a commodity\n\nIn the past, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains both used an energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method to produce coins. But in 2022, the Ethereum Network switched to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method. That transition, known as \"The Merge,\" reduced the network's energy consumption by 99.95% and made it deflationary -- which meant more Ether was being burned than produced.\n\nHowever, the SEC initially claimed The Merge made the Ether coin and Ethereum-based tokens more similar to securities than commodities. The move made a radical change to how Ether coins are created and managed. Regulators then repeatedly declared that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified and pinned to spot price as a commodity, since it was digitally mined like a precious metal through the PoW method.\n\nTherefore, the SEC's decision to approve the first Ether ETF filings implies the coin can now be classified as a commodity instead of a security. That shift might clear the way for smaller Ethereum-based tokens such as Shiba Inu -- as well as independent PoS-driven cryptocurrencies like Solana -- to get their own spot price ETFs.\n\n3. Ether ETF investors can't stake their holdings\n\nAnother key difference between Ether and Bitcoin is the process of \"staking,\" which allows investors to earn interest by locking up their Ether coins on the network for a period of time. The SEC, which argues that staking-as-a-service solutions should be classified as unregistered securities, previously sued cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase (COIN -6.83%) and Kraken for allowing users to stake their own coins.\n\nGrayscale, Ark, and the other firms originally wanted to add staking features in their ETFs, but they removed those proposals in their updated filings last month. That change could make their ETFs less appealing than the actual digital coins.\n\n4. The SEC approved the filings probably to avoid more litigation\n\nLast year, the SEC lost a lawsuit against Grayscale, which had sued the agency for trying to block the conversion of its popular Bitcoin trust into an ETF. That loss softened the SEC's position and cleared the way for the first Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEarlier this year, blockchain company Consensys sued the SEC for its refusal to recognize Ether as a commodity, while Grayscale and its peers were widely expected to sue the SEC again if it didn't approve their regulatory filings for spot price ETFs. So for now, it seems the SEC has backed off on tightly regulating Ether to avoid more legal battles.\n\n5. The Ether ETFs should attract less attention than the Bitcoin ETFs\n\nGrayscale currently holds nearly $11 billion in assets in its GrayScale Ethereum Trust (ETHE -3.95%), which it's attempting to convert into a spot price ETF. However, that's a lot smaller than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust before its conversion into its spot price ETF, which now hosts more than $20 billion in assets.\n\nThese new Ether ETFs might attract some attention from mainstream and institutional investors, but they probably won't gain as much momentum as the Bitcoin spot price ETFs earlier this year. Ether also doesn't have any major near-term catalysts that are comparable to Bitcoin's halving, which halved the rewards for mining, earlier this year.\n\nShould you buy the Ether ETFs?\n\nThe Ether ETFs might not attract as many investors as the Bitcoin ETFs, but they might represent an easy way for investors to gain exposure to Ether without directly buying the coins. But investors should still be mindful of the fees, see if they actually match Ether's spot price, and realize they won't be able to stake their holdings.\n\nTherefore, investors shouldn't rush to buy the Ether ETFs once they hit the market. Instead, they should wait and see if the convenience of owning these ETFs in a brokerage account outweighs the advantages of owning Ether in a crypto wallet."

        "content": "So-called memecoins have been rallying over the past week\u2014and among the five cryptocurrencies to gain the most are four Solana-based tokens. Floki leads the way (up 35%), followed by dogwifhat (32%), Pepe (27%), and Bonk (22%), according to CoinGecko data as of Tuesday morning. Bonk reached highs of $0.00004387, missing its all-time high of $0.00004547 in March by a razor-thin edge.\n\nThe price surges overlap with the Securities and Exchange Commission green-lighting eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds, with firms such as BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity among the filers. Memecoins, considered to be the highest risk and highest reward part of the crypto industry, often witness notable price swings during a pro-crypto news cycle. By contrast, Ether has climbed a modest 2% since Thursday\u2019s approvals, trading at $3,847 on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe ETF approvals have \u201cpeople bullish on the far fringes of the coin space,\u201d Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University, told Fortune.\n\nIndeed, Google Trends data shows that search interest for \u201cEthereum\u201d over the past 12 months is near all-time highs, and memecoins are \u201cheavily driven\u201d by this kind of market attention, says Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that as money flows into the ecosystem through ETFs, it often trickles down to these smaller projects,\u201d Jonathan Bixby, chairman of Phoenix Digital Assets, told Fortune. Memecoins have surged recently because of their \u201csmall caps\u201d compared with those of other cryptocurrencies, he says.\n\nMemecoins occupy just a fraction of the market capitalization of major currencies: Floki boasts a market cap of just $2.9 billion, compared with Ethereum\u2019s $460 billion, according to CoinGecko data. In other words, Bixby suggests that investors of fringe coins could be anticipating a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats effect once the ETFs begin trading.\n\nHowever, Matt Ballensweig, managing director at BitGo, told Fortune that he doesn\u2019t attribute the recent growth for some memecoins to the ETF approvals or a single event, but it is \u201ca sign that momentum across other layer 1s (such as Solana) continues to remain strong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSolana has basically solidified itself as the chain with the most \u2018speculative fun\u2019 as traders continue to gamble on memecoins on decentralized exchanges.\u201d\n\nOne reason why Ether has shown minimal price movements since Thursday is likely because, so far, the SEC has approved only the 19b-4 forms. These initial filings submitted by soon-to-be issuers allow the securities to be listed on exchanges. But for trading of the financial instruments to begin, the SEC must next approve the issuers\u2019 S-1 filings. These forms outline to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t recall anytime there would be S-1s not approved after a 19b-4 approval. I don\u2019t think a precedent exists,\u201d Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, previously told Fortune. He estimated the forms would take about two weeks to be approved."

The high-end forecast implies a 503% gain from current prices levels of around $3,890.\n\n\"Ethereum ETF approval is one of the most significant bullish events for Ethereum and the entire ecosystem,\" Lin wrote, adding: \"Even if ETH ETF does not gain as much traction as bitcoin in the initial weeks and months, it will still likely attract a staggeringly large amount of capital in the long run.\"\n\nA few reasons back her thesis, but generally, it's that ethereum is a tough contender against bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor one, ether offers an annual yield through staking, and is more than just a store of value asset. The ethereum blockchain is exposed to technologies such as DeFi and NFTs, offering it more functionality than bitcoin.\n\n\"Bitcoin could become the Dow Jones of crypto ETFs, while Ethereum becomes its NASDAQ,\" Lin said.\n\nUpside will also follow from a well-established correlation between bitcoin and ether pricing, which should actually tighten, Lin said. Not only is this because of the tech crypto's rising demand, but also due to a major supply shift that occurred in September 2022:\n\n\"The 20-month period before that date saw ETH supply increase from 114 million to 120 million, an increase of 5%. Today, 20 months since that date, ETH supply remains at the same 120 million,\" Lin said. \"Bitcoin, on the other hand, has seen its supply increase by 2.9% during the same period.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that case, ether could reach the $22,500 target if bitcoin manages to climb to $150,000 this year, an estimate frequently published by Standard Chartered. The asset is currently trading at over $68,000.\n\n\"Overall, I know the market is bullish on Ethereum right now, but it's not bullish enough. Now the spot ETH ETF is approved, all indicators indicate a massive ETH bull run in the coming months,\" Lin wrote.\n\nAlthough it could still take weeks before the new ETFs start trading, their approval sparked a slew of bullish excitement, though few see prices reach as high as Lin's forecast. For instance, Standard Chartered, expects ether to hit $8,000 by this year's end."

        "title": "3 Little-Known Facts About Why Ethereum ETFs Could Be Mega-Bullish for Coinbase - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "An Ethereum ETF would significantly boost Coinbase's business and could catapult its stock.\n\nIt has been quite the year for Coinbase Global (COIN -6.83%). Crypto is back in a bull market, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.98%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and Coinbase posted its first profitable quarter in more than two years. As a result, its stock has risen more than 275% in the last year.\n\nAnd as is common in bull markets, the good news keeps on coming. Rumors are swirling that the SEC will green-light a spot Ethereum (ETH 0.33%) ETF soon. Not only is Coinbase going to be the custodian for some of these ETFs, but a pending approval will also create a domino effect of benefits for the company as interest in Ethereum grows.\n\nHere are three little-known facts about why the Ethereum ETF approval will give the company a major boost.\n\n1. It will increase volume on the platform\n\nWhen the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, many believed they would deal a blow to Coinbase. Since investors could now gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through an ETF trading on the stock market, why would they use Coinbase?\n\nWhile the concerns were valid at the time, we can now see that the approval of the ETFs generated massive trading volumes on Coinbase. The exchange saw volume on its platform increase by 300%.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. Ethereum is the second-most-traded cryptocurrency on Coinbase. And since the exchange generates revenue from trading fees, if a similar outcome arises after the approval of an Ethereum ETF, then Coinbase will be raking in some serious profits. The more trading that happens, the more money it will make.\n\n2. Staking should get a boost\n\nOne of Coinbase's most popular products is its staking service. When buying Ethereum on its platform, the company allows users to easily stake it and earn passive income with just a few button clicks. For providing this service, it takes a 25% cut of the staking rewards it pays to users.\n\nShould Ethereum's price follow a similar trajectory to that of Bitcoin after it got its spot ETF approval, then that 25% cut will grow significantly. Imagine the difference this will have when considering that Coinbase manages billions of dollars of staked Ethereum.\n\nWe can see the impact that rising Ethereum prices could have on Coinbase's bottom line just by looking at last quarter's earnings report. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase saw a 59% increase in its Blockchain Rewards (staking) revenue as Ethereum's price jumped 60%.\n\nWhile this is only one quarter, the increase in staking revenue corresponds nearly directly to the increase in Ethereum's value. If the crypto's value jumps 50% as Bitcoin's did in the three months after it received spot ETF approval, Coinbase's Blockchain Reward segment should see a similar increase or a jump of roughly $75 million.\n\n3. The first company built on Ethereum\n\nThe last benefit that an approval of spot Ethereum ETFs will have for Coinbase is slightly abstract, but it might be the most lucrative. The company has two main products that are uniquely Ethereum-based: Base and USDC (USDC 0.01%).\n\nLaunched In August 2023, Base is Coinbase's very own blockchain. The technical matters of this are a conversation for another day, but what is important is that Base is compatible with Ethereum, and for every transaction that occurs on Base, the company gets a cut.\n\nSince the beginning of March, Base produced nearly $35 million in profits as users flocked to the blockchain in the wake of Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, which lowered fees on Layer 2 blockchains like Base.\n\nIf activity stays on its current trajectory, Base could produce somewhere around $200 million on an annual basis. That's not bad when considering that Coinbase posted net income of $95 million in all 2023.\n\nThen there is USDC. Coinbase leverages this stablecoin in several ways to generate revenue, including interest income from reserves; transaction and conversion fees; custody services; and through its partnership with Circle, the creator of the stablecoin. In the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase raked in roughly $197 million in revenue from USDC.\n\nSince USDC and Base are both based on Ethereum, an ETF approval could produce serious benefits. There is no easy way to quantify it, but if the Bitcoin ETF approval sparked increased activity on Bitcoin, then it is plausible to assume an ETF approval for Ethereum will lead to a surge of interest and activity for that crypto, inevitably trickling over into Coinbase's Ethereum-based services.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe most obvious benefit for Coinbase and the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is that it will be the custodian for five of the eight ETF applicants. This will produce additional revenue, but a deeper understanding of Coinbase's Ethereum-centric business model shows that just being a custodian for the ETFs will pale in comparison to the ripple effect across its revenue streams.\n\nTo put it simply, what is good for Ethereum is good for Coinbase. Best of all, we are only in the beginning stages of greater acceptance and interest in Ethereum and its unique role in the digital economy.\n\nHow much of a catalyst this will be for Coinbase's stock remains unknown, but rest assured, it will make the company much more valuable than it is today."

        "content": "Ethereum Could See Bull Run Following SEC Approval of ETFs, According to Analysts\n\nMarket analysts predict that Ethereum is on the brink of a significant upward trajectory following the recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After facing delays and limited engagement, the top regulator in Wall Street gave the green light to a substantial number of asset managers seeking to offer Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIndustry observers like data firm Kaiko anticipate a further surge in value for the second-largest digital currency as a result of this development. While there may be some downward pressure on the price of ETH due to expected outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has been trading at a discount for the past three months, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain positive.\n\nKaiko draws its conclusion from the impact of Bitcoin ETFs following their approval in January. Investors who had invested in Grayscale's GBTC product immediately sought to cash out, leading to a short-term decline in Bitcoin's price. Kaiko suggests that a similar trend could occur with Ethereum ETFs, causing selling pressure on ETH due to outflows from Grayscale's ETHE.\n\nHowever, despite potential short-term challenges, Kaiko emphasizes that the regulatory approval of Ethereum ETFs has important implications for ETH as an asset. It removes some of the regulatory uncertainty that has affected Ethereum's performance over the past year. JPMorgan, the largest bank in America, expects the funds to begin trading before November."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nData from Coinglass shows that Ethereum has experienced a remarkable surge in May, rising nearly 30% with a few days remaining. This marks Ethereum\u2019s best monthly performance since February when it jumped 46%. This recovery is significant, especially considering the 17% drop it faced in April. A key factor in May\u2019s rebound is the approval of the Ethereum ETF 19-b filings, which has bolstered investor confidence.\n\nHistorical data from Coinglass indicates that May is typically Ethereum\u2019s strongest month, with an average gain of 31%. As we transition into June, it\u2019s noteworthy that Ethereum has only had two historically negative months: June and September. This makes the upcoming month particularly intriguing for Ethereum watchers.\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin has also shown positive movement, increasing by over 12% in May, attempting to recover from a 15% drop in April. Historically, June has been a flat month for Bitcoin, averaging just a 0.25% increase, according to Coinglass data.\n\nDespite Ethereum trailing behind Bitcoin as an institutional asset, it shares similarities in the long-term holding behavior of its investors. With current trends and narratives favoring Ethereum, it may continue to outperform Bitcoin, as evidenced by the positive year-to-date ETH/BTC ratio. This suggests a shift in dominance towards Ethereum in the ongoing digital asset market dynamics."

        "content": "Michael Nadeau, a prominent crypto analyst, recently provided an in-depth analysis of the current and future state of the cryptocurrency market, with a particular focus on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nMichael Nadeau is a well-regarded crypto analyst known for his work at The DeFi Report, where he provides in-depth research and analysis on decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. Nadeau is particularly noted for his insights into the performance and valuation of blockchain networks like Ethereum.\n\nAccording to ETF experts at Bloomberg, ETH ETF flows are expected to represent about 10-20% of BTC ETF flows. This prediction is based on several factors:\n\nLower institutional interest in ETH compared to BTC.\n\nGreater complexity in understanding ETH.\n\nLower trading volumes in ETH futures compared to BTC (10-20%).\n\nLower spot trading volumes of ETH relative to BTC (about 50%).\n\nETH\u2019s market cap being approximately one-third of BTC\u2019s.\n\nGiven that BTC ETFs have seen about $13 billion in net flows since their launch, Nadeau suggests that if ETH achieves 10-20% of this figure, it would result in $1.3-$2.6 billion in net inflows for ETH ETFs.\n\nNadeau draws a parallel between BTC\u2019s price surge after the US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs launched and potential movements in ETH. BTC saw a 75% gain from $40,000 to $70,000 shortly after its spot ETFs started trading, leading Nadeau to expect a similar performance from ETH, potentially pushing it past its previous all-time high of $4,800.\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to ETH\u2019s outperformance:\n\nETH validators do not have the same \u201cstructural sell pressure\u201d as BTC miners, who need to sell a portion of their mined coins to cover operating expenses.\n\nA significant portion (38%) of ETH supply is \u201csoft locked\u201d on-chain, earning yield in staking contracts, DeFi applications, or as collateral.\n\nETH balances on exchanges are at their lowest since 2016, suggesting less sell pressure.\n\nETH\u2019s reflexivity could amplify price movements, with price action leading to more on-chain activity, more ETH burned, and further narrative-driven price increases.\n\nNadeau envisions ETH not just as a cryptocurrency but as a technology play on the growth of Web3, offering a larger addressable market than BTC, which is viewed as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\nNadeau extends his analysis to the broader crypto market, expressing a highly bullish outlook. He anticipates favorable conditions driven by several cycles:\n\nInnovation Cycle : Continued advancements in blockchain technology and DeFi.\n\n: Continued advancements in blockchain technology and DeFi. Macro/Liquidity Cycle : Favorable economic conditions and increased liquidity.\n\n: Favorable economic conditions and increased liquidity. Election Cycle : Political developments influencing market sentiment.\n\n: Political developments influencing market sentiment. Bitcoin Halving Cycle : Historical patterns showing price increases post-halving.\n\n: Historical patterns showing price increases post-halving. ETF Approvals: Increased accessibility and interest through BTC and ETH ETFs.\n\nHe points out that regulatory concerns have lessened, particularly with the market no longer fearing aggressive actions from regulators like Gary Gensler.\n\nUsing a hypothetical $10 trillion market cap for crypto, he makes the following predictions:\n\nBTC at 40% of the market cap would reach $4 trillion, translating to a price of $202,000 per BTC.\n\nETH at 45% of BTC\u2019s market cap would reach a $1.8 trillion market cap, implying a price of $14,984 per ETH.\n\nHe points out that this assumes no change in supply from current levels. He also mentions that even more conservative estimates suggest significant price increases for both BTC and ETH."

        "title": "Ethereum Could Witness Supply Shock and Sharp Upturn in Price When Fed Pivots: CoinShares Head of Research - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "A top executive from digital asset manager CoinShares believes market conditions could soon send Ethereum (ETH) soaring.\n\nIn a new interview with Scott Melker, CoinShares\u2019 head of research James Butterfill says a likely upcoming Fed pivot could be bullish for both Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH.\n\nButterfill says Ethereum could see additional upside momentum around the time the Fed starts cutting rates from the potential launch of spot market ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a supply crunch due to investors already staking a large amount of the top altcoin.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the futures market, interest rate expectations is saying first rate cut [is] not to be until December. I do think the first rate cut will be bigger than expected and later than expected, i.e. a knee-jerk reaction\u2026\n\nIt would be actually very bullish for something like Bitcoin, which is massively sensitive to interest rate expectations\u2026\n\nCertainly on the Ethereum side, it\u2019s interesting. The amount of circulating supply of Ethereum is quite low because a lot of people are staking. Now the new ETFs, they won\u2019t be able to stake when they\u2019re launched in July, most likely, so there could well be a bit of a squeeze going on, a supply squeeze, and that could lead to some quite sharp uprises in prices.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $3,761 at time of writing, down more than 2% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Taking a Breather Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "These three megacap tokens are seeing significant selling pressure to kick off the short week.\n\nAs we kick off a short week, investors in a range of speculative assets are seeing selling pressure build. Of course, there are plenty of macro reasons for this trepidation. Some rather important inflation readings are due later this week, which could impact everything from growth stocks to commodities to cryptocurrencies. Everything is tied to interest rates these days.\n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin (BTC -0.95%), Ethereum (ETH 0.32%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -3.81%) are among the megacap tokens seeing declines today. Over the past 24 hours, these three top tokens have slumped 3.8%, 3.5%, and 4%, respectively, as of 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving today's price action in these top tokens.\n\nEnthusiasm over key catalysts wears off\n\nInvestors in these three megacap tokens have certainly had quite the run over the past few weeks, and really since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin started the party off with the approval of a dozen spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, which conjured up some significant demand for its token. In combination with a halving event, which saw the amount of newly minted Bitcoin slashed in half, this created a supply-and-demand dynamic investors liked.\n\nEthereum recently saw similar catalysts take hold, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs last week as well. Additionally, previous upgrades have resulted in Ethereum becoming less inflationary, and depending on the day, deflationary based on token burn metrics relative to transaction volumes.\n\nAs a more speculative asset, Dogecoin has ridden market momentum higher. But with these catalysts now seemingly in the rearview mirror (it's really amazing how quickly the market adjusts to news, particularly in this space), some investors may be looking to sell into this news and wait patiently for another catalyst to take hold. A similar \"sell the news\" effect took place immediately following the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nUntil the next catalyst takes hold, investors appear to be on pause for the next reason to bet big on this sector (and these three tokens by default).\n\nA pause in the rally, or a reversal?\n\nNow, the question is whether this recent dip is a sign of more downside to come, or if it's simply a consolidation period before the next move higher. Earlier this month, a speculative wave hit the crypto sector, driving everything from meme tokens like Dogecoin to large-cap cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum higher. But since then, it appears the broader crypto market is awaiting the next catalyst on the horizon.\n\nThere is certainly a tremendous amount of innovation and technological movement happening underneath the surface in the crypto realm. I wouldn't be surprised to see headlines pop up for any of these three tokens that have the ability to move the market higher, with all three benefiting from positive news. I just don't know what the catalyst will be, or when positive momentum can be expected to build again. For now, I'm happily watching this price action from the sidelines."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nWith the Ethereum ETF craze covering the cryptocurrency market like a fog, the activity of large holders is through the roof. More than $8 billion worth of ETH has been transferred between whales, which creates an interesting situation: the activity is here, but the price is not moving for now, consolidating at around $3,900.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis amount of large transactions is remarkable. There have been more than 6,780 large transactions in the past 24 hours and a seven day high of 9,790 transactions, But for all the activity, the price of ETH has been relatively unresponsive.\n\nThe chart reveals that there are extremely high levels of transactions being offered up, amounting to an incredible 2.14 million ETH in the past day. This level of transactions is in line with the current hype over an ETF, since institutional interest tends to drive whale behavior.\n\nThe seven-day high for transaction volume was 3.21 million ETH, while the low was approximately 981,530 ETH. The implications of this volatility are that there is an extremely fluid market in which large holders are very much on the move and shaking about, presumably in the hope of signaling impending price movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOddly, though the transactions are high in the number of units and in value in many cases, there is relative moderation in price volatility. The volatility index lists a 30-day high of 62.38% and a low of 40.72%, and that means the market, with all of its transactions, is not experiencing big price swings.\n\nIf the ETF story continues to play out and more institutional money comes into the ETH space, a breakout higher than $4,000 may become a reality in the future. But, if this action is simply a reprieve to profit, or a redistribution in the face of weakness being perceived below the surface of the market, it may have trouble keeping up its courage."

        "content": "Recent events in the cryptocurrency world highlight Nvidia Corp\u2018s NVDA influence on AI-related tokens. Nvidia, a leader in AI technology, reported higher-than-expected earnings for Q1, causing a stir in the digital assets market. Tokens like Render RNDR/USD, closely tied to Nvidia, saw notable market movements.\n\nRender's value surged before Nvidia's earnings announcement but dipped briefly due to profit-taking. This demonstrates how AI-related cryptocurrencies react to major tech developments.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum and Tokenized Assets\n\nEthereum ETH/USD is central to the digital asset space, especially with the anticipated approval of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF. Ondo Finance, a project backed by Coinbase, has gained attention by backing its OUSG token with BlackRock's BUIDL tokenized fund. This move represents the growing integration of traditional financial assets with blockchain technology, pointing to a future where tokenized assets play a role in investment portfolios.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Whale Activity\n\nWhale activity in the AI token world has been notable. Santiment reported that a known whale moved nearly 4.9 million RNDR tokens, indicating heightened market interest and volatility. This movement and rising long positions among traders suggest a strong belief in the potential of AI-related cryptocurrencies. It highlights the interplay between advancements in AI and the growing crypto market.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s Transformative Role\n\nBlockchain technology revolutionizes financial transactions by enhancing security and speeding up processes. The Benzinga event will feature discussions on the latest advancements in blockchain, including staking, mining, and custody technologies. Understanding these developments is crucial as digital assets become more integrated into mainstream financial systems.\n\nThe intersection of AI and digital assets is reshaping the future of financial transactions. Nvidia's recent earnings and the subsequent market response of tokens like Render highlight the increasing relevance of AI in the crypto space. Ethereum's expanding role, illustrated by projects like Ondo Finance, points to a broader acceptance of tokenized assets within traditional finance.\n\nFuture of Digital Assets\n\nThese market dynamics set the stage for Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on Nov. 19. Attendees can expect in-depth discussions on the integration of AI and blockchain and their broader implications for the financial industry.\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has created a significant buzz in the crypto market. However, what many might have expected didn\u2019t happen, Ether\u2019s price has barely moved following this groundbreaking news\u2014unlike when the likelihood of its approval pushed Ethereum\u2019s price to a two month high.\n\nMarket Reaction Post-Approval\n\nOn May 23, the SEC approved eight spot Ether ETFs to be listed on their respective exchanges. Prior to the announcement, Ether (ETH) experienced a 3.4% drop but recovered by around 5% shortly after, trading at $3,806 at the time of writing. Despite the approval, Ether\u2019s price did not exhibit a significant upward trend, reflecting a complex market reaction.\n\nCrypto commentator Zach Rynes argues that the lack of significant movement post-approval reflects the notion that \u201ceveryone who wanted to buy the approval already did.\u201d Ether had already surged 29% over the past week following reports that the SEC might approve the ETFs, indicating that the approval news was already priced in by the market.\n\nThe SEC approved a rule change that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether, one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies. The decision comes less than six months after the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs. https://t.co/5KntbFp5Jv pic.twitter.com/1wQD2tv1IO \u2014 CNBC (@CNBC) May 23, 2024\n\nAlthough the ETFs have been approved, they have not yet been cleared to launch. An approved S-1 filing, which includes comprehensive details on the firm\u2019s financials and risk profile, is still required. VanEck has recently submitted its amended S-1 filing to the SEC, and analysts suggest it could take weeks to months for these filings to be approved. This delay means that the actual influx of new capital is still pending.\n\nFuture Expectations\n\nThe options market continues to show significant open interest in ETH options, particularly for expiry dates in late May. With open interest of $867 million for May 24 and $3.22 billion for May 31 on Deribit, the market remains bullish. If Ether\u2019s price stays above $3,600, many put options will become worthless, favoring call options and potentially driving further bullish sentiment.\n\nCrypto research firm Second Mountain anticipates a \u201cmassive capital inflow in the first week\u201d following the ETFs\u2019 launch, potentially reaching billions. However, the immediate impact might not result in a sharp upward trend, as seen with Bitcoin\u2019s price after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved earlier this year.\n\nThere are also concerns regarding Grayscale\u2019s announcement of its plans to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ether ETF, which could lead to significant outflows. This mirrors the situation with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw substantial asset outflows.\n\nHistory could repeat itself when Grayscale launches its spot Ether ETF \u2014 meaning millions in $ETH outflows daily, according to @KaikoData. pic.twitter.com/Ojwa6VMHCY \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 28, 2024\n\nThe approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States marks a significant milestone for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. This development is expected to boost Ether\u2019s price, potentially driving it to $10,000 by the end of 2024, as suggested by Andrey Stoychev of Nexo. The SEC\u2019s approval of these ETFs is seen as a positive shift, possibly influenced by political pressures and the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nDespite the initial market reaction being muted, with Ether\u2019s price experiencing only modest fluctuations, the full impact of these ETFs will likely be realized once the required S-1 filings are approved and the ETFs are launched. Analysts predict that this could take weeks to months, but once operational, these ETFs are anticipated to attract substantial institutional investment and increase market liquidity.\n\nAs the market adjusts to this new development, investor confidence is expected to grow, leading to sustained positive momentum for Ether. The approval is a promising step towards greater adoption and integration of Ethereum into the financial mainstream, setting the stage for significant future growth.\n\nAuthor: Makinde Adeniyi\n\nThe editorial team at #DisruptionBanking has taken all precautions to ensure that no persons or organisations have been adversely affected or offered any sort of financial advice in this article.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price nears $4,000, influenced by optimism around newly approved ETFs.\n\nMarket analysts suggest the potential for Ethereum to reach as high as $10,000 in the current cycle.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving applications for Ethereum [ETH]-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), the king of altcoins has showcased a vigorous uptick.\n\nStarting the week on a strong note, Ethereum recorded a 3.7% increase in the last 24 hours, pushing its price near the significant $4,000 mark, a considerable rise from recent weeks.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum traded at $3,899, marking a significant rebound from earlier fluctuations.\n\nEthereum faces potential $4,500 target\n\nAmid this price movement from Ethereum, Arthur Cheong, CEO of DeFiance Capital, suggested that Ethereum might reach $4,500 before the trading of its spot ETFs commences, potentially in July or August.\n\nCheong drew parallels to the 2017 crypto boom, indicating that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs could attract a substantial retail investor base.\n\nThis is much like its Bitcoin [BTC] counterparts, which are seeing over 70% of positions held by retail investors.\n\nThe enthusiasm around Ethereum\u2019s future performance is palpable among investors and market spectators.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that these projections remain speculative, with the actual market trajectory dependent on numerous factors including broader economic conditions and investor sentiment.\n\nMoreover, the SEC\u2019s current regulatory landscape shows a green light only for the initial 19b-4 requests for Ethereum ETFs, with the essential S-1 forms still awaiting approval.\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish trends\n\nDespite these regulatory hurdles, Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics have shown robust growth, not only in price but also in fundamental on-chain metrics.\n\nData from Santiment highlighted a surge in Ethereum\u2019s price volatility, a metric that has significantly increased from its low in the past fortnight to a notable peak today.\n\nNotably, as the cryptocurrency\u2019s price volatility is increasing along with its price, this indicates a period of heightened trading activity and interest, often driven by speculative buying.\n\nAdding to the growing interest, Glassnode reported an uptick in the number of new Ethereum addresses, suggesting an expanding network of users.\n\nSuch a rise typically signifies increased market participation, potentially buoyed by the positive market sentiment and broader adoption.\n\nMoreover, Coinglass\u2019 data revealed a spike in Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest, underscoring an active derivatives market with heightened trading volumes.\n\nThis not only pointed to increased liquidity, but also to a rising speculative interest where traders anticipate forthcoming price movements.\n\nNonetheless, an increase in Open Interest also implies greater market leverage, which could amplify both gains and losses, depending on market directions.\n\nTechnical analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart revealed that the cryptocurrency has recently breached the $3,700 resistance level flipping it to support, setting its sights on the next significant milestone at $4,000.\n\nThis breakthrough suggests that bullish momentum is strong, potentially driving further gains.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConcurrently, AMBCrypto, citing data from Glassnode, reported a significant decrease in Ethereum\u2019s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio.\n\nA reduction in this ratio suggests that the asset is currently undervalued, which may indicate an impending rise in its market price."

        "title": "Analyst Sets Bar High with Bitcoin (BTC) at $150,000, Ethereum (ETH) at $15,000 Predictions - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to pull crowds with stunning rallies this year. With the approval of their respective spot ETFs, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrencies are expected to attract billions.\n\nAs such, popular analyst Lark Davis has made bold predictions for the top assets.\n\nBold Predictions For Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn a recent tweet, Davis predicted that Bitcoin will soar to $150,000 and Ethereum will reach $15,000, driven by market dynamics. He points to the inflows already seen in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are attracting hundreds of millions of dollars daily.\n\nEthereum ETFs are on the cusp of starting trading, expected to further fuel market enthusiasm. Davis said he anticipates a bullish scenario where a peak bull market coincides with massive investments from countries, wealth managers, pension funds, and retail investors, resulting in billions of dollars being funneled into ETFs daily.\n\nThis confluence of factors, according to Davis, means current bullish sentiments are likely underestimating the potential growth.\n\n\u201cImagine the scenes when retail is here, and the bull market is at its peak. When countries, wealth managers, pension funds, and retail will be buying billions of dollars worth of ETFs daily. You are seriously not bullish enough.\u201d\n\nBTC ETFs Hoard 1M BTC; ETH Prepares for Upswing\n\nAs of May 24th, the total amount of Bitcoin held by all spot ETFs stands at around 1,002,343 BTC, with a notable proportion allocated to US-based products out of the 32 ETFs currently available. This signals growing mainstream acceptance and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly in the US.\n\nMoreover, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over a million BTC implies increased demand for the asset. As these ETFs acquire and hold Bitcoin, it reduces the available supply in circulation.\n\nWith the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply fixed and diminishing due to factors such as halving events, increased institutional interest and investment through ETFs could intensify scarcity, potentially driving up demand and prices further.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price failed to challenge the $4,000 resistance, but promising signs are emerging that could cause a much-needed spike, as per the latest price analysis."

At the time of writing, ETH is worth $3,845, in a pump of +15% compared to a month ago.\n\nNot only that, with this approval, the SEC of the USA would have also confirmed that Ethereum is not a security and that, therefore, it is legitimized to soar in the bull market.\n\n\u201c`html\n\nPersino il CEO di Binance, Richard Teng, si \u00e8 voluto sbilanciare commentando tale evento come una milestone for the entire crypto sector che sta ottenendo sempre pi\u00f9 una growing acceptance within traditional frameworks.\n\nEthereum: what is the Pectra update?\n\n\u201c`\n\nThe new Pectra update will be implemented between the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, introducing exclusive features within EVM wallets.\n\nNello specifico, l\u2019aggiornamento include l\u2019Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF), che presenta 11 proposte di miglioramento volte a potenziare il codice EVM.\n\nAmong the various novelties, Pectra will introduce the ability to delegate functions to smart contracts directly from the crypto wallet, approve transactions in batch, and pay for gas with different ERC20 tokens.\n\nNot only, Pectra will integrate the EIP-7251, the proposal that aims to increase the staking limit for validators by 64 times, going from the canonical 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe new proposal by Vitalik Buterin, the EIP-7702, will then introduce a new type of transaction that will allow Ethereum account addresses to temporarily function as smart contract wallets during a transaction, then restoring their original state.\n\nETH price predictions for 2025\n\nAnalysts at work: it is time to consider in the various price forecasts for Ethereum for 2025, also the introduction of the Petra update.\n\nAt the moment, the three hypotheses for the current bull run of Ethereum, and therefore short-term forecasts for ETH are:\n\nETH supera i 4.000$;\n\nETH above $4,100, shifting the target to $5,000 ;\n\n; ETH could reach $6,600.\n\nIn the long term, however, some predictions see the price of ETH reaching $5,000 by the end of 2024, while in 2025, ETH should reach the maximum level of $6,500. It should be specified, however, that such predictions do not mention the new Pectra update."

Michael Saylor also commented on the recent spot ETH ETF approval by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price yet to react to ETF approval, experts share reason for SEC's change of mind\n\nDaily digest market movers: Bullish sentiment, Michael Saylor, Pectra upgrade\n\nFollowing ETH's price gain on Monday, trading firm QCP Capital noted that market participants are becoming more bullish on the largest altcoin, considering potential institutional demand when spot ETH ETFs go live.\n\nETH has gained about 27% since last week after it became apparent that the SEC would approve issuers' 19b-4 filings submitted by exchanges. While the regulator has yet to approve S-1 applications, several analysts have expressed that these approvals are a matter of when and not if; hence, most investors are extremely bullish. This is visible in the ETH Fear and Greed Index, which hit 76 on Wednesday, signifying increased investor confidence.\n\nHowever, QCP Capital noted, \"While we are structurally positive ETH, we don't see a major breakout until we have more clarity on the S-1 approvals and get some inflow data, which should only be a matter of time.\"\n\nRead more: SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs after shocking U-turn\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale CEO Michael Saylor, who earlier predicted that the SEC would deny spot ETH ETF applications, has said, \"You have to rethink all your models\" after the approval. He said that a spot Ethereum ETF is good for Bitcoin as it, together with other crypto assets, \"serves as another line of defense for Bitcoin.\"\n\nAlso, Ethereum developers have projected Q1 2025 to potentially launch the Pectra upgrade after the Dencun upgrade in March. Pectra will feature several updates, including:\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal EIP-7251, which will increase the limit of maximum number of staked ETH per validator from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.\n\nEIP-7702 replacing EIP-3074 to enable account abstraction where Ethereum addresses can temporarily function as smart contracts during a transaction.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF), aimed at improving the EVM code framework for the Main Chain and Layer 2 functionalities.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum attempts to break past key level\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,924 on Monday after gaining nearly 3%. ETH bulls are showing strength with only $7.76 million in long liquidations compared to $15.59 million in short liquidations.\n\nWhile ETH has rejected the $4,000 key level twice since the ETF approval, it may break past this level when the market fully resumes on Tuesday. If ETH successfully overcomes $4,000, it would aim for the $4,093 resistance \u2014 its highest level since December 2021. The $3,605 level may serve as a good support level in case the bullish momentum cools.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, many expect ETH to see more significant gains in the coming weeks as it's barely performed in this cycle compared to previous cycles. Additionally, spot ETH ETF inflows after potential issuers' S-1 approvals would help boost ETH price to a new all-time high above $4,878."

        "title": "Analyst Says Ethereum Flippening Bitcoin Is Only A Matter Of Time: Here's Why - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In 2017-2018, the debate was whether Tron would surpass Ethereum to second place. But, looking at how things have evolved, the debate has been settled.\n\nEthereum is the most dominant smart contracts platform. However, this has not prevented analysts from comparing Bitcoin and the world\u2019s most valuable altcoin.\n\nWill ETH Finally Flip BTC?\n\nTaking to X, one user claims that Ethereum only needs time to flip Bitcoin as the crypto leader. Citing multiple factors, the analyst said Ethereum is better placed to take over from the first cryptocurrency, pointing to, among others, the larger user base and the benefits smart contracts bring to the equation.\n\nLooking at CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.3 trillion, with each coin trading for over $68,000 at spot rates when writing on May 28. Meanwhile, Ethereum is perched at second.\n\nAlthough it has been one of the top performers in the last week, stretching gains versus Bitcoin, each coin is changing hands for over $3,800. It has a market cap of over $465 billion at this level.\n\nComparing the two, Bitcoin is roughly three times more valuable than Ethereum. Even with the larger market cap, derived from its first mover advantage, one analyst thinks Ethereum is superior.\n\nFor instance, the observer said Ethereum has a significantly larger user base than Bitcoin. The broader user base is because developers can launch protocols on the platform. Some of the most popular ones, like Uniswap and Aave, generate more daily fees than Bitcoin.\n\nBesides this, the analyst said Ethereum serves as a store of value and a medium of exchange. These features give it more edge than Bitcoin, which purely exists as a transactional layer for moving value trustlessly and cheaply across borders.\n\nFrom an infrastructure perspective, the analyst argues that being an Ethereum validator is easier than running a Bitcoin mining rig. Over 1.9 million Ethereum validators have staked at least 32 ETH for a chance to validate a block of transactions and earn rewards. On the other hand, Bitcoin mining requires specialized hardware. Mining rigs are usually expensive and scarce.\n\n\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Listings Approval And The Security Question\n\nWhile the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing is bullish, whether ETH is a security or a commodity remains to be clarified. Bitcoin, by comparison, enjoys a clearer designation as a commodity.\n\nThe United States SEC has not explicitly declared ETH a security. However, ConsenSys recently sued the agency, claiming they considered ETH a security internally. There is a clash since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a sister agency to the SEC, categorizes ETH as a commodity.\n\nEven as the debate rages on, analysts claim it would be endorsing ETH as a commodity if the commission approves form S-1 for registration.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in an event christened \u201cThe Merge.\u201d The transformation came as the network wanted to achieve more security, cut down on energy consumption by 99.95%, and execute new scaling solutions with a possible threshold of 100,000 transactions per second. With PoS, there are less entry barriers for miners considering the reduced energy demands.\n\nStaking is a process where investors grow their portfolios by locking their assets for a specified duration instead of selling them. It is used by most blockchains, especially the ones that employ Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, with users earning rewards as an incentive for committing their tokens. For most long-term cryptocurrency holders, staking is a strategy to make passive income from your assets, putting them to work in exchange for reward generation.\n\nEthereum uses decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that are independent of the central authority. To make this easier, the network has a programming language in place, which helps users create self-executing smart contracts. A smart contract is basically a code that can be verified and allows inter-user transactions.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Serving as the basal network for the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, it is the second largest crypto and largest altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, attributes that make it popular among developers.\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,837 on Tuesday as it enters a sideways movement. While current price movement suggests bulls may be running out of steam, it may also indicate a temporary slowdown until the market receives clarity on conversations surrounding the spot ETH ETF S-1 approvals.\n\nEthereum (ETH) followed a sideways trend on Tuesday as the crypto community seems to favor the term 'programmable money' as ETH's one-liner.

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: Here\u2019s When It Could Officially Launch - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "With the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States, all eyes are on when they will go live. Now, several experts have shared their predictions as to when the highly-anticipated investment offering could launch.\n\nThe crypto-based ETF follows Bitcoin as the second asset to be granted approval in the country. However, the ETH iteration of the product has yet to launch, with the market awaiting that moment. Subsequently, a few prominent crypto voices have given their best estimations on that impending moment and presented a timeline.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Michael Saylor Reacts To Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nExperts Predict When Spot Ethereum ETF Will Go Live\n\nOver the past several months, all eyes have been on the application process for Ethereum ETFs. The market had been awaiting a decision, with the SEC surprisingly switching its stance, and greenlighting the offering this month. However, it has not officially gone live, with the industry pondering a potential timetable.\n\nNow, several industry experts have discussed the Spot Ethereum ETFs and when a launch could officially take place. Specifically, Nate Geraci of the ETF Prime podcast discussed a timetable for the product\u2019s official arrival. In a post to X (formerly Twitter), Geraci said that \u201cnobody knows fo sure, but my expectation would be [the] next few weeks.\u201d\n\nGeraci stated that the launch of the Ethereum ETF would take place in \u201c2-3 months max.\u201d Additionally, he stated that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d was already done after Spot BTC ETFs debuted this year. Ultimately, he noted that a delay in trading depends on \u201chow long SEC wants to string this out.\u201d\n\nJuly 4th feels like a good over/under \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 28, 2024\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Is Effectively Deemed A Commodity: Coinbase Exec\n\nConversely, Bloomberg\u2019s Erich Balchunas has also discussed a trading timeline in response to Geraci. Specifically, Balchunas remarked, \u201cJuly 4th feels like a good over/under.\u201d Overall, it showcases that the industry is anticipating the launch to take place within the next two weeks.\n\nStill, for the product to officially go live, there is a requirement for S-1 approvals. This part of the process appears to be what is holding up the launch of the ETFs, as it is vital to the registration of securities with the SEC. Although the next several weeks appear to be an appropriate timeline, the process is still facing some uncertainties regarding its eventual launch."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 Approval Potential Date Revealed, Here\u2019s Everything - CoinGape",
        "content": "The potential S-1 approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs has become a hot topic within the crypto community. Hence, various industry experts have shared their insights on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might give the green light. Nate Geraci, host of the ETF Prime podcast, recently expressed that the S-1 approvals could come within a few weeks.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF S-1 Approval Potential Timeline\n\nIn a post on X, Geraci stated, \u201cWhen will SEC approve spot eth ETF registration statements? *Nobody* knows for sure, but my expectation would be next few weeks. 2-3 months max.\u201d Moreover, Geraci believes that the approval process for Spot Ethereum ETFs could be expedited owing to swift ETF approval for Bitcoin previously.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition, he argued that the SEC has already done much of the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d with the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum futures ETFs. Therefore, he suggests, it may just be \u201ca matter of how long SEC wants to string this out.\u201d\n\nWhilst, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, engaged with Geraci\u2019s post. He proposed a potential Ether ETF S-1 approval timeline around July 4, 2024. Balchunas stated, \u201cJuly 4th feels like a good over/under.\u201d Geraci concurred, adding, \u201cI like it\u2026 I\u2019ll take under, but right timeframe IMO.\u201d\n\nHence, it can be rightly said that the S-1 approvals could take more than a month for approval. Though the greenlight wouldn\u2019t be as swift as in the case of Bitcoin ETFs, it\u2019s still quite early considering the debate around Ethereum\u2019s status and other regulatory implications. Thus, there are very low chances of the commencement of Spot Ethereum ETF trading in the coming month.\n\nAlso Read: Why Is Ethereum Price Going Up? ETH Soars To $3,900 As ETF Hype Escalates\n\nReason For Delay In Launch\n\nThe above-mentioned exchange follows Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\u2019s detailed exposition on the approval process. Earlier, Seyffart emphasized the difference between SEC approval and the actual ETF launch. The 19b-4 filings for eight Spot Ethereum ETFs were approved on May 23.\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that the next critical step involves the approval of the S-1 forms, which might take longer. He explained, \u201cWe also need S-1 approvals. It could be weeks to months before we see S-1 approvals and thus a live Eth ETF.\u201d\n\nSeyffart highlighted the misconception that approval of the 19b-4 and S-1 forms would happen simultaneously, as it did with the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Moreover, he clarified that the SEC\u2019s approval of these forms typically involves a minimum time gap before the actual launch of the products.\n\nThis process requires bi-directional communication between the regulator and the applicants, a dynamic that only started this week. In the case of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, this interaction spanned several weeks. Given this context, the timeline for the approval and subsequent launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain.\n\nHowever, the optimism shared by experts like Geraci and Balchunas suggests that the financial community could see significant progress in the coming months. As Geraci noted, the SEC has already navigated the complexities of similar ETF approvals, which might streamline the current process for Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF Approvals Poised to Spur Long-Term Growth: Kaiko\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen a significant price surge over the past week, rising more than 27% and breaking out of a falling wedge chart pattern. This breakout suggests a potential reversal from the previous downtrend and hints at the possibility of Ether reaching new all-time highs.\n\n\n\nThe falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern when the price makes lower highs and lower lows within a converging downtrend. The breakout from this pattern indicates that selling pressure is waning, and buyers are gaining control. Additionally, Ether has flipped key resistance areas into support, providing a solid base for further gains.\n\n\n\nThe recent price surge in Ethereum has also been accompanied by a decline in Bitcoin's dominance, suggesting that traders' attention is shifting towards Ether. Bitcoin's dominance, which measures Bitcoin's market share relative to the overall cryptocurrency market, has fallen over 0.98% in the past five days, while Ethereum's dominance has risen 4.4%. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum's dominance has increased by 1.45%, while Bitcoin's dominance has decreased by 0.57%.\n\n\n\nAnalysts are also bullish on Ethereum's potential to continue its upward trajectory, with some predicting that the cryptocurrency could reach as high as $4,500 before the launch of the first spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\n\n\nArthur Cheong, the founder and CEO of crypto-focused investment firm DeFiance Capital, believes that Ether could rally to the $4,500 mark before the first spot Ether ETFs start trading. In a May 26 post, Cheong tweeted on X that \u201c4.5k before spot ETF go live for trading imo\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum's price outlook is primarily driven by the recent developments around the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. On May 20, Ether's price rose nearly 20% within a day, following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has U-turned on spot Ether ETFs, possibly due to political pressure.\n\n\n\nAs of May 28, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $3,800, with a market capitalisation of USD 463.51 billion.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "Ethereum ETF Approval Success! Is Now a Good Time to Invest in Ethereum?\n\nRuby Layram 28th May 2024\n\nReading Time: 5 minutes\n\nOn the 23rd of May, an Ethereum ETF received approval from the SEC. This was a pretty big deal in the crypto space and lead many investors to wonder whether now is a good time to invest in Ethereum.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF means that Ethereum assets can now be traded on stock exchanges. This makes Ethereum more accessible which could have a positive impact on the number of people who buy it.\n\nWhen more people buy, the price tends to go up!\n\nIn this post, we will explore whether or not Ethereum is a good investment to consider right now.\n\nAlthough the approval of the ETF was great news for the crypto, there are also some potential risks to consider before you make any decisions.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in and take a look at whether Ethereum is worth your attention in 2024!\n\nIf you\u2019re sitting there scratching your head, don\u2019t worry! We will also explain what an Ethereum ETF is and why the recent approval was important.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum ETF?\n\nAn Ethereum ETF is a fund that tracks the performance of Ethereum. Just like other exchange-traded products, Ethereum ETFs allow you to gain exposure to Ethereum without owning the underlying asset.\n\nRecently, the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs offered by BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Arc, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.\n\nThis means that investors will be able to invest in Ethereum through these brokerages via funds that track the underlying price.\n\nBut, what is Ethereum?\n\nIt\u2019s all very well explaining the ins and outs of an Ethereum ETF however, that won\u2019t get you anywhere if you don\u2019t understand Ethereum!\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency. More importantly, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap (after Bitcoin).\n\nThe token itself is actually called \u2018Ether\u2019 and \u2018Ethereum\u2019 is the blockchain network that it is built on.\n\nEthereum was created as a sustainable alternative to Bitcoin. It is much less energy-intensive, faster, and cheaper to run!\n\nDue to it\u2019s high speeds and scalability, Ethereum is used to build a LOT of applications in the web3 space. So, it\u2019s pretty important!\n\nAlso see: What is Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\n\nHow might the approval of an Ethereum ETF affect the price of Ether?\n\nCrypto analysts are very optimistic about the impact that the ETF will have on the price of Ethereum. In fact, the CEO of Jumper.Exchange recently revealed that the approval could lead to a price rally of up to 60%!\n\nThe main reason that the launch of an Ethereum ETF will have such a positive impact on the price of Ether is that it will make Ethereum more accessible.\n\nFurthermore, the approval of the ETF will generate positive market sentiment, which is never a bad thing!\n\nEssentially, Ethereum ETFs will encourage more investors to add Ethereum assets to their portfolios which could put upward pressure on the price.\n\nAlthough the ETF will not affect the price of Ethereum directly. There will be an increased purchasing of Ethereum by the ETFs which will affect the demand for the crypto.\n\nThe bulk of the rally is expected to occur shortly after the first Ethereum ETF is launched for trading. But, the event could also cause long-term growth for the crypto.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Ethereum?\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum ETF caused a surge of optimism around Ethereum. But, is it really a good time to invest?\n\nPast performance of crypto ETFs\n\nEthereum is not the first cryptocurrency to bag itself an ETF. Bitcoin did the same thing in January.\n\nOne good way to understand how Ethereum might respond to the ETF is to look at Bitcoin\u2019s performance.\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, the price of Bitcoin dropped after the initial ETF announcement in January. This was due to confusion, regulatory warnings, and investors taking short-term profits.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take long for the coin to experience a rally just weeks later. The initial drop was spurred by early investors bagging their profits and it took time for the effects of the ETF to kick in.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that some of the rally could have been due to the recent halving event. There is no such event in sight for Ethereum which means that it might not experience the same bullish gains as Bitcoin.\n\nAs for the Bitcoin ETFs themselves, they were relatively popular amongst investors. In particular, the iShares Bitcoin Trust managed to hit $10 billion is assets in just 2 months!\n\nThe popularity of crypto ETFs is likely to increase with the growing adoption of cryptocurrency. The assets are framed as the \u2018beginner-friendly\u2019 way to get into crypto.\n\nEthereum ETFs have the potential to be more appealing than Bitcoin ETFs due to the impact that Bitcoin mining has on the environment.\n\nEthereum price predictions\n\nThe cryptocurrency market attracts a lot of analysts who regularly share their price forecasts and predictions online. These can be a good way to understand what other people think of crypto.\n\nAccording to a price prediction published by Forbes, Ethereum has the potential to perform well this year. The blockchain network will undergo several major upgrades that will increase efficiency and make the network more attractive.\n\nThe price of Ethereum could also be influenced by macro-economic events (a fancy word for \u2018large scale events\u2019) such as the wider adoption of cryptocurrency, which seems to be growing each year!\n\nAs more people invest in crypto, the price of Ether is likely to move upwards. This is because it is the second-largest crypto by market cap and one of the most attractive options for investors.\n\nGrowing rates of adoption will also increase the demand for the Ethereum blockchain technology, which is used to power a significant number of applications and crypto products.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nWow, isn\u2019t that a lot of information to take in?\n\nIn a nutshell, I believe that now could be a good time to consider investing in Ethereum (and crypto in general).\n\nThis is because:\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs will attract new investors.\n\nEthereum is due to undergo a major upgrade later this year which will make the technology more attractive.\n\nEthereum will benefit from the wider adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it is also really important to be aware of the risks that are involved in buying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of crypto tokens can be highly volatile which means that the price can experience large movements in a short period of time. This makes it difficult to accurately predict future performance.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum also involves using exchanges that may not be regulated to the same extent that stock exchanges are. Try to stick to reputable platforms that have positive reviews and follow strict security measures.\n\nAlthough many people believe that the future of Ethereum is positive, there is no guarantee that the value of your investment will go up. The price of Ethereum could drop if investor sentiment turns negative and demand takes a hit.\n\nTo learn more about investing sign up for our fortnightly MoneyMagpie Investing Newsletter.

        "content": "After the US SEC asked exchanges to fine-tune their Ether ETF filings, market experts are almost certain that approval is on the way. Just like it was with Bitcoin, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to be the next big thing in the crypto market.Standard Chartered, agreeing that Ethereum will receive the green light for spot ETFs soon, has updated its price target for the leading altcoin. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research, believes ETH could peak at $8,000 by the end of the year.According to Geoff Kendrick, spot Ethereum ETFs will drive inflows of $15 billion to $45 billion within the first 12 months. This inflow of capital is what is expected to be the driving force behind the next major move in the crypto market.Ethereum undoubtedly could play a massive role in this year\u2019s crypto winter, but there are other cryptos that are set to record bigger gains.

The KangaMoon community has quickly grown to over 32,000, and over $7 million has been raised to create the most community-centric project.The aim of the project is simple: building and rewarding a lively community of people with similar interests in crypto games, meme culture, and engagements. Social-Fi, a new protocol, will power KangaMoon to reward users based on their level of engagement.KangaMoon has also partnered with RaidSharks to launch a community engagement bot that will add more flavour to the ecosystem. In addition, KangaMoon features a metaverse, \u2018Kangaverse\u2019 where players will be able to play selected crypto games, develop as well as level up their characters, and sell them for money.The unique approach of KangaMoon has made it a favourite in the crypto community. The price of KANG, its native token, has already increased by 400% this year to hit $0.025. The potential surge to $1 makes KANG the best crypto investment of the year.The decentralised oracle network Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top altcoins with a very bullish outlook in 2024. According to the pseudonymous trader, Immortal , all LINK needs to do to prepare for a massive price increase is remain above the $16 support level.The Chainlink price has held this support level since recovering it in mid-May. According to Immortal\u2019s analysis, LINK could explode to $28 by September. However, the long-term Chainlink price prediction suggests that LINK could hit $40 by December, levels the altcoin last recorded in May 2021.In a recent tweet, crypto exchange Bitget announced that it had listed VeChain (VET) on its platform. While the news has failed to spark a bullish move for VeChain, market analyst Crypto EA remains optimistic about the potential of VET this crypto summer.The analyst explained that VET recently touched the lower level of its Bollinger Bands (BB), resulting in the recent VeChain price pump. Based on his predictions, VET could target the higher level in this bull cycle. If VeChain follows through with this trend, the altcoin price could rise by at least 500% to hit $0.18. CryptoEA, however, believes VET could top out at $0.5 in this bull cycle.According to the pseudonymous analyst known as the Flow Horse, spot ETH ETFs would make the crypto markets \u2018get crazier.\u2019 While the ETH altcoin price could see a major pump in price, Flow Horse is even more bullish about Dogecoin (DOGE).He notes that Dogecoin has been \u2018sitting in a really nice area for long,\u2019 and could be activated by the ETF approval. Based on the chart shared by Flow Horse, the Dogecoin price could pump towards $0.60 this bull cycle, an increase of more than 4x from its current range at $0.1600.Chiliz (CHZ) is one of the top altcoins already benefiting from the momentum Ethereum has been building. According to Santiment, the leading blockchain platform focused on sports and entertainment, is one of the altcoins seeing a surge in whale activity. The surging whale activity comes as Naver Pay and the Chiliz enter into a partnership to launch exclusive ticketing and payment services.With the potential to increase the Chiliz crypto, whales seem very optimistic that the price of CHZ could be on the rise. From its current range at $0.120, a Chiliz price prediction suggests that CHZ could hit a yearly high of $0.60 before this bull cycle is over.With Ethereum predicted to experience the same kind of rally as Bitcoin did after its ETF approval, it\u2019s a no-brainer why ETH is one of the best coins to invest in now. However, while it could be the face of this crypto summer, predictions from experts suggest other altcoins will end up with bigger gains.Standard Chartered\u2019s $8,000 prediction suggests the price of ETH will increase by 2.1x before the end of the year. Meanwhile, CHZ and VET could see an increase of 5x, and DOGE a rise of 400%. However, the best crypto investment for this year remains KANG, with a potential rise of 50x.While ETH prepares to lead another crypto bull market, LINK, CHZ, VET, and DOGE are some of the topcoins to invest in for bigger returns. Meanwhile, the top option remains KangaMoon as its unique new platform could fuel the biggest rally of the year.Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!The above content is non-editorial, and TIL (Times Internet Limited) hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s crypto whale holdings increased 27% in 14 months - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The past few months have been marked by an uptick in ETH whale activity.\n\nSince the SEC approved ETH spot ETF, there has been a rally in daily whale transfers.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has witnessed a surge in whale activity in the past few months, Santiment noted in a newly published report.\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, the recent uptick in whale activity has been fueled by rumors and the eventual approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOn the 23rd of May, the regulator approved 19b-4 forms for the ETF applications filed by BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.\n\nThis approval came unexpectedly after an extended refusal to communicate with issuers.\n\nETH whales take charge\n\nPer Santiment\u2019s report, over the past 14 months, whale wallets that hold at least 10,000 ETH coins have increased their cumulative holdings by 27%.\n\nThis cohort of ETH holders bought 21.39 million ETH, valued at $83 billion, at current market prices during that period.\n\nAccording to Santiment,\n\n\u201cEthereum has even gained on Bitcoin (by percentage) over the past month after the rumors and eventual approval of the first Spot ETH ETFs were announced by the SEC. So it\u2019s no surprise to see that the whale accumulation has not come to an end.\u201d\n\nRegarding daily whale transactions involving ETH, the on-chain data provider noted that after last week\u2019s spot ETF approval, the number of ETH whale transactions exceeding $100,000 and $1 million surged to YTD highs.\n\nOn that day, the number of ETH transactions valued above $100,000 reached 7,649, while those exceeding $1 million totaled 1,252.\n\nThis surge was due to an uptick in profit-taking activity among the coin\u2019s large holders. Santiment noted,\n\n\u201cThis was clearly an opportunity that whales saw to profit take. However, prices may continue to outperform Bitcoin as long as these 10K+ ETH wallets are still moving north instead of south through this volatility.\u201d\n\nETH holders book gains\n\nAmid the growth in whale activity since last week\u2019s approval, daily transactions involving ETH have been profitable.\n\nAMBCrypto assessed the daily ratio of the altcoin\u2019s transaction volume in profit to loss (using a seven-day moving average) and found that it was 1.87.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis meant that for every ETH transaction that ended in a loss in the last week, 1.87 transactions returned a profit.\n\nAt press time, the altcoin exchanged hands at $3,865, according to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data."

        "title": "Ethereum: THIS can majorly impact ETH\u2019s $5K price prediction - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Exchange inflow reached January highs, putting the ETH\u2019s price at risk.\n\nThough the reward ratio dropped, a key indicator suggested that ETH could rally above $4,700.\n\nAlmost six months since it last hit the highest exchange inflow, Ethereum [ETH] is back in the same situation, sparking speculations that the price could swing lower.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s price was $3,874. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the exchange inflow was as high as 140,660 on the 25th of May.\n\nWhile the inflow has not shed much, AMBCrypto\u2019s deep-dive into the rabbit suggested that the bullish prediction might not come as fast as market participants expected.\n\nIs a new low coming?\n\nThis is because the high flow of cryptocurrencies into the exchange is a sign of increased selling pressure. As such, it might be challenging for Ethereum to hit a higher price unless the pressure slows down.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s investigation showed that the rise in the sale of the altcoin could be linked to its recent price increase. A few days ago, ETH\u2019s value was over $3,900. This was a 16.82% rise in the last 30 days.\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum spot ETFs fueled this hike. But the asset was not trading live yet. However, many opinions suggested that ETH\u2019s price could rally past $4,500 or hit $5,000 once the ETFs go live.\n\nIf selling does not stop by that time, this prediction could slip away from the heavyweight in the short term. To assess this, AMBCrypto looked at Ethereum\u2019s Sharpe Ratio.\n\nThis ratio shows the risk-adjusted performance of an asset. If the reading of the Sharpe Ratio is negative, it means that the asset involved is producing bad returns for holders.\n\nBetween 1 and 1.99 is considered a good risk-to-reward ratio. Should the reading rise above 3, it means that the cryptocurrency is offering good returns relative to the risk of investment.\n\nAccording to Messari, the metric hit a ceiling of 3.62 on the 27th of May. But at press time, the ratio has declined to 2.98, indicating the returns were no longer excellent but at a moderate pace.\n\nThe bull phase might start from $4,713\n\nShould the reading continue to fall, so will ETH\u2019s price. However, the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency remained extremely promising.\n\nAMBCrypto gathered this after examining the Pi Cycle Top indicator. This metric uses the 111-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 350-day SMA to check if prices have hit an overheated point.\n\nFor Ethereum, using Glassnode\u2019s data, the 111 SMA (green) was below the 350 SMA (purple). This suggests that the price has the potential to trade higher.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAssuming a crossover of the shorter SMA over the longer one appeared, it would have spelled doom for ETH.\n\nIn addition, the indicator revealed that ETH\u2019s price could hit $4,713 once the selling pressure fizzles out. Should this forecast come to pass, then the value could attempt testing $5,000."

        "content": "A month and a half after we first observed that the world's largest bitcoin fund, Grayscale's GBTC, had lost more than half of its assets since the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January in what was the year's first, and far less memorable \"halving\" event...\n\n... and just over a week after Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenschein unexpectedly resigned amid persistent, relentless outflows (courtesy of GBTC's 1.5% in fees), the flipping has officially taken place.\n\nWith today's ETF flows now in the books, the inevitable has finally happened, and after GBTC saw $105.2 million, or about 1530 bitcoin, withdrawn in its biggest one-day outflow in more than two weeks, while BlackRock's IBIT added $101.9 million, the latter has now surpassed the former, and Blackrock's IBIT has dethroned GBTC as the world's largest ETF with $19.795 billion in bitcoin, equivalent to roughly 288,670 bitcoin, vs $19.758 billion for GBTC.\n\nAnd so having taken over the crown as the world's largest bitcoin ETF, Larry Fink can focus on the one asset he is truly after in his pursuit of financial tokenization - ether - which just got spot ETF approval late last week, and which Blackrock will very soon dominate as the 2nd largest cryptocurrency sets off in its trek to hit $14,000 some time in 2025 with Larry Fink's blessing.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Yesterday, ENS Labs, the company responsible for managing the decentralized service Ethereum Name Service, presented a governance proposal where it invites the community to expand its dapp into a layer-2 network.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know anything about the prototype of the network that ENS aspires to migrate to: all we know is that as a fundamental criterion the new chain must be EVM compatible, censorship-resistant, decentralized, and open source.\n\nAnche il money market Aave e la piattaforma di restaking Etherfi stanno pensando di tuffarsi nel panorama dei layer-2 lanciando una rete proprietaria.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nENS wants to launch its own layer-2 blockchain\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS), protocol for the creation of domini on the Ethereum blockchain, is considering migrating to a layer-2 to address some technical limitations and improve the end-user experience.\n\nQuesto \u00e8 quanto riportato da ENS Labs, organizzazione non-profit situata a Singapore che si occupa dello sviluppo della piattaforma ENS, che con una proposal di governance ha condiviso ieri l\u2019idea con la community del progetto.\n\nWithout revealing too many details, the company emphasized the potential benefits that would be brought to the protocol, such as improved scalability with reduced gas fees and the introduction of new advanced features.\n\nIl nuovo layer-2 dovr\u00e0 essere necessariamente compatibile con lo standard EVM, oltre che resistente alla censura, decentralizzato e open source.\n\nIntroducing ENSv2: The Next Generation of ENS \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nENS Labs is excited to announce our proposal to extend the ENS protocol to a Layer 2 network. This move isn't just about migrating parts of the protocol; we're re-envisioning the architecture from the ground up! pic.twitter.com/3xM6owTpKk \u2014 ens.eth (@ensdomains) May 28, 2024\n\nIn the world of finance, the terms \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d are often used to describe market trends. A \u201cbull\u201d market is characterized by rising prices and investor optimism, while a \u201cbear\u201d market is marked by falling prices and investor pessimism. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the financial markets effectively.\n\nSince 2017 ENS has established itself as the leading platform for on-chain domain registration, effectively becoming the bridge between traditional internet and the decentralized web.\n\nWith the passage of time, however, the ambitions of this protocol have also changed, which now in order to truly become mainstream aims to offer lower gas costs than Ethereum fees and faster transactions.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is indeed excessively expensive to use when there is too much congestion, skyrocketing the commission costs to execute a simple transaction or approve a smart contract.\n\nIf the proposal is accepted by the community, the domain registration phase will move to layer-2, which will become the new platform for user interactions in all respects.\n\nWith the update, a new hierarchical system is also proposed for more effective management of domini, where the holders of these resources will have access to a unique register, where they can check the subdomains and configure the resolvers.\n\nFurthermore, the transition to ENSv2 implies the improvement of l\u2019interoperabilit\u00e0 multi-chain, with the functions of ENS that will also be brought within other cryptographic ecosystems.\n\nWe still do not know the timing of this fundamental transition in the history of Ethereum Name Service, but it is likely that the migration could take place in 2025, provided the proposal passes.\n\nRegarding the news Eskender Abebe, Product and Strategy Manager at ENS Labs, reiterated how the release of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844 which introduced the function of BLOB in Ethereum rollups with Dencun, was a factor of enormous importance that motivated the team to evaluate the transition to layer-2, effectively making transactions on these second-level networks cheaper. These are his words:\n\n\u201cThe release of EIP4844 has made Ethereum-based layer 2 networks much more convenient and scalable, which has been a major driving factor for the ENS proposal.\u201d\n\nAave and Etherfi also consider a proprietary layer2 network\n\nENS non sarebbe l\u2019unico top protocollo della blockchain di Ethereum a pensare ad una migrazione presso un layer-2 pi\u00f9 scalabile: dopo il recente successo del trend delle soluzioni di ridimensionamento zk-rollup e degli optimistic rollup, con il TVL di questa nicchia che ha superato i 47 miliardi di dollari, sempre pi\u00f9 entit\u00e0 puntano a lanciare la propria chain con appoggio su Ethereum.\n\nOne of these is Aave, a very famous lending protocol that should soon complete the upgrade to Aave V4 with the platform aiming to introduce a unified multi-chain liquidity layer, becoming much more efficient in all respects.\n\nThe founder of the project, Stani Kulechov, in a recent post on X informed his community that after the V4 Aave could launch its own layer-2 network expanding its DeFi ecosystem towards new horizons.\n\nWe remind you that Aave represents the third largest dapp on Ethereum after EigenLayer and Lido, with a TVL of 13 billion dollars: if it landed on an L2, it would effectively become the largest secondary network on Ethereum, even beating the industry leader Arbitrum.\n\nIt would simultaneously also be the third largest chain in the entire Defi sector, behind Tron and obviously the parent company Ethereum.\n\nWe do not know the technical details of the new product but we know that the official launch is scheduled for 2025.\n\nThis is not a drill, Aave Network is planned to come after V4. https://t.co/a43nNlT114 \u2014 Stani^ (@StaniKulechov) May 27, 2024\n\n\u201c`html\n\nAnche EtherFi, noto protocollo di restaking di ultima generazione con un TVL di 6 miliardi di dollari, ha in programma di costruire un layer-2 proprietario in futuro.\n\n\u201c`\n\nAfter achieving enormous results in the market, such as the introduction of native restaking on L2s, the launch of its own token as an airdrop, and the release of a debit card to collateralize the balance in the protocol by borrowing USDC, now EtherFi aims for the next step.\n\nEven here, the details of this step are not known, except that it could likely happen in 2025, contributing to making user transactions much faster and cheaper.\n\nThe objective for the protocol is to improve the user experience and expand its connections with the DeFi landscape, aiming to attract as many resources and liquidity as possible."

        "content": "If Grayscale\u2019s Ether Trust (ETHE) follows a similar pattern, it could experience average daily outflows of US$110 million, constituting 30% of ETH\u2019s average daily volume on Coinbase. ETHE, with an AUM of US$11 billion, is currently trading at a discount to its net asset value (NAV). This discount has been narrowing since the SEC signaled approval for spot Ether ETFs on May 23.\n\nOn May 1, ETHE traded at a 25% discount, which narrowed to a 1.28% discount by May 24 amid speculation and eventual partial approval by the SEC. Similar to GBTC, ETHE is expected to see outflows once it becomes a spot ETF as the discount narrows further."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) recently approved the much-anticipated spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nThe development was celebrated by the crypto industry as it is generally accepted to be a positive development for the crypto market and the industry in all. But despite the approval, the price of Ethereum in the market has remained unchanged with that of Bitcoin even dropping further.\n\nThere are two major reasons for the lack of market activity in response to the just approved spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe reasons why the much-anticipated Ethereum ETF approval has so far had little impact on the prices of crypto assets are:\n\nEarly buyers\n\nThe news about the potential approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs has been on for a while now with the body language of the US regulatory body showing signs of a positive outcome.\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, updated his possibility meter for a spot Ethereum ETF approval from 25% to 75%.\n\nThis and other positive predictions from crypto analysts and experts spurred traders who were looking to cash in on the development to buy Ethereum earlier in the week long before the deadline for the SEC approval.\n\nEther\u2019s price surged 29% over the past week as a result of this flurry of activities\n\nThe current news of the much-anticipated approval finally happening is having little effect on the markets because all the actions by traders who wanted to buy the approval have already happened.\n\nS-1 form delay\n\nAnother reason why the current approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has had little impact on the price of Ethereum and other crypto markets is that although the approval has been confirmed, the process is still incomplete and investors cannot currently engage with the ETFs.\n\nWhat was approved recently were the 19b-4s forms issued by the Ethereum ETF issuers and not the S-1 forms.\n\nThe S-1 form is a comprehensive document including details of the firm\u2019s financials and risk profile as well as the securities it intends to offer.\n\nThe S-1 forms are yet to be approved by the SEC and could take weeks or even months.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThis means that trading in Ethereum ETF is yet to begin and that could be the explanation for the lack of market activity.\n\nHowever, some analysts say it might not immediately lead to an upward trend, citing Bitcoin\u2019s cycle to a price surge after its ETF was launched.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price dropped 15% after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading on Jan. 10. According to CoinMarketCap data, it took 30 days for the price to spike 30% to $51,870.\n\nEthereum price has remained in the range of $3800 to $3706 following the approval of its ETFs by the United States SEC. The article above highlighted reasons for that.\n\nNairametrics earlier reported that crypto analyst Andrey Stoychev has predicted that Ethereum\u2019s price could hit $10k if it succeeds in getting the spot Ethereum Exchange approved.\n\nThis would mean Ethereum beating its all-time high of over $4,800. That remains to be seen as Bitcoin did not immediately witness a price surge after its ETFs were approved and Ethereum\u2019s price has remained unchanged since its ETFs were approved last night."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent retracement follows a significant price rally, with ETF approvals seen as bullish.\n\nMarket volatility and trading activity suggest a complex, potentially bullish future for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum [ETH], a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain platform, has shown significant market activity in recent weeks.\n\nAfter a notable rally of approximately 31.5% over two weeks, raising its value to over $3,900, Ethereum has experienced a slight retracement, settling around $3,845.\n\nThis fluctuation comes amidst broader market movements and regulatory developments that may influence the asset\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nCrypto research firm Kaiko has shed light on these developments, particularly focusing on the potential impact of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThis approval is seen as a positive step for Ethereum, despite potential short-term market adjustments.\n\nThe implications of such regulatory advancements extend beyond immediate price effects, potentially shaping Ethereum\u2019s position in the financial markets and influencing investor sentiment significantly.\n\nEthereum: Market reactions\n\nKaiko\u2019s analysis reveals that the introduction of Ethereum ETFs might initially trigger selling pressure due to potential outflows from existing investment vehicles like Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE).\n\nThe firm currently manages over $11 billion in assets.\n\nHistorical data from similar scenarios suggested that such outflows could significantly impact daily trading volumes.\n\nHowever, as witnessed with Bitcoin ETFs, initial outflows were eventually offset by subsequent inflows, indicating a possible stabilization post-ETF launch.\n\nWill Cai, Head of Indices at Kaiko, emphasized the broader implications of the SEC\u2019s decision, noting it as a declaration of Ethereum\u2019s commodity status rather than a security.\n\nThis classification not only affects Ethereum\u2019s trading and custody but also sets a precedent for the regulation of similar tokens in the U.S., likely fostering a more stable regulatory environment.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Kaiko, the market depth of Ethereum on centralized exchanges stood at approximately $226 million at the time of the report \u2013 42% lower than levels before the FTX collapse.\n\nOnly 40% of this is focused on U.S. exchanges, a decrease from about 50% seen in early 2023.\n\nThe research firm noted:\n\n\u201cOverall, even if inflows disappoint in the short term the approval has important implications for ETH as an asset, removing some of the regulatory uncertainty which has weighed on ETH\u2019s performance over the past year.\u201d\n\nVolatility insights\n\nFurther insights from Kaiko highlighted Ethereum\u2019s volatility trends. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s Implied Volatility surged dramatically in late May, indicating heightened market activity and investor interest.\n\nThis was accompanied by an inversion in the volatility structure, where short-term volatility exceeded long-term expectations\u2014a common indicator of market stress or significant trading activity.\n\nIn derivatives markets, Ethereum has shown remarkable dynamics.\n\nThe Funding Rates for Ethereum\u2019s perpetual Futures experienced a sharp increase from their lowest in over a year to a multi-month high within just a few days.\n\nConcurrently, Open Interest in these futures reached a record $11 billion, suggesting robust capital inflows and increased trading activity.\n\nDespite these promising signs, some metrics suggest caution.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data indicated a recent decline in the number of new Ethereum addresses, which could signify a slowdown in new participant inflow to the network.\n\nHowever, our look at Ethereum\u2019s daily chart revealed that the asset recently converted a major resistance level into support, potentially setting the stage for further gains and possibly breaching the $4,000 mark."
