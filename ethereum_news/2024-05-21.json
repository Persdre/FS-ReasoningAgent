        "title": "SEC hints at last-second approval of Ethereum ETFs, but \u2018no issuer is ready\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "It was looking like an all-but-certain rejection from the Securities and Exchange Commission, but just hours before a May 23 deadline to rule on VanEck\u2019s application to launch a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund, it appears that the SEC may be reconsidering.\n\nCoinDesk first reported on Monday that the nine would-be issuers that filed to list and trade shares of the ETFs were \u201cabruptly\u201d asked by regulators to update their 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis. A 19b-4 form is what an exchange like the NYSE requires for the introduction of new products\u2014in other words, the applicants and the exchange are asking the SEC for permission to add the ETFs to their platforms.\n\nSince rumors began swirling on Monday afternoon, the price of Ether has shot up nearly 20%, trading near $3,750 around 1:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nIt's hard to believe this SEC would do us any favors like approving the spot ETH ETF.\n\n\n\nBut policy is politics, and crypto has been winning the political battle for months.\n\n\n\nMaybe the Biden camp saw how many voters Trump could win with one pro-crypto comment and decided to pivot. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) May 21, 2024\n\nAs VanEck is the first exchange to have filed an application, it receiving approval hypothetically would be a green light for others waiting to hear about their own 19b-4s. As chatter began to circulate on Monday that the applications were evolving, Bloomberg analysts updated their odds of an approval from 25% to 75%.\n\nBut the news has left issuers scrambling. Each issuer that James Seyffart, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, has spoken with has been \u201ccaught off guard by the SEC\u2019s 180-degree pivot,\u201d he told Fortune. The agency reached out to filers with comments and requested updates just three days before the deadline, he explained.\n\n\u201cThis is not standard operating procedure, and everyone from issuers to exchanges to lawyer, to market makers, and more, are scrambling to be ready for a potential approval\u2014and to meet the SEC\u2019s requirements,\u201d Seyffart adds. The rushed nature of the pivot suggests it was likely a \u201cpolitical move,\u201d the result of a \u201ctop-down decision\u201d from the Biden administration, he speculates. \u201cNo issuer is ready,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nIt's hard to believe this SEC would do us any favors like approving the spot ETH ETF.\n\n\n\nBut policy is politics, and crypto has been winning the political battle for months.\n\n\n\nMaybe the Biden camp saw how many voters Trump could win with one pro-crypto comment and decided to pivot. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) May 21, 2024\n\nSo far, Grayscale is the only would-be issuer to post an updated 19b-4 to the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s website, for its application to transfer over its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. Meanwhile, Fidelity has dropped its plans to stake the Ether in its ETF, according to an S-1 update filed to the SEC early Tuesday. In previous filings, the firm said it intended to \u201cstake a portion of the trust\u2019s assets\u201d to \u201cone or more\u201d infrastructure providers, but now it will \u201cnot stake the Ether\u201d stored with the custodian.\n\nStaking involves committing Ether to secure the network in return for yield, which is currently at about 3%, according to data from staking service Lido. Ark and Franklin Templeton also have considered staking in their applications. In today\u2019s updated 19b-4 from Grayscale, the firm confirmed it will not participate in staking. Both Grayscale foregrounding this and Fidelity omitting it suggests the SEC may have requested staking be prohibited. Vance Spencer, cofounder of Framework Ventures, told Fortune he estimates that the SEC\u2019s last-minute requests included guidance on staking.\n\nStaking the underlying Ether in the ETF has been a regarded as a reason why the SEC could reject applications, as Chairman Gary Gensler voiced concern last March that digital assets using staking protocols could be considered securities under federal law. Staking could be \u201ca significant complication,\u201d Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan previously told Fortune.\n\nHowever, even if the SEC approves VanEck\u2019s 19b-4 on Thursday, it doesn\u2019t guarantee authorization, as the exchanges will need issuers\u2019 S-1 applications before products begin trading. When applying to launch a new security, an S-1 is the form that outlines to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens.\n\nBut S-1s could take \u201cweeks to months\u201d to approve, Seyffart wrote on X. \u201cThat said, if we\u2019re correct and we see these theoretical approvals later this week. It should mean that S-1 approvals are a matter of \u2018When\u2019 not \u2018If.'\u201d"

That's a positive sign ahead of decision deadlines for at least two spot ETFs, one from VanEck and the other from Ark 21Shares.\n\nThe odds of approval, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, jumped to 75% from 25% in a single day on Monday. Meanwhile, odds of approval by May 31 have risen to 61% from 10% on the Polymarket betting platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Standard Chartered Head of FX Research Geoff Kendrick, ETF approvals would cement ether's chances of reaching $8,000 by this year's end.\n\nThe bullish forecast is one he's held since March, arguing that the funds' approval would drive $15 billion to $45 billion worth of inflows into the token. Eventually, ether could hit $14,000 by end-2025, he reiterated in new research on Tuesday.\n\nFurther, the ETFs would largely avoid the same situation as bitcoin funds, which have seen outflows and considerable price swings after an initial boom period, he added.\n\nFor one, Kendrick says inflow volatility will be minimal because ether lacks investment alternatives that could compete with the ETFs, such as a Microstrategy equivalent. This company's massive hoard of bitcoin means that its stock move in line with the token.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecondly, big outflows are also less likely to be an issue for ether, Kendrick pointed out. This was a challenge for bitcoin after its ETFs hit markets, as the funds became as major competitor to the pre-existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, leading to a bout of selling.\n\n\"The ETH Grayscale trust is smaller in percent of market cap than the BTC one was, so any forced selling as occurred with BTC post ETF approval should be less important,\" Kendrick said in written commentary.\n\nOnce ether funds are established, the price highs that it can achieve bode well for bitcoin, Kendrick added. Already, the apex token has jumped as much as 6.7% this week on the back of ether's gains.\n\n\"An ETH ETF approval will further legitimise the sector and therefore be BTC positive as well. I would expect a fresh all-time high in BTC by the weekend (through the 14 March USD 73,798 level),\" Kendrick wrote."

        "title": "Ethereum Soars As SEC Reconsiders Spot Ether ETF Approval - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Ethereum Soars As SEC Reconsiders Spot Ether ETF Approval\n\nThe price of Ethereum jumped 18% as the SEC reconsiders its position on the approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF.\n\nOn Monday, new developments suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be rethinking its stance on spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have indicated a shift in the SEC\u2019s approach, raising the odds of approval from 25% to 75% after \u201chearing chatter\u201d about the financial regulator\u2019s internal discussions.\n\nAnalysts Adjust Predictions\n\nOn Monday Seyffart and Balchunas posted on X to update their predictions regarding the SEC\u2019s decision on spot Ether ETFs. \u201cThe SEC might be doing a 180 on their expected denial of spot Ether exchange-traded funds this week,\u201d wrote Balchunas. This new perspective is based on various signals, including recent SEC filings, public statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and insider reports suggesting that the commission might be leaning towards approval following political pressure on Democrats to reverse course on crypto.\n\nSeyffart echoed this sentiment, mentioning that the issue had become \u201cincreasingly political.\u201d He hinted at a surge of related filings in the coming days if their sources were correct. \u201cNever gonna hear the end of this from the [Ether] people in my replies if this turns out to be true,\u201d Seyffart remarked, highlighting the potential impact on the cryptocurrency community.\n\nUpcoming Deadlines and Broader Implications\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on VanEck\u2019s spot Ether ETF is due by May 23. This decision is critical as VanEck\u2019s application is the first in a series of pending spot Ether ETFs, including those from ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity. The SEC has already delayed VanEck\u2019s application as long as allowed under regulatory guidelines, setting the stage for a potentially groundbreaking decision.\n\nEthereum soared to $3,636 on the news\n\nIn an April interview, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed skepticism about the SEC\u2019s approval of his company\u2019s ETF application in May. This skepticism seemed justified when Grayscale withdrew its application for an Ether futures ETF on May 7, followed by CEO Michael Sonnenshein\u2019s resignation announcement on May 20 (Cointelegraph).\n\nPolitical and Regulatory Dynamics\n\nThe evolving political landscape could also influence the SEC\u2019s decision. Recently, U.S. lawmakers in both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to overturn an SEC rule impacting banks dealing with companies holding digital assets. This congressional resolution\u2019s future remains uncertain, pending President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to either veto or sign it into law.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC has requested exchanges to update their 19b-4 filings, suggesting a potential move towards approving these applications. This request has led to speculation that the SEC might be progressing towards an approval decision. However, even if the 19b-4 filings are approved, the ETFs would still need their S-1 applications cleared before trading could commence, a process without a defined timeline.\n\nIndustry Reactions and Future Prospects\n\nOne company in talks with the SEC reported a more optimistic outlook, feeling that the regulatory body was no longer dragging its feet. This optimism is bolstered by the reassessment from Seyffart and Balchunas, who increased their approval odds based on new information and insider sources\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation into whether Ether qualifies as a security continues to add complexity to the situation. This investigation, launched after Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, could influence the SEC\u2019s final decision. A recent development from Prometheum, which launched its Ether custody service with plans to offer services for other digital assets considered securities, might also play a role in shaping the SEC\u2019s view.\n\nAs the May 23 deadline approaches, the financial and crypto communities are on high alert. The SEC\u2019s decision could significantly impact the market, setting a precedent for future cryptocurrency ETF approvals, taking crypto centre stage for the upcoming election cycle, and shaping the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States."

        "title": "Uniswap fights back against SEC as the ethereum crackdown continues - CNBC",
        "content": "watch now\n\nFor years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been cracking down on the crypto sector writ large, but in the last few months, the agency appears to have trained its sights on ethereum , in particular. Some of the biggest names in decentralized finance are now fighting back. In a 40-page filing Tuesday, Uniswap Labs \u2014 which builds decentralized finance infrastructure including a popular DeFi crypto exchange that enables users to custody their own coins \u2014 detailed to the SEC all the reasons why the agency shouldn't pursue legal action against them. It comes a few weeks after the commission issued Uniswap a Wells notice, warning the company that it identified potential violations of U.S. securities law. \"The SEC's entire case rests on the false assumption that all tokens are securities. Tokens are in fact, simply a file format for value,\" said Uniswap's chief legal officer, Marvin Ammori. \"The SEC has to essentially unilaterally change the definitions of exchange, broker and investment contract in order to try to capture what we do,\u201c Ammori said. A Wells notice is typically one of the final steps before the SEC formally issues charges. It generally lays out the framework of the regulatory argument and offers the potentially accused an opportunity to rebut the SEC's claims. So far this year, the federal regulator has sent Wells notices, filed lawsuits, or reached settlements with a host of crypto firms, and the SEC's legal challenges are increasingly focused on ethereum and players working in decentralized finance, including ShapeShift, TradeStation, Uniswap and Consensys. It also comes as the agency is reportedly investigating the Ethereum Foundation. CNBC reached out to the SEC about the recent batch of Wells notices sent to crypto firms, and an agency spokesperson declined to comment. In April, Consensys tried to preempt the SEC's action with its own lawsuit, alleging overreach on the part of the regulator. The 10-year-old crypto firm said its suit followed three subpoenas issued last year, plus a Wells notice from the SEC that claimed the company was violating federal securities laws. \"This action is about the almost certainty that we hold that the SEC is trying to slow or kill ethereum, decentralization, disintermediation and disintermediated technology in the U.S., and probably wouldn't stop there with its long arm,\" said long-time ethereum veteran Joseph Lubin, who went from co-founding the blockchain to launching and running Consensys. \"It might influence other nation-states to do similarly draconian things,\" continued Lubin.\n\nSecurity vs. commodity\n\nThe recent spate of actions targeting major names working in the ethereum ecosystem comes ahead of a long-awaited decision on whether the regulator will approve or deny applications to launch spot ether exchange-traded funds. To date, the agency's stance on ether's classification as either a commodity or a security remains uncertain. \"We think big banks like the way things are organized. We think certain factions of the U.S. government like the way they operate,\" said Lubin. \u201cWithout explicitly stating their intentions, without public discussion and clear rulemaking, the SEC seems to have decided to reclassify ether as a security without being able to utter that that's what they're doing.\" The industry argues if ether \u2014 the native token of the ethereum blockchain \u2014 gets classified as a security, it could throw the future of the ethereum network and many adjacent crypto firms into question. Exchanges, both centralized and decentralized, would be forced to choose between registering with the SEC, or delisting ether altogether. \"If the SEC, in fact, does take the position that ethereum is a security, pretty much everyone in this business that is using or providing services of the ethereum blockchain, they're going to be on notice that they might need to be registered,\" said digital assets attorney Christopher Gerold, who previously served as the chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities. \"Whatever protections they thought they had before are no longer going to be there, and we're going to see a shift in the industry,\" continued Gerold.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe head of litigation and investigations at Consensys told CNBC that the firm's been alarmed that the SEC has been targeting developers. \"They asked for a list of the names of any Consensys developers who contributed any coding to the merge,\" said Laura Brookover. The so-called merge was a years-in-the-making systemwide upgrade to the ethereum blockchain that took effect in September 2022 and changed the way transactions are verified. The proof-of-stake model, which replaced the proof-of-work model, requires volunteers on the network to put up their ether tokens, or \"stake\" them, in order to secure the network. Brookover says the agency has explicitly asked for the identities of public and private Consensys software developer code repositories. \"Those are very strange requests from a financial regulator,\" continued Brookover. \"I can speak to that, because I used to be in the CFTC's enforcement division and investigated cases myself.\" Multiple coders and industry executives have told CNBC that it is possible the SEC could be taking more of an interest in ethereum, because the regulator thinks its native token functions more like a security after the merge. Brookover told CNBC that the Consensys suit asks the court to declare both that ether is not a security and that the SEC lacks jurisdiction to investigate ethereum. Ultimately, the regulator will have to respond to the Consensys complaint in a legal filing. \"They're going to be hard pressed not to say in their answer whether they think ethereum is a security or not,\" said Gerold, adding that he suspects that the agency will take the position that it is a security because of the proof-of-stake change that took effect two years ago. One thing the SEC has been clear on is its classification of bitcoin as a commodity. With ether, the narrative has changed. In 2018, when Bill Hinman was still the director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporation Finance, he told CNBC that, \"When we look at bitcoin or if we look at ether and the highly decentralized nature of the networks, we don't see a third-party promoter where applying the disclosure regime would make a lot of sense.\" \"So we're comfortable ... viewing these as items that don't have to be regulated as securities,\" continued Hinman. In April 2023, when Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., asked SEC Chair Gary Gensler whether ether was a commodity or a security, Gensler demurred.\n\nwatch now\n\nSEC vs. crypto\n\nGensler has, in multiple interviews, repeatedly shared that he believes much of the industry already belongs under its jurisdiction, and its lawsuits are simply bringing the industry under compliance. Crypto firms argue that the recent legal battles haven't given the regulatory clarity the industry has been seeking for years. With the Uniswap Wells notice, for example, a source at the company told CNBC that dealing with the SEC was akin to \"talking to a wall.\" For two years preceding the Wells notice, Uniswap described the protracted interactions with the agency as an opaque process that involved responding to multiple requests, including giving testimony and sending several documents to the agency, without getting much feedback about the regulator\u2019s concerns around potential wrongdoing. This source also told CNBC they had not heard from the regulator at all in 2024 until the agency told them in a half-hour phone call that they would be receiving a formal notice.\n\nwatch now\n\nBoth Consensys and Uniswap suggest the SEC's broad approach to classifying securities may be outdated. \"The SEC is arguing that the Uniswap protocol is an unregistered securities exchange, and that the Uniswap interface and wallet are both unregistered broker brokers,\" Ammori said. But Uniswap argues that the protocol itself is a general purpose computer program that anyone can use and integrate. \"So the protocol is not an exchange also, because under the law, it would have to be specifically designed for securities trading, and it is not,\" continued Ammori. Uniswap argues in its response to the SEC that the majority of its trading volume is obvious nonsecurities, like ether, bitcoin and stablecoins. \"It's not run by a group, as the definition requires, but as autonomous software no person or group controls,\" added Ammori. \"The SEC knows that the current definition of exchange does not cover the protocol, or anything we do. That's why as we speak, there's a pending rulemaking, for the SEC is trying to redefine about a half dozen words in their own regulations to try to capture us,\" continued Uniswap's chief legal officer. Alma Angotti, partner and global legislative and regulatory risk leader at the consulting firm Guidehouse, cautions that it is less clear whether decentralized exchanges function like an alternative trading system, or a market maker \u2014 or whether they really are just a technology that does not act as a broker-dealer. Meanwhile, as the SEC ramps up its focus on decentralized players in the crypto ecosystem, centralized players also remain under scrutiny by the regulator. In May, investment platform Robinhood announced it received a Wells notice for the company's crypto operations. The SEC has also sued Coinbase and Binance. With multiple pending legal challenges from the regulator and enduring uncertainty about the future of crypto regulation in the U.S., multiple crypto businesses have said they are considering decamping from the country altogether. \"We've got companies that are wasting resources trying to figure out, 'Am I a broker-dealer? Are these assets securities?'\" said Binance's former chief compliance officer, Christina Rea. \"We're already having a hard enough time trying to get them to be compliant with other important laws \u2014 anti-money-laundering laws, anti-bribery and corruption laws.\" On Thursday, the commission will issue a decision on whether to approve one of the spot ether ETF applications after a multimonth delay. Many are waiting to see whether the regulator will offer clarity on its stance on ether. \u2014 CNBC's Jordan Smith contributed to this report."

        "content": "The SEC looks poised to approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nA significant portion of Ether is locked in staking, DeFi protocols, and DAOs.\n\nThe asset could experience a supply crunch.\n\nAfter months of radio silence, the Securities and Exchange Commission looks poised to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds after all.\n\nThe resulting \u201cfloodgate\u201d of demand for Ether will likely lead to a supply crunch, Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder and CEO of crypto infrastructure firm Consensys, told DL News.\n\nInstitutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin through the asset\u2019s freshly launched ETFs \u201cwill most likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF,\u201d Lubin said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether\u201d through the ETFs, he said, but there will be less supply to accommodate that demand than when the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s case, authorised participants \u2014 the firms contracted to buy Bitcoin on behalf of the ETFs every day new shares are created \u2014 could simply purchase idle coins on exchanges or through over-the-counter counterparties.\n\nBut onchain data shows that more than 27% of the total supply of Ether is already being staked across the Ethereum network. It\u2019s locked in contracts and earning a yield for its owners.\n\n\u201cMuch of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs,\u201d Lubin said, referring to decentralised autonomous organisations.\n\nIn other words, not only is Ether\u2019s market value lower than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 making Ether\u2019s price more reactive to inflows \u2014 but a significant portion of its supply is unavailable for ETF consumption.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOn top of that, renewed activity on Ethereum will cause the network to burn a substantial amount of the existing Ether supply over time, constraining supply further.\n\nEven in Bitcoin\u2019s case, banks were so desperate to purchase coins for the ETFs that they reached out to at least one major Bitcoin mining outfit to acquire some of its Bitcoin holdings, DL News learned. The supply crunch for Ethereum ETFs might be even bigger.\n\n\u201cThis could be a pretty profound watershed moment\u201d for Ethereum and the crypto industry as a whole, Lubin said.\n\nTom Carreras and Liam Kelly write about markets and DeFi for DL News.

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has now surpassed payments giant Mastercard by market capitalization ($440 billion and $427 billion, respectively).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made an apparent U-turn regarding the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund applications.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , Bloomberg analysts suddenly increased the approval odds to 75% despite previously capping them at just 25%. The reassessment was based on some chatter about the SEC rapidly changing its stance. Just days ago, the consensus was that VanEck's ETF filing was going to be shot down by the SEC due to the lack of engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, the SEC has asked exchanges to swiftly update their 19b-4 filings. The SEC could approve an Ethereum ETF as soon as this Wednesday.\n\nAlex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, claims that the SEC would recognize the underlying as a non-security while staked Ether would be considered to be a security. \"That would be somewhat congruent with their various court cases, as well as with reports about their various investigations, and perhaps allow SEC to approve Ethereum ETFs while maintaining their previously stated/arguing opinions,\" he added.\n\nThe price of the largest altcoin surged by as much as 16.2% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data . The price of Bitcoin has also added 6%, peaking at $71,650 earlier today.\n\nETH is still down 25.4% from its all-time high of $4,878 which was achieved two years ago."

        "title": "Experts speak out on how high Ethereum could go with an ETF approval - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Ethereum's price nears all-time high as ETF decision fuels market optimism.\n\nShare this article\n\nTomorrow is the final deadline for the approval of VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, and expectations are high. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement \u201cis happening,\u201d despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.\n\nJames Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s case was different. \u201cIn that instance, though, everything came together \u2013 ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly \u2013 and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,\u201d he shares.\n\nAlthough Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC\u2019s movement after the funds\u2019 approval. \u201cIt does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.\u201d\n\nRuslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. \u201cIf so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins\u2019 growth,\u201d added Lienkha.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was \u201ca sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.\u201d As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute \u2013 implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.\n\nMarko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH \u201cwell beyond its previous all-time high.\u201d Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.\n\nWhat if\u2026?\n\nDespite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn\u2019t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.\n\nNevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange\u2019s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.\n\n\u201cWhen the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,\u201d Jurina added.\n\nMoreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. \u201cEthereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.\u201d\n\nEven if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a \u2018layered\u2019 scenario, which could end in a \u201chard rejection\u201d or a \u201csoft rejection.\u201d A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.\n\n\u201cThe former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,\u201d Bitfinex analysts concluded."

        "title": "Ethereum rises 18% and Sen. Elizabeth Warren sinks in latest D.C. crypto drama - Fortune",
        "content": "Crypto markets got a jolt on Monday on news that the Securities and Exchange Commission has gone back to would-be issuers of Ethereum ETFs, asking them to update their filings. The move was widely interpreted as a signal the agency had suddenly gotten cold feet about its widely anticipated plan to reject the ETFs. In response, Ethereum rose from around $3,100 to over $3,700 by midnight, a gain of nearly 20% that also gave a boost to crypto prices across the board.\n\nThe reports of the request for new filings came three days before the SEC faces a final deadline to approve or reject an Ethereum ETF application from VanEck, one of the 11 companies that launched a first-of-its-kind ETF for Bitcoin in January. Those Bitcoin ETFs brought about a speculative frenzy that pushed the currency to an all-time high and, by all appearances, it looks like the markets are betting the good times will start up all over again, this time with Ethereum as the band leader.\n\nTo be clear, that SEC approval is far from a sure thing and, in any case, this week\u2019s VanEck decision only concerns a request to change agency rules to allow an Ethereum ETF\u2014even if the application is approved, VanEck and others will have to wait for weeks or months for the SEC to sign off on their corporate paperwork. But it\u2019s easy to forgive the crypto crowd for feeling optimistic and a little giddy given what else has happened in the last few days.\n\nFor starters, Monday also saw the Chairman of the FDIC, a powerful crypto opponent, resign in the wake of a scandal over a culture of toxicity and sexual harassment at the agency. Meanwhile, crypto boosters are still jubilant after a dozen Democrats in the Senate, including Majority Leader Charles Schumer, bucked their own party\u2019s position and voted for a bill that would make it easier for banks to hold crypto. While President Joe Biden said earlier that he would veto the bill, not everyone is sure about that following the Senate vote and a dawning realization among his party that crypto is more popular than people once thought.\n\nIf pro-crypto forces are the clear winners of this surprising series of developments in Washington, D.C., there is also an obvious loser: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The senior senator from the Bay State is not only the leader of her party\u2019s progressive wing, she has also long enjoyed an arrangement with the president that lets her dictate wide swaths of financial policy\u2014including its ferocious opposition to crypto. But in the past week, the Senate vote on the crypto bill shows her hold over policy is weakening. At the same time, she lost an important ally with the resignation of the FDIC chair\u2014whose job she fought to save. Warren\u2019s influence in her party is waning.\n\nOr if you prefer a shorter version of all this drama out of D.C., in the words of a crypto bro, the week can be summed up as \u201clong Ethereum, short Warren.\u201d\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nLongtime Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is stepping down to be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, head of strategy for asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs..

        "content": "What will an Ethereum ETF mean for the markets?\n\nGalaxy\u2019s Mike Novogratz and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin are among experts weighing in.\n\nEthereum shot up this week amid a swing to optimism about US approval for exchange-traded funds that track the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe reasoning behind the sudden U-turn is up for debate, but market watchers are generally aligned on what a regulator nod would do for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAsset manager VanEck is the first Ethereum ETF application on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s pile, due May 23.\n\nHere\u2019s what experts are saying.\n\nGalaxy\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\nA \u201cwidespread\u201d pivot in Washington in the last 24 hours just upended the Ethereum ETF game, said Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.\n\nIf the SEC\u2019s change of heart was politically motivated, \u201cthat\u2019s a seismic shift,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what actually happened, prices are going to be much higher than here.\u201d\n\nConsensys\u2019 Joe Lubin\n\nExpect a \u201cfloodgate\u201d of demand for Ether, which will likely lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher, says Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of crypto infrastructure firm Consensys.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nInstitutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin ETFs \u201cwill most likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF,\u201d Lubin told DL News.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether\u201d via ETFs, he said. He added the caveat that there will be less supply to accommodate that demand than when the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January.\n\nBitwise\u2019s Matt Hougan\n\n\u201dCrypto is in the process of going mainstream, and that this progress will push crypto to all-time highs,\u201d Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan wrote in a blog post this week.\n\nBut Hougan suggested that the catalyst was not the sudden optimism on ETFs.\n\n\u201dSomething remarkable happened in Washington: A bipartisan group of senators and representatives passed the first pro-crypto piece of legislation in Washington\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the bill to repeal the SEC\u2019s SAB 121 policy that imposed strict rules on crypto custody.\n\n\u201cThis newfound support for crypto in DC \u2014 whether we get the spot Ethereum approval or not \u2014 is the latest proof point,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nSwarm\u2019s Timo Lehes\n\nTimo Lehes, co-founder of blockchain platform Swarm, sees \u201csignificant inflows of capital\u201d into Ethereum once an ETF is approved.\n\n\u201cOnce you have allocated to Bitcoin, you also look to something else as part of portfolio diversification,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cNaturally, investors choose eth, as the next largest crypto asset.\u201d\n\nWhile inflows will probably pale in comparison to those for Bitcoin\u2019s ETF when it launched in January, \u201cit will still be enough to move the dial on its price action.\u201d\n\nKaiko\n\nOptions traders who have \u201ccrowded around\u201d bullish options are now looking at gains, said Adam McCarthy, an analyst at Kaiko.\n\nBut investors should be cautious, Kaiko said: \u201cHong Kong ETFs didn\u2019t see much demand and have had mixed days with several net outflow days already. No staking is a big factor too, and likely impacts demand further.\u201d\n\nHe suggested watching Grayscale\u2019s $9 billion ETHE product, \u201cif it suffers large outflows, that would be significant for prices.\u201d\n\nBernstein\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF will drive a 75% surge to $6,600, according to estimates made by Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, analysts at research firm Bernstein.\n\nThey noted that the SEC\u2019s approval of similar Bitcoin products in January spurred a 75% rally in the following weeks.\n\n\u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH,\u201d Chhugani and Sapra said in a report this week."

        "content": "As the overall crypto market begins to show signs of strength, Ethereum, the largest altcoin, sees an overnight increase in price. The bullish resurgence takes back the psychological $3,500 mark as the underlying demand increases in tandem with the improving sentiment surrounding the approval of the Ethereum ETF.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s bull run is further fueled by the market\u2019s recovery rally, which is being supported by Bitcoin\u2019s surge above $70,000. What\u2019s the deal, then? Will the price of Ethereum surpass $5,000?\n\nHere is an overview of Ethereum:\n\nETH Price Prediction For May 2024\n\nThe Ethereum price is $3,813.68, a change of 23.79% over the past 24 hours as of 8:20 p.m. The recent price action in Ethereum left the token\u2019s market capitalization at $453.80B. So far this year, Ethereum has a change of 66.09%. The recent price jump comes along with high volume as it has surged 335% in the last 24 hours.\n\nTechnical Analysis of Ethereum\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ether\u2019s current gains are part of a falling wedge breakout.\n\nA falling wedge forms when the price moves within a descending channel with two converging trendlines. Meanwhile, as a rule of technical analysis, the pattern resolves when the price breaks above its upper trendline and rises to its peak height.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis | Source: Tradingview\n\nToday, the price surged passed the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), as it moves toward $4000, expected as the initial target of the falling wedge breakout.\n\nEther open interest, funding rate rise sharply\n\nEther\u2019s price increase coincides with a sharp increase in its open interest (OI) and funding rates.\n\nOn May 21, Ether Futures OI increased by more than $3 billion, and jumped to $14.68 billion, while the funding rate reached a one-month high of 0.567% per week.\n\nA high OI typically indicates increased investor interest and confidence in the asset, implying that traders are preparing for possible price movements.\n\nMeanwhile, a high funding rate indicates that more traders are betting on Ether\u2019s price rising (long positions) than on it falling (short positions). This suggests that traders are bullish and willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions.\n\nCan Ethereum Reach $5,000?\n\nWhile the current market conditions favor Ethereum, reaching $5,000 depends on several factors, including:\n\nOverall market trends: Continued strength in the broader cryptocurrency market would benefit Ethereum.\n\nContinued strength in the broader cryptocurrency market would benefit Ethereum. Regulatory developments: Approval of an Ethereum ETF could trigger a significant price increase.\n\nApproval of an Ethereum ETF could trigger a significant price increase. Ethereum-specific developments: Progress on Ethereum\u2019s upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 could further boost investor confidence.\n\nOverall, the technical indicators and rising investor sentiment paint a bullish picture for Ethereum. However, external factors will ultimately determine whether the token can reach the $5,000 milestone."

However, if the financial regulator rejects applications for the ETFs, the market should expect an \u201cugly move back\u201d to $3,000, where ETH has multiple times demonstrated strong support at the $2,900 level.\n\n\u201cThis uncertainty has resulted in higher volatility, but the better trade might be spot-futures basis which is now yielding above 10% again.\u201d QCP Capital\n\nYou might also like: Bloomberg analyst: Ethereum ETF approval unlikely\n\nFollowing rumors of a potential approval, Ethereum\u2019s price surged nearly 20%, reaching $3,650 on Tuesday. QCP Capital previously cautioned that a \u201cresounding lack of interest\u201d in the market combined with the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could \u201ceasily\u201d boost ETH back to recent highs. The analysts cautioned that an unexpected approval might trigger a short squeeze, pushing ETH to new heights.\n\nHowever, the SEC may still have a card up its sleeve by introducing a nuanced distinction between Ethereum and staked Ethereum, classifying the latter as a security. According to Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, this strategy would align with the SEC\u2019s ongoing legal battles and investigations, allowing the commission to approve Ethereum ETFs while maintaining its established regulatory stance."

        "content": "In an extraordinary surge driven by speculation over potential spot Ethereum ETF approval, the value of the main altcoin skyrocketed on May 20, marking its largest single-day increase in market value to date. The cryptocurrency's price surged by over $590 in just 24 hours, pushing its market cap up by more than $70 billion and elevating its price to $3,660, a peak not seen since early April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThis meteoric rise has sent ripples through the crypto community. Notably, Billy Markus, co-creator of Dogecoin and known under the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto, remarked on the price surge, hinting at a long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum. Markus expressed a wish for ETH to reach $100,000, reflecting a broader sentiment of optimism among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nit\u2019s always weird when crypto is mooning because i know the rally will immediately end if i buy and go even more vertical if i sell Advertisement May 20, 2024\n\nMarkus's reflections also touched on the volatility and unpredictability of the crypto market. He noted the ironic timing of market movements, where personal buying or selling often coincides with immediate shifts in the opposite direction.\n\nDogecoin ETF next?\n\nThis epic price movement comes just days before an anticipated decision on the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Initially, top ETF experts estimated the chances of approval to be between 10-25%.\n\nHowever, recent market sentiment has surged, with current estimates placing the probability at 61%. This heightened expectation has fueled bullish predictions, with many market participants now eyeing $4,000 as the next significant target for Ethereum.\n\nThe potential approval of the Ethereum ETF has also sparked speculation about the future of other cryptocurrencies, with Dogecoin emerging as a candidate for similar investment products. As the primary meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin could see increased institutional interest if Ethereum's ETF gains approval, paving the way for broader acceptance and investment into the crypto market."

        "content": "A lot of excitement and speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts are predicting that if this approval happens, Ether could surge as high as $6,600.\n\nThe estimations come from analysts at the research firm, Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra. They pointed out that a 75% increase in value occurred in the weeks that followed the SEC\u2019s approval of comparable Bitcoin WTFs in January.\n\nEthereum surged past $6,600 on speculation of SEC approval for ETFs, with a 22% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s 4.5% rise. At the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price has dropped to $3,694. Its previous record was $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nIn research released on Tuesday, Chhugani and Sapra stated, \u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH.\u201d Two prominent Bloomberg Intelligence analysts created a stir on Monday when they increased the likelihood that an ETH ETF will be approved from 25% to 75%.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence, said they revised their forecast for the ETF in response to rumors that the SEC was talking to exchanges more frequently. As previous, analysts have expressed it appears that the US\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is at a standstill.\n\nPotential SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs could take two steps: first, the ETF would need to be approved in theory, but the products wouldn\u2019t actually be sold in the market until after that. Observers of the market have interpreted this distinction favorably.\n\nConfusion has spread throughout the market as a result of the uncertainties surrounding ETF clearance, especially on prediction sites like Polymarket where users have staked $8 million on the result. Existing bets may become more complex if a two-step approval process is implemented.\n\nDuring these changes, Bitcoin has increased by 4.5% and passed over $70,000 in the last day, while Ethereum has gained 22% to $3,790. With ramifications for other applicants as well, the market is eager to see the SEC\u2019s ruling on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal."

This development comes shortly after Cboe released amended 19b-4 forms.\n\nWhile the DTCC listing is a crucial step for the ETF, it does not guarantee the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval, which is still pending.\n\nVanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application will likely be the first to get a decision from the SEC. The SEC will decide whether to deny or approve the product.\n\nVan Eck filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in September 2023. Many other industry giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity also followed suit.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum-based funds was previously not promising as people involved in conversations with the SEC stated that there was an ongoing lack of engagement.\n\nHowever, things started to take a turn just a few days before the May 23 verdict. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate there is now a 75% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. They cite staking removal and political issues as the key drivers.\n\nStandard Chartered is also confident in the regulatory approval potential of the spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the bank is bullish on Ethereum\u2019s price, projecting that it is on track to hit $8,000 by year-end.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has shown impressive performance following positive developments in the Ethereum ETF. Ethereum surged 8% after Bloomberg analysts raised the odds and extended its rally, breaking through its $3,500 key level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up 31% in the last 7 days."

        "content": "As the price of ether increases, the cost of running a full solo staking node \u2014 with 32 ETH now worth $115,000 \u2014 moves further out of reach for all but the most hard core hobbyists.\n\nOne of the social goals that Oisin Kyne and Collin Myers, founders of Obol Network, care about most is enabling people that don\u2019t have that kind of capital to participate in Ethereum consensus.\n\nThe pair looks forward to the day when the number of entities and locations validating the network will rise tenfold from its current crop of single-digit thousands of operators.\n\nThat includes a fellow in a Kenyan village who, according to Kyne, participates in a distributed validator cluster via EtherFi, running his hardware off a Starlink and a generator.\n\n\u201cIt certainly feels good to have people that are staking \u2014 that have the technical ability and are really into it, but either weren\u2019t in early or don\u2019t have, you know, bags \u2014 that can actually decentralize Ethereum and quite happily do it from the middle of nowhere,\u201d Kyne told Blockworks.\n\nObol has spent the past few years proving out the technology to decentralize projects like Lido, its launch partner, and to enable more solo stakers as well as new paradigms like squad staking.\n\n\u201cWe worked with [Lido] to integrate the technology into their stack, and now we\u2019re progressively opening the code base, decentralizing the community, and in the future plan to incentivize the community and bring everyone together around this contribution based mindset,\u201d Myers told Blockworks.\n\nAs a first step, Obol has announced the \u201c1% For Decentralisation\u201d funding model for the DVT middleware provider.\n\nUnder the plan, Obol\u2019s distributed validator (DV) clusters will contribute 1% of their staking rewards \u201ctoward projects that add value and impact at the Ethereum consensus layer, including technology partners, researchers, community educators, node operators, and more,\u201d according to a blog post published Tuesday.\n\nThe initiative piggybacks off the EasyRetroPGF \u2014 or Retroactive Public Goods Funding \u2014 system pioneered by GitCoin.\n\nWhereas public good funding from the Optimism Foundation focuses on the execution layer and user adoption, \u201cthere needs to be a more concerted focus around the validator, infrastructure area, the consensus integrity, that whole side of the network,\u201d the Obol founders say.\n\nMiddleware provides an interface between Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer and software further up the modular stack.\n\n\u201cThe creation of middleware enables add-on use cases to your existing experience,\u201d Myers explained. \u201cWithout middleware, it\u2019s just a boring old validator \u2014 you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nMEV Boost is one example in wide use alongside Obol today, that enables the little guy to earn similar staking yields as large professional operators. And soon validators will be able to participate in EigenLayer Actively Validated Services (AVS) or similar offerings on top.\n\n\u201cAll of this is an extension of the validator as a world-class citizen of Web3,\u201d Myers said.\n\nEthereum is sometimes criticized for the complexity of its design, or for tolerating centralizing influences in certain areas, such as block building and the scaling of the execution layer.\n\nBut Myers feels those attacks are misplaced.\n\n\u201cFrom where I sit, two years ago we went from bad rent extraction, client centralization, a completely monolithic software stack, and now we\u2019ve moved to modular, a bit more decentralized, open source, multiple options, lots of funding, good debate \u2014 and for me that\u2019s progress,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile there is some movement in the direction of ossifying the base consensus layer, he pushes back against the notion that the roadmap is decreasing innovation at layer one. Rather, \u201cthey are just enabling it to exist elsewhere through decentralization\u2026and DVT is a living example of that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cstage\u201d framework used by L2beat is a useful gauge of decentralization progress, and Osin agreed with Vitalik\u2019s commitment to push \u201clayer-2s\u201d as such to reach the Stage 1 level by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting social showing, of people being like, \u2018no, we\u2019re not going to tolerate a sidechain masquerading as an L2, unless you can permissionlessly exit back to L1,\u201d Osin said.\n\nLido is backing the new Obol funding approach, with contributor Will Shannon, calling it \u201ca fantastic approach to strengthening the resilience and decentralization of the Ethereum protocol.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Standard Chartered reaffirmed its projection that Ethereum (ETH) will reach $8,000 by the end of the year, following heightened anticipation of ETF approvals.\n\nStanChart\u2019s head of crypto research, Geoffrey Kendrick, said in a note shared with CryptoSlate that recent developments reflect heightened investor optimism and increased market activity.\n\nKendrick\u2019s statement comes after Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchanus significantly increased the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETFs being approved this week.\n\nBalchanus raised the odds from 25% to 75%, citing changes in the Biden administration\u2019s stance on the approvals. Polymarket similarly revised the approval odds to over 60% from 10%.\n\nThe announcement has had a ripple effect across the crypto market, influencing both trading platforms and asset prices.\n\nKendrick also highlighted that the net asset value (NAV) discount on the ETH Grayscale Trust (ETHE) narrowed significantly over the past day, jumping from -25% to -12% \u2014 signaling increasing optimism in the market.\n\nEthereum prices have responded robustly, climbing 18% to $3,700. This rise has positively impacted the broader crypto market, with several digital assets experiencing similar uptrends. The focus now shifts to the US SEC, which is expected to make a decision on the spot ETH applications by Thursday.\n\nBalchanus recalled the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs on Jan. 10, which came shortly after a report from the hacked SEC Twitter account the previous day. Market participants are watching closely for a similar timing pattern in the ETH ETF decision.\n\nIn a March research note, Kendrick projected that the approval of ETH ETFs could lead to inflows ranging between $15 billion and $45 billion within the first year. He maintains this forecast, emphasizing the potentially greater impact of ETH ETF flows compared to BTC ETFs.\n\nHe argued that the relative lack of alternatives for ETH positions pre-ETFs and the perception of Ethereum as the \u2018big tech\u2019 of digital assets will drive significant investor interest.\n\nKendrick has set ambitious price targets for Ethereum, forecasting it to reach $8,000 by the end of 2024 and $14,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nHe also noted the positive implications for Bitcoin, expecting a fresh all-time high for BTC by the weekend, surpassing the previous peak of $73,798 set on March 14. He reiterated his year-end price targets of $150,000 for 2024 and $200,000 for 2025 for Bitcoin.\n\nThe impending decision on ETH ETFs could further legitimize the crypto sector, potentially driving significant capital inflows and boosting market confidence. Investors and market watchers await Thursday\u2019s decision, which could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader digital asset market.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds will get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, Standard Chartered believes\u2014and the prices of both ETH and Bitcoin (BTC) will rocket upwards as a result.\n\nThe British multinational bank\u2019s digital assets researcher Geoff Kendrick wrote Tuesday that if the SEC approves ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Thursday, as expected, the price of the asset could rocket\u2014and hit $8,000 by the end of the year.\n\nETH is currently trading at $3,770, according to CoinGecko, having shot up 22% in 24 hours after rumors swirled yesterday that a spot Ethereum ETF could hit the U.S. market sooner rather than later.\n\nBut the price of ETH isn\u2019t the only thing that could benefit: Kendrick added that Bitcoin could face big upwards pressure, too. \u201cThe ETH news, if correct, comes at an opportune moment for BTC,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAn ETH ETF approval will further legitimize the sector and therefore be BTC-positive as well,\u201d he continued, adding that he \u201cwould expect a fresh all-time high in BTC by the weekend.\u201d\n\nBTC\u2019s price now stands at $70,314 per coin. It touched an all-time high of $73,737 in March, but had remained well below the $70,000 mark for much of the last month.\n\nEthereum is the network behind the second biggest digital asset, ETH. Many prominent asset managers have filed paperwork with the SEC to release a spot ETH ETF in the United States.\n\nSuch a fund would give everyday investors the ability to buy shares that trade on a stock exchange and track the price of ETH via brokerage accounts. VanEck, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton are among the firms hoping to gain approval.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC reluctantly said yes to 11 BTC ETFs in January, and they've since received record inflows\u2014pushing the price of BTC up as a result.\n\nBut the regulator has been quiet on the process of approving the ETH ETFs, leading industry analysts in recent weeks to expect a delay on the process. That changed Monday, when analysts from Bloomberg said that they now expect imminent approval\u2014a statement now echoed by Standard Chartered.\n\nStandard Chartered predicted in April that BTC would hit $150,000 per coin this year, and that ETH could hit $8,000 this year and then $14,000 per coin by the end of 2025.\n\nThe bank reiterated that claim in today\u2019s report.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart confirms the amendments.\n\nShare this article\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart shared on X that the movement to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US \u201cis happening.\u201d According to Seyffart, at least five of the potential Ethereum ETF issuers have submitted their Amended 19b-4s in a 25-minute timespan.\n\nUPDATE: It's happening. We have at least 5 of the potential #Ethereum ETF issuers that have submitted their Amended 19b-4's in the last ~25 min.\n\nFidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE. pic.twitter.com/pHGt8iRWi8 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 21, 2024\n\n\u201cFidelity, VanEck, Invesco/Galaxy, Ark/21Shares, & Franklin all submitted via CBOE,\u201d he added. The 19b-4 Form is one of the mandatory documents that need to be filed before the SEC can approve an ETF.\n\nHowever, even with the spot Ethereum ETFs approved in the US, Seyffart highlights that this doesn\u2019t mean an immediate launch. Notably, it can take up to months after the approval of Ethereum ETFs before they can be officially traded.\n\n\u201cBut these filings prove that all of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate. Need to actually see SEC approval orders on all the 19b-4s AND THEN we need to see S-1 approvals. Could be weeks or more before ETFs launch,\u201d added the Bloomberg analyst in another post.\n\nMost likely a political decision\n\nCommenting on a The Block article about the motivations behind the sudden pivot to a spot Ethereum ETF approval, Seyffart agreed with undisclosed sources that stated this is \u201ca completely unprecedented situation, which means it\u2019s entirely political,\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019re not even internally coordinated yet, which is why this is most likely a political decision.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas already suggested this in a Monday X post, saying that rumors around the SEC shift in stance pointed to \u201cpolitical issues.\u201d\n\nSeyffart concludes his series of posts on X by admitting that he was wrong about a spot Ethereum ETF approval not happening this week, but so was the entire market.\n\nNotably, as reported by Crypto Briefing, not even notorious fund managers were expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US this week. Katherine Dowling, general counsel for ETF applicant Bitwise, said that \u201cmost people are universally expecting a disapproval order.\u201d VanEck CEO Jan van Eck also predicted a likely denial during a CNBC interview."

        "content": "Investors are abuzz with excitement as Ethereum, experiencing a 17% surge within 24 hours, reaches $3,645, igniting a frenzy in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe asset leads in liquidations, totaling $114.47 million, with $29.98 million in Longs and a significant $84.50 million in Shorts. This dramatic rise highlights Ethereum\u2019s volatility and market dominance.\n\nImage Source: Coinglass (Liquidation Map)\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum (ETH) surged to an intraday peak of $3,691 per coin, driven by swirling rumors on social media and forums about the potential SEC approval of several spot ETH ETFs. According to various reports, sources revealed that exchanges were allegedly instructed by the SEC to expedite their 19b-4 filings.\n\nBloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart significantly raised their approval predictions from 25% to 75%, adding to the market excitement. As a result, ETH saw a substantial increase, rising from $3,140 at 3 p.m. Eastern Time (EDT) on May 20 to a high of $3,691 per coin by 6:30 p.m. EDT.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen a significant increase, rising 17.96% against the U.S. dollar and adding $551 to its value in just a few hours. This surge has pushed Ether\u2019s dominance in the cryptocurrency market to 17%, giving it a total market valuation of $438 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume surged a staggering 254%, valued at $37 Billion.\n\nThe total crypto market liquidations reached $340.35 million, with $77.26 million Longs liquidated and $263.34 million in Short. Over the last day, 78,944 traders faced liquidation, totaling $340.61 million. The largest individual liquidation occurred on Huobi, with an ETH-USDT value of $3.11 million.\n\nThe upcoming decision on the Ethereum ETF has stirred up a lot of interest in the weekly and monthly ETH options expiries. On Deribit, the top derivatives exchange, the open interest for Ether options is substantial: $867 million on May 24 and an impressive $3.22 billion on May 31.\n\nThe call-to-put ratio on Deribit heavily favors call options, suggesting that traders are more inclined towards buying options than selling them."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF approval possible tomorrow keeping BlackRock 10 year approval streak alive - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The SEC could approve a spot Ethereum ETF as early as this week, marking a significant shift in regulatory stance. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased their odds of approval to 75%, up from 25%, citing recent chatter and the SEC\u2019s request for revised 19b-4 filings by 10 am Tuesday. This rapid development has led to a scramble among applicants, including major players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, has a strong track record with the SEC, having only one ETF application denied in 2014. That ETF, the BlackRock Total Return ETF, was initially rejected due to concerns over transparency and alignment with its net asset value (NAV). However, an updated version of this ETF, addressing the SEC\u2019s concerns, went live in December 2023, just a month before the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. This history emphasizes BlackRock\u2019s ability to navigate regulatory challenges successfully.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on Ethereum ETFs has been eagerly anticipated, with deadlines for various applications approaching. Data from Bloomberg Terminal shared by James Seyffart lists the ETFs awaiting approval, including those from VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Grayscale, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity, Franklin, and Bitwise. These applications have faced multiple delays, but the recent push for revised filings suggests a potential breakthrough.\n\nGrayscale and BlackRock have been proactive in updating their applications. Grayscale filed an S-3 registration statement to convert its existing Ethereum Trust to a spot ETF and an S-1 for a mini Ethereum ETF. BlackRock\u2019s Nasdaq amendment to its 19b-4 filing proposes cash-based creation and redemptions, aligning with other Ethereum ETF applications and previously approved Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s cautious approach has been influenced by concerns over market manipulation and the need for comprehensive market data on Ethereum. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, following a court victory by Grayscale, and the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, has raised hopes for similar products for Ethereum. The SEC\u2019s recent interactions with ETF issuers have been described as one-sided, with agency staff withholding substantive comments, leading to speculation about potential rejections.\n\nDespite these challenges, the crypto community remains optimistic, with Ethereum rising 17% in the past 24 hours. The approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum, potentially increasing market liquidity and stability. The involvement of prominent asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity adds credibility to these products, which could attract institutional investors and drive further adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile not guaranteed, BlackRock\u2019s storied history of overcoming regulatory hurdles and having products approved suggests the odds are in their favor this week. An Ethereum ETF greenlight would mark a new era for crypto\u2019s mainstream integration.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Standard Chartered Bank has expressed high confidence in Ethereum ETF approval this week. Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, stated that he is \u201c80% to 90%\u201d sure that Ethereum ETFs will receive the green light from the regulatory body.\n\nThe first round of spot ETH ETF deadlines is rapidly approaching, with VanEck\u2019s application set for May 23 and Ark Invest/21Shares\u2019 following on May 24.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: Top 3 Meme Coins That Can Double Your Investment In 2024\n\nPotential Inflows and Ethereum Price Targets\n\nAccording to Kendrick, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs could drive substantial inflows into the cryptocurrency. Standard Chartered estimates that these ETFs could attract between 2.39 million and 9.15 million ETH in the first 12 months following approval. This equates to roughly $15 billion to $45 billion in U.S. dollar terms.\n\nKendrick also noted that these projected inflows are similar to Standard Chartered\u2019s estimates for Bitcoin ETFs, which have proven to be accurate thus far.\n\nIn an analysis note sent to The Block on Tuesday, Kendrick further elaborated on Standard Chartered\u2019s price targets for ETH. If spot Ethereum ETFs receive approval this week, the bank expects ether to keep pace with Bitcoin, maintaining the current 5.4% price ratio for the remainder of 2024. Given Standard Chartered\u2019s projection of bitcoin reaching $150,000 by the end of 2024, this would imply an ETH price of $8,000.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum (ETH) Forecasted To Hit $10,000: Here\u2019s When\n\nLooking further ahead, Standard Chartered has reiterated its ETH price target of $14,000 by the end of 2025, based on the bank\u2019s estimated BTC price level of $200,000 by that time.\n\nThe prospect of ETH ETF approval has already had a notable impact on the market, with ETH\u2019s price surging by over 22% in the past 24 hours. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,767."

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) discount has shrunk to under 10%, its lowest level since 2021, amid growing expectations for approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAs of May 21, market data from YCharts shows the ETHE discount rate has narrowed to 6.66%. The \u201cdiscount\u201d indicates when ETHE shares trade below their net asset value (NAV).\n\nETHE began trading at a discount in early 2021 after Grayscale halted redemptions, reaching nearly 60% in late 2022.\n\nHowever, it started to narrow in 2023 as Grayscale secured significant legal victories against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. Since then, the discount has hovered between 10% and 20% before sharply dipping to 6% following recent developments around the Ethereum ETF.\n\nWhat is driving the discount?\n\nThis week, reports emerged that the US SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs, a significant shift from previous expectations.\n\nSeveral ETF applicants swiftly amended their filings with the financial regulator in response. On May 21, Grayscale and other issuers like Fidelity withdrew the staking proposal from their spot Ethereum ETF plans.\n\nAs a result, market analysts have suggested that the narrowing discount in ETHE was a sign that traders were piling into the product to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities the discount presented and sell spot if ETHE converts to an ETF.\n\nConsequently, experts have cautioned that a Grayscale Ethereum ETF could experience substantial outflows at launch, mirroring the GBTC\u2019s situation. Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, wrote:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget what happened with GBTC post BTC ETF approval. Grayscale\u2019s ETH product holds 2.9m ETH (c. $10bn). This represents about 76% of the total float of ETH investment products globally. This was more than GBTC held prior to BTC ETF approval.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "How Ethereum Danksharding Will Impact Decentralized Finance - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has encountered significant challenges regarding scalability. The current mainnet can only handle 20 to 30 transactions per second (TPS), significantly lower than traditional payment systems. The high transaction fees on Ethereum have deterred users and restricted network accessibility. Initially, during the early stages of Ethereum 2.0, the leading scaling solution proposed was sharding, splitting the Ethereum network into \u201cshards\" for parallel transaction processing.\n\nHowever, due to concerns about complexity and security risks related to cross-shard communication, sharding became less favored over time. Before danksharding, other solutions, such as sharding and layer-2 scaling methods, such as rollups, were suggested to address Ethereum's scalability problems. These alternatives also had limitations in scalability and complexity, leading to the development of danksharding as a solution for scaling the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is Danksharding?\n\nDanksharding is a highly technical solution that works with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions, such as roll-ups, to improve scalability and efficiency on the Ethereum network. Ethereum\u2019s danksharding solutions aim to improve the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain by handling more transactions. This approach, part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, is crafted to outperform traditional sharding methods. In essence, danksharding segments the blockchain into fragments known as shards to process transactions and data simultaneously, enabling improved data processing without causing network congestion or increased fees.\n\nUsing larger data segments, danksharding boosts transaction capacity, enhancing the blockchain's performance. Danksharding aims to reduce transaction expenses and improve throughput by expanding block space and refining data availability. The Dencun upgrade was officially rolled out on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024. Expert analysts believe that the Dencun upgrade, which includes proto-danksharding, could be a \u201cbullish catalyst\u201d for the Ethereum price prediction in the second half of 2024, with Bed Baddow projecting the highest value the coin could reach by the end of the year is over $6400. This upgrade will impact Ethereum's price, potentially positively driving prices upwards towards this value.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Danksharding and Traditional Sharding Methods?\n\nThe main difference between danksharding and traditional sharding methods for Ethereum is the approach to scaling. Traditional sharding aimed to increase Ethereum's transaction processing capacity by dividing the network into multiple \u201cshard chains.\u201d This created a security issue for Ethereum since the multiple shards would share security at a consensus level. For instance, if the network was divided into ten shards, each shard became vulnerable to malicious attacks due to validators being spread out.\n\nTo address the security concerns with traditional sharding and the shift in Ethereum's scaling roadmap towards lay-2 solutions, danksharding was developed as a more secure and efficient scaling solution. This streamlined process is designed to simplify transactions within the network\u2019s shards, providing a more efficient path for Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nHow Will Danksharding Impact the Decentralization of Ethereum?\n\nThe impact of danksharding on the decentralization of Ethereum is a mixed bag, with potential benefits and drawbacks:\n\nPotential Benefits of Decentralization\n\n\u25cf Reduced hardware requirements for nodes: Ethereum nodes will only need to store and process data for their assigned shard rather than the entire blockchain history. This reduction in hardware and storage requirements could make it much easier for more nodes to participate in the network, potentially increasing decentralization.\n\n\u25cf Improved scalability and efficiency: Dankshanding is expected to improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction processing efficiency significantly. This could potentially make the network more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users and developers, which could expand decentralization.\n\nPotential Drawbacks\n\n\u25cf Vulnerability of smaller rollups: Unlike traditional sharding, danksharding moves the validation of transactions off-chain, with the Ethereum mainnet acting as a data availability layer. However, this shift away from on-chain validation has raised concerns about the network\u2019s overall decentralization, mainly because the validation has become more centralized.\n\n\u25cf Shift from on-chain to off-chain validation: Danksharding\u2019s reliance on rollups might expose less popular rollups to security risks due to their limited number of validators. This could consolidate power and influence within well-established rollups, ultimately threatening decentralization.\n\n\u25cf Increased validator concentration: Danksharding could lead to block builders and an increase in validators receiving a larger share of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) profits. This concentration of power among smaller groups of validators can affect the overall decentralization of the network.\n\nIncreased Transaction Processing Capacity\n\nDanksharding is designed to allow Ethereum to process transactions much faster than it currently does. Ethereum transactions using danksharding have the potential to process over 100,000 TPS. This will dramatically improve Ethereum\u2019s scalability, making it more compatible with traditional payment systems.\n\nAdditionally, this allows DeFi applications to handle a much larger volume of transactions, potentially reducing congestion and delays. The increased transaction processing capacity could help reinforce Ethereum\u2019s competitiveness and decentralization in the future.\n\nCompatibility with Layer-2 Solutions\n\nDanksharding is specifically designed to work with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 scaling solutions. This integration is expected to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of layer-2 networks, making them more competitive with alternative layer-1 blockchains. One of the biggest benefits of danksharding is its ability to reduce transaction fees up to ten times for layer-2 solutions.\n\nChallenges of Danksharding\n\nFull danksharding will take years to implement. The transition from the initial sharding proposal to the danksharding approach required a massive shift in Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap, adding to the complexity of implementation.\n\nThe biggest concern and challenge of danksharding is that it compromises Ethereum\u2019s security in the long run. Many see the shift from on-chain validation as a security risk, making the network vulnerable to potential attacks. Ethereum\u2019s use of smaller rollups that handle blob-carrying transactions is seen as vulnerable due to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet\u2019s weaker protection mechanism. Ensuring the security and integrity of the network as it scales will be critical, and Ethereum would need to address this.\n\nFurthermore, the decentralization risks associated with danksharding are from its reliance on layer-2 rollup solutions, which may result in larger and more established rollup providers gaining more influence and power. Maintaining the overall decentralization of the Ethereum network is a vital consideration as the network scales and evolves.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDanksharding is a positive step in the right direction for decentralized finance on the Ethereum network. It can significantly improve scalability, efficiency, and user experience on DeFi applications. This could lead to increased adoption and growth of DeFi platforms, as the reduced costs and increased efficiency make them more attractive to institutions like crypto exchanges, wallets, blockchain gambling and gaming, and metaverse platforms."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mulls applications for spot Ethereum ETFs\u2014with analysts expecting approval as soon as this week\u2014amended filings from several asset managers have dropped their language around staking.\n\nStaking refers to the process through which users delegate Ethereum tokens to the network in exchange for rewards. It became a core component of Ethereum\u2019s security model with the network\u2019s long-planned shift to a proof-of-stake consensus model in 2022.\n\nFidelity dropped language regarding the staking of customer funds in its proposed ETF, submitting an amended filing on Tuesday. The measure mirrored a similar move made by Ark Invest/21 Shares, which erased staking mentions earlier this month from its application, which the SEC is due to decide on this week.\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETF filers bent the knee by removing staking language to appease a recently humbled SEC,\u201d 3iQ Head Of Research Mark Connors told Decrypt. \u201cWe see the removal of staking language as a temporary concession.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf spot Ethereum ETFs get a regulatory green light, then that could mean a significant portion of Ethereum\u2019s supply rests idled in any approved funds. As of this writing, about 27% of Ethereum\u2019s supply\u2014or 32 million ETH\u2014is staked, according to a Dune dashboard.\n\nThough the SEC appears open to approving spot Ethereum ETFs, as the regulator engages meaningfully with asset managers, staking has emerged as a contentious aspect of Ethereum over the past two years. In lawsuits, the regulator has alleged that Ethereum staking services constitute securities offerings on behalf of several firms.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler spoke specifically about staking services in an agency video a year ago, arguing that investors deserve certain disclosures on how crypto is handled by companies when staked, such as if funds are commingled.\n\nIn other regions, such as Canada, funds that hold staked Ethereum have shown that it can be done. Two of 3iQ\u2019s exchange-traded products, for example, began offering customers the benefits of Ethereum staking in 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConnors said the change in the SEC\u2019s posture must be due to political pressure the agency faces over SAB 121, a crypto-custody rule that lawmakers voted last week to erase.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s regulation by enforcement method is clearly under assault,\u201d he said.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Stablecoin issuer Tether minted $1 billion USDT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, capitalizing on a market upswing driven by hopes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve a spot ETH ETF for trading this week.\n\nWhale Alert first reported the minting, which was later confirmed by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, who wrote:\n\n\u201cPSA: 1B USDt inventory replenish on Ethereum Network. Note this is an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps.\u201d\n\nInventory replenish\n\nMarket analysts suggested that Tether\u2019s new minting is a strategic move ahead of a potential market rally triggered by an ETH ETF approval. Ivan Sherbakov, CEO of Cryptorobotics, said this minting \u201cwill be used as liquidity to pump the market ahead of ETF news.\u201d\n\nThis analysis aligns with data showing a correlation between the increasing supply of USDT and a broader upward movement in the crypto market, leading to higher volumes and a more dynamic environment for digital assets.\n\nUsually, Tether\u2019s inventory replenishment involves creating new USDT tokens in anticipation of heightened customer demand. These tokens, held in Tether\u2019s treasury, are classified as \u201cauthorized but not issued,\u201d meaning they are not yet in circulation or included in USDT\u2019s current total market cap.\n\nAccording to Tether\u2019s Transparency page, there were $87.8 million worth of such USDT on Ethereum as of May 21. Over the past year, Tether\u2019s market cap has grown significantly, surpassing $110 billion and controlling around 70% of the market, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nThis growth can be attributed to several factors, including the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Moreover, Tether has seen varying degrees of success in its other endeavors, which include diversifying its operations beyond its flagship USDT stablecoin product into other sectors like Bitcoin mining.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies surged higher on Tuesday amid growing optimism about the SEC's upcoming decisions on spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, with the first decision expected this week. In the wake of the reports, analysts are voicing their expectations on how a potential approval would affect Ethereum prices.\n\nEthereum ETF saga sees new developments\n\nThe crypto rally on Tuesday was chiefly led by Ether, with the world\u2019s second-largest crypto asset surging more than 22% to $3,781.\n\nAdding to the speculation was a report by CoinDesk, which, citing sources familiar with the matter, said that the SEC had asked exchanges to update their 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis, signaling potential approval of these applications ahead of a key deadline on Thursday.\n\nHowever, this does not guarantee the authorization of Ethereum ETFs, the report added.\n\nIssuers must also have their S-1 applications approved before the products can start trading. The SEC can take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, as it is not bound by a deadline, per the report.\n\nOne company in discussions with the SEC reportedly suggested it might be on the right track for approval, a notable shift from weeks earlier when it felt the SEC was delaying.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts hiked the odds of spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% from 25% after hearing that the SEC might be adopting a more favorable stance toward the applications.\n\nThe broader crypto market tracked Ethereum price gains. climbed 6% on the day, while , ADA, and DOGE jumped 5.8%, 6.9%, and 10.3%, respectively.\n\n\u201cThis sudden flip in expectations is an unexpected boon for investors who have been crying out for a driver after the [Bitcoin] halving passed and bitcoin ETFs were launched in the U.S. and Hong Kong,\u201d said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo.\n\n\u201cIf the spot ETH ETFs are approved, altcoins should take off as ether is often a leading indicator for the rest of the crypto market.\u201d\n\nIf the reports are true, it marks significant progress from previous expectations as many expected the SEC to deny Ethereum ETF applications this week due to concerns over the complexity and regulatory challenges associated with Ether compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe lack of a legal precedent similar to Bitcoin's ETF approval further complicates the issue, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently stressing the need for investor protection and compliance with securities laws.\n\nEthereum price forecast\n\nIn their comments on the aforementioned developments, Bernstein analysts said Tuesday that given Bitcoin's 75% rally since the ETF approval, they would expect a similar surge in Ethereum prices. Moreover, they note that ETH's free float and supply appear even more attractive than Bitcoin's.\n\n\u201cETH since its transition to proof of stake, has been deflationary. Further, 38% of ETH is locked in staking, financial smart contracts and layer 2 chains - feature unique to programmable ETH and not seen with Bitcoin,\u201d Bernstein analysts said.\n\n\u201c66% of ETH supply has not moved in last 1 year (similar holding behavior as Bitcoin) and supply on exchanges is at all-time-low. Thus, ETH supply remains constrained by sticky investors and utility locking supply in financial smart contracts,\u201d they added.\n\nEarlier this year, Standard Chartered (OTC: ) analysts said they expect the SEC to approve Ethereum ETFs on May 23, aligning with the timeline for Bitcoin ETFs approved in January 2024.\n\nThe bank predicted significant inflows for the crypto asset, estimating 2.39-9.15 million ETH, which amounts to between $15 and $45 billion, in the first year post-approval.\n\nIf approved, Standard Chartered anticipated that Ethereum prices would keep pace with BTC, maintaining the current 5.4% price ratio through 2024. Given their projection of BTC reaching $150,000 by the end of 2024, this implies an Ethereum price of around $8,000."

That\u2019s because a crucial deadline for VanEck\u2019s 19b-4 filing is coming up: If the SEC doesn\u2019t approve that filing by then, it will be as if the agency rejected the application.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just VanEck\u2019s problem. Just like with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC likely wants to approve all potential Ethereum ETFs at the same time to avoid giving an advantage to any one specific product. So every issuer needs to rush to get that document ready by VanEck\u2019s deadline.\n\nHowever, once the 19b-4s are approved, the SEC and prospective issuers have a lot more time to finalise S-1 filings.\n\n\u201cThe SEC spent nearly four months reviewing and iterating Bitcoin spot S-1s and five months reviewing Bitcoin futures S-1s,\u201d Scott Johnsson, an associate at international law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, wrote.\n\n\u201cIf the division of Corporation Finance indeed was told about this potential approval yesterday, then they\u2019re likely just getting started,\u201d he added.\n\nIn other words, the SEC will likely signal on Thursday that it will be approving the Ethereum ETFs by finalising the 19b-4 filings \u2014 but it will only officially greenlight them later on, possibly this summer, once the S-1 filings are dealt with as well.\n\n\u201cA month would be a pretty quick turnaround,\u201d Johnsson said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically a single turn of SEC comments.\u201d\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

Potential Price Impact: Analysts at Standard Chartered predict a surge in ether prices to $8,000 by the end of 2024 if an ETF is approved. The influx of new capital, combined with the increased legitimacy, could fuel a significant price rally.\n\nJohn Patrick Mullin, Founder and CEO of MANTRA, emphasized the relevance of ETH ETFs, noting that they represent a substantial opportunity for institutional investment.\n\n\u201cGiven the innovative nature of Ethereum\u2019s tech, including smart contracts and a wide range of dApps, ETH ETFs might attract significant interest from investors who are keen on more diverse crypto exposures,\u201d Mullin stated.\n\nThe approval of ETH ETFs could potentially lead to massive inflows of capital.\n\nMullin believes that ETH ETFs could see similar or even greater inflows compared to Bitcoin ETFs due to Ethereum\u2019s versatile technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Andrey Stoychev, Head of Prime Brokerage at Nexo, estimated that Ether-based ETFs might see volumes roughly 30% lower than spot Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting Bitcoin\u2019s pioneering status.\n\nCould It Lead To Other Altcoin ETFs?\n\nApproved ETH ETFs could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs. Cryptocurrency traders have even suggested a Dogecoin DOGE/USD ETF is not out of the question.\n\nMullin suggests that once regulatory bodies are comfortable with Ethereum, it could lead to broader acceptance and recognition of other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThis could diversify the market further and provide more investment opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nStoychev echoed this sentiment, stating that the success of an ETH ETF could streamline the approval process for future altcoin ETFs, provided they meet the SEC\u2019s requirements.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For The Price Of Ethereum?\n\nThe approval of ETH ETFs is expected to have a significant impact on Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nMullin believes that approval would initiate a virtuous cycle of stable liquidity and trust-building, potentially leading to more ETFs and increased adoption.\n\n\u201cMass Adoption. It's happening due to ETF approvals,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nIn contrast, a denial could lead to a temporary drop in ETH\u2019s price due to negative sentiment, although the long-term impact might be less severe if the broader crypto market remains positive.\n\nStoychev noted that if approved, ETH could experience a price increase similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 50% rise post-ETF approval.\n\n\u201cETH could potentially rise to above $4,000,\u201d he suggested, while also warning of a temporary lull and a potential drop back to $3,000 if the ETF is not approved.\n\nAlso Read: Top House Democrats Will Not Rally Party Against Crypto Bill Despite Opposition\n\nWhat Do Experts Think About Ethereum ETFs?\n\nRoy Hui, Co-Founder and CEO of LightLink, highlighted Ethereum\u2019s expansive ecosystem and its role as a pivotal infrastructure for the global digital landscape.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETF stands out amid other crypto ETFs due to Ethereum\u2019s expansive ecosystem, robust economy and leading market capitalization,\u201d Hui said.\n\nAlvin Kan, COO of Bitget Wallet, pointed out that the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs could lead to increased investment, funds, and liquidity from the U.S. stock market, supporting ETH\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cThis may mimic the impact of Bitcoin, where external liquidity significantly increases its price, leading to a new historical high in a relatively short period of time,\u201d Kan explained.\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nThe approval process for Ethereum ETFs faces several challenges, especially from the SEC.\n\nUnder Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has shown a preference for cryptocurrencies that adhere to Bitcoin BTC/USD like standards, posing special challenges for Ethereum due to its security and securitization risks.\n\nKan also noted that the approval of an Ethereum ETF could set new standards for other cryptocurrencies and provide them with examples of applying for their own ETFs.\n\nConversely, a rejection could imply that only cryptocurrencies following Bitcoin-like standards would be considered for ETFs, excluding those based on proof of stake (PoS).\n\nThe potential approval of ETH ETFs represents a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency market, with significant implications for Ethereum and other digital assets.\n\nAs the industry waits with bated breath, the decision could either propel Ethereum into a new era of institutional adoption or prompt a temporary market correction.\n\nThe future of digital assets and regulatory trends will be further explored at Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nIndustry leaders, investors, and policymakers will gather to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape, offering valuable insights into the impact of regulatory decisions like the potential approval of Fidelity\u2019s spot Ether ETF.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Turns Bullish: 10x Research Highlights Key Trade Strategy\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "title": "SEC signals possible approval of anticipated Ethereum spot ETFs - Fox Business",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is moving closer to approving a highly anticipated 'spot' Ethereum exchange-traded fund as soon as this week, FOX Business has learned.\n\nAccording to sources close to the Commission, the SEC and its Chairman Gary Gensler are taking cues from recent court rulings and prior guidance on Ethereum futures ETFs to grant nine issuers permission to offer products that track the daily price of the world's second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nSEC CHAIRMAN GENSLER'S STATEMENT ON SPOT BITCOIN ETFS\n\nWhile approval isn't certain, SEC staff have been signaling they're warming up to the idea of at least partially green lighting these products as soon as Thursday, which is the deadline for the agency to decide whether to approve so-called 19b-4 applications filed by the CBOE exchange, requesting to list Ethereum spot ETFs from VanEck and Ark Investments in partnership with 21 Shares.\n\nApproving the 19b-4 applications is the first in a two-part process where the SEC would also have to approve issuers' registration statements, known as S-1s - a process that could take several weeks - meaning the ETFs may not officially launch until later this year.\n\nCONSUMER ETFS SHOWING THE REAL INFLATION PICTURE\n\nBut an SEC blessing would be yet another significant development in the maturation of the $2 trillion crypto industry.\n\nMany had given up hope the SEC would smile on an Ethereum spot ETF, given the lack of engagement on applications and the uncertainty surrounding the Commission's thinking about Ethereum's status as a possible security.\n\nBut on Monday the SEC began actively engaging with issuers and national exchanges ahead of Thursday's deadline, which is what it did before approving eleven ETFs that tracked the daily price of Bitcoin in January.\n\nLIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE\n\nThe SEC, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nPotential ETF issuers who spoke on the condition of anonymity tell FOX Business they were surprised by what appeared to be a sudden change of heart by the agency.\n\nMany industry participants have attributed the abrupt SEC engagement to the increasing bipartisan support for the digital assets industry from Congress and former President Trump, who has said he would embrace the use of crypto and end the Biden Administration's regulatory \"hostility\" towards the industry if elected.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign updated its website to accept donations in cryptocurrency.\n\nStill, sources familiar with Gensler's thinking say he has been looking at other factors such as the court ruling involving crypto asset manager Grayscale and the Commission's prior green lighting of Ethereum futures ETFs, which came to market in October.\n\nBITCOIN'S BOUNCE IN EARLY INNINGS\n\nLast summer, a federal appeals court rejected the SEC's decision to deny Grayscale's petition to convert its GBTC Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF, saying the agency failed to make convincing arguments the bitcoin spot ETF was materially different to the futures ETF which had been trading since 2021. The Grayscale ruling laid the groundwork for the rollout of the bitcoin spot ETFs, and now, possibly the Ethereum spot ETFs as well.\n\nAccording to paperwork filed today by issuers, it appears the SEC's main sticking point for approving an Ethereum spot ETF is the so-called \"staking,\" which allows investors to earn passive income by staking their Ethereum as collateral and earning a return. In an ETF format, it may allow for investors to receive greater returns as opposed to the ones they may receive with an ETF that solely tracks the daily price of Ethereum.\n\nIt's staking by which the SEC believes it may have a case that \"Ethereum 2.0\", or Ethereum issued since the blockchain's merge to a so-called \"proof-of-stake\" consensus mechanism in 2022, may qualify as a security.\n\nIndeed, if the SEC approves the Ethereum ETFs on Thursday without the staking component, it doesn't negate the fact that Ethereum issued on today's proof-of-stake network may be a security in the eyes of the Commission. FOX Business reported in April that the SEC's Enforcement Division has been investigating Ethereum, its merge, and companies and individuals associated with it for at least a year.\n\nWhile the SEC maintains outside political factors do not influence it, there's no doubt crypto has become an increasingly political issue in recent weeks.\n\nSPOT BITCOIN ETFS: HOW TO INVEST AND WHAT IT MEANS\n\nThe Biden Administration, including Senate Democrats such as majority leader, Chuck Schumer (D-New York), appear worried that Republicans and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump could seize on the growing popularity of digital assets, particularly among young voters, and use the administration's crypto crackdown to win votes and take the White House and possibly the Senate.\n\nLast week, Schumer led a group of twelve Democrats to vote to repeal a controversial SEC rule that would limit the ability of crypto companies to get fair access to the banking system. The 60-38 vote to repeal was widely regarded as a breakthrough moment for the industry, who until recently, has grappled with a Democratic party that's shown unwavering support for Gensler and his regulatory crackdown on crypto.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House is scheduled to vote on a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, a base for establishing clarity for crypto companies and investors."

Currently, VanEck's ETF is designated as inactive on the DTCC website, indicating it cannot be processed until it secures the required regulatory approvals.\n\nNotably, VanEck is not the first Ether ETF listed by the DTCC; Franklin Templeton's spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF was listed on the platform a month ago.\n\nThe DTCC's list includes both active ETFs that can be processed and those that are not yet active.\n\nThe final SEC decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF application is expected by May 23.\n\nAfter months of speculation about a likely denial of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC took significant action earlier this week by asking financial managers to amend and refile their 19b-4 filings on their proposed spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThis move has been interpreted by some analysts as a positive indication, raising the potential approval chance to 75% from 25%.\n\nIn a parallel development, Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has filed an updated 19b-4 form for BlackRock\u2018s BLK spot Ethereum ETF, with other amended filings also coming in.\n\nNasdaq submitted the amended form for the world's largest asset manager on Wednesday, while Exchange CboeBZX filed revamped 19b-4 forms late Tuesday for five spot ETF proposals.\n\nThese amended filings followed the SEC's request for exchanges to revise their 19b-4s earlier this week.\n\nAlso Read: White House Won\u2019t Veto Crypto Bill, But Seeks Stronger Consumer Protections\n\nForm 19b-4s notify the SEC about a proposed rule change and need the agency's approval before spot ether ETFs can become effective.\n\nAdditionally, S-1 registration statements would need to be approved before the funds can start trading.\n\nNasdaq's latest filing includes language similar to other amended 19b-4s regarding staking, indicating that the Fund\u2019s ETH cannot be staked.\n\n\u201cNeither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Ether Custodian (as defined below), nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust's ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,\u201d according to BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nAdding to the flurry of activity, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed on platform X that Grayscale GBTC has submitted a revised 19b-4 file for its Ethereum Mini Trust.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nThis event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.\n\nRead Next: Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations \u2018Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?\u2019\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

Bitcoin, the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency, yesterday rocketed to over $70,000 per coin. It\u2019s since dropped and is priced at $69,753.\n\nMeme coins and tokens have also surged, as have altcoins like Solana and Avalanche.\n\nLots of top asset managers have filed paperwork with the SEC to release a spot ETH ETF in the United States.\n\nIf approved, ordinary investors could get exposure to ETH by buying shares that track the price of the cryptocurrency, which is the second biggest by market cap.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Replying to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s celebration of the community\u2019s \u2018ideal of \u2018open discourse,\u2019 Fish\u2019s tweet, visible only to followers, reads:\n\nRead more: Ethereum centralization is becoming a serious problem\n\nConflicts of interest?\n\nEigenLayer ($18 billion) is the second largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by total value locked (TVL), after liquid staking platform Lido ($35 billion), according to data from DeFiLlama.\n\nRestaking has long been seen as potentially dangerous for Ethereum\u2019s consensus model, with Buterin authoring a blog post titled Don\u2019t overload Ethereum\u2019s consensus precisely one year ago.\n\nAs EigenLayer\u2019s documentation explains, restaking \u2018enables the reuse of ETH on the consensus layer.\u2019 By depositing ETH or liquid staking tokens, such as Lido\u2019s stETH, other projects can piggyback on Ethereum\u2019s underlying proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to benefit from what EigenLayer calls \u2018pooled security.\u2019\n\nHowever, using Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer for anything other than block validation could prove dangerous.\n\nThe major concern is known as the \u2018principal agent problem,\u2019 which Feist explains results from mismatched incentives in which a protocol\u2019s \u2018operator is not necessarily the same as the person providing the capital.\u2019\n\nA similar set of risks is posed by liquid staking protocols, which free up staked ETH to be used as collateral on DeFi lending platforms via a wrapper token. The aforementioned Lido has often come under criticism for capturing up to almost a third of staked ETH (currently 24%), and rejecting a governance vote to self-limit.\n\nDrake addresses this in his post: \u201cAs a researcher, I feel I did too little too late with regard to liquid staking. This is an opportunity to not repeat the mistake with restaking.\u201d\n\nBacklash\n\nAside from the potential dangers of EigenLayer itself, many have voiced their concerns over the nature of the disclosures. Firefox\u2019s Taylor Monahan pointed out that the timing wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\nDanger, the pseudonymous creator of TodayInDeFi claimed it\u2019s naive to expect the Ethereum community to believe that financial incentives won\u2019t result in a conflict of interest.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s why Ethereum 2 staking is risky and increases centralization\n\nAnd Rotki developer and open-source advocate Lefteris Karapetsas underlined the importance of \u201ccredible neutrality\u201d within the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe UK\u2019s first cryptocurrency exchange traded products are finally set to begin trading next week, almost a decade after the first such vehicles appeared in Sweden.\n\nWisdomTree, 21Shares and Invesco have been given the green light by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, to list ETPs investing in \u201cphysical\u201d spot bitcoin and ether, the two most popular digital tokens, on the London Stock Exchange on May 28.\n\nHowever, the ETPs \u2014 which form part of a barrage of similar vehicles expected to list on the LSE \u2014 will only be available to professional investors because the FCA has ruled that \u201ccrypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose\u201d.\n\nThe stance is in sharp contrast to stock exchanges across much of continental Europe, as well as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and the US, which offer crypto ETPs to both retail and institutional investors.\n\nUS-listed spot bitcoin ETFs already boast combined assets of $50bn, despite only launching in January, with about 80 per cent of this held by retail investors, according to regulatory filings.\n\nA series of other crypto ETP managers, including ETC Group and CoinShares, are known to have filed to list vehicles on the LSE, ideally also on May 28 if they receive regulatory sign-off from the FCA in time.\n\n\u201cThe FCA approval of our crypto ETPs\u2019 prospectus is a significant step forward for the industry and UK-based professional investors seeking exposure to the asset class,\u201d said Alexis Marinof, head of Europe at WisdomTree, which has $111bn under management globally.\n\n\u201cWhile UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point. FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will have fees of 0.35 per cent, the same as equivalent vehicles listed in a number of continental European exchanges.\n\nOphelia Snyder, co-founder of 21 Shares, which will cross-list its existing Bitcoin and Ethereum Staking ETPs in the UK, with fees of 1.49 per cent, said: \u201cLondon hosts one of the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world \u2014 where there is proven institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nInvesco will bring its $240mn Physical Bitcoin ETP, already listed in Germany and Switzerland, to London with a 0.39 per cent fee.\n\nAll the UK-listed crypto funds will be constructed as exchange traded notes, a structure common across the European cryptocurrency market. The FCA has only approved vehicles that invest in bitcoin and ether and which are unleveraged and physically backed.\n\nDespite the retail investor ban, issuers remain hopeful that there will be sufficient interest among UK-based professional investors to make cross-listing their ETPs in London worthwhile.\n\nMore than 900 institutional investors have built stakes in US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, SEC filings show, suggesting there may be an audience even for ETNs that are off-limits to retail investors.\n\n\u201cHedge funds and small family offices have always had an appetite [for crypto ETFs]. Private banks and discretionary fund managers are a little bit more hesitant, but they want to look at this asset class. Multi-asset managers are also looking at it,\u201d said Ravinder Azad, head of UK sales at WisdomTree. The company attracted 14 institutional investors to a UK crypto webinar earlier this year but already had more than 140 sign-ups for a follow-up event in June, according to Azad.\n\nBrown Brothers Harriman\u2019s 2024 Global ETF Investor Survey, released this week, found that in each of the US, Europe and Greater China, more institutional investors said they were bullish about the prospects for digital assets than any other asset class over the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, one crypto ETF issuer that has no plans to list a product in the UK while retail investors remain off limits told the FT: \u201cYou are launching a product that is not universal. It needs to be universal. That is the principle that underlies ETFs everywhere.\u201d"

This clearance enables the listing of 100% physically-backed ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), scheduled for May 28th.\n\nInitially, these products will be available exclusively to professional investors. The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs charge a management fee of 0.35%. Before this upcoming list, they were listed on Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse Xetra, the SIX Swiss Exchange, and the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.\n\nAlexis Marinof, the Europe head of WisdomTree, noted that the designation from FCA has been a significant part of UK professional investors\u2019 adoption of crypto-values. He also said that certainty of approval might increase institutional participation by eliminating certain rules deeming this asset class off-limits.\n\nHaving been established back in 2019, the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP was the first institutional-grade physically collateralized ETP that sought to offer European investors negotiable certificates representing physically stapled Bitcoin.\n\nThe firm now offers a diverse portfolio of eight such crypto ETPs, providing direct price exposure to individual cryptocurrencies and the crypto market. This development represents a major step forward in both the accessibility and regulatory approval of cryptocurrency investments in the UK."

[May 21st\u2019s] move was just the market repositioning and shorts closing (see open interest chart below), as almost nobody had been expecting an approval.

The market would likely shift back into \u2018you really are a genius mode.\u2019 With ETH leading for a while. Even after today ETH/BTC is still red year-to-date.

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Chainlink Are Soaring - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A potentially historic decision is benefiting Ethereum and several other cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) surged more than 25%, rising from just $3,000 to more than $3,700 at one point. This bullish momentum is primarily driven by growing anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), a development that could have profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC's shift and expedited revisions\n\nFor a long time, the approval of an Ethereum ETF seemed like a distant possibility. Many analysts and market participants believed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wouldn't greenlight such an ETF, as they believed it to be a security and not a commodity like Bitcoin (BTC -1.35%), which received its own spot ETF approval in January this year.\n\nHowever, sentiment has shifted dramatically. Rumors are swirling that the SEC has requested several applicants to expedite their revisions to their 19b-4s. These applications, which are essential for listing new ETFs, must be corrected, allowing for the final approval with an S-1 application and thereby pave the way for the ETFs to start trading.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\n\nThe prospect of an Ethereum ETF is significant for several reasons. First, it would provide investors unfamiliar or uncomfortable navigating crypto exchanges and digital wallets an easy way to invest. If approved, then investors can buy the Ethereum ETF off their preferred brokerage, just as with any other stock.\n\nYet the most important aspect of a potential approval comes in the form of institutional investors. Currently, institutional investors face several hurdles when attempting to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, including custody concerns, regulatory uncertainties, and market volatility. An ETF would alleviate many of these issues, making it easier for institutional capital to flow into the Ethereum market.\n\nWith easier access, it is expected that the deep pockets of institutional investors could cause Ethereum's price to soar. The Bitcoin ETFs were already some of the most successful ETFs ever launched, and if Ethereum follows a similar path, it could result in a significant price surge.\n\nRipple effect on other cryptocurrencies\n\nWhile the focus is primarily on Ethereum, the positive sentiment has spilled over into other cryptocurrencies. Solana (SOL -0.70%), Avalanche (AVAX -0.86%), and Chainlink (LINK -1.39%) have all seen their prices rise by more than 25% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThese cryptocurrencies, often referred to as \"altcoins,\" have been subject to heightened scrutiny lately because of their similarities with Ethereum, namely their proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Many agency officials believe proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies are closer to a security than to a commodity. But with a potential Ethereum ETF approval this opinion might be changing and could give a boost to other proof of stake cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnalysts' predictions and timelines\n\nWhile the approval of an Ethereum ETF is not yet guaranteed, analysts currently estimate a 75% chance of approval. This optimistic outlook is based on the SEC's recent actions and the growing recognition of Ethereum's importance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the earliest the ETFs could start trading is around the end of June. Applicants will need to revise and correct their applications, a process that typically takes several weeks.\n\nThe potential approval of an Ethereum ETF represents a monumental shift in the regulatory landscape, offering a more accessible and secure investment vehicle for both retail and institutional investors. While the final decision is still pending, the current sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, and the approval could mark a new era of growth and adoption for the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Yesterday, at 9.00 pm, the price of ETH soared registering an hourly candle of +9.2% following the news leaked on X regarding an approval by the SEC of Ethereum spot ETFs on Wall Street by Wednesday.\n\nAccording to reports from Bloomberg and Coindesk, the chances of an imminent introduction of this investment product on US exchanges have suddenly increased from 25% to 75%, fueling wild speculation on the cryptocurrency.\n\nNow ETH has continued its bullish run up to 3,700 USD and could soon pay another visit to the 4,000 USD area: volatility coming in the next few days.\n\nEverything you need to know below.\n\nThe chances of SEC approval for the ETF ETH are increasing\n\nUntil a few hours ago it seemed like just a mirage, now instead the chances of seeing the Ethereum spot ETF approved on Wall Street have increased dramatically after the latest breaking news arrived on X yesterday evening.\n\nAs publicly reported by Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, suddenly the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be strongly inclined to definitively approve both form 19b-4s and the S-1s registration statement for the requests of several investment funds in relation to the fillings submitted in recent months to the US market watchdog.\n\nAs confirmed also by colleague James Seyffart, and by ETFStore president Nate Geraci, at the center of this change in perspective by the federal agency there seem to be political motivations, with President Biden who seems to want to appear more crypto-friendly in view of the US presidential elections in November.\n\nSuddenly the odds of approval for the Ethereum spot ETF by the May 23 deadline have jumped from a mere 25% to 75% (Bloomberg Odds).\n\nUpdate: @JSeyff and I are increasing our odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they'd be denied). See\u2026 https://t.co/gcxgYHz3om \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 20, 2024\n\nJust an hour after the news spread by Balchunas, the information portal Coindesk published an article reporting some rumors from 3 different sources close to the SEC, according to which Gary Gensler and company would be asking requesting funds to quickly update the 19b-4 documents by Wednesday.\n\nThis in itself does not necessarily imply approval by the deadline date, considering that in addition to 19b-4 the SEC must carefully review the S-1 documents, and it may take longer than expected before giving a final response.\n\nCoindesk also reports that a company in negotiations with the federal entity believes that the market is on track for an imminent approval, and that ETH will not be considered as security.\n\nThe soap opera of crypto ETFs continues, started at the beginning of the year after the fake news emerged about a supposed approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, then denied by the SEC and finally confirmed a couple of weeks later.\n\nIn this case, given the reliability of the sources, we exclude the hypothesis fake news but remain on alert until the actual communication from the SEC.\n\nWe do not exclude a postponement, precisely for the reasons mentioned above regarding the S-1 document theme, and consequently a negative market reaction, with the price of ETH that could be strongly affected downwards.\n\nAll eyes are on the next two days, especially on the date of Thursday, March 23, deadline for the request of the ETF by Vaneck, even if as Bloomberg analysts affirm, the official announcement could arrive as early as Wednesday.\n\nEthereum price rises by 20% in one day thanks to the news on ETFs: local peak coming\n\nFollowing the news on the ETF ETH, with the chances of approval drastically increasing from one moment to the next, the price of Ethereum has increased sharply in just a few hours.\n\nFrom 9:00 pm yesterday until now, ETH has grown by 17.81% going from 3,150 USD to the current 3,714 USD.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the price evolution has an impact of 20%, with volumes exploding by +255%: we are talking about one of the most extreme pumps in the last years in the history of Ethereum.\n\nHourly chart of the price of Ethereum (ETH/USD), Coinbase market\n\nAs user X \u201cbx1core\u201d points out, in less than a day about 70 billion dollars of market capitalization have been added, almost as much as the entire market value of Solana.\n\nThis highlights how investors are bullish on the second largest cryptocurrency in the sector, and how their short-term sentiment depends on decisions regarding the approval or rejection of the spot ETF.\n\nIndeed, the news of an approval could bring, as happened analogously with Bitcoin, a strong inflow of institutional capital with consequent increase in the price of the underlying asset.\n\n$ETH literally added Solana\u2019s entire marketcap in one single candle\n\n\n\nSit down the king is home pic.twitter.com/eDziukrHw1 \u2014 bx1 (@bx1core) May 21, 2024\n\nIn a blink of an eye, the market outlook of Ethereum changes completely: with the latest rally, the chances of a breakout of the local high at 4,090 USD also increase in the coming days and of a subsequent breakout of the historical high set at 4,860 USD.\n\nIf the ETF is approved definitively, we could celebrate an event that will be remembered for a long time, whose effects will be visible even in the next 10 years.\n\nNow, however, maximum attention to short-term manipulations: those who know the crypto market well know that these are tempting opportunities to generate extreme volatility, perfect for making stellar gains or printing solemn losses.\n\nDO NOT BETRAY the EVENT: despite the news emerged, betting on the rise or fall at the same time as the deadline date is like flipping a coin.\n\nInstead if the goal is to accumulate ETH, a winning strategy could be to place a buy order in the price range from $3,200 to $2,900.\n\nOpen eyes and eye on market volatility: stay safe traders!"

        "content": "The revised odds of an Ethereum ETF approval have buoyed Ethereum-correlated assets.\n\nInvestors in Grayscale's Ethereum Trust have bought up its discount in anticipation of an ETF approval.\n\nEther-correlated assets are surging after a surprise turnaround on the likelihood of an Ethereum spot ETF approval from Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nWhile Ether itself rallied 22% to $3,800, several other assets have outpaced it.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust has in recent months become a gauge among traders for the likelihood of an Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nThat\u2019s because the investment product, which launched in 2017, cannot be redeemed for the Ether tokens that back it. The lack of redemptions has meant that the trust has traded below its net asset value \u2014 or NAV \u2014 for most of the past two years. It traded at a steep 20% discount on Friday.\n\nIf the SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs, however, Grayscale can convert its trust into an ETF. That\u2019s what happened with GBTC, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust Fund.\n\nBecause ETFs can be redeemed for their underlying assets, that would allow traders to quickly arbitrage the discount to NAV, as they did when Grayscale converted its Bitcoin trust to an ETF in January.\n\nAfter the recent rally, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust now trades over the counter at %2.7 premium to its backing, indicating that traders believe a conversion into an ETF is likely a done deal.\n\n\u2018Ethereum betas\u2019 rally\n\nLiquid staking protocol Lido\u2019s LDO governance token is among the biggest gainers, rising 31%.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLido's LDO token surges on Ethereum ETF hype.\n\nOther popular Ethereum DeFi tokens, such as Uniswap\u2019s UNI and Aave\u2019s AAVE, have also jumped, but not as much as Ether or Lido.\n\nAs the biggest DeFi protocol on Ethereum with $35 billion of deposits, traders often look to Lido as Ethereum beta \u2014 a trading term for assets that react more sharply to price moves in a correlated asset, in this case, Ether.\n\nAnother popular Ethereum beta is memecoin PEPE, named after comic artist Matt Furie\u2019s popular Pepe the Frog character. It\u2019s the second-biggest memecoin on Ethereum after Shiba Inu.\n\nPEPE gained more than 34% on the revised ETF odds, hitting a new all-time high. It now has a market value of over $5.3 billion.\n\nRevised odds of an Ethereum ETF approval send PEPE to an all-time high.\n\nOther Ethereum-related assets, such as crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust, have also benefited. After a 31% gain, it\u2019s now trading above its net asset value per share of $32.56 for the first time since March.\n\nThe moves upward comes after Balchunas revised his odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission will greenlight an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund this week to 75% from 25%.\n\nIn an X post, the analyst said he was \u201chearing chatter this afternoon that the SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone is scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they\u2019d be denied).\u201d\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "WisdomTree's ETPs offer low-cost, regulated crypto exposure with a 0.35% TER.\n\nShare this article\n\nWisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor, has secured the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) approval to list its WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to a press release published today. The listing, expected to occur on May 28, will initially cater exclusively to professional investors.\n\nAs previously reported by Crypto Briefing, May 28 is also expected to be the debut date of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on the LSE.\n\nThis move positions WisdomTree among the first to receive FCA endorsement for a crypto ETP prospectus. Institutions in Europe can now gain exposure to crypto backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, via these ETPs.\n\nWith a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of just 0.35%, WisdomTree\u2019s upcoming crypto ETPs are among the most cost-efficient options for investors in the region.\n\nCommenting on the latest development, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, said the FCA approval not only facilitates easier access for UK investors but also removes the regulatory hurdles that previously discouraged investors from entering the market.\n\n\u201cWhile UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point,\u201d Marinof stated.\n\n\u201cFCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty \u2013 we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs\u2019 prospectus to remove those barriers to entry,\u201d he added.\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s commitment to providing secure, regulated investment vehicles for crypto assets began in 2019 with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP.\n\nThe firm has since expanded its offerings to encompass a suite of eight physically backed crypto ETPs. These ETPs provide exposure to both individual cryptocurrencies and diversified baskets, and are available for trading on multiple European exchanges.\n\nIn March this year, WisdomTree announced it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves.\n\n[Update with context in the second paragraph]"

        "content": "Tue 21 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nWhile Ethereum seemed on the brink of oblivion, its price rebounded by nearly 20%. Let\u2019s examine the future prospects for ETH together.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Situation\n\nAfter facing downward pressure that pushed it down to $2,900, the Ethereum price stabilized at this price level. It took waiting until the week of the final deadline for the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs by VanEck, 21Shares & ARK, for the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility to increase. Fortunately for Ethereum, expectations that became more optimistic on Monday, May 20, allowed the cryptocurrency to appreciate by over 20%. Thus, Ethereum reached a resistance level of $3,700, as noted in the analysis of May 9, 2024.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, one Ether is worth $3,650. It seems that the cryptocurrency is now stabilizing below its resistance level. These recent bullish fluctuations have allowed ETH to position itself again above its 50-day moving average, which could reassure investors about the cryptocurrency\u2019s trend. On the side of Ethereum\u2019s momentum, a notable recovery can be observed, as evidenced by the oscillators and the price of Ethereum itself. All these elements thus seem encouraging for the continuation of this movement.\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market. Today, he is a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of proprietary traders active since 2017. There you will find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around financial markets in a professional and warm atmosphere.\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf the Ethereum price remains above $3,400, we could anticipate a breakthrough of $3,700. The next resistance to consider would be $3,900, or even $4,100. If the bullish movement continues, a new high at $4,400 could be marked. If Ethereum\u2019s momentum accelerates, it would not be impossible for Ethereum to reach its all-time high around $4,800. At this stage, it would represent an increase of over 31%.\n\nIf the Ethereum price fails to stay above $3,400, a return around $3,100 could be considered. The next support to consider, if the bearish movement continues, would be in a price range around $3,050. At this stage, it would represent a decrease close to -17%.\n\nConclusion\n\nFollowing a period of decline, Ethereum has experienced a remarkable recovery, supported by optimistic expectations related to the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs. This positive momentum, illustrated by reaching a key resistance level and a regain of confidence among investors, suggests an encouraging trend for the cryptocurrency. However, we will have to wait for official announcements to confirm the acceptance of these ETFs and, consequently, the continuation of enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency. Thus, it will be crucial to closely observe the price reaction to different key levels to confirm or refute the current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant in the face of potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let us remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe as-yet-identified attacker behind Monday\u2019s $240 million Gala Games token exploit has returned the Ethereum (ETH) gained from selling some of the tokens, as Gala reckons with the fallout from the attack and how to address lingering questions.\n\nApproximately 5,913 ETH, or about $22 million, was sent back from the attacker\u2019s wallet to a Gala wallet on Tuesday morning, representing the funds earned from selling 600 million GALA tokens on decentralized exchange Uniswap shortly after Monday\u2019s exploit.\n\nIn Gala\u2019s Discord server Tuesday, CEO Eric \u201cBenefactor\u201d Schiermeyer said that the firm will \u201cprobably buy and burn\u201d GALA tokens using the recovered ETH\u2014a move that could potentially drive up the price of the token following Monday\u2019s dip.\n\nOn Monday, Schiermeyer wrote in a Discord announcement that the crypto gaming startup believed it knew who was behind the attack, and said it was working with authorities to bring the attacker to justice. The person in question has yet to be publicly identified, and Gala Games would not comment further beyond published statements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGala published a blog post recounting the attack and the firm\u2019s countermeasures on Tuesday. A wallet with administrative access to the GALA token minting contract minted 5 billion GALA tokens on Monday, or about $240 million worth at the time of the exploit, and then proceeded to start selling them on the open market.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, Gala was able to block the wallet from making any further sales thanks to a function built into its v2 contract upgrade from last fall. The attacker was able to sell 600 million GALA tokens before that happened, and the price of GALA plunged by 20% during that span as the market contended with the flood of tokens.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure our community that the minting capabilities of $GALA on GalaChain remain secure and uncompromised,\u201d the post reads. \u201cOur internal controls and multisig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents, and we are continuously enhancing them to stay ahead of potential threats.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udce2 Important Update We recently detected and addressed a security incident involving $GALA tokens. Thanks to our network\u2019s robust security, the situation was quickly under control. Your GalaChain assets and $GALA Ethereum contract are secure.https://t.co/O3himruM4E \u2014 Gala Games (@GoGalaGames) May 21, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, while the firm claimed that the contract is secure, Schiermeyer previously wrote on Monday that Gala had \u201cmessed up\u201d in regards to access to such functions.\n\n\"We messed up our internal controls... this shouldn't have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't ever again,\" he wrote Monday.\n\nWhat about the other 4.4 billion GALA tokens? That\u2019s nearly 9% of the total supply of 50 billion GALA tokens, and they currently sit frozen inside of the attacker\u2019s wallet. On Monday, Schiermeyer wrote that they would be considered \u201ceffectively burned,\u201d as they\u2019re inaccessible and can\u2019t be spent.\n\nIn other words, the Gala ecosystem would consider them removed from circulation. But now, it appears that Schiermeyer\u2019s classification was premature, and the community of Gala network node operators will have the opportunity to vote on the question.\n\n\u201cA new Founder\u2019s Node ecosystem governance vote will soon decide if the blocklisted GALA will be considered burned as it relates to GALA\u2019s dynamic supply distribution model as described in the Gala Ecosystem Blueprint,\u201d the post reads.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nThe price of ether has jumped more than 16 per cent on speculation that US regulators will give the green light to stock market funds that invest in the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe sharp rise, which began last night, caught many traders by surprise as most had expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay or reject the first ether exchange traded fund by a Thursday deadline. Bitcoin also rose 6 per cent overnight to just over $71,000.\n\nThe renewed pressure on the SEC comes after the agency in January gave approval to exchange traded funds that invest bitcoin, giving way after years of delays. The spot bitcoin ETFs have drawn more than $10bn into funds run by assets managers such as Fidelity, BlackRock and Ark Investment Management, and helped fuel bitcoin\u2019s rise to a record high of more than $73,000 in March.\n\nEther hit a six-week high of $3,700 after several media reports said issuers had been asked by the SEC to file amended applications for their spot ether ETFs.\n\n\u201cGiven the radio silence and lack of [SEC] engagement on the filings, consensus was that an ether exchange traded fund would be denied,\u201d said Gautaum Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein.\n\nThe first decisions, on funds run by VanEck and Ark Investment Management, are due on Thursday and Friday respectively.\n\nBut analysts said this first stage of the approval process might not mean investors could shortly start trading the funds. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a financial adviser, said on social media site X that the SEC had no deadline to sign off the second, final stage.\n\nChhugani said the political dynamics around crypto in Washington were shifting, after 18 months of regulatory crackdowns and Democrat-led blocks to regulation.\n\nHe noted that former president Donald Trump had hosted an event for crypto enthusiasts and last week Congress agreed to overturn a controversial accounting rule that penalised banks wanting to hold digital assets for customers.\n\n\u201cAll of these, in our view, have likely caused a last-minute change of heart in the incumbent administration, perhaps realising the anti-crypto stance may turn out to have a political cost,\u201d he said.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency linked to the ethereum blockchain, which is widely used as the platform for building new cryptocurrency projects. Its technology can hold assets and enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts.\n\nSeveral other asset managers also have filed applications with the SEC for ETFs that invest directly in ether, including Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, said he expected the price of ether to rise to $8,000 by the end of the year as \u201conce investors realise ETH is the \u2018big tech\u2019 of digital assets they are likely to embrace it\u201d."

        "content": "The crypto space is buzzing as the deadline for the SEC's decision on the spot Ethereum ETF looms this week, with a decision expected as early as May 23. Adding to the excitement, top industry analysts have increased the probability of approval from 25% to 75%. This optimistic outlook has already had a notable impact on the market, with Ethereum's price surging more than 20% in just one day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent cryptocurrency expert Raoul Pal has weighed in on the potential of this development. He highlighted a scenario where substantial demand for the ETF, coupled with the fact that 30% of Ethereum remains staked and ongoing burning processes make supply deeply negative, could create what he describes as a \"banana zone squared.\"\n\nThis term refers to a period of exponential growth and market imbalance driven by rapid crypto adoption and significant increases in market capitalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne more thing I've been talking about for a while... what the hell happens to the price of ETH if there is big demand for the ETF and 30% remains staked (off market) and burning makes supply deeply negative as activity rises.... that could create a banana zone squared... \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) May 21, 2024\n\nAccording to Pal, if these conditions come to fruition, Ethereum could see unprecedented price increases. He suggests that this scenario is already unfolding and predicts that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will experience a massive boom once ETH reaches a new all-time high.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThis prediction is particularly noteworthy given Ethereum's previous peak of $4,868, achieved on Nov. 8, 2021. With the altcoin's price currently less than 29% away from this ATH, the stage seems set for significant market activity.\n\nPal's forecast adds a layer of excitement to the already heated discussions surrounding Ethereum and its potential. As enthusiasts eagerly await the SEC's decision, the prospect of a new ATH and subsequent NFT explosion is fueling fear and greed within the crypto community.\n\nIf Pal's predictions hold true, the coming weeks could mark a historic period for Ethereum and the broader digital asset market."

        "content": "Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) volumes surged to record highs on Tuesday, as Ethereum had experienced the biggest daily bullish candle the previous day when its price surged from $3,070 to $3,661.\n\nData from TheBlock shows that all three Ethereum futures ETFs, EETH (ProShares Ether Strategy ETF), EFUT (VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF), and AETH (Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF), saw record trading volumes on Tuesday, reaching a total of $47.7 million.\n\nEETH, which is traded on the NYSE Arca at a price of about $80 per share, has the largest share of the three. It saw its trading volumes surging from about $1 million on May 2 to over $43 million on May 21.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust, traded on over-the-counter markets with the ticker ETHE, saw its daily trading volume soaring to $687 million, the highest since H1 2021. ETHE\u2019s volume bounced from less than $30 million the previous week.\n\nThe sudden in Ethereum futures ETF trading volume has been driven by a spike in the price of Ethereum. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has outperformed Bitcoin this week amid the crypto market recovery, gaining about 20% on Monday alone.\n\nInvestors are growing confident that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally approve Ethereum spot ETFs later this month.\n\nOn Monday, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their expectations of spot Ethereum ETF approval from 25% to 75%.\n\nAll eyes are on the SEC, which will decide on Thursday, May 23, whether it gives the green light to VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application. While markets were certain that the SEC would postpone its decision for a later date, the regulator\u2019s requirement for VanEck to amend and refile its ETF filing was regarded as a positive sign.\n\nIf the SEC approves the first Ethereum ETF tomorrow, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may continue its bull run to new highs.\n\nStay on top of things:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter using this link \u2013 we won\u2019t spam!\n\nFollow us on X and Telegram."

        "content": "BlackRock, Bitwise and Grayscale join fellow issuers in submitting amended spot ETH ETF 19b-4s filings on Wednesday.\n\nSEC has begun discussions on S-1s filings as they may be delayed by a few weeks before approval.\n\nEthereum bulls appear to be conserving strength for next leg up as they await SEC approval.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is trading sideways on Wednesday as BlackRock, Bitwise and Grayscale submitted their amended 19b-4s filings to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency has also begun conversations with issuers on S-1s applications.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum continues to rally as five potential spot ETH ETF issuers have already submitted amended filings\n\nDaily digest market movers: Nearly all issuers have submitted amended filings\n\nEthereum is trending heavily across the crypto community as the SEC's deadline to comment on Van Eck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application is less than 24 hours away.\n\nBlackRock and Bitwise filed amendments for their spot Ethereum ETF 19b-4s on Wednesday. Hashdex is the only issuer yet to submit an amendment to its Ethereum ETF 19-b-4s. Grayscale also submitted amended 19b-4s filings for its Ethereum Mini Trust and Ethereum Trust after its initial filings on Tuesday.\n\nThe total number of issuers that have submitted amended 19b-4s filings include: BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, Van Eck, Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin and Invesco.\n\nThe 19b-4s filings are what national exchanges like the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submit to the SEC to seek approval for listing new products on their trading platforms. In the context of ETFs, S-1s refer to the initial registration forms detailing how a fund would be managed and track the underlying asset's price.\n\nWith Hashdex\u2019s filing left, the market has begun the countdown for the SEC's decision.\n\nRead more: Ethereum sees a 16% spike as Bloomberg analysts surprisingly increase approval odds to 75%\n\nWhile most of the recent updates have been on 19b-4s, Fox Business\u2019 Eleanor Terret said SEC staff have now begun conversations with issuers on their S-1s, \"with the conclusion being that there's work to do\" on those.\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart mentioned earlier that the approval of 19b-4s filings is only a part of the required approvals from the SEC, as the agency would also have to approve S-1 filings before spot ETH ETFs can launch. Seyffart suggested that while S-1 approval is a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d and not \u201cif,\u201d it may take days to weeks before the SEC approves them.\n\nConsidering the SEC's recent subpoenas to Ethereum-related firms and earlier silence on the ETFs, many have suggested that their 180 turn is political. Seyffart said the agency's recent change of mind may have been a decision from above, possibly US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe SEC approving spot ETH ETFs \"will be one of the biggest regulatory 180s in recent SEC history and proof that the crypto crowd is a legitimate voting block, securities lawyers tell me,\" says Fox Business Charles Gasparino.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum bulls await ETF approval\n\nEthereum traded around $3,737 on Wednesday as bulls appear to be conserving strength for a potential SEC spot ETH ETF approval on Thursday.\n\nThe $3,618 level serves as a support in case of a short-term downward move. ETH liquidation data also confirms that bulls may be slowing down, with over $28 million in long liquidations out of a total of $49.96 million worth of liquidations.\n\nAlso read: Week Ahead: Ethereum and DeFi to come under spotlight this week\n\nIf the SEC approves the spot ETH ETFs on Thursday, Ethereum may skyrocket over 30% to set a new all-time high above $4,878.\n\nThis aligns with predictions from Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, who said ETH could see much higher prices if the ETFs are approved as there would be less supply to meet demand. Bernstein analysts have also predicted that Ethereum may see a 75% surge to $6,600, similar to Bitcoin's 75% surge after its ETF approval."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nVitalik Buterin, the prominent co-founder of Ethereum, took to Twitter (aka X) to call for better interoperability between Ethereum layer-2 networks, suggesting that the ecosystem isn\u2019t \u201cunified\u201d amid a growing pack of networks that attempt to scale ETH in various ways.\n\n\u201cThe L2-verse doesn\u2019t feel enough like a unified Ethereum,\u201d Buterin said on Twitter. \u201cIt's much better than a year ago, but still far from perfect.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian programmer is calling for an \u201copen, decentralized, operator-free, governance-free protocol\u201d that will allow assets to be seamlessly bridged from one layer-2 network to another. This protocol should then be natively integrated into wallets, Buterin added.\n\n\u201cGet the basics done before getting too committed to any fancy toys,\u201d he said, in response to someone calling for more advanced optimizations of Ethereum scalability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe need an open decentralized (operator-free, governance-free) protocol for quickly moving assets from one L2 to another, and for that to be integrated into wallets' default sending interface. Get the basics done before getting too committed to any fancy toys. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 21, 2024\n\nCurrently, bridge options\u2014such as Optimism\u2019s Superchain\u2014are being built to allow assets to be moved from one chain to another. But that\u2019s just for chains building on the OP Stack. Buterin believes that having multiple solutions is damaging.\n\n\u201cWe need to get serious on doing this Ethereum-wide,\u201d he explained on Twitter. \u201cIf there are five separate solutions for five sub-ecosystems, that's needless fragmentation.\u201d\n\nHow could this be achieved? Buterin believes that alongside the Protocol Guild\u2014a collective of Ethereum contributors working to maintain and evolve the protocol\u2014the community should create a \u201cBasic Infrastructure Guild.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis new collective should aim to accelerate cross-layer-2 bridging solutions, develop zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs), and work on other \u201cpublic good\u201d infrastructure solutions.\n\n\u201cSet the standard that these things are ecosystem-wide public goods, and not products of individual companies,\u201d Buterin said on Twitter. \u201cThough like Linux, individual companies should absolutely be welcome to participate and even take initiative.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum took a big leap last night and early this morning on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked spot ETF applicants to submit revised 19b-4 filings.\n\nThe 19b-4 filings are what firms use to propose rule changes to the SEC. In this case, applicants would need the regulator to change their rules to allow for Ethereum spot ETFs to trade on exchanges.\n\nWhen this happened for spot Bitcoin ETF applicants in January, the industry was just days away from an historical approval of all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. There's no guarantee, of course, that things will play out quite the same as they did then. But sentiment around this week's upcoming deadline has taken a big swing and sent ripples throughout the market.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is holding above $3,600 and has seen volumes increase 219% in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStablecoin Open Dollar founder Joseph Schiarizzi noted on Twitter last night that Ethereum increased its market capitalization\u2014now $439 billion\u2014in 3 minutes by as much as half that of Ethereum competitor Solana.\n\nETH just added half of Solana's market cap in 3 minutes. \u2014 JOS\u039ePH \ud83c\udf69 (@CupOJoseph) May 20, 2024\n\nDelegate Labs and Clusters founder Foobar noted on Twitter that the spike in price had created the largest ETHUSD daily candle in history as the price went from $3,070 to $3,661.\n\nMeanwhile the open interest, or open ETH futures contracts, has swelled 26% in the past day to $15 billion. And call options\u2014which are opened by optimistic traders who think the price of an asset is going to increase\u2014outnumber put options almost 2:1, according to Coinglass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere's now $3 billion worth of open interest in Ethereum options that expire at the end of May and June.\n\nThe potential approval, or at least a step towards it, has gotten analysts wondering how the SEC could grant an approval while also fighting court battles over ETH's status as a security.\n\n\"If the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the Ethereum ETFs is true, I would guess they try to thread a needle between 'ETH' NOT being a security and 'staked ETH' (or even more flimsily, 'staking as a service ETH') as BEING a security,\" wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, wrote on Twitter.\n\nif the speculation about a 180 from SEC on the ethereum ETFs is true, i would guess they try to thread a needle between \u201cETH\u201d NOT being a security and \u201cstaked ETH\u201d (or even more flimsily, \u201cstaking as a service ETH\u201d) as BEING a security. that would be somewhat congruent with\u2026 \u2014 Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) May 21, 2024\n\nJust a month ago, Ethereum software giant Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC over its attempts to regulate ETH like a security. It was only a few weeks ago that court filings from that lawsuit revealed that a leaked internal memo from the SEC showed that the regulator has considered Ethereum to be a security for more than a year.\n\nIf the SEC does approve spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading, Singapore trading firm QCP Capital predicts ETH could quickly close the gap to $4,000 and rise as high as $5,000 before the end of the year.\n\n\"\u2060If not approved, we could expect an ugly move back to 3k,\" the firm wrote in a blog post. \"This uncertainty has resulted in higher volatility, but the better trade might be spot-futures basis which is now yielding above 10% again.\"\n\n(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt)\n\nAD\n\nAD"
