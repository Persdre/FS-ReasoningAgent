        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 5,000%, According to Cathie Wood - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The closely followed growth investor expects Ethereum to blast off.\n\nEarlier this year, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood stunned cryptocurrency investors by predicting that Bitcoin's (BTC -2.27%) price would reach $1.5 million by 2027. Wood believes the recent approvals of Bitcoin's first spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), more institutional purchases, and the impending halving of Bitcoin (which will make it twice as hard to mine the cryptocurrency) will all drive a stampede of bulls to the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Wood made an even more bullish prediction for Ethereum (ETH -0.40%), which currently trades at about $3,200. In Ark Invest's \"Big Ideas\" presentation early last year, Wood said Ethereum's market cap could exceed $20 trillion -- which would require a market price of more than $166,000 per token -- by 2032. Could Etherium's price actually soar by over 5,000% to hit that target?\n\nHow is Ethereum different from Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum is the largest cryptocurrency on the open-source Ethereum Network, which differs from Bitcoin (BTC -2.27%) in two key ways. First, miners can only mine for Bitcoin tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, but developers can create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum Network. That flexibility makes Ethereum a core pillar of the Web3 movement, which aims to disrupt centralized app platforms like Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play with decentralized applications and payment methods.\n\nSecond, Ethereum requires much less power to mine than Bitcoin. The Ethereum Network previously used the same energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method as Bitcoin, but it in September 2022, it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method. That transition, dubbed The Merge, reduced the network's total mining energy consumption by 99.95%. Ethereum bulls believe that upgrade will make it easier to expand the Ethereum Network and support more Web3 projects.\n\nWhat are Ethereum's main catalysts?\n\nEthereum is now the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It's also one of eight cryptocurrencies -- which include Bitcoin and six stablecoins from PayPal (PYPL -2.75%) and Gemini (GUSD) -- on the New York State Department of Financial Services' \"green list\" of pre-approved cryptocurrencies. That relative stability suggests the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might eventually approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHowever, the SEC recently reiterated its view that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified as a commodity instead of a security since it still uses the PoW method, which is comparable to physically mining precious metals. The SEC said the PoS method, while more environmentally friendly, makes the cryptos that use it more similar to derivatives contracts -- so Ethereum is more similar to a security than it is to a commodity.\n\nThe SEC also recently requested more information from the Ethereum Foundation, and it remains committed to reclassifying Ethereum and other Ethereum tokens as securities. That position implies the SEC probably won't approve any spot ETFs for Ethereum -- since commodities are more commonly valued by their spot prices -- in the foreseeable future.\n\nBut despite that, Ethereum's periodic burning of its tokens could stabilize its price in the near term. The upcoming upgrades for the Ethereum Network could also make it even easier to facilitate financial transactions and develop more decentralized tokens and apps. More companies could also begin accepting ether, the coin that powers the Ethereum blockchain, as a payment option, and institutional investors could accumulate more of the crypto -- even if it's not as easily accessible as Bitcoin through spot ETFs.\n\nShould you believe Wood's bullish prediction?\n\nInvestors should take Wood's $166,000 price target with a grain of salt. First, the famed growth investor has made plenty of wrong calls. Her firm's flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK 1.29%) has actually declined by 4% over the past five years as the S&P 500 rallied 76%. Ark also offers its own Ethereum futures ETF and is trying to get a spot Ethereum ETF approved, so Wood's opinion is arguably more subjective than objective.\n\nThat said, Wood adamantly believes the expansion of Ethereum's developer base and its potential to \"displace many traditional financial services\" and \"take share from existing financial intermediaries\" will drive its price toward her sky-high target of $166,000. I personally think Ethereum could come up far short of that lofty price in 2032 -- but it could certainly stabilize and head higher over the next few years if the Ethereum Foundation upgrades its network and keeps up with Bitcoin."

        "title": "No, ETH isn\u2019t suddenly a security now - Blockworks",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s sale of ETH since the September 2022 \u201cMerge\u201d constitutes an unregistered securities offering in violation of US law, according to Fortune.\n\nIf the reports are true, then this investigation \u2014 just ahead of the SEC\u2019s May deadline for a decision on an Ethereum spot ETF (more on that later) \u2014 raises the question: Did Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake transform it into a security?\n\nThe short answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThe slightly longer answer is \u201cstill probably no.\u201d\n\nETH tokens are not, in and of themselves, \u201csecurities\u201d in the way that stocks or bonds are. They do not confer legal ownership of any business entity or contractual rights to any kind of payments \u2014 they are just code in a decentralized database.\n\nWhen we talk about ETH \u201cbeing a security,\u201d we are instead actually asking whether the offer and sale of ETH tokens (in a particular context, between a particular buyer and seller) constitutes an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under the dreaded Howey test. Under the Howey test, the offer and sale of an asset like ETH constitutes an investment contract if (1) someone invested money, (2) in a \u201ccommon enterprise,\u201d (3) in the expectation of profit and (4) where that expectation is based on the \u201cessential managerial efforts of particular others.\u201d\n\nThe four Howey \u201cprongs\u201d have already been discussed and debated to death in the crypto space, so I\u2019ll avoid beating a dead horse here. But if you look closely at the language from Howey, I think two things quickly become apparent about the sale of ETH tokens over time:\n\nFirst, the sale of pre-mined ETH tokens to investors in Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO sure looks a lot like an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d ICO participants invested money (BTC) in order to receive their allocation of ETH (Howey prong #1). That BTC was pooled to fund a common effort led by Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation to develop the Ethereum blockchain and produce the ETH tokens (Howey prong #2). Given that the Ethereum blockchain \u201cpre-launch\u201d at the time of the ICO, the only plausible motivation to take part in the ICO was to make money on the price appreciation of ETH (Howey prong #3). And, at the time of the ICO, if Ethereum was going to succeed as a protocol and ETH was going to succeed as an asset, Vitalik and his developers were going to have to roll up their sleeves and put in some good old \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d to make the tokens worth anything (Howey prong #4).\n\nHad the SEC brought suit around the time of the Ethereum ICO, they would have almost certainly won in court, and that may well have been the end of ETH.\n\nHowever, the SEC didn\u2019t bring suit, and the statute of limitations for such a claim (typically five years) would have run out in 2019. And importantly, the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved in ways since its ICO that make current sales of ETH tokens look less like an investment contract than they once did.\n\nFor one thing, the proliferation of applications (think DeFi and NFTs) utilizing ETH for \u201cgas\u201d provides a \u201cconsumptive utility\u201d for ETH tokens that challenges the notion that current-day purchases of ETH are solely, or even mainly, based on profit expectation.\n\nEven more important, however, is the so-called \u201cHinman speech\u201d delivered in 2018 by Bill Hinman, then the director of corporation finance at the SEC, where he proposed that a digital asset\u2019s classification under Howey could evolve over time.\n\nAccording to Hinman\u2019s logic \u2014 to the extent that Ethereum\u2019s success no longer hinges on the efforts of a particular entity, like Vitalik or the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 the sale of ETH tokens would no longer fulfill the requirement of the final Howey prong that there be \u201cparticular others\u201d upon whose efforts a buyer would rely for their profits.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Staking or not, ETH is no security\n\nTherefore, regardless of the legally dubious nature of the ICO, the Ethereum network (at least from 2018 onwards) has become \u201csufficiently decentralized.\u201d This means that its native token constitutes a digital commodity like bitcoin, rather than an investment contract, subject to SEC jurisdiction.\n\nSince the Hinman speech, the securities law status of ETH has been at a bit of a stalemate. The SEC has never explicitly endorsed the notion that ETH (even pre-merge) is a digital commodity \u2014 which they readily concede with regard to bitcoin. And Gary Gensler regularly ties himself in knots before Congress trying to evade questions about his view on ETH\u2019s current legal status.\n\nBut the fact remains that (at least until now) the SEC has never brought an action specifically alleging that primary or secondary sales of ETH constitute investment contracts under Howey (like they did with over a dozen other tokens in the Coinbase, Binance and Kraken lawsuits). The SEC even went as far as to approve the listing of ETFs based on ETH futures contracts that trade on the CME, which would be hard to understand if the Commission felt that ETH tokens traded as unregistered securities.\n\nBut what about Ethereum\u2019s migration to proof-of-stake? Does the fact that ETH tokens can be staked for \u201cyield\u201d change the legal situation and turn either (A) current-day sales of ETH, or (B) the act of staking ETH into securities offerings under Howey?\n\nIn my opinion (and I spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about crypto securities law), no.\n\nWith regard to present-day sales of ETH tokens \u2014 whether directly from the Ethereum Foundation or on the secondary market \u2014 I don\u2019t think ETH\u2019s staking functionality makes much of a difference under Howey. That is, the ability to stake does not make ETH tokens any less useful for individuals who might buy them for their consumptive utility (i.e. gas fees).\n\nAnd while the Ethereum Foundation does indeed still hold a large supply of ETH tokens, there is no reason to think that the introduction of staking makes the foundation\u2019s \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d \u201cessential\u201d to the financial success of ETH in some way that was not the case at the time of the 2018 Hinman speech.\n\nThe question of whether the act of staking ETH in order to receive \u201cyield\u201d in the form of staking rewards constitutes an investment contract under Howey is more nuanced \u2014 but properly understood, the answer should still be no.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ether is the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat of crypto\n\nWhen you run a validator node and stake 32 ETH tokens in exchange for rewards, what you are actually doing is providing a service to the Ethereum network and getting paid for that service. You only get the reward if you honestly validate blocks, and you stand to lose your stake to \u201cslashing\u201d if you attempt to validate dishonestly.\n\nThis is very different from the type of passive \u201cyield\u201d you might expect to receive from holding a bond or a dividend-paying stock or real estate asset (which rewards ownership and not activity). Unlike with these traditional financial instruments, you are not relying on \u201cmanagerial efforts\u201d of other people in order to profit when you stake ETH directly, but rather on your own skill and honestly as a validator.\n\nThis question becomes trickier, however, when we move from direct proof-of-stake validation to \u201cstaking services\u201d such as those run by exchanges like Coinbase and collaborative staking protocols like Lido and Rocketpool.\n\nAt one end of the extreme, you could see an argument for how custodial staking services could look quite security-like under Howey (given how reliant depositors would be on the staking service provider\u2019s efforts in order to earn yield).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, you could imagine a purely on-chain tool that allowed users to jointly stake their ETH in collective, automated, validator nodes with clearly defined behavior looking much more like direct staking than an investment contract.\n\nWhere the specific services by Coinbase, Lido and Rocketpool fall on this continuum is very much an open legal question \u2014 and one that in Coinbase\u2019s case is being actively litigated in federal court in the Southern District of New York.\n\nBut none of this makes ETH itself, even when being used for staking purposes, an investment contract and therefore none of this seems to justify the SEC\u2019s new investigation.\n\nWhy, then, might the SEC be pursuing this type of weak claim about Ethereum?\n\nObserving the success of the Bitcoin ETF \u2014 and the SEC\u2019s dissatisfaction with its launch \u2014 suggests that the investigation into Ethereum might be a pretext to deny the upcoming spot ETH ETF application.\n\nMoreover, acknowledging Ethereum\u2019s transition to a commodity despite its seemingly illegal ICO genesis could concede a legal strategy meant to apply to other token projects that the SEC believes aiming to circumvent securities classification (in other words, creating a loophole).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s actions could be seen as a strategic move to maintain regulatory leverage over the crypto market, rather than a clear-cut determination of Ethereum\u2019s status as a security.\n\nZack Shapiro is the Managing Partner at Rains and leads the law practice.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Slipped Over the Weekend - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) remain three of the most-watched tokens for good reason. Unfortunately, onlookers have seen mostly downside price action over the weekend. Since market close on Friday, these three top digital assets have sunk 4.2%, 2.5% and 11.2%, respectively, as of 12:45 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nAn initial sharp decline was seen in all three tokens in early Saturday trading, in line with the reported escalation of the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. While each of these three tokens has made up some of this weekend's initial losses, it's clear that cryptocurrency is not immune from the geopolitical forces driving capital in and out of assets in times of uncertainty.\n\nThese moves are also significant because they come ahead of this week's expected Bitcoin halving, in which block rewards for miners will be cut in half. Typically, previous halvings have resulted in a booming price, which has bled into other crypto assets as well.\n\nBut given the anticipation around this rise, as well as capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, some investors appear to be betting that much of this rally might have already taken place, leading to caution heading into this key catalyst.\n\nLet's dive into some other key factors to consider when it comes to these three top tokens and their price action today.\n\nWhy all the negativity in the large-cap crypto space?\n\nBitcoin's move is perhaps most important to watch, as the largest cryptocurrency in the world heads into its latest halving, expected to take place on or about April 20. We'll have to see how the network responds, and how investors value the network as its inflation rate is halved yet again.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin did not rise on increased Iran-Israel tensions suggests that investors are continuing to view it more as a risk asset and less as a hedge against uncertainty. We'll have to see if this narrative shifts, particularly if some response from Israel is seen in the coming days.\n\nEthereum's move, while negative, has been the strongest of the three over the weekend. This is likely due to news that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved applications from three Chinese companies to list Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in Hong Kong.\n\nNo official report from the SEC has been released, but this could signal that a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the U.S. is likely to be seen in short order. For now, overarching macro concerns appear to be stealing the spotlight from this otherwise positive catalyst. I would expect Ethereum to continue to outperform its fellow large-cap tokens in the coming weeks, as investors price this catalyst in.\n\nStory continues\n\nDogecoin's double-digit move lower over the weekend once again exemplifies this token's nature as a high-risk and high-leverage bet on momentum within the crypto space. A lack of any meaningful rhetoric from Elon Musk (and negative sentiment building around Tesla and its recent layoffs and full self-driving announcements) have investors seemingly looking for other options in the crypto realm right now.\n\nIs there upside on the horizon this week?\n\nCertainly, there are a number of bullish catalysts that could take these three top tokens higher this week. The Bitcoin halving and the reported approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs should be broadly bullish for the top two cryptos by market capitalization (and Dogecoin by default).\n\nThe thing is, uncertainty remains high right now, and investors remain on edge waiting to see if we're heading into yet another war. The feeling in financial markets is glum right now, meaning these catalysts could be overshadowed by this overarching sentiment, at least in the short term.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these top tokens perform next weekend, as additional news arises around the two aforementioned key catalysts every crypto investor is watching right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

While this turbulence affected all digital assets, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, took a notable hit, experiencing an 18.43% decline, reaching a low of $2,852 per Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, amid the market chaos, a fascinating trend emerged \u2013 prominent players in the crypto sphere, often referred to as \"whales,\" showed unwavering confidence in Ethereum's potential. Notably, large addresses were observed accumulating substantial amounts of ETH during the price drop.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nWhale activities\n\nOne such whale, identified as \"0xE34,\" seized the opportunity to accumulate 1,000 ETH, worth approximately $3.15 million, from Binance at the market's lowest point. This particular address went on to accumulate an impressive 8,300 ETH, valued at around $25.12 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, another significant player, a wallet associated with Matrixport, made a decisive move by withdrawing 16,300 ETH, amounting to a staggering $51.1 million, from Binance amid the market turmoil. This wallet has been consistently withdrawing ETH from exchanges since March 29, accumulating a total of 67,286 ETH, valued at approximately $228.33 million, at an average price of $3,393.\n\nMatrixport, a prominent player in the crypto financial services sector, has been actively involved in facilitating digital asset management and trading for institutional and retail investors globally.\n\nThese substantial purchases of Ethereum during a period of market instability highlight the confidence of several major players in the potential of the leading altcoin.

        "content": "Ethereum fell against Bitcoin to its lowest point in three years amid the carnage that followed Bitcoin\u2019s fall from $70,000 over the weekend. The ETH-BTC chart reached as low as 0.0462 BTC on Saturday, April 13, down 24% from the year-to-date high of 0.085 BTC.\n\nEthereum\u2019s all-time high against Bitcoin came in 2017 when it touched 0.16 BTC before closing the year around similar levels to now at 0.048 BTC. It has since recorded lows around 0.018 BTC in late 2019 before rising significantly throughout the 2020 \u2013 2021 bull market.\n\nThe cycle peak of 0.088 BTC was met with a steady decline throughout 2023, 2022, and 2024. The 0.05 BTC level had been acting as a lower support level until it was breached this month. While the price remains within 7% of the support, it has been almost three years since we\u2019ve seen these prices.\n\nThe decline has been gradual and steady since the start of 2023, with a few bullish breakouts shut down within a couple of months.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains below the 0.05 BTC support level, it has recovered almost 7% from its weekend lows, holding relatively steady amid Bitcoin\u2019s continued struggles. Bitcoin fell from $70,000 to $61,700 over the weekend before recovering to $66,000. However, Bitcoin has retested $61,700 again and is trading around $62,000 as of press time. Ethereum initially followed Bitcoin down from $3,600 to $2,800 \u2013 it has since consolidated around the $3,000 mark, aiding it in its price war with Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the overall crypto market often follows Bitcoin, much of the altcoin market follows Ethereum. The ETH-BTC chart highly influences the delicate relationship between digital asset price movements, and it is one of the staples of the industry. Bitcoin dominance, another critical factor, reached a 3-year high this weekend, touching 57%, while Ethereum dominance dropped to just 15% from a recent high of 19%.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "With momentum carried over from the relatively smooth hard fork upgrades Shapella (Shanghai+Capella) and Dencun (Deneb+Cancun), Ethereum\u2019s next hard fork was supposed to be a breeze. Nevertheless, several analysts are waving red flags about one of its code changes, EIP-3074.\n\nThrough EIP-3074, Pectra will introduce codes that permit users to delegate all of their Ethereum assets to so-called Invokers \u2014 externally owned accounts (EOA) that users must trust to not steal their money.\n\nFollowing the naming convention of \u2018star + city portmanteau,\u2019 the upcoming hard fork Pectra (Electra+Prague) will introduce two new operation codes: AUTH and AUTHCALL. Together, these codes make up Ethereum Improvement Proposal number 3074 (EIP-3074).\n\nThe two codes are easy to understand. AUTH delegates power to an Invoker to conduct transactions while AUTHCALL calls that prior authorization to conduct subsequent transactions using that authorization.\n\nIncredibly \u2014 and for the first time in Ethereum\u2019s history \u2014 these two codes allow a third-party entity to send or transact Ethereum assets, including NFTs and ERC-20 tokens like USDC, inside your wallet forever. Unless developers modify the EIP before Ethereum hard forks later this year, the delegated powers remain with the Invoker permanently.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Foundation ditches \u2018warrant canary\u2019\n\nEIP-3074 gives wallet makers even more power\n\nAlthough further details of the AUTH and AUTHCALL codes are quite technical, a final item of general importance to most crypto participants is EIP-3074\u2019s entrusting of unprecedented powers to wallet makers.\n\nBecause Ethereum developers realize the expansive and permanent power of AUTH instructions to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), they have decided to limit the EOAs to which users may delegate their assets. Specifically, they have proposed limiting EOAs to a whitelist maintained by pre-approved wallet providers like MetaMask.\n\nThe solution to this blockchain problem? Trusted third-parties.\n\nEIP-3074: Trust us, bro.\n\nChainArgos CEO Jonathan Reiter explained Invokers\u2019 newfound powers in EIP-3074 even more explicitly, saying, \u201cI delegate authority over my account to an Invoker \u2014 something that can now call code over my assets \u2014 and that thing now has the ability to do stuff with my assets. And there\u2019s no way to revoke that delegation\u2026 The problem here is, because you can\u2019t revoke it, if I delegate to a contract \u2014 even if I think that contract is okay today \u2014 if it\u2019s upgradeable, they can steal my tokens in the future.\u201d\n\nSecurity researchers and auditors have raised similar concerns. Indeed, it\u2019s not enough for the user to simply ensure that they delegate only to presently trustworthy EOAs. If those EOAs are upgradeable smart contracts, the owner of those EOAs\u2019 private keys could swap honest code for malicious code in the future.\n\nWorse, even if an EOA is immutable, if that EOA interacts with additional smart contracts and those third-party smart contracts are upgradeable, EIP-3074 could expose users\u2019 assets to theft via malicious, third-party code upgrades in the future.\n\nRead more: Blast L2 hack prompts debate over centralization of Ethereum rollups\n\nWhy are we further empowering the most powerful?\n\nGiven all of these risks, what exactly is the point of EIP-3074 in the first place? Mostly, in the opinion of co-author Matt Garnett, the code will save users time and money \u2014 assuming Invokers stay honest. Consider a first-timer\u2019s experience using Uniswap. First they must manually sign to authorize Uniswap. Then they need to pay to activate ETH on Uniswap before signing up and paying gas to activate USDC. Then they sign and pay gas to swap ETH for USDC and if more assets are involved, each one must also be activated with a separate signature and gas fee.\n\nIn the post-Pectra hard fork world, many of these signatures and gas payments could consolidate. For the user, they would only sign once to AUTH an Invoker with permission to perpetually trade their ETH or USDC on their behalf \u2014 without subsequent signatures.\n\nIn summary, EIP-3074 adds more trust and power with centralized and already quite powerful corporations like MetaMask by Consensys. Unless developers rethink this software change, the upgrade will entice users to entrust perpetual authority with third-party Invokers. These entities may now control users\u2019 wallets and might, by way of their own or third-party smart contract upgrades, change the rules of the game in the future to simply steal users\u2019 money.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "With teams debuting their shiny new crypto projects every other week, navigating the world of crypto can be overwhelming for newcomers to the space. As you start to build a long-term, high-conviction trading strategy, it's likely you'll be researching prolific projects at the forefront of blockchain technology.\n\nOf today's crypto market leaders, two similar technologies that deserve exploring are major Layer 1 players Solana and Ethereum. As both Solana and Ethereum represent established Layer 1 blockchains backed by passionate communities and vibrant ecosystems, it can be difficult to separate the two given their strengths and unique selling points.\n\nEager for clarity? This guide aims to provide an objective comparison of Solana vs Ethereum as we demystify their technical attributes and explore what differentiates them. From exploring how each Layer 1 blockchain fares against the blockchain trilemma to understanding their future developments, here's everything you need to know when comparing Solana and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum is the first blockchain platform to popularize smart contracts and self-executing programs that power decentralized applications (DApps). The leap forward with autonomous smart contracts sparked a wave of development in the decentralized space and established Ethereum as a DeFi pioneer, where users can borrow, lend, and trade crypto without relying on traditional financial institutions. Beyond DeFi, Ethereum's robust ecosystem encourages fresh innovation across various sectors, ranging from NFTs and GameFi to real-world asset (RWA) marketplaces and prediction markets. Overall, Ethereum's established developer community, strong security measures, and ever-evolving feature set solidify its position as a leading force in the blockchain world.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nA next-generation blockchain that improves upon the innovations of its predecessors, Solana debuted in 2017 amid scalability bottlenecks and rose to prominence because of its Proof of History (PoH) function. By timestamping transactions in a decentralized manner, Solana nodes can organize transactions more efficiently, leading to rapid confirmation times and affordable gas fees. This makes Solana a haven for fast-paced DApps that demand high transaction throughput. Beyond speed and affordability, Solana boasts a vibrant developer community drawn to its user-friendly programming languages and its potential for on-chain scaling solutions. This dev-first focus has fueled the creation of innovative projects within the Solana ecosystem, including play-to-earn games with immersive experiences and serialized NFT projects that allow ongoing content updates.\n\nHow Ethereum and Solana fare against the blockchain trilemma\n\nBefore diving into our Solana vs Ethereum comparison, it's important to first understand the concept of the blockchain trilemma. In short, the blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin that suggests developers for decentralized blockchains will encounter three main factors: security, decentralization, and scalability.\n\nDespite their best efforts, developers will be forced to sacrifice one factor as a trade-off to meet the needs of the other two factors. One example of this would be Bitcoin. Known for its high level of security and decentralization, Bitcoin is often seen as the gold standard among decentralized networks. However, Bitcoin struggles with scalability, meaning it can only process a limited number of transactions per second. This is a major drawback for widespread Bitcoin mainstream adoption, as it can lead to slow transaction times and high fees.\n\nUltimately, understanding the blockchain trilemma is essential for evaluating different blockchain projects. Each project makes its own trade-offs between the three core principles mentioned above, and the ideal choice for you'll depend on your specific needs and priorities. Now that we have a clear understanding of the blockchain trilemma, let's dive into the security, decentralization, and scalability of Ethereum and Solana to see how these popular blockchains fare against such metrics.\n\nSecurity\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana prioritize security, employing robust mechanisms to safeguard user funds and network integrity. In both cases, validators stake their own tokens (ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana) to verify transactions. The potential loss of their staked tokens incentivizes validators to act honestly, as malicious behavior could result in penalties and loss of their stake. Ethereum's long history and battle-tested security measures inspire confidence in many users, but it's important to remember that security for any blockchain is an ongoing process, and vulnerabilities can still emerge. However, their approaches differ in their nuance of Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation. Ethereum's current PoS implementation is still under development compared to some established PoS blockchains, while Solana's PoS applies PoH alongside it.\n\nEthereum's security\n\nEthereum's current security relies on PoS, a consensus mechanism where validators stake their own ETH tokens to verify transactions. The potential loss of their staked tokens incentivizes validators to act honestly, as malicious behavior could result in penalties and loss of their stake. While the PoS implementation is a recent development, Ethereum's history with its previous Proof of Work (PoW) system and the ongoing security audits and improvements during its transition to PoS inspire confidence in its ability to protect user funds and network integrity. This established track record is a major advantage for users who prioritize a security model that's been thoroughly tested and refined over time.\n\nSolana's security\n\nSolana leverages a unique combination of PoH and delegated PoS (DPos) for security. PoH creates a verifiable record of time between transactions, preventing issues like replay attacks due to streamlined transaction ordering. Delegated PoS requires validators to stake not only SOL tokens but also Solana hardware, raising the potential cost of malicious activity. While Solana's security architecture is innovative and shows promise, its relative novelty compared to Ethereum's PoS system might lead some users to favor Ethereum's established track record.\n\nOverall, both Ethereum and Solana prioritize security with strong mechanisms to protect user funds. Ethereum's established track record with PoS inspires confidence in many users. However, Solana's innovative approach with PoH and bonded PoS offers additional security features and a potentially higher barrier to malicious actors. While Ethereum's PoS is well-understood, Solana's complex architecture with PoH may be less battle-tested, introducing the possibility of unforeseen vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the choice between these two platforms from a security standpoint depends on your individual risk tolerance and how you weigh a proven track record against advanced and disruptive features.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology. It refers to the distribution of power and control across a network, eliminating the need for a central authority. Both Ethereum and Solana aim for decentralization by applying the PoS consensus mechanisms. With PoS, validators who stake their own cryptocurrency tokens are responsible for verifying transactions. This economic incentive aligns validator interests with the health of the network, as malicious behavior could result in slashing and the loss of their stake. Additionally, both platforms aim to achieve a degree of resistance to censorship by distributing the validation process across a global network. This means no single entity can control or block transactions on the network.\n\nEthereum's decentralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is arguably one of the most decentralized in the world. With an estimated validator pool exceeding one million, Ethereum's validator base is constantly expanding, with plans to become even more distributed in the future. However, concerns remain about the potential influence of large staking pools that could hold a significant portion of the total staked ETH. As of writing, Lido dominates the staking landscape on Ethereum, controlling over 30% of staked ETH at one point. This concentration raises concerns about potential centralization, as Lido could potentially influence the network if it wanted to. Thankfully, the Ethereum team is actively working to mitigate this risk. The upcoming sharding upgrades as part of the Ethereum roadmap aim to further decentralize the network by increasing the number of validators required per shard. Overall, this will make it more difficult for any single entity to gain control, since the implemented upgrade will increase the number of validators required and lower the barrier to entry for individual stakers.\n\nSolana's decentralization\n\nAlthough Solana has been praised for its impressive throughput, its string of outages expose a potential vulnerability in this methodology. Solana adopts a different approach to decentralization and applies a DPoS system where validators are chosen based on factors like stake size and network performance. While this approach allows for faster transaction speeds, it also raises concerns about centralization as the validation power is concentrated among a smaller set of chosen validators.\n\nAdditionally, Solana's validator set is currently permissioned and employs a validator selection process with delegated PoS, meaning new validators need approval from the network to join. While this allows for faster transaction speeds, Solana's reliance on a specific set of validators for its PoH system raises questions about its true level of decentralization and reliability. This is especially true when compared to Ethereum's more geographically distributed validator network.\n\nThe perceived lack of reliability has also been underlined by Solana's network disruptions. To tackle this, Solana is working towards a permissionless validator set through its hotly anticipated validator client software, Firedancer. Firedancer implements Solana's version of PoS and aims to address some of the platform's current centralization concerns. By enabling anyone to run a validator node without prior approval from the network, Firedancer has the potential to significantly distribute validation power more evenly and greatly improve network decentralization in the long run.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Ethereum and Solana regarding decentralization depends on your priorities. If complete openness and permissionless participation are paramount, Ethereum might be the better choice despite its current scalability limitations. If faster transaction speeds are a priority, you might be willing to accept some centralization trade-offs with Solana, keeping in mind its ongoing efforts to become more decentralized in the future. However, if a technical issue or malicious attack disrupts the validator network, the entire Solana network can grind to a halt. This undermines the security and reliability of the platform, especially compared to more decentralized blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability refers to a blockchain's ability to handle a growing number of transactions without compromising processing speed or incurring high fees. This is a critical factor for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as expensive gas fees are often a deterring factor when it comes to regular usage and transactions. Scalability presents a contrast between Ethereum and Solana as each network has its own way of dealing with high transaction volume.\n\nEthereum's scalability\n\nAlthough it's established with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum has historically struggled with scalability due to its previous PoW consensus mechanism. This resulted in numerous scalability bottlenecks such as high transaction fees and slow processing times, which were major pain points for users looking to actively interact with Ethereum's ecosystem. In fact, it's this bottleneck that inspired many developers to strike out on their own and create their own scalability-focused Layer 1 blockchain, leading to the innovations in blockchain scalability that we see today.\n\nFortunately, the Ethereum Foundation has been hard at work upgrading the network with improved scalability in mind. From its PoS transition to numerous network upgrades like Dencun, the developments aim to significantly improve scalability by distributing the workload across multiple shards, potentially handling thousands of transactions per second. With the execution of its roadmap, we could see Ethereum reach a single block finality of 12 seconds. This is a fraction of its current 30-minute duration, and achieving this will dramatically improve the user experience and network efficiency.\n\nSolana's scalability\n\nMeanwhile, Solana is a high-performance blockchain that prioritizes scalability from its core design. Since its inception, Solana has had a laser-like focus on speed. Thanks to the network's introduction of innovations like PoH and tower byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), Solana is theoretically able to achieve a blistering throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second. On top of this, Solana also boasts gas fees that are mere fractions of a penny, making it significantly cheaper to interact with the network compared to Ethereum's historically high gas fees.\n\nThe combination of blazing-fast transaction speeds and negligible fees puts Solana's scalability in a league of its own compared to Ethereum's current state, as Solana is becoming the platform of choice for a wide range of DApps, particularly those requiring high throughput and cost-effectiveness. While Solana has yet to achieve its theoretical maximum throughput, it's certainly on its way to hitting this thanks to progress made with Firedancer. With its ability to process 600,000 transactions per second in test environments, Firedancer could be influential in markedly improving Solana\u2019s overall scalability.\n\nWhen considering scalability between Ethereum and Solana, both networks offer compelling options for developers and users seeking a scalable blockchain platform. While Ethereum focuses on a robust ecosystem and future scalability improvements with a strong emphasis on decentralization, Solana prioritizes raw speed and boasts impressive transaction processing capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Ultimately, the choice between these platforms depends on the specific needs of the project or user, with factors like transaction speed, cost, desired level of decentralization, and application type playing a key role in the decision-making process.\n\nSolana's potential threat to ETH dominance\n\nFor those unaware, ETH dominance refers to the ratio between the market cap of Ether to the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market. Like with Bitcoin dominance, ETH dominance is often used to track Ether's value relative to other big-name cryptocurrencies. This is used to signify how ETH fares against the competition.\n\nA chart showing ETH dominance (source: tradingview.com)\n\nA chart showing ETH dominance (Source: tradingview.com)\n\nReferencing the chart above, we can see that ETH dominance is currently on a downward trend. This is based on how a recent death cross was formed on the daily time frame as the 50-day moving average recently crossed under the 200-day moving average. Additionally, the relative strength index shows that ETH dominance is declining from its current value of 44.1. With these indicators in mind, we can conclude that ETH dominance could decrease in the near future, hinting that there might be a relative increase in the value of altcoins as traders rotate out of ETH into promising crypto projects and altcoins like SOL. This trend has also been a huge reason why crypto traders have been speculating that Solana might threaten ETH dominance over time as it offers a faster, more scalable alternative with significantly lower transaction fees. This speculation is further fueled by the ongoing developments of Solana's Firedancer validator client software, which aims to address concerns about decentralization and news of how Solana recently overtook Ethereum in terms of DEX trading volume.\n\nThe future of Solana vs Ethereum: can both Layer 1 powerhouses coexist?\n\nThe competition between two leading Layer 1 blockchains like Solana and Ethereum is fierce. While Ethereum boasts a robust and established ecosystem with a strong focus on decentralization, Solana offers blazing-fast transaction speeds ideal for high-throughput applications.\n\nAs both platforms continue to evolve, one important question emerges: can both Layer 1 powerhouses coexist in the future blockchain landscape? The answer might lie in specialization. Ethereum's upcoming sharding upgrades could address its scalability issues while maintaining its focus on security and decentralization. This would solidify Ethereum's strong positioning for complex financial applications and trading TradFi instruments like RWAs. Conversely, Solana's speed advantage could make it the go-to platform for applications requiring real-time transactions, such as DeFi markets with frequent trading or high-traffic GameFi titles.\n\nBeyond competition, we've seen a rise in cooperation between Solana and Ethereum. Thanks to the rise of decentralized interoperability bridging services like OKX Swap, both Layer 1 blockchains can seamlessly communicate with one another and enable asset transfers. We've even seen the emergence of shared developer tools and cross-chain projects fostering a more collaborative environment. Ultimately, the future might see a scenario where both Ethereum and Solana thrive, catering to different user needs and fostering innovation within the broader, interconnected blockchain space.\n\nFinal words on Solana vs Ethereum\n\nMany would agree that Solana may be the best option if speed, scalability, and low fees are important to you. This will likely be the case if you're interacting with high-frequency DeFi applications where every millisecond counts, or if you frequently trade Solana memecoins. However, if a robust and battle-tested ecosystem with a strong focus on decentralization is your priority, Ethereum might be the better fit. This could be ideal for DApps requiring greater security for valuable assets or projects seeking a more established user base and compatibility with existing Ethereum-based DApps.\n\nUltimately, the best approach might not be a \"which is better\" scenario. As the industry continues to develop, we might see increased interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. This would allow users to leverage the strengths of each platform seamlessly. For instance, imagine seamlessly transferring assets between Ethereum and Solana for lower transaction fees while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network. The future of blockchain development is bright, with both Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana leading the charge. By staying informed about their ongoing advancements, you'll be well-positioned to make informed choices as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve.\n\nKeen to trade either Solana or Ether? Check out our spot trading pairs for SOL and ETH to get started with your crypto trading journey today.\n\nFAQs about Solana vs Ethereum\n\nIs Solana faster than Ethereum?\n\nYes, Solana is significantly faster than Ethereum in its current state. Solana boasts theoretical transaction speeds exceeding 65,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum's current average of 15 to 45 transactions per second. This difference is due to Solana's unique architecture designed for scalability, while Ethereum is still undergoing upgrades to improve its speed.\n\nIs Solana cheaper than Ethereum?\n\nYes, Solana transactions typically incur significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum. Solana gas fees are a fraction of a penny, while Ethereum gas fees can fluctuate and sometimes reach high levels depending on network congestion.\n\nIs Solana more secure than Ethereum?\n\nWith its established and battle-tested network and a larger validator base that offers greater decentralization, Ethereum is generally considered more secure than Solana. This can also be seen in how often Solana faces network outages compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhy does Ethereum have higher TVL (total value locked) than Solana?\n\nTVL refers to the total value of cryptocurrency locked within DeFi protocols on a specific blockchain. Ethereum has a significantly higher TVL compared to Solana. This can be attributed to factors like Ethereum's first mover advantage that led to it having a more mature and established ecosystem. Specifically, Ethereum supports a wider range of DeFi applications and protocols, while the network effect could have caused the existing user base on Ethereum to attract further projects and users that reinforce its dominance in the DeFi space.\n\nCan Solana overtake Ethereum?\n\nThe future is, of course, uncertain. While Solana offers superior speed and lower fees as of writing, Ethereum is actively working on scalability improvements. Additionally, Ethereum's established ecosystem and user base are significant advantages. It's more likely that both platforms will coexist, with users choosing based on their specific needs. The rise of interoperability bridges could further enhance this coexistence by allowing users to leverage the strengths of each platform seamlessly."

This rate isn't fixed and can vary over time. You can check the latest applicable rates directly within your Coinbase account. Commission charges reduce your actual returns.\n\nRewards are distributed every four to five days after the activation period. However, the rewards may not settle in your account immediately because of network conditions. While the estimated reward rate gives you an idea of what you can earn, the actual rewards may take some time to reflect in your account.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Unstake ETH on Coinbase?\n\nTo unstake ETH on Coinbase, you follow a specific process. Once you initiate the unstaking action, your assets will enter an unbonding period. After this period ends, you can withdraw the asset. However, there's an additional step: unbonded assets must be included in a batch before withdrawal. You'll need to wait until the unbonding transaction is part of one of Coinbase's batch times.\n\nFor U.S. clients, batch times are Monday-Friday at 12:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. PST; and Saturday-Sunday at 2:00 p.m. PST. Non-U.S. clients have different batch times: Monday-Friday at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. GMT; and Saturday-Sunday at 4:00 p.m. GMT.\n\nUnstaking ETH on Coinbase involves an unbonding period followed by waiting for batch withdrawal times. Be aware of these timelines when planning to unstake ETH.\n\nCan I Sell Staked Ethereum on Coinbase?\n\nYou cannot directly sell staked Ethereum on Coinbase. You would go through the process of unstaking it first, which typically takes one to four days depending on network conditions. Once the unstaking transaction is processed, you'll be able to claim your funds and sell them.\n\nUnstaking and claiming are separate blockchain transactions, and both require gas fees, resulting in costs associated with both processes.\n\nIf you have staked Ethereum on Coinbase and want to move it, you have a couple of options. You can unstake it and sell it or you can wrap it into cbETH and trade it as a liquid staking token. However, cbETH trades at a discount, so if you're looking to sell at the full value of your staked Ethereum, unstaking and selling it may be the better option.\n\nCoinbase Stakers Earn Rewards\n\nStaking Ethereum on Coinbase offers a straightforward and accessible way for users to actively participate in the Ethereum network and earn rewards. With Coinbase's user-friendly platform, you can stake any amount of ETH, even as little as 0.01 ETH, without the need for a full Ethereum node. While there are potential risks and considerations to keep in mind, such as centralized exchange risks, commission charges and gas fees, the benefits of earning passive income, supporting network security and contributing to a more environmentally friendly blockchain ecosystem can make staking on Coinbase an attractive option for many investors."

It has $1 billion in AUM and recently seeked to raise funds at a $1 billion plus valuation. Shenzhen-based Bosera Capital is one of the first fund management companies in China, and manages $200 billion in assets. Meanwhile, China Asset Management is a prominent asset management firm founded in 1998. It manages one of the largest equity ETF products in China, with a total of $266 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBloomberg first reported about the imminent approval of the spot ETFs, with the listing details being finalized in time with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX). The report stated that the products could be launched by the end of this month, marking a significant development in the region's cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe approval of these ETF products in Hong Kong is anticipated to be a major driver for the cryptocurrency market, positioning the city as a leading digital asset hub in Asia. While the United States approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, resulting in a record-breaking price surge that propelled Bitcoin to reach $73,000, it has not yet approved Ethereum ETFs. In contrast, Hong Kong approved both Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs at the same time. Meanwhile, expectations for the approval of spot Ether ETF products in the U.S. remain subdued due to the lack of SEC engagement with the applicants. JPMorgan analysts placed the approval of Ether ETFs by the final deadline in May at 50%.\n\nFollowing the news of the approval, BTC surged 2.81% in the past 24 hours to trade at $66,526, up from the lows of $62,000. Meanwhile, ETH gained 4.88% and is currently trading at $3,246. The crypto markets had a brutal sell-off last week following escalating tensions in the Middle East, which propelled fears of a blown-out war."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nBenjamin Cowen, a crypto analyst and trader, has raised concerns about the potential significant price collapse of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent analysis, Cowen hinted at the possibility of a 60% plunge in the price of ETH, citing the loss of crucial support levels for the ETH/BTC trading pair.\n\nThe ETH/BTC trading pair, which compares the value of Ethereum to that of Bitcoin, is widely regarded as an important indicator of market sentiment and relative strength between the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Cowen's analysis, the recent loss of important support levels in the ETH/BTC pair could signal further downside for Ethereum's price in the near term.\n\nAccording to the crypto analyst, on the past two occasions, ETH/BTC broke major support, and the ETH/USD pair fell 60% from its previous local high in three to six months. He mentioned that ETH/BTC has just lost support, and the implications of this development are unknown presently.\n\nThe last 2 times that #ETH / #BTC broke support, #ETH / #USD dropped 60%+ from the prior local high over the next 3-6 months.\n\n\n\nAgain, #ETH / #BTC just broke support.\n\n\n\nNothing with investing is guaranteed, but please consider all outcomes. pic.twitter.com/RUMYEJwCaM \u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) April 16, 2024\n\nCowen's warning comes amid a period of heightened volatility and uncertainty on the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum experiencing fluctuations in its price and trading volume.\n\nThe loss of support for the ETH/BTC pair adds to the uncertainty surrounding the Ethereum price as it fights to maintain the crucial $3,000 level.\n\nETH was down 3% in the last 24 hours to $3,055 at the time of writing. According to crypto analyst Ali, the next critical support zone for Ethereum is currently between $2,000 and $2,430, where around 9.37 million addresses hold nearly 53 million ETH.\n\nWhile the prediction of a 60% drop made by Cowen is stark, it is important to realize that predictions are not certainties. While historical trends and potential outcomes might be crucial to consider, past performance might not indicate future results.\n\nIn separate news, the Ethereum community is debating a change to the ETH monetary policy in response to proposals aimed at limiting the staking pool's rapid expansion. This discussion was triggered after two Ethereum researchers proposed slowing ETH issuance and thereby reducing staking incentives."

        "title": "Halving 2024: How Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Furrever Token (FURR)\u2019s are Poised to Transform in the New ETF-Driven Market Landscape - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency community approaches the 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) halving, excitement builds not just for the potential effects on Bitcoin's price, but also for the broader implications for the market, including Ethereum (ETH) and emerging assets like Furrever Token (FURR) . This particular halving event, set for April 2024, coincides with significant market developments, notably the rise of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which could reshape investment strategies and market liquidity. Bitcoin's upcoming halving will reduce the reward for mining transactions by half, potentially constricting supply and influencing prices in a market that has already seen Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others like Furrever Token, make substantial gains. The interplay between these factors and the new dynamic introduced by ETFs could lead to unprecedented outcomes in the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving: A New Chapter in Crypto With the Rise of ETFs\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) community is poised on the brink of the 2024 Bitcoin halving, an event that could catalyze the cryptocurrency landscape. Scheduled for April 2024, this halving is not just another cycle in Bitcoin's existence but may mark a significant turning point for broader crypto adoption. Unlike previous halvings, the upcoming event coincides with the emergence of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), introducing a dynamic that could reshape market reactions post-halving.\n\nBitcoin's supply is finite, capped at 21 million coins. Every four years, the Bitcoin network undergoes a 'halving' where the block rewards given to miners are reduced by half. This mechanism decreases the rate at which new bitcoins are created, aiming to prevent inflation and preserve scarcity. Historically, each halving event has led to considerable bullish trends in Bitcoin\u2019s price. For example, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price escalated from around $12 to over $1,000 within a year. Similar patterns followed the 2016 and 2020 halvings, with prices peaking at around $20,000 and over $60,000, respectively.\n\nWhile past performance due to halving is notable, it's crucial to recognize that these price surges also aligned with significant global economic events, such as the European debt crisis, the ICO boom, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These events underscore the influence of broader economic contexts on Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior, indicating that halving impacts are intertwined with global economic health and investor sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 2024 halving introduces a novel factor that could significantly influence Bitcoin's market dynamics\u2014the approval and operation of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These financial products allow a wider range of investors to engage with Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency handling, potentially enhancing mainstream adoption. The first quarter following the introduction of these ETFs saw about $12.1 billion in total inflows, suggesting a strong demand for Bitcoin through this new investment avenue.\n\nThe presence of Bitcoin ETFs could potentially absorb some of the post-halving sell pressure typically expected from miners reducing their holdings due to lower block rewards. By offering a new route for capital inflow into the Bitcoin market, ETFs provide a buffer against the volatility usually associated with reduced miner income.\n\nAs the 2024 halving approaches, the interplay between reduced miner rewards and the influx of funds via ETFs could mirror yet another halving effect, softening potential price drops and supporting gradual price increases. This synergy between ETF adoption and evolving market structures lays a robust foundation for Bitcoin's sustained rise, potentially influencing the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market matures, the 2024 Bitcoin halving emerges as a pivotal event, augmented by the integration of ETFs into the market structure. For investors and market participants, understanding these shifts is crucial. Staying informed and adaptable will be key in navigating the intricacies of this halving event, enabling stakeholders to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate potential challenges. In this evolving narrative, Bitcoin not only retains its status as the leading cryptocurrency but also demonstrates its resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing financial landscape.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Dips Below the $3,200 Mark as Whales and Institutions Offload Holdings\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently experiencing significant selling pressure, exacerbated by large-scale dispositions from whales and key institutional players. As the broader cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, with over $900 million in liquidations recorded in the last 24 hours, Ethereum has not been spared, seeing its price struggle to maintain support levels.\n\nRecently, Ethereum's price momentarily dipped below the $3,200 mark to reach $3,161 before recovering slightly to hover around the $3,280 level, marking a 5.62% decrease within a single day. This volatility has been partly attributed to substantial sales by major Ethereum holders. According to data from Lookonchain, four significant entities offloaded a total of 31,683 ETH, worth approximately $106 million, contributing to the downward pressure on prices.\n\nThe transactions involved well-known entities in the crypto space:\n\n- Cumberland deposited 17,206 ETH onto exchanges, valued at around $57.3 million.\n\n- Wallet address 0xC3f8 moved 7,976 ETH to Binance, totaling about $26.6 million.\n\n- Wallet 0x1717 transferred 4,000 ETH, worth approximately $13.32 million, to various trading platforms.\n\n- Alameda/FTX was reported to have moved 2,500 ETH to Binance, which amounts to roughly $8.33 million.\n\nThese moves reflect a broader trend of large-scale Ethereum sales, which can significantly impact the market due to the substantial volumes involved.\n\nThe continuous flow of ETH to exchanges suggests that the selling pressure may not abate soon. Another report from Whale Alert highlighted an additional transfer of $158 million worth of Ethereum to Binance by an unknown wallet, indicating the potential for further sell-offs in the open market.\n\nAside from market actions, Ethereum is grappling with several ecosystem challenges that may be influencing investor sentiment negatively. Recent developments have cast doubt on the prospects for an Ethereum ETF, as regulatory and market hurdles continue to loom large. This uncertainty, combined with the active shedding of assets by major stakeholders like Alameda/FTX, suggests a tough road ahead for Ethereum.\n\nAs Ethereum navigates through these turbulent market conditions, the community and potential investors are closely monitoring these developments. The influx of large volumes of ETH onto exchanges and the accompanying sell-off activities by prominent institutional players are crucial factors that market participants will need to consider. These dynamics are pivotal in shaping Ethereum's short-term price movements and broader market standing amidst an already volatile financial landscape.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Priced at $0.00048 as Presale Exceeds $780,000\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is swiftly making its mark as a distinguished investment in the vibrant cryptocurrency market, drawing significant interest for its robust growth potential and appealing investor opportunities. Demonstrating outstanding success through its presale events, FURR has consistently attracted substantial investments. Presently in its sixth presale phase, the token has successfully raised over $780,000, illustrating its escalating popularity and the strong endorsement it enjoys from the cryptocurrency community.\n\nFURR positions itself as an exceptionally attractive investment by offering the potential for investors to achieve up to 15X returns from each presale stage.

        "title": "Which Crypto to Buy in 2024: Navigating Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Furrever Token (FURR) Market Trends - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the tumultuous sea of cryptocurrency trading, Ethereum (ETH) has recently demonstrated remarkable volatility, swiftly rebounding from a sharp drop to stabilize at a higher level, capturing the attention of both seasoned traders and crypto whales. This event underscores the persistent dynamism and significant capital movements within the crypto market. Concurrently, Dogecoin (DOGE) enjoys a hopeful rally, buoyed by broader market optimism and speculative interest ahead of the Bitcoin halving. Amidst these established giants, Furrever Token (FURR) continues to carve out its niche, showing impressive presale momentum and drawing substantial investments from a growing community of supporters. These developments highlight the ongoing activities and strategic plays in the cryptocurrency space, driven by key events and whale movements that often dictate market directions.\n\nWhales on the Move as Ethereum (ETH) Rebounds From $3,400\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently undergone a dramatic 24-hour period of trading that saw its price experiencing significant volatility. Initially, the cryptocurrency suffered a sharp 3.1% decline, dropping to $3,411, which led to the liquidation of tens of millions of dollars worth of positions within just an hour. However, not long after this steep drop, Ethereum saw a robust recovery, reaching a high of $3,615 before settling at $3,512 by the end of the day. Despite these substantial fluctuations, Ethereum's price remained essentially flat over the course of the 24-hour trading period.\n\nDuring this period of intense trading, the activities of major cryptocurrency investors, often referred to as 'crypto whales', were particularly noteworthy. According to a report from Spot On Chain, one such whale, known by the identifier \"0x347\", made a significant move by depositing 9,000 ETH into Binance. This deposit, valued at approximately $32 million, stands as the largest ETH deposit by this entity to date. After this transaction, \"0x347\" is now in possession of 29,738 ETH, which has an approximate market value of $106 million and has accrued an estimated profit of $68.5 million.\n\nIn addition, other reports by Lookonchain highlighted contrasting activities from another whale who took advantage of the market's dip to acquire 10,309 ETH, worth around $35.82 million. This purchase was part of a broader strategy that included a considerable investment just before a significant rise in Bitcoin's value on April 8.\n\nThe diverging actions of these major Ethereum holders reflect the mixed sentiments and strategies within the market regarding the short-term direction of Ethereum's price. While some see the recovery as a bullish sign indicating potential for further upward movement, others remain skeptical, viewing the rebound as merely a technical correction rather than the start of a sustained upward trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Ethereum constantly at the center of market speculation and analysis, the differing approaches of significant market players highlight the speculative and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to evolve, it remains a focal point for both opportunity and caution within the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Climbs 6% as Market Outlook Stays Hopeful\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), the leader among the world's meme cryptocurrencies, has experienced a surge, climbing 6% in the last 24 hours to reach $0.203. This increase comes amidst a broader wave of optimism in the cryptocurrency market, spurred by the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. However, the excitement was short-lived as Dogecoin's price dipped to $0.192, culminating in a weekly gain of 3.2% and a monthly rise of 9.85%. Despite these fluctuations, Dogecoin maintains its status as the largest meme coin by market capitalization.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of Dogecoin's current market position is that it trades at a considerable discount, 73% below its all-time high of $0.7316. This significant gap suggests potential undervaluation, fueling speculations that Dogecoin might be poised for substantial gains in the near future, especially as the Bitcoin halving approaches.\n\nMarket analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin's trajectory, predicting potential price increases leading up to the halving event slated for April 20th. This event is anticipated not only to impact Bitcoin but to have a ripple effect across various digital currencies, potentially ushering in another bull market.\n\nThe technical indicators on Dogecoin\u2019s price chart reinforce this optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), after peaking at 70, has seen a slight retreat, expected to stabilize around 60 or 55, suggesting that any declines might be short-lived and followed by further gains.\n\nAdditionally, trading volumes for Dogecoin have shown remarkable growth, with a 13% increase from the previous day, reaching around $2.52 billion. This heightened activity is indicative of growing investor interest, further evidenced by substantial purchases by whales on various trading platforms in recent days.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a strong likelihood that Dogecoin will experience significant price movements one or two more times before the Bitcoin halving event. This period could be critical for investors looking to capitalize on the anticipated market dynamics. As always, while the potential for high returns exists, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments calls for caution and thorough analysis before making any financial commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Priced at $0.00048 as Near %200 Return Still Possible\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is rapidly gaining traction as a standout investment in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, capturing widespread interest due to its impressive growth potential and lucrative opportunities for investors.

        "content": "Ethereum risk reversal sunk by 20% on Tuesday following nervousness surrounding the recent crypto market crash.\n\nETH liquidated long positions reached $67.37 million in the past 24 hours as short traders prevailed.\n\nGlassnode shared insights into the recent Ethereum issuance reduction proposal that has sparked criticism from the crypto community.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price briefly dipped below $3,000 on Tuesday after tensions surrounding a potential Iran-Israel conflict suppressed the effect of Hong Kong's spot ETH approval. Regardless of the price dump, the recent ETH issuance reduction proposal has made the rounds again following research firm Glassnode's report.\n\nRead more: Ethereum recovers from dip as Hong Kong ETH ETF approval sparks whale buying spree\n\nDaily digest market movers: risk reversal dips, liquidated long positions, ETH issuance\n\nEthereum headlines the crypto market again with increased attention surrounding it. Here are your key market movers:\n\nEthereum investors are showing increased nervousness as ETH risk reversals have sunk 20% on Tuesday, according to QCP Broadcast. Generally, crypto bulls are exercising caution as Bitcoin and other altcoins have also posted losses following the prevalence of the Iran-Israel conflict. QCP further highlights that the market is shorting ETH gamma, indicating a sharp move either upward or downward could be amplified.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong spot ETH ETF approval, the second largest digital asset saw increasing discussions, making it the most trending token among traders, according to data from Santiment. Despite the increased attention, ETH shorts have risen by 54% as bearish sentiment around the digital asset continues increasing.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market liquidation heat map validates this as Ethereum has seen over $81.9 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, according to data from Santiment. Liquidated long positions account for $67.4 million of the total ETH liquidations, with the largest coming from an ETH-USD swap valued at $6 million.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price stagnates as EIP-3074 brings smart contract functionalities to wallets\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's proposal to reduce ETH issuance still faces criticism despite clarifications that the aim is to maintain Ethereum's status as money and a balance in the network's governance power, according to Glassnode.\n\n\n\nThe rise of restaking and liquid restaking tokens increases ETH's inflation rate and impacts several ETH holders. \"In other words, there is a wealth transfer taking place from a shrinking pool of non-staked ETH holders, towards a growing pool of staked ETH holders,\" says Glassnode.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the \"real yield\" could shift the \"role of money\" within the Ethereum ecosystem from ETH to liquid staking tokens or restaking tokens because of their significantly high yields. \"A side-effect of such a development would be the projects which issue these derivative tokens gaining an outsized influence over the governance and stability of Ethereum's execution and consensus layers,\" stated Glassnode.\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH to trade below $3,301\n\nEthereum bears prevailed in the past 24 hours as its price has found it difficult to recover from the weekend slump. After a brief move toward $3,300 on Monday, expectations were that it would maintain a sideways movement in the $3,210 to $3,406 range. However, ETH declined further, settling around the $3,000 support.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nRead more: Ethereum price recovers slightly as whales begin accumulation spree\n\nConsidering current volatility, ETH may trade inside the range of $2,852 and $3,301, both formed on Saturday. A move above the range may see it breaking past the $3,406 resistance of April 7 and testing the 3,618 key level of April 11. A further upward move will see ETH sustain bullish momentum. However, a move below the range will see ETH entering a bearish trend.\n\nThree factors will affect this thesis: the upcoming Bitcoin halving, a potential Iran-Israeli conflict, and the Securities & Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision on a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nEthereum is trading around the $3,000 support at the time of writing."

Unveiled by Polygon in January, the solution looks to make many different blockchains feel as if they are one through a shared network state and liquidity that lets funds seamlessly flow from one network to the next.\n\n\u201cWe are building an ecosystem that is as seamless and interoperable as possible,\u201d OKX\u2019s Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in a statement, adding that \u201cX Layer has limitless potential thanks to [OKX\u2019s] strong community.\u201d\n\nThe Singapore-based exchange, which has over 50 million users globally, is one of crypto\u2019s largest by trading volume.

Since launching last July, Base has attracted around 8 million users while processing 154 million total transactions, according to data from Dune Analytics.\n\nIn addition to cheap transactions, layer-2 networks make interacting with decentralized applications (dapps) more feasible for users because they cost less to use. Through X Layer, users have access to 170 dapps, which is \u201cslated to increase exponentially,\u201d OKX said in a statement.\n\nAs of now, notable dapps released on X Layer include the decentralized exchange QuickSwap, community-building platform Galxe, and the infrastructure platform Thirdweb.\n\nOne noticeable difference between Base and Layer X is the latter network\u2019s embrace of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHong Kong\u2019s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could begin trading by the end of the month, the veteran analyst behind 10x Research told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhile no trading date has been set, expectations are for April 30,\u201d said 10x Research founder Markus Thielen. He also writes research reports for Singapore-based trading platform Matrixport and was previously its Head of Research and Strategy.\n\nThielen's comments come the day after Hong Kong gave conditional approval for a number of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications managed by China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera, and HashKey, respectively.\n\nAs a result of the U.S. approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, there was a substantial increase in demand for crypto asset exposure, which has helped push along the most recent bull run. But according to Thielen, the level of success of Hong Kong ETFs heavily depends on whether Chinese mainland investors can purchase them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange\u2019s southbound stock connect allows qualified mainland China investors to access eligible Hong Kong financial assets. The southbound connect has a daily quota of \u00a542 billion\u2014and if exceeded, trades will be rejected. But in recent years, this quota hasn\u2019t been reached.\n\n\u201cThis program allows mainland investors to buy up to \u00a5500 billion ($69 billion USD) of Hong Kong-listed stocks annually\u2014or equivalent to HK$540 billion annually,\u201d Thielen told Decrypt. \u201cDuring the last three years, the annual spare quota was HK$100 billion to HK$200 billion ($15 billion to $25 billion).\"\n\n\"If Chinese investors could buy,\" he added, \"this is how much mainland investors could allocate\u2014as an upper limit.\"\n\nHowever, this future seems unlikely for now, as Thielen believes that the ETFs will not become part of the southbound program for at least six months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMost market participants expect Chinese mainland investors to be unable to buy these products and that they will not be added to the southbound connect program,\u201d Thielen explained. \u201cCurrently, Hong Kong ETFs need to have been listed for six months, but regulation could always change.\u201d\n\nThat said, Thielen suggested that due to \u201cChina\u2019s property worries\u201d and decade-long weakness in the stock market, the country could look to Bitcoin to diversify its assets.\n\n\u201cAlthough some forms of Bitcoin activities are banned in China, the ban might be primarily motivated by the fear of social unrest due to scams, illegal capital raising, etc,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cA regulated product like the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is more favorable.\u201d\n\nDespite China\u2019s ban of crypto trading and mining in 2021, the country has remained at the forefront of crypto conversations. In 2023, top crypto exchange Binance processed $90 billion of Chinese transactions in a single month\u2014accounting for 20% of Binance\u2019s worldwide volume at the time.\n\nSince then, Hong Kong has positioned itself as the next crypto hub\u2014opening trading to retail investors and now approving crypto spot ETFs\u2014which experts told Decrypt could be China using the territory as a \u201ctesting ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing happens in Hong Kong without China's blessing\u2014not even a raindrop,\u201d Thielen added. \u201cSo when the two leading financial market authorities (HKMA and SFC) approve Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, there must be a conscious decision and a calculation around the impact this might have.\u201d\n\nHowever, Thielen suggested that this might not be as bullish as many crypto enthusiasts first thought, due to cultural differences in investing.\n\n\u201cETFs have limited success in Asia as investors like to take direct/concentrated bets, instead of buying a basket of something,\u201d he said. However, in this case, as the ETFs represent a single asset rather than 10 to over 100 stocks, it\u2019s much closer to being a direct bet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTherefore, the success rate could be much larger than that of other basket-time ETFs,\u201d he added.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "Ethereum Price : Will ETH Price Recover In 2024 ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum has been facing challenges in holding onto its top spot in the market among altcoins. The bears causing the global cryptocurrency market decline are also dominating ETH. After dropping more than 11% in the last month, it appears the coin is loosing ground to Bitcoin. With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon for April 20, 2024, the crypto community is eagerly anticipating whether the price of Ethereum will see a rebound. Let\u2019s explore thoroughly to discover the potential.\n\nMarket Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ethereum experienced a 5.19% drop in its price, falling to $3,086.39. The significant drop in its market performance has also been highlighted by the significant decrease of ETH, by 14.27% and 11.36% in the last week and month respectively.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum holds the title of the second largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $371.15 billion. Moreover, the coin experienced a drop of around 5.86% in its trading volume, reaching $21.77 billion, in the last 24 hours. This decrease shows lower liquidity and trader interest in the coin.\n\nETH price reached its highest point at $4,891.70 on November 16, 2021. After that, Ethereum has experienced a decrease of around 36.67% reaching the current price.\n\nFactors Determining the Recovery of Ethereum Price\n\nVarious factors play a role in the recovery of ETH price as discussed below.\n\n1. Bitcoin Halving\n\nBitcoin Halving might also impact the rise in ETH trading price. The event that takes place after every four years, has a notable effect on the cryptocurrency market. It could impact the Ethereum (ETH) price in different ways. Initially, the halving decreases the amount of new coins being introduced into circulation. This limited availability may result in higher demand as investors look to spread out their investments. If the price of Bitcoin increases after the halving, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are expected to also see price hikes because of the increased interest in the market.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin halvings result in excitement and speculation within the investment community. This feeling can also affect other cryptocurrencies. Anticipating positive impacts from Bitcoin halving, individuals might choose to invest in other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, leading to an increase in their value.\n\n2. Ethereum ETFs\n\nIncreased attention from institutional investors and major companies in Ethereum may bring stability and boost the price. The potential launch of new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May, 2024 could lead to a surge in Ethereum\u2019s value, similar to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs. However, analysts are concerned about the SEC approval process, with the likelihood decreasing from 70% to 30% due to a lack of communication from regulators. Investors should be cautious about expectations surrounding the approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\n3. General Cryptocurrency Market Recovery\n\nA recovery in the cryptocurrency market can result in Ethereum\u2019s price bounce due to various factors. Firstly, as investor confidence grows with the market\u2019s rebound, more individuals are likely to invest in Ethereum. Secondly, renewed capital inflows into cryptocurrencies typically include Ethereum due to its reputation and use cases. Additionally, Ethereum often follows Bitcoin\u2019s trends, so when Bitcoin\u2019s price rises during a market recovery, Ethereum\u2019s price also tends to increase. Moreover, market liquidity and trading volume can rise during a recovery, leading to smoother price movements and potential upward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price. Furthermore, increased interest in blockchain technology and decentralized applications can drive further demand for Ethereum. Institutional investors may also be attracted to Ethereum during a recovery, contributing to its price growth.\n\n4. ETH\u2019s Price Forecast\n\nBoth the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) show that short-term periods of 10, 20, and 30 days are signaling a bearish trend based on technical indicators. The Ethereum price is below thes moving averages, showing the possibility of a price drop in the short-term.\n\nSimilarly the EMA and SMA for extended durations like 50, 100, and 200 days are also indicating a downward trend. indicating a bearish direction. The current price of ETH is below these moving averages, showing that the overall price movement of Ethereum remains bearish.\n\nThe MACD with 12 and 26 periods is giving a Buy signal, suggesting a possible short-term turnaround.\n\nThe MACD, which is a momentum indicator, calculates the variance between two moving averages, and the Buy signal could indicate a slight move towards an upward trend for ETH.\n\nHowever, there is a Sell signal shown by the EMA across different time periods, ranging from 10 days to 200 days. This indicates that Ethereum\u2019s price might keep experiencing downward pressure in the near to medium future. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 37.6 is in the neutral range. It indicates that ETH\u2019s price is neither overbought or oversold, suggesting there may be potential for a price reversal if the RSI moves further towards either extreme.\n\nOn the downside, should the price of ETH, it will find support at $2698.5. Should the decline further past the level, it will find another key level at $2698.5. Any more losses might see the price drop further to $2361.2\n\nIf the bulls fail to protect the $2698.5 support, the price might decline toward $2361.2.\n\nOn the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $3581.4 level and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the 3789.7 level. A clear move above this level of resistance could send the price toward $4127.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite facing hurdles and declines, Ethereum price shows indications of potential recovery and opportunities for a comeback. The future Bitcoin halving and possible introduction of Ethereum ETFs may have a positive effect on the price of Ethereum. Moreover, the collective rebound of the crypto market could help reverse the direction of Ethereum\u2019s price movement. Investors need to monitor important support and resistance levels, alongside changes in technical indicators like RSI, EMA, and MACD, to detect any shifts in momentum. Ultimately, Ethereum\u2019s future success will be influenced by various factors, making it crucial for investors to remain informed and prudent."

The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with speculation about the potential impact on various digital assets following the event.\n\nAmong the coins garnering significant attention is Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Many enthusiasts and investors are now pondering whether ETH has the potential to reach its all-time high of $4,891.70 in the aftermath of the halving.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, which takes place approximately every four years, has historically been a catalyst for substantial growth across the cryptocurrency market. This event reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by 50%, thereby reducing the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation.\n\nA surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price often results from this reduction in supply and steady or increasing demand. This has positively influenced the broader crypto market, including altcoins like Ethereum.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction This Week\n\nChangelly Analysis Predicts Significant ETH Price Increase\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by Changelly, a prominent cryptocurrency data provider, Ethereum could hit $3,171.61 on April 21, 2024, just one day after the Bitcoin halving.\n\nFurthermore, Changelly\u2019s long-term forecast for Ethereum is even more promising. The analysis indicates that by June 2025, ETH could potentially reach $4,964.07, surpassing its previous all-time high and setting a new record for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn addition, Changelly has also provided their insights on Ethereum\u2019s potential price trajectory for April 2024.\n\nAlso read; Cryptocurrency: Whales Scooped Up These Coins Amidst Market Dip\n\nBased on the price fluctuations observed at the beginning of 2023, these experts expect the average ETH rate to be $3,139.16 in April 2024.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Weighs-In On Default Transaction Privacy on Ethereum - CoinGape",
        "content": "Conversations regarding privacy on the Ethereum blockchain have taken a new twist in the crypto community. At its core, the discussion centers on whether Ethereum, as a foundational layer of blockchain technology, should inherently provide transaction privacy. Recently, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, offered his insights into this contentious issue.\n\nThe question raised is pivotal \u201cShould a base layer like Ethereum offer transaction privacy as a default feature?\u201d This query encapsulates broader concerns about the balance between privacy, transparency, and stability within blockchain networks. By delving into Buterin\u2019s perspective, we can gain valuable insights into the complexities of this debate.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Opinion\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s perspective on default transaction privacy aligns with the analogy of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). He draws a parallel between Ethereum\u2019s protocol and the operation of TCP, which functions in a clear text manner, leaving encryption tasks to higher layers. Buterin argues that Ethereum could adopt a similar approach, delegating encryption responsibilities to upper layers while maintaining a stable base layer.\n\nThis viewpoint highlights the importance of adaptability and resilience in the face of evolving encryption protocols. By separating encryption concerns from the base layer, Ethereum can ensure stability while accommodating advancements in privacy technology. Buterin\u2019s stance underscores the pragmatic approach needed to navigate the complex interplay between privacy, security, and technological progress in blockchain networks.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Co-founder Predicts Market Comeback, Cites $9 Trillion Cash Pool\n\nImplications and Discussion\n\nButerin\u2019s perspective carries significant implications for Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem. The adoption of default transaction privacy at the base layer could enhance user privacy and security, addressing concerns about data surveillance and identity theft. However, it also raises challenges related to regulatory compliance, as opaque transactions may hinder efforts to combat illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nFurthermore, the implementation of default transaction privacy may impact network scalability and efficiency, as cryptographic operations can impose computational overhead. This trade-off between privacy and performance underscores the need for careful consideration and strategic decision-making in blockchain protocol design.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu Community Burns 774M SHIB Despite Market Crash, What\u2019s Next?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Bitcoin price could dip below $60,000 before BTC halving date amid elevated market risk.\n\nEthereum price brews bullish reversal toward $4,000 contingent on how BTC bulls play their hand.\n\nRipple price could revisit weekend lows below $0.4500 amid mounting overhead pressure.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has the broader cryptocurrency market on standby, awaiting a definitive directional bias. Like in the case for most altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are in the red on the back of chaos in the Middle East between Iran and Israel.\n\nGeopolitical tensions between the two countries have markets in risk-off mode. For instance, Bitcoin price dipped to $62,000 on Saturday when reports confirmed that Iran had launched dozens of drones at Israel. However, following reports by Iran\u2019s United Nations (UN) Mission that the country\u2019s retaliatory attack on Israel was \u201cdeemed complete,\u201d Bitcoin price bounced above $65,000 on Sunday.\n\nI know a guy who sold all his Bitcoin at $61,666 because Iran was apparently \u201cvery serious\u201d about destroying Israel this time and that global nuclear warfare was \u201cinevitable\u201d. Now he\u2019s in a state of panic as BTC has bounced back to $65,000 and he doesn\u2019t know what to do. Scary. \u2014 Mike Alfred (@mikealfred) April 13, 2024\n\nAs indicated in a previous report, the crypto markets are dumping because of a general atmosphere of fear and risk aversion in financial markets. Investors are looking to liquidate their positions to reduce risk and move toward more traditional safe-haven assets like Gold and Silver.\n\nNevertheless, the market has the BTC halving in sight, out barely five days with just about 642 blocks remaining.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price tanks to $62K ascribed to geopolitical tension a week to BTC halving\n\nBitcoin price could revisit $60,000\n\nBitcoin price downside momentum could have more play before the halving. The pioneer crypto remains below crucial support provided by the ascending trendline after a slip below three days ago. Stuck in the lower section of the market range between $61,970 and $73,122, where selling pressure climaxed and buying pressure peaked, respectively, the odds favor the bears.\n\nFor starters, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the \u201850\u2019 mean level with an overall southbound inclination. This, coupled with the position of both the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in negative territory reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nWhile a retest of the $61,970 base is likely, the dire case could see Bitcoin price go as low as the $60,000 psychological level before a pullback.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a show of strength by BTC bulls could see Bitcoin price reclaim above the bullish trendline, confirmed by a flip of the 50% Fibonacci placeholder into support above $67,546. This could draw more bulls to the scene, sending BTC price above the $69,000 threshold. In a highly bullish case, BTC could reclaim the $73,777 all-time high before an attempt at further upside.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price unable to tag $67K despite Hong Kong BTC and ETH spot ETF approvals\n\nEthereum price works out a bullish reversal, but BTC won\u2019t let it happen\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge, which is a bullish reversal pattern. Contingent on whether BTC shows strength or crashes further, ETH price could respond in kind. A show of strength could send Ethereum price higher. A breach of the upper boundary of the governing chart pattern above the $3,750 level would signal the opening of a long position.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with the broader market still in the red, Ethereum price could continue the fall below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $3,023. A candlestick close below $2,750 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum whales pushes its price up as Hong Kong approves spot ETH ETF\n\nRipple price next move hinges on RSI bounce\n\nRipple price could have more downside momentum to come amid growing overhead pressure due to the 50, 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) at $0.6094, $0.5754, and $0.5837, respectively.\n\nWith the RSI well below 50 and the MACD and AO in negative territory, XRP price could slide to $0.4500. Even worse, it could establish a lower low below the April 13 bottom, tagging the $0.4000 psychological level.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, traders buying the correction could bode well for Ripple price. While a move above the $0.6000 psychological level would be ideal, the bearish thesis would only be invalidated upon a candlestick close above $0.6685. Traders should watch for the RSI bouncing above the 30 threshold for possible entry.\n\nAlso Read: XRP recovers from weekend massive decline after developers propose native lending on XRP Ledger"

        "content": "Amid a widespread selloff in the cryptocurrency market, the Ethereum price trajectory has attracted significant attention from traders and analysts alike. Meanwhile, the recent decline in the Bitcoin price has further contributed to the decline in the broader crypto market.\n\nNotably, as discussions intensify regarding the potential for further declines, key support levels for Ethereum emerge as crucial indicators for market sentiment and future price movements.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts Unveils Crucial Support Zone For Ethereum\n\nAs Ethereum faces downward pressure amid the ongoing market turmoil, attention turns to critical support levels that could influence its trajectory. Notably, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a key support zone for Ethereum, ranging from $2,000 to $2,430.\n\nMartinez said that within this range, approximately 9.37 million addresses collectively hold nearly 53 million ETH, underscoring its significance as a potential turning point for Ethereum\u2019s price direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Ali Martinez\u2019s analysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics shaping Ethereum\u2019s current price momentum. Highlighting the importance of the critical support zone, Martinez\u2019s insights serve as a focal point for cryptocurrency market participants evaluating Ethereum\u2019s resilience amid market volatility.\n\nWith speculation rife over the possibility of further selloffs, Martinez\u2019s observations prompt a reevaluation of Ethereum\u2019s market fundamentals and potential recovery paths.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Selloff To Continue During Bitcoin Halving Event\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nDespite the prevailing market downturn, optimism persists within the crypto community, fueled in part by recent regulatory approvals. Notably, Hong Kong\u2019s green light for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has injected a sense of confidence, echoing the positive sentiment following the U.S. Spot Bitcoin approval. Besides, the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event adds another layer of intrigue, as historical data suggests a potential uptick in market momentum post-Halving.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that while historical trends offer insights into potential market movements, they do not guarantee future outcomes. Concerns over short-term volatility, particularly in the lead-up to the Bitcoin Halving, raise questions about Ethereum\u2019s immediate price trajectory. As investors weigh the implications of market dynamics and regulatory developments, Ali Martinez\u2019s analysis serves as a guidepost for navigating the uncertain terrain of the crypto market.\n\nAs Ethereum grapples with the fallout from the broader market selloff, attention shifts to critical support levels and expert analyses for guidance. While challenges persist, the crypto community remains cautiously optimistic, drawing on past precedents and regulatory developments to chart a course forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum price was down 7.48% and traded at $3,013.42 during writing, while its one-day trading volume stayed near the flatline at $22.42 billion. Amid the recent price dip, the ETH price has lost nearly 16% over the last seven days.

        "content": "ETH\u2019s fall has caused holders to rethink their belief in the coin\u2019s potential.\n\nThe MVRV ratio showed that altcoin was undervalued.\n\nLong-term holders of Ethereum [ETH] have signaled that they are also concerned about the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential, AMBCrypto discovered.\n\nWe found out after examining the Long-Term Holders Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (LTH-NUPL). The metric considers the behavior of investors with a UTXO of at least 155 days.\n\nHolders are not calm\n\nIf the metric displays red, then investors are scared that the cryptocurrency might capitulate. Color blue suggests euphoria or greed.\n\nAt press time, the LTH-NUPL had moved from green to yellow. Green signifies the viewpoint that the price might continue to appreciate. But with Ethereum at yellow, it means that holders of the altcoins are now anxious and unsure about its potential.\n\nThe change in sentiment could be linked to ETH\u2019s price action. On the 12th of April, the cryptocurrency crashed below $3,200. When market participants thought that the collapse was over, another one occurred.\n\nThis time, it was the unsettling state in the Middle East that sent ETH to $2,850. However, press time data showed that the price has reclaimed $3,000 again.\n\nBut will the price be higher than this in the short term? AMBCrypto evaluated the possibility by assessing the Seller Exhaustion Constant.\n\nSelling pressure may take ETH to another level\n\nAn increase in the Seller Exhaustion Constant indicated that sellers are running out of steam. If this was the case, the price of ETH might be gearing up for a significant upside.\n\nHowever, data from Glassnode showed that the metric dropped to 0.036, meaning that bears were not out of the way yet. Should the reading continue to go lower, ETH\u2019s price might also fall.\n\nIn this instance, Ethereum holders might move from being optimistic to displaying their fears. The price of the cryptocurrency could also be affected, and another decline toward $2,800 could be next.\n\nConversely, a spike in the metric could change the state of things for the better. If this happens, ETH could try revisiting $3,200 to $3,500 within a short period.\n\nFurthermore, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio suggested a possible bounce for ETH. At press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was -11.22%.\n\nThis reading was proof that most ETH holders who accumulated recently were at a loss. However, the MVRV ratio also shows if an asset is undervalued, at fair value, or overvalued.\n\nSince the metric was negative, it suggested that Ethereum was in an undervalued state. Take for instance\u2014 the 20th of March when the metric was around the same spot, and the price was $3,100.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nDays later, the value of the cryptocurrency rallied to $3,669. There were other instances where a similar thing happened.\n\nTherefore, the long-term potential of ETH might remain bullish and holders might eventually put two feet forward."

        "content": "Hong Kong regulators recently approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund applications, but Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts that the local ETF market may not perform as well as the US due to the current lack of big players and the possibility of high fees.\n\nAccording to Balchunas, the Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether ETF market may generate $500 million in inflows, which is small compared to the over $15 billion from BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF product alone in the United States.\n\nHong Kong Spot BTC ETF Smaller than the US\n\nThe Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on April 15 granted in-principle approval for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products from China Asset Management, Harvest Global Investments, and Bosera Asset Management in partnership with HashKey Capital.\n\nWhile the spot crypto approvals are a major milestone for Hong Kong, which is determined to position itself as a central digital assets hub, there are speculations that the city-state may not witness large inflows like in the United States.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, in a tweet, predicted that the Hong Kong ETF market could see an inflow of $500 million, debating another prediction that estimated $25 billion.\n\nAccording to Balchunas, key factors such as the absence of major players in the Hong Kong ETF market and the possibility of these issuers charging high fees could hinder demand for the products.\n\nThe ETF analysts added that the potential local issuers are small compared to the behemoths in the United States. The US boasts financial giants such as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and Fidelity, which has nearly $5 trillion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nIn terms of fees, one to two percent, as speculated by Balchunas, may prove uncompetitive for Hong Kong Bitcoin ETF issuers, with US ETF providers offering 0.25% and lower.\n\nAs previously reported by CryptoPotato, Grayscale, which currently charges 1.5% for a management fee on its spot Bitcoin ETF, said there would be a reduction over time, following the maturity of the ETF market.\n\nThe company\u2019s management fee is significantly higher than its rivals and has seen continuous outflows compared to competitors such as BlackRock, which continues to record gains.\n\nWhen Spot Ethereum ETF in the United States?\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETF market could see an uptick if bigger players are involved and mainland Chinese investors are allowed access to the product, according to Balchunas.\n\nAlthough the US spot Bitcoin ETF market is larger than Hong Kong\u2019s, the latter may have an edge over the United States, being one of the first jurisdictions with an approved spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nSince greenlighting almost a dozen applications in January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be reluctant to give its approval for a similar product tracking the price of Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, Frank Templeton, Fidelity, and Invesco are among the applicants for a spot Ether ETF. The American regulator recently delayed its decision on Ethereum filings from BlackRock and Fidelity after previous delays on other applications.\n\nHowever, some analysts believe the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States may not happen in 2024."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP witnessed its most brutal price drop in years, plummeting by 20% in two days. Typically, XRP is characterized by low volatility, the magnitude of this plunge was particularly catastrophic.\n\nThis sharp decline pushed XRP's value down, breaching several crucial support levels. The fall was abrupt, slicing through the anticipated support near the $0.58 mark with ease, and coming to rest just above the $0.48 level.\n\nOur main focus now turns to the asset's next technical support levels. The 200-day EMA stands out as a potential bounce point, roughly at the $0.57 mark, slightly above where the plunge halted. Should XRP stabilize and recover above this line, it could instill a semblance of confidence back into the market.\n\nDespite the shock, growth scenarios remain on the horizon. For a bullish reversal to gain credibility, XRP would need to reclaim its position above the resistance formed near the $0.58 level. But considering the current state of the market, that goal seems surreal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum on verge\n\nEthereum is teetering on the edge, with its price just above $3,050 after a significant drop. This precarious position has the crypto community asking: Is Ethereum about to dip below the symbolic $3,000 mark?\n\nThe recent price trajectory has not been kind to Ethereum, as the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently near the $3,050 level, is being tested. This average has often provided some buoyancy, but its strength as a support level is not ironclad. Should Ethereum fail to maintain this level, a drop below $3,000 seems increasingly plausible.\n\nHowever, it is worth considering the potential for a reversal. The start of a new week could see market dynamics shift as investors look to capitalize on what they perceive as bargain prices. This buying pressure at local lows has the potential to reverse the downtrend, at least temporarily.\n\nFrom a chart perspective, if Ethereum holds its ground above the $3,050 support, there is room for cautious optimism. A rebound from this level could push prices back toward the resistance at $3,400. This would indicate a resurgence of buying interest and could help avert a more substantial decline.\n\nIf Ethereum breaks below the $3,000 threshold, the next significant level of support rests at the 200-day EMA, which is around $2,695. A slip to this lower boundary could mark a more pronounced bearish phase for Ethereum.\n\nLooking ahead, the key for Ethereum is whether it can summon the strength to defend the $3,000 level. If it does, and particularly if it can then surge past the 100 EMA, the narrative might shift back to a positive one.\n\nBitcoin fails\n\nBitcoin has surprised us all with the substantial price drop that now makes the majority of market participants worry about the future of this bullish cycle.\n\nThe drop to levels around $64,300 may signal a trend reversal, marking the end of the recent bull run.\n\nDespite the recent dip, Bitcoin has not completely left its support levels. The 50-day moving average currently sits near $58,417, offering a glimmer of hope as a potential bounce-back point. If Bitcoin can stabilize and hold above this MA, a reversal remains a possibility.\n\nA deeper look at the chart suggests that the $64,300 drop could open up a scenario where Bitcoin tests the next support level, which is the 100-day MA near $60,000. Holding above this could be crucial for maintaining a bullish outlook. If it does, and investor confidence remains steady, there is a chance for Bitcoin to recover and aim for resistance levels once again, possibly around $67,500, where it recently faced pushback."

        "content": "Hong Kong has given the green light to various spot ETFs on Bitcoin and spot ETFs on Ethereum, managed by China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera, and HashKey. The asset managers, at the moment, have not disclosed the launch schedule.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nHong Kong opens the doors to crypto investment with spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nLast week Hong Kong gave the green light to the requests for several spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the region continues its race to become a regional hub for cryptocurrencies.\n\nChina Asset Management, one of the leading Chinese asset managers, has announced that its Hong Kong subsidiary has obtained preliminary acceptance from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nThis is in order to offer retail asset management services related to crypto spot ETFs. The company plans to launch spot ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum in collaboration with OSL and BOCI International.\n\nOSL has confirmed to act as the \u201cfirst virtual asset trading partner and sub-custodian\u201d of China Asset Management for the upcoming ETFs.\n\nEven the two spot crypto ETFs from Harvest Global Investments have received preliminary acceptance from the SFC, as stated by the company itself.\n\nIt is expected that these ETFs will be issued in collaboration with OSL, in order to effectively mitigate issues related to excessively high margin requirements.\n\nOSL has guaranteed that it will provide a safe trading environment, managing the underlying assets with precision and reliability.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s pro-crypto stance\n\nEven Bosera Asset Management, a subsidiary of Hong Kong of a major Chinese asset manager, and HashKey Capital have confirmed that they have received conditional approval for two crypto spot ETFs that they will manage together.\n\nHowever, it was not immediately clear what this \u201cconditional approval\u201d entails.\n\nThe two have declared their intention to launch a spot ETF on Bitcoin, called Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF, and a spot ETF on Ethereum, called Bosera HashKey Ether ETF.\n\nBoth funds will allow investors to subscribe to ETF shares using Bitcoin and Ethereum directly. At the moment, a precise launch date has not been communicated.\n\nBosera commented that the introduction of Virtual Asset Spot ETFs not only provides new opportunities for asset allocation to investors, but also strengthens Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial center and hub for virtual assets.\n\nUnlike mainland China, which has imposed restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and mining, Hong Kong welcomed cryptocurrency companies last year.\n\nIn June 2023, Hong Kong officially launched its licensing regime for cryptocurrency trading platforms, allowing two authorized platforms, HashKey and OSL, to offer retail trading services.\n\nETF on Ethereum: United States beaten\n\nAdrian Wang, CEO of Metalpha, a digital asset company based in Asia, shared with The Block that Ethereum spot ETFs could soon become a benchmark in the industry.\n\nSpecifically, he stated the following:\n\n\u201cI believe that the Ethereum ETF could have a more significant impact than the Bitcoin ETF. Investors currently have several options to gain exposure to Bitcoin through mining-related stocks, but there are no stocks related to Ethereum yet.\u201d\n\nAngela Ang, former regulator at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and senior policy advisor at TRM Labs, highlighted that the approval of Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong precedes that of the United States.\n\nTherefore, representing an important milestone in Hong Kong\u2019s journey to become a leading center in the cryptocurrency sector.

Harvest Global was one of the just three ETF providers to receive conditional approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) this week to launch spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\n\nMr. Thomas Tam, Chief Executive Officer of SOLOWIN, commented, \"We are excited to play a crucial role in the launch of Harvest Global\u2019s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in Hong Kong.

        "content": "GM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nThe restaking rush continues with EigenLayer and Karak launches.\n\nUpgradable code costs Blast DeFi users $26 million.\n\n\u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d says Vitalik Buterin after using Tornado Cash alternative Railgun.\n\nKarak challenges EigenLayer in restaking race\n\nEigenLayer just hit a new milestone on its restaking road map, letting those who have deposited tokens to the protocol delegate them to node operators.\n\nNode operators are individuals or organizations that let users delegate their restaked Ether to them. They then opt in to provide actively validated services, which earn delegates a boosted yield on their restaked Ether.\n\nDelegated tokens will secure EigenDA, the first of many protocols expected to benefit from restaking on Ethereum. However, restakers will have to wait a few more weeks to start earning boosted yields.\n\nAnd EigenLayer isn\u2019t the only one. Karak, EigenLayer\u2019s main competitor, has launched private access, letting those with an invite start to restake on the protocol.\n\nSo far, Karak has drawn in $195 million in deposits \u2014 still far below EigenLayer\u2019s $12.6 billion.\n\nLike EigenLayer, Karak has launched its own points system, called Karak XP.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPoints systems usually indicate a DeFi protocol is planning to launch and airdrop a token.\n\nWith two restaking protocols offering potential airdrops, whichever one announces a token first should receive a big boost from the attention.\n\nPac Finance users lose $26 million in seconds\n\nA sudden, unexpected code change at Blast lending protocol Pac Finance cost users $26 million, highlighting the risks of upgradable smart contract code.\n\n\u201cThis was a result of the liquidation threshold being altered unexpectedly without prior notification to our team,\u201d Pac Finance said on X.\n\nPac Finance is a fork of Aave, the biggest lending protocol in DeFi.\n\nA fork is where a developer team uses the open-source code from an existing DeFi protocol to launch a similar protocol \u2014 often on a different blockchain or with minor changes.\n\n\u201cFundamental problem with forking code is the lack of in-depth knowledge of the software and the parameters,\u201d Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Avara, the company behind the Aave protocol, said in an X post.\n\nThe incident highlights the risk of upgradable code in DeFi protocols. If a protocol chooses to keep its code upgradable, those with permission can change the rules that govern the protocol at any time \u2014 often without warning.\n\nNot all DeFi protocols allow for code upgrades. Uniswap, Curve Finance, and many other protocols make their code immutable, meaning once it\u2019s deployed on a blockchain, it cannot be retroactively changed.\n\nVitalik on privacy protocol Railgun\n\n\u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in an X post on Monday, responding to the fact that he had just transferred 100 ETH \u2014 worth about $310,000 \u2014 through privacy protocol Railgun.\n\nPrivacy is normal.\n\n\n\nRailgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( https://t.co/DekkatsMR5 ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.https://t.co/MG0huDzpAu \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 15, 2024\n\nPrivacy is normal.\n\n\n\nRailgun uses the privacy pools protocol ( https://t.co/DekkatsMR5 ) which makes it much harder for bad actors to join the pool without compromising users' privacy.https://t.co/MG0huDzpAu \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 15, 2024\n\nRailgun is similar to sanctioned protocol Tornado Cash in that both allow users to break the chain of traceability between blockchain transactions.\n\nHowever, Railgun uses the Privacy Pool protocol, an idea put forward in an academic paper co-authored by Buterin in September.\n\nPrivacy Pools tries to solve the issues with Tornado Cash \u2014 namely that it has facilitated an estimated $1.2 billion worth of illicit transactions for criminal organisations such as North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group.\n\nIt lets honest users create a cryptographic proof that shows the money they put into the protocol didn\u2019t come from wallets associated with stolen funds or illicit activity, while at the same time keeping the origin of the money secret.\n\nThe hope is that if all honest users generate these proofs, bad actors attempting to launder money through the protocol will be the only ones left without them, letting crypto exchanges and law enforcement identify and exclude these users.\n\nData of the week \u2014 Railgun overview\n\nPrivacy protocol Railgun\u2019s popularity has grown, even before Buterin mentioned it in his X post.\n\nRailgun has facilitated almost $1 billion in transaction volume since its launch in May 2022.\n\nrailgun Railgun is processing more transaction volume in recent months.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano has witnessed a substantial drop to the $0.4 region, suppressing the price by over 20%. Despite the dip, the ascent suggests a potential rally through the 200 EMA, challenging the downtrend with limited volatility and apathetic trade volume.\n\nCardano's price action has been a roller coaster, with its recent plunge to the $0.4 support level and a subsequent bounce back. At the time of writing, ADA has seen its value soar above $0.48, instilling a fresh wave of inflows into the market.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the descent has not influenced the coin\u2019s longer-term trend, which has been bearish with an absence of significant volume \u2014 a hint that the market is still in search of a solid direction. However, the surge above the 200 EMA will push the coin into the bullish zone once again.\n\nIf ADA fails, the $0.4 level remains a crucial bastion of support, and its endurance will be critical in preventing further declines. However, if the marketwide recovery continues, there is a good possibility of a prolonged continuation of the rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu takes hit\n\nShiba Inu has seen a sharp 30% decline. But one way or another, the only question in most holders' minds is: \"Will Shiba Inu really recover?\"\n\nThe token's dip to the $0.00002165 mark has been met with a mixture of concern and anticipation. A rebound from this level could signal a strong support base, potentially pivoting SHIB back into an uptrend.\n\nAs for the chart, the Bollinger Bands have been preceding the drop as their narrowing was a strong signal of an upcoming price surge. Now, with SHIB having slipped below the crucial 50-day moving average, the only thing left is to wait for a return above this aforementioned level.\n\nThe trading activity is pretty quiet, which shows that people are not too confident about SHIB right now. The RSI is suggesting that selling pressure prevailed over buys on the market, pushing the value of the token down.\n\nSHIB will face its first big test at the $0.00002880 level. If it can go beyond that, we might see the price move up toward $0.00003.\n\nAs for what's next for SHIB, it is really tough to say, considering the lack of fundamental development around Shiba Inu. However, there is always the possibility of a further price reversal and the return of the buying power on the market in general, which is going to push the value of tokens like Shiba Inu further up - especially if the risk appetite among investors returns.\n\nEthereum's comeback\n\nEthereum has made a strong and sufficient comeback, easily returning above the $3,000 threshold. The pivot suggests that Ethereum could continue its path upward despite this minor setback.\n\nFollowing the dip that moved the market, the price action has been affirmative, reclaiming the $3,000 mark with conviction. This level now forms a bedrock of support, cementing the current price range.\n\nSpecifically, the key support at approximately $2,700 is highlighted, a level where the asset has previously beaten the substantial buying pressure. The resistance can be found around the $3,600 zone.\n\nAs the price started rising, the volume started moving up, showing a lot of interest on the market. This rise in trading, along with the clear increase in price, has helped the upward trend to gain strength.\n\nThe intersection of technical indicators with market sentiment heralds a bullish scenario, where the previous peak at approximately $3,950 is not unreal.\n\nHowever, the most recent surge of volatility on the market might not go unnoticed, and it is important to avoid any risky moves that might drastically affect your portfolio."

Discover SCENE\n\nApeCoin, the Ethereum-based token tied to Yuga Labs\u2019 namesake NFT collection, is firmly in the doldrums alongside its Ape-themed analogs following a tumultuous week for the broader crypto markets.\n\nThe token has slipped 30% over the past seven days amid market turbulence sparked by growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Extending losses over the past year, the price of ApeCoin has plummeted 74% since this time last April to a current price of $1.19, according to CoinGecko.\n\nApeCoin\u2019s brush towards its all-time low price of $1.01 (set last October) comes as the token\u2019s official steward, the ApeCoin DAO, weighs several proposals from community members. Notable initiatives include establishing a \u201cdominant presence\u201d at an upcoming NFT conference in Portugal and a rewards app for ApeCoin and Yuga NFT holders.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s floor price, representative of the cheapest NFT from the collection listed for sale on a marketplace, has fallen 67% over the past year to $33,000 (11 ETH) from $103,000 (52 ETH), according to data from NFT Price Floor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat leaves the floor price for Bored Apes within 1 ETH striking distance of other notable PFP collections, including Pudgy Penguins, CyberKongz, and Grifters by XCOPY\u2014despite broader headwinds in the NFT market over the last year-plus.\n\nPublished at the exact BAYC top pic.twitter.com/xFBSzdR0JP \u2014 UubzU (oob-zoo) (@UubzU) April 15, 2024\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club became synonymous with NFTs as pricey, digital status symbols in 2021 and early 2022. And as Yuga Labs\u2019 Otherside game took aim at the metaverse, for example, Bored Apes peaked in floor price, reaching a minimum price of 152 ETH, or $429,000 in April 2022.\n\nApeCoin is expected to be the de facto currency for Yuga Labs\u2019 new projects, including the Otherside, which has held limited playtests but has yet to open up to players on an ongoing basis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn February, Otherside General Manager Eric Reid addressed the project\u2019s pace in a blog post, acknowledging that \u201cpeople are skeptical\u2014if not downright pissed\u2014from the lack of regular information on Otherside.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuilding something like Otherside is measured in years, not weeks or months,\u201d he continued. \u201cBuilding the platform and refining our long-term vision has been challenging.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Bored Ape community was confronted with a cultural loss. Two years after it opened, the Los Angeles-based burger joint Bored & Hungry shuttered its doors, hanging up its hat\u2014for the time being\u2014on monetizing IP from the NFT collection in the United States. But there are locations still open in Asia.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "The past week witnessed a significant downturn in Bitcoin\u2019s weekly inflow, which dwindled to $126 million amidst heightened market volatility. This decline was largely influenced by the prevailing uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin halving and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. These factors collectively exerted notable selling pressure, causing Bitcoin\u2019s price to plummet to a low plummet to a low of $61,600. The ripple effect extended to major altcoins, exacerbating the correction across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 latest report provided insights into the evolving landscape, particularly highlighting Bitcoin\u2019s cooling inflow compared to previous weeks. This contrast indicates a subtle retreat in investor participation, reflecting a degree of apprehension in the market. Conversely, Ethereum continued to face challenges, marking its 5th consecutive week of outflows, with $29 million exiting the market. These trends underscore the volatility and uncertainty prevailing within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, necessitating caution and strategic decision-making among investors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRegional Disparities and Investment Trends\n\nRegional disparities were evident in cryptocurrency investment trends, with the US witnessing the largest outflows totaling $145 million, followed closely by Switzerland and Canada. Despite these outflows, Germany emerged as a notable exception, capitalizing on recent price weakness as an opportunity for investment, with $29 million in inflows. This divergence highlights varying investor sentiments and strategies across different regions in response to market conditions.\n\nDespite Bitcoin experiencing outflows amounting to $110 million last week, it maintained positive inflows month-to-date, showcasing resilience amidst market turbulence. Furthermore, while altcoins, excluding Solana, exhibited positive performance, with lesser-known names like Decentraland, Basic Attention Token, and LIDO attracting inflows, suggesting diversification strategies among investors seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Ordinals Hints At Comeback Amid Bitcoin Halving And Runes Protocol Launch\n\nDigital Asset Investment Products and Investor Sentiment\n\nDigital asset investment products faced minor outflows totaling $126 million last week, indicating a degree of caution prevailing among investors amid stalled positive price momentum. This cautious sentiment was further reflected in the drop in ETF activity relative to the overall market, underscoring investor hesitancy in committing to cryptocurrency assets.\n\nHowever, amidst this cautious sentiment, short-bitcoin broke its 3-week spell of outflows, garnering minor inflows of $1.7 million. This move suggests a strategic response from investors possibly seeking to capitalize on recent price weakness and market fluctuations.\n\nAlso Read: Germany\u2019s Biggest Federal Bank Partners Bitpanda To Offer Crypto Custody\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Hong Kong has approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) applications. The region is the second to do so in 2024, following the SEC\u2019s (Securities and Exchange Commission) historic decision to approve 11 spot BTC ETFs in the US. However, although the US has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, the country has yet to greenlight an Ethereum ETF. According to some analysts, a spot ETH ETF could be approved in the US later this year.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 Hong Kong approves spot #Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF application. \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) April 15, 2024\n\nAlso Read: 3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Before They Hit the Big Post Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe approval of spot ETH and BTC ETFs may lead to another rally for the cryptocurrency markets. The US spot BTC ETFs played a significant role in BTC hitting a new all-time high earlier this year. BTC hit $73,737 in early March with a rally fuelled by increased inflows into spot BTC ETFs.\n\nWill Bitcoin and Ethereum rally after the ETF approval in Hong Kong?\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nGiven that the US spot BTC ETFs were responsible for BTC hitting a new all-time high, there is a high probability that a similar pattern will unfold after the Hong Kong approvals.\n\nAccording to CoinCodex, Bitcoin (BTC) will reclaim its all-time high later this month. Moreover, the platform anticipates BTC to continue on a bullish trajectory for the next few weeks, predicting it to hit $85,906 on May 13, 2024. Hitting $85,906 from current levels would translate to a growth of about 32%.\n\nOn the other hand, CoinCodex anticipates Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price to consolidate at around current levels, predicting it to trade at $3242.95 on May 1, 2024.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) halving just around the corner, we may witness another massive rally in the crypto market. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit new all-time highs, fuelled by the Hong Kong spot ETFs and BTC\u2019s halving later this month."

Railgun\u2019s native token, RAIL, experienced a sharp increase, climbing over 120% in value. This surge reflects a recurrent pattern where the endorsement or participation of high-profile figures like Buterin can influence market dynamics.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has fallen following recent crypto liquidations this week. While most outflows can be attributed to the general market sentiment, institutional funds play a major role in the asset\u2019s wider acceptance.\n\nThis year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs which saw an inflow of traditional investors in the market. Spot ETFs also gave the asset more legitimacy amid initial fears and uncertain regulation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSpot ETFs rallied the market pushing the price of the asset to an all-time high above $72,000 with bulls making higher projections. These inflows to Bitcoin and crypto assets turned institutional investors to Ethereum.\n\nReduced Institutional Flows\n\nThe clamor for a spot in Ethereum ETF garnered steam this year after multiple filings to the SEC. Institutional investors see the staking feature of Ethereum as a bullish driver for the asset price. Secondly, being the largest smart contract network, on-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) activities will surge the asset\u2019s price.\n\nHowever, the price of the assets has plummeted in recent weeks and its existing institutional products have seen sharp outflows. On April 15, a report from CoinShares showed a $22 million outflow from Ethereum last week. These flows bring total monthly exits to $51.3 million. However year-to-date flows stand at $23 million.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Last week, investors were hesitant as the positive price momentum stalled.

Bitcoin\u2019s AUM soared with its price in Q4 2023 while Ethereum\u2019s products are at $13.8 billion despite widespread anticipations.\n\nEthereum Price To Recover?\n\nThe price of Ethereum is down due to macroeconomic factors and reduced sentiment but institutional flows have contributed to the status quo. At press time, Ethereum price is at $3,052, a 13% drop this week and 15% this month.\n\nBulls maintain optimism of a possible run should spot Ethereum ETF get approval in the United States.

Forbes highlights that crypto investors already anticipate that Hong Kong and the United States will battle for cryptocurrency inflows into their respective funds due to the revelations.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe demand that these ETFs are going to create might be way more than what is in supply.

Thus, at this point, it appears unlikely that it will have access to Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs that are listed in Hong Kong.

In a recent interview, the exec claimed,\n\n\u201cRight now, the U.S. has not approved any spot products. So, the Hong Kong managers are certainly standing in a very good position when they launch the ETH products in Hong Kong for sure.\u201d\n\nOSL was approved as the first sub-custodian partner for ChinaAMC\u2019s BTC and ETH ETFs.\n\nIt is worth noting that the US spot ETH ETFs May approval odds have dimmed amidst the US SEC\u2019s silence on the filings. But that\u2019s not the only edge Hong Kong\u2019s ETFs could have over the US.\n\nBTC, ETH ETFs in-kind subscription\n\nThe ETF product from Bosera, in partnership with HashKey Capital, will have an \u201cin-kind\u201d subscription. It means that users can subscribe directly to the ETF shares using BTC or ETH.\n\nAlternatively, investors can redeem their shares and receive actual BTC or ETH in return. On the contrary, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs only allow cash settlements on the underlying asset.\n\nInvestor and crypto market commentator, Simon Mow, highlighted the difference as an opportunity for Asia to accumulate more BTC.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs will feature in-kind creation and redemption. This is a move to one-up the U.S. ETFs. The race is on to accumulate BTC in Asia\u201d\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $66K, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap, a few hours after the approvals.\n\nHowever, Antony Scarramucci, Bitcoin maxi, and former White House executive, claimed that the development hasn\u2019t been priced yet.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Not priced in.\u201d\n\nVanEck analysts had previously said Chinese investors were behind the recent gold accumulation and price surge. Ergo, the analyst viewed the approval of the Hong Kong ETFs as a rallying force for BTC.\n\nBut, the ETFs\u2019 first trading dates haven\u2019t been disclosed. It is worth noting that the Hong Kong approvals show most parts of the vetting process are complete.\n\nThe launch and first day of trading will happen later and hasn\u2019t been disclosed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nEven so, Gary Tiu of OSL affirmed that the approvals show that the launch day is \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nThe approval of spot ETH ETFs makes Asia a first-mover. However, it remains to be seen how the overall market will react to the ETFs when they begin trading."

ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a sharp uptick on the 15th of April.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar trend, hinting at a continued price increase. ETH\u2019s price rebounded from the lower limit of the Bollinger Bands, further suggesting that the bull rally might continue.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nOur look at Hyblock Capital\u2019s data pointed out quite a few levels that ETH might reach this week if the bull rally actually sustains. The first target for ETH might be $3.34k, as liquidation would rise at that level.\n\nIf a successful breakout happens above that, then ETH might as well touch $3.6k or even $3.8k in the following days."

        "title": "Is Ethereum behind Render\u2019s 18% rally? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The token\u2019s value increased, and so did ETH.\n\nRNDR\u2019s popularity grew among traders, suggesting a significant price hike in the long term.\n\nRender [RNDR], the native token of the distributed GPU network built on Ethereum [ETH] jumped by an incredible 18.85% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThis performance made RNDR one of the top assets with the best recovery rate after the broader market experienced a drawdown. Interestingly, the bounce happened as ETH itself was able to reclaim $3,000 and rise above it.\n\nHowever, there were other reasons the price of RNDR increased. The first thing AMBCrypto noticed was the increase in social dominance.\n\nDid ETH \u201cRender\u201d help?\n\nAnalyzing data from LunarCrush, we observed that Render\u2019s social dominance increased by a mind-blowing 116% within the same timeframe the value skyrocketed.\n\nThe increase in social dominance implied that the project\u2019s popularity among traders surged. From our findings, traders were attracted to RNDR because of its fundamentals.\n\nAnyone conversant with the market would have observed that many market participants are bullish on projects with the DePIN narrative. DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks.\n\nIn the crypto space, projects built around this narrative like Render, use tokens to incentivize holders who utilize the protocol.\n\nFurthermore, AMBCrypto observed another proof of the interest in RNDR. This time, it was the trading volume. According to Santiment, Render\u2019s trading volume rose to 556.65 million on the 14th of April.\n\nThis increase represented a 37.72% jump from the value on the 13th. However, the volume decreased slightly at press time, indicating that RNDR might not have a solid backing to continue its upswing.\n\nSentiment stays the same\n\nDespite RNDR\u2019s potential, it seemed traders were not yet convinced about its short-term performance. This was evident from the Weighted Sentiment analyzed on-chain.\n\nThe metric tracks the average positive or negative comment about a project. If the reading is positive, it means most market participants have a bullish view. On the other hand, a negative reading suggests a bearish perception.\n\nAt press time, Render\u2019s Weighted Sentiment was -0.45. With this position, demand for RNDR might decrease in the short term. Should this be the case, the price of the token might fall below $9.\n\nBut that does invalidate the long-term optimism around the project. AMBCrypto concluded this after checking the amount of holders.\n\nOn the 25th of March, the total amount of RNDR holders was less than 80,000. However, that figure had increased to 85,600 at press time.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s RNDR\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nAn increase in the number of holders was a sign of traction on the network and adoption of the token. If this continues, RNDR\u2019s price could head to new highs.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there might be corrections in the process. But as long as the DePIN narrative remains relevant in the market, the token might be destined for a higher value."

        "content": "eth-usd\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is eagerly awaiting Bitcoin halving to see what will happen to the values of key cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is up today but has lost much of its recent gains. The coin is hanging close to the $3K mark with a price of $3,076 (ETH/USD). For now, the coin is down 15% over the last month. That mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the last 30 days as well- slightly up today, but significantly down overall.\n\nBoth coins have been struggling lately and may continue to do so unless the halving can inject some momentum into them. Ethereum\u2019s trade volume is dipping, down 9% from the previous day, and many investors seem to be adopting a stance of wait and see what happens after the halving.\n\nHow Ethereum Could Hit $4,000 This year\n\nIf the ETH price is going to make it to $4,000 in 2024 as many industry insiders say, then a few key factors will have to work in its favor. The first of those is Bitcoin\u2019s halving, which could give Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other crypto coins a significant boost.\n\nNext, ETF approval for Ethereum could help it along as well, making Ethereum seem more stable, at least in one of its forms. ETF approval is still pending in some parts of the world, but a number of countries have approved ETFs already. The latest of those was Hong Kong, which gave the legal nod to ETFs on Monday. Because ETF approval is an ongoing process, we could see major ramifications for Ethereum all throughout the year from this sector.\n\nThere are also a number of cryptocurrency regulations in the pipeline that could be approved or denied, and these are proposed laws from many different countries. If some of those are passed in favor of crypto currency, Ethereum will be able to enjoy some positive press and greater consumer confidence."

        "content": "Solana has rapidly gained attention in the crypto market due to its high speed, low transaction fees, and scalability, setting it apart from Ethereum and other blockchains. These attributes make Solana a promising alternative for developers and users looking for a low-cost and fast trading experience.\n\nSolana and its community members are optimistic about the future trajectory of the project due to network developments. Ethereum has also undergone several updates in recent weeks. This article will discuss the current developments in the Solana and Ethereum networks and their market performance to access the next leading token in the upcoming bull market.\n\nSolana rolls out v1.17.31 update to solve congestion issues\n\nSolana (SOL) has been among the list of top-performing cryptocurrencies recently. With massive on-chain activity and transactions, the Solana blockchain has witnessed network outages several times indicating its expanding user base and market traction. With the launch of new meme coins, Solana\u2019s DEX volume has surged to $1B again.\n\nTo overcome the congestion issues to hold large transactional activity on the Solana blockchain, Solana developers rolled out a network upgrade, version 1.18.11 on the devnet. After this initial step, on April 15, Solana announced the deployment of version 1.17.31 on the mainnet affirming improvements aimed at eliminating existing congestion issues until the official release of version 1.18 on the mainnet.\n\n.@Solana MainnetBeta validators: the v1.17.31 release is now recommended for general use. This patch contains enhancements which will help alleviate some of the ongoing network congestion, and will be followed by further enhancements in v1.18. Please upgrade when there\u2019s less\u2026 \u2014 Anza (@anza_xyz) April 15, 2024\n\nWhales accumulate ETH tokens worth $278 million\n\nEthereum (ETH) has witnessed a surge in network activity as investors accumulate ETH tokens during the market dip. With the potential to surpass $8000 in the upcoming bull market, investors show optimism toward Ethereum\u2019s trajectory. According to reports, whale transactions recorded $278 million worth of ETH tokens across various wallets.\n\nDespite the recent 8% correction in the $ETH price (24H), whales are still buying $ETH! 1. Whale 0x435 spent 70M$ USDC to buy 23,790 $ETH at ~$2,942 4 hours ago: \u2022 In total, the whale has accumulated 60,808 $ETH ($191M) from #Binance and DEX in the past 15 hours, after each\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ujZRULGAkX \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 14, 2024\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong on April 15 marks a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem. Moreover, Puffer Finance, a liquid staking project built on Ethereum\u2019s restaking protocol has secured $18 million in funding to launch its mainnet. This technology allows Ethereum validators to reduce their capital requirement to just 1 ETH, significantly lower than the previous 32 ETH requirement.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum\n\nWhile both Ethereum and Solana are leading figures in the DeFi space, Solana has the potential to outperform Ethereum in the upcoming bull run. This is not historically impossible as Solana surpassed Ethereum in DEX volume amid the recent meme rally, a significant milestone for its ecosystem and community.\n\nWhile Both these legacy projects compete for the leading position, market analysts project another emerging deFi project which can outpace Ethereum due to massive potential much faster than Solana. DTX Exchange is a hybrid platform currently in its presale which is set to moonshot once it goes live in the main market.\n\nDTX Exchange is ready to lead the deFi space with $230k raised in presale\n\nThe emerging 1000x leverage platform, DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to revolutionize trading and investment with unprecedented trading features. The platform maximizes the profit margins and provides accessible trading to empower early traders.\n\nThe platform offers distributive liquidity pools to reduce slippage so investors can mitigate risks associated with concentrated liquidity, allowing trading across diverse markets including forex, crypto, equities, and CFDs.\n\nWith a robust infrastructure and unmatched security features, DTX Exchange provides an exceptional trading experience with no KYC fuss and non-custodial wallets so holders can trade freely with their digital assets across any exchange without the fear of security breach.\n\nThe crypto community eyes DTX as the next leading project in the deFi space after it raised expectations by raising $230k in public presale stage 1 within a few days. The presale price of $0.02 marks an ideal time for early adopters to be a part of a bright future with DTX, with massive growth potential and access to governance and mega airdrops.\n\nLearn more:\n\nVisit DTX Presale\n\nRead Whitepaper\n\nJoin The DTX Community\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange traded fund (ETF) applicants in Hong Kong posted on social media that authorities had approved their applications. The region will be the first in Asia to offer spot ETFs. Is this the beginning of Hong Kong\u2019s crypto dominance?\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nAfter the weekend\u2019s volatility due to the increasing conflict in the Middle East, crypto saw some positive news coming from Hong Kong yesterday. Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange traded fund (ETF) applicants in Hong Kong posted on social media that authorities had approved their applications. The region will be the first in Asia to offer spot ETFs. Is this the beginning of Hong Kong\u2019s crypto dominance?\n\nOn Monday, four China and Hong Kong-based asset managers stated they have received approval for their spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF applications. The \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle uniquely positions Hong Kong as China\u2019s bridge to international financing. However, tight Chinese government capital controls limit international investments in non-yuan denominated assets. Regardless, an exodus of capital has occurred in Chinese markets, as perceptions of China\u2019s economic prospects remain pessimistic. Deteriorating profits for Chinese financial firms appears to be a catalyst for change. Asset managers are now more open to diversifying their product offering into an emerging sector, such as crypto, through enabling ETFs.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the Shanghai Composite Index is down by over 8%. In comparison, the US\u2019s S&P 500 is up nearly 25% and Bitcoin is up by nearly 120%. Gold has also experienced recent appreciation, as it pushed to new all-time highs on Friday of nearly $2,400. Gold\u2019s move has been driven by Chinese citizens according to John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council. Eric Balchunas also reported last week that Chinese buying pushed a gold stock ETF to a 30% premium before it halted trading. Evidently, Chinese demand for decentralised international assets, acting as stores of value, is high.\n\nHowever, for now, Chinese investors are still unable to legally buy crypto, even if the demand is there. China has seemingly banned crypto several times, with the 2021 ban still in place. Nevertheless, non-compliance has not stopped Chinese investors from stacking crypto. According to ChainAnalysis, from May 2022 to June 2023, Chinese crypto volumes reached $86 billion, with Hong Kong\u2019s volumes hitting $64 billion.\n\nHowever, Hong Kong may have incoming crypto ETF competition in Asia. South Korea\u2019s newly elected government has vowed to support Bitcoin spot ETFs. South Korean crypto demand is so high, Bitcoin is currently trading at a 7% premium on South Korean exchange UpBit. The exchange\u2019s trading volumes also skyrocketed by over 172% from February to March. Let\u2019s see who wins the battle for Asian crypto supremacy."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s price saw a notable recovery on Monday after a steep decline over the past seven days. This was supported by positive developments in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets, which came alongside the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for both cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong.\n\nAdditionally, Solana addressed its ongoing network congestion issues with a new update, aiming to rectify transaction failures and outages.\n\nNew Update Tackling Implementation Bug\n\nAccording to Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, Solana\u2019s recent network congestion issues were attributed to an implementation bug rather than a fundamental design flaw. Mumtaz clarified that Solana\u2019s current predicament results from a flaw in implementing a specific protocol.\n\nAccording to Anza, a spin-off of Solana Labs, Solana has released a new update to its validator client software to combat this. The update, v1.17.31, aims to reduce network congestion and will be followed by further improvements in v1.18.\n\nAnza emphasized the update\u2019s significance, urging MainnetBeta validators to adopt it. The enhancements introduced in the update are expected to mitigate Solana\u2019s ongoing network congestion issues.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Goes Pro: UFC Winner Wants $300,000 Bonus Paid In BTC 5 months ago\n\nFurthermore, validators were advised to upgrade their systems when there is less than 5% delinquent stake, ensuring they have sufficient time to monitor the node after the upgrade.\n\nAny issues encountered during the upgrade were to be reported to \u2060mb-validators. Solana Status, a trusted source, corroborated the announcement, recommending the v1.17.31 release for general use.\n\nTrent.sol, Solana\u2019s developer and operations manager, emphasized that the effectiveness of the update would be proportional to its adoption across the network.\n\nWhile the improvements primarily target Solana\u2019s Stake Weighted Quality of Service (SWQOS) and may not result in significant changes to the reliability of unstacked Tensor processing units (TPU) traffic, Solana users were advised to keep delinquency below 5% during the upgrade process.\n\nFurthermore, Anza hinted at additional enhancements in the pipeline, urging users to stay tuned for further updates.\n\nSolana Price Rebounds With 7% Surge\n\nAfter unveiling updates to enhance network efficiency, the Solana price has surged by over 7%. This surge has helped offset the ongoing downtrend experienced by Solana, which amounted to nearly 21% over the past month.\n\nIn addition, the Hong Kong SFC has officially approved several spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including asset managers such as China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, HashKey Capital Limited, and an in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments.\n\nThis regulatory approval has not only positively impacted the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum but has also instilled a sense of positivity in the overall cryptocurrency market. As a result, the top 10 cryptocurrencies have witnessed significant uptrends, riding on the wave of these developments.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nDespite the recent surge in Solana\u2019s price, SOL\u2019s trading volume has decreased by -44.70% in the last 24 hours, indicating a recent decline in market activity, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nSolana\u2019s current trading price of $151.40 presents the first obstacle in the cryptocurrency\u2019s path toward further price gains. If this hurdle is surpassed, the next significant resistance lies at $170, which would signify a recovery of SOL\u2019s gains recorded over the past month.\n\nOn the other hand, the $130 mark has proven to be a strong support level for Solana, representing the foundation of SOL\u2019s one-month bullish structure, which propelled its price rally to nearly three-year highs of $210 on March 18.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has officially approved several spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a decision that marks a significant development in the region\u2019s burgeoning crypto market. These approvals were granted to prominent asset managers including China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, and HashKey Capital Limited, alongside an in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s SFC Approves Bitcoin And ETH ETFs\n\nChina Asset Management\u2019s Hong Kong unit, as detailed in their press release, has received SFC approval to launch spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This initiative is part of a collaboration with OSL Digital Securities Limited and BOCI International, aiming to provide retail asset management services with direct cryptocurrency subscriptions.\n\nSimilarly, Bosera Asset Management and HashKey Capital have announced that they have received conditional approval from the SFC for their own spot crypto ETFs. These products, named the Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF and the Bosera HashKey Ether ETF, will allow investors to directly use Bitcoin and Ethereum to subscribe for ETF shares, as stated in their press release.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nHarvest Global Investments has also been spotlighted with the SFC\u2019s in-principle nod for two major digital asset spot ETFs. According to their press release, Mr. Tongli Han, CEO and CIO of Harvest Global Investments, remarked, \u201cThis in-principle approval for Harvest Global Investments\u2019 products in two major digital asset spot ETFs not only underscores Hong Kong\u2019s competitive edge in the digital asset space, but also demonstrates our unrelenting pursuit of promoting innovation in the industry and meeting diversified investor needs.\u201d\n\nThese ETFs are set to be launched through a partnership with OSL Digital Securities, the first digital asset platform licensed and insured by the SFC, highlighting a significant stride in addressing common market challenges such as excessive margin requirements and price premiums.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Stays Sub $70,000 As Hong Kong Readies April-End ETF Launch 5 months ago\n\nThe press release from Bosera and HashKey highlights that the introduction of these virtual asset spot ETFs will not only provide new asset allocation opportunities but also reinforce Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international financial center and a hub for virtual assets. This move is aligned with the city\u2019s strategic push to establish itself as a regional leader in financial innovation, particularly in the digital asset sector.\n\nThe approvals are indicative of Hong Kong\u2019s progressive regulatory framework which aims to integrate digital assets within its financial ecosystem safely and securely. The establishment of these ETFs is expected to provide a regulated, innovative investment avenue for both retail and institutional investors in the region. While there is not as much hype as there is around US ETFs, some analysts believe the impact could be similar.\n\nThese approvals come on the heels of rumors last Friday about the potential approval of these ETFs. The market had been abuzz with speculations, and today\u2019s confirmation has provided the Bitcoin and ETH prices with a much needed boost. BTC is up 2.2% since the announcement, surpassing the $66,000 mark. The approved ETFs are reportedly set to launch by the end of April.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $66,535.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum in Trouble: What\u2019s Going On?\n\nStory Highlights Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are down significantly, likely due to recent geopolitical tensions.\n\nDespite typical pre-halving surges, the market is tumbling instead, causing investor panic and selloffs.\n\nWhile investors flee, traders are jumping in, but this doesn't indicate overall bullish sentiment.\n\nThe crypto world is once again engulfed in a downward spiral, with major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum showing significant losses. As of now, Bitcoin has dropped by nearly 5% in the past day, while Ethereum\u2019s decrease exceeds 5%. Even BNB and Solana haven\u2019t escaped unscathed, experiencing declines of 7% and 10% respectively.\n\nThe Pre-Halving Frenzy\n\nWith investors scratching their heads over the market\u2019s turmoil, it\u2019s essential to delve into the factors driving this dramatic downturn.\n\nThe much-anticipated Bitcoin halving is just around the corner, set to happen in about four days. Historically, halving events have been met with excitement, leading to significant price surges before, during, and after. At the start of 2024, Bitcoin broke not one but two all-time highs, sparking optimistic predictions from industry experts and outsiders alike. FOMO was rampant, driving market activity into a frenzy. It seemed like smooth sailing for cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut It Was a Bust!\n\nThe party didn\u2019t last long. Corrections, a typical occurrence before halving events, soon kicked in. Experts reassured investors, but over the weekend, the market witnessed a plunge reminiscent of the early-year volatility.\n\nGlobal Turmoil Meets Crypto Chaos\n\nThe brewing geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel spilled over into the crypto world, as cryptocurrencies became the go-to assets during the crisis. Investors panicked and swiftly sold off their holdings, triggering a market-wide downturn.\n\nThis sparked a flurry of sell-offs, with hundreds of millions of dollars being dumped in just two days. Interestingly, this chaos led to a surge in trading activity on major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Bybit.\n\nAn Opportunity for Investors?\n\nWhile investors fled, savvy traders seized the moment. It\u2019s a common trend; when markets go haywire, opportunities for traders abound. However, it\u2019s important to note that this doesn\u2019t necessarily signal bullish sentiment. Recent data from Coinglass highlights a significant increase in Bitcoin derivatives trading, with volumes soaring by over 10% in a single day, reaching a staggering $99 billion. The prevailing long/short ratio suggests a predominantly bearish sentiment among traders.\n\nDespite the turbulence, experts remain optimistic, maintaining their predictions of Bitcoin soaring to $100k, Ethereum reaching $10k, and BNB hitting $5k."

One may not call me a crypto \u201cEnthusiast\u201d but trust me I'm getting there.\n\nCrypto analyst Crypto Kid delivered a mixed message to the cryptocurrency community, sounding the alarm on a potential Bitcoin downturn.\n\nWhile acknowledging the short-term dip, Crypto Kid delved into the analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s price action, highlighting the formation of a double top pattern and the significance of key support levels. He outlined potential scenarios, indicating that if Bitcoin fails to find support at critical levels, a further decline to $66.7k could signal a bearish trend reversal.\n\nHe talked about how history often repeats itself in the cryptocurrency market. Back in 2020, Bitcoin followed a pattern where it formed a bullish pennant, took some time to consolidate, and then surged. He compared this to his current analysis, suggesting that Bitcoin could follow a similar path, possibly hitting $90k-$92k or even $100k.\n\n\n\nHe also mentioned a potential rise in altcoins. Regarding Ethereum, he noted that it hasn\u2019t reached a new all-time high yet, but he predicted it could reach $6,800 based on its current trend.\n\nHowever, amidst the cautionary tone, Crypto Kid shifted gears to discuss the potentially game-changing news of Hong Kong spot ETF approvals. He stressed the significance of these approvals, noting that they could unlock billions of dollars in capital inflow into Bitcoin.\n\nRead Also : Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Will Bears Dominate Halving Spree?\n\nWith Bloomberg expecting an approval announcement as early as Monday, Crypto Kid painted a bullish picture of the potential influx of institutional and retail investment into Bitcoin.\n\nDrawing parallels to previous market trends, Crypto Kid predicted a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price following the approval of spot ETFs, fueled by FOMO from Asian investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through regulated investment vehicles. He cited the success of other ETFs and the massive inflows they attracted, indicating the potential for similar, if not greater, enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nDid You Know : MicroStrategy Doubles Bitcoin Profits as BTC Price Soars 463%"

When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Price Prediction For This Week: Will Bears Dominate Halving Spree?\n\nThe crypto markets took a hit from the rising CPI data in the U.S., increasing the volatility in the already volatile market. With close relations to the U.S. market, despite being the flag-bearer of decentralization, Bitcoin\u2019s price crumbled this week.\n\nWith a sharp 4% fall last night, Bitcoin\u2019s price closed the day at $67,150, recovering from the low of $65,320. The downfall of the market leader sent a bearish ripple through the altcoin sector.\n\nThe sell-off wave erased $784 Million in long liquidations this Friday, as per the data from Coinglass.\n\nSo, with the bearish prowess growing strong, will the Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP price trends take a nosedive next week? Or, will the growing anticipations around Bitcoin Halving kickstart a bull run like a phoenix out of its ashes?\n\nIs $100,000 Just A Pipe Dream For Bitcoin?\n\nAmidst the market-wide panic, the BTC price chart shows a massive bearish candle arising from the overhead trendline. This pullback tests the 50D EMA and signals a minor correction within the bullish flag.\n\nTradingview\n\nFurther, despite the sell-off, Bitcoin sustains above the 23.60% Fibonacci level and presents a lower price rejection. Hence, the underlying demand remains significant for Bitcoin.\n\nHence, as the day of Bitcoin halving comes closer, the chances of a bullish spike are increasing. With this surge, the BTC price could lead to a breakout rally of a flag pattern to prolong the prevailing uptrend.\n\nAs per the price levels and the psychological barriers, the biggest crypto could reach the $100,000 mark. However, in the short-term, the coming week could find the bullish surge driving the BTC price higher to $76,000.\n\nEthereum Under Stress, Tension Grows Over $3,000 Level\n\nWith the Bitcoin price under correction, the biggest altcoin shares the heat of increased supply in the market. However, the Ethereum price is sustained above the psychological mark of $3,000, with a long-term projection of a lower price rejection.\n\nTradingview\n\nThe lower price rejection shows a similar underlying demand to Bitcoin, increasing the reversal chances. However, the 7.50% drop last night closes the ETH price under the broken resistance trendline of a rising channel.\n\nThis questions the reversal possibility. Nevertheless, the RSI divergence in the ETH price trend bolsters the possibility of reversal.\n\nFurther, as per the trend-based Fibonacci levels, the ETH price could hit the $4,000 mark for a new breakout attempt.\n\nWill The Sleeping Giant Wake Up This April?\n\nWith a massive supply dump in Bitcoin and Ethereum, altcoins like Ripple have no other option but to face a similar fate. The XRP token price loses 10% of its market value to fall to $0.54.\n\nTradingview\n\nThe downfall tests the bullish dominance at the ascending support trendline in action since early 2023. Further, the dynamic resistance in the weekly timeframe fails to provide any significant momentum for a reversal.\n\nNevertheless, the RSI divergence, coupled with the lower price rejection at the baseline, hints at a stronger comeback. The altcoin could surge this week to break the triangle if the highly anticipated altcoin season arrives with Bitcoin Halving.\n\nAs per trend-based Fibonacci levels, the $0.8966 level is a suitable target for the triangle breakout rally.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price?\n\nDespite the sell-off last night, the Bitcoin and altcoins are preparing for a fightback next week. The lower price rejection, prevailing uptrend and the upcoming Halving could boost the market to new heights. Hence, the downfall brings an opportunity to buy blue-chip crypto at a discount."
