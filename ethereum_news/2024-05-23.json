        "title": "SEC approval of Ether ETFs acknowledges Ether is a commodity - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight spot Ether ETFs in a bulk order. However, there is another formality before they can be sold to the public, which may take a few months. A key aspect of the order is that each ETF is considered a \u2018Commodity-Based Trust Share\u2019. Several years ago the SEC classified Ether as a commodity, but that changed over a year ago without any announcement. It concluded that Ether had become a security following the migration to Ethereum 2.0, which adopted Proof of Stake. This came to light due to Ethereum development house Consensys suing the SEC over claims that Ether is a security.\n\nTherefore, the ETF\u2019s recognition of Ether as a commodity marks a significant reversal. There\u2019s considerable debate about the reason for the abrupt shift. With Congress passing the FIT 21 crypto Bill this week with the backing of many Democrats, the politics around crypto is shifting. That\u2019s particularly in the run up to an election where the Biden administration\u2019s crypto stance might be viewed as a potential vote loser.\n\nInterestingly, the SEC Commissioners did not directly vote on the ETFs, unlike the Bitcoin ETFs. Instead, they delegated the authority to the Division of Trading and Markets. While delegation is a common practice, it\u2019s notable that this decision would not have been made without the majority of the Commissioners\u2019 approval, as highlighted by Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart.\n\nThe eight ETFs are from Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock\u2019s iShares, VanEck, ARK 21shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.\n\nConsensys to continue its fight\n\nMeanwhile, Consensys has vowed to continue with its litigation against the SEC. \u201cToday\u2019s approval signals that the SEC views that ETH is a commodity and not a security \u2013 contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week, as described in our recent lawsuit against the SEC,\u201d the company wrote on X. \u201cWe will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity in our case.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cthis seemingly last minute approval is yet another example of the SEC\u2019s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the crypto community that\u2019s been unhappy with the SEC. Both Congress and the Senate voted in favor of a resolution to overturn an SEC accounting bulletin (SAB 121) that effectively blocks banks from providing digital asset custody. It is the first digital assets-related law passed by both legislative branches, yet another sign of the changing political tide. However, the White House has vowed to veto it."

        "title": "How To Short Ether - Investopedia",
        "content": "Short Selling Ethereum\n\nShort selling Ethereum (ETH) involves borrowing ether and immediately selling it, with the plan to buy it back when prices drop. This strategy is used by traders with a bearish outlook on the market to take advantage of declining prices.\n\nA successful short provides a profit of the difference between the sale and repurchase price, less any fees. But it's a strategy that offers the potential for unlimited losses. ETH is a notoriously volatile asset, and losses can mount quickly. To cite an example, on May 21, 2024, the price of ETH spiked 22% in 24 hours on news of a potential ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF), causing over $280 million in losses marketwide on short selling.\n\nBelow, we take you through several ways to short the cryptocurrency.\n\nKey Takeways Short selling ether is borrowing ETH, selling it, and repurchasing it after prices drop.\n\nShort selling ether generally requires a margin account on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nShorting ETH allows traders to potentially profit when the price falls. This can be a way to hedge other crypto holdings or capitalize on bearish market sentiment.\n\nWhile it offers the potential for high rewards, shorting ETH carries the risk of unlimited losses.\n\nTraders can use alternative strategies instead of short selling ether, such as buying short ether ETFs.\n\nHow Shorting Ethereum Works\n\nShort selling refers to when an investor borrows an asset\u2014in this case, ETH\u2014and sells it on the open market, planning to repurchase it later for less. The exchanges that allow you to short ETH often require you to hold a margin account. These accounts allow you to borrow money to buy assets, in this case, ETH. What's borrowed, called \"margin,\" is often used to augment your buying power and potentially amplify your gains.\n\nIn May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX the approval to list Ether Spot ETFs. These instruments are similar to the Bitcoin Spot ETFs approved earlier in the year.\n\nSimilar to shorting a regular ETF, once the SEC approves an ETH ETF, you can borrow shares from the broker, sell them immediately, buy them back when prices fall, and then return the shares.\n\nSuppose you think ETH is due to drop in price soon, and you have $10,000 in your margin account, which allows you to trade up to twice what you have in the account. The price of ETH on crypto exchanges is about $4,000. Here are the steps:\n\nBorrow on margin: You decide to use the maximum leverage allowed and borrow an additional $10,000 from your broker, giving you $20,000 to trade. Shorting ETH: You use the entire $20,000 to short sell five ETH. This means you're selling five ETH you've borrowed from the broker, expecting to buy them back later at a lower price. Price drop: As you predicted, the price of ETH plummets to $3,000. Close the position: You buy back five ETH at the new, lower price of $3,000, spending a total of $15,000. Profit time: You return the five borrowed ETH to the broker and walk away with a $5,000 profit (minus any fees or interest).\n\nUsing ETH Futures ETFs\n\nEther futures ETFs began trading in October 2023. If you have a margin account that allows short selling, you can sell short one or more of these Ether ETFs to profit from falling ETH prices.\n\nIf you don't have the desire to sell ETH futures ETF shares short, another option is to purchase a short cryptocurrency ETF, like the Proshares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH). This ETF attempts to return the inverse of the Bloomberg Galaxy Ethereum Index."

        "title": "Ethereum heats up over key ETF decision. Here's what you need to know. - Mashable",
        "content": "Ethereum, the nerdy cryptocurrency that was lately overshadowed by Bitcoin, is in the news again, and the price is pumping. What gives?\n\nWell, only one of the most important developments in Ethereum's history, anon. An Ethereum spot ETF (Exchange Traded-Fund) might get approved in the U.S. today \u2014 that's Thursday, May 23.\n\nUPDATE: May. 24, 2024, 11:51 a.m. CEST The first Ethereum ETFs indeed got the nod from regulators on Thursday, though there's more steps and hoops to jump through (see part on the S-1 form below) before they can actually start trading.\n\nBefore we get into all that, here's a very short primer on Ethereum or ETH. Launched in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin and others, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin, and it has been so for the better part of the past five years or so.\n\nWhat is this Ethereum thing you speak of?\n\nEthereum is a very different beast from Bitcoin. The latter is a digital currency and a public ledger of transactions that uses a network of computers (miners) to securely verify every transaction in the system, as well as create new coins through a computing-intensive process called proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform for decentralized apps. Unlike Bitcoin, it uses proof-of-stake to power and secure the network, meaning there is no environmentally unfriendly mining, with validators using a stake of their ether or ETH (the underlying currency of the platform) to validate transactions. Also, unlike Bitcoin, which is all about the secure sending and receiving of bitcoins and fairly little else, Ethereum is a platform for other decentralized apps (also called smart contracts) to run on.\n\nAs you can imagine, this makes Ethereum more powerful than Bitcoin in a sense, but it also makes it more complicated, both in terms of usage and implications. These days, basically everyone \u2014 the likes of large banks and pensions funds included \u2014 understands Bitcoin to be a largely decentralized digital asset, which can be bought, securely stored and sold, akin to a digital version of gold. Ethereum is a lot more complicated, with the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) not being entirely clear on whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nAn ETH ETF is now a very real possibility\n\nThis leads us to the part about ETFs. In January 2024, after receiving the SEC's blessing, Bitcoin spot ETF funds started trading in the United States. This had immense implications as to who can buy Bitcoin; suddenly, a U.S. state pension fund or an investment fund was able to easily get exposure to Bitcoin without worrying about breaking some rule. And the \"spot\" part, in contrast to a futures ETF, means that the Bitcoin spot ETFs must buy actual Bitcoins when someone buys their product.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Sign Me Up By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\n\nThe interest was record-breaking, with more than $13 billion flowing into BTC via spot ETFs since their inception. And unsurprisingly, the price of Bitcoin soared from around $42,000 in early January to roughly $69,500 at writing time.\n\nMany of the same entities \u2014 large investment companies such as BlackRock, VanEck, and Ark \u2014 also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF, with deadlines for SEC's approval or denial starting on May 23. And up until a few days ago, analysts largely believed that the ETFs would be denied, given SEC's previous reluctance to provide clear guidance over whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nThis has changed. According to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas, there was \"chatter\" that the SEC has completely reversed its stance on Ethereum, followed by a slew of potential ETF issuers submitting amended 19b-4 forms to the SEC, signaling that there's a very good chance that the ETFs are on their way for approval.\n\nWe know, the sheer mention of something like a 19b-4 form made you fall asleep instantly. But we mention it because there's another set of forms that need to be approved, the S-1 forms, and those are key for actual ETF approval.\n\nIn practice, this means we could get a very good indication that one or more (probably more) Ethereum ETFs are coming, but it might take weeks or months before they actually start trading.\n\nAs a result of these filings, the price of Ethereum rose from around $3,100 to $3,800, where it's trading at writing time.\n\nOf course, nothing is official or set in stone. The Ethereum ETF applications could still get denied, though the consensus among experts is that it's now a question of when, not if, it will happen. A denial would surely be a cold shower for Ethereum's price, at least in the short term.\n\nThis is one of the most important developments for crypto, period\n\nThis is not just about Ethereum's price. This sudden change of sentiment by the SEC could mean that the U.S. government is suddenly far more open to everything crypto related. Indeed, an important crypto bill was just passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, despite the SEC head Gary Gensler having some very stern words about it.\n\nPerhaps the simplest of implications of this approval is other crypto spot ETFs getting the nod in the future. But with BlackRock launching a tokenized version of its money-market fund on Ethereum, it's getting easy to envision a future in which a big chunk of global finance exists on the blockchain. In other words, your nerdy, crypto-mining neighbor who told you that one day all of finance will roll into crypto, may have actually been right.\n\nWhat now?\n\nWell, unless you're a trader looking to capitalize on price moves, you don't really have to do anything. Regardless of whether the Ethereum spot ETF is denied, approved, or delayed today, Ethereum and its ecosystem of apps will keep trudging along.\n\nBut it is important to consider that a potential approval fully legitimizes an entire new class of crypto assets. Institutions, funds, banks, perhaps even pension funds, will be looking to get in on the action, and it could spark a thriving period for Ethereum, as well as the apps and assets that reside on it. After a bit of a lull in the past couple of years, the crypto space could once again become very exciting over the next couple of years."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has green-lighted the listing of eight spot Ether exchange-traded fund on U.S. stock exchanges, approving the asset manager\u2019s 19b-4 form on Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest regulatory 180s in recent SEC history,\u201d VanEck\u2019s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, told Fortune in a statement. Issuers include BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity and Grayscale, among others.\n\nThe agency\u2019s relative silence over the pending applications in recent months led many in the cryptocurrency industry to regard an approval this year as a pipe dream. Bloomberg analysts were predicting the odds of approval to be as low as 25% as late as Monday afternoon. But then, in a sudden turn of events, on Monday, CoinDesk first reported that the issuers were \u201cabruptly\u201d asked by regulators to update their 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis. Since then, at least eight of the nine issuers have done so\u2014and Bloomberg\u2019s experts raised their projection to 75%. The price of Ether has soared 25% since Monday, trading at $3,855 as of 5:13 p.m. EST.\n\nThe SEC will not be commenting on the order, a spokesperson told Fortune.\n\nThe updates requested by the SEC on Monday remain undisclosed, but Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, told Fortune he knows \u201cfor a fact\u201d that staking will be prohibited. Indeed, Fidelity this week updated its S-1 filing with the staking component omitted.\n\nBut for trading of the financial products to begin, the SEC must next approve the issuers\u2019 S-1 filings. These forms outline to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens. But it\u2019s also understood that the approval of these forms is a case of \u201cwhen not if,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart wrote on X.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t recall anytime there would be S-1s not approved after a 19b-4 approval. I don\u2019t think a precedent exists,\u201d Balchnaus added. He estimates the forms will take about two weeks to be approved, as he expects there to be only one round of comments from the SEC. That\u2019s because the spot Bitcoin ETFs already did a lot of the \u201ctrailblazing,\u201d so in this case, the applications will require minor \u201cfine-tuning.\u201d In the case of Bitcoin ETFs, each round of comments required two weeks to complete.\n\n\u201cAt Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to engage constructively with regulators as they review spot Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential of bringing Ethereum further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter in the ETF wrapper,\u201d a Grayscale spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThis is a \u201ckey step\u201d to offering U.S. investors \u201ceasier access, higher protection, and safeguards,\u201d an Invesco spokesperson said.\n\n\u2018A legitimate voting block\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s the question erupting throughout crypto: Why did the SEC change its tune? Experts told Fortune it was likely a political, top-down order. The approval on Thursday is \u201cproof that the crypto crowd is a legitimate voting block,\u201d says VanEck\u2019s Sigel.\n\nA bipartisan group of crypto-friendly House lawmakers urged the SEC and Chairman Gary Gensler to approve the ETFs in a letter on Wednesday. \u201cThe current digital asset regulatory landscape presents various risks to consumers, investors, and market participants,\u201d they wrote. An approval would offer investors access to crypto in a safer, more transparent and regulated format, they argued.\n\nAdmittedly, although the letter is unlikely to have tipped the scale, it does add to a building consensus in Washington that the elusive crypto vote may have weight.\n\n\u201cPolitics is powerful, and especially in an election year. What we\u2019ve heard inside is that this was politically driven. The Democrats do not want to see Donald Trump and the Republicans win on this issue, and lose votes from single-issue voters,\u201d says Balchunas.\n\nA survey published this week by the Federal Reserve reveals that just 1% of Americans used crypto to buy something in 2023, but in a razor-thin election, with Trump polling just 1% ahead of President Joe Biden, even 100,000 votes or so could make the difference.\n\n\u2018Very gratifying\u2019\n\nAs a result, the crypto community appears to be a growing priority in Washington, D.C. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a landmark piece of regulation that would establish a supervisory framework around the \u201cmarket structure.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, outlines the separation of powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as creating rules for pivotal questions such as commingling and custody. While the bill was supported by 208 Republicans, at first it was only favored forward by a handful of stubborn, crypto-friendly Democrats. But over the last month, support accelerated, resulting in 71 Democrats voting in favor, with support also coming from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIt is very gratifying that effective communication by the crypto community changed the politics in Washington to the point that elected Democrat leaders are now voting yes to laws that reverse the regime\u2019s hostile approach to this new asset class,\u201d Sigel says.\n\nFIT21 passing through the House flew in the face of Gensler\u2019s attempts to warn Democrats off it. \u201c[FIT21] would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,\u201d Gensler said in the statement released Wednesday.\n\nMoreover, over the past month Trump has also doubled down on his pro-crypto stance. On Tuesday, his presidential campaign said it would start to accept donations via any crypto asset accepted through Coinbase. \u201cBiden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an \u2018anti-crypto army\u2019 to restrict Americans\u2019 right to make their own financial choices,\u201d the campaign said in the announcement, in reference to a reelection ad Warren posted on X last year. \u201cMAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!\u201d"

        "title": "MIT Brothers Charged With Exploiting Ethereum to Steal $25 Million - Dark Reading",
        "content": "Many cryptocurrency traders play fast and loose with the systems in place to empower decentralized finance (DeFi), using a variety of hacks to gain an advantage in their trades \u2014 from sandwich attacks to rug pull scams \u2014 and losses typically run into the tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nYet, two traders \u2014 brothers who both graduated from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology \u2014 took their scheme too far, exploiting a vulnerability in a common component used by traders on the Etherium blockchain to score nearly $25 million in an attack that lasted 12 seconds, the US Department of Justice charged on May 16. The two brothers \u2014 Anton Peraire-Bueno of Boston and James Peraire-Bueno of New York \u2014 discovered the software flaw in 2022, prepared and planned the attacks for months, and then executed the theft in April 2023, law enforcement alleges.\n\nThe attack worried traders and technologists, calling \"the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" Damian Williams, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement from the Justice Department announcing the indictment.\n\n\"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,\" he said. \"And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete. This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged.\"\n\nCryptocurrency has gained legitimacy over the past decade and a half, but continues to \u2014 in many ways \u2014 be a Wild West. In 2023, more than $24 billion in transactions ended up in illicit cryptocurrency wallets or addresses \u2014 although more than half of the total belonged to sanctioned organizations and nations, and the total rate of fraud is only 0.34%, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain intelligence firm.\n\nWhile ransomware gangs prefer Bitcoin, Ethereum has seen its fair share of attacks, from the $60 million DAO hack in 2016 that led to a hard fork \u2014 a rewriting of the Ethereum ledger \u2014 to the more than $600 million in Ethereum stolen from game players on the Ronin Network.\n\nIn many ways, the ecosystem behind cryptocurrencies is undergoing the growing pains that the Internet faced over the past three decades, says Oded Vanunu, chief technologist for Web 3.0 and head of product vulnerability research at cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies.\n\n\"It's crazy, because we are seeing tactics that are being done already in Web 2 platforms that are taking a different shape in the Web 3 protocols,\" he says.\n\nOf Mempools and Maximal Extractable Value\n\nCryptocurrency transfers, the proposal of a smart contract, and the execution of smart contracts are all transactions that are recorded on the blockchain \u2014 in Ethereum's case, a public distributed state machine. However, before being recorded, every transaction is placed in a memory pool, or mempool, pending its validation and execution, which typically takes a few steps.\n\nA participant in the ecosystem known as a \"block builder\" will create a bundle \u2014 or block \u2014 of transactions and get paid by the originator of each transaction for completion, while a \"block proposer\" chooses blocks based on the fees advertised by the builder, validates them, and sends those transactions to its peers on the blockchain network. Typically, a builder is attempting to structure blocks based on a strategy of maximal extractable value (MEV), seeking to maximize profits.\n\nDividing participants into proposers and builders \u2014 what's called a proposer-builder separation (PBS) \u2014 splits the responsibility of validating transactions to limit the monopolization of the process by large traders who could order transactions in specific ways to drive profits. MEV bots help traders identify and create bundles of transactions that maximize their profits from a transaction.\n\nYet, there is still a lot that traders can do to tilt the playing field. In a sandwich attack, for example, the trader profits from the natural price increases or decreases caused by large cryptocurrency transactions. When a large buy order appears, a builder could place a buy order for the cryptocurrency in front of the order, and a matching sell order after, profiting from the price change caused by the original buy order.\n\nFor many DeFi participants, MEV traders are little better than the equivalent of modern ticket scalpers, but they do serve a critical role, says Adam Hart, product manager at Chainalysis.\n\n\"To many, MEV strategies look like hyper-sophisticated, deep-pocketed traders using their resources to profit by forcing less sophisticated traders to take worse prices,\" he says. \"However, others argue that MEV is inevitable in an open, transparent blockchain network, and that MEV traders play a positive role by ensuring that arbitrage opportunities are exploited quickly so that asset prices remain aligned across protocols.\"\n\nAn Attack on MEV Traders\n\nThe Peraire-Bueno brothers discovered a vulnerability in an open source component of a common tool, known as a MEV-Boost relay, according to a postmortem analysis of the incident. MEV-Boost is a protocol for limiting the centralization of the two components of the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 proposers and builders \u2014 and the monopolization of profits, which historically could have resulted in a few players dominating the blockchain process.\n\nA key criteria of the MEV-Boost protocol is that the proposer commits to validating a block based on price, before knowing its contents. The brothers allegedly found that signing the header gave them the information in the block, even if the signature was invalid, the postmortem stated.\n\n\"The attack ... was possible because the exploited relay revealed block bodies to the proposer, so long as the proposer correctly signed a block header,\" the analysis stated. \"However, the relay did not check if the block header that was signed was valid.\"\n\nWhile the vulnerability could have continued to cause problems for traders, this was not an attack on the Ethereum network or its validators directly, but rather on a specific \u2014 albeit, common \u2014 third-party component, says Mario Rivas, blockchain security global practice lead at NCC Group.\n\n\"The attack exploited a vulnerability in the relay's code, which caused the relay to send private transactions to the block builder when it signed a block with invalid headers,\" he says. \"This vulnerability was promptly addressed, mitigating the risk of similar attacks unless other vulnerabilities are identified.\"\n\nLaw Enforcement Tallies Up a Win\n\nThe investigation and indictment, however, is a win for the DOJ. US law enforcement is increasingly cracking down on cryptocurrency scams, hacking, and other questionable practices. In August, for example, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged a correctional officer for creating a worthless cryptocurrency and selling it to other members of law enforcement.\n\nYet, other attacks have remained below the threshold for legal action. In a 2021 attack, for example, one trader acknowledged selling a non-liquid token to a rival \u2014 in something referred to as a Salmonella attack \u2014 and making money off his rival's automated system buying the worthless coin, according to a Forbes report.\n\nThe alleged attack by the two brothers stands apart from those contentious tactics, says Check Point's Vanunu.\n\n\"In essence, while both types of attacks are harmful, the MIT brothers' actions were explicitly illegal due to their direct and unauthorized exploitation of vulnerabilities to steal funds, whereas [a] Salmonella attack leverage[s] market manipulation and deception, staying within the murkier boundaries of legality in the crypto world,\" he says.\n\nThe investigation of the scheme and subsequent indictment underscores that government officials and their private partners are keeping pace with the latest innovative attacks. Despite the sophistication of the exploit and laundering of the proceeds, the investigators traced the funds, identified two suspects, and made their arrests, Chainalysis' Hart says.\n\n\"The Peraire-Bueno brothers' exploit is an incredibly innovative, technically sophisticated attack, and it represents the first time a bad actor has managed to abuse the MEV system widely used by Ethereum block builders in this way and to this degree,\" he says. \"That\u2019s what makes this indictment so impressive, and a promising sign for the future in the fight against cryptocurrency-based crime.\""

        "title": "SEC paves way for ethereum ETFs in boost for crypto - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has paved the way for the potential launch of eight exchange traded funds tied to the world\u2019s second-largest digital coin, following the regulator\u2019s approval of the first bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThe regulator on Thursday approved rule changes in support of ETFs that invest in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain, for several groups including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and Ark Invest. A second round of approvals will be needed before the products can launch.\n\nWidespread anticipation of the approvals has sent ether\u2019s price soaring more than 20 per cent since Monday and more than 60 per cent year-to-date.\n\nIt is a significant regulatory shift for the SEC after months of silence on the issue. On Monday the SEC suddenly gave feedback to issuers and exchanges on the pending applications, sparking a flurry of paperwork and revisions. The SEC had faced deadlines of Thursday and Friday to respond to ether ETF applications from VanEck and Ark, respectively, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cThis is a key step to offering Ethereum access through the ETF structure, which will offer US investors easier access, higher protection and safeguards,\u201d Invesco and Galaxy, a digital assets group, said in a statement on Thursday evening. \u201cWe hope this approval indicates a willingness by the SEC to approve the launch of these products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most of us were resigned to a disapproval order coming down the pike,\u201d said Katherine Dowling, general counsel for Bitwise Asset Management, one of 11 US bitcoin ETF issuers and which has filed to launch an ether ETF.\n\nIt is unclear if and when the SEC will grant the second round of approvals needed before the products can launch.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler on Thursday morning explained his reticence to allowing crypto investment products to launch on the US market at an Investment Company Institute conference. He alluded to the myriad fraud cases that have affected the crypto industry, such as that of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who in March was sentenced to 25 years in prison in connection with the billions of dollars that went missing from his cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to the rampant non-compliance with US law,\u201d Gensler told ICI chief executive Eric Pan. \u201cIt comes down to the frauds and scams. This is a field where some of the leading lights of the field are either now in jail, awaiting jail, awaiting extradition.\u201d\n\nThe SEC last year lost a court battle with Grayscale Investments over the asset manager\u2019s push to convert its flagship bitcoin trust into an ETF. After that decision, the regulator \u2014 with apparent reluctance \u2014 approved Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin product and 10 other new ETF launches earlier this year."

        "content": "The Ethereum ETF still awaits SEC's S-1 filing approval.\n\nShare this article\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF has been listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) with the ticker symbol $ETHA. The listing follows the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of eight spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF on DTCC\n\nThe SEC filings list eight Ethereum ETFs from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Invesco & Galaxy, and BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust, proposed for listing on Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and the Cboe BZX Exchange, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nAlthough the SEC has approved the 19b-4 forms associated with these ETFs, trading will remain on hold until the SEC approves each ETF\u2019s S-1 filing. The timeline for this approval process varies, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to several months.\n\n\u201cThis does not mean they will begin trading tomorrow. This is just 19b-4 approval. Also needs to be an approval on the S-1 documents which is going to take time. We\u2019re expecting it to take a couple weeks but could take longer,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared.\n\nThe SEC has reportedly begun discussions with ETF issuers regarding S-1 forms. Seyffart suggests that the SEC\u2019s approval of the S-1 filings could take up to five months, after which trading of the spot Ethereum ETFs can commence.\n\n\u201cTypically this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples but [Eric Balchunas] and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated,\u201d he added.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the recent approval.\n\nBriefly after the approval, asset manager VanEck submitted the amended S-1 form to the SEC. The firm also released a 37-second advertisement to celebrate the landmark approval, inviting viewers to \u201cEnter the ether.\u201d"

Base, the L2 that was incubated by dominant U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, took second place with nearly 815,000 addresses.\n\nThe base layer of Ethereum, in contrast, had 2.1 million active addresses.\n\nThe rollup-centric roadmap entails a shift of activity from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its layer 2 networks. \u201cCurrently, users have accounts on L1, ENS names on L1, applications live entirely on L1, etc. All of this is going to have to change,\u201d wrote Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in Oct. 2020. \u201cWe would need to adapt to a world where users have their primary accounts, balances, assets, etc entirely inside an L2.\u201d\n\nThe sustained growth of addresses interacting with layer 2 networks highlight the ongoing improvements in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s scalability, or ability to handle more transactions.\n\nRead More: \u200b\u200bWhy ETH Isn\u2019t Moving Higher After SEC Approves Key Filings for Spot ETFs\n\nThe number of distinct addresses on Ethereum L2s hit the new record high before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the 19b-4s filings of several spot ether exchange-traded funds yesterday. While the move is a step closer to the rollout of ETFs directly investing in ETH, the native gas token for the Ethereum blockchain, trading of spot ETH ETFs still awaits a further SEC approval.\n\nThe SEC has to approve S-1 forms, registration documents needed for a firm to offer shares of an ETF to the public.\n\nThe price of ETH has rallied about 20% in the past seven days but has decreased 2.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3,720 at the time of writing, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Remains Flat Following Historic Spot ETF Approval\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced relatively minor price movements, gaining 0.80% over the past 24 hours, following the surprising approval of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). After the news of the ETF approvals broke, Ethereum's price briefly surged to $3,935, according to CoinMarketCap data, before settling down at $3,794. Although Ethereum has experienced a 28% surge in the last week, it remains 22% below its all-time high of $4,878, reached in November 2021.\n\nThe sudden approval of these ETFs by the SEC represents a momentous decision that paves the way for Ethereum trading to take place on Wall Street. The approved funds include the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK/21 Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe availability of these ETFs allows everyday investors to purchase shares that trade on stock exchanges and track the price movements of Ethereum. This simplifies the process of buying, selling, and storing Ethereum for traditional investors who may find the world of digital coins and tokens daunting. ETFs are widely recognized and regulated investment vehicles that provide an accessible entry point into the crypto space without requiring extensive technical knowledge.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs marks a significant turn of events, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been silent on the matter for several months, leading many industry experts and analysts to anticipate a rejection. In a similar turn of events earlier this year, the SEC reluctantly approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, leading to a surge in the price of the largest cryptocurrency to all-time highs of $73,750."

        "content": "Mounting excitement around the approval of spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) comes with a caveat: the issuers will likely not offer staking as part of the ETF, which could be beneficial to ETF stakers and Ethereum overall.\n\nRead more: ETH ETFs Will Be Approved. But Could Grayscale Outflows Depress the Price of ETH?\n\nETF applicants like Fidelity and BlackRock have decided to exclude staking in their filings, implying what the industry already sensed: the SEC is not willing to allow ETF issuers to include staking in their products.\n\nMatt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise (which will issue an ETH spot ETF), said on Unchained that he would have expected the SEC to go this route. \u201cThe first shot on goal will be let\u2019s get to 90%, which is without staking and then let\u2019s worry about the complications later and down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: After ETH, Which Crypto ETF Will Be Approved Next?\n\nETFs With No Staking Mean More Returns for Stakers\n\nWith the likely exclusion of staking from ETH ETFs, investors who buy these ETFs will miss out on staking rewards, currently around 3% APY, depending on the provider, per Staking Rewards data. These rewards, instead, will go to those who stake their ETH directly or with staking services such as Lido or Rocket Pool.\n\nRead more: Could the SEC Have a Case Against Liquid Staking Protocols?\n\nThis setup would amount to a transfer of value from non-staking ETF holders to direct stakers. Staking rewards are a significant component of the potential returns from holding ETH, and by not participating in staking, ETF investors are effectively being diluted, as is every holder of vanilla ETH. This value transfer benefits those who engage in staking, enhancing their returns at the expense of non-stakers.\n\nFidelity is the only ETF issuer that has so far clearly stated in its filing that \u201cNeither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Custodian, nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust\u2019s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings.\u201d However, it is expected that none of the issuers will engage in such activities given the regulatory uncertainty.\n\nIf they did, they would have \u201cthe most profitable ETF in the world to run,\u201d according to Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal.\n\nRead more: \u200b\u200bWhy ETH Isn\u2019t Moving Higher After SEC Approves Key Filings for Spot ETFs\n\nETFs Could Mitigate Staking Ratio Concerns\n\nThe exclusion of staking from these ETFs could also alleviate a growing concern in the Ethereum community about the rapidly increasing ratio of staked ETH. High staking ratios have raised fears of centralization and reduced liquidity. By not incorporating staking, these ETFs will likely help maintain a more balanced ratio of staked to non-staked ETH by sucking up ETH liquidity.\n\nAs Ethereum researchers have pointed out\n\n, a high staking ratio can lead to centralization risks and inflationary pressures on non-stakers. Because the ETFs will effectively lock up large sums of ETH that are not staked, they may help mitigate these risks, ensuring a healthier balance within the network and addressing community apprehensions about an excessive amount of ETH being locked in staking contracts.\n\nRead more: Why the Ethereum Community Is Up in Arms Against a Proposal to Change the Monetary Policy\n\nHowever, this will depend on the SEC never approving staking to be offered as a part of spot ETH ETFs. Given the fast-moving nature of crypto politics in Washington, that\u2019s difficult to predict with any confidence."

That process could take several weeks.\n\nThis is a win for the crypto industry, which has been hoping for the approval of ether ETFs since a similar product for bitcoin was approved at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday approved applications for the listing of eight spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, though further approvals are necessary before you can start trading them.\n\n\n\nWhen Will Ether ETFs Begin Trading?\n\nAccording to a memo from the regulator, NYSE Arca has been authorized to list the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF; Nasdaq will list the iShares Ethereum Trust; and CBOE BZX will list the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and the Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nVanEck immediately followed the SEC's announcement with an S-1 filing, indicating that their product was ready to launch. The S-1 approval process, in which regulators will look at the specific ETFs themselves, could take weeks but some analysts say that process may be fast-tracked.\n\nSEC Comes Around Despite Concerns\n\nConcerns around whether ether is a security and staking were two major reasons why the SEC was reluctant to give a green light to ether ETFs. While many market participants say today's decision indirectly implies ether is not a security, the issues around staking were resolved when ETF issuers removed it from their applications.\n\nSome analysts said the White House's softened stance on crypto helped move the SEC toward approval. Additionally, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged the SEC to approve the ETFs in a letter to the regulators.\n\nSince the January approval of spot bitcoin (BTC), markets have closely watched the approval process for similar funds for the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. That has created a runup in the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is up 60% year-to-date. Ether was up almost 2% on the day as the SEC made its announcement.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct number of spot Ether ETFs that have been approved for listing."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, a cryptocurrency linked to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is marching past its previous all-time highs\u2014and the CEO of a BlackRock-backed RWA firm tells Decrypt that the approval is bullish for the premise of tokenizing assets on Ethereum.\n\nOndo Finance\u2019s governance token has surged 16% to $1.10 over the past 24 hours\u2014leading the crypto market\u2019s top 100 coins by market cap in terms of daily gains, as of this writing, per CoinGecko.\n\nThe project specializes in offering institutional-grade financial products and services, such as tokens offering U.S. dollar yield or exposure to U.S. Treasuries. In 2022, Pantera Capital and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund led a $20 million Series A funding round in the project.\n\nApparently affirming Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status as a commodity, the approval of several spot ETFs has massive consequences for firms focused on building digital representations of assets that trade on-chain and via associated infrastructure, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe most important thing here is not that you can trade an Ethereum ETF,\u201d he said of Thursday\u2019s approvals. \u201cEthereum, at least from an institutional perspective, is [now] completely safe to use because there\u2019s no risk that the gas token, ETH in this case, is actually a security.\u201d\n\nIn March, Ondo said it would move $95 million worth of funds backing its U.S. Treasury-backed token (OUSG) to BlackRock\u2019s tokenized BUIDL fund. Established through Securitize, shares of BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund are represented by an Ethereum-based token, pegged to the price of $1, and subscribers of the fund receive a yield through the form of more tokens.\n\nFun fact of the day\ud83d\udc47$ONDO alone has contributed $195M of BUIDL's $448M AUM. To put this into perspective.. Blackrock's first onchain fund, has seen nearly 50% of its growth come from Ondo's efforts. There's levels to this and your size isn't size. \u2014 JTrades\u2694\ufe0f (@_JTrades_) May 24, 2024\n\nOndo\u2019s shift to BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund was all about efficiency, Domingo said. The CEO explained that previously, while backing its OUSG token with BlackRock's iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, managing the product was comparatively clunky.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey didn't have good control over the underlying asset in terms of fast issuance, fast redemption, [and] on chain visibility\u2014that the money's there,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cOne of the use cases for BUIDL is that it becomes a base layer for people to build products on top of it.\u201d\n\nOndo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has highlighted tokenization as the \u201cnext generation for markets\u201d since 2022, believing that crypto tech could provide financial market participants \u201creduced fees\u201d and \u201cinstantaneous settlement.\u201d\n\nDescribing Ondo as \u201cvery innovative,\u201d Domingo said Ondo\u2019s use of BUIDL collapses five distinct steps\u2014between broker-dealers and custodians that safeguard assets\u2014in the redemption of Ondo\u2019s products. Before, he said, it would take them \u201ctwo or three days to get the money.\u201d\n\nIn light of the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, Domingo said he expects more staid financial firms to branch into the tokenization space with a cloud of regulatory jitters recently dispelled.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, [this] is more relevant for tokenization than the Bitcoin ETF,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I mentioned, it makes very clear that [Ethereum is] not a commodity, and therefore, using the public Ethereum blockchain is safe from a regulatory perspective.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Fish specifically called out connections to EigenLayer, a protocol for re-staking Ether to secure Ethereum layer 2 blockchains, which now holds $18.1 billion in TVL, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nDays later, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake confirmed that he\u2019d established a multimillion-dollar advisory relationship with EigenLayer, for which he\u2019s received \u201ca significant EIGEN token incentive\u201d worth millions of dollars, comprising close to half of his net worth.\n\nFellow researcher Dankrad Feist also confirmed a similar relationship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnline critics have worried that accepting money from EigenLayer could influence the experts\u2019 analyses of re-staking risks (which trended cautious) or possibly influence his work on the core Ethereum protocol.\n\nIs an Ethereum core dev working for EigenLayer the same thing as the US Secretary of Defense working for the largest private defense company? Is that acceptable? Genuinely asking what the best analogy is here. \u2014 Quinn Thompson (@qthomp) May 19, 2024\n\n\u201c[The Ethereum Foundation] are some of the highest integrity people I know and I don't see the 1% of [members] formally involved with EigenLayer compromising their morals,\u201d Drake argued last week. To his knowledge, he said that three of 300 people at the Ethereum Foundation are formally involved with EigenLayer.\n\nFeist also said his token allocation won\u2019t \u201cchange or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin said he wouldn\u2019t \u201crestrict anybody in the Ethereum Foundation or in the ecosystem from supporting more projects.\u201d\n\nLubin noted that his own company, a leading Ethereum wallet infrastructure provider, has had many of its members move on to other ecosystem projects for financial compensation. Consensys is fine with such relationships, he said, so long as they are disclosed and there is no conflict of interest regarding Consensys-related decisions.

        "title": "Is Ethereum a security or commodity? Why does it matter and will an ETF change this? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The ongoing debate over Ethereum\u2019s classification in the United States is garnering significant attention at the moment due to actions by the SEC and a possible ETF approval. The distinction between commodities and securities holds substantial implications for the regulation and future of crypto. If Ethereum were officially recognized as a commodity, the crypto landscape could witness transformative shifts in regulatory oversight, market participation, and investment vehicles.\n\nCommodity vs security definitions\n\nIn the US, a commodity is generally defined as a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. This category includes items like gold, oil, and agricultural products. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates commodities, focusing on market stability and fraud prevention. Conversely, a security represents an ownership position in a publicly traded corporation via stock, a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation via bond, or rights to ownership as represented by an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities, emphasizing investor protection and disclosure requirements.\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification has been a contentious issue. In 2018, the CFTC asserted jurisdiction over Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, classifying them as commodities. The SEC, however, has historically been more cautious. In 2018, SEC Director William Hinman suggested that Ethereum, which had initially been funded through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), might not be a security due to its decentralized nature. Despite this, the lack of a definitive classification has left Ethereum in a regulatory gray area.\n\nHow would classifying Ethereum a commodity change things?\n\nThe potential recognition of Ethereum as a commodity would have several implications. Firstly, it would place Ethereum under the purview of the CFTC, which could lead to more consistent regulatory guidelines. This shift could reduce the regulatory uncertainty that currently hampers some institutional investors, thereby encouraging broader participation in the Ethereum market. Moreover, it could pave the way for new financial products, such as Ethereum futures and options, thereby enhancing market liquidity and stability.\n\nA significant development that could influence Ethereum\u2019s classification is the approval of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. They hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and typically operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur. In the context of Ethereum, an ETF would provide a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors alike. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US has already set a precedent as it is designated a commodity ETF.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF could bolster arguments for its classification as a commodity. The successful launch of a Bitcoin ETF has demonstrated to regulators that digital assets can be integrated into traditional financial systems in a regulated and secure manner. An Ethereum ETF would likely undergo rigorous scrutiny, ensuring that all compliance and security measures are in place. This process could further validate Ethereum\u2019s status as a commodity by showcasing its stability and maturity as an asset class.\n\nRecognizing Ethereum as a commodity would not only clarify its regulatory status but also enhance its appeal to a broader range of investors. Institutional interest in crypto is growing, driven by the desire for portfolio diversification and hedging against inflation. Clear regulatory guidelines would mitigate the risks associated with regulatory uncertainty, making Ethereum a more attractive investment.\n\nAdditionally, this recognition could spur innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. With regulatory clarity, developers and businesses could engage in more ambitious projects without the fear of unexpected legal repercussions. This could accelerate the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader digital economy.\n\nUltimately, the official recognition of Ethereum as a commodity would mark a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It would streamline regulatory oversight, enhance market participation, and foster innovation. The potential approval of an Ethereum ETF could play a crucial role in this process, demonstrating Ethereum\u2019s viability as a stable and mature asset. However, it would not be an official settle the debate regarding Ethereum being a commodity unless additional specific classifications were issued by the SEC."

        "content": "Numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a boon for the market. The first day of trading in the US saw over $4.6 billion in volume. Within a month, bitcoin rose above $50,000 for the first time since the bear market and hit $70,000 in March for the first time ever.\n\nBut this bitcoin ETF liquidity boost does not address any of the underlying issues in today\u2019s crypto user experience, nor does it offer investors empowerment through self-custody.\n\nIn the case of ethereum ETFs, the outcome will likely be the same. Rather than rely on regulatory approval of such financial products to welcome traditional investors onboard, our industry needs to reimagine how we approach digital asset management so that users don\u2019t need to choose between convenience and financial freedom.\n\nWhat interest in ETFs really tell us\n\nThe appeal of ETFs is exposure to the crypto market without the hassle of digital asset custody. With over 900,000 ETH forever lost due to user error, it\u2019s understandable that investors would look for easier ways to tap into the value created in this space.\n\nBut using old-world instruments to address crypto\u2019s user experience challenges goes against what this industry set out to do \u2014 transform existing financial infrastructure to empower the little guy.\n\nAfter years of being looked down on by Wall Street, ETFs are tacit acknowledgments by traditional investors that the crypto sector is something worth opening the floodgates of retail and non-crypto money into. Supposing that ethereum ETF approval generates further interest in the crypto space \u2014 be that bullish interest from Larry Fink at BlackRock, opposition from ECB director generals, or just curiosity from the trainer at my local gym \u2014 the opportunity lies in shepherding these new investors toward full ownership of their assets.\n\nThe ETF wrapper is one means of entry into crypto as an asset, but removing the wrapper brings us to the real treat \u2014 true ownership.\n\nNewfound industry attention, now to trust ourselves\n\nWhy should individuals care about self-custody and financial freedom? While the answer may be obvious to those deeply embedded in the crypto community, trusting traditional banks is the norm, and the convenience brought by these institutions outweighs the risks of crypto for many individuals.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin white paper was published 15 years ago, the manifesto envisioned a peer-to-peer network without financial intermediaries. Ethereum then brought new functionality to the digital asset space and created the foundation for DeFi innovation. For the first time, individuals could harness digital ownership and exchange assets globally online while preserving personal privacy and autonomy.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: BlackRock and other bitcoin ETFs rob bitcoin of its room to grow\n\nThe challenge now is to get people of all investment experience and levels involved directly through self-custody of their assets. Products like ETFs, which mirror instruments in the traditional finance space, may have a positive market impact. However, they do not push individuals to reconsider traditional financial hierarchies and take ownership into their own hands. Only by directly engaging in self-custody platforms will we see crypto values influence mainstream audiences.\n\nWe\u2019re only as good as our infrastructure\n\nSelf-custody is important, but how are we going to convince the next billion users to value freedom over convenience? It\u2019s obvious that seed phrases and hardware wallets are not going to unlock digital ownership for mainstream users. In a time where payments can be made with a tap of a phone or a watch, the crypto industry needs usable features to appeal to traditional investors and everyday users.\n\nThat\u2019s why Vitalik and other leaders in the Ethereum space are calling for a transition to smart accounts. By abstracting away the complexities of digital asset management, smart accounts enable features like crypto recovery, self-custodial debit cards and email login. In addition to smart accounts, improvements in scaling tools like zero-knowledge (zk) rollups have increased the capacity and throughput of DeFi applications, overcoming bottlenecks and preparing the industry for mainstream adoption.\n\nBetter features and scalability have paved the way for new use cases in crypto. Self-custody is no longer limited to individual asset management. With multi-signature accounts, for example, organizations and businesses can co-manage assets with ease. Further, developments in zk have reduced transaction fees, making it feasible for projects to facilitate large batches of transactions cost-effectively.\n\nThe crypto industry needs to continue building momentum\n\nBitcoin and ethereum ETFs have captured the zeitgeist, and now the crypto industry needs to capitalize on the mindshare introduced by this regulatory milestone. In the same way that football\u2019s popularity grew in my German hometown in the aftermath of Germany\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup victory, this newfound interest among conventional investors allows us to push self-custody to the forefront and showcase the opportunities unlocked by digital ownership.\n\nETFs encourage adoption; true crypto ownership encourages autonomy. Simplifying crypto user experience should be championed above simple ETF wrappers and commodity baskets. Bolstered with new liquidity, the industry needs to use this pivotal moment as a catalyst to revamp user experience across the board.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Approved in Abrupt SEC Policy About-Face - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn a stunning reversal, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Thursday that it has approved eight applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, effectively green-lighting Ethereum trading on Wall Street.\n\nThe following funds were approved in the filing: the converted Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK/21 Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nWhen will the spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading? It won't be tomorrow. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart suggested in a tweet that it could be a \"couple weeks\" before the fund managers' S-1 documents are approved to enable trading.\n\nGoing to add here. Typically this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples but @EricBalchunas and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated. #Bitcoin ETFs were at least 90 days. Will know more soon. \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 23, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust one week ago, most financial experts and crypto industry leaders had written off such an outcome as increasingly unlikely. For one, the SEC had offered little indication that it planned to move forward with any spot ETH ETF applications prior to a looming May 23 deadline.\n\nWhat's more, just weeks prior, a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC alleged that the regulator has secretly considered ETH to be an illegal, unregistered security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) If the SEC formally labeled ETH a security, then Ethereum ETFs would need to be approved via a different process than the one currently underway.\n\nThus, in approving spot ETH ETFs today, the SEC has tacitly conceded that ETH is not a security in and of itself. Such an outcome is a major victory for crypto advocates, given ETH\u2019s crucial role in underpinning the Ethereum network\u2014upon which many of the industry\u2019s most prominent projects and services are built.\n\nCrucially, however\u2014in a bid to get over the finish line\u2014several ETH ETF issuers dropped language from their applications this week regarding the staking of customer ETH. Ever since Ethereum transitioned to a proof of stake system in September 2022, ETH holders have been able to deposit their funds with the network to accrue rewards. The SEC has long taken the view that when a financial intermediary offers staking services, it is engaging in an illegally unregistered securities scheme.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs\u2014unlike ETH futures ETFs, which track derivatives contracts and were approved by the SEC in October\u2014involve issuers actually buying and storing ETH on behalf of their clients. Now that spot ETH ETFs have gained approval, traditional financial institutions and investors will soon be able to gain exposure to ETH without holding any crypto themselves.\n\nToday\u2019s historic action follows the SEC\u2019s approval of eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications in January. Since then, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $13 billion in net in-flows.\n\n\u201cI always called the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, Bitcoin\u2019s IPO,\u201d Cody Carbone, chief policy officer at the crypto lobbying group Digital Chamber of Commerce told Decrypt. \u201cThis is ETH\u2019s IPO. That is a massive stamp of approval.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details."

        "content": "Ethereum drops nearly 5% in an hour, suspected MEV manipulation by Symbolic Capital Partners.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum (ETH) faced a nearly 5% crash in one hour this Thursday, despite the anticipation around the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. The X user identified as ai_9684xtpa pointed out that this was likely a market manipulation movement by the trading firm Symbolic Capital Partners.\n\n\u201cThe agency sold 6,968 ETH in one minute at 20:56, worth $27.38 million, with an average selling price of $3,930; one transaction sold 3,497 ETH on the chain at one time, and the bribe cost was as high as 90 ETH,\u201d explained ai_9684xtpa.\n\nSuch transactions are known as MEV, short for \u201cmaximal extractable value,\u201d which consists of using on-chain resources to profit. The payment of 90 ETH suggests a hurry to sell the position at a higher price to make it crash, possibly to buy it again at a lower price.\n\nETH price fluctuation after Symbolic\u2019s transaction. Image: CoinGecko\n\nSince the crash, Ethereum has ranged in and out of the $3,800 price level and is priced at $3,803.37 at the time of writing, nearly 22% away from its previous all-time high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening\u201d\n\nAs shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, an approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is happening this Thursday. Despite the low odds given to this scenario until last Monday, Seyffart and his fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas boosted the chances to 75% after the SEC started contacting the issuers.\n\nSince then, various asset management firms presented amends to their 19b-4 filings, and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF even got listed on DTCC under the ticker $ETHV. The first final deadline is today, as the US regulator must decide on VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nMoreover, according to Balchunas, the SEC\u2019s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs might come at 4 pm (EST). Although a positive outcome is expected, it doesn\u2019t mean immediate permission for trading."

        "title": "Why staking was removed from Ethereum ETFs to get SEC approval - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The removal of staking from Ethereum ETFs has been driven by regulatory pressures from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issuers amended their ETF filings to exclude staking provisions prior to the approvals on May 23. This strategic shift aims to align with the SEC\u2019s regulatory expectations to allow the approval for their Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIs staked ETH a security?\n\nStaking, which involves locking up crypto to validate transactions in exchange for rewards, is a significant feature of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. However, the SEC views staking services as potentially constituting unregistered securities offerings. This perspective has led to actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services and alleging violations of federal securities laws. Consequently, ETF issuers removed staking from their proposals to avoid similar legal challenges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s classification of staked ETH as a security hinges on applying the Howey Test, which determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract. According to the SEC, staking involves investing money when users lock up their ETH in exchange for potential returns, satisfying the first prong of the Howey Test. The second prong, a joint enterprise, is met as stakers contribute to a shared ecosystem and rely on the collective efforts of network validators and developers to secure and maintain the network. The third prong, the expectation of profits, is fulfilled as stakers anticipate rewards in additional tokens. Finally, the SEC argues that these profits are derived primarily from the efforts of others, such as the validators and developers who ensure the network\u2019s functionality and security. This interpretation aligns staking with the characteristics of an investment contract, thereby subjecting it to securities regulations.\n\nWhy staked ETH is not a security\n\nOpponents contend that staking should not be classified as a security because it fundamentally differs from traditional investment contracts. Staking involves locking up tokens to support network operations and earn rewards, which is more akin to a technical service than an investment scheme. The rewards from staking are derived from the network\u2019s protocol and market conditions, not from the managerial efforts of a third party, which challenges the application of the Howey Test\u2019s \u201cefforts of others\u201d prong.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s enforcement actions against staking services, such as those involving Kraken and Coinbase, have been criticized for lacking clear guidance and creating a climate of regulatory uncertainty. Critics argue that the SEC\u2019s reliance on enforcement rather than providing explicit regulatory frameworks leaves crypto firms and investors in a precarious position, unsure of how to comply with the law. This approach is considered inefficient and unfair, particularly in an emerging industry that requires clear and consistent regulations to foster growth and innovation.\n\nMoreover, the decentralized nature of many staking activities complicates the SEC\u2019s assertion that stakers primarily rely on the efforts of others. In decentralized networks, validators and stakers operate independently, and the network\u2019s security and functionality are maintained through a collective effort rather than centralized management. This decentralization challenges the notion that staking constitutes a joint enterprise under the Howey Test.\n\nAdditionally, critics argue that the SEC\u2019s actions could drive staking activities offshore, reducing the United States\u2019 influence in the global crypto market and potentially compromising investor protection. By pushing staking services to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations, the SEC may inadvertently encourage less oversight and more significant risks for US investors.\n\nFinally, the SEC\u2019s stance may hinder blockchain technology\u2019s broader adoption and development. Staking is a crucial component of proof-of-stake networks, designed to be more energy-efficient than their proof-of-work counterparts. By imposing stringent regulations on staking, the SEC could limit the potential benefits of DeFi and other blockchain-based innovations.\n\nStaked ETH and Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval process for Ethereum ETFs involves submitting 19b-4 forms for listing on exchanges and S-1 forms detailing fund management. While the SEC has approved the 19b-4 forms, the S-1 forms are still under review. The exclusion of staking from these filings is necessary to meet the SEC\u2019s regulatory requirements and facilitate the approval process.\n\nThe removal of staking from Ethereum ETFs has sparked debate within the crypto community. Many investors highly value staking for the yield it generates, and its absence in Ethereum ETFs could significantly diminish its attractiveness compared to direct purchases of Ethereum, where invhttp://stakingestors can engage in staking activities. Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at GSR, highlighted the \u201cimmediate opportunity cost\u201d of holding Ether in an ETF that does not offer staking.\n\nDespite these concerns, the potential benefits of the Ethereum blockchain remain a topic of interest. Eliminating staking from ETFs could lead to broader implications for supply, network security, and decentralization due to less staked ETH.\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is considering allowing staking for Ethereum ETFs. This approach aims to enhance the attractiveness of these ETFs by offering passive income opportunities through staking, potentially boosting investor interest and supporting Hong Kong\u2019s ambitions to become a global crypto hub.\n\nUltimately, the removal of staking from Ethereum ETFs directly responds to the SEC\u2019s regulatory concerns and legal actions against staking services. This strategic adjustment by ETF issuers aims to align with regulatory expectations and get approval despite potentially reducing the attractiveness of these ETFs compared to direct Ethereum investments.\n\nWill staking be enabled further down the line? Time will tell, and all eyes will be on the SEC and its decision to classify Ethereum and staked ETH in the coming weeks and months."

        "content": "As the financial world closely watches the developments around the Ethereum ETH/USD Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), market participants are gearing up for significant price movements.\n\nWhat Happened: According to QCP Asia\u2019s report on May 23, the impending ETH ETF decision has created a buzz, with implied volatility for Friday exceeding 100%, indicating that the market is bracing for substantial fluctuations.\n\nKey players such as BlackRock Inc. BLK and five other issuers have recently amended their ETF filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and VanEck's ETF has already been listed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\nThis has led analysts to believe that an approval is highly likely, with trading expected to commence as early as next week.\n\nMarko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, said, \"If the BTC ETF approval was any indication, we could see a similar 60% rally from here.\"\n\nQCP Asia\u2019s trade idea further supports this optimistic outlook.\n\nThe likelihood of ETH ETF approval under SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2018s tenure appears strong.\n\nBoth Jurina and James Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, note that recent regulatory developments, such as minor requested changes to 19b-4 forms, suggest that approval is imminent.\n\n\"Everyone sees that ETH ETFs will pass very soon,\" said Davies. \"The SEC is following its pre-approval process, asking submitters to make minor changes to their applications, which they would not do if this was clearly not passing.\"\n\nIn the event of a denial, the most probable outcome would be a series of lawsuits, similar to the reaction following the initial rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nApplicants would likely challenge the SEC\u2019s decision in court.\n\nDavies explained, \"If BTC ETF approval story is informative, we will likely get ETH ETF approval as a result of legal challenges.\"\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Notch $154M Inflows As Popular Bitcoiner Slams Ethereum: \u2018A Speculative Platform For Gambling\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: The approval of ETH ETFs holds significant relevance as it would enhance the credibility of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\"ETFs increase the level of credibility of the industry, given that the SEC is giving a stamp of approval,\" noted Jurina.\n\nThis would attract larger funds and institutional investors who have been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties, potentially leading to substantial capital inflows and bolstering Ethereum's market position.\n\nWhile the approval of ETH ETFs could pave the way for other crypto asset ETFs, analysts like Davies believe that Ethereum\u2019s unique status in the industry makes it an outlier.\n\n\"The broader adoption of ETFs for other digital assets would require significant market infrastructure development,\" said Davies.\n\n\"We need to see places to instantly hedge other tokens in a cost-effective manner, with depth, to enable ETF providers to manage risks.\"\n\nIf ETH ETFs are approved, the repercussions for the ETH token price could be substantial.\n\n\"The market is not anticipating a rejection,\" Jurina commented, indicating that political ramifications could also arise if the SEC were to deny the applications at this stage.\n\n\"Household names have filed for ETFs and committed significant capital to their building. If the SEC were to reject at this late stage, it would be a shock and create political repercussions, which it is apparent Biden would not want to see at the present moment.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: For those looking to stay ahead of these developments and gain deeper insights into the future of digital assets, Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will be a crucial gathering.\n\nIndustry leaders and investors will converge to discuss the regulatory landscape, investment strategies, and the evolving digital asset market, providing a comprehensive overview of what lies ahead in this dynamic field.\n\nRead Next: VanEck\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Listed On DTCC As SEC Decision Looms\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "These three megacap tokens are moving higher on the heels of a big potential catalyst.\n\nIt's been a wild ride in the cryptocurrency world this week, but it's mostly been a ride higher for investors in the largest blockchain projects. Bitcoin (BTC -1.37%), Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) and Dogecoin (DOGE -4.66%) have seen some remarkable moves higher over the past week, surging 3.3%, 28.7% and 5% over the past week, as of noon ET on Thursday.\n\nThe story this week that appears to be providing the rising tide lifting the boats of all large-cap digital assets is the expectation that a ruling should be forthcoming this week as to whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nBitcoin went on a run heading into the ultimate approval of spot ETFs for that crypto, and there was a flood of capital into this asset. This is a clear and meaningful catalyst for the overall sector and could lead to other similar products down the line.\n\nLet's dive into each of these tokens and what to watch in the week ahead.\n\nAre spot Ethereum ETFs coming?\n\nSome level of uncertainty remains on the ultimate decision from regulators for both the VanEck spot Ethereum application (due sometime later today) and the ARK 21Shares ETF application due tomorrow. Earlier this week, expectations were that we wouldn't hear anything until next week at the soonest. Accordingly, with the timeline moved up, investors will soon see whether these bullish bets were correct.\n\nPotential capital flow into Ethereum could disrupt inflows into Bitcoin-focused spot ETF funds. Thus, the price action we're seeing with Bitcoin heading into this announcement isn't surprising. Ethereum's gain should (at least somewhat) be Bitcoin's loss, though it's worth noting that Bitcoin has still trended positively on this news, since it's good for the broader sector.\n\nDogecoin's price action appears to be relatively detached from the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. That said, expectations of greater liquidity in this space courtesy of institutional investors have traders ramping up on more-speculative bets to capture the maximum amount of upside today.\n\nWhere to go from here\n\nPersonally, I think the safest place to be right now when it comes to these top digital assets is on the sidelines. Yes, there's some major upside potential should the SEC rule in favor of spot Ethereum ETFs. But I think the downside risk of a \"no\" could outweigh any future gains (and to be sure, a lot has already been priced in).\n\nVarious regulators have displayed different levels of enthusiasm for these spot Ethereum ETF products, so the outcome remains uncertain. Until we have an approval on the books, this is a catalyst I don't think is worth trading on right now."

        "content": "Ethereum Records Largest Daily Gains In 3 Years, Flips Mastercard And LVMH In Market Cap\n\nOn Monday afternoon, news broke that the probability of the SEC at least partially approving a spot ethereum ETF had vastly increased. This immediately led to massive buying activity for ETH, sending the price from less than $3,100 to over $3,800 in 24 hours. This marked the largest daily move for ETH since May 2021.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\nThe move followed a post on X from Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, who has been covering crypto ETFs for several months. The post detailed how he is raising the \"odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they\u2019d be denied).\"\n\nThe post has amassed nearly five million views at the time of writing and was one of the first to start the frenzy surrounding the spot ETH ETFs. The announcement was highly unforeseen, as many had written off the ETFs due to the SEC's lack of comment on the issue and final deadlines for a decision looming later this week.\n\nTrending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\nThis news further enabled ethereum to reach a market cap of over $450 billion, making it larger than all but 20 companies worldwide. Here are some of the companies that ethereum surpassed after the news:\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nLVMH (LVMUY)\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG)\n\nSamsung (KRW)\n\nBank of America (BOA)\n\nHowever, approval of ETFs is not as black and white as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" from the SEC because two forms must be approved for the ETFs to go live. The 19b-4 form allows the funds to list the ETFs, while the S-1 form is a detailed account of how the ETFs would work. According to ETF analyst Nate Geraci, the SEC could greenlight the 19b-4 forms but delay a decision on the S-1s. This would give them time to take a closer look at the individual applications from different sponsors to understand what a launch would look like.\n\nIf this were to happen, it would be a positive for the spot ETFs and ethereum. It would allow the applications to move into the next stage of the process and one step closer to launch. Additionally, the possibility of full approval of the 19b-4s and S-1s is still on the table.\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts believe that a spot ETF approval would propel ETH to a price above $4,000, with some predicting that ETH could set new ATHs above $4,900. Given that Bitcoin hit new highs after the approval of its ETFs, a similar trend could occur for ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum Records Largest Daily Gains In 3 Years, Flips Mastercard And LVMH In Market Cap originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "SEC Changes Ethereum Rule, Sets Stage for ETF Approval - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "SEC Renders Decision on Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday approved a rule change that sets up proposed spot Ethereum ETFs for final approval.\n\nThe SEC must still approve the S-1 registration statements, but observers of the process have said such approvals are generally a formality.\n\nThe announcement on Thursday on the agency's website seemed unlikely barely a week ago and underscores the growing demand for cryptocurrency-based investments.\n\nThe decision affects funds proposed by VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Ark 21 Shares, Grayscale. These new products will be based on the ongoing price of ether the native cryptocurrency of the smart contracts Ethereum blockchain. Existing ether-based ETFs are based on futures contracts.\n\n\"This approval order is based on all of the Exchanges\u2019 representations and descriptions in their respective amended filings, which the Commission has carefully evaluated,\" the SEC said in the filing. \"For the reasons set forth above, including the Commission\u2019s correlation analysis, the Commission finds that the Proposals are consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange\n\nEther fell about 5% since the announcement, to about $3,710 this morning after was recently trading hands at about $3,820 shortly after the SEC statement last night, according to crypto markets data provider CoinMarketCap. The second largest digital asset behind bitcoin in market capitalization has risen more than 30% over the past week with much of the gains coming after the SEC signaled a willingness to approve the rules change. In the days before Thursday's announcement, the agency asked issuers to amend the 19b-4 forms to address concerns about investor protections and regulatory oversight.\n\nThe updated applications have eliminated staking rewards, a high-risk strategy in which investors use ether as collateral to validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nVanEck, Ark 21/Shares September Filings\n\nVanEck and Ark/21 Shares filed their spot Ethereum proposals on Sept. 6. Seven other issuers filed their applications in the ensuring seven months, including Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity, whose slightly more than four-month-old spot bitcoin funds are the largest by assets under management. The 11 spot bitcoin funds have generated about $13 billion in inflows.\n\nDespite the spot bitcoin funds' success, investors and analysts doubted that the SEC would greenlight VanEck's and other spot ether-based funds\u2014at least any time soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe agency had been concerned that spot Ethereum ETFs are vulnerable to market manipulation and fraud, which agency Chairman Gary Gensler has argued plage digital assets, and which presented an obstacle to spot bitcoin approvals. But amid robust demand and shifting political winds that have seen once crypto-shy Democrats join Republicans in support of digital asset-related investments, the SEC seemed to become more receptive to the products based on ether's price.\n\nGrayscale praised the decision in a statement.\n\n\"At Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to engage constructively with regulators as they review spot Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential of bringing Ethereum further into the US regulatory perimeter in the ETF wrapper,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nBut in a note to etf.com, Peter Eberle, president and chief investment officer of Lafayette, Calif.-based digital asset fund manager Castle Funds, wrote that he was \"surprised\" by the SEC decision and was uncertain about investor interest in the products.\n\n\"As a long-term investor in ETH, we stake our ETH, which earns us about 3%,\" he wrote. \"These ETF\u2019s will not be allowed to stake.\"\n\nHe added: \"I also don\u2019t believe that institutional investors need to add ETH to their portfolio since it is highly correlated to BTC. If they allocate 1-3% to crypto, do they really need both BTC and ETH? I am bullish on ETH despite my skepticism of ETH ETFS.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "title": "SEC approves rule change to allow creation of ether ETFs - CNBC",
        "content": "A representation of cryptocurrency Ethereum is placed on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken on June 16, 2023.\n\nThe SEC has approved a rule change Thursday that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether , one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe decision comes less than six months after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved bitcoin ETFs. Those funds have proven to be a big success for the industry, with net inflows already surpassing $12 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nLate May had long been pegged as a potential decision date for the ether funds since it coincided with a deadline for the SEC to decide whether the VanEck Ethereum ETF could proceed.\n\nMany of the companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs \u2014 including BlackRock, Bitwise and Galaxy Digital \u2014 have also started the process of the launching an ether fund.\n\nThe price of ether rose just 2%, although it follows a 20% surge from earlier in the week in anticipation of Thursday's decision. Some investors may also be on pause, as the SEC's rule change approval does not guarantee that all the funds will launch.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC's order approves applications from various exchanges to list eight different ether funds. The order technically does not approve the funds themselves or set a date for the ETFs to begin trading.\n\nEther ETFs are expected to be smaller, at least initially, than their bitcoin counterparts. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently has about $11 billion in assets, much smaller than what the firm's bitcoin fund was before its conversion.\n\nThe approval of the ether ETFs is a sign that the SEC's stance toward crypto may be softening after a series of legal fights. The agency lost a lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023 that spurred the approval for the bitcoin products.\n\nThe SEC's push to regulate crypto has also come under scrutiny by politicians. The Senate last week passed a resolution to withdraw an SEC staff bulletin about accounting rules for digital assets.\n\nEther is the second largest crypto asset and has become something of a blue chip coin along with bitcoin, although its value proposition is distinctly different. While bitcoin is seen primarily as a long-term store of value, an investment in ether is considered more akin to an investment in early stage technology. The ether token fuels the Ethereum network, which powers different applications, like decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or the tokenization of real world assets like commodities, securities, art, real estate and more.\n\nThe applications approved Thursday do not apply to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network, said Richard Kerr, a partner in the law firm K&L Gates.\n\n\"If and when an ether product is approved, it won't mean that a similar product for other digital assets on the Ethereum platform would be approved,\" Kerr said.\n\nEthereum also provides opportunities for staking, which is a way for investors to earn interest on their ether holdings by locking up tokens on the network for a period of time \u2014 although ether ETFs in the U.S. may not participate. The SEC has alleged in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken that staking-as-a-service offerings are unregistered securities. Ark, Fidelity and Grayscale updated their filings this month to remove staking from their proposals.\n\nThe lack of staking in the ETF products is another reason why ether ETFs may see less demand than their bitcoin counterparts, said Steven Lubka, managing director at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Private.\n\n\"These numbers are not going to match the bitcoin ETF inflows, and there are some structural differences in the product that just make it less attractive overall,\" Lubka said."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Decision Recalls Spot Bitcoin Launch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency\n\nRemember the spot bitcoin ETF launch?\n\nAs the spot Ethereum ETF approval drama unfolds, investors and exchange-traded fund industry observers can recall parallels between this case and events leading to the eventual approval and unveiling of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn both cases, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially exhibited caution toward approving spot ETFs for these cryptocurrencies. However, pressure from various stakeholders, including issuers, investors and the maturing crypto market, spurred a potential shift toward approval.\n\nBoth decisions reflect growing recognition of the maturing cryptocurrency market and rapidly increasing institutional interest in these assets.\n\nThe presence of spot bitcoin ETFs and the potential approval of an ether-based ETF suggest the SEC is considering the growing demand from investors for regulated ways to gain exposure to these cryptocurrencies.\n\nA key difference between the two cases is that the Ethereum ETF approval process may be faster than bitcoin's due to the legal precedent set by the August 2023 Grayscale court case, which effectively reversed the SEC\u2019s initial rejection of the asset manager's spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBoth cases highlight the complex path to approval and greater receptivity toward well-structured spot cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nIs a Dogecoin ETF Next?\n\nIn the first two days of trading this week, the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 9% as investors began to speculate that the largest meme coin by market cap could be the next for a spot ETF approval.\n\nCrypto trader Andrew Kang tweeted to his 244,000 followers on X Tuesday, \u201cthe odds for a DOGE ETF look brighter than ever.\u201d\n\nWhile speculation over more spot ETFs is not surprising, it would be surprising if a spot DOGE ETF was next in line.\n\nCryptocurrencies with clear and demonstrably valuable use cases beyond speculation might be viewed more favorably. Additionally, a well-developed ecosystem with robust infrastructure for secure storage and transactions could be a plus. Widespread acceptance, measured by larger market capitalization (total value of all outstanding coins) and higher trading volume (liquidity) may also be considerations.\n\nFor example, there are five cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and ether that have larger market caps than Dogecoin, according to data from CoiMnarketCap.com.\n\nBehind Bitcoin and Ethereum, these are the largest cryptocurrencies on the market:\n\nTether USDt (USDT): This stablecoin, with a market cap of roughly $111 billion, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is a popular choice for investors seeking stability within the crypto market.\n\nBNB (BNB): The native coin of the Binance ecosystem, BNB, has a market cap of around $91 billion and is used for various purposes within the Binance exchange and its blockchain applications.\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana, known for its fast transaction processing speeds, currently has a market cap of approximately $80 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the spot Bitcoin ETF launches and increasingly likely spot Ethereum approvals are positive developments, but they don't guarantee a flood of spot ETFs for more cryptocurrencies. The SEC will likely continue cautiously, prioritizing established cryptocurrencies with well-structured ETF proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved"

This development comes as amended 19b-4 forms have been submitted, although progress on S-1 forms has been minimal.\n\nA senior executive at an issuing firm revealed that these discussions are in the early stages. \u201cIt feels like the Division of Investment Management was somewhat caught off-guard by this shift. So, it\u2019s just starting,\u201d the source commented. Still, there is cautious optimism that the Ethereum ETF will move forward.\n\nFor Ethereum ETFs to be approved, the SEC is supposed to approve the 19b-4 forms, followed by the S-1 registration statements becoming effective. Only then can trading start. Typically, these forms undergo multiple amendments before final approval.\n\nWhile there has been significant movement on the 19b-4 forms, only Fidelity has recently filed an amended S-1 form. With discussions now beginning on the S-1s, further amendments are expected.\n\nThe SEC faces a crucial deadline today to approve or deny VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF 19b-4 form. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas anticipates a decision around 4 p.m., noting that past announcements have varied slightly in timing.\n\nHowever, even with 19b-4 form approvals, the S-1 forms take a long time to complete and approve for use, which can result in a slight delay in trading. Recently, BlackRock and Grayscale submitted their 19b-4 amendments and products related to the spot Ethereum ETFs."

        "content": "Margin Trade Ethereum and Other Top Crypto with up to 50x Leverage Directly from Crypto Wallet\n\nDUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES / ACCESSWIRE / May 23, 2024 / HUX , a leading platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has recently upgraded its offerings, introducing the ability to trade Ethereum, Bitcoin and other top crypto's with up to 50X leverage. Hux caters to both seasoned traders and newcomers, providing sophisticated tools to amplify trading strategies all directly from your crypto wallet.\n\nEthereum Leverage Trading: Long or Short ETH with Up to 50X Leverage on HUX\n\nHow to long Ethereum with Leverage?\n\nLeverage trading allows traders to increase their exposure to Ethereum without needing the full amount of capital typically required. On HUX, traders can choose how much leverage they wish to apply, up to a maximum of 50 times their actual investment. This means that for every dollar, a trader can hold a position worth up to fifty dollars in Ethereum. To initiate a leverage trade, a trader selects their desired level of leverage on the trading dashboard, inputs the amount of ETH they wish to trade, and executes the order, closely monitoring the market for fluctuations.\n\nUnique Trading Features of HUX for Crypto Leverage Trading\n\nBeyond the basic leverage mechanisms, HUX Finance offers several unique features that enhance the trading experience:\n\nDirect Trading from Wallet: HUX allows users to trade directly from their cryptocurrency wallets, bypassing the need to transfer funds to the platform. This feature enhances security and convenience, as traders can maintain control over their funds until the moment of trade.\n\nLimit and Stop-Loss Orders: Traders can set limit orders to execute a trade at a specific price point and stop-loss orders to automatically close a position at a predetermined price. This functionality is crucial for managing risk and securing profits without needing to monitor the market continuously.\n\nOne-Click Trading: For those looking to execute trades quickly, HUX offers a one-click trading feature, which simplifies the trading process. This is particularly useful in volatile market conditions where speed is of the essence.\n\nThese features, combined with high leverage options, make HUX a robust platform for trading Ethereum, catering to both novice and experienced traders by providing tools that facilitate effective trading strategies and risk management.\n\nHow to Short Ethereum on HUX?\n\nShorting Ethereum is a strategy used by traders who anticipate that the price of ETH will decrease. On HUX, to short ETH, traders select the 'Short' option, effectively selling ETH at the current market price with the expectation to buy it back at a lower price in the future. This is done using leverage to increase potential gains from small price movements. Establishing a short position involves specifying the amount of ETH to short and the level of leverage. Traders also have the option to set limit orders to enter the market at a specific price, and use stop-loss orders to manage risk by specifying a price at which the position should be automatically closed to prevent significant losses.\n\nStory continues\n\nRisk Management and Auto-Deleveraging\n\nNavigating high leverage and short positions comes with significant risks, particularly from volatile market movements that could lead to rapid gains or losses. HUX's risk management tools are designed to help traders manage these scenarios effectively. The platform includes features like real-time liquidation alerts and auto-deleveraging (ADL), which helps maintain market stability by automatically reducing leverage in overly exposed positions, ensuring the market's balance and integrity. Trading Ethereum on HUX involves certain fees, which are clearly outlined in the platform's fee structure.

        "title": "Buterin's Ethereum Transfer Sparks Crypto Frenzy: $300K Surge For Privacy Shield - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, cofounder of Ethereum, made a notable move in the cryptocurrency space today by transferring 80 ETH, valued at approximately $300,000, to the privacy-focused coin mixer Railgun. This transaction marks the latest in a series of monthly transfers Buterin has made to Railgun over the past six months.\n\nRailgun, renowned within the crypto community for its robust privacy protocols, offers coin mixing services designed to protect user anonymity and prevent malicious activities. Buterin has been an outspoken advocate for Railgun\u2019s privacy pools protocol, which he argues significantly bolsters user privacy by complicating efforts to trace transactions back to their origin. \u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d Buterin has previously stated, underscoring the critical role of privacy in cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe privacy pools protocol employed by Railgun uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transactional anonymity, addressing mounting concerns about privacy breaches in the crypto ecosystem. This innovative approach has made Railgun a favored platform for users seeking heightened security and confidentiality in their crypto dealings.\n\nEthereum Navigates Privacy Imperatives\n\nButerin\u2019s consistent use of Railgun reflects a broader industry trend towards prioritizing privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. As regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies intensifies globally, platforms like Railgun, which emphasize privacy, are increasingly viewed as essential for maintaining transactional confidentiality while complying with regulatory requirements. This trend is particularly significant for Ethereum, which continues to see growing adoption and an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nThe timing of Buterin\u2019s latest transfer coincides with a bullish phase for Ethereum\u2019s market performance. Recent data shows ETH trading at $3,740, a 2.06% increase over the past 24 hours and a significant 29% rise over the past week. This surge in Ethereum\u2019s price is fueled by community anticipation around potential approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nButerin\u2019s strategic move underscores the importance of privacy-focused solutions like Railgun in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to gain traction and regulatory landscapes shift, the role of platforms like Railgun in safeguarding user privacy is set to become increasingly vital."

        "title": "SEC Approves All Spot Ethereum ETFs - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The culmination of a tumultuous journey has finally arrived, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the issuance of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Indeed, the decision arrived just five months after the agency granted similar approval to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs to start the year.\n\nThe decision marks the approval of the country\u2019s second crypto-based ETF. Moreover, it represents a monumental shift in the overall accessibility of the second-largest cryptocurrency to institutional investors.\n\nBREAKING: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC officially approves all spot Ethereum ETFs. May 23, 2024\n\nThe official filing was published briefly by the SEC, but it was taken down shortly after by the regulator, possibly due to being leaked early. The filing has since been republished. The SEC initially looked to delay the approval decision as long as they could due to previous sentiment against cryptocurrencies, but now the ETF market will include both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Issuers will still have to wait for their individual filings to be approved.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Chair Gary Gensler: \u2018Stay Tuned\u2019 on Ethereum ETF Decision\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Approved by SEC\n\nFollowing the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024, the market anticipated what cryptocurrency could be next. Naturally, all eyes are directed toward Ethereum. Although it appears likely, the overall sentiment of the SEC has diminished optimism that such an approval could take place.\n\nThat changed significantly at the start of May\u2019s second to last week. Seemingly out of nowhere, Bloomberg increased the approval odds from 25% to 75%. Thereafter, the market began anticipating the impending arrival of the Ethereum-based investment offering.\n\nNow, that anticipation has been rewarded as the SEC has approved all Spot Ethereum ETFs. The landmark decision means that the United States now features crypto-based ETFs for the two most prominent digital assets in the world. Moreover, it is a critical part of a greater transition for the country\u2019s perspective on the assets.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Cryptocurrencies To Buy For 5X Gains In Anticipation Of Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nConversely, applications for the Ether-based ETFs have been submitted by a plethora of issuers. Specifically, VanEck, ARK21 Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaaxy, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock. Of those firms, VanEck faced the most immediate approval deadline.\n\nWhat Is The Next Step For Spot Ethereum ETFs?\n\nNow that Ethereum ETF 19b-4 forms have been approved, issuers must wait for their S-1 forms to be approved before trading of the assets can commence. These forms are necessary to offer new securities publicly. This process may take more time for the SEC to process for each filer, especially if the regulator still holds any dissatisfaction for Ethereum ETFs. Based on the timeline for the Bitcoin ETFs, this process could take anywhere from weeks to months.\n\nAll eyes are on how the situation could affect the market as a whole. Bitcoin\u2019s offering led the asset to reach an all-time high in just three months. Many experts predict similar developments for Ethereum, with building anticipation of the ETF leading the asset to increase almost 30% over the last 7 days, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s powerful new \u2018EigenLayer\u2019 promises a wave of innovation. But is it a threat to the blockchain? - Fortune",
        "content": "Ethereum has spent the current bull market living in the shadow of Bitcoin, but two recent developments could thrust the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain back into the spotlight. The first is the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s surprise move to greenlight Ethereum ETFs. The second is a popular but divisive new investing feature called EigenLayer, which has received $100 million in backing from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Crypto.\n\nEigenLayer is a new protocol, or set of instructions, that sits atop the main Ethereum blockchain. It offers a way for those who have already invested tokens by means of staking\u2014a blockchain feature that rewards those who lock up their tokens to secure the network\u2014the ability to \u201crestake\u201d those tokens. The term is what it sounds like. By restaking, users take Ethereum tokens they have already invested and then invest them again. But instead of receiving a reward from the Ethereum network, as happens with staking, those who restake get paid by other projects piggybacking off the blockchain\u2019s existing security pool.\n\nRestaking has existed for some time but EigenLayer is seeking to turbocharge the process by adding a lot more participants. The protocol aspires to be something akin to an Amazon Web Services for cryptoeconomic security.\n\nThe implications of this are \u201cprofound,\u201d a16z wrote in a blog post about the company, noting that EigenLayer has the potential to accelerate innovation on Ethereum \u201c100x faster.\u201d While this appears to be a promising development for the blockchain, EigenLayer has yet to be tested at scale. And while it could result in a burst of innovation for Ethereum, some point to a major potential drawback: a new concentration of risk that, in a worst-case scenario, could harm both users and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Should Ethereum users view EigenLayer with excitement, fear, or both?\n\n\u2018Opens up a wormhole\u2019\n\nThe arrival of EigenLayer is a boon both to investors, who can now more easily earn an additional slice of yield, and for developers who can more quickly add a trust layer in the form of collateral. The issue, however, is that using the same pool of collateral to secure multiple aspects of the blockchain creates new vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt opens up a wormhole,\u201d Rushi Manche, cofounder of Ethereum layer 2 Movement Labs, told Fortune. Manche raised a troubling hypothetical posed by EigenLayer critics: What happens if there\u2019s a hack or a bug in the restaking smart contract? How does that affect the wider ecosystem which is also relying on this single deposit?\n\nAt the same time, Manche noted that proponents say \u201can entire new design space has opened up\u201d for developers thanks to EigenLayer, allowing the same asset to be stretched much further and achieve much more. From this view, the rewards far outweigh the risk. It\u2019s also worth considering the drawbacks if tools like EigenLayer are not available.\n\nSpecifically, in the absence of restaking, decentralized applications built on top of Ethereum must create their own proof-of-stake token\u2014a high bar of entry for any startup. With restaking, protocols can dip into the main blockchain\u2019s almost $95 billion of staked Ether for security. To revisit the cloud computing analogy: If hackers want to attack small businesses, they have to get past the likes of Google Cloud or AWS on which those businesses rely. EigenLayer proponents make the same case: Hackers need to get past a security system created by Ethereum, which has worth more than triple the market cap of Nike.\n\nBut, what happens when the same collateral gets reused again and again?\n\n\u201cEigenLayer reminds me of the 2008 recession: undercollateralize, overleverage. That\u2019ll go well,\u201d one X user posted\u2014just one of the industry onlookers who have drawn parallels with the financial crash, where banks rehypothecated subprime mortgage loans.\n\nAustin Campbell, the former head of portfolio management at Paxos, told Fortune that the comparison isn\u2019t trivial. \u201cAt the core of every levered system is the simple truth that the more leverage you use, the less stable your system is,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is a risk of \u201ccascading failures\u201d if one project fails, agrees Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. But he and many experts were also quick to offer nuance to the 2008 parallels: Restaking doesn\u2019t involve rinse-and-repeat borrowing and lending. Instead, it\u2019s taking a locked-up asset, and locking it up again. Think of it more like reusing the security deposit on an apartment to secure further apartments, suggests Jack O\u2019Holleran, CEO of Skale, an Ethereum layer 2.\n\nBut then what if you trash both apartments?\n\nOne scenario of so-called apartment trashing would be if those operating the restaking services\u2014known as AVS for \u201cactively validated services\u201d\u2014choose to devalue the restaked tokens. \u201cThere could be this \u2018house of cards\u2019 effect, but backwards,\u201d says O\u2019Holleran.\n\nThe debate is analogous to the criticism of liquid staking provider Lido, which currently accounts for 28% of all Ethereum being staked. In theory, Lido introduces a \u201ccentralized point of failure\u201d which is \u201cobviously concerning,\u201d Tekin Salimi, founder of dao5 Capital and seed investor in EigenLater, told Fortune. But in his view, rather than barring this innovation, diversifying the liquid staking providers is the solution.\n\nNoting these concerns, EigenLayer says on its website that it includes a \u201cveto committee\u201d to contain slashing\u2014the term used in the Ethereum world for destroying the collateral of validators who fail to fulfill their duties\u2014and to prevent contagion to the mainnet or other protocols. It will serve as a \u201cdoubly-trusted intermediary between AVS and staker.\u201d So, slashing conditions fall to each AVS, instead of the overall protocol\u2019s discretion. But what this will really look like in practice, is unclear. To that effect, slashing risks remain \u201cthe most real and yet the most undefined\u201d of all those raised, thinks Vance Spencer, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t overload the system\u2019 Ethereum founder warns\n\nEigenLayer has given rise to specific security concerns, but also to a more broader existential one: What fraction of staked tokens can be concentrated on a separate protocol on Ethereum, which holds up decentralization as its paramount value? According to O\u2019Holleran, empowering EigenLayer amounts to the Ethereum community giving considerable leverage and power to another system. Furthermore, copycat restaking services are also popping up, such as Karak, which announced a $48 million Series A raise last month. In addition, an unnamed but similar version is soon coming to market, sources close to the matter told Fortune.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s founder, raised concerns about EigenLayer in a blog post last May. \u201cBe wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the \u201cscope\u201d of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d he wrote. Buterin warns of the \u201cslippery slope\u201d of the underlying network\u2019s \u201cfragile\u201d social consensus losing credibility. His message was clear: Don\u2019t overload the network\u2019s consensus.\n\nOne of the concentration risks of top concern to Buterin is overloading the system\u2019s security.\n\nThe strength of Ethereum\u2019s security system is directly correlated to the economic value of the network\u2014it would be prohibitively expensive for hackers to muster the resources to defeat the consensus system that protects the network. \u201cWe agree that Ether is being used to secure the main net network, and that is the only purpose thereof,\u201d says Campbell. But if you are using your staked tokens to secure Ethereum and other networks, then the surface of things that Ether is being used to secure grows. So, the value resting on any single point gets larger, explains Campbell, which may provide more attractive incentives for hackers.\n\nThe second concentration risk concerns decision-making. Let\u2019s say 40% of Ethereum\u2019s tokens eventually becomes restaked and EigenLayer\u2019s smart contract experiences a hack or bug. It\u2019s unclear when there would be consensus to rollback Ethereum to release it, explains Tom Schmidt, partner at crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that threshold is,\u201d he admits."

        "title": "SEC approves Ethereum ETFs, aligning ETH closer to commodity in industry win - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 19b-4 filings, marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry. The decision, announced today, allows Ethereum ETFs from asset managers such as Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise to be listed on their respective exchanges.\n\nEthereum rose 2% on the news and was trading at $3,900 as of press time, based on CryptoSlate data.\n\nThe approval follows a rigorous application process and extensive market analysis. Grayscale\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Craig Salm, previously highlighted that the SEC had already addressed key issues during the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are applicable to Ethereum ETFs as well. These issues include creation and redemption processes, cash versus in-kind transactions, and custody concerns. Salm emphasized that the SEC\u2019s prior engagement with Bitcoin ETF issuers laid the groundwork for Ethereum ETFs, noting the strong correlation between ETH futures and spot prices as a compelling factor for approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision comes after a period of uncertainty and skepticism among market analysts. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had previously estimated a 25% chance of approval by May 23, citing the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement compared to the Bitcoin ETF approval process. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Hong Kong\u2019s ETH ETF approval, and recent crypto wins in Congress had raised hopes among crypto proponents despite the SEC\u2019s historically cautious stance under Gary Gensler\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe approval process included a public comment period, during which the SEC sought feedback on various aspects of the proposed ETFs, including custodianship of funds, creation, and redemption models, and sponsor fees. This phase mirrored the approach taken with spot Bitcoin ETF applications, encouraging feedback from US citizens and organizations.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to have a significant impact on the digital assets market. Hong Fang, president of crypto exchange OKX, noted that while Ethereum\u2019s price has risen this year, it has lagged behind Bitcoin\u2019s gains, a disparity likely influenced by market anticipation of the SEC\u2019s decision. The approval is anticipated to boost investor confidence and increase market liquidity.\n\nSeveral issuers filed applications to list their ETF on the NYSE Arca exchange, with Coinbase Custody serving as the custodian. Bitwise\u2019s analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the ETH spot market and the CME ETH futures market, a critical factor in meeting SEC requirements to monitor potential market manipulation.\n\nDespite the positive outcome, some industry insiders had expressed concerns about the SEC\u2019s approach. Participants in recent meetings with the SEC described the talks as one-sided, with agency staff withholding substantive comments on the proposals. This contrasted with the detailed discussions that preceded the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe approval also comes amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of Ethereum\u2019s classification as either a security or a commodity. Reports suggest that the SEC is investigating Ethereum\u2019s regulatory classification, which added uncertainty to the approval prospects. However, today\u2019s decision indicates a favorable stance towards Ethereum-based financial products and a potential indication that Ethereum can be considered a commodity.\n\nThe approval is a landmark event for the crypto industry, reflecting the growing interest in crypto-asset financial products among traditional investment firms. As the market reacts to this development, stakeholders will closely monitor the performance and impact of these newly approved ETFs.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 9:59 am UTC on May. 27, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 3.33% over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency exchange is expected to be a major beneficiary if the Security and Exchange Commission approves pending applications for Ether ETFs.\n\nIn a stunning reversal, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of Ether, effectively allowing investors to transact in the cryptocurrency on traditional stock exchanges.\n\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas increased their odds of the ETFs being approved from 25% to 75%. \u201cHearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they'd be denied),\u201d Balchunas wrote on X .\n\nThe SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs in January, but industry observers had been growing increasingly pessimistic about the chance for Ether ETFs to be approved because the agency had not been communicating with the companies that had applied for them. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had in the past said that he believed Ether and so-called altcoins to be unregulated securities. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market valuation, is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo help push the ETFs across the finish line, this morning five members of the U.S. House of Representatives, a mix of Republicans and Democrats, sent Gensler a letter urging him to \u201cmaintain a consistent and equitable approach\u201d to the Bitcoin ETF applications and approve the pending Ether ETFs.\n\nThe letter was led by French Hill (R-Ark.) and signed by Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), and Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.). Hill is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion of the House Financial Services Committee, and Emmer is the third-ranking Republican on the panel.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the Commission should apply the same principles set forth in the approval of the spot bitcoin ETPs [exchange-traded products] as it evaluates the pending ether ETP applications as the legal considerations pertinent to bitcoin also apply to ether,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cWith the Commission\u2019s actions earlier this year, it seems a natural progression that would not only demonstrate consistency in the Commission\u2019s application of its standards but would also affirm the legal reasoning that facilitated the spot bitcoin ETPs decision. We encourage the Commission to continue enabling and embracing financial innovation while ensuring the full protection of the federal securities laws for investors,\u201d\n\nFour of the signers of the letter have been among the top six recipients in the House of campaign funding in the 2024 election cycle from employees of Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange that has been selected to act as a custodian for several of the proposed ether ETFs.\n\nAccording to The Information , \u201cAt least six out of the nine investment firms that plan to issue ether ETFs have picked Coinbase as a custodian, meaning the crypto company will safeguard ether for giants including BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton. Judging by the success of bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January, Coinbase could soon oversee billions of dollars worth of ether and entrench its position at the center of the crypto ETF boom.\u201d\n\nHill has received more Coinbase money than any other House member so far this election cycle, according to OpenSecrets . Federal Election Commission records show that his campaign and leadership PAC have received a combined $35,600 from the company\u2019s employees since the beginning of last year, including $11,600 from its CEO Brian Armstrong."

        "title": "Crypto Roundup: Bitcoin Stays Steady, Ethereum Jumps 23%, and Furrever Token's 15X Returns Capture Attention - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, May 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity today, marked by notable developments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Furrever Token. As Bitcoin holds steady on Bitcoin Day, maintaining its value from yesterday, Ethereum has captured significant attention by surging 23% in just one week. Adding to the excitement, Furrever Token has caught the eye of many investors with its potential for up to 15X returns, making waves in the crypto community. These dynamic shifts highlight the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies and the diverse opportunities they present for traders and investors alike.\n\nEthereum Surges 23% in a Week Amid Record ETF Trading Volumes\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,750, nearly unchanged from yesterday but up 23% over the past week. This surge is driven by growing anticipation of spot Ethereum ETF approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Ethereum futures ETFs hit a record daily trading volume of $47.75 million, a 40% increase from the previous peak in March. ProShares' Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) led the way, accounting for $43.14 million of the volume, followed by VanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) with $2.6 million and Bitwise's Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) with $2.01 million.\n\nDespite this new record, Ethereum futures ETF trading volumes remain far below those of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $2.16 billion in trading on Tuesday, dominated by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT with $1.12 billion. Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also saw a significant increase, reaching $684.44 million in daily trading volume, the highest since May 2021.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approvals from 25% to 75%, citing a possible shift in the SEC\u2019s stance on crypto regulation. This optimism has further fueled Ethereum's recent gains.\n\nAs the market awaits potential SEC approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, the increased trading activity and positive sentiment continue to bolster ETH's price, positioning it for further growth.\n\nBitcoin Holds Steady at $69,400 Amid Market Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $69,400, maintaining a stable position from yesterday but up by 5% over the past week. The slight drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price on Wednesday came as traders cashed in on recent gains fueled by optimism over a potential spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nEther, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a pullback after reaching a two-month high earlier in the week. This movement was driven by reports of progress towards the approval of spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is expected to make a key decision later this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the optimism surrounding the spot Ether ETF, broader market sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing concerns about U.S. interest rates. Persistent inflation and warnings from several Federal Reserve officials about the need for more evidence of decreasing inflation before rate cuts can begin have kept traders wary.\n\nAttention is now focused on the minutes from the Fed's late-April meeting, which could provide further insights into the central bank\u2019s plans regarding interest rates. High interest rates generally have a negative impact on crypto markets, as they reduce the attractiveness of high-risk and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe cautious sentiment in the market underscores the delicate balance between optimism over potential regulatory approvals and concerns over macroeconomic factors affecting the crypto landscape. As traders await further cues from the Fed, Bitcoin's price stability reflects the broader uncertainty in the market.\n\nFurrever Token's 15X Return Promise Attracts a Wave of Investors\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) has captured the crypto community's attention with its promise of up to 15X returns for presale investors after its official launch. This enticing potential has sparked a significant influx of investors eager to capitalize on the opportunity before the presale concludes.\n\nThe Furrever Token presale has been a roaring success, with over $1.1 million raised in just three months.

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation considering formal conflict of interest policy after community backlash - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum Foundation (EF) is considering implementing a formal conflict of interest policy following backlash over two prominent developers joining EigenLayer as advisors.\n\nExecutive director Aya Miyaguchi addressed the issue in a social media post, emphasizing the importance of maintaining credible neutrality within the organization. She said the foundation shares the community\u2019s concerns and is committed to maintaining trust.\n\nMiyaguchi said:\n\n\u201cIt is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient, and we have been working on a formal policy to address this problem for a while now. We will be accelerating this work and will share an update soon.\u201d\n\nControversy\n\nThe controversy began on May 18 when prominent crypto trader Jordan Fish, known as Cobie, publicly questioned Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin about the ethics of EF developers receiving significant financial incentives from projects built on the network.\n\nCobie\u2019s tweet specifically used EigenLayer as an example and sparked widespread discussion on social media about potential conflicts of interest. He wrote:\n\n\u201cHow do you feel about Ethereum Foundation core developers or researchers taking life-changing packages from projects built on Ethereum to become \u2018advisors,\u2019 when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future? For example \u2014 purely theoretically, of course \u2014 let\u2019s say, EigenLayer.\u201d\n\nFollowing Cobie\u2019s tweet, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake disclosed his advisory role at EigenLayer on May 19. Drake revealed that he received a substantial incentive in Eigen tokens, estimated to be worth millions of dollars over a three-year vesting period.\n\nThe disclosure heightened concerns about transparency and potential conflicts of interest between EigenLayer and the Ethereum Foundation. Drake also stated that the information had been public since May 3, and the timing of the disclosure with Cobie\u2019s tweet was a coincidence.\n\nOn May 21, another Ethereum Foundation researcher, Dankrad Feist, also disclosed his advisory role at EigenLayer. Feist, known for his work on \u201cdanksharding,\u201d confirmed he had also received a significant allocation of EIGEN tokens and assured the community that his advisory role would not influence his positions on the development of EigenLayer.\n\nConflict of interest concerns\n\nThe disclosures have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, especially given the systemic risks EigenLayer might pose to Ethereum. EigenLayer is a platform that allows users to deposit and \u201cre-stake\u201d Ether from various liquid staking tokens to secure third-party networks or validated services.\n\nMany blockchain experts have expressed concerns about the potential centralization and additional load imposed on stakers by running restaking services.\n\nDrake assured the community that he would reinvest or donate all proceeds to worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem and pledged to end the advisorship if EigenLayer\u2019s direction conflicted with Ethereum\u2019s interests.\n\nFeist, in his disclosure, emphasized that he would take contrarian views on EigenLayer to focus on risks and decentralization. He wrote:\n\n\u201cI am taking this position personally, not representing the Ethereum Foundation, and with a focus on risks and decentralization. I do receive a significant amount of tokens from this position. I do not believe that they will change or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed, but I believe that the community should know about this so that they can keep me accountable.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s move to formalize a conflict of interest policy marks a significant step in addressing the community\u2019s concerns and maintaining trust within the ecosystem. The foundation is expected to provide further updates on the policy soon."

        "content": "Ethereum ETH/USD enthusiasts were left scratching their heads this week after the long-awaited approval of a spot Ethereum ETF failed to ignite the anticipated price surge.\n\nWhat Happened: While many expected a repeat of Bitcoin\u2018s BTC/USD rise following similar ETF approval in January, ETH prices have remained relatively flat.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the 19b-4 forms is a crucial step in the regulatory process but does not fully clear the path for ETF trading.\n\nThe S-1 registration statements, which provide detailed information about the ETFs to the SEC, must still be approved for trading to commence.\n\nThis approval is often seen as a formality, but the current political climate has added uncertainty.\n\nHowever, new information suggests the approval process might not be as straightforward as initially believed.\n\nGabriel Shapiro, co-founder of MetaLeX Labs, explains that only the 19b-4 forms were approved, not the S-1 registration statements.\n\nThis limited approval was made by the SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets under \u201cdelegated authority,\u201d allowing any commissioner to challenge the decision within ten days.\n\nShapiro suggests this procedural move indicates an attempt to obscure the political nature of the vote.\n\nShapiro hints at a broader political strategy, suggesting the SEC\u2019s actions are part of a \u201chorse trade\u201d to secure environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rules before a potential challenge by Donald Trump if he wins the 2024 election.\n\nThis complex backdrop contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of the S-1 forms, which Shapiro believes are unlikely to be approved soon.\n\nHe describes the situation as \u201cpolitical progress\u201d for crypto, similar to the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act.\n\nAlso Read: EXCLUSIVE: All You Need To Know About The FIT21 \u2018Crypto Bill\u2019\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, offers a counterpoint, expressing confidence that the S-1 forms will eventually be approved and downplaying the likelihood of significant challenges.\n\nHe attributes the lack of a price spike to the fact that the ETF approval was already anticipated by the market following earlier news.\n\n\u201cS-1s will be approved, don't be silly\u2026 It prob didn't moon IMO bc approval was baked in already based on Monday's bombshell news,\u201d Balchunas tweeted.\n\nScott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital questions the SEC\u2019s strategy, arguing that using crypto regulations as leverage for ESG rules undermines the commission\u2019s credibility and political strategy, especially if they fail to achieve their ESG objectives.\n\n\u201cThis is tough to square\u2026they don\u2019t get ESG rules and also lose all credibility that they actually intend to govern reasonably in a Biden second term,\u201d Johnsson stated.\n\nStaking and Market Dynamics\n\nPranav Kanade, Investment Partner at VanEck\u2018s Digital Assets Alpha Fund, highlighted another crucial factor: the nature of ETH staking in the approved ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETFs approved on May 23rd do not currently include staking, and all of the ETH held in these ETFs will remain unstaked. However, even if this were to change (via new staked ETH ETFs), the risk of staking concentration would be largely mitigated by three factors,\u201d Kanade explained.\n\nHe pointed out that regulatory and compliance requirements would likely prevent U.S. ETF issuers from staking with dominant players like Lido.\n\nAdditionally, emerging staking protocols are already reducing Lido\u2019s market share, and Lido itself is diversifying its node operators, minimizing concentration risks.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThese developments highlight the intricate interplay between regulatory actions and political considerations affecting Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nInvestors remain cautious as they await further clarity on the full approval process.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the implications of these regulatory shifts and the future of digital assets, industry leaders and investors can join Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nThis event will provide valuable insights into the evolving regulatory landscape and investment strategies within the digital asset space.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $108M Inflows While Ethereum ETF Potential Remains Uncertain\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "The broader crypto market experienced significant volatility during the past day as the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved several spot-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nCryptoSlate data shows that the top 20 digital assets by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, saw losses exceeding 3% each. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two digital assets by market capitalization, fell to $67,051 and $3,671, respectively.\n\nSeveral market analysts have suggested that the ETH ETF approval was a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event. Investors who anticipated the approval had already positioned themselves accordingly. During the past week, ETH\u2019s price had risen by more than 20%, with CryptoSlate observing that the Ethereum futures market hit a one-year high of 3.6 million ETH.\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, noted:\n\n\u201cSeems like the market has already priced the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Grayscale\u2019s ETHE discount to ETH has significantly narrowed in the last few days. The same happened between GBTC and Bitcoin as the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval was nearing.\u201d\n\nSome experts also pointed to the ETFs\u2019 delayed launch as one of the reasons for the muted market performance. The SEC has only approved the ETFs and has yet to grant them the clearance to launch, which requires an approved S-1 filing, though this is more of a formality.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart explained:\n\n\u201cThis is just 19b-4 approval. Also needs to be an approval on the S-1 documents which is going to take time. We\u2019re expecting it to take a couple weeks but could take longer.\u201d\n\nOver $400 million liquidated\n\nOver 107,000 crypto traders suffered losses exceeding $400 million due to the market\u2019s subdued performance.\n\nCoinglass data reveals that ETH long traders, who expected the ETF news to boost the digital asset price, bore the brunt of these losses, totaling around $107 million. The largest single liquidation was a $12.4 million long bet on Ethereum on the Binance exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin traders lost approximately $75 million during the same period.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith big tech companies like Google and Meta pumping potentially unwanted AI features into their messaging platforms, there is a growing call for decentralized and encrypted alternatives that don't rely on the centralized heavyweights.\n\nOne company that aims to provide this service is Here Not There Labs, creator of the Towns social app and the newly launched River Protocol. River aims to offer an alternative to chat platforms like Slack and Discord, powered by blockchain tech and both customizable and private for creators.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of social media products that are decentralized, but you don\u2019t see a lot of social media protocols,\u201d Here Not There Labs co-founder and CEO Ben Rubin told Decrypt. \u201cI do not know of a social media [app] that is owned and operated by the participants of its network that have a means to create trust between one another in a way that is permissionless.\u201d\n\nCreated in 2023, River Protocol is designed to allow developers to build decentralized, real-time messaging applications using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 blockchain, off-chain nodes, and smart contracts on Ethereum scaling network Base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA screenshot from Towns, which is built on River Protocol. Image: Here Not There Labs\n\nAccording to the River Protocol website, the project is governed by the River Association, a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO, that allows RVR token holders to participate in the protocol\u2019s future.\n\nRiver Protocol joins a growing number of decentralized applications offering secure communications and social media including Farcaster, BlueSky, Nostr, and Blockscan Chat. But while many social media protocols are aiming to take on Twitter, River Protocol is more focused on teams, companies, and projects who need their own dedicated server.\n\n\u201cEach group is represented as a space, and each space is its own smart contract that is being deployed on-chain,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cWhat the smart contract does is allow the group to issue membership into the space, and also program the entitlement of who can read and write, and under what conditions.\"\n\nAccording to Rubin, this type of setup works best for large groups with specific roles assigned to members like moderators, or who need to set restricted access to channels in the group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRiver stores content off-chain and uses on-chain roll-ups. A bespoke appchain handles messaging to maintain speeds to provide a similar experience to Telegram or WhatsApp. This separation, Rubin added, ensures robust security for permissions while optimizing messaging to be fast and user-friendly\u2014yet maintains user control and decentralization.\n\n\u201cWhile our main deployment is on-chain, you can read on [Ethereum] mainnet, Polygon, or across any other chains to compose rules together,\u201d Here Not There Labs co-founder and CTO Brian Meek added. \u201cAll of that creates a trust route for the messaging, which is happening in the River protocol. But you can cryptographically verify that what is in the River protocol is what is allowed based on what's on-chain.\u201d\n\nOther potential user cases for River Protocol besides messaging apps, Meek added, include connecting players of decentralized video games.\n\n\u201cEverything benefits from communication,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can compose their protocol together into your game, into your app, or into whatever other decentralized experiences you have, and bring in a real-time provable, verifiable, end-to-end encrypted communication experience.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Sander Lutz.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt's Ethereum ETF deadline day for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now sources close to the SEC are saying the regulator has shown signs of warming to the idea of allowing spot Ethereum ETFs to trade.\n\nUnnamed sources told Fox Business that the commission has been taking cues from recent court rulings and its past decision to allow ETH futures ETFs to trade as it considers whether to grant permission for nine funds to begin trading.\n\nMost pressing for the SEC is making a decision on the filings from Cboe exchange to list the VanEck Ethereum ETF and the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF.\n\nBut that's not all. Counting VanEck and Ark Invest with 21Shares, there are nine total applicants. The rest include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale\u2014which wants to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) the way it did its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\u2014Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco with Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is north of $3,800\u2014that's 2% higher than it was this time yesterday.\n\nTrading volume swelled to $45 billion in the past 24 hours as hype for a potential Ethereum ETF has surged. For reference, that's just $4 billion shy of the amount of Bitcoin that changed hands in the past day, according to Coinglass.\n\nWhat's more, Ethereum open interest has grown by another 4% to $16 billion. That's also come with some bad news for Ethereum derivatives traders. In the past day $43 million worth of Ethereum futures positions have been liquidated, which is nearly double the value of Bitcoin futures positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.\n\nMeanwhile, Gensler faced tough questions in a letter from the House Financial Services Committee yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublican lawmakers, including HFSC Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC), were curious about the regulator having recently given digital asset firm Prometheum the green light to begin offering an Ethereum custody service.\n\nThe fact that Prometheum is an SEC-regulated firm and got permission from the commission to offer the service seems to imply that the commission is treating ETH like a security\u2014even though it has countless times refused to share its position on the matter.\n\nAs a footnote: An unredacted version of the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC over its treatment of Ethereum says that an internal memo circulated last year instructed commission staff to treat ETH like a security."

This listing is considered a crucial milestone before obtaining final approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlthough VanEck's ETF is currently listed as inactive on the DTCC website, indicating that it cannot be processed until it receives regulatory approvals, it is worth noting that it is not the first Ethereum ETF to be listed by the DTCC. Franklin Templeton's spot Ethereum ETF secured a listing on the platform a month ago.\n\nThe DTCC's ETF list comprises both active ETFs that can be processed and ETFs that are currently inactive and awaiting regulatory clearance. Additionally, reports suggest that SEC officials have reached out to major exchanges like Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange to update and modify existing applications for spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe final deadline for the SEC's decision on VanEck's spot Ether ETF application is May 23. The SEC's request for financial managers to amend and resubmit their 19b-4 filings for proposed spot Ether ETFs was seen as a positive sign by some analysts, increasing the potential likelihood of approval from 25% to 75%"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nExperts are warning of the looming threat that the newly approved U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could pose if staking is ever introduced.\n\nIn a crucial bid to push the approval process over the line, Ethereum ETF issuers dropped language regarding the staking of customer ETH.\n\nWhen the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus in September 2022, it required ETH to be locked up in a process called staking. The staked ETH belongs to validators who help to secure the network. They\u2019re rewarded for staking their ETH, but can be penalized if they don\u2019t verify transactions on time.\n\nCentralization concerns have arisen in the past when single validators gained control of large portions of staked ETH. At time, people have even compared liquid staking provider Lido to a \"cartel\" when it swelled in size.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRemoving staking language from ETH ETF applications was a move to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution could cause a long-term problem.\u201d Ganesh Swami, CEO and co-founder of blockchain data analytics company Covalent, told Decrypt, \u201cIf multiple ETFs use the same custodians, this type of centralization would cause concentration to increase, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.\u201d\n\nTaking a look at the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that Coinbase is the custodian for 90% of the total assets. While this poses an obvious centralization risk already, adding staking to the equation, well, ups the stakes.\n\n\u201cStaking ETH ETFs are not a new concept, they exist in other countries, but clearly the U.S market brings a much larger scale,\u201d Andrew O\u2019Neill, analytical lead on digital assets at S&P Global, told Decrypt. \u201cThe risk in that case is that if ETFs are concentrating their stake with a small number of custodians, this could create validator concentration risks in the consensus mechanism.\u201d\n\nCoinbase, which is already the second largest Ethereum validator, is currently set to be the custodian of at least six out of the nine firms planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If we see similar interest as we did with the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which as a group currently have a market capitalization of $54 billion, this concentration of power could pose a security risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can measure concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower that number, the higher the central point of failure.\u201d Mona El Isa, CEO and co-founder of institutional DeFi company Avantgarde Finance, told Decrypt, \u201cIf any party amassed that much control, they could potentially alter the state of the blockchain itself. That poses serious risks to security.\u201d\n\nIt appears that staking was removed from Ethereum ETF applications due to the SEC\u2019s view that staking is equivalent to a securities service. It\u2019s not without precedence. The SEC has sued companies, like Kraken and Coinbase, to stop them offering staking services to U.S. customers.\n\nAs staking is currently not allowed for ETF providers or custodians, there are no guidelines put in place to reduce the potential centralization and concentration risks that could be looming.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Because the market is not positioned for it. You were saying 25%. I would even think that the market had priced in almost like 0% probability or as close as it gets to no chance whatsoever.\n\nETH has been one of the most hated coins, if not the most hated coin of this cycle, and it\u2019s reflected on price. ETH/BTC is like .052 BTC. So it does make sense for that to go all the way up to at least .070 BTC ($4,865) in the next couple of months. These things happen usually rather fast.\u201d\n\nKr\u00fcger also believes there are institutions that would move to invest in an ETH ETF product.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of demand out there.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.05362 BTC ($3,731) at time of writing.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated earlier this week that it was suddenly open to the prospect of approving spot Ethereum ETFs, after months of stubborn signals to the contrary, the about-face didn\u2019t just catch Crypto Twitter by surprise.\n\nIt also shocked the nation\u2019s top crypto lobbyists, who spend their days tracing minuscule shifts in Washington\u2019s mood on the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a remarkable pivot,\u201d Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a prominent crypto lobbying group, told Decrypt. \u201cIt is one that I did not foresee.\u201d\n\nHow did the pivot come to pass? And after years of relentless hostility against the crypto industry, might the development indicate that the SEC, and the U.S. government more broadly, are changing their tune on crypto?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we've absolutely turned a corner,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt marks a complete shift in understanding about the political importance of crypto.\u201d\n\nCrypto industry lobbyists who spoke with Decrypt attribute the SEC\u2019s sudden tack to a recent change of political winds in the nation\u2019s capital. Most agree the series of events that prompted the change kicked off last week, when President Joe Biden issued a forceful threat to veto a pro-crypto bill.\n\nThe bill, which sought to repeal an SEC rule dubbed SAB 121\u2014which discourages American banks from holding crypto\u2014later passed in the Senate with a surprising amount of support from Biden\u2019s own party. Twelve Democrats supported the bill, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader.\n\nThat degree of Democratic support was not anticipated on Capitol Hill. And it undoubtedly sent a message to the White House, the Blockchain Association\u2019s Smith believes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo have that many [Democrats] break away from the Biden Administration after it already put out a veto threat on it,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is significant.\u201d\n\nExacerbating matters is the fact that, in recent weeks, Republicans including former president Donald Trump have begun embracing crypto more explicitly than ever before\u2014creating the impression among crypto industry leaders that only one political party is on their side.\n\nCody Carbone, Chief Policy Officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, another crypto lobbying group, believes the pressure recently applied by Republicans on crypto, in tandem with the open dissent Biden is now facing on the subject from leaders within his own party, led the president to make a calculated decision to back off crypto\u2014at least for now.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is seeing, in a very tight election that can be swung by a few million votes, that this is not the hill to die on,\u201d Carbone told Decrypt.\n\nThat evolution in Biden\u2019s thinking could already be seen Wednesday, when the president issued a statement regarding another crypto-related bill up for a vote this week\u2014FIT21\u2014which seeks to create a federal framework for regulating crypto. While Biden objected to the bill\u2019s passage, he crucially did not threaten to veto it, as he did last week with the repeal of SAB 121.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, FIT21 easily passed a vote in the House, 279-136, with support from 71 Democrats including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n\nJi Kim, chief legal and policy officer at lobbying group Crypto Council for Innovation, sees the events of the last week as proof that crypto has now\u2014albeit suddenly\u2014 graduated into a topic of consensus within U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cWhat this all means is that crypto is absolutely a bipartisan issue,\" he said, \"and that members of Congress are further realizing crypto is absolutely here to stay.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the same reasons the White House is now tacking on crypto to save face, the SEC is too, crypto lobbyists say\u2014especially given that the unexpectedly popular, bipartisan repeal of SAB 121 singled out the policies of SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nRubber-stamping spot Ethereum ETFs\u2014which would allow Wall Street firms to buy and store ETH on behalf of their clients\u2014might prove the most visible way for Gensler to take some heat off his back, the Blockchain Association\u2019s Kristin Smith estimates.\n\n\u201cI think this is his sort of peace offering, to show that he is open to this space, and he realizes now that the political winds are against him,\u201d she said.\n\nBut crypto lobbyists disagree on what the move would mean for the SEC\u2019s long-term crypto policy moving forward.\n\nSmith is optimistic the change of heart would mark a major shift in how Gensler and the SEC might police crypto from now on.\n\n\u201cI think he's going to have no choice but to back down,\u201d she said of the SEC Chair. \u201cThat doesn't mean he goes back and undoes all the actions that he's initiated\u2014but he's going to have to think twice before doing something aggressive against the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce\u2019s Cody Carbone, however, has a less cheery outlook. He figures spot Ethereum ETF approvals would represent nothing more than a cold and calculated political maneuver on Gensler\u2019s part. A meaningful change in the SEC\u2019s outlook on crypto? Far from it.\n\n\u201cI don't think you're going to see him dropping any of these cases or stop fighting,\u201d Carbone said of Gensler. \u201cI just don't think you'll see any more headlines. Most of his decisions are driven by PR.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Institutions gobbled up Bitcoin after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThey might not show the same interest in Ethereum, according to researcher Noelle Acheson.\n\nBitcoin hit new highs just weeks after the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe move let institutions gobble up more than $12 billion worth of the original cryptocurrency, according to data from pseudonymous analyst Hildobby.\n\nEthereum investors might not be so lucky.\n\nSeveral indicators suggest institutional interest in Ethereum is much lower than it was for Bitcoin, according to researcher Noelle Acheson, former head of market insights for Genesis Global Trading.\n\nShe isn\u2019t the only pessimist.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects Ethereum ETFs to be \u201c10-15% of the assets of the BTC ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe SEC had long fought against the approval of spot crypto ETFs, arguing they were vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nAfter losing a lawsuit filed by crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments, the SEC capitulated in January with the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nStill, it had signalled it would deny applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThat changed this week, amid a flurry of pro-crypto developments in the US.\n\nOn Monday, Balchunas and his colleague James Seyffart updated their odds of spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% from 25%.\n\nThat approval came Thursday, but the actual launch may be weeks or months away. And whether it drives Ethereum to its own all-time high is another matter.\n\n\u201cWhen/if the ETH spot ETFs eventually launch, we should brace ourselves for a disappointing reception,\u201d Acheson wrote in her newsletter, Crypto is Macro.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because institutional investors have shown little interest in existing Ethereum-based products.\n\nIn Hong Kong, which approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last month, Ethereum accounts for less than 15% of the assets under management, Acheson notes.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, investors already have access to Ethereum futures ETFs. And they aren\u2019t that interested.\n\n\u201cThe [assets under management] of the leading ETH futures ETF (EETH) is around 4% that of the leading BTC futures ETF (BITO),\u201d Acheson writes.\n\nAs for the spot Ethereum ETF itself, available data suggests institutional interest might be lacking there as well.\n\n\u201cThe CME is the largest BTC derivatives platform in the market, in terms of open interest,\u201d Acheson writes.\n\n\u201cBut it ranks only fifth in ETH derivatives. US institutional investors are maybe just not really into the ETH narrative?\u201d\n\nTo be sure, open interest in Bitcoin was highest on Binance, with CME taking the top spot just before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already happening with Ethereum: CME was in the sixth spot at the beginning of the week.\n\nAnd Wall Street executives have repeatedly said they see potential in Ethereum.\n\n\u201cRemove the regulatory uncertainty around proof of stake and watch how Wall Street runs to ETH,\u201d investor Jim Bianco wrote on X, referring to the method Ethereum uses to confirm transactions and create new coins.\n\n\u201cIt is an entire ecosystem with borrowing, lending, insurance, tokenomics, staking (yield), stablecoins, NFTS, primitives, L2s, and on and on. Plenty for them to work with here as opposed to hodl-ing one coin,\u201d he said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 3.2% at $67,297 over the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum is down 3.4% at $3,679.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nAleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York.

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ether: SEC opens door to Ethereum ETFs - Business Today",
        "content": "In a landmark decision, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signalled its approval for the potential launch of eight exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. This move follows the SEC's approval of the first bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, marking a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThe SEC's approval on Thursday involved crucial rule changes that pave the way for ETFs that directly invest in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Applications from prominent financial groups such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Ark Invest received the green light. While this represents a major step forward, a second round of approvals will be necessary before these products can officially launch.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding these approvals has fueled a surge in ether's price, which has climbed more than 20% since Monday and over 60% since the beginning of the year. This reflects the growing confidence among investors regarding the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC's decision comes after months of silence on the matter. On Monday, the regulator unexpectedly provided feedback on pending applications to issuers and exchanges, triggering a flurry of paperwork revisions and submissions. This swift action was likely prompted by approaching deadlines for responses to ether ETF applications from VanEck and Ark Invest.\n\nWhile the SEC's Thursday approval marks a significant milestone, the timing of the second round of approvals and the subsequent launch of ether ETFs remains unclear.\n\nCommenting on the development, Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink stated: \"The Ethereum ETF approval is a second large step forward for the crypto industry... The attention and adoption around the Ethereum ETF also proves the long-term thesis we have been building around, that the capital markets will be the next large source of adoption for the cryptocurrency industry, essentially being the key force that is driving it to new heights.\"\n\nNazarov highlighted the potential of the approval to shine a spotlight on Ethereum's smart contract and decentralised application capabilities, which are attracting growing interest from major financial institutions.\n\nSumit Gupta, Co-founder of CoinDCX commented, \"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s green light for spot Ether ETFs is a watershed moment for the crypto industry. It builds on the success of Bitcoin ETFs, offering a secure and regulated way for investors to access Ether. This broader acceptance will fuel mainstream adoption and reflect a maturing regulatory environment, paving the way for further legitimising the entire digital asset space.\"\n\n\"Ethereum plays a pivotal role in the decentralised ecosystem, and this regulatory progress will be instrumental in shaping the future of Web3 and the ongoing digital revolution. The SEC decision is particularly important, as earlier media reports suggested the SEC was investigating the Ethereum Foundation, coupled with the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH), and its potential classification as a security,\" Gupta added.\n\nMeanwhile, Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman of CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem India Ltd said, \"The SEC's approval of Ethereum ETFs marks a watershed moment in digital finance, poised to catalyse a sustained bull run while tempering volatility to align with traditional asset classes. This monumental achievement not only validates the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies but also sets the stage for widespread institutional and retail involvement. Regulated investment vehicles for Ethereum will bolster investor confidence and ignite further innovation within the blockchain sphere.\"\n\nMaradiya added, \"In the Indian market, this development heralds a new era of global digital asset integration, offering invaluable insights for our regulators. Indian investors stand to benefit from expanded portfolio diversification and enhanced access to global crypto markets. This pivotal juncture has the potential to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption in India, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic financial ecosystem. Moreover, it presents retail investors with a unique opportunity to harness the power of this asset class for wealth creation.\"\n\nThis landmark decision by the SEC could potentially usher in a new era for cryptocurrencies, further solidifying their integration into traditional financial markets."
