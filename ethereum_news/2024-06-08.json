        "title": "Top Ethereum Contributor Makes Epic U-Turn With Unexpected Gas Fee Statement - U.Today",
        "content": "Hayden Adams, the founder and CEO of Uniswap Labs, recently made a surprising statement about transaction fees on the ETH network. Adams, who leads the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, declared that users should never have to worry about \"gas fees.\" This unexpected opinion has added a new dimension to the ongoing debate about Ethereum's high transaction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdams' statement comes amid a heated discussion about the expenses associated with Ethereum transactions. Recently, artist Iggy Azalea commented on the issue, questioning how gas fees are used and expressing skepticism about their impact. Although Azalea incorrectly assumed that all fees directly benefit Ethereum's founders, her comments have once again highlighted the issue of high transaction costs.\n\nNo user should ever have to hear the term \u201cgas fee\u201d Advertisement June 8, 2024\n\nThe debate over Ethereum's gas fees has become more intense with the rise of Solana, a blockchain known for its lower transaction costs. Solana's recent performance has led some to speculate about the blockchain's future and its ability to compete with more affordable alternatives.\n\nKey Ethereum developers, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin, have been addressing the gas fee problem for some time. Last month, Buterin introduced EIP-7706, a proposal aimed at optimizing transaction calldata and reducing gas usage. This proposal includes a new type of gas specifically for calldata transactions, with the goal of creating a separate fee market and making calldata more affordable.\n\nAmid Adams' words, Uniswap has continued to succeed, earning over $3.64 billion in total commissions to date. In the past 24 hours alone, Uniswap collected $1.62 million in fees, and over the last month, it amassed $65.95 million."

        "title": "Ethereum Is Making Big Moves. 3 Reasons I'm Buying It Hand Over Fist in June. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum is poised for substantial growth not only in June, but for months and years to come.\n\nThe crypto world is buzzing with excitement as the market rides a wave of bullish momentum. While this surge is promising, it also makes choosing the right cryptocurrency to invest in quite challenging, as nearly everything seems to be on the rise.\n\nAmidst this flurry, one cryptocurrency stands out due to its recent developments and long-term potential: Ethereum (ETH 0.18%). Here are three compelling reasons why I'm investing heavily in Ethereum this June.\n\n1. SEC approval of a spot Ethereum ETF\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to invest in Ethereum right now is the anticipated approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In January, Bitcoin (BTC 0.04%) was the first cryptocurrency to get this approval, and now there is a growing appetite among investors for exposure to the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nThe integration of Ethereum with traditional finance through an exchange-traded fund is incredibly encouraging for many reasons. First, since ETFs can be purchased from brokerage accounts, a spot Ethereum ETF will democratize access for many traditional investors who are uncomfortable buying cryptocurrencies on crypto exchanges. This ease of access can attract a broader range of buyers and potentially drive significant price appreciation.\n\nYet, the most important cohort that the ETFs will cater to is institutional investors. Without the ETFs, institutional investors have been hesitant to purchase cryptocurrencies directly, due to regulatory and security risks. A spot Ethereum ETF approval will allow previously sidelined institutions known for their deep pockets to join in on the game.\n\n2. The tokenization of real-world assets\n\nAnother reason to be bullish on Ethereum is its potential for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Tokenization involves converting physical and intangible assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, making them easier to transfer, trade, and manage. This can include anything from real estate and art to stocks and bonds.\n\nThe market for tokenized RWAs is expected to grow to $10 trillion by 2030, and for many reasons, Ethereum is positioned to capture the bulk of this value. The network's robust decentralization, strong security, and established ecosystem make it an ideal platform for institutions looking to tokenize assets.\n\nIn fact, we are already seeing the beginnings of this movement. For instance, in May, BlackRock (the world's largest asset manager) launched a tokenized fund on Ethereum, marking a significant step toward the convergence of blockchain technology and traditional financial instruments.\n\nHighlighting the transformative potential of blockchain technology, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently stated that tokenization will be \"the next generation for markets.\" And rest assured, Ethereum will be the blockchain of choice for this revolution.\n\n3. Ethereum's leadership in smart contracts and DeFi\n\nThe beginning stages of tokenization on Ethereum are an example of why it is one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Launched in 2015, Ethereum was one of the first blockchains to introduce smart contracts, making it the first programmable cryptocurrency. This pioneering status has given Ethereum a competitive advantage in terms of experimentation and documentation, two crucial factors developers consider when choosing a blockchain to build on.\n\nOver the years, this experimentation has led to the development of several novel applications of blockchain technology, such as decentralized finance (DeFi). By using Ethereum's smart contracts, DeFi developers can build decentralized applications that allow financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading to occur without traditional intermediaries, enhancing efficiency and accessibility.\n\nTo put it simply, Ethereum is the undisputed leader in the DeFi space, with over 60% of the DeFi economy built on its blockchain. And with DeFi as one of the most prominent and innovative use cases of crypto, as DeFi grows, so should Ethereum.\n\nDeFi is just one (great) example of how Ethereum fosters innovation and experimentation. The recent advancements in tokenizing real-world assets demonstrate Ethereum's capacity to stay at the forefront of blockchain technology. Investing in Ethereum is essentially investing in the future potential of blockchain experimentation and development. As more projects and applications are built on Ethereum, its value proposition will continue to strengthen for decades to come."

        "content": "Ethereum Price: Over the past two weeks, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum witnessed shrunk volatility carrying a consolidation trend above $3600. The daily chart projecting short body candles and rejection on both sides indicates a lack of direction among market participants. Will the BTC price drop below $70000 push a prolonged correction in the altcoin market?\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Prices Today June 8: Bitcoin & ETH Take Bearish Turn, Wormhole & INJ Pump\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Defend Key Support Amid Broader Uncertainty\n\nDuring mid-May, the Ethereum price rebounded sharply from the $2860 support indicating the investor continued to accumulate this asset at market dips. The renewed buying force uplifted the ETH value by 39% to reach a 10-week high of $3975.\n\nHowever, with broader market uncertainty the recovery momentum in Ether stalled resulting in a sideways action above $3630. This support coinciding closely with the 20-day EMA slope and 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level creates a high area of interest for buyers.\n\nThe notable rejection of candle tails at this support indicates the buyers are defending this support. For risk-averse traders, a breakout above the overhead resistance of $4090 will give a better confirmation of a prolonged rally.\n\nWith sustained buying, the Ethereum price prediction hints at a rally to challenge the ATH (All-time-high) resistance of $4880.\n\nOn a contrary note, a breakdown below $3630 will accelerate the selling pressure and may extend the current correction for a week or month.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Selloff: Here\u2019s Why Bitcoin, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE Prices Slips Today\n\nHistorical Trends Show June\u2019s Mixed Fortunes for Ethereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s price performance in June has shown significant volatility over the past years, with both notable gains and sharp declines. The largest drop occurred in 2022 with a steep decline of -44.79%, while the highest gain was in 2017 at +26.19%.\n\nOn average, June tends to yield negative returns, with an average of -6.76% and a median of -2.53%. This negative bias suggests that June is often a challenging month for Ethereum. However, the data also hints at the potential for sharp reversals, as seen in the positive return of +8.86% in 2019 following a significant drop of -21.34% in 2018.\n\nThese variations are likely influenced by broader market conditions, including macroeconomic factors and regulatory news. Given this historical performance, investors might approach June with caution.\n\nHowever, with steady development for the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs, the market is better leaning in buyers\u2019 favor.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The Ethereum price trading above the daily EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the path to least resistance is upward.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The downtick in ADX slope at 33% indicates the current consolidation could assist buyers in recuperating exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Why Ethereum Layer-2 Network Taiko Is Spending $100K Daily on Blobs - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn Ethereum layer-2 network named Taiko is dominating the market for so-called blobs, or dedicated data storage for Ethereum scalers\u2014but those endeavors are resulting in tens of thousands of dollars worth of costs for the little-known scaling solution each and every day, even topping the $100,000 mark multiple times this week.\n\nThe Taiko protocol, which went live in late May, seeks to offer users cheaper and faster transactions than on Ethereum's mainnet, while borrowing elements of the network's security. Since going live, Taiko has spent a whopping $900,000 on blobs in less than two weeks to funnel users\u2019 transactions over to Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiko\u2019s competitors, such as the Optimism network, rarely spend more than $1,000 per day on Blob-related fees. Introduced in March as part of an Ethereum upgrade, blobs were billed as a new resource for layer-2 scaling networks to post Ethereum transactions more cheaply.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s maker Taiko Labs announced in March that it had raised $15 million in a Series A funding round. Leveraging \u201czero-knowledge\u201d cryptography in its design, Taiko is striving to differentiate its scaling design in an increasingly competitive field that includes dozens of different scaling networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTaiko just launched its mainnet, and there\u2019s a lot to be figured out before it becomes stable,\u201d Taiko Labs CEO Daniel Wang told Decrypt in a written statement. \u201cWe knew that we will use more blobs than other layer-2s. This is a design decision, not a bug.\u201d\n\nLayer-2 networks often work by bundling batches of transactions together and processing them on a separate chain before posting receipts back to Ethereum. However, Taiko\u2019s design differs from that formula, where lots of transactions are rolled up into batches elsewhere.\n\nInstead, the process of ordering transactions, known as sequencing, takes place on Ethereum itself. In a blog post, Taiko Labs said this process, dubbed \u201cbase sequencing,\u201d is more decentralized than that of other layer-2s that rely on centralized sequencers\u2014which are controlled by a network\u2019s development team and collect a small portion of users\u2019 fees.\n\n\u201cThat sounds expensive,\u201d Alexei Zamyatin, the co-founder of Bitcoin layer-2 network BOB, told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cIt makes it more secure, but not as secure as [Ethereum], and you\u2019re also much more expensive than most layer-2s.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA game of tradeoffs\n\nStill, Wang stated that the costs associated with Taiko\u2019s functionality could easily reach the point of break-even if \u201cTaiko is fully utilized by users,\u201d providing a sustainable amount of gas fees.\n\nWang added that Taiko is fully aware of the pros and cons associated with its sequencing method, and he hopes that Ethereum researchers will study Taiko\u2019s on-chain data to explore improvements that could allow Ethereum to better support similar scaling networks.\n\nSome Ethereum researchers, including Justin Drake, believe that Taiko\u2019s team is trailblazing a new form of decentralized sequencing that could solve key hurdles in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt is making a leap forward in the decentralization, credible neutrality, and composability of rollups,\u201d he told Decrypt in a written statement.\n\nIf more layer-2 networks shifted the sequencing of their transactions to Ethereum itself, then fragmentation issues holding the entire space back could be solved, he stated. As of now, liquidity and assets are largely spread out across different layer-2s, effectively siloing users and applications within a given scaling solution while all being tied to Ethereum.\n\nWhen it comes to layer-2 networks on Ethereum, the introduction of blobs represented a significant shift in how those protocols interact with the underlying blockchain. Before blobs were available as a separate fee market, layer-2s could only post bundled transactions in the form of Ethereum \u201ccalldata,\u201d a space for data to be contained within transactions.\n\nInstead of trafficking users\u2019 transactions in bulk alongside regular Ethereum activity, blobs serve almost as a dedicated lane on a highway, where less congestion can reduce costs. However, the best way to package those transactions before they\u2019re shipped is still up for debate.\n\nBlobs blobs blobs\n\nIn some cases, centralized sequencers can be leveraged to grind a network to a halt, puncturing the veil of permissionless activity that is synonymous with crypto. Sometimes, centralized sequencers can be abused to delay transactions too. However, Taiko\u2019s commitment to decentralization may not be the most efficient, according to one of its community advocates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSadly, it\u2019s kind of expensive,\u201d the pseudonymous crypto researcher arixon.eth said on Twitter (aka X). \u201cBecause of based sequencing, we need to post a blob every 12 [seconds], and if there aren't enough [transactions], then we just won't fill the blobs.\u201d\n\nBecause of based sequencing, we need to post a blob every 12s and if there aren't enough txs then we just won't fill the blobs Sadly it's kinda expensive, so we really need based preconfs \u2014 arixon.eth (@arixoneth) June 1, 2024\n\nWang of Taiko Labs said changing this pace could be a potential solution enacted soon, stating that Taiko\u2019s community is \u201cconsidering lowering the block proposing frequency a bit.\u201d\n\nThe constant stream of blobs, regardless of how full they are, has made Taiko a top user of them. On Sunday, for example, Taiko posted 25% of all blobs on Ethereum, according to a popular Dune dashboard. That day, Taiko spent nearly $63,000 on blob-related fees.\n\nOn Thursday, Taiko paid $123,000 in fees for blobs\u2014representing 73% of all costs paid for them across layer-2s\u2014which was its second straight day with a six-figure fee tally. And while most layer-2s pass cost savings onto their users through lower fees, the premium Taiko is paying for decentralization, as of now, isn\u2019t a bill that users need to foot.\n\n\u201cFor now, it's partially subsidized by the team,\u201d arixon.eth said, adding that the process could be modified in the future so that \u201cblocks are missed until there are enough [transactions] in the mempool for a proposer to push a block to [Ethereum] profitably.\u201d\n\nAmid the network\u2019s first airdrop on Wednesday of TAIKO tokens, the network\u2019s native cryptocurrency, the layer-2 averaged around 6.42 transactions per second, according to L2BEAT. Meanwhile, Ethereum registered around 13.6 transactions per second itself.\n\nSo far, the performance of Taiko\u2019s token has been turbulent. After crashing 40% an hour after it launched, to $2.27 from $3.80, the token\u2019s price had recovered to $2.45, as of this writing, showing a nearly 3% decrease over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Ethereum leaders faces criticism for trying to merge capitalist and social goals.\n\nShare this article\n\nEvgeny Gaevoy, CEO of Wintermute, said if Ethereum fails in the future, it will not be because of technical shortcomings compared to competitors like Solana. Instead, the core issue is the contradiction in Ethereum\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cIf ETH fails in the future it [won\u2019t] be because \u2018Solana is faster\u2019, it will be because the [ETH] \u2018elite\u2019 is still stuck in a massive contradiction,\u201d Gaevoy stated in a recent post on X.\n\nHis remarks come as a response to the controversy that erupted following Vitalik Buterin\u2019s critique of celebrity memecoins. According to Buterin, projects should aim to deliver societal value and leave participants content, rather than focus on enriching celebrities and early investors.\n\nButerin\u2019s stance drew a sharp rebuke from hip-hop artist Iggy Azalea, who recently launched her own memecoin, MOTHER. She posted a meme showing her holding a baby that resembled Buterin.\n\nAzalea\u2019s photo prompted Uniswap Labs co-founder Hayden Adams to defend Buterin\u2019s role.\n\nHe criticized Azalea for downplaying Buterin\u2019s contributions to the crypto community, expressing disappointment that instead of reacting positively and using profits to support social causes, the singer chose to mock Buterin.\n\nNo issues with memecoins or celebcoins \u2013 I think there\u2019s value to memetic attention and it\u2019s cool to create markets for it That said, the underlying purpose and value of the tech goes way beyond financial games. And the best builders in the space are motivated by positive social\u2026 https://t.co/FQhawNl7GP \u2014 Hayden Adams \ud83e\udd84 (@haydenzadams) June 6, 2024\n\nThat was when the Wintermute CEO jumped into the debate and criticized Ethereum\u2019s leadership. He argued that Ethereum leaders are attempting to create a capitalist blockchain system while simultaneously addressing social issues\u2014a stance he sees as inherently contradictory.\n\n\u201cYou are either building capitalism or planned socialism. I\u2019m sorry, you really [can\u2019t] have both,\u201d Gaevoy added.\n\nGaevoy\u2019s comments sparked controversy among crypto members. Many disagreed with his view, saying that being against celeb memecoins does not equate to building a socialist system.\n\nNot sure how Hayden and Vitalik saying how they don't like certain trends means they are against capitalism (or aren't involved in building capitalist systems anymore) They both have a certain vision of crypto, in terms of the types of things people will build and what people\u2026 \u2014 Mike van Rossum (@mikevanrossum) June 6, 2024\n\nExcuse me, but in what way Vitalik or Hayden are building socialism? Being against obvious rug pulls != building socialism \u2014 DeFi Made Here (@DeFi_Made_Here) June 6, 2024\n\nIn response to these disagreements, Gaevoy said it all came down to the underlying principle.\n\nAccording to him, if capitalism is the foundation, integrating features to mitigate its negative impacts is beneficial. However, if the primary goal is \u201csocial justice\u201d or creating \u201conly good things,\u201d capitalism should not be an afterthought.\n\nTo me its about the primary guiding principle. If you key guiding principle is capitalism and then you make extra steps to make it less damaging \u2013 I'm all for it. If your guiding principle is, idk, \"social justice\" or \"only good things should be built\" and then you attach\u2026 \u2014 wishful cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) June 6, 2024"

        "content": "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart called for freedom of information access (FOIA) requests regarding the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn a June 5 KITCO interview, Seyffart said that public requests should search for \u201cemails, calls, [and] anyone that had conversations with [SEC chair] Gary Gensler\u201d to determine what happened during the SEC\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nHe said unused denial orders could exist due to the agency\u2019s rapid change in stance.\n\nVoting is unclear\n\nSeyffart said the SEC approved the spot Ethereum ETFs through delegated authority, a common approach but a rare choice for the issue at hand.\n\nDelegated authority also means voting records are unclear.\n\nSeyffart said that the choice points to a politically motivated decision, stating:\n\n\u201cUntil I have somebody come out and show me smoking gun evidence \u2026 this was political.\u201d\n\nSeyffart said the \u201cleading theory\u201d is that a Biden administration member called SEC chair Gary Gensler and influenced the agency\u2019s decision.\n\nA secondary theory posits that someone swung the vote of a Democratic SEC commissioner who previously voted against spot Bitcoin ETFs. The reversed vote could have led the SEC to vote at least 3-2 in favor of spot Ethereum ETFs even if Gensler voted against the funds.\n\nIt is still possible for a commissioner to challenge the decision and force a vote. However, Seyffart said Democratic commissioners are unlikely to gain anything from making the voting record transparent.\n\nHe previously said a challenge is unlikely to influence the actual voting results.\n\nSEC should be less political\n\nSeyffart also discussed the broader impact of politics on the SEC. He argued the SEC should not be wholly apolitical but less political than it currently is.\n\nSeyffart believes that, until recently, the SEC has decided to deny spot crypto ETFs and proceeded to find legal justification for its stance after the fact.\n\nInstead, the chair should choose the issues the agency focuses on and seek legal input from individual commissioners, leading to a decision \u201cbased on logic and reason,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s current decline signaled a cooling-off from its recent highs\n\nDerivative data pointed to continued market interest.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seems to have come off its ETF hype-induced rally as bulls have started to take a hike.\n\nAt press time, the largest altcoin in the world has seen a decrease of 3.7% over the past day and 2.5% over the past week as the market awaits the approval of the S-1 forms for the ETFs. So, is the rally over already?\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of TradingView saw that Ethereum has been unable to maintain its highs and is now consolidating at lower levels.\n\nThe Moving Averages (MA50 in blue and MA200 in red) indicated a cooling-off period.\n\nInitially, the price surged above both moving averages in a strong bullish move but has since declined and is now trading below these key indicators, as we see a shift to bearish momentum in the short term.\n\nThe RSI, sitting around 45, also indicated a lack of strong buying momentum, with values leaning more toward the oversold territory, but not conclusively so.\n\nEthereum\u2019s social volume has also declined significantly, suggesting that public interest in and sentiment toward the altcoin are low.\n\nThis reduction in social engagement could be contributing to the decrease in Ethereum\u2019s price, as less discussion might correlate with reduced trading activity and demand.\n\nInterestingly, the trading volume of Ethereum\u2019s derivatives market has sharply increased by over 70%, meaning there is heightened market engagement.\n\nNotably, the long/short ratio across different platforms also shows more bullish sentiment on platforms like Binance [BNB] and OKX.\n\nWhat Ethereum\u2019s future holds\n\nThe on-chain data for Ethereum presented a predominantly bullish scenario. 89% of holders are currently making money at the present price, indicating a strong upward trend that has benefited the majority.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe significant concentration of the token by large holders (51%) suggested that while there was potential for high volatility due to possible large-scale sell-offs, the market was stable, with these major holders likely maintaining their positions.\n\nOverall, Ethereum bulls seem to be cooling off temporarily, likely due to the latest US jobs data. But the rally is not over yet."

        "content": "Shiba Inu could breach the $0.00014 price level if it trails Ethereum price in the event that ETH clinches the $22,000 target predicted by VanEck.\n\nVanEck Sees Ethereum at $22,000 by 2030\n\nFor context, leading asset manager VanEck recently adjusted its outlook for Ethereum, proposing a possible six times increase in price per unit and a $66 billion cash flow. As reported by The Crypto Basic, VanEck\u2019s latest projection was fueled by the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. SEC.\n\nWith these investment products poised to introduce greater capital to the Ethereum market, industry experts believe this development could bolster Ethereum\u2019s price, triggering a spike to greater heights. This phenomenon was recently observed with the recently-introduced spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen a cumulative net inflow of $15.69 billion since January.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe inflows to these instruments contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s spike to a new all-time high above $73,000 three months back. Considering these events, analysts at VanEck believe Ethereum could record similar gains. As a result, they project a $22,000 price target by 2030, the next six years.\n\nShiba Inu Price if It Trails ETH Surge\n\nMeanwhile, we recently assessed how much Shiba Inu could rise if it trails Ethereum on the back of this price surge. Notably, data from IntoTheBlock indicates that SHIB boasts some level of price correlation with Ethereum, with a 30-day correlation of 69%, as reported by The Crypto Basic earlier this week.\n\nThis suggests that Shiba Inu could follow Ethereum\u2019s price movements to an extent as ETH journeys to the $22,000 price goal. Remarkably, for Ethereum to reach this $22,000 value, it would have to spike by 494% from its current price of $3,700. Also, this $22,000 price would lead to an ETH market cap of $2.64 trillion.\n\nIf Shiba Inu records similar gains, its price could rally to unprecedented highs. SHIB currently changes hands at $0.00002394, having slumped by 5% over the last 24 hours to break below the $0.000025 support. A similar 494% increase from this point would take Shiba Inu to $0.0001423, leading to a new all-time high for the token.\n\nInterestingly, market analyst Rafaela Rigo already predicted a Shiba Inu rally to this price territory. Last month, Rafaela called attention to a possible repetition of the 2021 pattern, suggesting that SHIB has the potential to reach $0.0001406. At a $0.000014 price, Shiba Inu\u2019s market cap would sit at $83.5 billion, a feasible target."

        "content": "In a recent interview, Matthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s Digital Asset Research Chief, discussed the significant regulatory progress and future prospects surrounding the firm\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF. On May 23, the SEC approved a rule change that could pave the way for Spot Ether ETFs, marking a \u201cregulatory 180 in recent SEC history.\u201d Moreover, now the VanEck exec has revealed the ETF issuer\u2019s next move in the approval of Ether ETFs.\n\nVanEck Confident On Spot Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nThe recent approval indicates that Ethereum is recognized as a commodity. Furthermore, Sigel described this development as \u201ctremendously bullish for the prospect of innovation happening on open-source blockchains.\u201d In addition, Sigel emphasized that this regulatory shift could herald a new era of blockchain activity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe also highlighted that 2024 has already seen record highs in various metrics. These include the number of blockchain addresses interacting, the volume of transactions, and user fees. Sigel noted, \u201cIt\u2019s great news. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both up more than 60% this year,\u201d according to a CNBC interview.\n\nMoreover, VanEck has been at the forefront of these developments, being the first traditional ETF issuer to file for a Bitcoin ETF in 2017 and a Spot Ethereum ETF subsequently. Sigel expressed optimism that VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF could be among the first to trade among its rivals. He stated, \u201cI still hope and expect that the VanEck Ethereum ETF, if it\u2019s approved, will trade first.\u201d\n\nThe next critical step involves the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs\u2019 S-1 filings. Sigel explained, \u201cTo list one of these ETFs, it\u2019s like a nuclear code: you need two keys\u2014the 19b-4 and the S-1. We\u2019ll have to wait and respond to the agency\u2019s comments if there are any, and we\u2019re hopeful that these products can be trading in a matter of weeks.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: VanEck Advisor Slams TradFi Over GameStop Saga, Hails Bitcoin\n\nImplications On Ether & Crypto Market\n\nWhen asked about the broader implications for Ethereum, Sigel revealed a bullish forecast, projecting Ethereum could generate over $70 billion in free cash flow to token holders by 2030, supporting a coin price of $22,000. This forecast reflects a more constructive view of the political landscape and the recent boom in users transacting on the network due to Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap.\n\nIn addition, the VanEck exec also touched on the transformative potential of crypto assets. He noted, \u201cThis is an open-source app store with the potential to take significant margin away from the big tech platforms and also banking.\u201d The VanEck exec also emphasized the importance of educating traditional market participants about the real-world use cases of these assets.\n\nThe approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year has already opened up the market to a new class of buyers. These include registered investment advisors and pension funds, which could be a similar case for Ethereum ETFs if approved. Sigel pointed out, \u201cThe Spot ETFs have opened up an entirely new class of buyers, and we\u2019re seeing that market share gain continue.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Sigel acknowledged the political shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto, driven by significant industry lobbying efforts. He commented on the recent passing of the Fit for the 21st Century Act by the House. Sigel stated, \u201cIt lays the groundwork for a much more favorable environment next year.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: ETH/BTC Price Analysis: Why Ethereum Price Can Break Out to $5000\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin and crypto investors received a lot of good news this week, even though the market still can\u2019t manage to break free from its highs three months ago.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs absorbed net inflows of $887 million\u2014the second-best daily performance for the ETFs to date. The price of Bitcoin surged above $71,000 in the process, reaching its highest price since March.\n\nThat performance was followed by not one, but two high-profile Bitcoin ETF sponsors assuring investors that a second, much larger wave of institutions was coming to buy Bitcoin through the funds. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan wrote in a memo that crypto regulatory progress on Capitol Hill was untapped \u201calpha\u201d for investors, while Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson said the ETFs had only been touched by their \u201cfirst wave of the early adopters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJUST IN: Franklin Templeton CEO on #Bitcoin ETF adoption says \u201cThis is really the first wave of the early adopters. \u2026the next wave is the much bigger institutions.\u201d WATCH\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/G52jWUEetX \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) June 5, 2024\n\nAnd at least in the memecoin world, the bull market appeared to be back in full swing. Bitcoin\u2019s very first BRC-20 token, ORDI, surged by over 30% to $60 as of Friday, while PUPS and Bitcoin Wizards (WZRD) more than doubled in value intraweek, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nOther more popular memecoins like PEPE, BONK, and SHIB weren\u2019t as lucky, all posting losses this week.\n\nThe Solana-based meme coin GME seriously spiked, blasting up 467% at its height this week, building on the momentum of its stock market namesake Gamestop (GME). Meme influencer Roaring Kitty\u2014who sparked the Wall Street-confounding GameStop movement back in 2021\u2014gave the stock a second wind with his surprise returns to both YouTube and live streaming, with his net worth briefly edging toward $1 billion\u2014before a Friday cold shower from the game retailer.\n\nPerformance-wise, between Bitcoin and meme coins is Ethereum, which kept pace with Bitcoin\u2019s gains this week as its progressed toward a spot ETF launch. VanEck analysts posted a lengthy report arguing that ETH will reach $22,000 per unit by 2030, after sucking away financial market share from Apple, Google, and big banks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, with both the Bank of Canada and European Central Bank lowering interest rates this week, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes told followers that it was officially time to start apeing into Bitcoin and shitcoins.\n\nYet his call may have been a tad premature: at the end the week, a liquidation cascade on Friday sent Bitcoin crashing from $71,000 to $68,000, and ETH down from $3,800 to $3,600. Meanwhile, GME\u2014both the stock and the memecoin\u2014cratered by over 35% each.\n\nRoaring Kitty is the greatest business communicator since Steve Jobs. Dude shows up 30 minutes to the livestream. Builds the tension up to 11. Shows up on the livestream in a fake bandage and cast. And the first thing he says is \u201coh shit\u201d. pic.twitter.com/YlTesdxJGB \u2014 Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan) June 7, 2024\n\nBitcoin is trading for $69,335 as of writing, while Ethereum is priced at $3,686. The price of the GME meme coin has once again settled near $0.014.\n\nPrices current as of 3am ET on June 8, 2024. Edited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "With a little digging, it's easy to see why Ethereum is a top choice.\n\nIf you've got $1,000 to invest that you don't need for anything else in the short or medium term, and are looking at the cryptocurrency market, there are literally thousands of options. However, based on a combination of fundamentals and recent developments, Ethereum (ETH 0.21%) stands out from the crowd.\n\nThere are several compelling reasons why the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency is deserving of your $1,000, but three stand out above the rest: regulatory acceptance, its deflationary nature, and its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nRegulatory acceptance looms\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved applications from several firms looking to launch the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This paves the way for these firms to submit their S-1 forms, which would then allow the ETFs to go live. These ETFs are expected to become available for trading sometime in late June or July.\n\nHaving spot ETFs is a game changer for democratizing access to Ethereum. It will mean that investors can purchase Ethereum through a traditional brokerage account, eliminating the need to navigate often complex and intimidating crypto exchanges. This ease of access will likely attract a broader range of investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto market.\n\nThe most significant impact, however, is the potential influx of institutional investors. Until now, many institutional investors have been wary of directly investing in cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, primarily due to regulatory uncertainties and the lack of a straightforward investment vehicle.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs removes these barriers, allowing institutions with deep pockets to participate in the market. This probable influx of institutional capital could put significant upward pressure on Ethereum's price, similar to what we saw with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) following approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs early this year. In the months after the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched, they were buying Bitcoin at 10 times the daily production rate, driving its price to a new all-time high. If things unfold in a similar fashion, Ethereum could experience a similarly explosive boost.\n\nDeflationary dynamics\n\nWith a new set of buyers entering the market, Ethereum's price could benefit even more than Bitcoin's thanks to a crucial upgrade the blockchain received in 2021: the London hard fork. This upgrade introduced a mechanism that makes Ethereum deflationary by burning a portion of the transaction fees. Essentially, every time a transaction is processed, a small amount of ether is permanently removed from circulation.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Ethereum does not have a supply maximum. However, the deflationary mechanism introduced by the London hard fork means that, under the right conditions, more ether is burned than is created, reducing the overall supply. This burning mechanism is particularly effective during periods of high network activity, as more transactions result in more ether being burned.\n\nBitcoin is often lauded for its low inflation rate, but it is worth noting that Ethereum's inflation rate is currently lower. Since the London hard fork went live, Ethereum's inflation rate is approximately -0.18%, meaning that its supply is actually decreasing.\n\nThe pending launch of Ethereum ETFs could significantly alter the supply and demand dynamics, potentially sending its price even higher. Increased demand from ETF purchases, coupled with the deflationary effect of the burn mechanism, creates a perfect storm for price appreciation.\n\nThe DeFi champion\n\nIf the pending launch of ETFs and the deflationary nature of Ethereum are not enough to persuade you to invest, consider Ethereum's undisputed leadership in the DeFi space. More than 60% of the DeFi market is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which is not just a statistic but a testament to its foundational role in the future of finance.\n\nDeFi represents a revolutionary shift, transforming how financial services are delivered by eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. Instead of relying on banks or other financial institutions, DeFi platforms offer services such as lending, borrowing, and trading directly through blockchain technology. Ethereum's robust smart-contract capabilities make it the perfect platform for these applications, enabling secure, transparent, and automated transactions without the need for a trusted third party.\n\nThe significance of Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space cannot be overstated. As more DeFi applications are built on Ethereum, the network's utility and value increase. This growing ecosystem creates a positive feedback loop: The more users and developers who participate, the more valuable and indispensable the Ethereum network becomes. This network effect not only enhances Ethereum's current value but also ensures its long-term potential as the backbone of decentralized finance. As DeFi continues to expand and integrate with traditional financial systems, Ethereum's pivotal role will likely drive substantial and sustained growth."

        "content": "A major whale sold part of its ETH holdings\n\nAltcoin\u2019s price fell, while Ethereum\u2019s network growth declined too\n\nEthereum [ETH]\u2018s price registered a massive hike over the last few weeks, one fueled by news of new spot ETFs for ETH. Despite the optimism around the network, however, a large whale recently decided to sell its holdings.\n\nWhales shy away\n\nOn 8 June, a significant transaction occurred on the Ethereum blockchain. A major whale transferred 15,200 ETH, worth approximately $56.47 million, to Kraken. This particular address received massive holdings of 67,000 ETH directly from the Ethereum Foundation. It is further believed that this same address also received an initial 200,000 ETH during the Ethereum Genesis block, likely signifying participation in the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) that launched the Ethereum network.\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that despite this recent transfer, the wallet still holds a balance of 41,000 ETH \u2013 Valued at approximately $151 million.\n\nThis large transaction may be interpreted by some investors as a sign that the whale is losing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future, prompting it to sell its holdings. This fear-based selling could trigger a domino effect, driving the price down further.\n\nAdditionally, the unknown purpose behind the transfer can spur further uncertainty.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,683.83, with its price down by 3.14% in the last 24 hours. Despite this sudden dip in ETH\u2019s price, however, the overall trend of the price movement looked relatively positive.\n\nAnd yet, the network growth for ETH declined significantly over the last few days, implying that new addresses were losing interest in ETH and were not ready to buy ETH at the current rate. If the price dips further, there may be a chance that ETH may begin to look lucrative to new investors in the future.\n\nCoupled with the declining network growth, the velocity at which ETH was trading also fell materially.\n\nIn terms of overall activity on the network, gas usage on the Ethereum network declined over the last few days. Additionally, the overall NFT trades on the network plummeted as well.\n\nThe lack of activity on the Ethereum ecosystem can be detrimental to both the the network and the price of ETH in the long run.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

While its final agenda and activation date are still being discussed, Pectra is expected to be among the most radical upgrades of the Ethereum (ETH) design.\n\nEthereum Pectra upgrade to replace AA and changes game in staking\n\nEthereum (ETH) developers agreed about at least five of Ethereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs that will be included in the Pectra upgrade. The list was shared by Anthony Sassano, independent Ethereum (ETH) researcher and educationist.\n\nEIP-7702 is set to replace Ethereum's (ETH) current Account Abstraction mechanism, ERC 4337. It will advance the way Ethereum (ETH) accounts are performing activity of smart contracts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEIP-7594 \"Peer Data Availability Sampling\" will upgrade the scaling opportunities of Ethereum's L2 rollups. EIP-7251 \"MaxEB\" will raise the limit of stake in Ethereum (ETH) PoS and introduce triggerable exits for its participants.\n\nEIP-2537 is set to add functionality to efficiently perform operations over the BLS12-381 curve, including those for BLS signature verification, as per EF main GitHub repository.\n\nLast but not least, EIP-7549 will make consensus voting procedures more efficient by reducing the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules.\n\nPectra hard fork expected to be activated in Q1, 2025\n\nSassano added that right now the history expiry function is being considered for inclusion in the next hard fork. Meanwhile, hotly anticipated Verkle Trees will likely be added in Osaka, the first post-Pectra hard fork.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) veteran concluded that his particular estimation for the Pectra activation date is Q1, 2025, while in some sources, community enthusiasts also discuss Q4, 2024, as a potential timeline.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Prague-Electra upgrade specifications were introduced to the community in January 2024."

        "content": "Transactions on Litecoin increased across all levels, leaving Ethereum trailing\n\nETH and LTC prices fell in the last 24 hours, but they might surpass major milestones soon\n\nIt is unusual to find Litecoin [LTC] surpassing Ethereum [ETH] at any level. However, on 6 June, the number of active addresses on Litecoin\u2019s network jumped by a mind-blowing 75%.\n\nAccording to data from IntoTheBlock, the difference was over 100,000 in favor of Litecoin. In total, the figure was 602,720 and represented the highest level of activity on the network since January.\n\nAfter Cardano, Litecoin takes Ethereum out\n\nFor context, active addresses measure the number of unique wallets engaged in successful transactions on a blockchain. A few days ago, the coin had registered higher values than Cardano [ADA] on the same front.\n\nHowever, it is important to mention that most of the transactions emanated from wallets with a small balance.\n\nThat being said, those holding LTC worth $10,000 to $10 million were not left out. According to IntoTheBlock\u2019s latest post on X,\n\n\u201cWhile most of the increase is due to transactions smaller than $10, there is a noticeable rise in transactions of all sizes.\u201d\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that the rise in network activity did not trigger a hike in LTC\u2019s price. At press time, Litecoin was valued at at $83.52, following a fall of 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, was trading at $3,791, with the altcoin depreciating slightly too. Additionally, AMBCrypto looked at Litecoin\u2019s market cap to thermocap ratio. This metric measures a cryptocurrency\u2019s valuation relative to the total security spend by miners. When the market cap to thermocap ratio spikes, it means the coin is trading at a premium when compared to miner spend. In this instance, the price could be termed overvalued.\n\nHistorically, as shown below, an extremely high reading of the metric causes a correction. However, at press time, the ratio was 0.00000003. This was a low reading, compared to periods when Litecoin has been overheated.\n\nAre LTC and ETH at a discount?\n\nSimply put, LTC may be trading at a discount . Should the market return to a highly bullish state, the price of LTC could move past $100 from its press time position.\n\nTo confirm this thesis, AMBCrypto examined the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric track the profitability of holders in relation to coin valuation.\n\nAt press time, Litecoin\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was 13.35%, indicating that the average holder would make profits if they sell. However, the gains might be high enough to trigger widespread profit-taking.\n\nFor Ethereum, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 4.69%. While this suggested that ETH and LTC may be in similar spots, it also addressed the notion that Litecoin holders might be in a better position than their Ethereum counterparts."

With the price failing to surge upward, we might see another period of consolidation where the moving average could catch up with the massive volatility witnessed a few weeks ago and potentially provide some ground for a rally continuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince this level has been a crucial area of support for ETH, the recent decline below $3,700 is especially raising some concerns and questions. If it breaks below, it may indicate that bulls need to reorganize as bears are becoming more powerful.\n\nSharp swings in price action are characteristic of a volatile asset like Ethereum. Based on the current trend, it appears that ETH is having difficulty keeping up its upward momentum.\n\nEthereum went through a consolidation phase, fluctuating between support and resistance levels, as the chart illustrates following a significant rally. This type of activity typically occurs before a notable change in price either upward or downward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA deeper drop toward the 200-day MA, a more reliable measure of the direction of the long-term trend, could occur if it is unable to hold. In the near run, this might entail increased downside risk. An additional important consideration is volume.\n\nHigher-than-average trading volumes were seen along with the recent decline, suggesting that sellers are more active. This could indicate that more traders are cutting their positions, which would put more pressure on the price to decline. The RSI, on the other hand, is circling around neutral. This shows that Ethereum has room to recover if the mood of the market turns around, and it is neither overbought nor oversold."

        "content": "The Ethereum price, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw a steep decline today amid a widespread crypto market selloff. Meanwhile, this drop comes in the wake of stronger-than-expected U.S. job data, which has dampened investor sentiment over a hawkish stance by the Federal Reserve.\n\nHowever, despite the downturn, some analysts are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s potential for a significant rebound.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalyst Predicts 13% Ethereum Price Rally\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s recent price dip, a prominent crypto market analyst, known as Mags (@thescalpingpro) on the X platform, anticipates a strong recovery. In a recent X post, Mags compared the current Ethereum price trend to historical patterns, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could experience a significant rally soon. According to Mags, Ethereum is \u201cforming a similar structure\u201d to a previous cycle, after which the crypto has soared 13%.\n\nNotably, Mags\u2019 analysis indicates that Ethereum might reach up to $4,200 if the predicted trend holds true. Currently, Ethereum is trading near $3,700, and this potential rally would represent a 13% increase. This optimistic forecast is based on Ethereum\u2019s historical performance, where similar patterns have led to substantial gains.\n\nMeanwhile, supporting this outlook, Mags shared a price chart showing Ethereum\u2019s current structure, highlighting similarities to past cycles. The comparison suggests that the recent decline might be a precursor to a strong upward movement, akin to previous instances where Ethereum rallied significantly after a similar setup.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Foundation Wallet Deposits $56 Million in ETH on Kraken, ETH Price Drop Soon?\n\nPrice Amid Contrastive Views\n\nWhile Mags presents a bullish outlook, not all experts share the same optimism. A recent report from 10X Research has introduced a more cautious perspective. According to their analysis, Ethereum has broken a critical support level of $3,725. This breach has sparked concerns about potential ETH liquidations.\n\nThe 10X Research report highlights the risk of imminent liquidations following Ethereum\u2019s drop below the key support level. Supporting this view, data from CoinGlass shows that Ethereum has experienced significant liquidations over the past 24 hours.\n\nSpecifically, $59.61 million worth of Ethereum has been liquidated, with $52.23 million in long positions and $7.37 million in short positions. This data underscores the market\u2019s volatility and the potential risks associated with Ethereum\u2019s current price level.\n\nHowever, despite that, optimism prevails with soaring optimism over the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF. In addition, some market experts believe that the recent decline in the ETH price could provide a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nAs of writing, Ethereum price fell 3.21% to $3,683.75, while its trading volume over the last 24 hours soared 40.27% to $18.08 billion. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Open Interest fell 0.95% to $16.54 billion, reflecting the current gloomy sentiment hovering in the market.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s supply spiked last month.\n\nThis has happened due to a decline in daily active addresses on the network.\n\n46,138 Ethereum [ETH] worth around $176.22 million, at the altcoin\u2019s press time price, have been added to circulation in the last month, pushing the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply to a 30-day high of 120.14 million ETH, data from Ultrasound.money has shown.\n\nThe steady surge in the number of ETH coins in circulation means the altcoin\u2019s supply is currently inflationary. This happens when the network witnesses a decline in user activity.\n\nAMBCrypto confirmed this decline, as data from Artemis revealed a decrease in the daily count of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum blockchain in the past 30 days.\n\nAccording to the on-chain data provider, as of 5 June, 361,200 addresses completed at least one single transaction on Ethereum. This represented a 14% drop from the 421,000 unique addresses transacting on the network on 8th May.\n\nIn fact, during the period under review, the count of daily active addresses plummeted to a three-month low of 326,200 on 2nd June.\n\nAccording to Artemis\u2019 data, the last time the daily count of the number of Ethereum\u2019s active addresses was this low was on 8th February.\n\nInterestingly, due to the 25% spike in ETH\u2019s value during the period under review, total transaction fees on the Ethereum network did not decline.

This makes it the second blockchain, after Arbitrum [ARB], among the top 5 networks by TVL to record the most growth during that period.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $66.33 billion at press time, a year-to-date high and its highest level since May 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sector has not recorded the same success during the period under review. According to CryptoSlam, NFT sales volume on Ethereum has cratered by 56% in the past 30 days."

        "content": "Exchange supply for UNI increase while it dropped on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nA declining sentiment, set off by decreasing demand, indicated that ETH could slide to $9.20 in the short term.\n\nFor the last seven days, Uniswap\u2019s [UNI] price and Ethereum [ETH] have failed to move in the same direction. At press time, UNI changed hands at $9.98, representing a 2.22% increase in the last seven days.\n\nETH\u2019s price, on the other hand, was $3,687. This was a 2.56% decrease within the same period. However, that is not the major issue at hand.\n\nSomething AMBCrypto observed using on-chain data from Glassnode was that the tides could soon change.\n\nThe correlation goes off\n\nEvidence of this was reflected in the Exchange Net Position Change. According to our analysis, Uniswap\u2019s Exchange Net Position Change was 733,683 on the 8th of June.\n\nThis metric is the total supply of tokens held in exchange wallets. If it is positive, it means that more tokens are going into exchanges, and this could lead to a price decrease.\n\nHowever, a negative reading suggests a surge in withdrawals, which could lower selling pressure. For UNI, the number of tokens held on exchanges has been increasing since the 3rd of June.\n\nTherefore, there is a high chance that the price of the token could lose hold on the $9 region if the supply remains positive. However, it was a different ball game for Ethereum.\n\nAn evaluation of the same metric with ETH indicated an increase in coins taken ofd exchanges. According to Glassnode, about 576,851 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges on the same day 733,683 UNI tokens flowed in.\n\nUNI is set to fall further\n\nTherefore, it is possible to see the price of UNI fall while ETH could be in line for a swift recovery.\n\nIf validated, this could be contrary to the price performance of the cryptocurrencies when the U.S. SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn the build-up to the announcement, ETH\u2019s price jumped, and UNI\u2019s connection with the blockchain ensured it followed in the same direction. But how low can UNI go this time?\n\nTo check the possible targets, AMBCrypto analyzed the Weighted Sentiment, which shows the perception market participants have around a project. At press time, the Weighted Sentiment was -0.173.\n\nThis negative reading suggests that most comments about Uniswap tilted toward the bearish side of things. Thus, demand for the token could drop, and could trigger a price decrease.\n\nIn addition, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z Score which was 27% a few days ago was down to 23.58%. When the MVRV Z Score is positive, it implies that the token is in a bull phase.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s UNI\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nOn the other hand, a negative ratio suggests that a fall into the bear cycle. However, the recent decrease does not mean that UNI is dropping into a bear phase. But it is a sign that the price could slip down the charts.\n\nBy the look of things, a drawdown to $9.20 seems quite possible."

        "content": "Sat 08 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nIn the dynamic world of crypto, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a significant step forward for institutional adoption and mainstream investment. Recently, attention has turned to Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, which analysts suggest may experience more moderate demand compared to their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts.\n\nCrypto: Ethereum ETFs Less Attractive than Bitcoin ETFs!\n\nJPMorgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, estimate that Ethereum ETFs could attract between $1 billion and $3 billion in net inflows by the end of the year. In stark contrast to the $15.3 billion amassed by Bitcoin ETFs. This modest forecast reflects a less broad recognition and acceptance of ETH compared to BTC crypto, which saw a rapid 169% increase in its price over the past year.\n\nJames Davies, CPO and founder of Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that the demand for Ether might be lower due to its relatively less established notoriety. Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, adds that \u201cEther does not have the profile of Bitcoin\u201d and points to BTC\u2019s market value of $1.4 trillion, which is three times that of Ether.\n\nLong-term Prospects of Ethereum\n\nDespite less enthusiastic anticipation, Ethereum ETFs offer unique advantages. \u201cETH has utility that is mostly absent in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so a large part of the overall crypto ecosystem is tied to ETH,\u201d says Davies, suggesting significant long-term growth potential. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, supports this view, stating that \u201cover time, we expect that investors will conclude that the application and innovation potential within the Ethereum ecosystem might be far greater than that of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, concerns remain regarding potential sell pressure due to the planned conversion of Grayscale\u2019s $11 billion Ethereum fund into an ETF. Davies warns that the \u201csell pressure\u201d on Ether resulting from redemptions in Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum fund could be significant. Nevertheless, he also notes that net inflows into BTC ETFs could potentially offset this pressure.\n\nFinally, while the potential demand for Ethereum ETFs appears promising, they are expected to attract significantly less interest compared to Bitcoin ETFs. Factors such as the absence of staking rewards and differences in market perceptions of crypto contribute to this outlook.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Should You Buy Solana Right Now While It's Below $200? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If Solana can convince investors it's the next Ethereum, it could skyrocket in value.\n\nIn 2023, Solana (SOL 0.81%) was one of the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, up an eye-popping 900%. In 2024, Solana has continued to turn in a stellar performance. At its current price of $165, Solana is up more than 60% through the first five months of the year.\n\nThe problem, however, is that Solana appears to be running into a wall right now. It is down nearly 20% since it hit an intra-year high of just over $200 in March. Should you view this as a potential buying opportunity, or as a warning sign that Solana's impressive recent gains could be coming to an end? Let's take a closer look.\n\nIs Solana the next Ethereum?\n\nThe primary reason to invest in Solana right now is that it could eventually become the next Ethereum (ETH 0.18%). Solana is a direct challenger to Ethereum in the Layer 1 blockchain space, and has been steadily gaining ground in every major niche, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For nearly four years, Solana has been tagged as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and now it finally seems to be delivering on its promise.\n\nCathie Wood of Ark Invest raved about Solana last year, calling it a faster, cheaper, and more efficient version of Ethereum. That's backed up by real numbers. Solana, for example, says it can process 50,000 transactions per second. Ethereum, by way of comparison, can only process 15 to 20 transactions per second. To achieve faster transaction processing speeds, Ethereum relies on a confusing mix of Layer 2 scaling solutions that even developers say is becoming too hard to use.\n\nSolana's secret weapon\n\nMoreover, Solana has a secret weapon that Ethereum simply cannot match: A mobile crypto strategy that is finally gaining traction with customers. Solana officially launched its new \"crypto phone\" (the Saga) last year. Early sales were weak, but a clever marketing promotion based around Solana meme coins has led to sales taking off.\n\nFrom the outset, Solana's mobile strategy was designed as a way to onboard new crypto users. The goal was to get a mobile phone into people's hands, give them plenty of apps they couldn't find anywhere else, and design new mobile experiences to make crypto easier to use. That, in turn, could result in people beating down the door to become part of the Solana blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAdmittedly, this might be a very long-term strategy. But it might just work. According to investment firm VanEck, all Solana needs is a single \"killer app\" with at least 100 million users, along the lines of a ChatGPT. If Solana can find a \"killer app\" for its mobile phone, it could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nVanEck ran the numbers and determined that, in a bull-case scenario, Solana might be worth over $3,200 by 2030. So, yes, if you buy into this analysis, you should be buying Solana while it's still below $200. At today's prices, you might be able to make a 20-fold return on your investment.\n\nThe case against Solana\n\nHowever, there are a number of reasons to be concerned about Solana. For example, the current bout of meme coin popularity taking over the Solana blockchain seems to be leading to some unsustainable performance. All of the improvement that we've been seeing in Solana's metrics -- such as new users, new unique wallets, and spikes in transaction activity -- might just be a lot of smoke and mirrors.\n\nMoreover, Solana continues to stand in Ethereum's shadow when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the end of May, the SEC granted approval for new spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading soon. If they are anywhere near as successful as the spot Bitcoin ETFs, they could lead to a huge influx of investor money flowing into Ethereum. That's fantastic for Ethereum holders, but it could act as a negative drag on Solana's price over the short to medium term. Money that otherwise might have gone into Solana will now be going into Ethereum.\n\nHow high can Solana go?\n\nThat being said, I'm taking a long-term approach when it comes to Solana. As Solana steadily gains market share at the expense of Ethereum, and as it continues to build out its mobile crypto strategy, I'm highly confident that it can continue to boost its valuation. Solana is still 36% below its all-time high of $260, which could be a reasonable near-term price target.\n\nIn a best-case scenario, of course, Solana will find the one \"killer app\" that it needs. If that happens, it could skyrocket in value and achieve what many have been predicting for several years now."
