        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Funds See Surge in Inflows Ahead of ETH Spot ETFs Trading\n\nAccording to CoinShares, global Bitcoin funds registered net inflows totaling $148 million last week. In contrast, short Bitcoin products saw outflows amounting to $3.5 million. Ethereum funds also attracted $33.5 million, marking the second consecutive week of positive inflows after a prolonged period of minimal activity.\n\n\u201cThis reflects a shift in investor sentiment for Ethereum, which had endured a 10-week stretch of outflows totaling $200 million,\u201d CoinShares noted. This renewed interest in Ethereum has also positively impacted Solana, which saw $5.8 million in inflows amid speculation about potential Solana ETFs and other altcoin products.\n\nWhile the majority of these inflows originated from the United States, significant crypto investments were also reported in Canada and Switzerland, where Ethereum maintains strong institutional support alongside Bitcoin.\n\nExperts are projecting that Ethereum ETFs could debut in July, potentially capturing about 20% of the demand seen by Bitcoin ETFs. \u201cSecuring 20% of Bitcoin ETF demand would signify an enormously successful launch by typical ETF standards,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented last week."

        "title": "All of Michael Saylor\u2019s Ethereum predictions were wrong - Protos",
        "content": "Michael Saylor has made a lot of predictions during his career. And because he became a billionaire in the process, many assume that his forecasts are generally accurate. For example, Bitcoiners applauded his support for \u2014 and multi-billion dollar purchases of \u2014 bitcoin. He invested at the right times and prices and has earned billions in profit. So when Saylor decided to place a bet on the future of Ethereum, millions listened.\n\nUnfortunately, Saylor got all of his predictions about Ethereum totally wrong.\n\nFirst, he predicted that the SEC would classify Ethereum as an unregistered security. At his corporate conference in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, he said, \u201cSometime this summer it will become very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a crypto asset security, not a commodity.\u201d\n\nSecond, Saylor predicted that US stock markets would never list a spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cIt will never be wrapped in a spot ETF. It will not be accepted by Wall Street; it will not be accepted by mainstream institutional investors.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that spot bitcoin ETFs would be the first and last type of spot cryptocurrency ETF. Pointing to the Bitcoin logo, he said, \u201cThis is the one, universal, consensus-accepted, institutional-grade crypto asset in the world. There won\u2019t be another one.\u201d\n\nEvery one of those predictions turned out to be wrong within five weeks.\n\nRead more: Michael Saylor dumps quarter billion worth of MSTR while hyping bitcoin\n\nSaylor lost all his bets on Ethereum\n\nDespite Joe Lubin\u2019s ConsenSys lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claiming that commissioners secretly classified Ethereum as a security in some redacted document, there\u2019s no public evidence that they have actually done so.\n\nRead more: ConsenSys says the SEC designated ETH a security but won\u2019t say where\n\nFurthermore, the SEC recently approved three 19b-4 exchange rule change requests from three US stock markets \u2014 NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOE \u2014 to list spot ether ETFs. With those landmark approvals out of the way, the SEC will soon review and is widely expected to approve associated S-1 filings from up to nine ETF sponsors.\n\nWorse for Saylor, those sponsors include the largest and most mainstream Wall Street institutions imaginable: BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Ark, and others.\n\nThat sets a final score for Saylor\u2019s three bets on Ethereum at 0-3: no SEC unregistered securities designation (yet, at least), likely SEC spot ether ETF approval, and mainstream institutional investor support.\n\nSaylor lost many bets, then won one\n\nOf course, Saylor has lost other bets during his career. For example, he lost $15 million in his bet that Washington DC wouldn\u2019t notice his $25 million tax evasion scheme. A few days ago, he agreed to pay $40 million to resolve his tax fraud lawsuit.\n\nSaylor also lost $8.5 million in his bet that he would avoid an SEC penalty for declaring false financials during the dot-com mania. He paid $8.2 million in stock plus $350,000 to settle.\n\nSaylor also lost an uncomfortable number of bets about the best corporate strategy for MicroStrategy for two full decades. From late 2000 through 2020, MicroStrategy stock failed to rally anywhere close to an all-time high despite Saylor\u2019s continuous leadership. Finally, in recent months, and thanks to an improved price of bitcoin, shares are approximately two-thirds of their way back to their dot-com highs.\n\nIn all, Saylor got a lot of bets wrong in his career, but only one mattered. His prediction that bitcoin was worth buying on margin has made up for all of his previous and subsequent errors. His company, MicroStrategy, owns 214,400 bitcoins today worth over $15 billion after buying at an average price of $35,180 per coin. With the crypto trading at double that price today, MicroStrategy has doubled its $7.5 billion investment.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "content": "Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser has recently reiterated his stance on Ethereum, predicting a dire future for the cryptocurrency against Bitcoin. Keiser\u2019s latest critique, shared on social media platform X, revives his longstanding view that Bitcoin outshines Ethereum and other altcoins on fundamental levels.\n\nAccording to Keiser, Ethereum is \u201cheading to zero against BTC,\u201d citing fundamental differences in their underlying technologies and legal classifications.\n\nCommodity Status And Decentralization Concerns\n\nKeiser\u2019s argument hinges on the idea that Ethereum is not centralized and lacks the commodity status and a decentralized proof-of-work algorithm that \u201cbolsters\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s appeal.\n\nHe points out that in countries like El Salvador, where he advises President Nayib Bukele on Bitcoin initiatives, Ethereum is regarded as an unregistered security rather than a commodity\u2014a status that Bitcoin has maintained in regulatory circles in the United States.\n\nETH is not decentralized It\u2019s not a commodity (like BTC)\n\nIt\u2019s not proof-of-work\n\nIt\u2019s heading to zero against BTC It\u2019s classified as an unregistered security in El Salvador https://t.co/KQ3oezLHo5 \u2014 Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 5, 2024\n\nDespite the criticisms from Bitcoin proponents, ETH continues to hold a substantial market position, trading above $3,800 with slight gains of 0.8% in the past 24 hours and 2% over the past week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin maximalists like Kaiser remain critical of the altcoin, many experts maintain a positive outlook, anticipating that ETH could mirror Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance of a parabolic rise.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s recent performance comes amid positive forecasts from major financial analysts, including those from investment firm VanEck, which recently adjusted their prediction for Ethereum\u2019s long-term price potential.\n\nContrasting View: VanEck Predicts A Bright Future For Ethereum\n\nIn a recent post updating its forecast for ETH, Investment firm VanEck has offered a more optimistic view, projecting ETH\u2019s price could reach $22,000 by 2030. This bullish outlook is based on ETH\u2019s role in the smart contract platform space, its ongoing development, and its ability to disrupt traditional markets.\n\nThe report from VanEck credits Ethereum\u2019s \u201crobust\u201d framework for developers and its potential impact on finance and Big Tech as pivotal factors for its future valuation.\n\nThe analysts at VanEck also point to the imminent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a key driver for ETH\u2019s adoption and price increase. They argue that such developments will enhance ETH\u2019s accessibility and demand, potentially leading to a significant market capitalization boost.\n\nThe VanEck analysts particularly noted:\n\nDriven by a strong value proposition to entrepreneurs, the Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech. Should it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66B in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22k per coin, by 2030.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

This represents a 487% increase from current levels, and VanEck bases its forecast on Ethereum\u2019s anticipated generation of $66 billion in \u201cfree cashflows.\u201d\n\nThe report puts a heavy weight into Ethereum\u2019s stablecoin landscape, as the blockchain settled $4 trillion in stablecoins over the past year, along with the facilitation of $5.5 trillion in these tokens. Additionally, the stablecoin market cap in Ethereum is at over $91 billion.\n\n\u201cCompared to Web2 applications, Ethereum ($3.4B) generates more revenue than Etsy ($2.7B), Twitch ($2.6B) and Roblox ($2.7B) [\u2026] Ethereum is a vibrant economic platform that can be considered a \u201cDigital Mall\u201d whose usership has grown ~1500%, and revenue has surged at a 161% CAGR since 2019,\u201d adds the document.\n\nNotably, the recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US also motivated the asset manager to evaluate their price prediction.\n\nVanEck also recognizes Ethereum\u2019s potential in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, mentioning the inclusion of the AI end-market in the updated valuation model.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum spot ETFs will perform much like their Bitcoin-based predecessors, hauling $4 billion of inflows within five months after launch, according to K33 Research.\n\n\u201cThis estimate is based on the relative global ETH assets under management (AUM) market share compared to BTC of 28%,\u201d wrote the crypto brokerage firm in a Tuesday report. Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)\u2019s ETH open interest is currently 23% of Bitcoin, reflecting a similar market share in another institutionally focused market.\n\nAs of June 3, US Bitcoin ETFs had absorbed $13.9 billion since their January launch. Across the world, Bitcoin ETFs now control over 1 million BTC, comprising over 5% of the circulating BTC supply.\n\nBy contrast, institutional funds currently control 3.3% of the circulating ETH supply. Using this as a benchmark, K33 said it expects anywhere from $3.1 billion to $4.8 billion worth of ETH ETF flows after launch. This comprises between 750,000 and 1 million ETH, or 0.65 to 0.85% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a big promise when compared to the Ethereum futures ETF debut last year, which hauled peanuts in AUM next to the launch of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021. K33 believes this lackluster launch was an outlier given the poor timing with which Ethereum ETFs hit the market, and is not representative of ETH\u2019s true investment demand.\n\nFor example, the firm notes, ETH CME futures\u2014currently sitting at 22.9% of Bitcoin\u2019s size\u2014have averaged a 35% share of the market since inception. Furthermore, Between September 29 and December 26, ETH futures ETFs experienced 34.6% of the inflows of their Bitcoin-based equivalents.\n\n\u201cIn Canada and Europe, ETH ETPs hold roughly 1/3 of the AUM held by BTC ETPs,\u201d wrote K33. \u201cU.S. futures-based ETH ETFs are pulling the global ETH dominance lower.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has previously predicted that the Ethereum ETFs will haul between 10% and 20% of what the Bitcoin spot ETFs did. \u201cGrabbing 20% of what they got would be a huge win/successful launch by normal ETF standards,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n10 may be a bit much.. but I'd at least divide by 5 when it comes to expectations around the Ether spot ETFs re flows/volume/media/everything relative to spot bitcoin ETFs. That said, grabbing 20% of what they got would be huge win/successful launch by normal ETF standards. https://t.co/QDenr3jY2B \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 29, 2024\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Analysts at K33 Research estimate that over the first five months of trading, net inflows into new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds in the United States could range from $3.1 billion to $4.8 billion.\n\nAccording to a report released on Tuesday by K33 Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde and DeFi analyst David Zimmerman, the experts\u2019 projections are predicated on market capitalization comparisons between Bitcoin and ether.\n\nThis prediction is based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) May 23 acceptance of 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs from companies including Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nThe report compares the market sizes of Ethereum and Bitcoin, pointing out that since the apex of the cryptocurrency bull market in November 2021, 3.3% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply has been held in investment vehicles.\n\nThe experts also draw comparisons between this trend with the drop of Bitcoin held in investment vehicles before the excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nExcept for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs) possess 28.2% of the assets under management held by their Bitcoin counterparts globally. In Canada and Europe, this percentage is almost 33%.\n\nNevertheless, just 5% of Bitcoin ETFs are Ethereum futures ETFs in the United States. Despite this, the analysts contend that there is a sizable institutional demand for ETH in the US, as evidenced by the CME\u2019s ETH open interest, which is presently 22.9% of the size of BTC.\n\nSource: K33 Research\n\nK33 Research predicts that the spot Ethereum ETFs may accumulate between 800,000 and 1.26 million ETH in their first five months, or between 0.7% and 1.05% of the circulating ether supply, based on the success of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSource: K33 Research\n\nAccording to analysts, the planned Ethereum ETFs from Fidelity and BlackRock may raise the price of ETH this summer. They anticipate high investor interest despite the lack of staking rewards that are common in ETH ETFs offered in Europe and Canada. Before trading may begin, issuers must receive approval for their S-1 registration. Investors should stay tuned for updates.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that before trading may begin, issuers must receive approval for their S-1 registration. Investors should stay tuned for updates. Consequently, market players and investors are excitedly anticipating more advancements in this area."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETFs will legitimize crypto, lead to ETH supply crunch \u2013 Integral - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The launch of spot Ethereum ETF will potentially result in a supply crunch upon launch, crypto accounting software firm Integral on June 3.\n\nThe projection mirrors the sentiment around spot Bitcoin ETFs before their launch earlier this year. The ETFs connected to the flagship crypto have since experienced record inflows, with the BTC supply on centralized exchanges falling notably in tandem.\n\nEthereum supply crunch\n\nIntegral anticipates that ETF issuers will buy and hold large amounts of ETH, thereby removing a portion of ETH from the open markets and driving up the crypto\u2019s price.\n\nThe trend is arguably already underway. Integral cited crypto entrepreneur Oliver Isaacs, who revealed that more than $3 billion of ETH had left exchanges since the SEC approved spot ETH approvals on May 23 \u2014 putting ETH exchange reserves at a six-year low.\n\nIntegral said that separate staking trends will intensify the supply crunch and noted that about 25% of the ETH supply is currently staked. ETF issuers will not engage in staking directly, but staking participants stand to benefit from rising prices, according to the company.\n\nAdditionally, Integral believes that approvals will increase institutional adoption of ETH and validate crypto as a legitimate asset class. Furthermore, it said that approvals could spark an \u201caltcoin season\u201d as demand for ETH spills over into other cryptos.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs are expected to launch in the coming weeks or months.\n\nIBIT accounts for 25% BlackRock flows\n\nMany are waiting to see whether Ethereum will follow the trend set by Bitcoin after ETFs connected to the flagship crypto began trading in January.\n\nThe Newborn Nine spot Bitcoin ETFs have cemented Bitcoin as a viable investment option in the traditional financial industry, as evidenced by their staggering and continued growth. BlackRock and Fidelity\u2018s IBIT and FBTC stand out in particular, following a record-setting streak of inflows in the history of ETFs.\n\nThe two funds now account for a significant portion of the overall ETF flows for both asset managers.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said BlackRock\u2019s IBIT accounted for 26% of the company\u2019s $65 billion ETF inflows since the start of the year. Notably, BlackRock is the largest ETF issuer in the US, with 429 exchange-traded funds under its belt.\n\nIBIT has recorded total inflows of $16.7 billion since its launch.\n\nMeanwhile, Fidelity\u2019s competing FBTC fund accounts for 56% of its $15.8 billion total ETF flows this year. FBTC has seen $8.9 billion in total inflows to date.\n\nFidelity has launched and manages 70 ETFs.\n\nBalchunas\u2019 data indicates BlackRock and Fidelity are the second and fifth leading ETF issuers based on year-to-date flows. The two companies rank first and second when solely considering firms that have launched a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGlobal asset manager VanEck predicted Wednesday that the price of Ethereum will reach $22,000 by the end of the decade, dubbing the cryptocurrency \u201cdigital oil\u201d in a new report. That would represent a 468% increase from Ethereum\u2019s current price.\n\nWhile Ethereum has generated $3.4 billion in revenue over the past year, VanEck additionally sees that figure reaching $51 billion by 2030.\n\n\u201cWe believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world,\u201d the report asserted. \u201cThe Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech.\u201d\n\nVanEck characterized Ethereum as the centerpiece of its own financial system, as its network already secures over $90 billion in stablecoins, around $7 billion in tokenized assets, and $308 billion in digital assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, VanEck sees Ethereum making inroads outside of crypto. Based on the size of business sectors that Ethereum-built applications could disrupt, VanEck estimated that the network's total addressable market stands at $15 trillion. Those opportunities lie largely in finance, banking, and payments, VanEck said.\n\nEthereum could also find roles in infrastructure and artificial intelligence, the firm added, as well as marketing, advertising, social, and gaming.\n\nWe've raised our 2030 ETH price target to $22K, influenced by ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of onchain data. Additionally, we've analyzed how ETH and BTC perform in both traditional and crypto-only portfolios for optimal returns. @Matthew_Sigel @Patrick_Bush_VE\u2026 \u2014 VanEck (@vaneck_us) June 5, 2024\n\nThe report highlighted some of Ethereum\u2019s distinct aspects as a network and an asset, from its nature as \u201cprogrammable money\u201d to a \u201cyield bearing commodity.\u201d Notably, VanEck\u2019s report calls Ethereum an \u201cinternet reserve currency,\u201d central to its massive ecosystem and layer-2 networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVanEck\u2019s report comes not long after the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Allowing mainstream investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a traditional brokerage account, the move also had implications for Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status.\n\nFor crypto natives, the concept may be basic, but its significance was underscored by VanEck: In order to send Ethereum or engage with smart contracts, a user needs to spend Ethereum on gas fees, which are then removed from circulation through burning. In essence, VanEck said that this dynamic benefits Ethereum holders two-fold: providing demand while reducing supply.\n\nThe asset manager expects Ethereum will also chip away at established tech giants like Google and Apple as a platform for developers to create consumer-facing applications. While the firms take around 30% of revenue from apps hosted in their respective digital stores, VanEck said Ethereum currently takes around 24% of reventhrough gas fees.\n\n\u201cCompared to data-centric social networking platforms like Facebook, we believe Ethereum may enable more capable and lucrative applications for entrepreneurs,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAs more data is generated in public and more commerce is moved off expensive, closed financial rails, business moats will erode.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBase, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network launched by top U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, generated more than $6 million in on-chain profits in May, making it the most profitable layer-2 network while topping the likes of Blast and Optimism in the process.\n\nBase\u2019s surging profits have been fueled by a rapid increase in total value locked (TVL), according to L2BEAT, in turn driven by Ethereum\u2019s implementation of EIP-4844 and proto-danksharding via the anticipated Dencun upgrade in March.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics platform GrowThePie, Base generated the most on-chain profit of any layer-2 chain with $6.1 million in May, followed by $1.5 million for Blast and $1.4 million for Optimism. While Base is far ahead of these rivals in the profitability wars, its monthly tally has declined sharply after spiking with Dencun upgrade in March.\n\nOn the other hand, Blast, the rising layer-2 network from the makers of NFT marketplace Blur, has recently gained recognition for its unique native yield for ETH and stablecoins, as well as projects like Pacmoon and Fantasy Top that are doling out ample incentives to users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlast\u2019s share of all layer-2 profits increased from 5.3% in April to 15.2% in May. It\u2019s still well behind Base, however, which enjoyed 56.8% of all layer-2 profits last month.\n\nOn-chain profitability for layer-2 networks refers to the balance between costs to interact with the layer-1 network (Ethereum) and revenues generated via fees, token issuance, and other means. It does not include any off-chain expenses, and thus should not be considered a complete picture of how these networks are run from top to bottom.\n\nA Dune dashboard maintained by pseudonymous on-chain analyst Kofi also put Base on top, but with just shy of $7 million in profit in May. The variance may be due to differences in how each data curator measures revenue and expenses. Dune\u2019s dashboard excludes Blast data, however, so it\u2019s an incomplete picture of how leading layer-2s stack up in that regard.\n\nHere's how much onchain profit L2s earned in May Onchain profit = Revenue from L2 gas fees - Costs of posting batches and verifying proofs on L1 1. Base - $6.98M\n\n2. Optimism - $1.57M\n\n3. Scroll - $1.35M\n\n4. Arbitrum - $802k\n\n5. Linea - $612k pic.twitter.com/BuvV0yCm3a \u2014 Kofi (@0xKofi) June 3, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPer GrowThePie, Base has been the most profitable L2 each month since March 2024. In the last three months, its TVL nearly sextupled, from $1.3 billion to $7.6 billion, a historical high for the chain. As Optimism\u2019s TVL has remained roughly flat in the last month, Base may be poised to overtake OP Mainnet.\n\nBoth Base and OP Mainnet are built on the OP Stack and are part of the Optimism \u201csuperchain\u201d ecosystem, though they\u2019re considered to be distinct L2s within that ecosystem. In terms of TVL, Base still remains far behind industry leader Arbitrum, which has $19.1 billion in TVL.\n\nBesides the upgrades made possible by the Dencun fork, Base\u2019s appeal within the crypto community has grown since Coinbase announced its new Smart Wallet, which is expected to improve accessibility of on-chain transactions to new adopters.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Smart Wallet will make use of account abstraction, a way to facilitate easy on-chain transactions for those unfamiliar with the details of DeFi. Base has also benefited from the profile of Coinbase and the added exposure therein, along with promotional pushes like the latest \u201cOn-Chain Summer\u201d rewards campaign that kicked off this week.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a significant development on the cryptocurrency market, a massive Ethereum (ETH) transfer has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, tweeted that 8,759 ETH, worth around $32.96 million, have been transferred from an unknown wallet to Coinbase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis transfer signals a potential sell-off from an Ethereum whale. Whale movements often serve as significant indicators of market sentiment. Large transfers, especially those heading toward exchanges like Coinbase, typically suggest that the whale might be preparing to sell a portion of their holdings. Such actions can lead to increased volatility and potential price adjustments as the market reacts to the influx of supply.\n\nCurrent market sentiment\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and whale movements often exacerbate this characteristic. While the exact intentions behind the recent transfer remain speculative, the market's response has been cautious. As of the latest data, the price of Ethereum stands at $3,761, marking a 1.40% decline in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe recent whale movement has added a layer of intrigue to the market, as investors speculate on the potential impact of such large transfers on ETH\u2019s price trajectory. ETH's price dip in the last 24 hours could be partially attributed to the transfer news, as traders and investors react to the potential implications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the recent dip, Ethereum\u2019s overall performance has been strong. The 20.86% increase over the last 30 days highlights the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward momentum, driven by several factors, including the broader market recovery, the spot Ethereum ETF approvals, and the ongoing development within the Ethereum network.\n\nOverall, the recent transfer of ETH to Coinbase has certainly stirred the waters within the market. While the exact intentions of the whale remain unclear, such large movements are always noteworthy and can significantly impact market dynamics. As Ethereum continues to navigate through its price consolidation phase, all eyes will be on broader market reactions and subsequent whale activities."

        "title": "3 Top Cryptos Worth Holding Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum - The Tokenist",
        "content": "Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.\n\nAmong thousands of cryptocurrencies, it is clear that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the public spotlight and are likely to take more capital inflows in the future. So much so that even Ethereum is poised to become an institutional investment vehicle via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), joining Bitcoin.\n\nOut of a total $2.63 trillion market cap, including stablecoins, ETH and BTC make 70% of the crypto pie. Year-to-date, Bitcoin and Ethereum are neck and neck, having gained 60% and 62% value, respectively.\n\nHowever, the larger the market cap, the harder it is to move the price upwards, just like in the stock market. This is why many low-cap memecoins performed well during 2024, driven by speculation and memory.\n\nYet, engaging in memecoins is exceedingly risky. Most traders can\u2019t tell if they are riding from the top to the bottom, holding the devalued bags, or riding from the bottom to the top, enjoying substantial profits. After all, memecoins\u2019 value is inherently unclear, which makes them so speculative in the first place.\n\nTo that end, prospective crypto investors should look into these infrastructure cryptocurrencies, which are backed by developers, funding, and clear goals.\n\nImmutable X (IMX)\n\nImmutable X (IMX) is an investor\u2019s exposure to blockchain gaming. While Ethereum is a blockchain network for issuing tokens and smart contracts to power decentralized finance (DeFi) with dApps, it relies on layer 2 networks to scale. Immutable X is one of those networks.\n\nOwing to StarkWare\u2019s zk-rollups technology, Immutable X facilitates zero gas fees for end-users. This contrasts Ethereum\u2019s expensive and volatile gas fees for even simple token transfers. In turn, this is a game changer for game developers who wish to deploy their products at scale.\n\nFor instance, if a game has tradable in-game assets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), like cards or collectible creatures, traders don\u2019t have to worry about long confirmation times and heavy transaction fees. This boosts the in-game economy and player experience, paving the way for blockchain gaming.\n\nPresently, there are over 300 games in Immutable\u2019s funding ecosystem worth $1 billion over 20 marketplaces. Previously known as Fuel Games, Immutable is the parent company in charge of the Immutable X framework for developers to launch their projects with low friction.\n\nThe cryptocurrency itself, IMX, is the utility and governance token of the network. Akin to shareholders of companies, IMX tokenholders get a say in the development of the platform with a voting mechanism. Additionally, developers using the platform pay 2% fee in IMX tokens.\n\nFor comparison, game developers deploying their games on Steam suffer a 30% sales cut. The total IMX token supply is limited, just like Bitcoin, but to a greater extent, it has 2 billion IMX tokens, of which 74% are already in a circulating supply.\n\nYear-to-date, the IMX token has gained 12% value after price correction but 393% over the last year. Given that the Immutable X network is Ethereum-adjacent, the token is likely to revisit previous highs with the prospective launch of ETH ETFs. According to Fortune Business Insights, the blockchain gaming market is forecasted for a 21.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2030.\n\nJoin our Telegram group and never miss a breaking story.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nEthereum\u2019s software engineering path relies on layer 2 networks to offload the transaction burden from the main network. Avalanche (AVAX) is a competitive, versatile network that picked another approach.\n\nInstead of users having to jump through network hoops with their Web3 wallets, Avalanche itself has a modular design via subnets. Each subnet has its own rules and consensus mechanisms, but they all operate under the high-throughput Avalanche consensus protocol.\n\nIn addition, Avalanche boosts scaling with three interoperable blockchains within the network. X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain tackle different aspects of the network, like staking, smart contracts, and asset creation.\n\nThis leads to a greater unified experience for the end-user, who still enjoys fast execution and low fees. Moreover, Avalanche\u2019s C-Chain ensures compatibility with Ethereum, enabling users to transfer digital assets with Avalanche Bridge via the Core wallet.\n\nAttesting to Avalanche\u2019s approach to blockchain design, several banks used it to test their future tokenization efforts, including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan.\n\nPowering the network\u2019s economy, the AVAX token is limited to 720 million, of which 55% is in circulation. AVAX token holders get a say in the issuance of the remaining supply. Year-to-date, AVAX is down 14%, making for a solid entry point after a one-year value growth of 160%.\n\nFetch.AI (FET)\n\nJust as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reaped the AI hype, Fetch.AI did the same in the blockchain world. The FET token gained 794% value over one year, or 194% YTD. Moving forward, this is crypto investor\u2019s main exposure to the tokenization of AI projects.\n\nThat\u2019s because Fetch.AI (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) will all be under the umbrella of the SuperIntelligence Alliance, with its new universal token ASI, poised to merge the market caps of FET, AGIX, and OCEAN tokens.\n\nAfter the merger into ASI, FET tokens will be limited to a 2.63 billion supply. Mirroring the decentralization efforts of finance to counter banks and central banking, the new network\u2019s purpose is to monetize AI development openly and transparently.\n\nThis includes raising funds for AI projects with ASI tokens, paying transaction fees, using it as a governance token for voting, and using it as a utility for open-source AI development. After the merger announcement in mid-April, the FET price has been moving sideways, having dropped by 3%.\n\nWhich types of tokens do you prefer as your main exposure: sound money, generalist DeFI, gaming, or something else? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nDisclaimer: The author does not hold or have a position in any securities discussed in the article."

With the recent approval of Spot ETH ETFs by the SEC, full approval by the regulator is due soon, and thus, the hype around the asset is rising. Due to these updates, many price predictions are now bullish around Ethereum, and VanEck is updating there\u2019s as well, setting a new target for the asset by 2030.\n\n\u201cDriven by a strong value proposition to entrepreneurs, the Ethereum network is likely to continue its rapid market share growth from traditional financial market participants and, increasingly, Big Tech,\u201d VanEck says. \u201cShould it do so while maintaining its dominant position among smart contract platforms, we see a credible path to $66B in free cash flow to token holders supporting a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22k per coin, by 2030.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: NVIDIA Surpasses $3 Trillion Market Cap, Briefly Tops Apple\n\nHow High Can Ethereum Go Following ETF Approval?\n\nSource: iGaming.org\n\nExperts are predicting the Spot Ethereum ETFs to go live this month, a much faster timetable than that of the Bitcoin ETFs previously approved in January. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,867.65, up 3% in the past week and 23% in the past 30 days. Ethereum\u2019s all-time high is $4,891.70, which it reached on Nov. 16, 2021. Many experts predict that following the approval of the ETFs, Ether will follow Bitcoin\u2019s path and surge to new all-time highs upon the debut of its ETFs.\n\nETH reaching $5,000 will be the first step to $22,000 by 2030 if VanEck\u2019s prediction rings true. However, with the growing popularity of Ethereum and other cryptocurrency assets, a six-year timetable to 6x in price is not too far out in left field."

For now, Ethereum is moving at the $3,760 price level, with support at $3,720. In case of a drop below the aforementioned support, the 26 EMA is the next level for a bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPotential volatility is indicated by Ethereum's current price action. Since the $3,720 support level has already been put to the test multiple times, bulls must protect it. The 26 EMA, which is currently at $3,568, is the next major support if this level is broken.\n\nIt will be carefully observed if this moving average can offer support, as it has in the past during corrections. The signals from the technical indicators are conflicting. The fact that the RSI is circling 62 indicates that ETH is not yet in overbought territory, but more downside is possible before oversold levels are reached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe low volume, on the other hand, suggests that there is not much buying interest to drive prices higher. Additionally, it is generally regarded as a bearish signal that Ethereum has been moving in a consolidation for more than a week. This implies that there may be a slowing of the recent upward momentum.\n\nIn comparison to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has performed rather well, considering the larger market environment. External variables though, like news about an ETF or notable changes in the price of Bitcoin, might have an effect. However, the market is relatively bullish, which could be beneficial to ETH."

Despite Ethereum\u2019s price action, JASMY, RLC and PEPE show strong rallies.

MicroStrategy has been betting their entire business on BTC. And has been successful so far. Its share price already exceeds the level from 2021. How much more could MSTR rally? Elliott Wave structure and Fibonacci gives us a possible target above ATHs from year 2000.

        "content": "In a recent appearance on CNBC, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler provided insights into the expected timeline for the review of the spot Ethereum ETF S-1 reports. Eleanor Terrett, a reporter at Fox Business, relayed this as an indication that the review process is expected to be lengthy, potentially causing delays in the approval process for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a reminder, last Friday marked a significant deadline as spot Ethereum ETF issuers, including industry giants BlackRock and VanEck, submitted their initial draft S-1 forms to the SEC. The regulator will now begin the review process, providing feedback and requesting amendments. Industry insiders expect at least two rounds of draft filings before a final decision is made.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: @SECGov Chairman @GaryGensler says the next step in the $ETH ETF approvals \u201cwill take some time,\u201d possibly indicating a potential slow-walk of the S-1 approval process. https://t.co/iwfN9vvmt8 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 5, 2024\n\nIn contrast to the relatively straightforward path of Bitcoin ETF approvals, the altcoin landscape appears to be murkier, according to market participants. While unanimous approval would mark a pivotal moment for the market, recent events have created uncertainty. For example, Hashdex's withdrawal of its application for undisclosed reasons has left market participants questioning the overall trajectory of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttention now shifts to the SEC's stance on the crypto market and the ongoing developments in Bitcoin ETFs, as liquidity in traditional financial markets is hundreds of times greater than cryptocurrency. On one side, that does not mean that investors would want to increase their risk by switching to altcoins, and vice versa - they may shift some funds from Bitcoin ETFs in a search of extra profits."

        "content": "Analyst expects further ETH bullish momentum as options volumes remain high\n\nHowever, divergent views on non-staking ETH ETF demand persisted.\n\nAfter reversing all the losses made between March and May, Ethereum [ETH] has been quiet on the charts, swinging around $3,800 for about two weeks now.\n\nWas it the calm before a spot ETH ETF-induced storm on the price charts? Maybe.\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish expectations\n\nAccording to Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital, ETH\u2019s options market volume was higher than BTC\u2019s, underscoring further bullish expectations for the king of altcoins.\n\n\u201cThis bullishness is likely to continue as the market waits for the ETH spot ETF to usher in new demand. The options market certainly reflects this, with ETH vols still trading 15% over BTC vols.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, an X user (formerly Twitter), MacroCRG, established that ETH trended higher amidst a weakening US Dollar Index (DXY). Both Bitcoin and ETH are inversely correlated. A weakening DXY always coincides with a rally for ETH and BTC.\n\nETH ETF demand factor\n\nMost market observers eyed massive demand for ETH from spot ETH ETFs. However, there have been divergent views on this, especially after spot ETH ETFs removed the staking option.\n\nOne of the users mentioned that going for a non-staking spot-ETH ETF had \u2018an opportunity cost.\u2019\n\n\u201cA non-staking ETH ETF has a distinct opportunity cost in native supply adjusted terms that the BTC ETF does not.\u2019\n\nHowever, on his part, David Hoffman of Bankless rebutted the claim and stated,\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019re overindexing on how much TradFi cares about this, versus DGAFing and wanting exposure. IMO, the addition of staking will simply be a second-wind for flows.\u2019\n\nIn fact, one of the potential issuers, ARK Invest, dropped from the ETH ETF party, citing that,\n\n\u201cWe will continue evaluating efficient ways to provide our investors with exposure to this innovative technology in a way that unlocks its full benefit.\u201d\n\nHowever, Galaxy Digital\u2019s Mike Novogratz recently projected that staking could be allowed within two years after the ETH ETF launch. If the projection plays out, we could see the \u2018second wind for flows\u2019 by then.\n\nThat said, a weakening DXY could boost ETH\u2019s short-term price action before spot ETH ETFs launch. However, how demand plays out post-ETH ETFs remains to be seen."

Meanwhile, Ethereum derivatives products on exchanges have seen a surge in open interest (OI).\n\nDaily digest market movers: ETH ETFs delay, rising open interest, new accumulating addresses growth\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said spot ETH ETFs would \"take some time\" before they go live on exchanges, indicating S-1 approvals are not imminent. He noted that his agency is still working on disclosure measures with exchanges.\n\nRead more: Ethereum leveraged ETFs go live as price fails to react\n\nAfter the SEC's sudden approval of 19b-4 filings from eight issuers on May 23, several analysts expected the agency to respond to S-1 registration statements quickly. The SEC's request for issuers to submit updated S-1 filings on Friday also seemed to have confirmed the expectations of these analysts.\n\nFollowing the filings, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggested spot ETH ETFs would launch in July. However, with Gensler's recent comments, it may take longer before the ETFs begin trading.\n\nIn other news, open interest (OI) for ETH derivatives products on exchanges reached a new all-time high, rising by 50.3% to $14 billion, according to CCData Exchange Review for May. Notably, open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged by 59.4% to $1.25 billion.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum sustains week-long consolidation, sees over $3 billion exodus from exchanges\n\nMeanwhile, the balance of new accumulating addresses holding between 10 - 10K and 10K to 100K ETH has been growing steadily since the SEC's pivot on ETH ETF, according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\nETH New Accumulation\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum to maintain sideways trend until spot ETH ETFs launch\n\nEthereum saw a slight gain on Wednesday, trading near $3,860 and continuing its sideways trend.\n\nETH's 30-day MVRV also aligns with the horizontal move, hovering around 6% in the past week. This indicates that the number of Ethereum addresses that purchased the coin within the last 30 days has seen an average of 6% gains.\n\nRead more: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Bitcoin\u2019s momentum poise to propel crypto market\n\nDespite the horizontal trend, whales are still accumulating ETH, and both long-term and short-term holders will likely hold onto their tokens.\n\nETH may continue its horizontal trend until the official launch of spot ETH ETFs. The $3,618 price level remains key support in case of short-term price swings. In the long term, ETH may overtake the $4,093 resistance and flip the $4,878 level to set a new all-time high of around $5,000.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nQCP Capital analysts also share the bullish view: \"ETH has been lagging on this move, but we expect a catch-up and possibly even outperformance against BTC when the ETH spot ETF begins trading,\" they said.\n\nETH liquidation data shows a total of $23.78 million liquidations, with $13.81 million of liquidated long positions and $9.97 million of shorts, according to data from Coinglass."

        "content": "800,000 ETH (worth $3 billion) were withdrawn from exchanges post-ETF approval.\n\nLarge investors and institutions may be positioning for a bullish future.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] market performance has shown remarkable resilience in the face of recent fluctuations, maintaining a stable price level below the $4,000 mark despite slight volatility.\n\nOver the past week, Ethereum\u2019s value oscillated between $3,800 and $3,700, closing recently at approximately $3,768.\n\nThis relatively steady state, characterized by a modest 2.1% decline over the week and a 1.1% dip in the last 24 hours, might seem uneventful at first glance.\n\nHowever, this could be indicative of a more profound dynamic at play within the crypto market.\n\nThe recent calm in Ethereum\u2019s price coincides with significant developments in the regulatory landscape and market structure, particularly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of the Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nThis regulatory milestone has set off a notable reaction in the crypto exchanges, leading to a substantial shift in Ethereum holdings.\n\nWhale movements and market impact\n\nPost-ETF approval, Ethereum saw a dramatic increase in activity, with around 800,000 ETH, valued at nearly $3 billion, being withdrawn from exchanges within just eight days.\n\nThis mass exodus of Ethereum from exchanges mirrors a similar pattern observed previously with Bitcoin following its ETF approvals, suggesting a strategic positioning by investors in anticipation of heightened demand.\n\nThese withdrawals were highlighted by Cryptoquant\u2019s analysis, which pointed to a possible orchestrated move by institutional players preparing to cater to their clients\u2019 needs in the wake of the ETF launch.\n\nThe implications of such significant market movements are quite profound.\n\nCrypto analyst Burak Kesmeci, reporting on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, speculated that either large-scale investors (\u201cwhales\u201d) or institutions might be gearing up for a bullish future for Ethereum post-ETF.\n\nThe massive outflow, according to Kesmeci, is likely to positively impact Ethereum\u2019s price in the medium term, as these large holdings reduce available market supply, potentially leading to price increases as demand continues to rise.\n\nInvestor appetite for ETH grows, but what do fundamentals say?\n\nSupporting this analysis, data from IntoTheBlock revealed a growing concentration of Ethereum holdings among large investors.\n\nAs of 31st May, 2024, 41% of Ethereum wallets held more than 1% of total circulation, a significant increase from earlier in the year. This concentration suggests a growing confidence among significant stakeholders in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to consider the broader market dynamics. Despite the potential for a supply squeeze, the overall circulating supply of Ethereum has continued to rise, indicating that not all large holders are in accumulation mode.\n\nFurthermore, trading metrics such as open interest and trading volume on futures markets have shown substantial increases, suggesting a robust and active trading environment that could influence Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Ethereum\u2019s open interest has seen a significant uptick, rising by nearly 3% to a valuation of $17 billion. This surge has also boosted open interest volume, which has increased by approximately 15% to $21.40 billion.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nMeanwhile, an analysis of Santiment\u2019s data by AMBCrypto reveals that holders of 0.01-10 ETH have reduced their overall ETH holdings, while addresses with more than 10 ETH have also sold off a portion of their assets.\n\nThis profit-taking behavior, observed among both retail investors and whales, has not been intense enough to negatively impact prices."

        "title": "ETH Supply Can Drop By 1.26 Million In Five Months of Spot Ethereum ETF Launch - CoinGape",
        "content": "All eyes are currently on the SEC\u2019s decision regarding the approval of spot Ethereum ETF S-1 registrations, which could act as a catalyst for a broader market rally. According to a recent report from K33 Research, Ethereum might experience a supply shock, with nearly 1.26 million ETH potentially moving off exchanges within just five months of the ETF launch. This shift could significantly boost the Ether (ETH) price, potentially leading to a new all-time high.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs to See $4 Billion in Inflows\n\nAs per the K33 Research, the spot Ethereum ETFs could see a staggering $4 billion in inflows within just the first five months of launch. K33 Research based its forecast by comparing the assets under management (AUM) in existing Ethereum (ETH)-based exchange-traded products worldwide to similar Bitcoin (BTC) products. They also analyzed the open interest (OI) in futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a key marketplace for institutional investors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs of now, Ether\u2019s open interest (OI) on the CME exchange stands at 23% of the size of Bitcoin futures. However, ever since the ETH futures started trading on CME back in 2021, they have grabbed a 35% share of the BTC futures, indicating that there\u2019s been a strong institutional demand for ETH.\n\nWhile comparing these ratios along with the $14 billion in inflows for the spot Bitcoin ETFs, K33 Research predicts that the spot Ether ETFs could see inflows anywhere between $3 billion and $4.8 billion within the first five months of launch.\n\nAs per the current ETH price of $3,800, this could mean that 800,000 to 1.26 million of ETH accumulation will happen through the ETFs. This is nearly 0.7%-1.05% of the total circulating ETH supply.\n\nETH to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nSoon after the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, the BTC price rallied by 60% to record highs. As per K33 Research, if the Ethereum ETFs go live for trading, Ethereum will start outperforming BTC, after nearly two years of underperformance.\n\nMore importantly, in its research report, it noted that the removal of the staking feature from ETFs won\u2019t negatively impact the inflows into the investment product. K33 noted that in Canadian ETH ETFs, 99% of assets under management are housed in funds that do not involve staking, while in European products, the figure stands at 98%.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors are watching the performance of major coins like Ethereum (ETH) and their potential impact on the broader market. One coin that is in the spotlight is Shiba Inu (SHIB). With Ethereum\u2019s price on the rise, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: how high can Shiba Inu go when Ethereum hits $20,000?\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Current Market Performance\n\nIn recent days, SHIB has gained momentum, reaching a low of $0.00002369 and a high of $0.00002577 in the past 24 hours. Currently, SHIB is trading with an 8% surge in its overall performance during this period.\n\nAlso read: Can Solana (SOL) Breach $260 And Hit New ATH in June?\n\nHowever, the meme coin has been down by 10.3% in the last seven days. Despite this temporary setback, SHIB enthusiasts remain confident in the coin\u2019s prospects in the current bull market.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s Potential Value with Ethereum at $20,000\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is trading at $3,813, reflecting 30-day gains exceeding 20.3%. For ETH to reach the $20,000 threshold, it would need to increase by 427%.\n\nIf Shiba Inu were to mirror Ethereum\u2019s growth and achieve a 427% increase from its current price, its value could skyrocket to $0.0001282. This price level would be a new all-time high for Shiba Inu, breaching its previous ATH of $0.00008845.\n\nAlso read: Ripple: How Many XRP You Need To Make $5 Million If Price Hits $2?\n\nThe Correlation Between Ethereum and SHIB\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock stats, SHIB has a 69% correlation with the price of ETH, indicating that there is a 69% chance that SHIB will follow ETH if it rises to $20,000.\n\nThis strong correlation suggests that Shiba Inu\u2019s price is heavily influenced by the performance of Ethereum, and a significant surge in ETH\u2019s value could have a profound impact on SHIB\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Poised to Hit $0.0001 in June, Says Leading Analyst"

        "content": "Wed 05 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe issue of governance keeps resurfacing in the complex and evolving Ethereum ecosystem. A recent report from Galaxy Digital sheds new light on this topic. Its findings are quite surprising.\n\nThe main actors of Ethereum blockchain governance\n\nThe governance of Ethereum relies on several stakeholders, each playing a distinct role in the decision-making process. Client teams, at the forefront, are responsible for the development and maintenance of the main software essential for the proper functioning of the network. The report highlights their crucial role in proposing, discussing, and implementing changes, notably through Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Meanwhile, validation node operators exert significant influence by voting on which software versions to run, adding a tangible aspect to Ethereum\u2019s decentralized governance.\n\nDecentralized application (dApp) developers are also key players in this governance. They develop features and perform upgrades based on user needs. Furthermore, lively discussions on governance are held in various forums, including Ethereum All Core Developers calls, ETHMagicians, and Discord, illustrating the community\u2019s ongoing commitment to the decision-making process.\n\nOff-chain governance: a delicate choice\n\nThe report highlights Ethereum\u2019s preference for off-chain governance rather than direct on-chain voting by ETH holders. This decision is motivated by the fear of power centralizing in the hands of a small group of token holders, which could undermine the highly valued decentralization. However, this approach also poses challenges, particularly in terms of transparency and objective assessment of the decision-making process.\n\nAlthough the off-chain approach allows for nuanced and diversified decision-making, its lack of traceability can raise concerns about the legitimacy of the decisions made. Despite these challenges, the Ethereum community remains steadfastly committed to maintaining a transparent and inclusive decision-making process, which is the foundation of the decentralized governance characterizing the blockchain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance, as revealed by the Galaxy Digital report, illustrates the importance of the off-chain process in making crucial decisions. As the community continues its journey into the future, it is important to recognize the opportunities and challenges inherent in this decentralized approach to ensure the sustainability and robustness of this iconic blockchain.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "ETH/BTC Price Prediction: Will Ethereum Price Hit $10,000 On BlackRock ETH ETF? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has been in consolidation for the past few weeks as the market prepares for an S-1 application approval. Ethereum price is currently trading at $3,787, a 0.6% increase in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin broke above $70,000 once more after more than a month of trending below this crucial level and continues its journey to try and break an all-time high.\n\nETH/BTC Price Analysis: Ethereum Price Succumbs to Bitcoin Rally, Can ETH Bounce Back?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH price against Bitcoin witnessed some downward pressure as Bitcoin bulls pushed its price above $70,000 for the first time in the last 30 days. The majority of cryptocurrencies shed some value against BTC, and Ethereum was not left out.\n\nThe price of Ethereum broke downward from the consolidation zone and is headed toward the 50% Fibonacci retracement level around 0.052 BTC. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, this retracement level may act as a zone of support a bounce back higher toward the 27% Fibonacci extension level around 0.06 BTC.\n\nOn the way up, ETH price may encounter resistance around 0.057 BTC, and $0.058 BTC. Conversely, the support structure around 0.052 BTC may prevent the price of ETH from falling lower.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin price just broke out of a descending triangle in a classic textbook breakout and retest pattern. BTC price may move higher, with a profit target for this kind of setup anywhere around $74,000. This would establish a new all-time high price for the king of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin price may find some overhead resistance around $72,200 and $74,000, but on the flip side, a key support level around $67,000 may help keep the price up.\n\nETH/BTC Price Future Outlook\n\nAs the Ethereum community awaits S-1 application approval, the Bitcoin community continues to spearhead mass adoption for the number one crypto. El Salvador, the \u2018Bitcoin State\u2019 now owns 5,660 BTC worth over $402 million, and is still accumulating.\n\nMoreover, the University of Austin, a private Texas institution, will now accept Bitcoin for tuition and create a long-term Bitcoin fund.\n\nMeanwhile, liquid staking and restaking on Ethereum is only gearing up, and much more liquidity is about to hit the ecosystem, a phenomenon that could pump the price of Ethereum even higher. When including liquid staking, Ethereum mainnet TVL came within 2% of its ATH recently\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe crypto community is optimistic about an S-1 Form approval because BlackRock submitted it. The firm has a clean history of only wins when it comes to ETF applications and the Ethereum community is banking on this to pump ETH price to $10,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "content": "Over the past two weeks, the crypto market has been wavering in uncertainty showcasing no clear commitment to a particular direction. The leading digital assets Bitcoin and Ethereum price represent this indecisive nature with several short-bodied candles in the daily chart.\n\nHowever, in the recent analysis shared by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin Thermo Cap Ratio was highlighted as an insightful metric for understanding Bitcoin\u2019s valuation relative to its network fundamentals.\n\nadvertisement\n\n#Bitcoin is not currently overvalued based on network fundamentals. pic.twitter.com/fFLQF34VQv \u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) June 3, 2024\n\nThe Thermo Cap Ratio rarely highlighted in mainstream analysis, measures miners\u2019 cumulative security spend (or thermo cap) against the market cap. According to Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin is \u201cnot currently overvalued based on network fundamentals despite recent price increases.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the market appears to be regaining its bullish momentum through ongoing consolidation and could continue the existing rally shortly.\n\nAlso Read: Top Reasons ETH Price Could Reach a New All-Time High Soon\n\n1) Ethereum Price Treading Dangerously\n\nEthereum stands out as a decentralized platform that not only supports cryptocurrencies like Ether but also enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nEthereum price traded at $3762 on Tuesday, with the market cap holding at $452.1 billion. Amid the current market uncertainty, the leading altcoin has stabilized above $3700 support.\n\nThe daily chart projecting several lower-price rejection candles at this $3700 indicates the buyers are actively defending the support. A potential rebound from this support will push the ETH price by 8.5% to challenge the $4,090 peak and resistance. Note that a breakout from this barrier is crucial for buyers to resume the prevailing uptrend.\n\nHowever, if the current consolidation is prolonged it would indicate weakness in buyers\u2019 conviction, suggesting a potential breakdown from $3500 support.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Analysis: Can Bulls Push Price to $5,000 on the RWA Narrative?\n\n2) Cardano (ADA)\n\nCardano (ADA) is a third-generation blockchain platform known for its research-driven approach and commitment to security and sustainability. It distinguishes itself through a layered architecture that separates the settlement and computational layers, enabling more flexible updates and maintenance.\n\nThe Cardano price has been trading sideways for nearly two months, resonating within two converging trendlines of the symmetrical triangle pattern. The altcoin rebounded twice from the upper boundary and thrice from the lower indicating the trades are following the lead of this pattern formation.\n\nCurrently, the ADA price trades at $0.455, seeking support at the lower trendline. The Cardano coin currently holds a market cap of $16.27 Billion and maintains its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency.\n\nUnder favorable market conditions, the coin buyers are likely to breach the overhead trendline signaling the end of the consolidation trendline. The post-breakout rally could lead the ADA price to $0.62, followed by $0.68.\n\nAlso Read: Cardano (ADA) Breaks May Bearish Streak, But Major Twist Lies Ahead\n\n3) PEPE Coin (PEPE)\n\nPEPE Coin is a meme-themed cryptocurrency inspired by the popular internet meme, Pepe the Frog. This project stands out for its community-driven approach and its focus on the playful, irreverent culture that characterizes many meme-based digital assets.\n\nAn ascending trendline in the daily chart carries the current recovery trendline in PEPE price. The coin buyers witnessing suitable pullback support have managed to uplift the asset from the April low of $0.00000393 to the $0.00001725 high registering a 339% gain.\n\nHowever, the PEPE price reverted 17% to $0.00001434 with the market correction, while the market cap plunged to $6.035 Billion.\n\nThe coin price heading close to the aforementioned trendline could again bolster buyers with demand pressure. A potential rebound from the support will challenge $0.00001725 and aim for a higher target at $0.00002, followed by $0.000024.\n\nAlso Read: Pepe Coin Price Prediction As Bullish Sentiment Bursts, Rally To $0.00002 Incoming?\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe current market consolidation evidenced by Bitcoin price prediction and the Ethereum price sideways action has stalled the recovery momentum for most major altcoins. However, with on-chain indicators like the Thermo Cap Ratio, the broader trend remains bullish and currently stabilizes for future moves. Thus, the ongoing consolidation could bolster buyers to replenish recovery momentum and provide new entry opportunities for investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Tue 04 Jun 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nBetween revolutionary announcements, technological advancements, and regulatory turmoil, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a land of unlimited innovations and a field of regulatory and economic battles. Here is a summary of the most notable news of the past week around Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, and Solana, etc.\n\nBitcoin Hashrate Reaches All-Time High\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hashrate has reached an all-time high, demonstrating the miners\u2019 resilience and confidence in crypto despite post-Halving concerns. The total computing power deployed surpassed its previous records, supported by technological advancements and a recent increase in BTC price. These factors have compensated for the block reward reduction, strengthening the mining ecosystem. This performance underscores Bitcoin\u2019s robustness and reassures investors about its long-term fundamentals.\n\nBlackRock Invests $10 Million in Ethereum for Its New ETF\n\nBlackRock, the asset management giant, is preparing to launch an Ethereum ETF, following the success of its Bitcoin ETF. The company invested $10 million to purchase Ether to create a fund with an initial net asset value of $10 million. The ETF, which will be traded under the ticker ETHA, will have the Bank of New York Mellon as the custodian and Coinbase as the holder of the underlying Ether. The ETF\u2019s launch is expected by the end of June, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nXRP ETF: Imminent Approval, According to Ripple\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, announced at the Consensus 2024 conference that the approval of an XRP ETF is inevitable, despite current regulatory challenges. This prediction follows that of Standard Chartered, which anticipates an XRP ETF launch by 2025. Although the crypto is currently down, trading below $0.549, optimism around the ETF could be a game changer. Regulatory clarity remains crucial, and a favorable decision for Ripple in its legal battle against the SEC could accelerate institutional adoption of XRP.\n\nChangpeng Zhao of Binance Incarcerated for 4 Months\n\nThe founder of the crypto exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao, has been incarcerated for four months in a low-security federal prison in Lompoc, California, after admitting his responsibility in money laundering operations via his platform. This sentence, shorter than the three years required by prosecutors, marks a decisive turning point for the crypto sector. Zhao expressed his regrets and acknowledged the importance of regulatory compliance. The future of Binance, under new leadership, is full of uncertainties.\n\nBitcoin: Institutional Frenzied Accumulation Resumes\n\nLarge institutional investors reiterate their strategy of Bitcoin accumulation, reminiscent of the pre-bull rally period of 2020. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, reported a strong activity similar to what was observed before the price surge in late 2020, with daily transactions exceeding a billion dollars. Although volatility is moderate, this accumulation could signal a new bullish cycle. Analysts are divided on the immediate consequences, but many anticipate that Bitcoin could break through the $69,000 resistance, paving the way for new highs.\n\nThat\u2019s the main takeaway for this week.

        "content": "Tue 04 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe stars seem perfectly aligned for Ethereum to start an explosive trajectory in the coming weeks! Indeed, since the approval of Ether ETFs in the United States on May 23, no less than 3 billion dollars of this digital currency have been massively withdrawn from centralized exchange platforms. A signal potentially announcing a shortage of supply in the crypto market!\n\nCrypto: The dangerous decline of Ethereum reserves!\n\nThe latest figures couldn\u2019t be clearer. Between May 23 and June 2, approximately 797,000 Ethers worth 3.02 billion dollars were siphoned off from the reserves of centralized exchange platforms. In other words, crypto investors have significantly reduced the available liquidity for an immediate sale.\n\nThis massive capital movement had the immediate effect of further reducing the circulating supply of Ether. And precisely, the very latest data from the analysis company Glassnode are very telling in this regard! According to their estimates, the percentage of the total supply of Ether currently held on exchange platforms has dropped to only 10.6%. Its lowest level in history for years!\n\nCrypto: the total supply of ethereum\n\nAn ideal ingredient for a new surge in prices\n\nNormally, this very dangerous decline of reserves available could dramatically exacerbate the buying pressure on the Ether markets. Although contrary to the ideal of decentralization, this sudden contraction of the circulating supply has often been a precursor to powerful speculative bullish movements in the crypto sector.\n\nAnd the opportunity couldn\u2019t be more perfect at a time when the highly anticipated launch of Ether ETFs on the stock exchange is drawing closer. According to crypto analysts, this start of negotiations could even be a \u201clegitimate possibility\u201d by the end of June!\n\nAn already palpable enthusiasm that has not escaped the experts. Many are already predicting a scenario of spectacular surge for Ether, similar to that observed for Bitcoin after the start of BTC ETF negotiations last January.\n\nUndeniably, all indicators seem to point to Ethereum soaring to new stratospheric heights in the very near future. The prospect of the first regulated ETFs combined with the severe contraction of its available supply could trigger an unprecedented buying frenzy. A golden opportunity for bold investors, but also a major risk of a devastating speculative bubble if euphoria were to take hold.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "SEC Chair Gensler Hints at Slower S-1 Approval for Ethereum ETFs - CoinGape",
        "content": "The path to launching spot Ethereum ETFs appears to be extending, as SEC Chair Gary Gensler suggests that the approval of the necessary S-1 forms \u201cwill take some time.\u201d\n\nThis development follows the recent approval of 19b-4 forms but indicates a potentially prolonged finalization phase for the S-1 forms, essential for the ETFs to commence trading.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGensler\u2019s Comments on S-1 Approval for Ethereum ETFs\n\nIn an interview on CNBC in relation to a digital assets subcommittee hearing, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said that the further steps for the ETF approval involving Ethereum are not close at hand. This statement has been made amidst the SEC\u2019s instructions to issuers to submit their draft S-1 filings by last Friday.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: @SECGov Chairman @GaryGensler says the next step in the $ETH ETF approvals \u201cwill take some time,\u201d possibly indicating a potential slow-walk of the S-1 approval process. https://t.co/iwfN9vvmt8 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 5, 2024\n\nAfter this submission, the SEC should give its first feedback which will in turn prompt more changes to be made. From the insiders of the industry, it is expected that this iterative process may take several weeks or at most several months.\n\nThis was evidenced by the fact that key financial institutions like VanEck and BlackRock filed updated S-1 forms following the approval of the 19b-4 forms on May 23. BlackRock elaborately explained that its ETF would have an initial asset of $10 million, which demonstrates the preparedness and the capital support for these strategies.\n\nEthereum ETF Market Impact and Investor Expectations\n\nThere is much excitement around the ETH ETFs, especially due to the possibility of large amounts of capital flowing into the market. As per a report from K33 Research, spot Ethereum ETFs could fetch $4 billion investments in the first five months of their launch.\n\nThis estimate is derived from comparing the Bitcoin product with other BTC offerings and the increasing institutional demand seen through trading in Ethereum futures on the CME.\n\nIt is anticipated that this inflow will contribute to a large part of the circulating Ethereum supply, which will further decrease the supply in the market. K33 Research also expects that the arrival of these ETFs will lead to a new all-time high in ETH prices because such products have been associated with similar market trends in the past.\n\nRegulatory Steps and Market Readiness\n\nThus, the detailed review process that the SEC is currently using in its interactions with ETF issuers indicates the commission\u2019s prudent approach to regulating these important financial instruments.\n\nThe longer review period also implies detailed consideration, which might be attributed to the intricate structure of the underlying assets and the potential regulatory difficulties related to them.\n\nCompanies like BlackRock have moved swiftly, indicating a strong market demand and readiness among established financial entities to embrace these new investment vehicles. Meanwhile, the withdrawal of proposals by some firms, such as Hashdex, highlights the varying levels of preparedness and strategic repositioning within the industry\n\nRead Also: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tipped To Hit $500,000 In 2025 By S2F Creator PlanB\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.

        "title": "Ethereum weekly inflows hit $34 million \u2013 Are ETFs the reason? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Year-to-date inflows into crypto products have surpassed $15 billion.\n\nEthereum recorded its second week of inflows.\n\nDigital asset investment products recorded inflows totaling $185 million last week, marking the fourth consecutive week of inflows, digital asset investment firm CoinShares found in its new report.\n\nAlthough this marked an 82% decline from the $1.05 billion recorded in inflows the previous week, it still pushed May\u2019s inflows to $2 billion. Also, it brought the year-to-date (YTD) inflows into cryptocurrency funds above the $15 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the digital asset investment firm, trading volumes declined during the week under review. They totaled $8 billion, a 38% drop from the $13 billion registered the previous week.\n\nAt the end of the week, as observed by CoinShares, the total assets under management (AUM) for crypto-based investment products were above $97 billion. This was a 1.3% decline from the $98.43 billion recorded the previous week.\n\nRegionally, most of last week\u2019s flows into crypto funds came from the U.S. According to CoinShares:\n\n\u201cThe majority of inflows were from the US, seeing a net US$130m, although incumbent ETF issuer outflows rose to US$260m. Switzerland saw its second largest week on inflows this year at US$36m, while Canada saw a turnaround with inflows of US$25m despite seeing a net outflow in May totaling US$39m.\u201d\n\nLuck smiles on Ethereum\n\nSince the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first set of applications for spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from Grayscale, Bitwise, iShares, VanEck, Ark Invest, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton on 22nd May, ETH-based products have recorded significant inflows.\n\nThe week under review was the same. According to CoinShares\u2019 report, Ethereum-backed products recorded their second week of inflows, which amounted to $34 million.\n\nThis represented 18% of all inflows recorded during that period. Also, last week\u2019s liquidity flows into Ethereum pushed the altcoin\u2019s YTD inflows to $11 million.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nCoinShares said:\n\n\u201cThis represents a turnaround in investor sentiment in an asset that had seen a 10-week run of outflows prior, totaling US$200m.\u201d\n\nCoinShares found that last week\u2019s inflows in Ethereum impacted Solana [SOL] due to the statistically positive correlation between them."

        "title": "What Will Happen If VanEck\u2019s Ethereum Price Prediction of $22,000 Comes True? - CoinGape",
        "content": "How huge this will be when the ETH, which is trading below the $4k range, reaches the $22,000 mark. For some, it might be impossible, but analyzing Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the years raises hopes and makes it not necessarily impossible. Moreover, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency in the market, both in popularity and its market cap, so the prediction might come true. But what is the deal with this Ethereum price prediction, and what will happen if the price reaches the $22,000 mark? Let us discuss that in this blog.\n\nVanEck Claims Ethereum Price To Surge To $22,000 By 2030\n\nVanEck, a famous Wall Street Investment Manager, is an Ethereum enthusiast who believes that,\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as \u2018Digital Oil\u2019 because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, as he has recently posted on X revealing the Ethereum prediction, which states that the Ethereum price will surge to $22,000 by the year 2030 under the influence of the Ethereum ETF. VanEck and the team are trying to enter the Ethereum ETF market by listing their ETF and are quite enthusiastic about it.\n\nEven before the ETH ETF approval, he had predicted that the ETFs might generate $3.1 to $4.8 Billion in inflows within the first five months of listing. And now, after the approval, he posted a prediction about the Ethereum price considering the influence of the Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe post says \u201cWe\u2019ve raised our 2030 ETH price target to $22,000, influenced by ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of on-chain data.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve raised our 2030 ETH price target to $22K, influenced by ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of onchain data. Additionally, we\u2019ve analyzed how ETH and BTC perform in both traditional and crypto-only portfolios for optimal returns. @Matthew_Sigel @Patrick_Bush_VE\u2026 \u2014 VanEck (@vaneck_us) June 5, 2024\n\nHe further provides a detailed report authorized by Denis Zinoview, Matthew Sigel, and Patrick Bush, explaining how this will be possible. This target of $22,000 is the base price target. The report actually included the bullish and the bearish price targets of $154,000 and $360.\n\nWhat Will Happen If This Prediction Comes True?\n\nEthereum is among the biggest digital economies, where 20 Million monthly users stay active on the network. In a year\u2019s interval, it has processed $4 trillion worth of transactions and the transfers of stablecoins worth around $5.5 Trillion. Moreover, it has a value of $3,849.92 with $462 Billion in market capitalization and $13.9 Billion in trading volume, highlighting its dominance in the market.\n\nIf VanEck\u2019s Ethereum price prediction comes true, it will become an economy worth $2.6 Trillion. This will become even bigger than Bitcoin, which has $1.3 Trillion with a BTC price of $71K. Every trader who holds Ethereum will make six times the value, creating millionaires and billionaires.\n\nFor example, a person who has invested $10,000 to buy Ethereum at the current price, this investment will get around 2.6ETH tokens. Once the price rises to $22,000, the same 2.59ETH will be worth $57,142, making $47,142 in profits. The calculation can continue, and the 20,000 investment will make $94,285 in profits, $50,000 will make $235,714 in profits, etc.\n\nCan Ethereum Price Surge to $22,000?\n\nVanEck\u2019s prediction is supported by multiple factors, including the dominance of Ethereum among all the Smart Contracts platforms. He has also envisioned a way to generate $66 Billion in cash flows, which will generated by the network to support this $2.2 trillion of capitalization after the ETH price hits $22,00.\n\nHe has highlighted that this surge to $22,000 will be driven by many growth factors, including the blockchain\u2019s utility, the growth of digital finance, and AI by 2030.\n\nHowever, some constraints make it a little challenging to envision such huge growth. Ethereum price is almost one-sixth of the $22,000 prediction and has not achieved anywhere closer to that. Though Ethereum is among the highly demanded networks, it will be challenging to surge that high.\n\nMoreover, the continuous fear of being classified as a Security will always be haunting. The SEC has approved the Ethereum ETF, but the classification is still uncertain. If Ethereum gets classified as Security, it will constrain the development and price of the ETH.\n\nContinue Reading Can BNB Price Surge Any Higher Than This New ATH?

        "content": "In a recent market analysis, QCP Capital has highlighted significant bullish momentum in the crypto market, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC) price. However, QCP Capital expects Ethereum (ETH) to grab the spotlight. In their report, they highlighted that Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has experienced a robust 15-day inflow streak.\n\nQCP Capital Prediction On Bitcoin & Ethereum\n\nThe Bitcoin ETFs witnessed an influx of $886.1 million on Tuesday, June 4. This marked the second-largest inflow since its inception. Moreover, this substantial inflow has been accompanied by notable activity in the options market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFurthermore, QCP Capital observed considerable buying interest in Bitcoin call options expiring in June. Hence, this trend indicates strong bullish sentiment. Moreover, the Bitcoin price is positioning for a potential breakout above the all-time high of $74,000 this month.\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis suggests that market participants are gearing up for a decisive move, reflecting confidence in Bitcoin price\u2019s continued upward trajectory. However, while Bitcoin has been at the forefront of this recent surge, Ethereum has been trailing behind.\n\nDespite this lag, QCP Capital anticipates that ETH could soon catch up and possibly even outperform the Bitcoin price surge. The rally will particularly be witnessed when the Spot Ethereum ETF begins trading, stated QCP Capital. The firm posits that the introduction of an Ethereum ETF could trigger significant rotations of funds from Bitcoin to Ether, providing additional upward momentum for the latter.\n\nAlso Read: Bull Run: Can Crypto Market Reach $3 Trillion, With Bitcoin Price Above $71,000?\n\nAdvise On Capitalizing ETH Surge\n\nQCP Capital has also proposed a strategic trade to capitalize on this expected Ethereum price rally. They recommend achieving high convexity exposure to an Ethereum price increase in the near term through Zero Cost ETH September Knock-In, Knock-Out (KIKO) options.\n\nThe trade structure involves a short put strike at $3,500 with a knock-in level at $3,000, and a long call strike at $4,000 with a knock-out level at $6,400. This setup offers a maximum payout of 219.55% per annum or $2,400 per Ethereum if the spot price expires just below $6,400.\n\nHowever, the cost of this trade is zero, but there is a downside risk. If the spot price falls below $3,000 at expiry, the investor must buy ETH at $3,500. As of now, Ethereum price is hovering around $3,700, indicating a bullish outlook in line with QCP Capital\u2019s analysis.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin At $72K Sets $1.5B Liquidation Cascade, Willy Woo Predicts What\u2019s Next\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum is a mixed bag when writing. Even so, the uptrend remains for now. While bulls might be loading up, buying on every correction, traders should be wary of what happens at the $3,700 level. This line is an immediate support zone that bulls must reject for uptrend continuation. Considering the formation in the daily chart, the path of least resistance is upwards, but buyers must convincingly close above $4,000. If not, ETH prices might consolidate horizontally in continuation of last week\u2019s formation.\n\nThe general inactivity in price action means bulls seem to be slowing down. For now, Ethereum is stable in the past 24 hours but down 3% in the past week. Since prices are quite literally stuck, engagement is also low. At the time of writing, the average trading volume in the last 24 hours is around $14 billion, which is way lower than expected.\n\nNonetheless, traders are closely monitoring fundamental events. The following Ethereum developments are noteworthy:\n\nFollowing a hack, Linea, an Ethereum layer-2 platform , chose to shut down the sequencer to prevent more losses. Critics are now raining down on its developers, claiming it is not a blockchain but a centralized scaling solution.\n\nAnalysts think ETH bulls are preparing for a super-cycle in the coming weeks. As the United States SEC prepares to approve spot ETFs , over 800,000 ETH have been withdrawn from top exchanges.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nETH/USD prices are consolidating inside a wedge, printing a bull flag.\n\nStill, even with the lower lows, the uptrend remains.\n\nOptimistic bulls can look for entries to buy on dips above $3,700.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, the accumulation might provide a spring for a decisive breakout above $4,000.\n\nThis development will align with the May 20 bull bar that continues to shape the current price action.\n\nA close in either direction ($3,700 or $4,100) is crucial for trend definition.\n\nIf bulls succeed, Ethereum would quickly explode to as high as $4,900."

        "content": "The introduction of Ethereum ETFs sent waves throughout the cryptocurrency market. Several projects saw significant gains, with Ethereum rallying over 20% in just one week. But how does Ethereum compare to Cardano and Rollblock? Being significantly more affordable projects, Cardano and Rollblock could make better investments. Experts believe that both projects will rally throughout the upcoming bull run, and in the process, they could offer higher returns.\n\nEthereum Soars 28% Following ETF Update\n\nThe SEC recently approved eight Ethereum ETF applications. This is a huge milestone for the cryptocurrency market and sent Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume soaring to over $47 billion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has also rallied since this update. Over the past week Ethereum\u2019s price increased by 28.7%, and ETH is now trading at $3,816. This bullish momentum temporarily made Ethereum the second most traded cryptocurrency and has resulted in bullish predictions.\n\nAccording to Daniel Bernstein, Ethereum could hit a new all-time high of $6,000 by the end of Q2, and as a result investors are keeping a sharp eye on ETH developments.\n\nCardano Founder Critiques Bitcoin\n\nIn a recent interview Charles Hoskinson called into question Bitcoin\u2019s future. He argued that Bitcoin is now reliant on the broader DeFi ecosystem, stating that it could be replaced by an asset with greater security and functionality.\n\nHoskinson believes that Cardano\u2019s native currency, ADA, is a better alternative. He states that recent Cardano developments make it an ideal candidate, further stating that Cardano is energy efficient and fully decentralized.\n\nThat said, Cardano\u2019s price has increased by just 1.16% over the last month. As a result, many investors believe that Cardano has lost its appeal and are instead choosing other altcoins to boost their portfolios.\n\nStage 2 Of The Rollblock Presale Sells Out\n\nAfter a massive surge in new investors, stage two of the Rollblock presale has quickly sold out. Rollblock\u2019s returns have now hit 40%, and experts believe this is just the start of the project's growth.\n\nRollblock is a market disruptor. It looks to replace current systems in the casino market using blockchain technology.

The price movement has been fairly volatile, yet it is currently in a position that hints at potential bullish momentum. The stochastic oscillator is approaching a positive overlap, suggesting that buying pressure might increase, potentially driving the price higher in the short term.\n\nThe next significant price target for Ethereum is projected to be US$4096.85. This bullish outlook remains valid as long as the price does not break below the crucial support level of US$3641.85. If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, the bullish trend is expected to continue."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s performance in Q2 was unprofitable, indicating a difficult quarter.\n\nWhales and retail investors took some profits as prices surged.\n\nEthereum [ETH] witnessed a surge in price and popularity over the last few days following the announcement of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nA disappointing quarter\n\nDespite this, the ecosystem was not doing too well. Token Terminal\u2019s data indicated that Ethereum was having an unprofitable Q2.\n\nIf Ethereum continues to have problems generating revenue, it would make it much harder for the network to sell its holdings.\n\nHowever, interest in ETH remained relatively high.\n\nFollowing the 23rd May approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds ETFs in the United States, more than $3 billion worth of Ethereum was withdrawn from centralized crypto exchanges, indicating a potential supply squeeze.\n\nData showed that the amount of Ethereum on exchanges decreased by around 797,000, or $3.02 billion, between 23rd May and 2nd June.\n\nThis reduction in exchange reserves implies fewer ETH is available for sale as investors move their assets to self-custody for purposes other than immediate selling.\n\nEthereum\u2019s supply on exchanges was now at its lowest level in years, just 10.6%. This reduction in supply, coupled with a surge in demand from investors post numerous ETF approvals could further boost the price of ETH and nudge it towards its all time high (ATH).\n\nNevertheless, concerns linger that Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which manages $11 billion in funds, could impact Ethereum\u2019s price action. This is based on the example of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $6.5 billion in outflows within the first month of its approval.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,833.59 and its price had grown by 1.19% in the last 24 hours. Surprisingly, both whale interest and retail interest dipped slightly over the last few days.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that cohorts holding anywhere between 0.01 ETH to 10 ETH had witnessed a decline in overall ETH held by them.\n\nMoreover, the addresses holding more that amount also let go of some of their ETH.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis behavior exhibited by both whales and retail investors indicated that a lot of holders were indulging in some level of profit taking as prices soared.\n\nHowever, the sell offs have not been significant enough to impact prices negatively."

        "content": "Solana and Ethereum saw varying volumes of daily active addresses.\n\nThe ETH TVL has remained ahead of SOL\u2019s by considerable volume.\n\nAccording to a recent report, Solana [SOL] had more activity than Ethereum [ETH] in the past 24 hours. Additionally, this increase in activity led to Solana experiencing higher trading volume than Ethereum.\n\nData showed that Solana had a busy 24 hours, with impressive numbers in some key metrics. Solana had more active addresses than Ethereum and Bitcoin combined, the two largest networks.\n\nA deeper analysis of both platforms revealed a significant divergence in their active addresses over the past few days.\n\nComparing Solana and Ethereum\n\nAn analysis of Solana\u2019s active addresses on its scanner revealed an interesting trend. The chart showed that in the past few weeks, the network\u2019s lowest number of active addresses remained above 800,000.\n\nThe chart indicated that the number of active addresses had surpassed 1 million at the time of this writing. This suggests that the network has been experiencing increased activity recently.\n\nHowever, the analysis of Ethereum\u2019s active addresses showed a decline over the past few weeks. The chart revealed that the number of active addresses remained below 500,000 throughout the previous month.\n\nIt gradually decreased to the 400,000 range and has not risen above this level in recent days. According to data from Santiment, the number of active addresses was approximately 141,000 at the time of this writing.\n\nSolana trumps Ethereum volume\n\nAnalysis of the volume trends of both networks on DefiLlama showed that Ethereum has had higher volumes than Solana in the past few weeks. However, at one point, Solana\u2019s volume surged past Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nAs of this writing, Solana\u2019s network volume was around $1.1 billion, while Ethereum\u2019s was around $1.5 billion. This indicates that ETH\u2019s volume has declined while SOL\u2019s network volume has maintained momentum.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s worth noting that ETH\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) remains higher than SOL\u2019s. According to DefiLlama, ETH\u2019s TVL was over $65 billion, while SOL\u2019s TVL was around $4.8 billion.\n\nETH and SOL see varying bull trends\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum on a daily timeframe chart showed that it has remained in a bull trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above 60 at the time of this writing, indicating a strong trend.\n\nHowever, its price has not seen significant movement in the last few days. Previously, ETH experienced a daily decline of less than 1% for the past two days. As of this writing, it was trading at around $1,877, with an increase of less than 1%.\n\nRead Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAnalysis of Solana\u2019s RSI showed that it rested on the neutral line at the time of this writing. This indicates that while Solana is still in a bull trend, it is currently weak.\n\nAs of this writing, Solana was trading at around $165, with an increase of less than 1%.

        "content": "DEX volume fell to $1.03 billion, however, indicators revealed that ETH\u2019s price could jump.\n\nThe liquidation levels suggested that the altcoin could leave more shorts in liquidations.\n\nActivity on Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Decentralized Exchanges has been declining for the past seven days, AMBCrypto confirmed. On the 28th of May, based on data from Messari, the volume was $3.34 billion.\n\nHowever, press time data showed that the DEX volume was down to $1.03 billion\u2014 A $2.21 billion decrease. An increase in the volume on DEXes would have implied more liquidity for Ethereum.\n\nSince it fell, it means that on-chain trades involving ETH were no longer as much as they were last week. Another interpretation points to decreased demand for the altcoin.\n\nA \u201cslight\u201d fall is not the end\n\nWith decreasing demand, ETH could find it challenging to experience a major price increase. At press time, the price of ETH was $3,763, representing a 3.50% decrease within the last week.\n\nThe underwhelming price action is one of the reasons some participants share the opinion that Ethereum might not be a significant part of the bull market.\n\nHowever, AMBCrypto found that the opinion was not factual. This was because of the signals shown by the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z Score. The MVRV has a strong correlation with price.\n\nAs a result, it shows when a cryptocurrency is in bearish or bullish phase. If the score if negative, it means that the asset is in a bear phase. From the chart below, the last time ETH was in such condition was in October 2023, meaning that the token had moved into the bull phase.\n\nAt press time, the MVRV Z Score was 1.63. A look at the peak of previous bull cycles like in 2017 and 2021 showed that the metric hit. 14.19 and 4.76 respectively. If the pattern was to repeat itself, then it mean Ethereum\u2019s price could climb higher.\n\nBut that is for the long term. In the short term, AMBCrypto analyzed the liquidation levels. The liquidation level is the price an exchange forcefully close a trader\u2019s position.\n\nBears beware! ETH looks ready to recover\n\nThe rationale behind this is to prevent further losses. At press time, Ethereum\u2019s large-scale liquidations could take place between $3,882 up to $3,946. This implied that price could move toward the mentioned region.\n\nFurthermore, we checked the Cumulative Liquidations Levels Delta (CLLD). A positive value of this reading implies that there are more long liquidations. A negative reading suggests that short liquidations were dominance.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nLooking at the chart, the CLLD was negative, and short liquidations in the last seven days has been over $59 million.\n\nBut concerning the price, the negative CLLD is bullish for ETH as late short might fail to catch the dip. In this instance, ETH might recover, and the projection to $3,946 could be come to pass."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) saw a significant upswing at the end of May due to the rumors of a spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Funds) approval in the US. This bullish momentum propelled the token\u2019s price from the $3,000 price range to the $3,900 mark.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAfter the approval, the second-largest cryptocurrency has shown a strong performance, consolidating between the $3,700 and $3,800 levels. Some crypto analysts believe ETH is preparing for a crucial test and eye bullish targets above the $10,000 price range soon.\n\nETH\u2019s \u201cGlorious Year\u201d Depends On This Level\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Jelle, a community sector is currently driven by a negative sentiment towards Ethereum. The bearish sentiment, seemingly fueled by Ethereum\u2019s failure to regain the $4,000 resistance level, has made \u201clots of people overcomplicate things here.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Jelle urged investors not to panic, arguing there\u2019s no reason to \u201cflip bearish.\u201d The crypto analyst highlighted the key movements the King of Altcoins has seen in the past two weeks.\n\nDue to the spot ETH ETF approval, Ethereum broke out of a multi-moth falling wedge pattern. At the time, ETH successfully regained the $3,600 price range and briefly tested the $3,900 price range.\n\nAfter reclaiming this key support level, ETH has been consolidating above it, hovering between the $3,700 and $3,800 price range since May 28. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency is \u201creclaiming the range lows of a 3-year-long reaccumulation range.\u201d\n\nPer Jelle\u2019s chart, ETH is regaining the lowest range of the previous bull run, which could lead to an expansion period. If the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization holds above this key level, Ethereum \u201cwill have a glorious year.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the analyst considers that ETH\u2019s last hurdle to overcome this cycle is the $4,000 resistance level. Once \u201cit breaks $4,000, it\u2019s clear skies ahead\u201d to potentially reach the price target of $10,000.\n\nSimilarly, known crypto analyst Il Capo of Crypto noted that his main scenario is a bullish continuation. Per Il Capo, Ethereum is \u201clooking good\u201d above the $3,650 range. This performance seemingly sets the cryptocurrency for a \u201cbullish continuation\u201d towards the previous cycle\u2019s all-time high (ATH).\n\nEthereum ETFs, The Catalyst For New ATH?\n\nDespite the doubts, Ethereum\u2019s recent performance resembles Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) in previous cycles. According to crypto trader Ash, ETH is following the path of the flagship cryptocurrency in 2018-2021. If it continues this track, \u201c$10,000+ ETH is programmed.\u201d\n\nAs the crypto market awaits the listing of the spot ETF, some analysts consider it the catalyst for an \u201cexplosive\u201d alt season this year.\n\nSimilarly, Ali Martinez noted that over 777,000 ETH, worth around $3 billion, have been withdrawn from exchanges since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the investment products. Due to a supply squeeze, this development could propel ETH\u2019s price to higher levels.\n\nHowever, Lookonchain recently revealed that two participants of Ethereum\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) deposited around 4.5% of their holdings on a crypto exchange. Per the post, the ICO participants received 200,000 ETH, worth around $767 million, at Ethereum\u2019s Genesis.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe Half-Million Dollar Bitcoin: Predictions Point To Monumental Price Surge In 18 Months 3 months ago\n\nThe holders deposited 9,518 ETH, or $36.33 million, into Kraken on Monday, which has alarmed investors. Despite the fear of a possible dump, some community members think this movement could suggest that these long-term holders believe ETH\u2019s price will reach unprecedented highs soon.\n\nFeatured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has been a topic of constant debate and speculation in the cryptocurrency market. Currently trading at $3,750, Ethereum has seen a significant rise compared to the beginning of the year and as June draws to a close, many investors are left wondering where Ethereum\u2019s price is heading.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Bullish Outlook\n\nOne interesting take comes from ChatGPT, a large language model known for its ability to process information and generate text faster. When prompted about Ethereum\u2019s price on June 30th, 2024, ChatGPT offered a bullish prediction.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to remember that ChatGPT isn\u2019t specifically designed for financial forecasting, its analysis suggests a potential increase to $4,500, representing a roughly 20% jump from the current price.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving Ethereum\u2019s Rise?\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent rise can be attributed to a confluence of factors. The Dencun upgrade rolled out in April, improved efficiency and lowered transaction costs, making the network more attractive.\n\nThis upgrade is a stepping stone for future scalability enhancements. Additionally, the thriving DeFi and NFT markets built on Ethereum, fuel demand for ETH as their popularity surges.\n\nNews and Developments Shaping Ethereum\u2019s Future\n\nBeyond the immediate price predictions, other developments could shape Ethereum\u2019s long-term trajectory. Here are a few key areas to watch:\n\nThe Rise of Layer-2 Solutions: Layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to handle transactions faster and cheaper. Continued growth and adoption of these solutions could alleviate congestion on the mainnet and contribute to overall network growth.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: While significant hurdles remain, 2024 has seen increased interest from institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. If major financial institutions embrace Ethereum, it could provide a significant boost to its price and market cap.\n\nWe are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 \u2014 TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023\n\nA Word of Caution\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. While ChatGPT\u2019s prediction and the current trends paint a promising picture for Ethereum, investors must conduct their research and understand the inherent risks involved before making investment decisions.\n\nWhether Ethereum reaches the $4,500 mark by June 30th as ChatGPT suggests remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: Ethereum\u2019s future holds immense potential. It will be fascinating to see how it unfolds in the coming months and years.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and Google News"
