        "title": "ProShares Introduce SETH, World\u2019s First Ethereum Inverse ETF - TronWeekly",
        "content": "ProShares has taken a groundbreaking step in the world of cryptocurrency investment by introducing the first-ever Ethereum inverse ETF. Known as the ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and traded under the ticker symbol SETH, this innovative ETF aims to generate returns inversely correlated to the daily performance of its underlying index, the Standard & Poor\u2019s CME Ether Futures Index. What sets SETH apart from other ETFs is its focus on the inverse movement of Ethereum\u2019s price. In simpler terms, this means that as the price of Ethereum decreases, the value of the ETF increases, making it an attractive option for investors with a bearish outlook on Ethereum\u2019s future.\n\nThis introduction comes at a time when traditional spot ETFs are still awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. SETH offers investors a unique opportunity to engage with the volatile crypto market without the complexities of directly shorting the asset. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, SETH marks ProShares\u2019 pioneering venture into the world of inverse ETFs.\n\nProShares Introduce SETH, World's First Ethereum Inverse ETF 3\n\nThe launch of Ethereum ETFs began in early October, with ProShares unveiling three out of a total of nine new products. However, the initial response was lukewarm compared to the enthusiastic reception received by their Bitcoin Strategy ETF in the past. Michael Sapir, the CEO of ProShares, emphasized SETH as a solution to the challenges associated with obtaining short positions in Ether, which often involve cumbersome and costly processes. Sapir stated that SETH was specifically designed to simplify the process of acquiring short exposure to Ether, making it more accessible for investors.\n\nProShares Forefront In Diverse ETFs Launch\n\nProShares, a prominent player in the crypto-linked ETF market, has been leading the ETF revolution since 2006. The company boasts one of the most extensive ETF lineups and manages over $60 billion in assets, along with its affiliates. This recent development follows ProShares\u2019 previous successes in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn June, the company introduced its first short bitcoin-linked ETF in the United States, trading under the ticker BITI. Moreover, in October 2021, ProShares made history by launching BITO, the first US bitcoin-linked ETF, amassing over $1 billion in assets within just two days of its release. Additionally, the ETF issuer pioneered the creation of the first BTC-linked mutual fund, BTCFX, in July 2021, further solidifying its position as an innovative leader in the cryptocurrency investment landscape."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nGoogle Trends data shows that XRP is more popular than Ethereum in 47 US states, with the highest interest coming from Delaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii.\n\nXRP\u2019s price fluctuations throughout 2023 have been influenced by the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, with Ripple\u2019s partial wins in court contributing to a positive trend.\n\nForecasting the future value of XRP varies greatly among analysts, with estimates ranging from a moderate increase to $0.90 by next summer to an extreme prediction of $500, which would require a market capitalization far exceeding the current total crypto market cap.\n\nAmericans are Interested in Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 seems to be a highly intriguing topic for many Americans. According to Google Trends data, the residents of 47 states have displayed higher interest in the asset than Ethereum (ETH).\n\nDelaware, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona, and Hawaii are the regions where XRP is the most popular. On the other hand, Vermont, New York, Oregon, and the District of Columbia are the only areas where Ethereum has surpassed Ripple\u2019s coin.\n\nXRP\u2019s price has gone through numerous ups and downs since the beginning of 2023, experiencing a significant uptrend in the second half of the year. The positive performance could be a result of the developments surrounding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, specifically the three partial wins that the blockchain enterprise has secured so far.\n\nThe outcome of the legal battle, which has been ongoing since December 2020, is expected to be revealed in the spring of 2024 during a grand trial. Multiple analysts and experts have predicted that a decisive win for Ripple could propel a further jump for XRP.\n\nSome of the XRP Forecasts\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user CrediBULL argued that the asset\u2019s valuation could rise to approximately $0.90 by the summer of next year.\n\nWhile such a prediction sounds somewhat realistic, other analysts, like Shannon Thorp, have envisioned astronomical increases. She assumed that XRP could explode to $500 in the following years.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the coin\u2019s market capitalization should spike to over $250 trillion for this to happen. In comparison, the entire market cap of the sector was \u201cjust\u201d $3 trillion in 2021 when many digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), charted all-time highs.\n\nThose curious to check how high XRP could shoot in the remaining months of the ongoing year could take a look at the video below:"

        "title": "Bored Ape Creator Yuga Labs and Magic Eden Launching Ethereum NFT Marketplace That Enforces Royalties - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMulti-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden announced Saturday that it will launch a new Ethereum platform by the end of the year in collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs\u2014with a firm commitment to honor creator royalties on NFT sales.\n\nThe companies said in a statement that Magic Eden will have a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d to pay Yuga Labs its share of secondary market sales of its future NFT collections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much happy to put our money where our mouth is,\u201d Magic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu told Decrypt.\n\nLu said that Magic Eden\u2019s overhauled Ethereum marketplace would use new smart contracts\u2014which contain the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps)\u2014with technical innovations that it says will ensure that royalties are paid out during secondary market sales.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTechnical details will be revealed before the marketplace launches, but Lu did confirm that the standard ERC-721 Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) standard will indeed be in use. NFTs minted with certain \u201cproperties of the marketplace contract\u201d will have royalties enforced.\n\nThe change will not impact the way that traders interact with Magic Eden, Lu said; for example, it does not mean that they\u2019ll have to identify themselves via know-your-customer (KYC) checks.\n\nRoyalties disputes\n\nA creator royalty is a small fee set by the artist or company behind a project and taken from the sale price of any follow-up sale of an NFT. The fee typically ranges between 2.5% and 10% of the sale price, and such fees had initially been widely honored by marketplaces as a way for creators to benefit long-term from their tokenized creations.\n\nBut in the second half of 2022, with NFT sales fading, some upstart marketplaces began using workarounds to let traders skip such creator fees, or pay smaller amounts. Major players then followed suit to keep pace, and prominent marketplace OpenSea ultimately decided to stop enforcing royalties this past August after previously committing to honor such fees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYuga Labs criticized OpenSea in late 2022 when it publicly said it had considered moving away from royalties and came out swinging again this past August after the decision was finalized. The Bored Ape creator said that it planned to stop supporting OpenSea\u2019s marketplace contracts with new collections and those collections with upgradeable contracts.\n\n\u201cObviously, the genesis of this was what we saw happening in the overall ecosystem with secondary royalties,\u201d Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre told Decrypt. \u201cThe gauntlet that unfortunately OpenSea dropped made it very clear to us that we, as a company at the forefront of the NFT space, had to stand up for content creators.\u201d\n\nA press release from Yuga Labs and Magic Eden announcing the news appears to subtly jab at OpenSea, noting that the companies have \u201cmade it unequivocal that respecting creator royalties is non-negotiable, a clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing forward, for new collections, Yuga Labs will exclusively engage with marketplaces that uphold these principles, ensuring fair treatment of creators,\u201d the release notes.\n\nAlegre said that Magic Eden\u2014which is also in a working group with Yuga Labs in OMA3 (the Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3) to improve royalties standards\u2014has pledged to address any loopholes or workarounds with this new technological solution.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t an exclusivity deal with Magic Eden, either. The companies say that other marketplaces can choose to use the same kind of contracts introduced through this collaboration, and that Yuga Labs hopes to see them broadly adopted. Furthermore, other NFT creators can mint their projects using the contracts to adopt similar protections.\n\nShifting strategies\n\nMagic Eden, best known for its original iteration on Solana, is one of those aforementioned marketplaces that switched to optional royalties last year after pressure from rising rivals. The platform also launched an Ethereum NFT marketplace last fall, but eventually took it offline ahead of the planned revival.\n\nLu acknowledged that Magic Eden \u201cwent through our own changes\u201d in regards to royalties enforcement on Solana, but that it always wanted to support creators\u2014it just wanted a \u201ctechnical solution\u201d for that. Such solutions have emerged on Solana over the past year, and now Magic Eden is among the builders trying to enact such standards on Ethereum, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want to be on the right side of history here,\u201d Lu said.\n\nAlegre said that he\u2019s confident that this approach of supporting marketplaces that enforce royalties will work, and that Magic Eden will work to address any shortcomings of the tech once it\u2019s in the wild. But he also admitted that Yuga has another potential way of encouraging traders to use such marketplaces: withholding future benefits for those who buy NFTs elsewhere.\n\nThe Yuga CEO said that the company will \u201cprovide value to holders who engage with the platforms that make the most sense.\u201d Asked if there will be consequences for NFT buyers who purchase Yuga assets from marketplaces that don\u2019t enforce royalties, Alegre replied that his team is \u201cstill thinking through exactly what that means.\u201d\n\nLanded in HK, pumped for Day 1 of #ApeFestHK & to support @yugalabs on this Had to pick out this this clean boy with Magic Eden colors to celebrate. We've been non stop cooking at @MagicEden across all ecosystems lately - Rare Sats & BTC Amsterdam, Tokenized Pokemon Cards &\u2026 https://t.co/sPXt17U83a pic.twitter.com/wMmLRlunub \u2014 Jack Lu (@0xLeoInRio) November 3, 2023\n\n\u201cYou can imagine situations where we say, \u2018Look, if the last trade was done on a certain platform, then certain benefits in ongoing engagement or ongoing experiences may actually not accrue to the holder of that asset,\u2019\u201d Alegre explained. But he said that Yuga would rather not \u201cput the onus on the consumer\u201d to deal with that because it becomes \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ideal way is actually to ensure that you're working with the right partner,\u201d he said of Magic Eden, \u201cand you direct as much traffic as you possibly can to that partner.\u201d\n\nThat ability to restrict perks and benefits to NFT holders is framed as a potential backup plan for now\u2014a nuclear option, if needed. But Alegre and team hope instead that Magic Eden\u2019s approach will prove to be the solution to flagging creator royalties enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe're confident in the capabilities of Magic Eden,\u201d Alegre told Decrypt. \u201cWe're obviously leaning in very heavily into this partnership, and we have full trust in Jack and his leadership team. And for now, that\u2019s the approach that we're going to take.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Since the onset of November, Ethereum has experienced heightened volatility with the $1830 level proving to be a formidable resistance, impeding its upward trajectory. This resistance has led to two weeks of indecisive trading, as evidenced by long-wicked candles which reflect the market\u2019s current uncertainty. Investors are pondering whether this consolidation could usher in another bearish downturn.\n\nAlso Read: US Seizes $54 Mln Crypto, Including Ethereum, In Narcotics Scheme\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs a Correction Underway?\n\nThe channel pattern leads to the current consolidation in the ETH price\n\nA bearish breakdown channel pattern would set the price at 16%.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 27% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ongoing recovery in the Ethereum price journey initiated from the mid-October low of $1522 to a three-month high of $1874, amounting to a 23% increase. Nonetheless, this rally brought it to a resistance level that aligns with the upper trendline long-standing wedge pattern, potentially introducing a new supply zone for the market participants.\n\nMirroring the Bitcoin price consolidation, the ETH price is encountering substantial selling pressure around the $1830 threshold, as suggested by the long-wicked rejection candles. However, a detailed analysis at shorter timeframes, reveals a rising channel pattern demarcated by two ascending trendlines.\n\nShould this pattern hold, we might see this altcoin oscillate within the $1800 to $1880 band, indicating a moderate bullish continuation.\n\nFrom a bearish viewpoint, a breach below the channel\u2019s lower boundary could precipitate a short-term downturn for Ethereum. The Fibonacci Retracement Tool delineates critical support levels at $1750 (corresponding to the 38.2% Fibonacci level) and $1700 (at the 50% retracement mark).\n\nA retracement to these zones could potentially be a precursor to a renewed ascension above the $1880 threshold, maintaining the larger bullish narrative.\n\n1 ETH to USD = $2656.323 0.95% (24h) ETH btc\n\nbtc eth\n\neth xrp\n\nxrp bnb\n\nbnb sol\n\nsol ltc\n\nltc polygon\n\npolygon cardano\n\ncardano tron\n\ntron doge\n\ndoge WETH\n\nWETH LUNC\n\nLUNC XMR\n\nXMR LIRA\n\nLIRA BITS\n\nBITS IHINU\n\nIHINU SWEAT\n\nSWEAT PI\n\nPI SATS\n\nSATS ILV\n\nILV BDX\n\nBDX MCOIN USD USD\n\nUSD INR\n\nINR JPY\n\nJPY CNY\n\nCNY GBP\n\nGBP EUR\n\nCan the ETH Price Fall Back to $1500?\n\nEthereum\u2019s daily chart over the last seven months illustrates a methodical pullback within the confines of a descending wedge pattern. The latest uptick was a part of this pattern, testing both of its boundaries.
