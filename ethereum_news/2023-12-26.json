        "title": "Three privacy-focused Ethereum L2s arising in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Several crypto startups are looking to develop the first-ever privacy-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nOn Ethereum today, transactions and other smart contract executions are all publicly visible. Transparency is a core principle of blockchain technology, meant to allow verification of systems and instill confidence, but it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nWhile transparency ensures accountability, it also means that the details of these transactions and contracts are exposed to everyone, including malicious actors and hackers who can analyze transaction patterns, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code, and exploit these weaknesses for nefarious purposes.\n\nPrivacy solutions offer dapp developers the opportunity to build applications that shore up these shortcomings without compromising security.\n\nIn the process, these privacy-first applications must endeavor to prevent harmful actors from concealing their identities, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. In short, to avoid the fate of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which allegedly was used to launder over $455 million stolen by sanctioned North Korean hackers.\n\nRead More: Tornado Cash Developer\u2019s Arrest Sparks Protest in Amsterdam\n\nHere are a few teams that are hoping to build a functioning privacy-centric L2:\n\nAztec\n\nAztec is a privacy layer of Ethereum. It\u2019s referred to as a hybrid solution using zkSNARKs and its very own programming language, Noir, to offer private transfers, meaning that the network is designed to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them, such as the amount and parties involved.\n\nUnlike other zero-knowledge (zk) rollups on Ethereum, Aztec combines private and public execution in one single zk rollup. Meaning that a user\u2019s own device is responsible for encrypting the transactions before it is processed by the blockchain.\n\nIts primary focus, for now, is to design a platform for engineers to write private smart contracts without requiring in-depth mathematical knowledge of zk proofs. It recently revealed a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox, for interested developers and plans for a testnet launch early next year.\n\nFhenix\n\nEncryption start-up Fhenix hopes to bring fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to smart contracts.\n\nUnlike privacy startups that use zero-knowledge technology, where data must be moved off-chain and decrypted in order for a prover to verify its accuracy, FHE encryption performs computations directly on encrypted data.\n\nBy keeping data on chain, the network will have the capability to process computations that come from various sources, such as an on-chain poker game or a sealed-bid auction contract.\n\nFhenix launched a developer testnet in July and plans for a full-scale testnet launch of its FHE rollup in early 2024.\n\nCOTI\n\nCOTI is a privacy L2 building on Ethereum. Unlike Aztec, which uses zkSNARKS and Fhenix with FHE, COTI V2 will use so-called Garbled Circuits to enable private transactions.\n\nGarbled Circuits enable two different parties to evaluate information, even if they distrust one another. The parties can each submit their \u2018garbled\u2019 or encrypted inputs, computations are conducted on these inputs and an outcome is obtained.\n\nCOTI will launch a developer testnet V2 in Q2 of 2024, and its mainnet launch will come soon after.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee Concept Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Why Do We Need Gas in the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nGas\u2019s primary function is to reduce ETH\u2019s volatility. ETH is publicly tradeable and listed on exchanges. As a result, it is directly subject to market volatility. Petrol is not listed on any exchange, so it is not directly affected by market volatility. An Ethereum smart contract requires more computational power than a straightforward transfer. In order to avoid instability, the fee must be meticulously designed.\n\nHow Is the Gas Price Determined?\n\nGas price is determined by two factors: the gas limit and the price of gas. The sender\u2019s gas limit is the utmost amount of gas they are willing to pay for the transaction. The cost of gas is determined by market supply and demand. The final gas price for the transaction is calculated by multiplying the two prices.\n\nGas Limit * Gas Price = Gas Fee\n\nGas Limit: Gas Limit is the maximum quantity of ETH that the sender is willing to spend on the transaction. Typically, when discussing Gas in Ethereum, one is referring to Gas Limit. Sending ETH requires the shipper to set Gas Limit. If there is insufficient Gas Limit to complete the transfer, the transfer will be cancelled and the shipper will receive a Gas refund. Alternatively, if the sender specifies an excessive Gas Limit, any excess Gas will be returned to the sender.\n\nGas Price: Gas Price indicates the cost of Gas in Gwei. For instance, 1 Gas equals 10 Gwei. It is primarily determined by supply and demand in the market. Gas Price is multiplied by Gas Limit to ascertain the cost of gas.\n\nWhat Are the Factors Affecting Gas Fees?\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of gas fees involves recognizing the factors that influence their fluctuations:\n\nNetwork Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s popularity has led to network congestion during peak usage times. As more transactions compete for limited block space, gas fees tend to increase.\n\nGas Price: Users can set their preferred gas price. A higher gas price increases the likelihood of a transaction being processed promptly, but it also incurs higher costs.\n\nTransaction Complexity: The computational resources required to execute a transaction or smart contract influence its gas fee. More complex operations demand more gas.\n\nGas Limit: Each Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which represents the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend. If a transaction\u2019s computational requirements exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail, and the user will still be charged.\n\nExternal Events: Market fluctuations, platform upgrades, and major smart contract executions can impact gas fees.\n\nWhat Are the Strategies to Optimize Gas Fees?\n\nNavigating the Ethereum gas fee landscape requires a strategic approach. Consider these tips to optimize your transactions:\n\nGas Estimators: Various online tools and wallets provide gas estimators that recommend a suitable gas price based on network conditions. These estimators help you strike a balance between prompt execution and cost efficiency.\n\nOff-Peak Usage: Initiate transactions during periods of lower network activity. Gas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions: Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain and settling them on-chain. These solutions can significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times.\n\nBatch Transactions: Some wallets and platforms allow users to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch. This approach can save on gas costs, as multiple transactions are processed in a single block.\n\nGas Tokens: Gas tokens are tokens that can be minted when gas prices are low and burned (destroyed) when gas prices are high. This mechanism enables users to hedge against future gas price increases.\n\nSmart Contract Efficiency: Developers can optimize smart contracts to minimize gas consumption. This includes techniques like reducing unnecessary storage operations and using more efficient algorithms.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral aspect of the network\u2019s functionality. While they can present challenges, they are also a testament to Ethereum\u2019s popularity and utility. By understanding the factors that influence gas fees and implementing optimization strategies, users can navigate the Ethereum ecosystem more effectively and make the most of its innovative applications."

        "title": "Anatoly Yakovenko jokes \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in ironic social media exchange - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent exchange on social media, Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko, made a remark that was misinterpreted in our previous coverage.\n\nIn a Dec. 25 tweet, Yakovenko playfully suggested that Solana could be considered an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer. This statement was part of a tongue-in-cheek response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions like Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. He quipped:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the Solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nThis playful assertion was meant to ironically juxtapose Solana, a distinct and independent blockchain, with Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions. The mention of a Wormhole eigenlayer and the speculative reference to submitting Solana blocks to Ethereum were part of this jest.\n\nOur initial report, however, presented it seriously and failed to recognize its ironic nature, and thus our coverage suggested that he meant it in earnest. We sincerely apologize for the error and for any confusion caused by our failure to recognize the ironic intent behind it.\n\nOn the rise\n\nYakovenko\u2019s jesting aside, Solana is poised to close the year on a high note. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "On Dec. 26, crypto YouTuber Lark Davis said, \u201cEthereum is going to make a lot of new millionaires in 2024.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added that those with a lot of ETH, purchased at much lower prices and staked, will do well in the next bull market. But those getting into the market now, with the asset trading over $2,000, are not going to make it big unless they have a lot to invest.\n\nThe big returns will be made trading Ethereum layer-2 assets, he said.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nEthereum to $15,000\n\nLark highlighted a number of current and upcoming layer-2 listings, such as zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia. \u201cNew listings can make money, especially in the short term,\u201d he said.\n\nNewly launched tokens often exhibit pump-and-dump patterns as airdrop hunters offload them quickly. However, there have been several that have begun up trending soon after when they get listed on larger exchanges.\n\nFor the Ethereum hodlers, things could still be good in 2024. He compared gains for ETH from previous cycles and made a prediction for the next bull cycle in 2024 and 2025.\n\nNow that the asset has broken out from its resistance zone at $2,150, \u201cit\u2019s going to do big things.\u201d\n\nIf Ethereum makes similar gains to the last cycle high, or even slightly less, \u201cthat will get us up to around $15,000 per coin.\u201d\n\nThis is on a hypothetical 200% gain from the previous high, which was around $4,880 in November 2021.\n\nFor those buying now, there is a potential 500-600% gain, he said, which is a \u201crelatively low-risk bet for crypto.\u201d\n\nEthereum is very strong fundamentally despite the lack of love recently from the crypto community.\n\nETH Price Outlook\n\nCrypto markets are in retreat this Wednesday in Asia. As a result, ETH prices dropped 2% on the day in a fall to $2,223 at the time of writing.\n\nMoreover, the asset has now declined 6.8% from its 2023 high of $2,385 on Dec. 9. There is solid support at the $2,150 area where it could be heading next as markets continue to cool.\n\nThere is little doubt that the asset will perform well in the next bull cycle, but at the moment, the Ethereum engines are spluttering a little."

But it\u2019s not giving us the big surprise. I think that surprise comes the moment the ETF is out in Bitcoin and people will focus on the ETH ETF.

Or, in fact, just saying SOL has been the best trade in the world bar none. But ETH, it will play catch-up, it will do well.\u201d\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, Pal says that the flagship crypto asset\u2019s price action going forward is likely to mirror its 2015 bull market price action when Bitcoin witnessed a massive burst to the upside without a major correction.\n\n\u201cI think this cycle we\u2019re in now looks more like that 2015, 2016, 2017 than it did 2019-2021.

I think they\u2019re most likely more sideways, give or take a 20% to 30% range, because that\u2019s the world we live in in crypto.\n\nBut we should keep going into the end of 2025 if we\u2019re just repeating the same old cycle, which I think we are.\u201d\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Yakovenko's stance indicates a broader view of what defines a layer-2 solution, challenging traditional boundaries and proposing a more fluid and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolana's market resurgence\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Solana has recently marked a significant achievement by surpassing Ethereum in a key trading metric: perpetual futures trading volume.\n\nSolana's lead in both perpetual futures and spot trading volumes, coupled with a soaring market capitalization, positions it as a formidable competitor in the crypto space, even challenging Ethereum's dominance in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.\n\nThe interest in the Solana ecosystem mostly stems from the meme coin frenzy that was fueled by the rise of the Bonk (BONK) token."

This brings to mind previous reports where Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he envisions a future where SOL and Ether co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto hack: Ethereum, Solana DeFi trading platform Thunder exploited for $239,000\n\nEther displays upside potential as Solana price shows weakness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has spent the better part of December consolidating between the critical support at $ 2,147 and the $2,380 resistance level. Based on technicals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the largest cryptocurrency may be poised to shine, at least for the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL market is exhibiting weakness, as the technical indicators hint at a possible dip in the Solana price. It comes after a prolonged period of SOL being massively overbought, indicated by the presence of the RSI above the 70 level since October 18, when the markets turned bullish. This preceded a correction.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEthereum price outlook with ETH shining at Solana\u2019s expense\n\nAfter Solana price\u2019s epic surge across the fourth quarter, the SOL market is taking a breather, with capital flowing into Ether. With this, Ethereum price looks ready to shine at the expense of Solana.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, suggesting rising momentum. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) indicator remains in the positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis. Increased buying pressure above current levels, therefore, could see Ethereum price rise, potentially flipping the $2,380 resistance level to a support before testing the $2,403 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ethereum price to tag the forecasted $2,500 psychological level, in a move that would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $2,380 roadblock holds as resistance, the ensuing rejection could see Ethereum price lose the critical support at $2,147, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated. In the dire case, Ether market value could descend to test the supply barrier that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,049 and $2,107.\n\nA break and close below the midline at $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with Ethereum price likely to spiral towards the $2,049 support, levels last tested in November."

        "content": "The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism at the core of Ethereum, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, may face systemic complexity. To address this, he has three solutions.\n\n\u201cA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe primary problem is that to keep the network functioning properly, validators that maintain it must create a large number of digital signatures using encryption.\n\nThe network already has a lot of work to handle from this, but as additional validators join, the number of signatures will rise, adding to the system\u2019s workload. Subsequent updates are expected to raise the required signatures even more dramatically.\n\nOn December 27, Buterin wrote a post to the Ethereum Research forum outlining three approaches to avoid this. The shared goal is to reduce the number of signatures needed for each Ethereum blockchain space to 8,192.\n\nThe first solution is centered on decentralized staking pools. This would need raising the minimum amount of ether needed to run a validator to force people running validators to collaborate and pool their resources.\n\nVitalik\u2019s second solution is to have two layers of stakeholders, one with stricter criteria and the other with more lax ones would be the second strategy. During the block finalization process, the two levels would be used in distinct ways.\n\nThe third option would be to have a rotating group of participants, in which case a different group of validators is chosen at random for each slot. Although Buterin pointed out that it would increase complexity, this would divide out the workload and lower the overall number of signatures."

        "title": "SEC Delays Ethereum ETF Decision To May 2024: Bitcoin ETFs Anticipated In January - TronWeekly",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to postpone its decision on several Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until May 2024. This move follows the agency\u2019s decision to delay the consideration of the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.\n\nSEC\u2019s Ethereum ETF Postponement\n\nThe Hashdex Ether ETF is designed to encompass both spot Ether and futures contracts in its portfolio. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF is being regarded as a strategic move, often described as a \u201ctrojan horse,\u201d aimed at pressuring the SEC into approving Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its Ethereum Trust to a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart expressed his views on the matter in a tweet on November 15, stating that if the SEC were to approve Grayscale\u2019s ETH futures ETF application, it could pave the way for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application. Conversely, a denial could lead to Grayscale arguing that the SEC is treating Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs differently under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nWatch [the SEC] try to either approve and argue why this is different from spot. Or Deny and argue why 1933 act products are meaningfully different from 1940 act products. Both are bad for SEC [in my opinion]. Genius move.\n\nAccording to the filing, the SEC has initiated proceedings to gather additional public input on whether these ETFs should be listed, further contributing to the delay. Additionally, the decision on the VanEck spot Ethereum ETF and the spot Ethereum ETF proposed by Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and 21Shares has also been postponed.\n\nBitcoin ETFs: January 2024 Anticipation\n\nDespite these delays and uncertainties surrounding Ethereum ETFs, analysts are still optimistic about the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs by early 2024. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas anticipate that the SEC will greenlight a spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024.\n\nThis positive outlook persists despite last-minute amendments being hastily added by applicants to their proposals. Seyffart pointed out that BlackRock\u2019s recent spot Bitcoin ETF update, accepting the SEC\u2019s cash redemption system, signifies a trend among applicants adopting a cash-only model.\n\nWill be interesting to see who updates their documents after this. SEC might not be comfortable with a Prime Execution Agent (a 3rd party buying and selling bitcoin on behalf of the ETF) purchasing the #Bitcoin in the cash model . This is how BlackRock's is planned at moment: https://t.co/pGWUNp7Lw3 pic.twitter.com/2D60KX7OUI \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 21, 2023\n\nNotable entities like ARK, Bitwise, and Valkyrie have already embraced this approach, while others like Grayscale and WisdomTree continue to include in-kind or cash options in their filings.\n\nIn December, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson predicted a broader industry shift towards the adoption of a cash creation and redemption model for ETFs, emphasizing the changing landscape and regulatory preferences within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin\u2019s Future Threats: Bitmex Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Issues Warning"

        "content": "An Ethereum wallet thought to belong to former U.S. President Donald Trump recently moved millions in crypto earned from sales of non-fungible tokens, according to reports from Arkham Intelligence on Dec. 27.\n\nArkham noted that Trump\u2019s wallet began to send his ETH holdings to Coinbase three weeks ago and has moved 1,075 ETH, worth $2.4 million, to the exchange. Arkham added that Trump\u2019s wallet previously held $4 million at its peak.\n\nLive Arkham data shows that Trump currently holds $1.39 million of ETH. He additionally holds $644,000 in MATIC and small amounts of other cryptocurrency tokens for a total of $2.22 million. Arkham\u2019s data additionally indicates that the wallet did not initiate any transfers to exchanges before December.\n\nThough Arkham suggested that Trump is selling the recently transferred holdings, the attached transaction log only shows deposits to Coinbase. The log does not explicitly show that he has sold or converted the funds to another asset.\n\nFunds likely linked to NFT sales\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is believed to belong to Trump based on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s findings. Arkham asserted in August that the wallet belonged to Trump based on information in a financial statement released that month.\n\nForbes India separately reported on Trump\u2019s financial disclosure at the time. The wallet\u2019s balance appears to originate at least in part from Trump\u2019s NFT sales.\n\nSales of the Trump-themed NFTs are conducted through a firm called NFT International LLC. The company claims it does not operate under Trump. However, Trump has been highly involved in promoting the NFTs and has hosted various events for those who purchase the collectibles. He has seemingly collected royalties and revenue from the sales, as explained above.\n\nThe company has so far released three series of NFTs. The latest batch of NFTs attempted to capitalize on Trump\u2019s recent arrest by featuring his mugshot photo. High-quantity purchases included a physical card with pieces of Trump\u2019s suit.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a sudden market shake-up, over $170 million worth of Solan, Bitcoin and Ethereum were liquidated, as depicted by the latest crypto liquidation data. This flash-crash event has rattled the crypto sphere, occurring just a week before the New Year \u2014 a time when such volatility is not typically unexpected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe end-of-year period often sees a shift in market behavior. Retail investors are known to cash out for the holidays, and larger investors close their positions to avoid unpredictable swings during times of reduced liquidity. The liquidation data reflects this trend, showing a substantial number of positions being wiped out in the face of rapid price movements.\n\nOrder books tend to thin out during the holiday season, with reduced trading volumes and some market makers stepping back, increasing the potential for volatility spikes. This environment can lead to quick and severe market movements, as currently evidenced on the crypto market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the overall market still exhibits signs of an uptrend. The $170 million in liquidations, while significant, is not indicative of a market downturn but rather a typical response to the year-end climate. It is a pattern familiar to seasoned crypto enthusiasts, where the combination of profit-taking and risk aversion can momentarily disrupt the market.\n\nHistorically, as the New Year begins and normal trading volumes resume, the market stabilizes. The situation usually improves by mid-January, once institutional and individual investors return to their desks to reengage with the market.\n\nLooking at the broader picture, the uptrend trajectory remains intact. The recent liquidations, although impactful, are unlikely to derail the general market direction. The crypto ecosystem is known for its resilience, and the current liquidation wave is just another test of this attribute."

        "content": "A trader who accurately called the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2018 bear market thinks that the uptrend of one Ethereum (ETH) challenger that has massively outperformed the broader crypto markets this year is far from over.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 233,400 followers on the social media platform X that the people who are calling for the end of Solana\u2019s (SOL) big rally this year will most likely miss out on the altcoin\u2019s surge to a fresh all-time high (ATH).\n\nAccording to Bluntz, Solana has a lot more gas left in the tank as he predicts that SOL could still print gains of more than 257% from current levels.\n\n\u201cSOL is still 113% away from ATH. Why is everyone so hell-bent on calling tops? What the f**k is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nJust buy dips all the way to $400.\n\nNot a single person is ever going to remember the guy who may or may not have been successful in shorting a 10% move down, but they will remember the chads who long all the way to inevitable all-time highs.\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it, SOL is this cycle\u2019s darling chain, embrace it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $112, up more than 1,000% from this year\u2019s opening price of $9.99.\n\nLooking at the low time frame charts of Solana, the trader thinks that the altcoin is poised for another leg up against both the US dollar and Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go in my opinion on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nBluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis in an attempt to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave uptrend to be followed by an ABC correction before the next leg up.\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s SOL/USD pair, he seems to suggest that the pair is in a position to rally once more after completing an ABC correction. For the SOL/BTC pair, he appears to predict that it could rise above 0.0034 BTC, worth $144.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Wed 27 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of SOL, highlights a new era of collaboration between Solana and Ethereum. According to him, Solana is Ethereum. This intriguing vision paves the way for crypto interoperability.\n\nSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 26, 2023 Anatoly Yakovenko is convinced: Solana is Ethereum\n\n\u201cSolana is Ethereum\u201d: What Does the Founder of the SOL Blockchain Mean?\n\nCrypto analysts have always considered Solana as the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d. But recent statements by Yakovenko are changing the narrative.\n\nIn a recent post on his X account, Yakovenko is expanding the horizon of the crypto blockchain by suggesting that Solana can be more than a mere competitor to Ethereum. Specifically, the co-founder of the SOL crypto platform explores the notion of Solana as a layer 2 for Ethereum.\n\nIn his comments on platform X, Yakovenko explains that this symbiosis is possible through the \u201cnative wormhole layer.\u201d Danksharding, Ethereum\u2019s scalability upgrade, then becomes the key to this collaboration. It will improve scalability, thereby paving the way for unexpected cooperation between two crypto blockchain giants.\n\nDanksharding: The Path to Crypto Interoperability\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, Danksharding appears to be the key that unlocks the potential for interoperability between the two crypto platforms. He maintains that the extension of danksharding will facilitate the integration of SOL blocks within a validation relay contract on the Ethereum crypto blockchain. This underscores a collaborative approach to bridging protocol and consensus differences.\n\nThe different consensus mechanisms between Solana and Ethereum raise questions about the stability of this crypto alliance. Some users wonder about the possible reorganization of Solana as a layer 2 if Ethereum adopts a different approach. In this regard, Yakovenko assures that users can withdraw their crypto ETH tokens from the bridge. The agreement from both sides remains essential, however.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that mutual agreement is necessary for seamless integration. He thus highlights the challenges that remain despite the innovative vision of crypto interoperability between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s bold statement marks a turning point in Solana\u2019s perception towards Ethereum. This exploration of crypto interoperability, fueled by Danksharding, promises a collaborative future in the complex universe of blockchain.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent development that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has raised eyebrows with a significant withdrawal of $13.8 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) from Binance. The transaction was highlighted by PeckShieldAlert, a prominent blockchain security company, in a tweet that raised suspicions surrounding the withdrawal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tweet mentioned that the address 0x9FCc...19Fe had initiated a withdrawal of 6,166 ETH (equivalent to approximately $13.8 million) from Binance. The mention of \"Suspicious Justin Sun related\" has triggered concerns and speculation within the crypto space, leading many to question the motives behind such a substantial withdrawal.\n\nAs of the latest data , the current price of Ethereum stands at $2,239, reflecting a 1.55% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a more significant surge of 7.22% over the past 30 days. Interestingly, despite recent market fluctuations, Ethereum's trading volume has surged by over 14.89% in the last 24 hours, reaching a total of $9,184,315,852.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin Sun's cryptic moves\n\nThis development comes on the heels of Justin Sun's earlier notable withdrawals, where he pulled out massive amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens from Binance. The first withdrawal involved a staggering 500 billion SHIB tokens, followed by another withdrawal of approximately 77 billion SHIB tokens. These transactions had already raised eyebrows within the crypto community, prompting discussions about Sun's strategic moves on the market.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, on May 11, Justin Sun announced his decision to actively engage in trading meme coins and promising projects through his public address. The declaration indicated a shift in Sun's investment strategy, opting for more speculative and meme-driven digital assets.\n\nThe latest Ethereum withdrawal only adds to the growing concerns and speculations surrounding Justin Sun's cryptocurrency activities. The crypto community is now closely monitoring further statements or actions from Sun that may shed light on his motives and intentions behind these significant transactions."

        "content": "Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has managed to sustain above the $2150 level. This level coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall trend of this asset remains bullish. With an intraday gain of 5.3%, the ETH price has just offered a breakout above the resistance trendline which traced the correction trend indicating an early signal of uptrend continuation.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Ain\u2019t Dead: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Can Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2500\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the overhead trendline should release the build-up momentum\n\nThe coin buyers may face potential supply pressure at $2400, followed by $2665\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.8 Billion, indicating a 30% gain.\n\nAfter witnessing steady growth from mid-October to early December, the Ethereum price shifted its projection sideways in line with the current market uncertainty. This last three weeks\u2019 consolidation gives a view of price sustainability at higher levels and a short breather per buyers to recuperate the rest of the time.\n\nInterestingly, the ETH price was actively rebounding from two converging trendlines which acted as a dynamic resistance and support. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow, which led to a decisive breakout from the upper trendline in the 4-hour time frame chart.\n\nShould this candle close above the breached level, the buyers would obtain an early signal of uptrend continuation. With sustained buying the ETH price should surpass the last swing high resistance of $2400 to obtain a better confirmation and entry opportunity.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci extension tool, the post-correction rally can chase a potential target of $2665 aligned with the 0.618 FIB level\n\nKey Level to Watch\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum seems strongly bullish, the coin buyers may face renewed supply pressure at the $2400 mark. In case this resistance triggers another correction, the coin holders can rely on an ascending trendline that has been offering dynamic support to the ETH price for nearly two months. The coin price rebounded several times from the support project the buyers continued to accumulate at market dips, which is a strong signal of an established uptrend. On the contrary, a breakdown below this support would trigger a significant correction in ETH price\n\nBollinger Band: The flattish upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator offers an additional layer of resistance at $2400\n\nVortex Indicator: A bullish crossover between the VI+ and VI- slope signals a recovery trend in active.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "The best crypto books of 2023 - Fortune",
        "content": "In 2015, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper published Digital Gold, an early account of Bitcoin that holds up as one of the best books on crypto. Since then, there have been a flood of other titles as publishers rushed to cash in on a subject defined by easy riches, outrageous characters, and a mind-boggling array of scams.\n\nThis past year brought a new glut of books. Unlike the ones published during crypto boom years, which pulse with a mix of greed and adulation, most of the 2023 titles came wrapped in a thick sheen of scorn\u2014and understandably so given the spectacular frauds, epitomized by Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX, that defined the industry\u2019s most recent bust.\n\nHere are Fortune Crypto\u2019s picks for the three best crypto titles of the year: two of them monuments to crimes, and one a reminder that the broader blockchain industry is not only alive and well but becoming part of the mainstream financial system.\n\nGoing Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon\n\nBy Michael Lewis\n\nStar business writer Michael Lewis\u2014whose bestsellers include Moneyball and The Big Short\u2014enjoyed an unprecedented level of access to boy king Sam Bankman-Fried right up until his $32 billion empire unraveled in the space of a week.\n\nThe published version of Going Infinite is not what Lewis had intended to write, and, indeed, the first version of his manuscript cast Bankman-Fried as a sympathetic figure poised to change the world through the nebulous philosophy of effective altruism. The final text reflects how Lewis had to adapt his story upon learning that the young mogul\u2019s tale was all a web of lies.\n\nThis abrupt pivot results in the last chapters of the book becoming an intellectual scramble as the author can\u2019t quite forsake his onetime protagonist. But that doesn\u2019t matter much given the incredible amount of mind-blowing detail Lewis is able to reveal about Bankman-Fried, his family, and the bizarre, hypocritical lifestyle he forged while walking the highest corridors of power in Washington, D.C., and raising money from everyone from Tom Brady to Sequoia Capital. Going Infinite will join Digital Gold as one of the all-time best crypto books.\n\nNumber Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall\n\nBy Zeke Faux\n\nAs the title suggests, there is nothing subtle about this book. Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux takes the reader on an up-close tour of the very worst people in crypto\u2014from the grifter/rapper wannabe Razzlekhan to the Bond-like villains slinging billions of dollars of digital assets in murky cross-border business dealings.\n\nNumber Go Up is often uproariously funny, most notably when Faux risks his kids\u2019 college savings to temporarily purchase a Bored Ape NFT in order to attend a cringe-inducing party of crypto geeks. But the book is also a sober look at the darker side of crypto. In particular, Faux shows how the unregulated stablecoin Tether has helped to power a sinister industry called pig-butchering that relies on slave labor to text lonely people and dupe them into sending money to offshore criminal gangs. While the people behind Tether are unquestionably shady, Faux\u2019s drive to expose them sometimes takes on a monomaniacal quality, and his campaign to show the entirety of crypto is a scam feels more like advocacy than reporting. Still, this is a relatively minor quibble with an otherwise excellent book.\n\nEthereum for Business: A Plain-English Guide\n\nBy Paul Brody\n\nEven as scams and scandals dominated news coverage of crypto for most of 2023, the industry continued to plod forward and\u2014to the likely disappointment of its many haters\u2014even flourish. This book by Paul Brody, Ernst & Young\u2019s global blockchain leader, explains why that\u2019s the case.\n\nEthereum for Business shows how a growing number of real-world enterprises\u2014from banks to shipping agencies\u2014are using the power of distributed-ledger technology to improve security and efficiency in everything from payments to supply chains.\n\nThe book is not a narrative yarn like the others on this list, but is instead a practical overview of an emerging field in crypto and business, focusing on Ethereum\u2014the second-most-valuable blockchain and one that popularized the use of autonomous smart contracts. It will be helpful reading for anyone interested in how technology is changing business and benefits from Brody\u2019s clear, straightforward writing style."

        "content": "Manta Pacific's TVL spiked 1,250% in December.\n\nIt is now the seventh biggest layer 2 blockchain network on Ethereum.\n\nOther layer 2s are also ratcheting up airdrops.\n\nCrypto airdrop hunters have deposited $345 million into Manta Pacific, Manta Network\u2019s Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, since December 14.\n\nWhy the sudden interest?\n\nBecause of an airdrop expected in early 2024.\n\nAirdrop hunters have deposited Ether and stablecoins into the blockchain to obtain rewards scheduled for distribution in January.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s TVL has skyrocketed 1,250% in December. This spike has made Manta Pacific the seventh largest Ethereum layer 2 blockchain per total value locked, according to data from Ethereum layer 2 tracking portal L2Beat.\n\nTVL is a metric that tracks how much crypto is locked up in a DeFi protocol\u2019s smart contracts, or in all DeFi protocols running on a given blockchain.\n\nPromising signs\n\nFor Kenny Li, co-founder of blockchain developer p0x Labs and Manta Network contributor, the TVL growth is encouraging.\n\n\u201cThese early promising signs mean that a new contender is emerging from DeFi to challenge the likes of zkSync and Base,\u201d Li told DL News.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBase and zkSync are also Ethereum layer 2 blockchains.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThe smart contract that holds these deposits is not verified on Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, so it\u2019s difficult for independent security experts to determine its safety.\n\nManta\u2019s team says the contract has been reviewed by security experts.\n\n\u201cThe contracts have been audited by Veridise,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the audit is unverified on Etherscan as the contract is not open-sourced but we plan on having these verified in the future.\u201d\n\nFor risk-tolerant crypto degens, the unverified contract has not proved to be an issue as they\u2019ve run up nine-figure dollar deposits.\n\nInvestors were driven to deposit these funds as part of Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign.\n\nIt promises five layers of rewards for early investors, including an airdrop of 50 million Manta tokens. Manta isn\u2019t trading yet, so those 50 million tokens do not yet have market value.\n\nGetting a STONE token\n\nThis TVL growth is most likely driven by the promised airdrop because the project\u2019s canonical bridge has attracted only $28 million in deposits since its creation three months ago.\n\nManta airdrop hopefuls receive a token called STONE in exchange for their locked Ether deposits in the blockchain.\n\nSTONE is a so-called yield-bearing token, according to Manta\u2019s documentation. Airdrop hunters will be able to redeem STONE for Manta tokens in January.\n\nAs a yield-bearing token, airdrop hunters can use STONE to earn points on protocols within Manta Pacific that support the token. By doing so, investors can farm more STONE tokens and potentially increase their promised Manta token airdrop.\n\nDepositors also earn NFTs, which can be sold on Element, a multichain NFT marketplace.\n\nParticipants are also hunting for NFT combinations that will yield even bigger airdrop rewards, a process that requires them to acquire six different NFTs from the campaign that can be combined to get a premium NFT that offers greater rewards.\n\n$1 billion in investments\n\nManta is only the latest in a growing trend of projects enticing significant early backing with the promise of rewards early next year.\n\nBlast, a planned Ethereum layer 2 blockchain project, managed to attract about $650 million in barely a week after it was announced in November. The project now sits on top of over $1 billion in investments.\n\nLike Blast, Manta Pacific is also invite-only with prospective new entrants requiring invite codes from existing investors.\n\nManta Network did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Manta Network core contributor Kenny Li.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Three new token projects ride $1bn EigenLayer hype - DLNews",
        "content": "Three liquid restaking projects have launched new tokens in the past two weeks.\n\nTheir debuts come amid a surge of interest in EigenLayer, the first staking protocol on Ethereum.\n\nProponents say they could kick off a new bull market or lead to the next high-profile crash.\n\nLiquid restaking tokens that will allow crypto investors to leverage Ether for greater yields are riding excitement sparked by EigenLayer, a six-month-old protocol that surged to more than $1 billion in user deposits last week.\n\nTheir rise could kick off another speculative frenzy, or another Terra-style crash, according to people in the industry who spoke to DL News.\n\nThree tokens have launched in the past two weeks, and one company announced a fundraise led by prominent crypto-focused venture capital firms.\n\nThis flurry of news comes amid EigenLayer\u2019s decision to raise its cap on user deposits. That\u2019s because the current crop of liquid restaking providers all intend to build on top of EigenLayer, the first protocol to enable restaking on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe protocols are taking the first steps into this new staking realm,\u201d Pedro Verdades, co-founder of liquid restaking provider InceptionLRT, told DL News. \u201cWe will see more and more of this over the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Kelp DAO launched a liquid restaking token, rsETH. As of Tuesday, users had deposited more than $125 million worth of crypto, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nKelp DAO deposits topped $100 million a week after its launch.\n\nOn December 18, liquid restaking provider Renzo launched its own liquid restaking token, ezETH, and Rio, a competitor, announced a seed round led by venture capital firms Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital, and Breyer Capital. Rio did not disclose the amount of the round.\n\nOn December 20, users began claiming a governance token, RSTK, from Restake Finance, another liquid restaking provider.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThose three join Ether.Fi, which launched its restaking token, eETH, in November.\n\nSince an upgrade in 2022, Ethereum relies on a process called staking to verify and order transactions. To stake, users must lock up their Ether in exchange for an annual yield. Liquid staking providers such as Lido address the opportunity cost of locking up Ether by providing receipt tokens \u2014 staked Ether \u2014 that can be used in lieu of Ether across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nBiggest business in DeFi\n\nLiquid staking is now the biggest business in DeFi, with more than $32 billion in user deposits, according to Defi Llama.\n\nRestaking allows users to stake their staked Ether \u2014 not to secure Ethereum, but to secure protocols that would otherwise have to run on their own networks, such as the bridges that allow users to transfer tokens between otherwise incompatible blockchains.\n\nIn exchange for staked Ether, protocols using EigenLayer pay restakers, boosting the relatively risk-free yields they can earn from old-fashioned staking.\n\nLike liquid staking providers, liquid restaking providers address the opportunity cost of locking up staked Ether by providing receipt tokens.\n\nProponents say this will dramatically reduce the cost of certain protocols, such as bridges, other blockchains, oracles, and other technology critical to the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis is the most groundbreaking evolution since Ethereum,\u201d Verdades said. \u201cIn a few years, this will be a $20 billion to $25 billion industry and we\u2019re [frontrunning] it!\u201d\n\nRisks\n\nStill, others say it\u2019s a business model that could cause systemic risk if providers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nThat\u2019s because liquid restaking is a leveraged play that allows users to effectively place bets on the various protocols that use EigenLayer, some of which may be poorly run.\n\nAs the market matures, observers predict liquid restaking tokens will integrate with the broader DeFi ecosystem and be used as collateral to borrow other crypto, mint stablecoins, and more.\n\nThose layers of leverage are potential points of failure, according to Lucas Kozinski, a founding contributor to Renzo. Liquid restaking providers will have to carefully manage which EigenLayer-based businesses they support and the yields they promise users.\n\n\u201cYou have to think about risk management, similar to collateral assets on a lending protocol,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\nGabe Tramble, co-founder of crypto research firm Shoal Research, agrees.\n\nIn a report on liquid restaking published this week, Tramble and a co-author detail some of the issues of the emerging sector.\n\n\u201cI do see significant risk though of rehypothecation,\u201d he told DL News, referring to the practice in which a financial institution users customer collateral for its own purposes. \u201c[It\u2019s] something to keep an eye on.\u201d"

        "title": "Crypto Price Prediction For December 26th: ETH, HNT, ROSE - CoinGape",
        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: On Tuesday, the crypto market witnessed a sudden selling pressure prolonging a correction trend in several altcoins. Despite this pullback, the overall market dynamic remains in buyers\u2019 favor, providing a new entry opportunity in coins like Ethereum(ETH), Oasis network(ROSE), and Helium(HNT).\n\nCurrently, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $1.66 trillion, marking a slight decline of 0.31% since yesterday. In contrast, the total trading volume in the crypto sphere has witnessed a substantial increase of 23.61% in the last 24 hours, totaling $74.32 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Analysts Predict BTC Rally To Continue As Bitcoin Funding Rates Reset\n\nEthereum(ETH) Price Takes A Strategic Pause Before Next Leap\n\nIn December, the Ethereum(ETH) coin predominantly fluctuated within a defined range, oscillating between $2400 and $2133. While this lateral movement in the daily chart signifies market indecision, it came after an 8-week rally indicating the buyers are taking a breather.\n\nThis pause in momentum, hovering above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, suggests a healthy market correction, potentially setting the stage for a renewed upward trajectory. Notably, Intotheblock, a prominent on-chain data provider, highlighted that Ethereum\u2019s long-term holder base expanded significantly, exceeding 70% in December.\n\nThis shift underscores a strengthening investor confidence and long-term commitment to Ethereum. Currently, the ETH price is trading at $2141, experiencing a minor intraday setback of 1.34%.\n\nThe Ethereum price is primed for a potential breakout above the $2400 resistance, which could pave the way for reaching higher targets at $2675 and $2957.\n\nHelium(HNT) Price Offers Pullback Opportunity\n\nHelium (HNT) coin demonstrated remarkable performance in the first three weeks of December, surging 236% from a monthly low of $2.7 to a high of $9.65. Despite the overall market uncertainty, HNT experienced a 23.57% retracement, now trading around $7.31.\n\nAccording to Fibonacci retracement analysis, if the Helium price sustains above either the 38.2% or 50% levels, which correspond to $6.55 and $5.5 respectively, it maintains its bullish stance. A rebound from these levels would suggest a replenishment of bullish momentum, potentially leading to the HNT price surpassing the $10 mark.\n\nMoreover, the midline of the Bollinger Bands provides additional support, reinforcing the likelihood of a recovery\n\nOasis Network(ROSE) Price Gives Key Resistance Breakout to Chase $0.167\n\nIn line with general bullish sentiment and the formation of a bullish reversal pattern, the ROSE token price has shown an aggressive rally initiated from the 4th week of October. In the last 10 weeks, the coin price has surged from $0.0396 to the current trading price of $0.14, registering a remarkable 264% growth.\n\nIn light of an increasing volume, the ROSE price has breached some crucial resistance like $0.085, $0.116, and most recently $0.137. If the Coin buyers managed to close today\u2019s daily candle above this breached resistance, the buyers would obtain another stepping stone for higher levels.\n\nThe post-breakout rally will surge the price another 15% to hit the next resistance level at $0.167.\n\nThe Momentum Indicator RSI at 80% reflects a strong bullish momentum and a slight hint of overbought assets.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s cutting-edge smart contract framework unveiled - CryptoNewsZ",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have made their presence almost worldwide, prompting investors and traders worldwide to invest in them and gain substantial ROI. However, it is crucial to note that these fascinating cryptocurrencies are highly risky due to unprecedented price volatility, causing investors to incur many losses. Ethereum, a prominent cryptocurrency and decentralized blockchain, continues gaining traction and prominence in the sector despite the various potential challenges.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Ethereum is recognized as a cutting-edge smart contract, the up-to-date innovation on which our article is based, and resonates with all Ethereum investors and fanatics. Apart from delving into this innovation, it is crucial to understand existing security issues on the Ethereum network. So, let\u2019s comprehensively unravel Ethereum\u2019s innovations and security issues below.\n\nSecurity Challenges on Ethereum\n\nBeosin\u2019s discoveries, such as the substantial losses in quarter three. Blockchain security firm Beosin\u2019s recent findings, outlined in the \u201cGlobal Web3 Security Report,\u201d highlight the precarious state of security on the Ethereum network. These revelations shed light on the prevalent vulnerabilities affecting the blockchain.\n\nKey statistics on losses due to rug pulls and phishing schemes. Beosin\u2019s report exposes the financial toll inflicted on crypto investors during quarter three, with a staggering $282.96 million lost to rug pulls. This alarming figure emphasizes the urgent need for heightened security measures within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nPointing out Ethereum\u2019s susceptibility to security incidents. Quarter three also witnessed the proliferation of phishing schemes, resulting in losses amounting to $66.15 million. Ethereum\u2019s susceptibility to such schemes highlights the growing menace of fraudulent activities plaguing the network.\n\nBeosin\u2019s comprehensive report concludes that Ethereum faced the highest losses and incidents overall. This designation accentuates the critical need for proactive security measures to safeguard users against the persistent security threats looming over the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIssues with the Solidity Compiler\n\nChaals Nevile, who is a technical program director at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), has reportedly highlighted specific issues about the Ethereum network\u2019s security, specifically in the Solidity compiler. Simply put, according to Nevile, the emergence of new bugs while dealing with old bugs as the compiler evolves is a critical issue.\n\nThe European Economic Area, or the EEA, set up the \u201cEth Trust Security Levels Working Group\u2019 in November 2020 in light of the issues to be addressed. This group played a pivotal role in releasing the \u201cEthTrust Security Levels Specification v1\u201d in August 2022, offering a comprehensive framework for developers and organizations navigating the intricacies of Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s primary programming language.\n\nEthTrust Security Levels Specification v1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelease of the v1 Specification: The EEA released the EthTrust Security Levels v1 Specification in November 2020. This release did not take time to resonate with developers, organizations, and customers due to the structured framework it provided. It paved the way for them to deal with the challenges using Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s key programming language.\n\nFramework purpose: How it serves as a framework for reviewing smart contracts. The v1 Specification serves as a key framework for users evaluating smart contract programmed code set down in Solidity. Simply put, the framework helps users evaluate the code prudently and utilize smart contracts more effectively.\n\nOngoing security focus: Recognition that the framework is designed to accommodate ongoing security developments. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the Ethereum network, Chaals Nevile emphasizes the adaptability of the EthTrust Security Levels Specification. While v1 covers bugs up to 2022, it remains designed to accommodate ongoing and emerging security developments, reflecting the commitment to maintaining the highest security standards.\n\nRelease of EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2\n\nAs reported by Nevile, the EEA, which is not fully satisfied with the release and effectiveness of Eth Trust Security Levels Specification v1, announced the release of v2 for enhanced performance. Hopefully, EthTrust Security Levels Specification v2 works like a charm to get on top of various issues, for example, addressing newly detected bugs in the Solidity compiler, ironing out rounding errors, read-only reentrancy attacks, etc.\n\nCase Study: The DAO Hack\n\nThe DAO Hack of 2016 is recognized as a notable event in Ethereum\u2019s history, catalyzed by the notorious reentrancy vulnerability. This classic case, outlined by Lewellen, highlighted the exploitable nature of reentrancy, resulting in a staggering loss of $3.64 million in ETH. The incident spurred heightened awareness and a paradigm shift in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s security approach.\n\nIndustry Adoption of EthTrust Standards\n\nOpenZeppelin\u2019s use: How OpenZeppelin utilizes EthTrust Security Levels v1 for pre-audit assessments. OpenZeppelin, aware of the critical importance of security, actively employs the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework to fortify its defenses against vulnerabilities. Acting as a pre-audit assessment tool, this framework ensures meticulous checks during the audit process, offering clients invaluable insights into potential security lapses.\n\nClient feedback: Positive feedback from a client who found value in implementing EthTrust requirements. An anonymous OpenZeppelin client disclosed to Crypto News the transformative impact of EthTrust. The client shared how previous security audits faltered due to unclear guidance, emphasizing newfound confidence after implementing EthTrust requirements. This endorsement underscores EthTrust\u2019s efficacy in fortifying Ethereum projects.\n\nAwareness challenges: Chaals Nevile acknowledges the uphill battle of gaining recognition for the EthTrust standard despite positive feedback. Overcoming these challenges is crucial, especially in introducing the framework to developers and organizations. Notably, EthTrust\u2019s applicability to newer Ethereum projects emphasizes its potential impact in enhancing security protocols, particularly in the context of Ethereum casino sites. Raising awareness about the EthTrust standard becomes imperative for its broader adoption and ensuring a secure environment, especially within the dynamic sphere of Ethereum casino gambling.\n\nConcerns and Future Developments\n\nJohn Wingate\u2019s concerns about the dynamic nature of industry standards. John Wingate, CEO of BankSocial, expresses concerns about the ever-evolving landscape of industry standards. He highlights the perpetual changes in languages, including the depreciation of methods, variables, data types, and object types. The dynamic nature challenges consistency and adherence to the best practices within the blockchain space.\n\nConfirmation that version 3 is already in progress. In response to industry dynamics, Chaals Nevile reveals that EthTrust is actively evolving, with version 3 of the specification already underway. Recognizing the need for regular updates, Nevile aims to ensure EthTrust remains relevant and effective in addressing emerging security challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportance of testing: Emphasizing the need for repeatable, automated testing for decentralized applications. John Wingate emphasizes the significance of repeatable, automated testing as the paramount method to guarantee decentralized applications adhere to best practices. Automated testing is a crucial tool in fortifying the resilience of decentralized systems against potential security exploits.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering the complexity of Ethereum\u2019s security, the discourse around EthTrust emerges as a beacon for fortification. From exposing vulnerabilities like reentrancy to deploying the EthTrust Security Levels v1 framework, the Ethereum community is actively fortifying its defenses. While positive feedback underscores EthTrust\u2019s efficacy, challenges in industry adoption persist. Chaals Nevile\u2019s assurance of version 3\u2019s progress signals a commitment to staying ahead in the security paradigm. John Wingate\u2019s advocacy for automated testing reinforces the imperative of proactive measures. As Ethereum evolves, the collaborative efforts of industry players and evolving standards promise a resilient and secure future for decentralized applications."

Less than 1% of wallets on our platform were affected as a result of this attack.\n\nFurthermore, the team stated that they are already communicating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and are willing to negotiate with the exploiter, failure of which would lead to them taking legal action.\n\nWe have taken the following actions:\n\n- Our legal team and the FBI have been contacted.\n\n- We are now undergoing a full, technical audit.\n\n- We are working on adding 2FA immediately for withdrawals.\n\n- We are adding additional security regarding session issuing.\n\n- We know which\u2026 \u2014 Thunder (@ThunderTerminal) December 27, 2023\n\nLastly, users were reassured of the safety of their assets, and the ones affected were notified with the team claiming that the lost funds would be refunded in full and the users would be given 0% fees and $100,000 in credits.\n\nThe Thunder exploit could be the last exploit of 2023, which has already seen the theft of more than $2 billion worth of assets, with the largest attack witnessed by blockchain security consultancy firm Mixin Network, resulting in the loss of over $200 million worth of digital assets."

        "content": "This week, something interesting happened in the world of cryptocurrency. Justin Sun, the person who started Tron, took out a huge amount of Ethereum (ETH), about $13.8 million, from Binance, a major crypto exchange.\n\nA company that keeps tabs of blockchain transactions, PeckShieldAlert, said it looked suspicious and linked to Sun. This got a lot of people in the crypto community talking and wondering what was going on.\n\nJustin Sun Pullout Causes ETH To Drop\n\nWhat made it more puzzling was that right when Sun took out the money, the price of Ethereum went down a bit. But, surprisingly, more people started trading Ethereum, and the trading volume increased by over 15%.\n\nThis made everyone even more curious, especially because Sun is known for doing bold things in the crypto world.\n\nSo, basically, Sun did something unexpected by taking out a lot of Ethereum, and it got everyone talking and guessing about why he did it. The crypto world can be kind of unpredictable, and this was one of those moments that made people wonder what might happen next.\n\nNo stranger to headlines, Sun has previously withdrawn massive amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens from Binance, raising eyebrows with a staggering 500 billion SHIB move followed by another 77 billion SHIB withdrawal."

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko says 'Solana is Ethereum' in layer-2 scalability debate h3>\n\nSolana creator Anatoly Yakovenko recently referred to Solana as an Ethereum layer-2 solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer in a post on X.\n\nIn the exchange, Yakovenko positioned the blockchain as an Ethereum layer-2 while responding to a tweet listing various other L2 solutions, including Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon, among others. He wrote:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, the integration of Solana with Ethereum is facilitated by the Wormhole eigenlayer, which would eventually allow the potential for Solana blocks to be submitted into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum after key scalability upgrades.\n\nOn the rise\n\nFollowing a challenging start to 2023, Solana ended the year with a significant upturn. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana impressively more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nThe post Anatoly Yakovenko says \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in layer-2 scalability debate appeared first on CryptoSlate.\n\nCheck More Latest Cryptocurrency News Click Here\u2013 Latest Cryptocurrency News\n\nCheck More Business News Click Here\u2013 Latest Business News"
