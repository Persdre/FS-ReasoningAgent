        "content": "Ethereum users say they are spending upwards of $100 on gas fees for swaps and NFTs during peak times. The upcoming Dencun upgrade will lower fees, but there is a caveat.\n\nEthereum users are struggling with high gas fees as usage increases on the network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s renaissance\n\nand a\n\nspectacular rally\n\nin cryptocurrency prices is making life difficult for users of the Ethereum network.\n\nAs user demand and interest in both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) surges\u2014on the back of the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US and the potential approval of spot ether ETFs \u2014 gas prices on Ethereum are spiraling out of control.\n\nAt peak times, users are reporting paying over $100 in transaction fees for swaps, which is the exchange of one crypto token for another on the network. The average gas fee for a swap transaction is currently around $79, according to data from Etherscan.\n\nGas prices for swaps back above $100 lmao \u2014 Pentoshi \ud83d\udc27 euroPeng \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa (@Pentosh1) February 28, 2024\n\nThe \u201ctop gas guzzlers\u201d are decentralized exchange Uniswap and Blast, an Ethereum layer 2 network that launched on mainnet yesterday. Respectively, they\u2019ve earned $2.5 million and $1.4 million in fees within the last 24 hours, per Etherscan data.\n\n400 fucking dollars to migrate .1 ETH to Blast mainnet. It's so over. Pack it up. Ethereum is unusable today. pic.twitter.com/hZRrwRAMlz \u2014 Pop Punk (@PopPunkOnChain) February 29, 2024\n\nThe high transaction fees once again draw attention to Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges and how difficult it can be to onboard new users to the network during times of increased interest.\n\nEthereum is not blind to these issues, which continue to reoccur in bull market cycles. Ethereum has an ambitious multi-year roadmap to reduce transaction fees, increase security, and future proof the network.\n\nRead more: An Overview of Ethereum Scaling\n\n\u201cEthereum is trying to learn from this mistake of pricing away marginal users to other, cheaper chains,\u201d said Luke Nolan, Ethereum research associate at digital asset investment manager CoinShares. \u201cThe proposed and implemented solution is to scale through layer 2 solutions, mostly rollups.\u201d\n\nTwo key upgrades from the roadmap have already been implemented including \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which was Ethereum\u2019s transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and the \u201cShapella\u201d upgrade, which enabled the release of staked ether withdrawals. The next major upgrade is Dencun, which is scheduled for March 13.\n\nRead more: What Is the Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Update on Ethereum?\n\nOne of the key introductions in the Dencun upgrade is a new transaction type called \u201cblobs.\u201d Ethereum layer 2 rollups currently post data to Ethereum using calldata. This is costly and makes up around 90% of the gas fees that rollups pay to post bundled transactions to the network. After Dencun, layer 2s will post the data to blobs, which are highly optimized and are much cheaper than calldata.\n\n\u201cOverall, yes fees will reduce on Ethereum, but only for layer 2s,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThe general hope here is that layer 2s will become sophisticated enough over time, with seamless UX, high speed and low transaction costs \u2026 In this end state, Ethereum can compete with any new fast chain that comes out of the box because layer 1 continues to be the secure settlement layer, and layer 2 becomes the data availability layer that allows it all to scale to new heights.\u201d\n\nUnder the upgrade, transaction fees on layer 2s will decrease between 10 to 100 times depending on the chain, said Nolan, adding that it could get very close to \u201cSolana-esque transaction fees.\u201d\n\nSolana\u2019s Surge\n\nThis fee reduction couldn\u2019t come soon enough for many users. Many Ethereum users, particularly those who trade NFTs, are talking about moving to Solana, which is a layer 1 blockchain that offers much cheaper transaction fees.\n\nIt costs 52 dollars to purchase a standard ERC-721 off Blur right now. It costs another 20-30 dollars per marketplace you want to list that NFT on. and that's with gwei relatively low (70) by bull market standards ETH does not make sense for the majority of NFT collections. \u2014 root (@rootslashbin) February 27, 2024\n\nThe average transaction costs for NFTs on Ethereum is around $140, per Etherscan, which is sometimes more than the cost of the actual NFT being traded. While on Solana, the average cost of a transaction is 0.000036 SOL, which is $0.0047, according to data from Solscan.\n\n\u201cAs of the last few months, a lot of attention has shifted to Solana NFTs, which has certainly taken some of Ethereum\u2019s market share,\u201d said Nolan, adding that Ethereum NFT trading is not back to the same transaction volume levels as last year.\n\nMost activity on Ethereum is centering around collections with high floor prices such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and Moonbirds, Nolan said. They have floor prices of $75,000 and $4,000 respectively. In these scenarios, a trader is unlikely to be phased by a $100 transaction fee.\n\nDaily NFT trade volume on Ethereum in millions (CoinShares)\n\n\u201cWhilst on Solana I would venture to say that the activity for smaller collections (as well as big ones) has been picking up because transaction fees are 100x smaller on average and so the smaller value accounts have logically flocked over there,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cIt has made for a much more enjoyable speculative playground for participants.\u201d\n\nWeekly NFT volume on Solana in millions (CoinShares)\n\nThis is echoed by Anastasia Melachrinos, a DeFi product manager at crypto data firm Kaiko, who notes that new users are generally entering the blockchain ecosystem through centralized exchanges or directly via Solana.\n\n\u201cIt is without a doubt that high throughput upgradeable chains like Aptos or Solana will receive most of the non crypto native traffic, which is most of the world in the case mass adoption does take place,\u201d said Sharvin Baindur, chief of staff at investment firm Saison Capital, who focuses on investing and supporting high performance and low cost blockchains.\n\nEven if gas fees on layer 2s are reduced to Solana levels, Nolan notes that Ethereum layer 2s still face challenges around fragmentation and poor user experiences, which can act as a barrier to capturing those smaller value transactions. On the flip side, Ethereum and layer 2s have a strong reputation and a very complete ecosystem, so once the execution cost is fixed the barriers to entry to those chains will be lowered, Melachrinos said."

        "title": "Ethereum price fluctuations: What drives the changes in market value? - The Times and Democrat",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency world is dynamic and often unpredictable, with values soaring and dipping in what can sometimes seem like a matter of moments. Ethereum (ETH) is a significant player among the various cryptocurrencies. Many people, like investors and traders, watch its price fluctuations closely. So, what exactly drives these changes in ETH price? Here\u2019s a dive into this subject, exploring the factors influencing Ethereum's market value.\n\nMarket Demand and Supply Dynamics\n\nOne of the reasons for the ETH price fluctuations often comes down to the basic economic principle of supply and demand. Ethereum is subject to the same market forces that affect traditional currencies and commodities like other cryptocurrencies. When the demand for Ethereum increases due to its growing utility or positive news about its development, its price may rise. Conversely, if the market falls or there's a surge in supply, the price may drop. This up-and-down price movement is standard in the financial world, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nInfluence of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nEthereum's value also appears to be closely tied to the performance of Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. Often, when Bitcoin's value rises or falls sharply, other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, tend to follow suit. This phenomenon reflects the interconnected nature of the cryptocurrency market, where the trends and events surrounding one major player can have a ripple effect across the board.\n\nTechnological Advances and Network Upgrades\n\nAnother significant factor influencing ETH price fluctuations is the technological development of the Ethereum network. Ethereum has reportedly undergone several upgrades to improve its scalability, security, and efficiency. These upgrades might have a substantial impact on its price. Investors may see technological advancements as a sign of long-term viability, which might increase demand and, subsequently, the price of ETH.\n\nRegulatory News and Economic Events\n\nThe regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies can have a profound effect on their prices. Announcements of stricter regulations, or even the possibility of such rules, could lead to a decrease in the cost of Ethereum. On the other hand, positive regulatory news might boost investor confidence, leading to price increases. Economic events, such as inflation rates or changes in interest rates in major economies, may also influence investor behavior and affect the price of Ethereum.\n\nSpeculation and Investor Sentiment\n\nLastly, speculation plays a considerable role in ETH price fluctuations. The cryptocurrency market is known for its speculative nature, with prices often driven by investor sentiment rather than fundamental value. News, rumors, or social media hype could lead to sudden and sharp price movements. This speculative aspect makes investing in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum both exciting and risky.\n\nMany factors, including market demand and supply, Bitcoin's performance, technological advancements, regulatory news, and investor sentiment, might influence Ethereum's price. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the cryptocurrency market's workings and the forces behind ETH price fluctuations. Whether you're an investor, a trader, or simply someone fascinated by digital currencies, keeping an eye on these dynamics can be enlightening and rewarding.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum and Its Price Impact\n\nPredicting future Ethereum price movements remains complex due to the numerous factors at play. However, looking ahead, several key developments could impact its value.\n\nThe successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0 may hold the promise of faster transaction speeds, reduced fees, and enhanced scalability, potentially drawing in more users and developers and driving demand, thus impacting the price positively. Moreover, the apparent expanding adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum, which is reshaping financial services, could further bolster demand for the platform, influencing its price upwards. Additionally, increasing interest from institutional investors such as hedge funds and banks could inject significant capital into the Ethereum market, potentially increasing the price. Furthermore, regulatory clarity and supportive frameworks may facilitate broader adoption and institutional involvement, potentially elevating Ethereum's long-term value.\n\nThis information is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "content": "The U.S. watchdog SEC received too many \"political blowbacks\" after having Bitcoin spot ETFs approved in the United States, seasoned legal expert says. As such, the most anticipated event for Ethereum (ETH) investors might be months away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Political priorities\" can prevent ETH ETF from being green-lit in 2024\n\nThe U.S. SEC is unlikely to approve exchange-traded funds based on spot Ether (ETH) in 2024, Variant's Jake Chervinsky says. This sad outcome is caused by political reasons that put the SEC leadership under pressure.\n\nI am a lot less confident about ETH ETF approval this year than many of you are.\n\n\n\nThe SEC got a ton of political blowback for approving BTC ETFs, even though the court basically forced it to.\n\n\n\nNow animal spirits are in control of the market, and an ETH ETF would only add to that. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) March 1, 2024\n\nEven though the U.S. court basically forced the SEC to authorize the Bitcoin spot ETFs launch in January 2023, the regulator received strong \"political blowback,\" Chervinsky added.\n\nIn this situation, the BTC ETFs approval is the fruit of collaboration between the SEC and ETFs applications, especially BlackRock.\n\nAs such, they will do their utmost to avoid conflict with the SEC and, most likely, will withdraw all ETH ETF applications should the SEC ask them to do so.\n\nThe context becomes even more hostile for Ether ETF given the fact that \"animal spirits\" took full control over the markets now.\n\n\"When, not if\" approach still valid\n\nSince the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, added over 30% in price. Last week, it peaked over $3,500.\n\nHowever, Chervinsky is sure that ETH ETFs will be approved sooner or later:\n\n\u201cWhen, not if\u201d seems like a very reasonable take to me\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Bloomberg's James Seyffart announced that he did not expect Ether ETF to go live in March 2024."

        "title": "The Evolution of Ethereum: Pioneering the Next Wave of Crypto Progress - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum has been at the forefront of the crypto world ever since its inception in 2013. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether, is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, trailing only behind Bitcoin. Ethereum has also been instrumental in mainstreaming several key trends, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the Metaverse. However, Ethereum community says the network is still far away from unleashing its potential and evolving until they reach the top.\n\nThe decentralized blockchain has even found its way into other walks of life, including gaming, art, and fashion thanks to the timely evolution of Ethereum ecosystem through upgradation. Businesses like online casinos are starting to use the platform to facilitate online transactions and payments. This Ethereum casino partnership has boosted the presence, with a popular resource for using Ethereum and we are seeing an overall increase in the market value of the blockchain and its cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, Ethereum came from a long journey and went through a lot of experiments before reaching the point where it is today. Here is a glimpse of the evolutions of Ethereum that fuel its growth.\n\nUpgrading the System\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum underwent a series of upgrades known collectively as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which successfully transitioned the platform\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. This transition vastly improved Ethereum\u2019s energy efficiency and security, reducing its energy consumption by 99%. Consequently, Ethereum is expected to gain global traction due to its enhanced focus on environmental and sustainability concerns.\n\nThe platform continuously evolves, adapting to market trends and global values. In the coming years, Ethereum plans to implement an update known as Danksharding. This update focuses on horizontal database scaling, aiming to enhance the management and storage of distributed data and increase the software\u2019s scalability.\n\nAs global attitudes and standards around cryptocurrency evolve, so too will Ethereum. Its versatility and unique adaptability enable it to navigate new trends with ease, maintaining its position at the forefront of the crypto world and cementing its status as a leading cryptocurrency.\n\nInnovations and Expansions\n\nEthereum\u2019s commitment to innovation is clear in its roadmap, which includes several significant upgrades beyond Danksharding. These upgrades are designed to improve the network\u2019s scalability, security, and sustainability, ensuring that Ethereum remains at the forefront of blockchain technology. Many experts believes that such upgrade will play pivotal role in the evolution of Ethereum.\n\nThe introduction of sharding is expected to further decentralize the network, increasing transactions per second and reducing gas fees. This will make the platform more accessible and efficient for users worldwide.\n\nThe Rise of Decentralized Applications (dApps)\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) is one of its most compelling features. These applications utilize Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality to offer a wide range of services, from finance to gaming, without the need for traditional intermediaries.\n\nThe expanding dApp market indicates a shift towards a more decentralized internet, with Ethereum leading the way. As the platform becomes more user-friendly and scalable, the adoption of dApps is expected to increase, potentially revolutionizing industries by promoting transparency, efficiency, and trust.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Role in the Financial Ecosystem\n\nThe DeFi sector, primarily built on Ethereum, demonstrates the platform\u2019s ability to reimagine financial services. From lending and borrowing platforms to stablecoins and tokenized assets, Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem offers permissionless, transparent, and efficient alternatives, challenging the traditional financial sector.\n\nAs the DeFi space matures, it could significantly diminish the market share of conventional financial institutions, positioning Ethereum as the backbone of a new financial paradigm.\n\nAlso Read: How Ethereum Blockchain Is Shaping The Education Sector\n\nSurge In ETH\u2019s Value\n\nOver the coming years, Ether and Ethereum are both set up for positive growth. According to binance, at the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price is $3,481.61. Experts predict this to propel upwards to around $40,000 by the end of 2030. While some remain skeptical of this figure, others point to Ethereum\u2019s scalability, uniqueness, and market range as factors that could make it a reality.\n\nBut will Ethereum eventually overtake Bitcoin as the world\u2019s number-one cryptocurrency? The crypto market is highly volatile and fickle, so it is certainly a possibility.\n\nETH has experienced considerably higher levels of growth in recent years, increasing in value by nearly 400% in 2021 compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 66%. And thanks to Ethereum\u2019s unique decentralized blockchain model, many experts believe it has the potential to outperform Bitcoin within the next ten years.\n\nChallenges and Considerations\n\nDespite its promising future, Ethereum faces several challenges. Scalability issues, high transaction fees, and network congestion have been significant obstacles. However, the ongoing upgrades and the shift towards a more sustainable and efficient framework are expected to mitigate these concerns.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory uncertainties and the competitive landscape of blockchain technologies are factors that could influence Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey is far from over. Its pioneering role in popularizing smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi has set the stage for a future where blockchain technology is integral to various sectors. With continuous upgrades and increasing adoption of its platform, Ethereum is well-positioned to remain a key player in the cryptocurrency space, potentially challenging Bitcoin\u2019s dominance.\n\nThe amalgamation of technological advancements, community support, and a robust ecosystem renders Ethereum\u2019s future not just promising but stellar, envisioning a landscape where innovation, inclusivity, and efficiency are paramount.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored post.

A \"rollup\" is a term for a layer-2 chain, which acts like an auxiliary network to provide faster and cheaper transactions that can then be settled to a main or \"base\" blockchain like Ethereum. The \"ZK\" refers to \"zero-knowledge\" cryptography, a hot trend in blockchain design."

        "content": "Buoyed by the bullish market momentum, Solana has recaptured investors\u2019 sentiment, steering attention away from Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL is on the cusp of breaking new records as the token approaches a 2-year high. From less than $10 a year ago, the leading altcoin exceeded $130, a whopping 500% surge.\n\nSimilarly, the trading volume of the 5th largest crypto asset has spiked 120% to $3.2 million. Market experts have drawn parallels between SOL\u2019s price trajectory and that of Ethereum in 2020. If the rest of the cycle plays out similarly, a takeoff is imminent.\n\nSOL still really reminds me of ETH in 2020. Pretty sure the rest of the cycle plays out similarly too, expecting takeoff soon. Bring it on.\n\nWhile price is one way to look at it, the other perspective is revenue, as gauged by the gas fees of the respective blockchains. And Solana\u2019s gas fees have been soaring, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of Ethereum\u2019s gas fees. In February 2023, Solana\u2019s daily gas fees were less than 0.2% of Ethtereum\u2019s. In January 2024, the table flipped as Solana\u2019s daily gas fees exceeded 8% of Ethereum\u2019s, making a nearly 40-fold increase.\n\nImage Credit: PYOR\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi TVL has also scored a new milestone, surpassing $2 billion, a level not seen in the last 20 months. The new feat is a testament to its robust DeFi ecosystem, which has bounced back strongly since the 2022 FTX collapse. Since December, the total value locked has doubled, indicating increased user activity and trust in the platform\u2019s DeFi applications [DApps]. The blockchain\u2019s scalability and affordability make it a cheaper and faster alternative to Ethereum.\n\nSolana: Dynamics of DEX Volume and Notable Sector Gains\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is that while constituting less than 3% of total DeFi TVL, Solana generates over 20% of the overall on-chain DEX volume. Along with SOL, Ethereum, Manta, and Arbitrum also recorded notable gains. This uptrend marks the fourth consecutive month of growth for DeFi since it finally broke its downtrend in October 2023.\n\nMarket observers have noted that the liquid staking and lending/borrowing sectors led the surge across key protocols, culminating in a robust DeFi week for Solana."

        "content": "Blockchain news: the official mainnet of the Ethereum Layer 2 Blast chain has recently been released, allowing users to withdraw their funds.\n\nSo far, more than 180,000 early access users have already deposited a total value of over 2.3 billion dollars on the protocol platform. Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe future of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain: Blast Layer 2 mainnet promises significant benefits\n\nAs anticipated, the mainnet of the Ethereum Layer 2 Blast blockchain network was launched on Thursday, offering users the possibility to withdraw their funds.\n\nAccording to the dashboard of Dune Analytics, the platform hosts significant assets, including approximately 469,000 ETH, 77.3 million USDC, 67.1 million USDT, 148,000 stETH, and 24.7 million DAI.\n\nWith the live mainnet, users can now easily make withdrawals. The mind behind Blast is Tieshun Roquerre, the founder of the NFT marketplace Blur.\n\nThe platform\u2019s goal is to provide a native yield model for both Ether and stablecoins, offering a 4% interest for the former and 5% for the latter.\n\nEarly access to the platform has attracted over 180,000 members of the community, helping to reach a total value locked (TVL) of over 2.3 billion dollars, according to the official website.\n\nBefore the mainnet launch, users noticed the emergence of an unofficial bridge to the platform, drawing parallels with the event prior to the launch of Coinbase\u2019s Base Layer 2 in early August 2023.\n\nArnold Toh, blockchain research analyst at The Block, highlighted that Blast has already accumulated over $2 billion in TVL before the official launch. In particular, positioning itself as a significant presence alongside Layer 2 giants like Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet.\n\nThe analyst predicts significant interest and speculation with the official launch, as well as the possibility of a future airdrop.\n\nBlast: potential success, the mainnet and promising returns\n\nThe early access to Blast started towards the end of November 2023, offering users the opportunity to earn returns through bridging and Blast Points.\n\nOr a form of reward for linking assets to other networks and for referring users to the platform.\n\nThe philosophy of Blast is based on market efficiency, emphasizing that liquidity flows towards higher returns.\n\nAs stated by the social media platform, on Blast, the balance is automatically composed, offering users the opportunity to earn Blast rewards.\n\nHowever, some voices have raised doubts about the platform model, suggesting similarities with a Ponzi scheme, especially since rewards were not withdrawable until the mainnet launch.\n\nHowever, Tieshun Roquerre, also known as Pacman, has rejected such claims, arguing that the performance is sustainable and derived from the liquid staking protocols of Lido and MakerDAO\u2019s DeFi.\n\nThe success of Blast was evident with a fundraising of 20 million dollars in November 2023, led by venture companies Paradigm and Standard Crypto. The possibility to redeem Blast points is initially scheduled for May 24th.\n\nEthereum lays the groundwork for \u201cThe Surge\u201d with the anticipated Dencun update\n\nAs we know, Ethereum\u2019s roadmap envisions a revolutionary era with the introduction of the Dencun update, paving the way for layer two rollups to achieve large-scale scalability.\n\nThis fundamental step promises to improve transaction speed, reduce gas fees, and enhance overall network performance.\n\nPositioning Ethereum as the main blockchain platform for decentralized apps and smart contracts.\n\nThe recent bullish trend of Ethereum, with the price reaching $3,230 on February 26, is a reflection of the market\u2019s optimism towards the Dencun upgrade.\n\nInvestors and traders are showing increasing confidence in the long-term prospects of Ethereum, intensifying buying activity and pushing the price to new highs.\n\nThis rally underlines the importance of the Dencun update and the expected positive transformation of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe Ethereum community is eagerly awaiting the Dencun update, anticipating a significant improvement in the functionality and efficiency of the network.\n\nSpecifically, the community is hoping for faster transactions, greater scalability, and lower gas fees, considering this upgrade as a crucial initial step in addressing persistent challenges and realizing the full potential of Ethereum.\n\nThe enthusiasm in the community expresses confidence in Ethereum\u2019s ability to grow and adapt to the evolving needs of its vast user base, with the hope of a better user experience and smoother operation of decentralized applications."

Discover SCENE\n\nJust two days after the launch of Blast, an Ethereum layer-2 network from the founder of dominant NFT marketplace Blur, hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed into newly created protocols living on the network\u2014and buzz is growing about several other projects emerging in the ecosystem.\n\nThe network already boasts a total value locked (TVL) north of $2.4 billion, according to the Blast website. Many users have flocked to Blast in order to capitalize on future airdrops that may reward early users of applications and protocols within the network.\n\nAlready, clear winners have emerged, with some DeFi protocols receiving huge sums of investment, and other games and tokens garnering sizable attention on social media. Here\u2019s a glance at some of the projects dominating Blast in its first days.\n\nOrbit Protocol\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith a TVL of over $200 million, Orbit is currently the hottest DeFi protocol built within the Blast ecosystem. The protocol allows users to lend and borrow assets while remaining within Blast, and incentivizes users by letting them earn liquid rewards in the process. It also boasts its own native token, ORBIT.\n\nOrbit lending/borrowing and the $ORBIT token are now both live on @Blast_L2 mainnet\ud83e\udd6e\ud83d\ude80 Heres how you can skip the endless points by earning liquid $ORBIT yield and owning your Blast allocation \ud83e\uddf5 Get started:https://t.co/Aikku3Tr77 pic.twitter.com/Xu5bpP3vl0 \u2014 Orbit Protocol \ud83e\udd6e (@OrbitLending) March 1, 2024\n\nSpacebar\n\nSpacebar, which refers to itself as an \u201con-chain playground,\u201d is a gamified platform on which users are encouraged to interact and engage with each other to earn various types of points. Users connect their profile picture (PFP) NFTs to the ecosystem to create an avatar, and also mint new NFTs within the Spacebar game world.\n\nSpacebar also incentivizes users to stake ETH within the platform to earn additional rewards. A major pull to the project appears to be the promise of an upcoming airdrop to early and active participants.\n\nDegens, we are live on @Blast_L2 with Phase 1 \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude80 If you're looking for the best playground to play and farm, you found your home. \ud83c\udfe1 In Phase 1, you can:\n\n- Choose a PFP NFT as your digital identity on Spacebar.\n\n- Mint a free Blast Protoship NFT.\n\n- Stake $ETH.\n\n- Refer friends.\n\n-\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6I1koiIpLX \u2014 Spacebar \ud83d\ude80 (@spacebarxyz) February 29, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPac Finance\n\nThe first hybrid lending protocol to launch on Blast, Pac Finance facilitates both peer to peer loans, and peer to pool loans on the Blast network. The project includes features like self-repaying loans, one-click leverage trading, and instant lending loops. The platform is currently pledging quantities of Blast\u2019s yet-to-launch native token, which it received after winning the blockchain\u2019s \u201cBig Bang\u201d app development competition, to early adopters.\n\nPacMoon\n\nThe self-proclaimed \u201ccommunity meme coin\u201d of the Blast ecosystem, PacMoon is a decidedly independent token project that took off this week to much fanfare. The token, PAC, has yet to launch\u2014it will via airdrop at some point \u201csoon,\u201d according to the project\u2019s team. But in the meantime, it has generated a frenzy on Twitter, where posts about the coin noticed by the PacMoon team are purportedly being rewarded with PAC allocations.\n\n1.

You can stack likes and rts for more $PAC. \u2014 PACMOON (@pacmoon_) February 29, 2024\n\nZerolend\n\nAnother lending market on Blast, Zerolend incentivizes users to borrow and lend a range of tokens in exchange for rewards in ETH, BLAST, and ZERO, the protocol\u2019s native token. Unlike Orbit Protocol and Pac Finance, Zerolend already exists on two other blockchains: Manta and zkSync Era.\n\nDistrictOne\n\nDistrictOne is a gamified, incentivized group messaging platform built on Blast. By liking messages and engaging with posts, DistrictOne users can collectively earn rewards and compete for jackpots. A key element of the ecosystem are \u201cgems,\u201d which are rewarded to users for high engagement, and earn them spots in weekly and ongoing airdrops.\n\n3. \ud83c\udfae Gamified Spaces\n\nD1 transforms group interactions into thrilling rallies with jackpots.

        "content": "Robinhood is well-known as a financial services company that offers a trading platform accessible via a mobile app and website. Robinhood has gained popularity for democratizing investing by offering commission-free trades of stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and cryptocurrencies. This approach has made financial markets more accessible to a broader audience, including younger and more tech-savvy investors who might be interested in cryptocurrencies alongside traditional investments.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s platform supports trading of several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, among others. It allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without paying a commission, similar to its policy for stock trades. This feature has contributed to the platform\u2019s popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors looking for an easy and cost-effective way to enter the crypto market.\n\nIn a groundbreaking announcement made at ETHDenver on February 29, Robinhood unveiled a strategic collaboration with Arbitrum, a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This partnership aims to simplify access to decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer 2 networks, promising to enhance the way Robinhood Wallet users interact with the crypto ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve the scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness of Ethereum transactions. As a Layer 2 solution, Arbitrum operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) and aims to address some of the main challenges faced by the Ethereum network, including high gas fees and slow transaction times, without compromising on security.\n\nArbitrum uses a technology called Optimistic Rollups to achieve its goals. Optimistic Rollups essentially bundle (or \u201croll up\u201d) multiple transactions into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet. This process significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the Ethereum blockchain, leading to faster transaction speeds and lower costs.\n\nThe collaboration between Robinhood and Arbitrum is set to open doors for Robinhood Wallet users, granting them seamless access to Arbitrum swaps through decentralized exchanges. According to Robinhood\u2019s press release, this integration addresses some of the most pressing challenges in the crypto space: high transaction costs and slow transaction speeds that have hindered the broader adoption of blockchain technologies. By leveraging Arbitrum\u2019s advanced scaling solutions, users can now enjoy the benefits of low transaction fees and enhanced speed on one of the crypto ecosystem\u2019s most popular networks.\n\nLooking ahead, Robinhood and Arbitrum have committed to expanding their partnership to include support for cross-chain swaps and launching campaigns aimed at reducing the barriers to utilizing web3 functionalities within the Robinhood Wallet.\n\nJohann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto, emphasized the critical role of Ethereum gas fees in securing the network, while also acknowledging the deterrent effect these fees can have on new adopters. He highlighted how Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, renowned for its total-locked value, address these concerns by making L2 access and transactions more user-friendly for those new to the web3 space. The Robinhood Wallet now serves as a gateway, removing the complexities traditionally associated with navigating the DeFi landscape.\n\nA.J. Warner, Chief Strategy Officer at Offchain Labs, the team behind Arbitrum, expressed enthusiasm about integrating Robinhood Wallet into the Arbitrum ecosystem. This move is anticipated to significantly impact the DeFi community on Arbitrum, bringing Robinhood\u2019s vast user base into the fold with low-cost in-app swaps. Warner views this collaboration as a pivotal moment for web3 democratization, empowering users to delve deeper into the possibilities of decentralized finance.\n\nThe Robinhood Wallet, a self-custody solution, empowers users to take full control of their digital assets across multiple networks, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Base. By allowing users to hold their private keys, Robinhood ensures that users maintain complete ownership of their crypto assets. The wallet is designed to cater to a broad spectrum of users, from beginners seeking intuitive interfaces to experienced traders looking for advanced tools.\n\nThe Robinhood Wallet is available for download on iOS, with an Android version slated for release soon.\n\nFeatured Image via iOS App Store"

The upside could be captured on Bitcoin, meaning a rotation towards altcoins. Therefore, Ethereum to $4,500-5,000 is likely, while altcoins will accelerate with 2-4x returns. pic.twitter.com/FKEaPpjrZv \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 29, 2024\n\nIt\u2019s worth recalling that layer-2s on Ethereum are experiencing a boom in Total Value Locked, pushing ETH to new peaks. Moreover, it seems the attention is shifting to the possibility of an Ethereum spot ETF by May 2024.\n\nThis week, multiple altcoins have exploded in price, especially meme coins like WIF and PEPE. Solana reached an intraday high of $134, gaining over 10% in 24 hours.\n\nPossible Bitcoin Correction?\n\nRegarding Bitcoin, Van de Poppe hinted at a possible correction following the substantial net inflows driven by institutional demand. He pinpoints possible support levels at $46,000 or $53,000.\n\nPoppe is not the only analyst warning about retraces. Daniel Yan, co-founder at Matrixport, warned against a possible correction of 15% by the end of April, which would be around $52,000-$53,000.\n\nSimilarly, well-known crypto trader Ali (Ali_Charts on X) reports a notable increase in profit-taking by Bitcoin whales, highlighting that over the past three days, they\u2019ve sold off more than 80,000 BTC, equivalent to around $4.8 billion.\n\nAli also pointed out that the TD Sequential indicator has signaled a sell on the 4-hour chart for Bitcoin. He notes that since February 15, \u201cevery sell signal from this indicator has been spot-on, leading to $BTC price corrections between 1.50% and 4.20%.\u201d\n\nHowever, only time will tell whether Bitcoin will find and sustain support above $50K or correct below that figure. One thing remains true \u2014Bitcoin and the overall crypto market have had their best month in years, with BTC adding thousands of dollars to its price daily and most altcoins going vertical this week."

        "title": "Filecoin is riding the boom in liquid staking - DLNews",
        "content": "Liquid staking is booming on Filecoin.\n\nMost of the increase has come from the GLIF protocol.\n\nGLIF said it intends to launch a points system, a trend among Ethereum and Solana DeFi applications.\n\nAlmost one year after the introduction of Ethereum-style smart contracts, so-called liquid staking protocols are booming on Filecoin, a blockchain built to store data.\n\nSince January 1, the value of crypto locked in Filecoin\u2019s dozen liquid staking protocols has grown to more than $450 million from $272 million.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign users are becoming more familiar with Filecoin and its nascent DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIt\u2019s also another sign that users love the points systems that have taken over Ethereum and Solana, too.\n\nA \u201clikely catalyst\u201d for Filecoin\u2019s recent growth \u201cis the anticipation of rewards programs that incentivise user activity,\u201d Messari analyst Mihai Grigore told DL News.\n\nLike airdrops \u2014 projects\u2019 distributions of free tokens to reward early or loyal users \u2014 points programs, which function much like traditional businesses\u2019 rewards programs, can juice user activity.\n\nUnlike airdrops, however, they allow US-based projects to avoid the regulatory headache that can come with promising or issuing tokens.\n\nAs such, they have spread like wildfire among decentralised finance applications on Ethereum and Solana. They appear to be a powerful incentive on Filecoin, too.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOf the dozen liquid staking protocols tracked by DefiLlama, all have grown at least 48% in the past month. But GLIF, the largest, has separated itself from the pack.\n\nGLIF is a long-running project on Filecoin. It built one of the blockchain\u2019s first wallets, according to founder Jon Schwartz. When Filecoin developers added smart contract functionality in March 2023, GLIF built a liquid staking service.\n\nDeposits to GLIF have skyrocketed since early February, when it announced a $4.5 million raise and the launch of a points system sometime in the first quarter of the year.\n\nSince then, the total value of crypto locked in GLIF has more than doubled. On February 22, user activity briefly overloaded GLIF\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cYear-to-date, GLIF\u2019s increase in net deposits of [about] 6.9 million FIL accounted for nearly 76% of the total DeFi net deposits on Filecoin,\u201d Grigore said. That figure doesn\u2019t account for collateral posted by borrowers on GLIF.\n\nSchwartz attributes the jump to points and to growing comfort with Filecoin.\n\nWhen Filecoin developers launched the blockchain in October 2020, there were only 11 built-in smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThat would be analogous to Ethereum having, say, 11 smart contracts, and those were the only ones you could really use on the network,\u201d Schwartz told DL News. \u201cNo developers like myself could deploy custom smart contract logic to the chain.\u201d\n\nThat changed last March, when developers introduced smart contract functionality.\n\nThat change brought Ethereum-style smart contracts on Filecoin, enabling DeFi use cases, \u201cnotably liquid staking,\u201d Grigore said.\n\nSchwartz believes the blockchain is now reaping the benefits of that paradigm change.\n\n\u201cYou know how these things go, especially with new and immature networks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time for DeFi to develop and for people to get comfortable.\u201d\n\nLiquid leasing\n\nLiquid staking is the biggest business on Ethereum. As of Wednesday, users had deposited more than $46 billion in cryptocurrencies in Ethereum\u2019s three dozen liquid staking protocols.\n\nThat\u2019s because it addresses a key issue with Ethereum\u2019s so-called proof-of-stake security system, which was adopted in September 2022.\n\nIn a proof-of-stake system, security, as well as the privilege of confirming and ordering transactions, comes from users willing to lock up, or stake, their Ether in exchange for a modest annual yield.\n\nLiquid staking protocols address the opportunity cost that comes with locking away one\u2019s Ether by issuing derivative tokens, which typically trade at par with Ether and are accepted in its stead by decentralised exchanges and lending protocols.\n\nFilecoin isn\u2019t a proof-of-stake blockchain, and Schwartz prefers to call GLIF a \u201cliquid leasing\u201d protocol.\n\n\u201cThat said, the problem space the GLIF is filling for Filecoin is pretty much the same problem space that, say, Lido is building for Ethereum, or Jito for Solana,\u201d he said, referring to other blockchains\u2019 liquid staking protocols. \u201cBut the mechanisms are different.\u201d\n\nFilecoin\u2019s big year\n\nIt\u2019s just the beginning of what could be a busy year for Filecoin.\n\nEarlier this month, Filecoin and Solana project Triton One announced a partnership, in which Triton would store Solana data on Filecoin.\n\nDevelopers behind billion-dollar decentralised exchange Uniswap deployed the protocol to Filecoin this week. SushiSwap developers launched their decentralised exchange on the blockchain in November.\n\n\u201cA lot of these new projects that have components that were built on the [smart contract functionality] \u2026 they\u2019ll come out this year,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to look like a different Filecoin, simply because what\u2019s possible this year was not possible in the three, four years prior,\u201d he added.\n\nAleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent for DL News.

Over $50 million has already been traded, mostly in memecoins like BlastCat.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana has broken through a critical resistance level, marking a potential trend shift for the cryptocurrency. The chart indicates a significant break of the upper trendline resistance, establishing a new movement scenario for the asset.\n\nSolana has showcased remarkable price performance, as evidenced by its latest rally past the upper trendline of its ascending channel. This breakthrough is a classical technical confirmation of bullish sentiment, and it suggests the possibility of a sustained upward trajectory. With SOL's price pushing through the $130 mark, the cryptocurrency has not only defied immediate resistance but has set the stage for testing further highs.\n\nLooking at the support levels, Solana's price is comfortably positioned above the 50-day (orange line) and 100-day (blue line) moving averages, which have historically acted as dynamic support in uptrends.\n\nThe immediate support level now stands around the $107 mark, which coincides with the previous resistance-turned-support trendline. The robust volume accompanying the breakout adds credence to the bullish outlook, indicating strong buyer interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, the next resistance level to watch is near the $140 zone, where profit-taking and psychological round numbers may temporarily stall the rally.\n\nEthereum looks unstoppable\n\nEthereum continues its meteoric rise, currently showcasing a price surge that has left investors and enthusiasts in a state of euphoria. However, amid the celebration, if a vigilant eye is cast toward the chart, signs of a potential bearish reversal loom, warranting a closer analysis of the second-largest cryptocurrency's extraordinary rally.\n\nEthereum's rally has been nothing short of spectacular, with prices breaking past resistance levels with apparent ease. As of the latest trading sessions, ETH stands tall above $3,500, yet this unstoppable rally may have investors questioning the sustainability of such growth.\n\nShould a reversal occur, the focus would shift to potential support levels that could cushion Ethereum's descent. The $2,695 mark emerges as a critical juncture, aligning with the 50-day moving average, a dynamic level that historically serves as a battleground between bulls and bears. A breach below this level could see Ethereum testing the $2,065 support, near the 100-day moving average, which may provide a stronger foundation for the digital asset.\n\nThe current trend indicates that while the market is riding a wave of optimism, caution is advised. Ethereum has defied traditional market expectations, but no asset is immune to corrections. The foreseeable future suggests that if traders begin to lock in profits, a bearish scenario could unfold, triggering a sell-off toward the identified support zones.\n\nBitcoin's strength is rising\n\nThe cryptocurrency flagship, Bitcoin (BTC), is showcasing a formidable display of strength on the market, with its price trajectory pointing sharply upward. As the market rides a wave of euphoria, the question on many investors' minds is whether Bitcoin is poised to reach new all-time highs in the near future.\n\nBitcoin's price has been on a relentless climb, and the latest candles on the chart reflect significant buyer confidence. Currently, the price has surged past the $60,000 resistance level, an important psychological barrier that could now be serving as a platform for further gains. The steep ascent is accompanied by a substantial increase in trading volume, indicating a strong conviction behind the move.\n\nThe moving averages - 50-day, 100-day and 200-day - are aligned in ascending order, which is a classic bullish signal. These lines are likely to act as dynamic support levels in the event of a price retracement. The 50-day moving average, in particular, has been a reliable support throughout the recent rally, suggesting that any dips might be viewed as buying opportunities by bullish investors.\n\nAs of now, the RSI is trending toward overbought territory, suggesting that Bitcoin is extending into an area where a reversal could occur. However, during strong trends, assets can remain overbought for extended periods, defying the traditional expectations of an immediate pullback."

Notably, some are now actively debating and analyzing which of the two, ETH or BTC, holds greater investment potential.\n\nOne such investor is renowned analyst \u201cImNotTheWolf\u201d who took to Twitter on Saturday to share his views expressing a preference for buying ETH over BTC.\n\nThe analyst outlined the reasons behind the decision, first emphasizing the narrowing window of opportunity for Bitcoin market cap dominance. He further shared the weekly chart showing that BTC dominance trend has hit a major downtrend resistance along the 55% level. According to him, a rejection along this trendline could see Bitcoins dominance recoil further in coming months, making Ethereum\u2019s to rise.\n\n\u201cBitcoin Dominance only has a spread of +4% before hitting my \u2018target\u2019 of a major downtrend resistance, vs a -30% difference to the downside (which is where I believe Ethereum will shine).\u201d Wrote the pundit.\n\nTo further back his argument, the analyst speculated that Bitcoin\u2019s ETF volume would be redirected into Ethereum, explaining, \u201cThe Bitcoin ETF was somewhat largely \u2018priced in,\u2019 and the quick move has already played out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further predicted that savvy institutional players would use incoming institutional volume as \u2018exit liquidity\u2019 to secure profits on Bitcoin, shifting to larger positions in Ethereum. Additionally, he pointed to the anticipation of an spot Ethereum ETF and the upcoming launch of BLAST, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network, suggesting that these events could usher in a new \u2018DeFi Summer\u2019 and \u2018Altcoin Spring.\u2019 Notably, major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity have sought approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, signalling growing institutional interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nMoreover, the upcoming Dencun upgrade, set to bring enhanced scalability and reduced transactions costs is anticipated to further bolster Ethereum\u2019s market position as well as the price of ETH.\n\nThat said, the pundit concluded by urging investors to make prudent investment choices, suggesting that this might be the last \u2018cycle\u2019 before a potentially prolonged bear market triggered by over-regulation.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you play your cards right\u2026 one cycle will be all you need to achieve financial freedom,\u201d he noted."

Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nA watershed event awaits\n\nSuch numbers come at a time when the L2 proponents and the broader Ethereum ecosystem were eagerly awaiting for the Dencun Upgrade. The biggest upgrade since last year\u2019s Shapella, Dencun was expected to bring about a whopping 10x reduction in L2 transaction fees.\n\nIf these estimates come true, the ETH L2 ecosystem might hold the vast majority of all DeFi users and apps in the near future."

        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Binance Coin.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum impressed with its rally this week after booking a 16.3% price increase. In the process, buyers managed to break the resistance at $3,340 and re-test it as a key support.\n\nWhile the trend remains firmly bullish, the momentum indicators appear a bit over-extended, which could make buyers exhausted if they continue at this rate. Only in February ETH increased by over 50% with little pullbacks.\n\nLooking ahead, the most important target for ETH is found at $4,000, which will also act as a resistance.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nDespite the volatility this week, XRP still managed to close in profit with an 11% price increase, and buyers successfully defended the support at 54 cents.\n\nBulls have a good shot at taking XRP higher in March after the correction that started back in November ended last month. The next target and resistance is found at 69 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, XRP has turned bullish, and the buying volume has returned to levels not seen since 2023. These are clear signals that the buyers are in charge.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano impressed with a 17.6% price increase this week after briefly reaching 70 cents. This performance allowed bulls to make a new local high.\n\nThe support is found at 60 cents, and the current target for this rally is 82 cents. If buyers continue at this rate in March, then the next target is only a week away.\n\nLooking ahead, ADA bulls have returned in full force after the most recent correction ended in late February. The trend is bullish, and March looks primed for higher levels.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana made a new high this year and nearly reached $138, making it the best-performing cryptocurrency on our list this week, with an impressive 31% price increase.\n\nSOL also broke above the $126 resistance, which has since turned into a key support. Considering the buy volume, this rally seems more likely to continue.\n\nLooking ahead, after the latest breakout, Solana\u2019s target has moved to $163, which will also act as a key resistance.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin reached $400 and managed to close the week with an 8% price increase. The current support is at $377, and resistance is at $437.\n\nEven if this rally enters a pullback later, the larger trend remains bullish. If it continues, it could see BNB continue to make higher highs.\n\nLooking ahead, this cryptocurrency is well-positioned to challenge the all-time high at $692 this year and maybe even exceed it."

        "content": "Never say never. That\u2019s what seemed to be the case after a dormant Ethereum (ETH) whale woke up to send tokens worth $5.15 million. There had been no activity in the wallet address for around a decade. The tokens were sent to the crypto exchange Kraken. The development comes days after Ethereum crossed $3,000.\n\nThe sudden whale activity also highlights the potential of Ethereum as the next token to power a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). As concerns about the legal aspects of BTC ETF continue, many analysts have suggested Ethereum ETFs might be a solution to the problem because of their versatility.\n\nThe altcoins that have been seeing rising user interest were NEAR Protocol and InQubeta (QUBE). While NEAR Protocol is a developer-friendly protocol for deploying Web 3.0 solutions, InQubeta is a fundraising service for AI projects. Its presale funding recently crossed $10.4 million.\n\nInQubeta: Helping AI startups discover new milestones\n\nInQubeta is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that doubles up as a business development ecosystem for AI startups. Its collection of services helps startups shed inhibitions and grow their business models using blockchain-based solutions.\n\nFor crypto users, InQubeta is among the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. It facilitates seamless investments in AI projects. The startups selected by InQubeta have to go through intensive screening to ensure that only the best make the cut. Startups can then raise funds by minting equity based NFTs that can be bought by investors on the InQubeta platform.\n\nIts native cryptocurrency, the QUBE token, is a deflationary asset and can be staked. By adding InQubeta to their portfolio, people wouldn\u2019t have to think about what cryptos to buy now for a long time.\n\nA total token supply of 1.5 billion is split between different uses like presale, paying legal fees, compensating developers, funding marketing campaigns, and giving out staking rewards \u2013 that\u2019s what InQubeta\u2019s tokenomics looks like. The largest share of the token is for the presale. Only 35% of the stock of coins goes towards the expenses.\n\nGiven its presale success, the QUBE token today is a part of top analysts\u2019 best cryptocurrency ICO lists.\n\nEthereum L2 Zircuit draws $128 million in deposits within 24 hours\n\nEthereum is a popular blockchain technology that can be customized to roll out a range of solutions like decentralized identities, blockchains, and crypto assets.\n\nTransactions made using its native token ETH are validated with the proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Its popularity has also drawn attention to its potential to power the next crypto ETF.\n\nMarket experts suggest that the ETH token can do a better job of countering regulatory challenges for ETFs.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been in the news after Zircuit, a Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum, drew over $128 million within 24 hours after it started accepting deposits. Zircuit allows crypto users to stake restaked and staked assets.\n\nNEAR Protocol\u2019s new wallet gains 300,000 users in 48 hours\n\nNEAR Protocol is an emerging crypto that offers new-age tools for building powerful dApps. Developers can find multiple resources to upskill and share their ideas with professionals from the Web 3.0 industry.\n\nThe platform\u2019s native token NEAR is used for all on-chain transactions. The Near protocol has registered a strong interest from developers due to its easy to use interface and ability to deploy dApps at the click of a button.\n\nThe platform recently released a self-custodial wallet called HERE. The wallet created a record of sorts after it clocked around 300,000 registrations within 48 hours of launch.\n\nIts USP is that Telegram users can seamlessly set up a blockchain-powered wallet.\n\nConclusion\n\nInQuebea, Ethereum, and NEAR Protocol are altcoins to watch out for this year as they haven\u2019t let market volatility get to them till now. These tokens have posted consistent returns that have even trumped analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nThese crypto projects have been in the news for different reasons which has enabled them to garner more token holders. As Ethereum drew more users because of its upcoming Dencun upgrade, NEAR Protocol hit the headlines with an airdrop. InQubeta, meanwhile, grabbed the spotlight with its presale success. The collective impact of these tokens also helped with market recovery.\n\nMarket experts suggest that these tokens have a long way to go as they have high growth potential. Chances are people might see InQubeta, NEAR Protocol, and Ethereum leading the next crypto bull rally.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Lark Davis predicts a massive market cap of $10 trillion for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThis projection, if realized, would mark a historic moment for the industry, attracting substantial capital.\n\nWhile the prediction is optimistic, achieving a $10 trillion market cap would bring its own set of challenges.\n\nProminent crypto investor Lark Davis has stirred conversations with his audacious projection: a monumental $10 trillion market cap for the cryptocurrency space.\n\n10 Trillion dollar market, highly possible this cycle, equates to\u2026\n\n\n\nBitcoin $250,000\n\nEthereum $15,000\n\nSolana $700 \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) February 29, 2024\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the figures and unravel the potential implications.\n\nCurrent Market Momentum\n\nPresently, the overall market cap of the cryptocurrency space has reached $2.4 trillion, showcasing a substantial rise from the $800 billion recorded at the start of the year.\n\nThis surge follows a period of recovery from a bear market, where Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, experienced a significant decline from its all-time high of $69,000 to a low of around $16,000.\n\nShould Davis\u2019s foresight materialize, Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for an extraordinary surge from its current trading price of $61,500. This represents a potential increase of nearly 400%, reaching the projected price of $250,000. Achieving this valuation would necessitate a significant influx of capital into the Bitcoin market, currently valued at around $1.19 trillion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s $15,000 Vision\n\nIn Davis\u2019s forecast, Ethereum (ETH) is predicted to trade at around $15,000, signaling a substantial increase from its current value. Ethereum, with a current market cap of approximately $280 billion, would need considerable capital inflow to reach the projected price.\n\nThis surge would position Ethereum as a formidable player in the market, underlining its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract technology.\n\nSolana Isn\u2019t Far Behind Either!\n\nDavis\u2019s projections extend to Solana (SOL), earmarked for a surge to $700. With Solana\u2019s current market cap standing at approximately $23 billion, achieving the predicted price would involve heightened investor interest and significant capital injection. This potential surge positions Solana as a significant player in the blockchain ecosystem, contributing to the ongoing narrative of scalable and high-performance blockchain platforms.\n\nImplications of a $10 Trillion Market Cap\n\nBeyond the exciting projections lies the potential realization of a historic milestone\u2014a $10 trillion market cap for the cryptocurrency space. This achievement would not only mark a significant moment in the industry\u2019s history but also introduce new opportunities and challenges for market participants."

        "content": "The Ethereum deflationary memecoin, $PEPE, has experienced a remarkable surge of over 145% in its price over the past seven days, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nIn a recent development, a smart whale identified as 0x37d has made significant moves in the $PEPE market. The whale recently deposited a staggering 1.97 trillion $PEPE tokens, valued at $6.06 million, to Binance just a few hours ago.\n\nThis strategic move potentially positions the whale to capitalize on substantial gains, with an estimated profit of $3.47 million, representing a remarkable 135% increase if the tokens are indeed sold at current prices.\n\nAfter $PEPE reached new ATH, smart whale 0x37d deposited all 1.97T $PEPE ($6.06M) to #Binance ~7hrs ago, making $3.47M (+135%) if truly selling. Moreover, the whale withdrew 75.91B $SHIB ($893K) from #Binance for the first time ~1hr ago.

Notably, the trader deposited 470 billion $PEPE tokens to Binance at a price of $0.000003007.\n\nThe cumulative deposits amounted to 1.97 trillion $PEPE tokens over the past few hours, with an average acquisition price of $0.000003073, translating to a substantial investment of $6.06 million.\n\nPepe Whale Address Reveals Further Movements And Holdings\n\nAnalysis of the whale\u2019s portfolio reveals insights into past and current profit and loss scenarios.\n\nWhile the whale once realized an estimated profit of $614,000, representing a 21.9% increase from ETH holdings, current holdings in SAND and MANA indicate losses of $116,000 and $20,100, respectively, totaling $136,100.\n\nDespite the recent surge in $PEPE price, reaching a new all-time high of $0.000003524 nine hours ago, the market experienced a slight downturn of 3.38% in the past hour.\n\nThis decline may be attributed to the impact of the whale\u2019s selling activity, reflecting the significant influence of large investors on market dynamics.\n\nAs $PEPE continues to capture attention within the crypto community, the actions of whales and traders play a pivotal role in shaping its market trajectory, driving speculation and interest among investors.\n\nDisclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Electrum - Best Bitcoin wallet for desktop\n\nIf you are a Bitcoin holder and want a wallet for your desktop or Android device, Electrum is a great choice.

For example, Electrum can be used as a multisig wallet, and it also supports third-party plugins.\n\nYou can use Electrum as a hot wallet for everyday Bitcoin transactions, but the wallet has also integrated support for hardware wallets from manufacturers such as Ledger and Trezor if you want to use it to manage more substantial transactions.\n\nA great thing about the Electrum wallet is that it connects to a decentralized server network, which means you\u2019re not very likely to experience any issues with downtime. While it is a very solid wallet, Electrum is limited to Bitcoin, so you should look for alternatives if you also want to store other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGet Electrum Wallet\n\n6.
