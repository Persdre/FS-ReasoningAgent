        "title": "SEC approval of Ether ETFs acknowledges Ether is a commodity - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight spot Ether ETFs in a bulk order. However, there is another formality before they can be sold to the public, which may take a few months. A key aspect of the order is that each ETF is considered a \u2018Commodity-Based Trust Share\u2019. Several years ago the SEC classified Ether as a commodity, but that changed over a year ago without any announcement. It concluded that Ether had become a security following the migration to Ethereum 2.0, which adopted Proof of Stake. This came to light due to Ethereum development house Consensys suing the SEC over claims that Ether is a security.\n\nTherefore, the ETF\u2019s recognition of Ether as a commodity marks a significant reversal. There\u2019s considerable debate about the reason for the abrupt shift. With Congress passing the FIT 21 crypto Bill this week with the backing of many Democrats, the politics around crypto is shifting. That\u2019s particularly in the run up to an election where the Biden administration\u2019s crypto stance might be viewed as a potential vote loser.\n\nInterestingly, the SEC Commissioners did not directly vote on the ETFs, unlike the Bitcoin ETFs. Instead, they delegated the authority to the Division of Trading and Markets. While delegation is a common practice, it\u2019s notable that this decision would not have been made without the majority of the Commissioners\u2019 approval, as highlighted by Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart.\n\nThe eight ETFs are from Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock\u2019s iShares, VanEck, ARK 21shares, Invesco Galaxy, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.\n\nConsensys to continue its fight\n\nMeanwhile, Consensys has vowed to continue with its litigation against the SEC. \u201cToday\u2019s approval signals that the SEC views that ETH is a commodity and not a security \u2013 contrary to the position it continued to take prior to the events of this week, as described in our recent lawsuit against the SEC,\u201d the company wrote on X. \u201cWe will continue to fight for definitive regulatory clarity in our case.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cthis seemingly last minute approval is yet another example of the SEC\u2019s troublesome ad hoc approach to digital assets.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the crypto community that\u2019s been unhappy with the SEC. Both Congress and the Senate voted in favor of a resolution to overturn an SEC accounting bulletin (SAB 121) that effectively blocks banks from providing digital asset custody. It is the first digital assets-related law passed by both legislative branches, yet another sign of the changing political tide. However, the White House has vowed to veto it."

        "title": "How To Short Ether - Investopedia",
        "content": "Short Selling Ethereum\n\nShort selling Ethereum (ETH) involves borrowing ether and immediately selling it, with the plan to buy it back when prices drop. This strategy is used by traders with a bearish outlook on the market to take advantage of declining prices.\n\nA successful short provides a profit of the difference between the sale and repurchase price, less any fees. But it's a strategy that offers the potential for unlimited losses. ETH is a notoriously volatile asset, and losses can mount quickly. To cite an example, on May 21, 2024, the price of ETH spiked 22% in 24 hours on news of a potential ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF), causing over $280 million in losses marketwide on short selling.\n\nBelow, we take you through several ways to short the cryptocurrency.\n\nKey Takeways Short selling ether is borrowing ETH, selling it, and repurchasing it after prices drop.\n\nShort selling ether generally requires a margin account on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nShorting ETH allows traders to potentially profit when the price falls. This can be a way to hedge other crypto holdings or capitalize on bearish market sentiment.\n\nWhile it offers the potential for high rewards, shorting ETH carries the risk of unlimited losses.\n\nTraders can use alternative strategies instead of short selling ether, such as buying short ether ETFs.\n\nHow Shorting Ethereum Works\n\nShort selling refers to when an investor borrows an asset\u2014in this case, ETH\u2014and sells it on the open market, planning to repurchase it later for less. The exchanges that allow you to short ETH often require you to hold a margin account. These accounts allow you to borrow money to buy assets, in this case, ETH. What's borrowed, called \"margin,\" is often used to augment your buying power and potentially amplify your gains.\n\nIn May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX the approval to list Ether Spot ETFs. These instruments are similar to the Bitcoin Spot ETFs approved earlier in the year.\n\nSimilar to shorting a regular ETF, once the SEC approves an ETH ETF, you can borrow shares from the broker, sell them immediately, buy them back when prices fall, and then return the shares.\n\nSuppose you think ETH is due to drop in price soon, and you have $10,000 in your margin account, which allows you to trade up to twice what you have in the account. The price of ETH on crypto exchanges is about $4,000. Here are the steps:\n\nBorrow on margin: You decide to use the maximum leverage allowed and borrow an additional $10,000 from your broker, giving you $20,000 to trade. Shorting ETH: You use the entire $20,000 to short sell five ETH. This means you're selling five ETH you've borrowed from the broker, expecting to buy them back later at a lower price. Price drop: As you predicted, the price of ETH plummets to $3,000. Close the position: You buy back five ETH at the new, lower price of $3,000, spending a total of $15,000. Profit time: You return the five borrowed ETH to the broker and walk away with a $5,000 profit (minus any fees or interest).\n\nUsing ETH Futures ETFs\n\nEther futures ETFs began trading in October 2023. If you have a margin account that allows short selling, you can sell short one or more of these Ether ETFs to profit from falling ETH prices.\n\nIf you don't have the desire to sell ETH futures ETF shares short, another option is to purchase a short cryptocurrency ETF, like the Proshares Short Ether Strategy ETF (SETH). This ETF attempts to return the inverse of the Bloomberg Galaxy Ethereum Index."

The listing follows the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of eight spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF on DTCC\n\nThe SEC filings list eight Ethereum ETFs from VanEck, Fidelity, Franklin, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Invesco & Galaxy, and BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust, proposed for listing on Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and the Cboe BZX Exchange, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nAlthough the SEC has approved the 19b-4 forms associated with these ETFs, trading will remain on hold until the SEC approves each ETF\u2019s S-1 filing. The timeline for this approval process varies, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to several months.\n\n\u201cThis does not mean they will begin trading tomorrow. This is just 19b-4 approval. Also needs to be an approval on the S-1 documents which is going to take time. We\u2019re expecting it to take a couple weeks but could take longer,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared.\n\nThe SEC has reportedly begun discussions with ETF issuers regarding S-1 forms. Seyffart suggests that the SEC\u2019s approval of the S-1 filings could take up to five months, after which trading of the spot Ethereum ETFs can commence.\n\n\u201cTypically this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples but [Eric Balchunas] and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated,\u201d he added.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the recent approval.\n\nBriefly after the approval, asset manager VanEck submitted the amended S-1 form to the SEC. The firm also released a 37-second advertisement to celebrate the landmark approval, inviting viewers to \u201cEnter the ether.\u201d"

Base, the L2 that was incubated by dominant U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, took second place with nearly 815,000 addresses.\n\nThe base layer of Ethereum, in contrast, had 2.1 million active addresses.\n\nThe rollup-centric roadmap entails a shift of activity from Ethereum\u2019s base layer to its layer 2 networks. \u201cCurrently, users have accounts on L1, ENS names on L1, applications live entirely on L1, etc. All of this is going to have to change,\u201d wrote Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in Oct. 2020. \u201cWe would need to adapt to a world where users have their primary accounts, balances, assets, etc entirely inside an L2.\u201d\n\nThe sustained growth of addresses interacting with layer 2 networks highlight the ongoing improvements in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s scalability, or ability to handle more transactions.\n\nRead More: \u200b\u200bWhy ETH Isn\u2019t Moving Higher After SEC Approves Key Filings for Spot ETFs\n\nThe number of distinct addresses on Ethereum L2s hit the new record high before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the 19b-4s filings of several spot ether exchange-traded funds yesterday. While the move is a step closer to the rollout of ETFs directly investing in ETH, the native gas token for the Ethereum blockchain, trading of spot ETH ETFs still awaits a further SEC approval.\n\nThe SEC has to approve S-1 forms, registration documents needed for a firm to offer shares of an ETF to the public.\n\nThe price of ETH has rallied about 20% in the past seven days but has decreased 2.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3,720 at the time of writing, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Remains Flat Following Historic Spot ETF Approval\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced relatively minor price movements, gaining 0.80% over the past 24 hours, following the surprising approval of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). After the news of the ETF approvals broke, Ethereum's price briefly surged to $3,935, according to CoinMarketCap data, before settling down at $3,794. Although Ethereum has experienced a 28% surge in the last week, it remains 22% below its all-time high of $4,878, reached in November 2021.\n\nThe sudden approval of these ETFs by the SEC represents a momentous decision that paves the way for Ethereum trading to take place on Wall Street. The approved funds include the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK/21 Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe availability of these ETFs allows everyday investors to purchase shares that trade on stock exchanges and track the price movements of Ethereum. This simplifies the process of buying, selling, and storing Ethereum for traditional investors who may find the world of digital coins and tokens daunting. ETFs are widely recognized and regulated investment vehicles that provide an accessible entry point into the crypto space without requiring extensive technical knowledge.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs marks a significant turn of events, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been silent on the matter for several months, leading many industry experts and analysts to anticipate a rejection. In a similar turn of events earlier this year, the SEC reluctantly approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, leading to a surge in the price of the largest cryptocurrency to all-time highs of $73,750."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, a cryptocurrency linked to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is marching past its previous all-time highs\u2014and the CEO of a BlackRock-backed RWA firm tells Decrypt that the approval is bullish for the premise of tokenizing assets on Ethereum.\n\nOndo Finance\u2019s governance token has surged 16% to $1.10 over the past 24 hours\u2014leading the crypto market\u2019s top 100 coins by market cap in terms of daily gains, as of this writing, per CoinGecko.\n\nThe project specializes in offering institutional-grade financial products and services, such as tokens offering U.S. dollar yield or exposure to U.S. Treasuries. In 2022, Pantera Capital and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund led a $20 million Series A funding round in the project.\n\nApparently affirming Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status as a commodity, the approval of several spot ETFs has massive consequences for firms focused on building digital representations of assets that trade on-chain and via associated infrastructure, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe most important thing here is not that you can trade an Ethereum ETF,\u201d he said of Thursday\u2019s approvals. \u201cEthereum, at least from an institutional perspective, is [now] completely safe to use because there\u2019s no risk that the gas token, ETH in this case, is actually a security.\u201d\n\nIn March, Ondo said it would move $95 million worth of funds backing its U.S. Treasury-backed token (OUSG) to BlackRock\u2019s tokenized BUIDL fund. Established through Securitize, shares of BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund are represented by an Ethereum-based token, pegged to the price of $1, and subscribers of the fund receive a yield through the form of more tokens.\n\nFun fact of the day\ud83d\udc47$ONDO alone has contributed $195M of BUIDL's $448M AUM. To put this into perspective.. Blackrock's first onchain fund, has seen nearly 50% of its growth come from Ondo's efforts. There's levels to this and your size isn't size. \u2014 JTrades\u2694\ufe0f (@_JTrades_) May 24, 2024\n\nOndo\u2019s shift to BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund was all about efficiency, Domingo said. The CEO explained that previously, while backing its OUSG token with BlackRock's iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, managing the product was comparatively clunky.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey didn't have good control over the underlying asset in terms of fast issuance, fast redemption, [and] on chain visibility\u2014that the money's there,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cOne of the use cases for BUIDL is that it becomes a base layer for people to build products on top of it.\u201d\n\nOndo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has highlighted tokenization as the \u201cnext generation for markets\u201d since 2022, believing that crypto tech could provide financial market participants \u201creduced fees\u201d and \u201cinstantaneous settlement.\u201d\n\nDescribing Ondo as \u201cvery innovative,\u201d Domingo said Ondo\u2019s use of BUIDL collapses five distinct steps\u2014between broker-dealers and custodians that safeguard assets\u2014in the redemption of Ondo\u2019s products. Before, he said, it would take them \u201ctwo or three days to get the money.\u201d\n\nIn light of the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, Domingo said he expects more staid financial firms to branch into the tokenization space with a cloud of regulatory jitters recently dispelled.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, [this] is more relevant for tokenization than the Bitcoin ETF,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I mentioned, it makes very clear that [Ethereum is] not a commodity, and therefore, using the public Ethereum blockchain is safe from a regulatory perspective.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Why staking was removed from Ethereum ETFs to get SEC approval - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The removal of staking from Ethereum ETFs has been driven by regulatory pressures from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issuers amended their ETF filings to exclude staking provisions prior to the approvals on May 23. This strategic shift aims to align with the SEC\u2019s regulatory expectations to allow the approval for their Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIs staked ETH a security?\n\nStaking, which involves locking up crypto to validate transactions in exchange for rewards, is a significant feature of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. However, the SEC views staking services as potentially constituting unregistered securities offerings. This perspective has led to actions against major crypto platforms like Coinbase and Kraken for offering staking services and alleging violations of federal securities laws. Consequently, ETF issuers removed staking from their proposals to avoid similar legal challenges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s classification of staked ETH as a security hinges on applying the Howey Test, which determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract. According to the SEC, staking involves investing money when users lock up their ETH in exchange for potential returns, satisfying the first prong of the Howey Test. The second prong, a joint enterprise, is met as stakers contribute to a shared ecosystem and rely on the collective efforts of network validators and developers to secure and maintain the network. The third prong, the expectation of profits, is fulfilled as stakers anticipate rewards in additional tokens. Finally, the SEC argues that these profits are derived primarily from the efforts of others, such as the validators and developers who ensure the network\u2019s functionality and security. This interpretation aligns staking with the characteristics of an investment contract, thereby subjecting it to securities regulations.\n\nWhy staked ETH is not a security\n\nOpponents contend that staking should not be classified as a security because it fundamentally differs from traditional investment contracts. Staking involves locking up tokens to support network operations and earn rewards, which is more akin to a technical service than an investment scheme. The rewards from staking are derived from the network\u2019s protocol and market conditions, not from the managerial efforts of a third party, which challenges the application of the Howey Test\u2019s \u201cefforts of others\u201d prong.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s enforcement actions against staking services, such as those involving Kraken and Coinbase, have been criticized for lacking clear guidance and creating a climate of regulatory uncertainty. Critics argue that the SEC\u2019s reliance on enforcement rather than providing explicit regulatory frameworks leaves crypto firms and investors in a precarious position, unsure of how to comply with the law. This approach is considered inefficient and unfair, particularly in an emerging industry that requires clear and consistent regulations to foster growth and innovation.\n\nMoreover, the decentralized nature of many staking activities complicates the SEC\u2019s assertion that stakers primarily rely on the efforts of others. In decentralized networks, validators and stakers operate independently, and the network\u2019s security and functionality are maintained through a collective effort rather than centralized management. This decentralization challenges the notion that staking constitutes a joint enterprise under the Howey Test.\n\nAdditionally, critics argue that the SEC\u2019s actions could drive staking activities offshore, reducing the United States\u2019 influence in the global crypto market and potentially compromising investor protection. By pushing staking services to jurisdictions with more favorable regulations, the SEC may inadvertently encourage less oversight and more significant risks for US investors.\n\nFinally, the SEC\u2019s stance may hinder blockchain technology\u2019s broader adoption and development. Staking is a crucial component of proof-of-stake networks, designed to be more energy-efficient than their proof-of-work counterparts. By imposing stringent regulations on staking, the SEC could limit the potential benefits of DeFi and other blockchain-based innovations.\n\nStaked ETH and Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval process for Ethereum ETFs involves submitting 19b-4 forms for listing on exchanges and S-1 forms detailing fund management. While the SEC has approved the 19b-4 forms, the S-1 forms are still under review. The exclusion of staking from these filings is necessary to meet the SEC\u2019s regulatory requirements and facilitate the approval process.\n\nThe removal of staking from Ethereum ETFs has sparked debate within the crypto community. Many investors highly value staking for the yield it generates, and its absence in Ethereum ETFs could significantly diminish its attractiveness compared to direct purchases of Ethereum, where invhttp://stakingestors can engage in staking activities. Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at GSR, highlighted the \u201cimmediate opportunity cost\u201d of holding Ether in an ETF that does not offer staking.\n\nDespite these concerns, the potential benefits of the Ethereum blockchain remain a topic of interest. Eliminating staking from ETFs could lead to broader implications for supply, network security, and decentralization due to less staked ETH.\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is considering allowing staking for Ethereum ETFs. This approach aims to enhance the attractiveness of these ETFs by offering passive income opportunities through staking, potentially boosting investor interest and supporting Hong Kong\u2019s ambitions to become a global crypto hub.\n\nUltimately, the removal of staking from Ethereum ETFs directly responds to the SEC\u2019s regulatory concerns and legal actions against staking services. This strategic adjustment by ETF issuers aims to align with regulatory expectations and get approval despite potentially reducing the attractiveness of these ETFs compared to direct Ethereum investments.\n\nWill staking be enabled further down the line? Time will tell, and all eyes will be on the SEC and its decision to classify Ethereum and staked ETH in the coming weeks and months."

        "content": "Mounting excitement around the approval of spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) comes with a caveat: the issuers will likely not offer staking as part of the ETF, which could be beneficial to ETF stakers and Ethereum overall.\n\nRead more: ETH ETFs Will Be Approved. But Could Grayscale Outflows Depress the Price of ETH?\n\nETF applicants like Fidelity and BlackRock have decided to exclude staking in their filings, implying what the industry already sensed: the SEC is not willing to allow ETF issuers to include staking in their products.\n\nMatt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise (which will issue an ETH spot ETF), said on Unchained that he would have expected the SEC to go this route. \u201cThe first shot on goal will be let\u2019s get to 90%, which is without staking and then let\u2019s worry about the complications later and down the road,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: After ETH, Which Crypto ETF Will Be Approved Next?\n\nETFs With No Staking Mean More Returns for Stakers\n\nWith the likely exclusion of staking from ETH ETFs, investors who buy these ETFs will miss out on staking rewards, currently around 3% APY, depending on the provider, per Staking Rewards data. These rewards, instead, will go to those who stake their ETH directly or with staking services such as Lido or Rocket Pool.\n\nRead more: Could the SEC Have a Case Against Liquid Staking Protocols?\n\nThis setup would amount to a transfer of value from non-staking ETF holders to direct stakers. Staking rewards are a significant component of the potential returns from holding ETH, and by not participating in staking, ETF investors are effectively being diluted, as is every holder of vanilla ETH. This value transfer benefits those who engage in staking, enhancing their returns at the expense of non-stakers.\n\nFidelity is the only ETF issuer that has so far clearly stated in its filing that \u201cNeither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Custodian, nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust\u2019s ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings.\u201d However, it is expected that none of the issuers will engage in such activities given the regulatory uncertainty.\n\nIf they did, they would have \u201cthe most profitable ETF in the world to run,\u201d according to Global Macro Investor CEO Raoul Pal.\n\nRead more: \u200b\u200bWhy ETH Isn\u2019t Moving Higher After SEC Approves Key Filings for Spot ETFs\n\nETFs Could Mitigate Staking Ratio Concerns\n\nThe exclusion of staking from these ETFs could also alleviate a growing concern in the Ethereum community about the rapidly increasing ratio of staked ETH. High staking ratios have raised fears of centralization and reduced liquidity. By not incorporating staking, these ETFs will likely help maintain a more balanced ratio of staked to non-staked ETH by sucking up ETH liquidity.\n\nAs Ethereum researchers have pointed out\n\n, a high staking ratio can lead to centralization risks and inflationary pressures on non-stakers. Because the ETFs will effectively lock up large sums of ETH that are not staked, they may help mitigate these risks, ensuring a healthier balance within the network and addressing community apprehensions about an excessive amount of ETH being locked in staking contracts.\n\nRead more: Why the Ethereum Community Is Up in Arms Against a Proposal to Change the Monetary Policy\n\nHowever, this will depend on the SEC never approving staking to be offered as a part of spot ETH ETFs. Given the fast-moving nature of crypto politics in Washington, that\u2019s difficult to predict with any confidence."

Fish specifically called out connections to EigenLayer, a protocol for re-staking Ether to secure Ethereum layer 2 blockchains, which now holds $18.1 billion in TVL, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nDays later, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake confirmed that he\u2019d established a multimillion-dollar advisory relationship with EigenLayer, for which he\u2019s received \u201ca significant EIGEN token incentive\u201d worth millions of dollars, comprising close to half of his net worth.\n\nFellow researcher Dankrad Feist also confirmed a similar relationship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnline critics have worried that accepting money from EigenLayer could influence the experts\u2019 analyses of re-staking risks (which trended cautious) or possibly influence his work on the core Ethereum protocol.\n\nIs an Ethereum core dev working for EigenLayer the same thing as the US Secretary of Defense working for the largest private defense company?

        "title": "Ethereum spot ETF approval is here - Everything you need to know - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "SEC's analysis confirms strong link between Ethereum futures and spot markets.\n\nShare this article\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs have finally received the greenlight after a period of uncertainty. Thursday\u2019s approval not only marked a milestone for Ethereum but also a positive development in the US regulatory approach to crypto. This article will provide more insights into the recent approval, its potential motivation, and implications for the industry.\n\nAn overview of spot Ethereum ETF approval\n\nOn May 23, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the 19b-4 forms associated with eight spot Ethereum ETFs. These include Blackrock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, Franklin Ethereum ETF, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe latest approval follows the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January. However, unlike Bitcoin ETFs, the Ethereum products still need S-1 form approval to fully operate, which is pending review now.\n\nAs reported by Crypto Briefing, the securities watchdog recently started engaging with ETF issuers on S-1 forms. This development likewise confirmed some previous speculation that the SEC lacked interaction with the issuers during the review process.\n\nConsidering previous cases, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart estimates that it may take the SEC up to five months to clear the spot Ethereum funds for trading. However, the analyst suggests that the timeline can be extended.\n\nKey factors influencing approval\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s approval document, the correlation between Ethereum futures and spot markets was one of the key factors influencing the decision.\n\nNotably, the SEC conducted its own analysis to verify the correlation results provided by Bitwise\u2019s amendments and other commenters, including the Coinbase Letter and CF Benchmarks Letters. The SEC\u2019s findings confirmed the high correlations reported, indicating a robust linkage between the CME Ethereum futures and spot Ethereum markets.\n\nOther considerations addressed in the approval document include investor protection, market integrity, volatility, and risk concerns.\n\nHowever, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, claimed that the SEC might \u201cexplicitly avoid staking\u201d in its document.\n\nThere have been ongoing discussions surrounding the SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum\u2019s staking feature. Analysts believe that the removal of the staking component, or the affirmation of no staking in Ethereum ETF filings is as important as other key factors influencing the decision.\n\nMajor firms such as Fidelity and ARK 21Shares initially included staking provisions in their filings with the SEC. However, ahead of the SEC\u2019s decision deadline, these firms amended their filings to eliminate any references to staking.\n\nWhile there have been no further comments from the ETF issuers, these removals were likely in response to the SEC\u2019s stance that staking services could be viewed as unregistered securities offerings.\n\nHistorically, the SEC has demonstrated a cautious approach to staking services.\n\nFor instance, the SEC alleged that Kraken\u2019s staking program, where users deposit crypto assets to stake and earn rewards, was an unregistered securities offering in violation of US securities laws. The lawsuit ended with Kraken\u2019s $30 million settlement with the SEC. The firm subsequently discontinued its staking service for US retail customers.\n\nAnother case is the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023. The agency also alleged that Coinbase\u2019s retail staking services were securities.\n\nWhy does Ethereum ETF approval matter?\n\nThe SEC\u2019s green light for spot Ethereum ETFs hints at, but doesn\u2019t definitively confirm, their stance on the underlying asset, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nRumors have swirled that the SEC considers most cryptos, except Bitcoin, to be unregistered securities. This aligns with statements from SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the recent ETF approval offers a potential counterpoint.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, and Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, interpret the recent approval as an implicit nod to ETH\u2019s status as a commodity, given that the ETF shares are based on a commodity.\n\n\u201cThis week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I\u2019ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we\u2019ve always known it to be,\u201d Grewal stated.\n\n\u201c\u2026it\u2019s clear: \u201ccommodity-based trust shares,\u201d Chervinsky noted.\n\nWhy might delegated authority not matter?\n\nThe approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs was issued via delegated authority, which eliminates the need for public commissioner votes. This arrangement raises concerns because it allows any commissioner the technical right to challenge and request a review of the decision.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said a review request would likely not alter the outcome.\n\nAccording to him, the SEC commissioners would not permit the Trading and Markets division to issue such an approval unless a majority of them supported the decision. This consensus among the commissioners suggests a strong foundational agreement on the approval.\n\nI say \"it wouldn't change anything\" because the SEC commissioners would not have allowed Trading and Markets division to write/issue this approval order via delegated authority unless a plurality of the commissioners agreed on that decision \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 23, 2024\n\nIn essence, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs under delegated authority indicates that the launch of these ETFs is imminent.\n\nThe possibility of enforcement action against Ethereum-linked entities\n\nThe recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs came as a welcome surprise, especially given the SEC\u2019s alleged legal threats against Ethereum-associated entities such as the Ethereum Foundation and Consensys.\n\nThe agency had reportedly initiated a campaign to classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security\u2014a move many believed would undermine the prospects for approving Ethereum-based ETFs.\n\nThis backdrop, combined with a lack of engagement reported by insiders and a generally pessimistic outlook from ETF issuers and experts, made the favorable decision on May 23 particularly unexpected.\n\nExperts had speculated that the SEC was reluctant to approve ETFs tied to ETH because it wanted to classify the crypto as a security. However, the prevailing political climate in the US appears to have influenced the SEC to alter its stance and approve these ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, this approval does not mean that the entities involved are completely off the hook. The SEC might still treat the sale of ETH tokens during Ethereum\u2019s 2014 ICO as an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d\n\nIf this is the case, it likely reflects the Ripple-SEC legal lawsuit, in which the SEC alleged that the sale of XRP between 2013 and 2020 represented an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d\n\nAccording to a court ruling last year, XRP sales on the secondary market did not constitute an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d but the institutional sales were deemed unregistered offers and sales of investment contracts under the Howey test.\n\nApart from these possibilities, in a less likely scenario, the SEC might not intend to sue the entities.\n\nThe recent legal threats, including one targeting Uniswap, might be a strategy to intimidate or pressure crypto companies, rather than a genuine reflection of wrongdoing. This view was previously supported by Chervinsky.\n\nThe SEC just sent a Wells notice to Robinhood. The number they've sent about crypto in recent months is astonishing. It's hard to imagine that they would (or could) bring so many enforcement actions at once. It seems like they're abusing the Wells process as a scare tactic now. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) May 6, 2024"

        "content": "SEC Renders Decision on Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday approved a rule change that sets up proposed spot Ethereum ETFs for final approval.\n\nThe SEC must still approve the S-1 registration statements, but observers of the process have said such approvals are generally a formality.\n\nThe announcement on Thursday on the agency's website seemed unlikely barely a week ago and underscores the growing demand for cryptocurrency-based investments.\n\nThe decision affects funds proposed by VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Ark 21 Shares, Grayscale.

The second largest digital asset behind bitcoin in market capitalization has risen more than 30% over the past week with much of the gains coming after the SEC signaled a willingness to approve the rules change. In the days before Thursday's announcement, the agency asked issuers to amend the 19b-4 forms to address concerns about investor protections and regulatory oversight.\n\nThe updated applications have eliminated staking rewards, a high-risk strategy in which investors use ether as collateral to validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nVanEck, Ark 21/Shares September Filings\n\nVanEck and Ark/21 Shares filed their spot Ethereum proposals on Sept. 6. Seven other issuers filed their applications in the ensuring seven months, including Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity, whose slightly more than four-month-old spot bitcoin funds are the largest by assets under management. The 11 spot bitcoin funds have generated about $13 billion in inflows.\n\nDespite the spot bitcoin funds' success, investors and analysts doubted that the SEC would greenlight VanEck's and other spot ether-based funds\u2014at least any time soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe agency had been concerned that spot Ethereum ETFs are vulnerable to market manipulation and fraud, which agency Chairman Gary Gensler has argued plage digital assets, and which presented an obstacle to spot bitcoin approvals. But amid robust demand and shifting political winds that have seen once crypto-shy Democrats join Republicans in support of digital asset-related investments, the SEC seemed to become more receptive to the products based on ether's price.\n\nGrayscale praised the decision in a statement.\n\n\"At Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to engage constructively with regulators as they review spot Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential of bringing Ethereum further into the US regulatory perimeter in the ETF wrapper,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nBut in a note to etf.com, Peter Eberle, president and chief investment officer of Lafayette, Calif.-based digital asset fund manager Castle Funds, wrote that he was \"surprised\" by the SEC decision and was uncertain about investor interest in the products.\n\n\"As a long-term investor in ETH, we stake our ETH, which earns us about 3%,\" he wrote. \"These ETF\u2019s will not be allowed to stake.\"\n\nHe added: \"I also don\u2019t believe that institutional investors need to add ETH to their portfolio since it is highly correlated to BTC. If they allocate 1-3% to crypto, do they really need both BTC and ETH? I am bullish on ETH despite my skepticism of ETH ETFS.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "title": "Buterin's Ethereum Transfer Sparks Crypto Frenzy: $300K Surge For Privacy Shield - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, cofounder of Ethereum, made a notable move in the cryptocurrency space today by transferring 80 ETH, valued at approximately $300,000, to the privacy-focused coin mixer Railgun. This transaction marks the latest in a series of monthly transfers Buterin has made to Railgun over the past six months.\n\nRailgun, renowned within the crypto community for its robust privacy protocols, offers coin mixing services designed to protect user anonymity and prevent malicious activities. Buterin has been an outspoken advocate for Railgun\u2019s privacy pools protocol, which he argues significantly bolsters user privacy by complicating efforts to trace transactions back to their origin. \u201cPrivacy is normal,\u201d Buterin has previously stated, underscoring the critical role of privacy in cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThe privacy pools protocol employed by Railgun uses advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transactional anonymity, addressing mounting concerns about privacy breaches in the crypto ecosystem. This innovative approach has made Railgun a favored platform for users seeking heightened security and confidentiality in their crypto dealings.\n\nEthereum Navigates Privacy Imperatives\n\nButerin\u2019s consistent use of Railgun reflects a broader industry trend towards prioritizing privacy in cryptocurrency transactions. As regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies intensifies globally, platforms like Railgun, which emphasize privacy, are increasingly viewed as essential for maintaining transactional confidentiality while complying with regulatory requirements. This trend is particularly significant for Ethereum, which continues to see growing adoption and an evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nThe timing of Buterin\u2019s latest transfer coincides with a bullish phase for Ethereum\u2019s market performance. Recent data shows ETH trading at $3,740, a 2.06% increase over the past 24 hours and a significant 29% rise over the past week. This surge in Ethereum\u2019s price is fueled by community anticipation around potential approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nButerin\u2019s strategic move underscores the importance of privacy-focused solutions like Railgun in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum continues to gain traction and regulatory landscapes shift, the role of platforms like Railgun in safeguarding user privacy is set to become increasingly vital."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s powerful new \u2018EigenLayer\u2019 promises a wave of innovation. But is it a threat to the blockchain? - Fortune",
        "content": "Ethereum has spent the current bull market living in the shadow of Bitcoin, but two recent developments could thrust the world\u2019s second-biggest blockchain back into the spotlight. The first is the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s surprise move to greenlight Ethereum ETFs. The second is a popular but divisive new investing feature called EigenLayer, which has received $100 million in backing from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Crypto.\n\nEigenLayer is a new protocol, or set of instructions, that sits atop the main Ethereum blockchain. It offers a way for those who have already invested tokens by means of staking\u2014a blockchain feature that rewards those who lock up their tokens to secure the network\u2014the ability to \u201crestake\u201d those tokens. The term is what it sounds like. By restaking, users take Ethereum tokens they have already invested and then invest them again. But instead of receiving a reward from the Ethereum network, as happens with staking, those who restake get paid by other projects piggybacking off the blockchain\u2019s existing security pool.\n\nRestaking has existed for some time but EigenLayer is seeking to turbocharge the process by adding a lot more participants. The protocol aspires to be something akin to an Amazon Web Services for cryptoeconomic security.\n\nThe implications of this are \u201cprofound,\u201d a16z wrote in a blog post about the company, noting that EigenLayer has the potential to accelerate innovation on Ethereum \u201c100x faster.\u201d While this appears to be a promising development for the blockchain, EigenLayer has yet to be tested at scale. And while it could result in a burst of innovation for Ethereum, some point to a major potential drawback: a new concentration of risk that, in a worst-case scenario, could harm both users and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Should Ethereum users view EigenLayer with excitement, fear, or both?\n\n\u2018Opens up a wormhole\u2019\n\nThe arrival of EigenLayer is a boon both to investors, who can now more easily earn an additional slice of yield, and for developers who can more quickly add a trust layer in the form of collateral. The issue, however, is that using the same pool of collateral to secure multiple aspects of the blockchain creates new vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt opens up a wormhole,\u201d Rushi Manche, cofounder of Ethereum layer 2 Movement Labs, told Fortune. Manche raised a troubling hypothetical posed by EigenLayer critics: What happens if there\u2019s a hack or a bug in the restaking smart contract? How does that affect the wider ecosystem which is also relying on this single deposit?\n\nAt the same time, Manche noted that proponents say \u201can entire new design space has opened up\u201d for developers thanks to EigenLayer, allowing the same asset to be stretched much further and achieve much more. From this view, the rewards far outweigh the risk. It\u2019s also worth considering the drawbacks if tools like EigenLayer are not available.\n\nSpecifically, in the absence of restaking, decentralized applications built on top of Ethereum must create their own proof-of-stake token\u2014a high bar of entry for any startup. With restaking, protocols can dip into the main blockchain\u2019s almost $95 billion of staked Ether for security. To revisit the cloud computing analogy: If hackers want to attack small businesses, they have to get past the likes of Google Cloud or AWS on which those businesses rely. EigenLayer proponents make the same case: Hackers need to get past a security system created by Ethereum, which has worth more than triple the market cap of Nike.\n\nBut, what happens when the same collateral gets reused again and again?\n\n\u201cEigenLayer reminds me of the 2008 recession: undercollateralize, overleverage. That\u2019ll go well,\u201d one X user posted\u2014just one of the industry onlookers who have drawn parallels with the financial crash, where banks rehypothecated subprime mortgage loans.\n\nAustin Campbell, the former head of portfolio management at Paxos, told Fortune that the comparison isn\u2019t trivial. \u201cAt the core of every levered system is the simple truth that the more leverage you use, the less stable your system is,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is a risk of \u201ccascading failures\u201d if one project fails, agrees Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. But he and many experts were also quick to offer nuance to the 2008 parallels: Restaking doesn\u2019t involve rinse-and-repeat borrowing and lending. Instead, it\u2019s taking a locked-up asset, and locking it up again. Think of it more like reusing the security deposit on an apartment to secure further apartments, suggests Jack O\u2019Holleran, CEO of Skale, an Ethereum layer 2.\n\nBut then what if you trash both apartments?\n\nOne scenario of so-called apartment trashing would be if those operating the restaking services\u2014known as AVS for \u201cactively validated services\u201d\u2014choose to devalue the restaked tokens. \u201cThere could be this \u2018house of cards\u2019 effect, but backwards,\u201d says O\u2019Holleran.\n\nThe debate is analogous to the criticism of liquid staking provider Lido, which currently accounts for 28% of all Ethereum being staked. In theory, Lido introduces a \u201ccentralized point of failure\u201d which is \u201cobviously concerning,\u201d Tekin Salimi, founder of dao5 Capital and seed investor in EigenLater, told Fortune. But in his view, rather than barring this innovation, diversifying the liquid staking providers is the solution.\n\nNoting these concerns, EigenLayer says on its website that it includes a \u201cveto committee\u201d to contain slashing\u2014the term used in the Ethereum world for destroying the collateral of validators who fail to fulfill their duties\u2014and to prevent contagion to the mainnet or other protocols. It will serve as a \u201cdoubly-trusted intermediary between AVS and staker.\u201d So, slashing conditions fall to each AVS, instead of the overall protocol\u2019s discretion. But what this will really look like in practice, is unclear. To that effect, slashing risks remain \u201cthe most real and yet the most undefined\u201d of all those raised, thinks Vance Spencer, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t overload the system\u2019 Ethereum founder warns\n\nEigenLayer has given rise to specific security concerns, but also to a more broader existential one: What fraction of staked tokens can be concentrated on a separate protocol on Ethereum, which holds up decentralization as its paramount value? According to O\u2019Holleran, empowering EigenLayer amounts to the Ethereum community giving considerable leverage and power to another system. Furthermore, copycat restaking services are also popping up, such as Karak, which announced a $48 million Series A raise last month. In addition, an unnamed but similar version is soon coming to market, sources close to the matter told Fortune.\n\nVitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s founder, raised concerns about EigenLayer in a blog post last May. \u201cBe wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the \u201cscope\u201d of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,\u201d he wrote. Buterin warns of the \u201cslippery slope\u201d of the underlying network\u2019s \u201cfragile\u201d social consensus losing credibility. His message was clear: Don\u2019t overload the network\u2019s consensus.\n\nOne of the concentration risks of top concern to Buterin is overloading the system\u2019s security.\n\nThe strength of Ethereum\u2019s security system is directly correlated to the economic value of the network\u2014it would be prohibitively expensive for hackers to muster the resources to defeat the consensus system that protects the network. \u201cWe agree that Ether is being used to secure the main net network, and that is the only purpose thereof,\u201d says Campbell. But if you are using your staked tokens to secure Ethereum and other networks, then the surface of things that Ether is being used to secure grows. So, the value resting on any single point gets larger, explains Campbell, which may provide more attractive incentives for hackers.\n\nThe second concentration risk concerns decision-making. Let\u2019s say 40% of Ethereum\u2019s tokens eventually becomes restaked and EigenLayer\u2019s smart contract experiences a hack or bug. It\u2019s unclear when there would be consensus to rollback Ethereum to release it, explains Tom Schmidt, partner at crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that threshold is,\u201d he admits."

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation considering formal conflict of interest policy after community backlash - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum Foundation (EF) is considering implementing a formal conflict of interest policy following backlash over two prominent developers joining EigenLayer as advisors.\n\nExecutive director Aya Miyaguchi addressed the issue in a social media post, emphasizing the importance of maintaining credible neutrality within the organization. She said the foundation shares the community\u2019s concerns and is committed to maintaining trust.\n\nMiyaguchi said:\n\n\u201cIt is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment has not been sufficient, and we have been working on a formal policy to address this problem for a while now. We will be accelerating this work and will share an update soon.\u201d\n\nControversy\n\nThe controversy began on May 18 when prominent crypto trader Jordan Fish, known as Cobie, publicly questioned Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin about the ethics of EF developers receiving significant financial incentives from projects built on the network.\n\nCobie\u2019s tweet specifically used EigenLayer as an example and sparked widespread discussion on social media about potential conflicts of interest. He wrote:\n\n\u201cHow do you feel about Ethereum Foundation core developers or researchers taking life-changing packages from projects built on Ethereum to become \u2018advisors,\u2019 when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future? For example \u2014 purely theoretically, of course \u2014 let\u2019s say, EigenLayer.\u201d\n\nFollowing Cobie\u2019s tweet, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake disclosed his advisory role at EigenLayer on May 19. Drake revealed that he received a substantial incentive in Eigen tokens, estimated to be worth millions of dollars over a three-year vesting period.\n\nThe disclosure heightened concerns about transparency and potential conflicts of interest between EigenLayer and the Ethereum Foundation. Drake also stated that the information had been public since May 3, and the timing of the disclosure with Cobie\u2019s tweet was a coincidence.\n\nOn May 21, another Ethereum Foundation researcher, Dankrad Feist, also disclosed his advisory role at EigenLayer. Feist, known for his work on \u201cdanksharding,\u201d confirmed he had also received a significant allocation of EIGEN tokens and assured the community that his advisory role would not influence his positions on the development of EigenLayer.\n\nConflict of interest concerns\n\nThe disclosures have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, especially given the systemic risks EigenLayer might pose to Ethereum. EigenLayer is a platform that allows users to deposit and \u201cre-stake\u201d Ether from various liquid staking tokens to secure third-party networks or validated services.\n\nMany blockchain experts have expressed concerns about the potential centralization and additional load imposed on stakers by running restaking services.\n\nDrake assured the community that he would reinvest or donate all proceeds to worthy projects within the Ethereum ecosystem and pledged to end the advisorship if EigenLayer\u2019s direction conflicted with Ethereum\u2019s interests.\n\nFeist, in his disclosure, emphasized that he would take contrarian views on EigenLayer to focus on risks and decentralization. He wrote:\n\n\u201cI am taking this position personally, not representing the Ethereum Foundation, and with a focus on risks and decentralization. I do receive a significant amount of tokens from this position. I do not believe that they will change or influence my positions on how the core protocol should be developed, but I believe that the community should know about this so that they can keep me accountable.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s move to formalize a conflict of interest policy marks a significant step in addressing the community\u2019s concerns and maintaining trust within the ecosystem. The foundation is expected to provide further updates on the policy soon."

        "title": "ETH vs. ADA: Is Cardano or Ethereum a Better Investment in 2024? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Markets got a big spike in Ethereum price this week on crypto exchanges. What\u2019s behind it and what factors can investors take into consideration to determine whether Ether or its friend Cardano is the better buy?\n\nEthereum has a birthday coming up on July 30. It was launched in 2015 to create a \u201cworld computer\u201d with the same Web3 blockchain properties as Bitcoin has for storing cash and making payments.\n\nCardano was launched on September 23, 2017 by initial coin offering (ICO) and founded by an Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. Today it\u2019s the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEthereum Market Cap (May 22): $451.8 billion\n\nCardano Market Cap (May 22): $17.2 billion\n\nCertain differences between the two cryptocurrencies are an advantage for one or the other and a good reason to be bullish or bearish for ETH or ADA tokens.\n\nBut some of the two networks\u2019 differences are tradeoffs that are more complex to evaluate as yielding an advantage for either crypto. Here are 7 key factors at play in the future Ethereum price against Cardano:\n\n1. ETH vs. ADA \u2013 Technical Analysis (a tie)\n\nEthereum price is nearly all the way back to its ATH (all time high) after spiking this week on Ethereum spot ETF buzz. Cardano has a long way to go. That might actually be more bullish for ADA, with more upside left in its price.\n\nThe recent Ethereum ETF approval will shake up the entire meta for investing in Ether. If bulls take the price past $4,000, another 12.5% increase would pump ETH to $4,500\u2014 within striking range of the previous Ethereum ATH of $4,721 in Nov. 2021.\n\nForbes recently mentioned an Ethereum price prediction of $5,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck predicts $11,800 by 2030. An even more bullish outlook forecasts $10,000 ETH by the end of the year.\n\nOver the short term, Cardano technical indicators and moving averages over the weekly span recommended \u201cSell\u201d on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ethereum technical indicators for the seven-day span recommended \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d according to data from Investing.com.\n\n2. Ether Spot ETF \u2013 Regulatory Analysis (bullish ETH)\n\nThere\u2019s no denying it. Charles Hoskinson would certainly agree: U.S. regulators seem to favor Bitcoin and Ethereum over Cardano and other DeFi networks.\n\nThe SEC said okay to Ethereum futures ETFs in October, revealing it didn\u2019t seem to think of Ether as an unregistered security. However, the U.S. regulator has classified Cardano and other cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities in lawsuits against multiple blockchain companies, while ignoring Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nAs Fortune Magazine reported on May 1, \u201cFurthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints.\u201d\n\nThe SEC lawsuit against Ripple has taken years (since Dec. 2020) and still has not yet been resolved. It is costly and leaves the future unsure for the currencies under the government\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nMarkets abhor uncertainty.\n\nIt may not be fair, but it\u2019s a bullish factor for ETH and bearish for ADA.\n\n3. ADA vs. ETH \u2013 Fundamental Analysis (a wash)\n\nFundamental analysis is the preferred method of investors who are not total degenerates. Instead of chart technical analysis or meme currency voodoo economics, the fundamentalist looks at an investment prospect and asks what would \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d author Benjamin Graham do if he were here?\n\nGraham says:\n\n\u201cThe intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201d\n\nIf a business\u2019s expected future revenues discounted to the present day exceed its current market value, then it may be a good investment. If they match or fall short of the business\u2019s market cap, then it may be a poor investment.\n\nADA: $263.8 million TVL (3% annual reward rate + 121% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $16.4 Billion\n\nETH $64.9 Billion TVL (5.5% annual reward rate + 145% annual growth rate) / Market Cap: $453 Billion\n\nGoing by the data above without any further context, it appears Cardano would be the winner, because its inflows make up a much smaller portion of its market cap than Ethereum (0.019 to 0.22), but only if we expect it to grow at the same rate as Ethereum in the future.\n\nThe lopsided institutional adoption between the two will make that difficult for Cardano unless it finds a use case, a feature/benefit, and a narrative that shakes up the retail Internet markets for cryptocurrency.\n\n4. Cardano vs. Ethereum \u2013 Gas Fees (cat\u2019s game)\n\nThere are lower and more predictable fees on Cardano, but higher fees on Ethereum are also a feature, not necessarily a bug. They make it more expensive to misuse the network for cybercrime that doesn\u2019t pay, so it\u2019s more secure. Big institutions like that.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why the industry leader, Bitcoin\u2019s slow, expensive network, with a low transaction bandwidth holds its capital so well. In many ways these built-in costs qualify participants better than Know Your Customer policies and automatically and without discriminating on any basis other than ability and willingness to pay the network\u2019s fees.\n\nStill for newcomers, enterpreneurs, startups, and investors starting out with a smaller cash pile, smart contract blockchain networks with lower fees like Cardano have an advantage. Transaction fees on both networks are highly variable and spike during periods of high network use.\n\n5. Ease Of Use \u2013 Cardano (another tie)\n\nSome people in Web3 feel Ethereum has an ease-of-use problem. It\u2019s become too overgrown with complicated, byzantine layers on top of layers, creating a steeper learning curve and potential security threats.\n\nBlockchain advocate Daniel Cawrey wrote in a recent opinion article on Blockworks:\n\n\u201cEthereum is becoming a multilayered lasagna-like system whereby complexity and fees are pushing people to the margins, causing interoperability and security concerns.\u201d\n\nWhile true, much like Ethereum\u2019s higher transactions fees\u2014 the complexity of Ethereum may be a reason to be bullish for ETH. It could simply be proof of the network\u2019s success. As Cawrey acknowledges in the piece, the network is beginning to achieve its \u201cworld computer\u201d concept.\n\nAny computer architecture expert would be hard-pressed to explain how a Turing-complete global computer that anyone can use on a peer-to-peer network would become anything but a flying spaghetti monster of complexity.\n\n6. Ether vs. Cardano Whales (bullish ADA)\n\nA massive 15,000 ETH whale deposit to Kraken on May 18 spotted by Whale Alert suggested a bear run on Ether by whales could be incoming, but after the SEC approved the spot Ethereum ETF a surge in whale-sized transactions has been net positive for the network, according to IntoTheBlock data.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano whales have been extremely bullish for ADA in May. They boosted holdings in Cardano tokens by 11% in a month. Whales tend to be smart money with some of the most advanced analytics and market outlooks to know what they\u2019re doing, so that\u2019s positively bullish for Cardano.\n\nhttps://x.com/intotheblock/status/1790774801277042863\n\n7. Ethereum vs. Cardano Memes (bullish ETH)\n\nMeme coins are a definite advantage for Ethereum. While Cardano does have meme coins, none of them are notable and they have not topped the market cap charts like Ethereum\u2019s SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI.\n\nCardano has succeeded in making a simpler, lower-fee Ethereum, but crypto markets tend to reward projects that leaven their technology with some meme karma. Maybe an Orange Pill Moon Boys NFT collection or something with a dog on it would do the trick."

        "content": "Ethereum ETH/USD enthusiasts were left scratching their heads this week after the long-awaited approval of a spot Ethereum ETF failed to ignite the anticipated price surge.\n\nWhat Happened: While many expected a repeat of Bitcoin\u2018s BTC/USD rise following similar ETF approval in January, ETH prices have remained relatively flat.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the 19b-4 forms is a crucial step in the regulatory process but does not fully clear the path for ETF trading.\n\nThe S-1 registration statements, which provide detailed information about the ETFs to the SEC, must still be approved for trading to commence.\n\nThis approval is often seen as a formality, but the current political climate has added uncertainty.\n\nHowever, new information suggests the approval process might not be as straightforward as initially believed.\n\nGabriel Shapiro, co-founder of MetaLeX Labs, explains that only the 19b-4 forms were approved, not the S-1 registration statements.\n\nThis limited approval was made by the SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets under \u201cdelegated authority,\u201d allowing any commissioner to challenge the decision within ten days.\n\nShapiro suggests this procedural move indicates an attempt to obscure the political nature of the vote.\n\nShapiro hints at a broader political strategy, suggesting the SEC\u2019s actions are part of a \u201chorse trade\u201d to secure environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rules before a potential challenge by Donald Trump if he wins the 2024 election.\n\nThis complex backdrop contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of the S-1 forms, which Shapiro believes are unlikely to be approved soon.\n\nHe describes the situation as \u201cpolitical progress\u201d for crypto, similar to the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) Act.\n\nAlso Read: EXCLUSIVE: All You Need To Know About The FIT21 \u2018Crypto Bill\u2019\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, offers a counterpoint, expressing confidence that the S-1 forms will eventually be approved and downplaying the likelihood of significant challenges.\n\nHe attributes the lack of a price spike to the fact that the ETF approval was already anticipated by the market following earlier news.\n\n\u201cS-1s will be approved, don't be silly\u2026 It prob didn't moon IMO bc approval was baked in already based on Monday's bombshell news,\u201d Balchunas tweeted.\n\nScott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital questions the SEC\u2019s strategy, arguing that using crypto regulations as leverage for ESG rules undermines the commission\u2019s credibility and political strategy, especially if they fail to achieve their ESG objectives.\n\n\u201cThis is tough to square\u2026they don\u2019t get ESG rules and also lose all credibility that they actually intend to govern reasonably in a Biden second term,\u201d Johnsson stated.\n\nStaking and Market Dynamics\n\nPranav Kanade, Investment Partner at VanEck\u2018s Digital Assets Alpha Fund, highlighted another crucial factor: the nature of ETH staking in the approved ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETFs approved on May 23rd do not currently include staking, and all of the ETH held in these ETFs will remain unstaked. However, even if this were to change (via new staked ETH ETFs), the risk of staking concentration would be largely mitigated by three factors,\u201d Kanade explained.\n\nHe pointed out that regulatory and compliance requirements would likely prevent U.S. ETF issuers from staking with dominant players like Lido.\n\nAdditionally, emerging staking protocols are already reducing Lido\u2019s market share, and Lido itself is diversifying its node operators, minimizing concentration risks.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThese developments highlight the intricate interplay between regulatory actions and political considerations affecting Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nInvestors remain cautious as they await further clarity on the full approval process.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the implications of these regulatory shifts and the future of digital assets, industry leaders and investors can join Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nThis event will provide valuable insights into the evolving regulatory landscape and investment strategies within the digital asset space.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $108M Inflows While Ethereum ETF Potential Remains Uncertain\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "The crypto market was filled with euphoria over the past day with the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This came after months of speculation on the possibility of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nDespite the wave of joy that rippled across the crypto market, ETH\u2019s spot market price responded sluggish with buyers unable to seize the bullish sentiment. ETH\u2019s price traded between $3.5k and $3.9k during the time.\n\nHow will the ETF approval after Ethereum\u2019s price action in the short and long term?\n\nETH Move Priced In Before ETF Approval\n\nA look at the ETH price action on the four-hour timeframe showed that buyers could have seized the initiative, based on social sentiment to register a significant pump ahead of the approval.\n\nETH/USDT on TradingView (4H Timeframe)\n\nOn 20 May, ETH pumped 15% rising from $3.1k to $3.7k with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) noting the buying strength by rising to 93. Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) surged to a monthly high of +0.53.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the ETF approval showed profit taking moves with price dropping sharply below the $3.7k support level. This presents two trading plays for ETH, based on the short term and long term.\n\nShort term, ETH could dip from $3.7k to $3.4k offering 6.6% profit opportunities. From the $3.4k support level, ETH could go on a strong upward move toward a new all-time-high (ATH) above $4k for 12% profit.\n\nOpen Interest Supports Short Term Bearish Outlook\n\nETH Open Interest | Source: Coinalyze\n\nData from Coinalyze showed that market participants in the futures market leaned bearish in the short term with the Open Interest dropping by 3.49% over the past 24 hours.\n\nShorting ETH over the next few days could yield the best profit making opportunity on the altcoin before the Ethereum ETFs start trading, driving bullish sentiment in the long term.\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not constitute trading, investment, financial, or other types of advice.

        "content": "The broader crypto market experienced significant volatility during the past day as the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved several spot-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nCryptoSlate data shows that the top 20 digital assets by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC, saw losses exceeding 3% each. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two digital assets by market capitalization, fell to $67,051 and $3,671, respectively.\n\nSeveral market analysts have suggested that the ETH ETF approval was a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event. Investors who anticipated the approval had already positioned themselves accordingly. During the past week, ETH\u2019s price had risen by more than 20%, with CryptoSlate observing that the Ethereum futures market hit a one-year high of 3.6 million ETH.\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, noted:\n\n\u201cSeems like the market has already priced the Ethereum spot ETF approval. Grayscale\u2019s ETHE discount to ETH has significantly narrowed in the last few days. The same happened between GBTC and Bitcoin as the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval was nearing.\u201d\n\nSome experts also pointed to the ETFs\u2019 delayed launch as one of the reasons for the muted market performance. The SEC has only approved the ETFs and has yet to grant them the clearance to launch, which requires an approved S-1 filing, though this is more of a formality.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart explained:\n\n\u201cThis is just 19b-4 approval. Also needs to be an approval on the S-1 documents which is going to take time. We\u2019re expecting it to take a couple weeks but could take longer.\u201d\n\nOver $400 million liquidated\n\nOver 107,000 crypto traders suffered losses exceeding $400 million due to the market\u2019s subdued performance.\n\nCoinglass data reveals that ETH long traders, who expected the ETF news to boost the digital asset price, bore the brunt of these losses, totaling around $107 million. The largest single liquidation was a $12.4 million long bet on Ethereum on the Binance exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin traders lost approximately $75 million during the same period.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "How far will Ethereum (ETH) go? - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Sat 25 May 2024 \u25aa 10 min read \u25aa by Thomas A.\n\nBull markets in cryptocurrencies generally benefit altcoins in a second phase. In the month of May, Ethereum (ETH) performed over 15%, and nearly 65% since the beginning of the year. This resurgence of Ethereum comes after the SEC approved the establishment of ETFs on the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. While the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum remains high, the cyclicity of Ethereum\u2019s price seems to act with as much precision in the structure of this bull market. Decoding the indicators and the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nSoon an ETF to boost the market?\n\nAs with Bitcoin (BTC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the establishment of an ETF on Ethereum. Thus, this decision will allow major global managers to expand the cryptocurrency offerings to their clients. However, the SEC still needs to approve its commercialization\u2026\n\n\u201cThis decision follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which quickly attracted $13.3 billion in net inflows, setting performance records for ETFs at their launch. The arrival of Ethereum ETFs could experience similar success, attracting a new influx of capital to the second-largest cryptocurrency.\u201d Crypto: Ethereum ETFs approved by the SEC! \u2013 Cointribune\n\nThis same announcement for Bitcoin had particularly favored the price hike to historical highs. The arrival of an ETF on Ethereum thus leaves potential for a return to the November 2021 highs of $4,868. In May 2024, ETH thus represents nearly 17.7% of the market capitalization. This market share is still far behind Bitcoin, with a dominance near 53%.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs could thus instigate a catch-up effect compared to Bitcoin. Moreover, these ETFs could also be used to create ETFs representing a basket of cryptocurrencies in the future.\n\nTaking a look at fractals: the rise persists\n\nA major indicator for measuring the viability of the trend on ETH is to use fractals. Indeed, the Hurst exponent (read more) allows measuring the degree of trend persistence from one time scale to another. Furthermore, the Hurst exponent is ideally bounded between 0 and 1. With Ethereum, a Hurst exponent close to 1 indicates significant upward potential, and consequently a good symmetry with major lows. Conversely, a Hurst exponent close to 0 will indicate that the trend is anti-persistent and is likely to turn downward.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price (top chart) and Hurst exponent (bottom chart). Measures the positive (>0.5) or negative (<0.5) persistence of the trend. Graph and data by Thomas ANDRIEU.\n\nGraphically, we see that ETH gained significant upward potential in mid-2022, and reconfirmed it in early 2023. The ensuing bull market, in accordance with theory, was accompanied by a decrease in the Hurst exponent, signaling the loss of upward potential. In March 2024, the Hurst exponent was below 30%, indicating a bearish risk, or at least, the absence of upward potential. Nevertheless, the recent rebound in Ethereum seems to reaffirm a renewal of upward potential, thereby limiting the bearish risks observed in spring 2024.\n\nDespite everything, this approach encourages us to be more cautious about the nature of the bull market compared to 2023. Indeed, it appears clear that the bull market has exhausted a significant portion of its overall potential.\n\nThe cycles acting on ETH\n\nIn several papers, we have had the opportunity to highlight a cycle close to 3.6 years on Ethereum. Furthermore, this dominant cycle corresponds to the same dominant cycle as Bitcoin (BTC). The timing of this cycle thus allows us to judge, and compare, the different bull or bear markets. For example, the bull market observed on Bitcoin since 2023 is strongly symmetrical to previous bull markets.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we know that two cycles of 4 months and 22 months synchronized in February 2018. We are now looking for the time period needed to achieve the next constructive interference. By calculating the LCM(4,22), we get 44 months (3.6 years), which strongly correlates with the cyclicity of equities and Bitcoin (Bitcoin Cyclicity (BTC) \u2013 Cointribune).\u201d Technical Indicators: Constructive Interferences and Destructive Interferences \u2013 Cointribune\n\nThus, a little more than 3.6 years separate the major peak of 2018 from that of 2021 on Ethereum. Likewise, 3.6 years separate the major low of early 2019 from that of mid-2022, etc. We see here a clear cyclical dynamic, mainly fueled by the correlation of Ethereum with Bitcoin. In this perspective, which remains admittedly theoretical, we could expect an Ethereum peak around mid-2025. We will finally mention the good symmetry observed so far between the current bull market and the previous bull market.\n\nCurrent cycle for Ethereum and previous cycle\n\nETH remains correlated with Bitcoin\n\nIn our previous paper, we highlighted the importance of the correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin. The lows and the major lows of the cryptocurrency market are indeed linked to the relationship that exists between the two main cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWe notice in our case that a high correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and Ethereum is conducive to translating major lows on Bitcoin. Conversely, a low correlation coefficient (prominent low of the coefficient) is likely to translate a sharp weakening of market strength, and major peaks. A major explanation would be that, during bull markets, the dependence of altcoins on Bitcoin decreases.\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) decorrelates from other assets \u2013 Cointribune\n\nETH price (top chart) and 6-month correlation coefficient with Bitcoin price (bottom chart). Graph by Thomas ANDRIEU.\n\nGraphically, we can verify that major lows on ETH are linked by a very high correlation with Bitcoin. However, before major bull markets on ETH, we notice that the BTC/ETH correlation is minimal. In March 2024, the 6-month correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum thus reached a low around 70%. By symmetry, this indeed signaled the likely arrival of an intense bull market on ETH. The study of the correlation between the two assets, however, does not allow us to effectively judge the probable highs on Ethereum.\n\nDespite everything, we see that the correlation between the two assets remains generally high. It is mostly above 80%, which is significant.\n\nTowards $6,000?\n\nThe Technical Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price can provide us with additional elements. Indeed, we notice that the consolidation of March/April 2024 does not undermine the bullish trend initiated since 2023. On the contrary, the recent bullish breakout allows us to set an initial target (almost reached) towards the recent peaks around $4,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\n\nThen, as we have highlighted, it would be coherent, given the correlation with Bitcoin, to reach the historical peaks at $4,800. In the continuation of this theoretical bullish movement, the next extended target of the consolidation pattern (flag, logarithmic scale) would be near $6,000. This level does not seem graphically and statistically impossible. Conversely, continued difficulties in surpassing recent peaks, or a prolonged drop below $3,000, would signal a probable exit from the bullish trend.\n\nWe have also mentioned the good timing of this dynamic, similar to that of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, we see that a continued upward trend would be with less foundation than the rise of 2023 and early 2024. This necessarily encourages greater attention to market strength indicators.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs seems to have triggered a break in the consolidation since March. The upward trend on Ethereum thus continues:\n\nWith an extension of demand to ETFs and the rebound of Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nA weakening of bullish strength in terms of fractals. Nevertheless, the upward potential seems to be maintained in April/May concerning the price rebound.\n\nAdditionally, the market\u2019s timing and cyclicity still seem relevant. So far, a certain symmetry persists between the current bull market and the previous one. The upward dynamic is thus accompanied by the market\u2019s structural cycles.\n\nThe correlation with Bitcoin is maintained despite a decorrelation in March 2024. This signal indicates that the bull market on ETH is likely to continue in line with Bitcoin.\n\nFinally, Technical Analysis clearly shows a potential for continuation. The target towards previous peaks, then towards historical peaks, would thus be likely in a bull market. If the bullish strength is maintained, some extended targets are around $6,000, and beyond by extension.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency Will Soar 116%, According to Standard Chartered. Is It a Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A Standard Chartered analyst expects Ethereum to more than double by the end of the year. Here's how that bullish analysis checks out, and how it moved markets this week.\n\nAnalysts from a major British bank say that Ethereum (ETH 0.07%) should more than double from here to the end of 2024. Does this projection make sense?\n\nStandard Chartered's bullish Ethereum analysis\n\nGeoff Kendrick, head of crypto research and emerging markets foreign exchange at Standard Chartered (OTC: SCBF.F), hung an $8,000 year-end price target on Ethereum (ETH 0.07%) earlier this week.\n\nSpeaking to the crypto news site The Block on Tuesday, Kendrick predicted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Ethereum's spot price. He argued that the approval would inspire large money inflows into the Ethereum cryptocurrency, similar to the inflows that followed after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThe analyst also noted that he called the money-flow effects of the Bitcoin ETF approval correctly, and underscored the long-term price boosts that should result from these substantial investment moves.\n\nMind you, Kendrick based his Ethereum price target on his latest Bitcoin (BTC -1.31%) target. In other words, the Ethereum ETFs strike him as good news for the crypto market as a whole, not necessarily driving Ethereum prices any faster than the rest of the sector. Historically, Ethereum has closely followed Bitcoin's price movements due to their strong market correlation and shared investor sentiment.\n\n\"Given that we now see Bitcoin reaching the $150,000 level by end-2024, this would imply a level of $8,000 for Ether,\" the Standard Chartered analyst said.\n\nSEC moves closer to approving Ethereum ETFs\n\nTwo days later, the SEC approved a rule change that will result in the first Ethereum-based ETFs on the American markets. The funds aren't hitting the market right away, as the SEC must review each application in detail before approving anything. While this process could take months, the established precedent of Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the SEC's approval may be expedited. It's still a big move in the direction of final approvals, which looks like a matter of time now.\n\nCrypto investors were enthusiastic about Standard Chartered's forecast, driving Ethereum's price 23% higher the next day while Bitcoin rose as much as 7%.\n\nMarket reactions to the forecast and ETF news\n\nThe two largest cryptocurrencies barely moved on the actual ETF news, though. Ethereum has stayed steady since Kendrick's forecast and Bitcoin is down by a couple of percent on Friday.\n\nBut Kendrick's analysis still looks directionally correct. The combination of ETF approvals and the recent Bitcoin halving should indeed power another price surge in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many smaller altcoins over the next year or so. Growth investing star Cathie Wood of Ark Invest also pegged her year-end Bitcoin target at approximately $150,000, with much loftier long-term goals in mind.\n\nEvaluating Kendrick's analysis and its implications\n\nFrom a perspective of simple logic, the idea of rising crypto prices makes sense.\n\nBitcoin's market value is receiving boosts from both sides of the supply and-demand calculation. The halving of Bitcoin mining rewards makes it harder to come by freshly minted digital coins. At the same time, the new ETFs open the floodgates to nearly direct Bitcoin investments by several new types of buyers -- retail investors can now access Bitcoin ETFs (and soon Ethereum ETFs) in their retirement accounts, while institutional money managers can rely on familiar ETFs instead of opening new accounts in unapproved crypto exchanges.\n\nBurning the value candle at both ends, Bitcoin is experiencing higher demand and strictly limited supply. That's a recipe for higher prices, especially since the necessary Bitcoin mining process stops making economic sense unless coin prices increase enough to make up for the smaller rewards.\n\nAnd where Bitcoin goes, other cryptocurrencies tend to follow. In particular, Ethereum tends to follow Bitcoin's price chart quite closely:\n\nBalancing your portfolio with crypto investments\n\nStandard Chartered's Ethereum target stands 116% above the smart contracts pioneer's current price (and 160% beyond where it sat before Kendrick spoke to The Block). I can't promise that it will meet this exact goal, but I'm convinced that both Ethereum and Bitcoin will rise as the year plays out.\n\nUnexpected twists can throw a spanner in the works, of course, and other unplanned events might drive the cryptos even higher instead. You never really know what will happen in this young and volatile market until it happens.\n\nHence, I wouldn't recommend backing up the truck, betting the literal farm, or otherwise going overboard with crypto investments right now. A diversified approach with crypto playing a modest part in a diversified portfolio will let you enjoy the benefits of a price surge without risking it all. Ethereum looks like a solid buy today, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Kendrick's specific $8,000 target to materialize."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Could Lead to 'Serious' Security Risks, Say Experts - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nExperts are warning of the looming threat that the newly approved U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could pose if staking is ever introduced.\n\nIn a crucial bid to push the approval process over the line, Ethereum ETF issuers dropped language regarding the staking of customer ETH.\n\nWhen the network transitioned to a proof of stake consensus in September 2022, it required ETH to be locked up in a process called staking. The staked ETH belongs to validators who help to secure the network. They\u2019re rewarded for staking their ETH, but can be penalized if they don\u2019t verify transactions on time.\n\nCentralization concerns have arisen in the past when single validators gained control of large portions of staked ETH. At time, people have even compared liquid staking provider Lido to a \"cartel\" when it swelled in size.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRemoving staking language from ETH ETF applications was a move to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution could cause a long-term problem.\u201d Ganesh Swami, CEO and co-founder of blockchain data analytics company Covalent, told Decrypt, \u201cIf multiple ETFs use the same custodians, this type of centralization would cause concentration to increase, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.\u201d\n\nTaking a look at the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that Coinbase is the custodian for 90% of the total assets. While this poses an obvious centralization risk already, adding staking to the equation, well, ups the stakes.\n\n\u201cStaking ETH ETFs are not a new concept, they exist in other countries, but clearly the U.S market brings a much larger scale,\u201d Andrew O\u2019Neill, analytical lead on digital assets at S&P Global, told Decrypt. \u201cThe risk in that case is that if ETFs are concentrating their stake with a small number of custodians, this could create validator concentration risks in the consensus mechanism.\u201d\n\nCoinbase, which is already the second largest Ethereum validator, is currently set to be the custodian of at least six out of the nine firms planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If we see similar interest as we did with the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which as a group currently have a market capitalization of $54 billion, this concentration of power could pose a security risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can measure concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower that number, the higher the central point of failure.\u201d Mona El Isa, CEO and co-founder of institutional DeFi company Avantgarde Finance, told Decrypt, \u201cIf any party amassed that much control, they could potentially alter the state of the blockchain itself. That poses serious risks to security.\u201d\n\nIt appears that staking was removed from Ethereum ETF applications due to the SEC\u2019s view that staking is equivalent to a securities service. It\u2019s not without precedence. The SEC has sued companies, like Kraken and Coinbase, to stop them offering staking services to U.S. customers.\n\nAs staking is currently not allowed for ETF providers or custodians, there are no guidelines put in place to reduce the potential centralization and concentration risks that could be looming.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is swiftly developing a formal policy to address potential conflicts of interest. This initiative follows the revelation that two of its researchers received substantial incentives from the EigenLayer project.\n\nExecutive Director Aya Miyaguchi emphasized the importance of maintaining the foundation\u2019s neutrality to effectively serve the ecosystem.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s credible neutrality is critical for us to perform our role in the ecosystem. We are aware of the current conversation about potential conflicts of interest, and share the community\u2019s concerns.\n\n\n\nIt is clear that relying on culture and individual judgment\u2026 \u2014 Aya Miyaguchi (ayamiya.eth) (@AyaMiyagotchi) May 24, 2024\n\nThe foundation\u2019s action comes after researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist disclosed receiving significant EigenLayer token incentives. Drake highlighted the substantial value of the tokens, potentially surpassing all his other assets.\n\nMiyaguchi reiterated the foundation\u2019s dedication to its role within the blockchain community. She acknowledged that previous reliance on culture and individual judgment was insufficient. The new policy aims to formalize the approach to conflict resolution and enhance the foundation\u2019s integrity.\n\nLefteris Karapetsas, a former Ethereum software engineer and the founder of the cryptocurrency portfolio tracking tool Rotki, believes the Ethereum Foundation should adequately compensate its employees so that they do not feel the need to seek additional compensation packages elsewhere.\n\nThis development marks a significant step in addressing community concerns and ensuring the foundation\u2019s actions align with its ethical standards."

Given their Polkadot 2.0 release and the JAM ( Join-Accumulate Machine) white paper and the correlation with ETH, I\u2019m expecting a lot from them. Next target is likely $18.\u201d\n\nPolkadot is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe analyst also believes the broader altcoin market is entering a bullish phase after correcting.\n\n\u201cThe altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction. The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60%-70% from here. I think Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next two-four months.\u201d\n\nHe says alts could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cThe altcoins are still heavily undervalued. Most of them are down 70% against Bitcoin. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be having any correction, but feeling fear of missing out (FOMO) here is the wrong emotion to have. In the coming months, I expect altcoins to do way better.\u201d\n\nLastly, the analyst says he is bullish on Bitcoin but expects the crypto king to retest the $68,000 level on the 12-hour chart before continuing upward.\n\n\u201cBitcoin slowly consolidating.

        "content": "Institutions gobbled up Bitcoin after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThey might not show the same interest in Ethereum, according to researcher Noelle Acheson.\n\nBitcoin hit new highs just weeks after the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe move let institutions gobble up more than $12 billion worth of the original cryptocurrency, according to data from pseudonymous analyst Hildobby.\n\nEthereum investors might not be so lucky.\n\nSeveral indicators suggest institutional interest in Ethereum is much lower than it was for Bitcoin, according to researcher Noelle Acheson, former head of market insights for Genesis Global Trading.\n\nShe isn\u2019t the only pessimist.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects Ethereum ETFs to be \u201c10-15% of the assets of the BTC ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe SEC had long fought against the approval of spot crypto ETFs, arguing they were vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nAfter losing a lawsuit filed by crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments, the SEC capitulated in January with the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nStill, it had signalled it would deny applications for spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThat changed this week, amid a flurry of pro-crypto developments in the US.\n\nOn Monday, Balchunas and his colleague James Seyffart updated their odds of spot Ethereum ETF approval to 75% from 25%.\n\nThat approval came Thursday, but the actual launch may be weeks or months away. And whether it drives Ethereum to its own all-time high is another matter.\n\n\u201cWhen/if the ETH spot ETFs eventually launch, we should brace ourselves for a disappointing reception,\u201d Acheson wrote in her newsletter, Crypto is Macro.\n\nThat\u2019s in part because institutional investors have shown little interest in existing Ethereum-based products.\n\nIn Hong Kong, which approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last month, Ethereum accounts for less than 15% of the assets under management, Acheson notes.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, investors already have access to Ethereum futures ETFs. And they aren\u2019t that interested.\n\n\u201cThe [assets under management] of the leading ETH futures ETF (EETH) is around 4% that of the leading BTC futures ETF (BITO),\u201d Acheson writes.\n\nAs for the spot Ethereum ETF itself, available data suggests institutional interest might be lacking there as well.\n\n\u201cThe CME is the largest BTC derivatives platform in the market, in terms of open interest,\u201d Acheson writes.\n\n\u201cBut it ranks only fifth in ETH derivatives. US institutional investors are maybe just not really into the ETH narrative?\u201d\n\nTo be sure, open interest in Bitcoin was highest on Binance, with CME taking the top spot just before the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already happening with Ethereum: CME was in the sixth spot at the beginning of the week.\n\nAnd Wall Street executives have repeatedly said they see potential in Ethereum.\n\n\u201cRemove the regulatory uncertainty around proof of stake and watch how Wall Street runs to ETH,\u201d investor Jim Bianco wrote on X, referring to the method Ethereum uses to confirm transactions and create new coins.\n\n\u201cIt is an entire ecosystem with borrowing, lending, insurance, tokenomics, staking (yield), stablecoins, NFTS, primitives, L2s, and on and on. Plenty for them to work with here as opposed to hodl-ing one coin,\u201d he said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 3.2% at $67,297 over the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum is down 3.4% at $3,679.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nAleks Gilbert is a DeFi correspondent based in New York.

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ether: SEC opens door to Ethereum ETFs - Business Today",
        "content": "In a landmark decision, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has signalled its approval for the potential launch of eight exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. This move follows the SEC's approval of the first bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, marking a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThe SEC's approval on Thursday involved crucial rule changes that pave the way for ETFs that directly invest in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Applications from prominent financial groups such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Ark Invest received the green light. While this represents a major step forward, a second round of approvals will be necessary before these products can officially launch.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding these approvals has fueled a surge in ether's price, which has climbed more than 20% since Monday and over 60% since the beginning of the year. This reflects the growing confidence among investors regarding the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC's decision comes after months of silence on the matter. On Monday, the regulator unexpectedly provided feedback on pending applications to issuers and exchanges, triggering a flurry of paperwork revisions and submissions. This swift action was likely prompted by approaching deadlines for responses to ether ETF applications from VanEck and Ark Invest.\n\nWhile the SEC's Thursday approval marks a significant milestone, the timing of the second round of approvals and the subsequent launch of ether ETFs remains unclear.\n\nCommenting on the development, Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink stated: \"The Ethereum ETF approval is a second large step forward for the crypto industry... The attention and adoption around the Ethereum ETF also proves the long-term thesis we have been building around, that the capital markets will be the next large source of adoption for the cryptocurrency industry, essentially being the key force that is driving it to new heights.\"\n\nNazarov highlighted the potential of the approval to shine a spotlight on Ethereum's smart contract and decentralised application capabilities, which are attracting growing interest from major financial institutions.\n\nSumit Gupta, Co-founder of CoinDCX commented, \"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s green light for spot Ether ETFs is a watershed moment for the crypto industry. It builds on the success of Bitcoin ETFs, offering a secure and regulated way for investors to access Ether. This broader acceptance will fuel mainstream adoption and reflect a maturing regulatory environment, paving the way for further legitimising the entire digital asset space.\"\n\n\"Ethereum plays a pivotal role in the decentralised ecosystem, and this regulatory progress will be instrumental in shaping the future of Web3 and the ongoing digital revolution. The SEC decision is particularly important, as earlier media reports suggested the SEC was investigating the Ethereum Foundation, coupled with the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH), and its potential classification as a security,\" Gupta added.\n\nMeanwhile, Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman of CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem India Ltd said, \"The SEC's approval of Ethereum ETFs marks a watershed moment in digital finance, poised to catalyse a sustained bull run while tempering volatility to align with traditional asset classes. This monumental achievement not only validates the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies but also sets the stage for widespread institutional and retail involvement. Regulated investment vehicles for Ethereum will bolster investor confidence and ignite further innovation within the blockchain sphere.\"\n\nMaradiya added, \"In the Indian market, this development heralds a new era of global digital asset integration, offering invaluable insights for our regulators. Indian investors stand to benefit from expanded portfolio diversification and enhanced access to global crypto markets. This pivotal juncture has the potential to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption in India, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic financial ecosystem. Moreover, it presents retail investors with a unique opportunity to harness the power of this asset class for wealth creation.\"\n\nThis landmark decision by the SEC could potentially usher in a new era for cryptocurrencies, further solidifying their integration into traditional financial markets."

        "content": "Ethereum core developers have set their sights on launching Pectra, the blockchain\u2019s next major upgrade, by the end of the first quarter of 2025. This ambitious timeline hinges significantly on the inclusion of the EVM Object Format (EOF), a collection of about 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to introduce an opt-in container for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. The EOF represents a pivotal advancement, promising enhanced efficiency and flexibility for developers and users alike.\n\nPectra\u2019s upgrade is poised to be transformative, with the integration of PeerDAS, a cutting-edge data availability sampling solution. PeerDAS leverages Ethereum\u2019s existing peer-to-peer infrastructure to enhance data integrity and accessibility, thus bolstering the overall robustness of the network. This innovation is crucial for maintaining ETH\u2019s competitive edge in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the Pectra upgrade is the replacement of the existing account abstraction EIP-3074 with a newly proposed EIP-7702, authored by Ether co-founder Vitalik Buterin. EIP-7702 aims to elevate externally owned accounts (EOAs) by enabling them to operate as smart contract wallets during transactions. This enhancement is expected to streamline user interactions with decentralized applications (dApps), making Ether more user-friendly and versatile.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Upgrades: Prague And Electra In Pectra\n\nPectra comprises two main components: the Prague upgrade on the Execution Layer and the Electra upgrade on the Consensus Layer. Together, these updates will usher in a series of technical improvements designed to enhance Ether\u2019s scalability, security, and functionality. Despite the forward momentum, some elements of the upgrade remain under discussion. Notably, there is a consideration to postpone the implementation of Verkle trees, a complex and critical upgrade aimed at optimizing data storage and retrieval on the Ethereum network, to the subsequent Osaka hardfork.\n\nThe development community is actively debating the final scope of Pectra, ensuring that all changes align with Ethereum\u2019s long-term vision and objectives. This collaborative approach underscores the dynamic and open nature of Ethereum\u2019s development process, where community input and rigorous testing are paramount.\n\nAs the proposed launch date for Pectra approaches, the level of excitement building around the Ethereum ecosystem is increasing. It is said that these planned upgrades will considerately boost the performance and usability of the platform in cementing its position as one of the leading blockchain networks. Strong momentum for future innovations and scaling towards greater deployment within the decentralized tech space.\n\nRelated Reading | Dogecoin Analyst Foresees 13x Surge to $2 Amid Potential Altseason Boom"

        "content": "You can gain exposure to cryptocurrency without buying any by purchasing shares of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Bitcoin Trusts, or ETPs linked to cryptocurrency futures through cryptocurrency exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Commission also gave three exchanges the green light to begin listing eight Ether Spot ETPs in May 2024.\n\nThese indirect ways of investing in crypto are much cheaper and possibly less risky than purchasing crypto outright. Here\u2019s what you need to know if you want to invest in crypto without buying crypto.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Although cryptocurrency has existed for some time, many consider it a relatively new investment with a major learning curve.\n\nInvesting directly in cryptocurrencies can be challenging because of their volatility, and some investors prefer using more traditional investments.\n\nYou can indirectly invest in crypto through funds and cryptocurrency-related stocks.\n\nOptions include spot and futures-based crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhat Is Indirect Crypto Investing?\n\nYou have options if you don\u2019t want to open an account on a crypto exchange and buy cryptocurrencies. You can invest in cryptocurrency indirectly through traditional methods like stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs.\n\nThere are pros and cons to consider, including security, fees, and the risk of losses. When you buy cryptocurrency through third parties, those funds are going to earn their keep somehow, so you should consider any additional costs when deciding whether to buy crypto using an indirect method.\n\n\n\nHere are some ways you can invest in crypto indirectly.\n\nCrypto ETFs\n\nWhen trying to get broad access to a particular asset class, the first port of call is usually ETFs. Investment funds can be found that track pretty much everything, from gold to the S&P 500. Unfortunately, with cryptocurrency, it\u2019s a little more complicated.\n\nAfter many years of denying spot cryptocurrency ETF applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under pressure from a 2023 D.C. Court of Appeals decision, approved the first 11 in January 2024. Previously, the regulator only gave the green light to ETFs that owned bitcoin futures contracts. Here are some:\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF)\n\nGlobal X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS)\n\nHere are the first Bitcoin spot ETFs to be approved:\n\nARK 21shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nBitwise Bitcoin Trust (BITB)\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\nIshares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nVaneck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nWisdomtree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\nIn May 2024, the SEC gave three exchanges approval to list certain Ether Spot ETFs. NYSE Arca, Nasdaq, and Cboe BZX are able to list and trade shares of:\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust (NYSE Arca)\n\nBitwise Ethereum ETF (NYSE Arca)\n\niShares Ethereum Trust (Nasdaq)\n\nVanEck Ethereum Trust (Cboe BZX)\n\nARK21 Ethereum ETF (Cboe BZX)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (Cboe BZX)\n\nFidelity Ethereum Fund (Cboe BZX)\n\nFranklin Ethereum ETF (Cboe BZX)\n\nThere are catches to investing in crypto this way. First, futures contracts and ETF shares don\u2019t necessarily deliver the same returns as their target assets. Second, ETFs for crypto can be complex and have fees that can eat into your potential returns.\n\nFees and underlying investments vary based on which fund you choose, so be sure to read the prospectus carefully to know what you\u2019re getting.\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nOnce spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, calls became louder for Ethereum's native token, ether, to get the same treatment. Ether-based ETFs were only able to use futures contracts to track the price of ether rather than directly holding the digital currency, as traditional ETFs and now many Bitcoin ETFs can do. However, this has changed following the SEC's May 2024 exchange proposal approval.\n\nAsset managers like VanEck, Grayscale, and Fidelity have filed for permission to launch Ethereum ETFs, which would give investors exposure to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency via SEC-regulated funds. This would likely give Ethereum greater liquidity, improve price tracking, and lead to potentially lower fees than futures-based ETFs can offer.\n\n\n\nOther countries, including Canada, have been quicker in adopting spot crypto ETFs.\n\nCrypto ETFs vs. Crypto ETPs\n\nETPs are financial instruments that track underlying securities, an index, or other financial products traded on exchanges. They can be purchased and sold throughout the trading day, like stocks. ETFs are the most common form of ETP. Other types of ETPs are exchange-traded notes, which specialize in debt securities, and exchange-traded commodities, which track the performance of commodities such as precious metals, agricultural products, and energy resources.\n\nWhen the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, they were classified as ETPs under the Securities Act of 1933 rather than ETFs as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940. Thus, the term ETP is a bit of a misnomer, though Investopedia has followed the more common usage in the investment community despite the SEC's determination.\n\nWhat are the implications? Besides having a less diversified portfolio, ETPs are governed by slightly different rules. Diversification and the type of assets held played a role in this designation. With bitcoin ETPs, physical spot exposure is given to a single commodity of cryptocurrency. Conventional funds, like other ETFs and mutual funds, must hold a more diverse range of assets. Registered under the Securities Act of 1933, ETPs are not subject to the same diversification and leverage restrictions as ETFs. This provides more flexibility in the types of assets they can hold, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile ETPs are subject to securities regulations, they do not offer the same level of investor protection as ETFs. Investors should exercise more caution and conduct thorough due diligence. The tax treatment of ETFs and ETPs can also differ. Investors should consult with tax professionals to understand the tax implications of investing in crypto ETPs. Lastly, the crypto market in which crypto ETPs are now players (since they have to trade crypto tokens) is not SEC or CFTC-regulated.\n\nCryptocurrency and Blockchain Stocks\n\nAnother way to invest in crypto without buying digital tokens is to purchase shares in companies that work in blockchain or hold cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nCompanies specializing in blockchain technology are often involved in crypto mining, software development, and other blockchain-based services. Notables include Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Canaan Inc. (CAN), HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE), and Bitfarms (BITF). These companies have different risk and reward trade-offs than those directly invested in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlternatively, some companies hold cryptocurrencies or are directly involved in them. For instance, Coinbase (COIN), a publicly traded company, is one of the largest and best-known cryptocurrency exchanges. As of its Dec. 31, 2023 Form 10-K, it held more than 74,000 bitcoin, ether, solana, and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGenerally, as crypto prices decline, related stocks also struggle. This volatility is one of the risks inherent in this sector, a key point to remember when exposing your portfolio to crypto-related products. Given the rapid changes in cryptocurrency regulations and market moves\u2014and as a general rule of thumb for investing\u2014it's prudent to diversify your portfolio to guard against crypto's risks and consult a trusted financial professional to review your investment plans.\n\nThere are also ETFs that specifically invest in companies with links to cryptocurrencies.\n\nCrypto and Your 401(k)\n\nYou can invest a part of your retirement funds in cryptocurrencies with minimal effort. In 2022, Fidelity announced that clients could add Bitcoin to its 401(k) accounts. Fidelity buys the coins and holds them in a digital asset account.\n\nThis was a major step toward bringing cryptocurrencies fully within the mainstream through traditional retirement investment portfolios. Ultimately, it's often up to your employer to decide on the specific portfolio of funds available to you for your 401(k).\n\nCredit Card Rewards\n\nCredit card rewards are one final method to fill your cryptocurrency portfolio without opening your fiat wallet. Several cards allow you to earn crypto when you swipe, tap, dip, click, or do anything else to use a credit card for payment.\n\nExamples of cryptocurrency credit cards include the Gemini Credit Card, and cards offered by the Crypto.com and Coinbase exchanges.\n\nSome cards, like the Venmo credit card, offer flexible redemption options, including cryptocurrency. When you earn crypto as a credit card reward, you invest in crypto without buying crypto.\n\nIs Crypto Worth Investing in? There are many risks when investing in crypto\u2014fraud, hacks, significant losses from price fluctuations, regulatory changes, and more. It's best to talk to a financial advisor familiar with cryptocurrency to learn if it's suitable for your financial circumstances and portfolio.\n\nHow do Beginners Invest in Cryptocurrency? Knowing how to invest in crypto can be intimidating, given the complexity of blockchain technology, the hype surrounding it, and the many available currencies. The first step is to get up to speed on the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, how blockchain technology underpins them, the kind of crypto wallet you will need, and the differences among cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and altcoins. Reputable resources such as Investopedia and courses offered by universities\u2014many freely available online\u2014can be invaluable. Platforms like Coinbase or Binance might be a good choice for your initial steps into the market since they have accessible interfaces and resources to guide you. Once in, stay updated on crypto news and regulatory developments.\n\n\n\nWhich Crypto Is Best to Invest in Now? Investing in cryptocurrency comes with many risks, the most prevalent being the loss of capital from wild price swings. If you feel you must invest in cryptocurrency, it's best to talk to a financial advisor who is familiar with it and find out if it's suitable for your financial circumstances. Additionally, it's essential to remember you should never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially when investing in cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency directly requires getting set up on an exchange and finding ways to store your digital coins safely. It can also mean potentially having a lot of money tied up in a volatile asset.\n\nFortunately, there are alternatives. You can invest indirectly in cryptocurrencies through ETFs that own future contracts tied to currency prices, bitcoin ETFs that securitize bitcoin holdings, or by purchasing shares in companies involved in cryptocurrency mining, software development, and other services. Alternatively, you can consider a credit card with cryptocurrency rewards or see if your employer offers this asset class through your 401(k).\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications from Nasdaq, CBOE and NYSE to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of Ethereum (ether) on Thursday, potentially paving the way for the crypto products to begin trading later this year.\n\n\n\nWhile the ETF issuers also have to get the green light before the products can launch, the latest approval is a major surprise win for those firms and the cryptocurrency industry, which were expecting the SEC to reject the filings. Prior to this, Bitcoin ETFs were already approved in January this year, sparking a renewed interest in the crypto space.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNine issuers including VanEck, ARK Investments/21Shares and BlackRock are likely to launch ETFs tied to the second-largest crypto, Ethereum, after the SEC in January approved bitcoin ETFs in a watershed moment for the industry. Market participants see it as a significant step towards getting the products trading.\n\n\n\nThe US SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs following Bitcoin spot ETFs marks a significant advancement in the crypto market, enhancing investor access and liquidity. Institutional investors can now gain a regulated avenue for exposure, fostering broader market participation. This milestone indicates growing regulatory acceptance of cryptos, said Edul Patel CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"After Hong Kong and the US, it is likely that many more countries will follow suit in approving spot ETFs of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such approvals can boost investor confidence, stimulate market growth, and encourage further innovation in the sector, ultimately leading to a more robust and mature global financial landscape,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThursday's move was nothing less-than a surprise as it was the deadline for the SEC to decide on VanEck's filing. Market participants were bracing for the thumbs-down as the SEC had not engaged with them on the applications.\n\n\n\nThe exchange applications had sought SEC approval for a rule change required to list new products, but the issuers still need the SEC to approve ETF registration statements detailing investor disclosures before they can start trading.\n\n\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s green light for spot Ether ETFs is a big moment for the crypto industry. It builds on the success of Bitcoin ETFs, offering a secure and regulated way for investors to access Ether. This broader acceptance will fuel mainstream adoption and reflects a maturing regulatory environment, said Sumit Gupta, co-founder at CoinDCX.\n\n\n\n\"The classification of Ethereum as a security could have significant ramifications for the Web3 industry. Ethereum is the foundation for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 projects. It is anticipated that a spot Ether (ETH) ETF could drive a rally in the asset class to new highs,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite the positive news, Ethereum dropped about 5 per cent in the last 24 hours to $3,655 as of 13.30 hours IST. The total market capitalization of Etheruem stood little more than $440 billion, while the total marketcap of all crypto assets stood at $2.5 trillion as of same time."

        "content": "Yesterday, the crypto market was stunned by the approval of Ethereum ETFs. Amid this, veteran trader Peter Brandt issued a warning regarding the future of staking in the cryptocurrency space, particularly with respect to Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandt predicted significant turmoil, suggesting that staking could lead to massive financial losses and bankruptcy.\n\nIn particular, the trader, known for his controversial market predictions, called the staking inherently risky. He compared it to a leveraged asset, where investors borrow or leverage ETH or SOL by lending them out at interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Brandt emphasized that this process inevitably attracts the attention of regulators. He predicted that central banks and government treasuries will soon impose strict regulations on staking, which will eventually put an end to it in its current form.\n\nStaking\n\n=\n\nOwning/borrowing/leveraging an asset (ETH/SOL/name it)\n\nLending it out for revenue (i.e.: interest)\n\n=\n\nEventual involvement by CBs/govt treasuries\n\n=\n\nRegulatory authority over staking\n\n=\n\nEnd to staking https://t.co/hv835g3pfK \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) May 24, 2024\n\nHe expressed skepticism about the sustainability of betting activities, drawing a parallel to historical financial scams. Brandt suggested that many investors seeking high returns through betting may soon realize the flaws in their strategy, citing the infamous figure of Carlo Ponzi, after whom Ponzi schemes are named.\n\nBrandt's warning coincides with the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs . Notably, all issuers of these ETFs did not include staking point in their applications. This exclusion highlights a critical distinction: while nonstaked ETH is classified as a commodity, staked ETH is treated as a security by the SEC.\n\nDespite these concerns, staking is still of significant interest to ETF issuers. It offers them the opportunity to earn interest simply by holding tokens and participating in network verification."

        "content": "The chief investment officer of crypto fund manager Bitwise is predicting new all-time highs for Ethereum (ETH) if spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are ultimately approved.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a rule change that sets the stage for the potential green lighting of spot market Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Matt Hougan predicts investor inflows into ETH ETFs would total billions of dollars and drive ETH beyond its all-time high of about $4,900, which it hit back in November 2021.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Ethereum ETFs will match Bitcoin ETFs. But I do think it will be measured in terms of many billions of dollars\u2026\n\nWill it be enough to drive Ethereum to new all-time highs? I definitely think that\u2019s possible as well. If Bitcoin ETFs did $12 billion in their first four months, I think Ethereum ETFs will do less than half of that but more than a quarter of that. And that\u2019s going to be pretty significant. Remember, that\u2019s against a market with no net new supply. So I think there is real demand.\u201d\n\nHougan believes that ETFs with exposure to multiple digital assets will also launch in the future and investor demand will exist for the different types.\n\n\u201cI think if you think about the ETF investor market if I had to put numbers on it a year from now, I think you\u2019ll have 30% of the market that\u2019s Bitcoin only, you\u2019ll have like 50% of the market that\u2019s a mix, you\u2019ll have 20% of the market that\u2019s ETH only\u2026\n\nMany professional investors looking at the crypto market are looking for sort of tech alpha. They\u2019re looking for that high-returning asset. Ethereum fits nicely into that dialogue. So I think you\u2019ll see all three. And I think the market as a whole will benefit from there being multiple crypto asset ETFs if that\u2019s what we get. It makes the market feel more robust, more real. There\u2019s more to talk about. I think it\u2019ll be a net positive. These are going to be significant.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $3,736 at time of writing, down more than 1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The price of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) could soar by 60% following the approval of the first-ever Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds by U.S. regulators, according to a leading crypto trading firm.\n\nWhat Happened: The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first Ethereum spot ETFs in the U.S. This decision could lead to a significant surge in the value of the second-largest cryptocurrency, according to a post on Telegram from the crypto trading firm QCP Capital.\n\nQCP Capital predicted a 60% increase in the value of Ethereum after the ETF approval. The news of the potential approval has already caused Ethereum\u2019s price to surge by nearly 20% since Monday.\n\n\u201cWith Friday implied volatility above 100%, the market is expecting fireworks,\u201d QCP wrote.\n\nSee Also: Bonk, Pepe Outstrip Gains Of Bitcoin, Ethereum Amid Searing Hot Rally \u2014 Beat Biggies Dogecoin And Shiba Inu In Trading Volumes\n\nQCP Capital also pointed out that the approval of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETFs in January led to a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value. Since then, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of over $73,000. This has also resulted in a substantial increase in Ethereum purchases, with CryptoQuant data showing an 85% rise in Ethereum taker buy volume since May 1.\n\nWhy It Matters: The potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. The approval of Ethereum ETFs would open the door for mainstream investors to access the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to a surge in its value. This development could also affect other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, which may find it harder to outperform Ethereum after the ETF approval.\n\nMoreover, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could have political implications. As Cathie Wood predicted, crypto could be a significant issue in the 2024 White House race. The approval of Ethereum ETFs could further solidify the importance of crypto in the political landscape.\n\nAdditionally, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could bring back the \u201canimal spirits\u201d to the crypto market, as predicted by a crypto trader.\n\nPrice Action: Ether is trading at $3,672, down nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, however, the coin is up nearly 20% this week and 56.08% up year to date.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Sink Over Inflation Concern In Fed Minutes: Analyst Says Odds \u2018In Favor\u2019 Of King Crypto Bulls\n\nImage Via Shutterstock"

This marks a significant milestone for the crypto industry.\n\nJust a few days ago, many analysts did not anticipate such a decision, as the SEC had not discussed the applications with the involved parties. Then came the surprise overnight on Friday. All eight applicants received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to enable ETF trading: Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Ark/21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco Galaxy.\n\nThis could pave the way for trading such products later this year. But before trading can begin, providers must still clarify the details with regulatory authorities. An authorized S-1 filing, a comprehensive document containing information about the company's finances and risk profile, as well as the securities it plans to offer, will be necessary for this.\n\nUnexpected Market Reactions\n\nThis could be a reason why the price of Ether dropped by almost 6 percent after rising by 20 percent earlier in the week. However, most of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are also currently experiencing price losses.\n\nBig Brother Bitcoin\n\nThis is the SEC's second decision on exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the cryptocurrency space. After a long legal battle, the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs and ETPs in January 2024. According to BTC-ECHO, over 13 billion dollars has flowed into Bitcoin-based ETFs in the last four months.\n\nWill the Ether ETFs be able to mirror Bitcoin ETFs? Investors and market participants will be watching this closely."

        "content": "The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on one Ethereum (ETH) competitor.\n\nTurner tells the 2.47 million subscribers of the Coin Bureau channel that the layer-1 blockchain Fantom (FTM) possesses more upside potential based on technical analysis.\n\n\u201cThe weekly chart appears to be painting a wonky head and shoulders pattern that looks eerily similar to the topping pattern FTM saw in late 2021. Notably, this pattern implies that there could be one more leg higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to Turner, Fantom could go up by approximately 98%, nearing double its current price.\n\n\u201cZooming out on the weekly chart suggests that FTM could rally as high as $1.60 in the short to medium term where it will likely stall out due to resistance, also known as bag holders, from the previous bull market. After that, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nFantom is trading at $0.810 at time of writing.\n\nOn the reasons supporting his bullish thesis for Fantom, the Coin Bureau host says,\n\n\u201cFTM has some solid \u2018pump-a-mentals,\u2019 so to speak.

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETFs Approved, Massive BTC, ETH Volatility, Major CEO Steps Down: This Week\u2019s Crypto Recap - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "It was another eventful week in the cryptocurrency markets, with Ethereum going under the spotlight this time. Let\u2019s unpack.\n\nLast weekend went very quietly, with little to no real action in terms of news and price movements. However, everything changed on Monday evening when Bloomberg\u2019s ETF experts raised their prediction rate for the SEC approving spot Ethereum ETFs this week to 75% from 25%.\n\nThis caused immediate shock in the markets, as ETH exploded by over 20% from $3,100 to a multi-week peak of $3,800. The rally kept going in the following days for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which exceeded $3,930 at one point as speculations arose about whether it would be able to break the $4,000 barrier.\n\nBitcoin also followed suit on the way up and skyrocketed from $67,000 to a six-week high of its own at almost $72,000 on Monday evening. However, both assets failed to maintain their run at the end of the week, even though the big news from yesterday was that the Securities and Exchange Commission had indeed approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs to go live for trading in the US at some point.\n\nBoth BTC and ETH dropped by more than 4% just hours before the ETFs were greenlighted, faced tons of volatility after that, and failed to recover most losses. In fact, ETH has performed worse than BTC on a 24-hour scale and sits at $3,700 now, while bitcoin is above $68,000.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!\n\nStill, ETH is among the top performers in the past week, having surged by 18%. Other big gainers from this week include BONK (43% up) and PEPE, which charted a few consecutive all-time highs.\n\nMarket Data\n\nMarket Cap: $2.676T | 24H Vol: $133B | BTC Dominance: 50.2%\n\nBTC: $68,191 (+1.47%) | ETH: $3,671 (+18%) | BNB: $596 (+2.5%)\n\nThis Week\u2019s Crypto Headlines You Can\u2019t Miss\n\nSEC Approves Spot Ethereum ETFs for Public Trading. As mentioned above, the biggest news this week in the entire industry came from the US securities regulator. Despite previous dabbling with whether ETH is a security or not, the SEC greenlighted eight spot Ethereum ETFs, perhaps due to political pressure.\n\n8-Day Winning Streak: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Strong Inflows. The ETF front has been quite strong in the past several days as the spot BTC products recorded an impressive streak that now stretches to nine consecutive days of positive inflows.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: A Delicious Slice of Crypto History Turns 14. May 22 will forever remain in the Bitcoin history books as the Pizza Day. On this day, 14 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz made one of the first transactions involving paying with BTC and purchasing two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for 10,000 BTC, and we celebrated this massive achievement earlier this week.\n\nSolana ETFs to See More Demand Than Other Altcoin Funds: Bloomberg Analyst. Following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the approval of Ethereum-based products, experts have now started to speculate which will be the next crypto asset in line. According to Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart, Solana ETFs could follow suit, but there\u2019s a lot of controversy on that front.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein Steps Down. Another big piece of news from this week came from the company behind the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF \u2013 Grayscale. Michael Sonnenshein, who spent 10 years at the asset manager, decided to step down from his last job as CEO. The person who will be replacing him comes from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBitcoin Network Sees Lowest New Addresses Created Since 2018. Despite all the positive news around Bitcoin, not everything is going its way. The new addresses count has declined substantially in the past few weeks and recorded their lowest levels since the bear market in 2018.\n\nCharts\n\nThis week, we have a chart analysis of Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Shiba Inu, and Polkadot \u2013 click here for the complete price analysis."

        "title": "Mauvaise nouvelle pour les sceptiques : les ETFs Ethereum approuv\u00e9s par la SEC - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 24 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is abuzz following the stunning announcement from the SEC: the approval of Ethereum ETFs. This decision, which could redefine institutional investors\u2019 access to digital assets, comes at an important time for the market. While Bitcoin had already paved the way with its own ETFs earlier this year, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is set to gain unprecedented exposure in traditional financial markets.\n\nThe Historical Approval of Ethereum ETFs\n\nLast night, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a decisive step by approving several applications for Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant breakthrough for the second-largest crypto. Among the companies that received SEC approval are financial giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Ark/21Shares, and Invesco/Galaxy. This approval pertains to the 19b-4 forms, essential for setting up these funds, but there remains a crucial step: the approval of the S-1 forms, necessary before the ETFs can be marketed.\n\nJames Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg, highlights the unexpected nature of this decision by stating: \u201cA week ago, I would have said you were a bit crazy to think these ETFs would get SEC approval.\u201d This remark underscores the rapidity and unpredictability of the SEC\u2019s shift in position, which until recently seemed reluctant to engage in discussions with Ethereum ETF issuers.\n\nGrayscale, one of the companies benefiting from this approval, expressed its satisfaction through a spokesperson: \u201cAt Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to collaborate constructively with regulators as they review Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential to bring Ethereum into the U.S. regulatory framework through ETFs.\u201d\n\nTowards a New Investment Paradigm\n\nWhile the approval of the 19b-4 forms suggests a willingness by regulators to allow the commercialization of Ethereum ETFs, it does not guarantee final approval of the S-1 forms. According to James Seyffart, \u201cThere is likely to be a delay before we see S-1 approvals and these ETFs begin trading. My estimate is that it will take at least a week, but probably longer. If history is any guide, it could take much longer and be measured in months.\u201d This statement reflects the uncertainty that still hangs over the exact launch timeline of these new financial products.\n\nIn any case, the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is not only a significant step for the issuers of these products, but it could also have profound repercussions on the crypto market as a whole. This decision follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which quickly attracted $13.3 billion in net inflows, setting performance records for ETFs at their launch. The arrival of Ethereum ETFs could see similar success, attracting a new influx of capital into the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThis SEC turnaround comes amid pro-crypto movements within the U.S. Congress, where several recent votes have shown growing support for crypto-friendly legislation. For example, last week, the Senate passed a resolution to repeal Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, thereby facilitating the offering of cryptocurrency custody services by regulated banks. Additionally, the House of Representatives approved the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which is expected to bring much-needed legal clarity for cryptocurrencies.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum ETF was not expected as soon as it appeared. However, the market's reaction is not what the majority of Ethereum bulls likely expected. In its current state, Ethereum barely moved past the local resistance level and even retraced further.\n\nSo, what's holding Ethereum back?\n\nOnly 19b-4s approved, Not S-1s\n\nThe current approval pertains only to 19b-4s and not the more significant S-1s. In simple terms, this means that while a step has been taken toward greater acceptance, the bigger, more impactful approvals are still pending. The market knows this and is not getting too excited until the S-1s are also greenlit. It is a classic case of the market pricing in expectations \u2014 partial approval is good but not groundbreaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Delegated authority\"\n\nThis ETF approval was handled by the Division of Trading and Markets using \"delegated authority.\" This implies that a commissioner could still challenge the decision within the next 10 days. There is a sense of uncertainty hanging over the market, knowing that this approval might not be the final word. It feels a bit like they are trying to sneak this through, keeping the vote somewhat under the radar due to its political nature.\n\nThese points create a scenario where the Ethereum ETF approval, while positive, is not a guaranteed ticket to the moon. There remains political maneuvering, and further approvals needed to solidify the move. Plus, against the backdrop of broader regulatory and economic uncertainties, investors are playing it safe for now.\n\nDespite the lack of momentum, Ethereum is still looking well positioned for a rally; above numerous key technical resistances, cheap network fees might attract more activity and a fair price level ahead of the major $4,000 threshold."

        "content": "The crypto market is quite susceptible to ETF approvals, as it seems, and the past 24 hours brought even more enhanced volatility for the entire sector.\n\nAfter the hype from the start of the business week settled, the largest cryptocurrencies, including the one that got the green light from the SEC, have turned red.\n\nBTC Drops Below $67,000\n\nThe start of the current business week couldn\u2019t really foresee what was going to happen. BTC had calmed at around $67,000 after the quiet weekend, but it all changed on Monday evening when reports emerged that the SEC could actually greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF by the end of the week.\n\nBitcoin, alongside most of the crypto market, went on a wild ride and soared by five grand in hours. This resulted in tapping its highest price tag in almost two months of nearly $72,000.\n\nThe rally came to a halt at that point and BTC started losing value gradually. Still, it traded in a range around $70,000 until yesterday evening when it slumped by a few grand to under $68,000. This came hours before the SEC\u2019s deadline to make a decision on whether it will approve or reject all ETF applications.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

However, it has lost some ground once again and now struggles below $67,000.\n\nIts market cap is down to $1.310 trillion, and its dominance over the alts is 50.2%.\n\nAlts in Red\n\nThe aforementioned developments around the Ethereum ETFs impacted the underlying asset\u2019s price the most, as expected. ETH skyrocketed by over 20% on Monday to a six-week peak of its own at over $3,900. It also went down and up yesterday ahead of the SEC approval but now sits 4% down on the day at $3,655.\n\nThe rest of the larger-cap alts are in no better state. Solana, Dogecoin, Toncoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Shiba Inu have all dumped by 5-8%. BNB, XRP, TRX, and BCH are also in the red.\n\nThe total crypto market cap has lost over $100 billion since yesterday and is down to $2.617 trillion on CG."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF Approval: How is This Milestone Different to the Bitcoin ETF Approval? - The Fintech Times",
        "content": "The crypto industry has completed another step towards mainstream acceptance as spot Ethereum exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But how is this approval different to Bitcoin\u2019s in January?\n\nOn 23 May 2023, the SEC approved a spot Ethereum ETF meaning that, to begin with, certain investment firms could now offer an ETF of the cryptocurrency. While the SEC still needs to sign off on registration statements for VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and Bitwise, in theory, it shouldn\u2019t be long before these firms can start officially trading Ethereum ETFs.\n\nInterestingly the news comes at a time when the regulator is deciding whether to classify the digital asset as a security. Furthermore, the approval follows more news in the crypto world as the United States House of Representatives voted in favour of legislation to provide greater regulatory clarity over digital assets.\n\nEric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, the trading platform, explains how these discussions fit within the larger picture of cryptocurrencies\u2019 global acceptance: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s approval of the ETH spot ETF, after months of politically driven objections, was overdue but is very welcome. Despite the SEC\u2019s stance that ETH is somehow a security, we are seeing another key part of the crypto industry unlocked for institutional investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yet another sign of how the crypto industry is changing and another step towards crypto rightly being treated the same as any other asset class. This approval means new institutional investors from the US, less volatility, and more evidence for crypto\u2019s long-term future in the world of finance. But let\u2019s be honest: Even a rejection would not have changed much about the positive future for ETH and the entire crypto space.\u201d\n\nAnother milestone in one year?!\n\nEarlier this year, the crypto industry rejoiced as the US regulator announced a huge milestone that many had been calling for: Bitcoin ETFs. As a result of this move, US investors, both institutional and retail, could track the movements of Bitcoin and make purchases without having to set up an account or digital wallet with an unregulated exchange.\n\nWith the newly approved Ethereum ETFs, we set out to find out if this has solidified cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment recognised by the masses, or if they are still viewed as a niche and dangerous investment.\n\nReacting to the SEC\u2019s first stage approval, Alex Saleh, head of partnerships at Coincover, the blockchain protection company comments: \u201cThis is a welcome surprise given the challenges of the Bitcoin ETF approvals and the SEC\u2019s historical hostility towards crypto. The US is the largest market for ETFs in the world, and where the US moves, others usually follow.\n\n\u201cThe launch of Ethereum ETFs still needs to go through a second stage of approval, but if given the green light, would represent a major vote of confidence in the role that digital assets will play in our financial system and open the floodgates to more of these products.\u201d\n\nMore exposure\n\nSaleh continues: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s move is another sign of the growing appetite for crypto ETFs and could introduce fresh demand pressure on Ethereum spot prices, since exposure to Ethereum would be opened to a wider pool of investors.\n\n\u201cWith that said, there is still a lot of uncertainty on the timing of when Ethereum ETF products will hit the market, and which market players will be participating. This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict any changes in demand for the underlying asset that will lead to further price discovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting moment for the crypto community, but there are still risks that come with any new financial instrument. Volatility is a given, and widespread adoption of Ethereum ETFs would lead to fund managers accumulating large amounts of Ethereum across a range of custody methods. This will be a prime target for hacks, attacks, and possible human error. We anticipate greater expectations around risk mitigation and security capabilities, meaning security is paramount and must be a top priority for ETF managers.\u201d\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Bitcoin ETF\n\nDaniel Seifert, UK country director of Coinbase, the global crypto exchange notes how this approval further roots cryptocurrencies in the mainstream world of investing. He says: \u201cCoinbase welcomes this ETF approval and believes it will have a similar, positive impact on the industry, as experienced upon the approval of BTC ETFs.\n\n\u201cThis move solidifies the fact that cryptocurrency is not merely a trend, representing a global transition towards digital assets in order to reshape the existing financial system. The expansion of crypto\u2019s utility will have significant effects on innovation, and we expect to see an escalation of activity in the market. Coinbase is excited to serve asset managers with the full suite of Prime products and further the positive impact on the industry.\u201d\n\nA good step in the right direction but we need to be cautious\n\nMona El Isa, founder of Avantgarde Finance, a crypto asset management firm, explains that while this is a good move for the crypto industry, an ETF takes away some of what makes Ethereum Ethereum.\n\nShe explains: \u201cThe approval of the Ethereum ETF is a positive development, boosting institutional demand as it is packaged in a way that traditional investors understand. However, the risks lie in the details of how these ETFs will implement, monitor, and manage risk, especially if they involve staking Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe centralised nature of these funds contradicts the ethos on which the asset class was built. Owning an ETF makes your investment purely speculative and ironically removes some of the key features that originally drove the popularity of cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThere are also concerning centralisation risks in the current Ethereum staking landscape that need addressing. The top three staking pools control over half the total stake, with a measly 9% left for truly decentralised options. Lido dominates liquid staking with 85% of the market. It\u2019s clear we urgently need new on-chain, decentralised staking alternatives to break up these monopolies.\n\n\u201cWhile ETFs may boost institutional demand short-term, the space must solve these centralisation issues to maintain crypto\u2019s value proposition long-term. The rushed ETF timing also seems more politically motivated than grounded in addressing these crucial risks.\u201d"

They receive rewards for securing the network but incur penalties for poor performance.\n\nCentralization issues have already arisen when some validators seized a significant portion of the staked ETH, with some even comparing the liquidity provider Lido to a \u201ccartel.\u201d\n\nGanesh Swami, CEO of Covalent, explained to Decrypt: \u201cThe removal of the staking clause in ETH ETF authorization applications was intended to appease the SEC. But this short-term solution might cause a long-term problem. If multiple ETFs use the same custodians, it would increase concentration, exposing the network to operational risks such as malicious collusion.\u201d\n\nLack of Regulation and Potential Risks\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States already illustrate the risk of centralization, with Coinbase holding 90% of the total assets. Adding staking could worsen the situation. Andrew O\u2019Neill of S&P Global points out that if ETFs concentrate their participation with a small number of custodians, this could create risks of concentration of crypto validators.\n\nCoinbase, the second-largest Ether validator, is expected to be the custodian for six of the nine companies planning to launch an Ethereum ETF. If the enthusiasm is similar to that of Bitcoin ETFs, this concentration of power could threaten network security.\n\nMona El Isa of Avantgarde Finance explains: \u201cOne can measure the concentration risk by the number of nodes a single entity would need to control the chain. The lower this number, the higher the single point of failure.\u201d\n\nThe SEC views staking as a securities service, which explains its removal from Ethereum ETF applications. However, authorities have not established any guidelines to mitigate the risks of centralization and concentration without staking. The SEC has already sued Kraken and Coinbase to prevent them from offering staking services to U.S. clients.\n\nCrypto experts are therefore calling for heightened vigilance regarding Ethereum ETFs to avoid major security risks. It is crucial for regulators and industry players to collaborate in developing clear guidelines aimed at reducing these potential risks and ensuring the long-term security of the Ethereum network.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "SEC Approves Eight Spot Ethereum ETFs: A Major Milestone for Crypto - Blockchain News",
        "content": "In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved eight spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. This last-minute decision involves major financial players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, Ark, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved the initial forms, the ETF issuers must now get their S-1 registration statements approved before trading can begin. This process, which has just started, could take weeks or even months. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that while it could be completed in a few weeks with intense effort, it often takes three or more months.\n\nA Sudden Shift in SEC\u2019s Stance\n\nUp until recently, it seemed unlikely that the SEC would approve these Ethereum ETFs due to a lack of engagement with issuers. However, this changed abruptly when the SEC began requesting swift submission of necessary forms. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers was urging the SEC to approve the ETFs for consistency and legal clarity. As the likelihood of approval grew, the discount on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust narrowed significantly, indicating positive market anticipation.\n\nThis unexpected shift has led to speculation that political factors might also be at play. Former President Trump has positioned himself as the top choice for crypto supporters, and Democrats have opposed President Biden\u2019s veto threat on SEC-related crypto legislation, which could have resulted in this sudden change of stance on the subject.\n\nInsights from Bitpanda\u2019s CEO Eric Demuth\n\nEric Demuth, co-founder and CEO of Bitpanda, welcomed the SEC\u2019s approval, calling it a long-overdue but very welcome development. He emphasized that despite the SEC\u2019s view of ETH as a security, this approval unlocks a crucial part of the crypto market for institutional investors. Demuth highlighted that this move signifies the evolving landscape of the crypto industry and a step towards treating crypto assets like traditional ones.\n\nDemuth pointed out that the approval opens doors to new institutional investors from the US, potentially leading to less market volatility. He also noted that even if the SEC had rejected the ETF, the positive future for ETH and the broader crypto space would remain unchanged.\n\nComparison with Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs has added significant value, with substantial increases in holdings. However, Ethereum ETFs may face challenges in achieving similar traction. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates that Ethereum ETFs might attract 10 to 15% of the assets that Bitcoin ETFs have, which would still be a strong start.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It not only indicates a shift in regulatory stance but also opens new avenues for institutional investment in Ethereum. This development promises a brighter and more stable future for the crypto industry, heralding a new era of institutional investment and market maturity."

        "content": "The launch of the spot Ethereum ETF on Thursday, May 23, has turned out to be sell-the-news for ETH. As of press time, the Ethereum price is trading 4% down at a price of $3,650 with a market cap of $438 billion. Interestingly, today\u2019s ETH price action coincides with the weekly options expiry.\n\n350,000 Ethereum Options Expire\n\nAccording to data from Greeks.live, approximately 350,000 Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire soon, featuring a Put Call Ratio of 0.58, a Maxpain point of $3,200, and a notional value of $1.3 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH has recently outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s rally, spurred by advancements in ETF developments. This surge led to a remarkable 20% increase in a single day. Short-term option Implied Volatility (IV) peaked at 150% at one stage, significantly surpassing the current IV of Bitcoin for the equivalent period.\n\nPresently, a noticeable divergence between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) is evident. Analysis of block trading and market trading structures indicates sustained bullish sentiment for ETH. However, maintaining consistently high IV levels for each major term is proving challenging. As a result, employing calendar spreads may be a more favorable strategy moving forward.\n\nJust ahead of the Ethereum ETF approval on Thursday, the ETH price saw high volatility leading to more than $132 million in long liquidations.\n\nETH Exchange Wallet Deposits Rise\n\nIn an analysis provided by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the rising number of Ethereum ($ETH) deposits into cryptocurrency exchange wallets suggests a potential scenario of either a sell-off or an increase in ETH profit-taking activity. Additionally, the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator is signaling a sell signal on Ethereum\u2019s daily chart.\n\nThe present green nine candlestick on the daily chart indicates a potential surge in selling pressure, which could prompt a retracement lasting between one to four daily candlesticks, or potentially initiate a new downward countdown phase before the uptrend resumes.\n\nThe recent Ethereum price correction provides a buy-the-dip opportunity for long-term holders. Although the SEC has approved 19b-4 filings for Ethereum ETF, they have yet to clear the S1 registration which will take a few more weeks for the Ethereum ETF to start trading on exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waiting time until the listing takes place, and then the inflow will provide whether there\u2019s a strong continuation upwards\u201d, writes crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

He is a professor, contributor and advisor at different universities, particularly at the IVY League. He serves in diplomacy as advisor to United Nations higher officials and as a member of the diplomatic staff of several governments. He has received high honours from Russian Federation, United States or Peru. LESS ... MORE\n\nCryptocurrency has taken over the world as a means of investment and exchange of valuable goods and services.\n\nThis comes as the first approval or endorsement of any spot ETF related to ethereum by the SEC, a development that marks a turning point in the crypto market. This highly significant decision affects the Ethereum, which is the second largest cryptocurrency based on its market capitalization, and indicates a rising trend toward the adoption of cryptocurrencies within institutions.\n\nEthereum is an open source blockchain platform created in 2015 by Vatalik Buterin and a group of developers collecting funds through an ICO that allows for creating smart contract and decentralized application (DApp). Secondly, Ethereum is not aimed exclusively at being digital money like Bitcoin, the blockchain of Ethereum can be used for a vast number of other applications and services. It has an indigenous coin, Ether (ETH), which serves as a medium of exchange within the network.\n\nExchange Traded Fund or ETF is a division of investment that is similar to a stock, as it is publicly traded in the exchange market. This is normally in form of indexes; thus when one is investing they are bound to make investment on a certain asset or a set of assets. A spot ETF own the physical underlying asset contrary to a Futures ETF where you trade in futures contracts hence gives the investor a direct take on the price swings in the actual asset.\n\nTo that end, it is pertinent to note that the approval of an Ethereum spot ETF by the SEC is in more ways than one beneficial.\n\nFirst, this approval signifies a transition to the recognition of the cryptocurrencies as investments. Family offices and institutional investors who may have not invested in cryptocurrencies or digital assets in the past owing to regulatory issues have now been given a more trusted and regulated way of acquiring Ethereum.\n\nSecond, the decision made by the SEC indicates that the use and popularity of cryptocurrency is already at the level when all necessary measures have been taken to provide a high level of security and ensure that all the necessary rules will be followed by the participants of the market. This may open up the potential for more cryptocurrencies instrument in the future so as to exponentially fuel the Cryptocurrency financial market.\n\nThird, the Ethereum spot ETF helps investors diversify their market portfolios with the cryptocurrencies without having to begin owning and trading the assets on their own. This makes it convenient for the retail investors and increases the eligible group for investors.\n\nAnd fourth, the approval is likely to lead major capital testing on Ethereum, as both individual and institutional investors will look for the possibilities of investing in this new product. This could increase the demand and liquidity, which in turn could increase the value of Ether, the token Ethereum uses.\n\nIt has been quite a lengthy process to get to this point where there may be a possibility of having an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nSEC has turned nos for cryptocurrency when it comes to regulating new financial products that are based on such coins due to issues such as manipulation, fluctuating prices amongst other issues that would likely harm investors.\n\nStill, as the market for cryptocurrencies became more complex and standard-setting bodies drew up stricter measures to combat fraudulent securities, these issues are now not as significant.\n\nSeveral companies tried to have Ethereum spot ETFs in circulation through the years, and with each attempt, they put better measures addressing transparency, security, and compliance in place. The defensive stance taken by the SEC has ensured that the approved product only offers the investors the best according to the hue standards it set for the markets.\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum spot ETF may help extend the adoption of cryptocurrencies to more businesses and investors than before.\n\nFirst of all, it establishes the criteria for the recognition of other crypto funds, including altcoins and new technologies for obtaining blocks. It can help create more regulations in the future by providing investors with a clearer regulatory picture of the sector.\n\nSecond, as digital currencies adjust to conventional markets, one can assume that the latter has a great potential for expanding to the mainstream level. This could result in increased adoption of the use of digital currencies, in general and everyday usage, and the aspect diversification in the financial sector.\n\nAnd third, with a spot ETF to Ethereum instituted, more financial institutions are likely to follow suit to offer similar ETFs, which in the end results in increased competition that would be as a result of reduced fees as well as better services for the investors in Ethereum.\n\nBoth of them, however, shared a common idea that the approval of the spot ETF by the SEC will have a beneficial effect on the development of the Ethereum cryptocurrency investment.\n\nHence, digital asset investing has become more mainstream and a new way to access the rapidly emerging market has been created for anyone willing to enter the world of cryptocurrencies. This advancement must be seen in the context of the ever increasing acceptance of blockchain technology to traditional financial practices proving that this is only the tip of the iceberg of what lies in store for the financial system.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own."

        "title": "Bull Run or Major Correction for Ethereum (ETH) After the ETF Approvals? Analysts Chip in - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) surged over 20% this week, nearing $4,000, driven by hopes of SEC approval for spot ETH ETFs. Nonetheless, the official green light led to significant market volatility and a price drop.\n\nAnalysts are divided on ETH\u2019s future, with some predicting a major price increase and others expecting short-term corrections. Key indicators hint at a potential incoming rally.\n\nETH\u2019s Next Potential Move\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been among the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past week, with its price surging by over 20% and briefly nearing the $4,000 mark. Its rally was triggered by the reemerged hopes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had changed its tune on whether to approve or deny the ETF applications.\n\nThe greenlight became official several hours ago, but instead of an additional price boost, it propelled massive volatility in the entire cryptocurrency sector, with ETH entering red territory.\n\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the market reacted quite similarly in January this year when the American securities regulator gave its thumbs up on spot BTC ETFs.\n\nSeveral analysts gave their two cents on the hot topic, with most describing the move as a major bullish factor for the entire cryptocurrency industry. One person sharing that thesis is the popular investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano.\n\nThe X user CryptoYoddha chipped in, too, claiming that \u201cEthereum doesn\u2019t care if they approve the ETFs or not.\u201d The analyst provided a chart according to which the asset\u2019s value is projected to surpass the $13K mark sometime next year, assuming this will coincide with the bull cycle\u2019s top.\n\nHowever, not all are that optimistic. Ali Martinez touched upon the matter shortly before the SEC\u2019s green light, suggesting that the TD Sequential \u201cpresents a sell signal on Ethereum\u2019s daily chart.\u201d As such, he anticipates \u201ca one to four daily candlesticks correction for ETH.\u201d\n\nTD Sequential is an important indicator developed by Tom DeMark. It is used to identify potential points of trend exhaustion and reversal in financial and crypto markets. It is based on consecutive bars closing higher or lower.\n\nWhat Are Other Metrics Signaling?\n\nA major element that could give a hint about ETH\u2019s next price movement is open interest. The indicator refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled for Ethereum and is used to gauge the market\u2019s sentiment.\n\nRecently, the metric hit an all-time high, suggesting that significant price swings in both directions could be on the horizon.\n\nAnother indicator worth observing is Ethereum\u2019s exchange netflow, which has been negative in the past two days. Such a shift from centralized platforms to self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.\n\nLast but not least, we will touch upon the Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to ETH. The indicator measures the speed and change of price movements and ranges from 0 to 100. A ratio above 70 signals that the asset may be overbought and could be due for a correction. Latest data shows that RSI stands at around 52."

A whale withdrew 1,600 ETH, worth approximately $6.2 million, from Bybit and Cooper accounts. This notable movement was complemented by a second transaction involving $740,000 worth of ETH. These substantial transfers have caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community, raising questions about their potential impact on the market and the motives behind such large-scale movements.\n\nETH Whale Accumulation Driving Price Action\n\nIn the last few hours, there has been notable activity by Fasanara Capital, an investment fund based in England.

        "content": "Despite the recent regulatory nod for the Spot Ethereum ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ethereum\u2019s price has dipped. Notably, the recent drop in price reflects that the investors are taking a cautious approach before putting their bets. However, amid this, a prominent crypto analyst has outlined several factors that could influence Ethereum\u2019s performance in the coming days, predicting a potential dip to around $3.4K.\n\nAnalyst Unveils Potential ETH Movements\n\nProminent crypto market expert, Ali Martinez, recently examined Ethereum\u2019s market movements and provided some insights. He noted that substantial transfers of ETH to exchanges are raising eyebrows. This activity has spurred speculation about potential profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or mere market speculation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBesides, adding to the concern, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilke recently transferred 10,000 ETH, worth approximately $37.38 million, to the Kraken exchange. This significant transfer could indicate a potential sell-off, which might trigger price volatility.\n\nAccording to Spot On Chain data, Wilke\u2019s move is part of a broader trend where over 242,000 ETH have been transferred to exchange wallets in the past two weeks. Notably, it also adds to the spike in Ethereum trading activity in recent days.\n\nMeanwhile, Martinez also pointed out that the TD Sequential indicator is flashing a sell signal on Ethereum\u2019s daily chart. This indicator, known for predicting market trends, suggests that ETH might face selling pressure. He said that the green nine candlestick on the daily chart could lead to a price retracement or even a new downward phase before any potential uptrend resumes.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum-beta Ondo Finance (ONDO) Price Touches New All-Time High, What\u2019s Cooking?\n\nKey Ethereum Price Levels\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, a significant number of Ethereum addresses could provide crucial support if the price dips further. Around 1.81 million addresses bought about 1.66 million ETH between $3,820 and $3,700.\n\nThe analyst suggests that this range could act as a buffer against increasing selling pressure. However, if Ethereum\u2019s price falls below this zone, the next support level lies between $3,580 and $3,462. Notably, in this range, 3.13 million addresses were acquired over 1.50 million ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, the critical resistance barrier for Ethereum stands between $3,940 and $4,054. More than 1.16 million addresses previously purchased around 574,660 ETH in this range. If Ethereum can surpass this resistance and close above $4,170, it could invalidate the bearish outlook and potentially initiate a new upward trend toward $5,000.\n\nMeanwhile, according to market experts, the Ether ETF could propel an Ethereum price rally in the long run, as seen in the Bitcoin performance after the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. However, despite this, the pundits have warned about potential volatility in the short-term, where several investors might book profit given the recent surge in ETH price.\n\nAs of writing, Ethereum price slipped about 4.5% and exchanged hands at $3,659.16, with its trading volume soaring 93.23% to $47.91 billion. Over the last 30 days, the second-largest crypto by market cap saw a high of $3,943.55 and a low of $2,815.92. Notably, the Ethereum Open Interest slumped 5.90% to $15.33 billion amid the price dip, CoinGlass data showed.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Community Mourns As Iconic Dog \u2018Kabosu\u2019 Passes Away At 17\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "Sat 25 May 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nEthereum at $100,000? Billy Markus strongly believes it! The co-founder of Dogecoin, also known by the pseudonym Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has shaken the crypto community by predicting this spectacular value for ether (ETH). This bold forecast comes at a time when crypto markets are in full swing. If this prediction were to come true, it could transform the digital economy and redefine the limits of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nBilly Markus\u2019s prediction\n\nBilly Markus made a resounding statement regarding ether, the native crypto of Ethereum. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Markus asserted that he would like to see the asset hit the $100,000 mark. This statement did not go unnoticed, as it reflects a bold ambition for the crypto currently ranked second in market capitalization. Markus revealed that his goal would be to use these gains to buy a house in Los Angeles.\n\nIn his message, Markus outlined the conditions necessary for this prediction to become a reality. He mentioned that to reach such a peak, Ethereum would need to benefit from massive adoption and significant scalability improvements. He also highlighted the importance of Ethereum network updates, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0, aimed at enhancing the network\u2019s security and efficiency. This statement sparked lively discussions within the crypto community. Some experts see this as a distant but plausible possibility, while others remain skeptical about such a valuation.\n\nThe consequences of such a price for Ethereum\n\nValuing ether at $100,000 would have profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem and beyond. Firstly, such a valuation would place the crypto at the pinnacle of digital assets. Its market capitalization would reach $12 trillion, surpassing many major traditional companies. This would bolster institutional investor confidence, attracting massive funds towards ether and other cryptocurrencies. This influx of capital could stimulate innovation and the development of new decentralized applications (dApps), further strengthening Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSecondly, the skyrocketing value of ether would significantly impact Ethereum network users and developers. Ether (ETH) holders would see their investments appreciate considerably, potentially increasing the adoption and use of the currency for various transactions and financial applications.\n\nDevelopers would also be encouraged to create more projects on the Ethereum blockchain, taking advantage of the network\u2019s increased stability and security. Additionally, the price surge could accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional economy, forcing regulators to create clearer legislative frameworks and recognize the growing importance of digital assets in the global financial system.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum ETF To Mirror Damage Caused By Sam Bankman-Fried & CZ: Better Markets - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a bold move, Better Markets, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the public interest in financial markets, has launched a scathing critique of the recent approval of Spot Spot Ethereum ETFs. It criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approving the Ethereum ETFs. Better Markets\u2019 Director of Securities Policy, Benjamin Schiffrin, minced no words in his condemnation.\n\nBetter Markets Criticizes The Approval Of Ethereum ETFs\n\nSchiffrin labeled the move as a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d that would only exacerbate the risks faced by investors in the volatile crypto industry. Moreover, Schiffrin\u2019s statement comes hot on the heels of the SEC\u2019s approval of proposed rule changes allowing national securities exchanges to list and trade shares in Spot Ether ETPs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe decision has raised significant concerns within the financial community. The reason for such concerns lies in the recent indictments and convictions related to fraudulent activities in the crypto space. \u201cToday the SEC doubled down on its historic mistake of approving spot bitcoin ETPs,\u201d Schiffrin lamented.\n\nIn addition, he highlighted the dangers posed by investing in assets like ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum network. Moreover, he pointed to recent cases as evidence of the inherent risks associated with Spot Ethereum ETFs. He spotlighted the indictment of two brothers for exploiting the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars in cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIn our original and supplemental comment letters, we highlighted the reasons why the proposed rule changes to list and trade shares in spot ether ETPs should have been rejected,\u201d Schiffrin explained. He emphasized the volatility of Ether as an asset and the vulnerabilities of the Ethereum network to fraud and manipulation. Furthermore, he warned that the approval of Spot Ether ETPs would only serve to endanger retail investors and threaten the broader financial system.\n\nAlso Read: Top 4 ETH-Based Meme Coins That Could Soar with an Ethereum ETF\n\nStatement Against Sam Bankman-Fried & CZ\n\nFurthermore, the involvement of prominent figures like Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, and Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, further underscores the concerns raised by Better Markets. Both individuals have faced legal troubles in recent months. Bankman-Fried was convicted of stealing billions of dollars and CZ pleading guilty to money laundering.\n\nAccording to the court rulings, Bankman-Fried got 64 months in prison. Whilst, Binance\u2019s CZ got 4 months in prison, however, it\u2019s unclear if he has started serving the sentence. Better Markets believes that Ethereum ETFs could pose similar threats to the financial system as seen in the above-mentioned cases.\n\nHowever, Better Markets has attracted backlash for this statement. Nate Geraci, the host of ETF Prime, highlighted the unprecedented shift in the SEC and Biden administration\u2019s stance on crypto. He noted that Better Markets might not be aware of the abrupt shift. In a sarcastic tone, Geraci stated, \u201cBetter Markets apparently didn\u2019t get the memo from DC to shift stance on crypto.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Forecast: $80,000 Per BTC Looms As Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "ETH Price Struggles to Surge Even After Ethereum ETF Approval, Sell The News Soon? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Following the approval of eight spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, May 23, the price of Ether (ETH) has remained stagnant at $3,800, showing no significant signs of an upward trend.\n\nDespite this, ETH has experienced a notable rally of over 30% in the past week. Investors are currently adopting a cautious stance, observing whether this development will result in a \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Shows Major Volatility\n\nAhead of the U.S. SEC announcing its decision to spot Ethereum ETF approval, the ETH price witnessed some wild swings. In the tense hour preceding the official approval, ETH initially dropped to $3,500 around the time of the traditional U.S. market close.\n\nSubsequently, it surged close to $3,900 upon the emergence of initial unconfirmed reports suggesting approval, ultimately settling above $3,800 after confirmation. Amid these massive price fluctuations, it turns out that a whale sold a staggering 7,900 ETH holdings worth $29 million.\n\nDuring the turbulent episode, liquidations of leveraged crypto derivative positions surged to over $350 million throughout the day, marking the highest figure since May 1, according to CoinGlass data.\n\nThe majority of these liquidated positions were longs anticipating price increases, totaling approximately $250 million. This indicates that traders who had overextended themselves with leverage were taken by surprise by the abrupt price drop. Among the affected, ETH traders bore the brunt, with $132 million in liquidations.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead?\n\nThe approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs could drive more than $500 million in inflows as predicted by analysts. However, this might take some time to realize and kickstart the uptrend.\n\nSeveral on-chain indicators have been pointing out that Ethereum can easily form a base above $4,000 and can continue rallying to $5,000-$6,000 up until August this year.\n\nWhile the approval of the Bitcoin ETFs led to strong institutional inflows, it will be interesting to see whether the Ether ETF launch could lead to greater institutional adoption.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "'Guild of Guardians' Review: The Perfect Ethereum Game to Play While Taking a Poo - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGames have to find you at the right time. Well, this Ethereum game found me on the toilet.\n\nMy favorite gaming experiences have come when a game is enjoyable and perfectly fits into my life. Think Bloodborne finding me cooped up inside during the pandemic, or co-op gem It Takes Two when I wanted to bond with my partner.\n\nGuild of Guardians meets you in those natural breaks in your day\u2014as you're taking a suspiciously long toilet break at work, waiting for the bus, or cooking dinner. This mobile fantasy game has enough complexity to keep you interested, yet thankfully packs a quick enough gameplay loop to easily pick up and put down.\n\nScreenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFight through dungeons\n\nGuild of Guardians is a mobile trading card game on iOS and Android that draws from the rogue-lite and auto-battler genres for an addictive and convenient gameplay experience.\n\nYou'll battle your way through dungeons, completing each one up to three times for maximum experience points and loot so that you can continue upgrading your squad. Every dungeon has multiple rooms full of enemies that you need to battle in order to get the final reward. Each room likewise has a range of enemies, loot boxes, and the odd neutral ground to heal or level up your gear.\n\nYou start off being able to field three guardians, gradually adding more as you level up. These range from tanks to mages and support guardians, and it's critical to make sure your squad has a balanced combination of attributes. Once you\u2019ve picked your party of guardians, you\u2019ll carefully select your formation, ensuring to put the tanks at the front\u2014and then click fight.\n\nTaking inspiration from auto-battlers like Riot\u2019s Teamfight Tactics (TFT), your guardians will fight automatically for you. In Guild of Guardians, however, you choose when each one casts their ultimate ability. This strikes a great balance between being passive enough to play in the natural lulls of your day while still being engaging\u2014and requiring at least a little attention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScreenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.\n\nAs you pass through the rooms of each dungeon, you\u2019re asked to select a rune which will give you a slight buff going forward. Sometimes you have the misfortune of picking up a \u201ccurse of fate,\u201d which will buff your enemy and make them more powerful. This gives enough variety to each run of a dungeon, as I adjust my strategy based on my squad and the runes I\u2019ve picked up.\n\nThis whole loop doesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes at a time, with lots of downtime to put the phone down, continue on with real life, and then return. This is why it\u2019s perfect for those natural pauses in your day.\n\nMy only complaint when it comes to the core gameplay is that \u201cdomain synergies\u201d\u2014and how they interact with each other\u2014feel hidden. Even once you search it out, it doesn\u2019t feel wholly clear or unique. It appears that having a number of characters from the same \u201cdomain\u201d slightly buffs your team, but the buff is fairly similar for each domain\u2026 so it feels slightly redundant.\n\nIn other auto-battlers, this is often the most interesting part of the game\u2014so I\u2019d love to see Guild of Guardians develop out some complexity here, such as synergies that grant healing, the ability to stun, or something else unique.\n\nPimp out your party\n\nAfter completing a few dungeons, you\u2019ve probably collected enough resources to start really crafting a team that works for you.\n\nGuild of Guardians has a pretty extensive character leveling and gear system that takes just as much as, if not more attention than the dungeon clearing. Each guardian has its own level going up to 30, which influences their health, attack, defense, as well as what skills they have available to unlock.\n\nOn top of this, you\u2019re able to equip each character with gear such as armor, a wizard hat, or an ax to boost certain statistics. This all feels pretty intuitive, and when it\u2019s not, the game thankfully holds your hand through it.\n\nScreenshot from Guild of Guardians. Image: Guild of Guardians.\n\nUntil this point, I had not interacted with any crypto or NFT elements. I\u2019d played the game every day for almost a week, progressing through the game just fine without any Web3 components. Once you sign into your Immutable Passport wallet, however, using a simple Gmail sign-in option, new benefits come your way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost notably, you\u2019re able to \u201cascend\u201d your guardians, which gives them a 30% boost across the board. By doing this, you\u2019re turning the guardian into an NFT on the Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM, allowing you to sell them on the secondary marketplace.\n\nYou can currently purchase the resources required to ascend a guardian for $6.99 for 40 Ascension Seals, but you can also earn them by topping leaderboards. How many seals are required varies depending on how popular the guardian is\u2014but from what I saw, 31 Ascension Seals would do the job for most purple-rarity guardians.\n\nBefore doing this, Guild of Guardians game director Chris Clay encouraged me during a Zoom call to level my guardians up as much as possible. Ascending your guardians should be the last step in powering up your guardian, and a way for you to lock in the value you\u2019ve put into the game.\n\nAs someone who has put countless hours (as well as a painful amount of money) into games that give nothing back, I like the idea of being able to sell my assets when I decide I don\u2019t want to play anymore\u2014the Web3 element of this game enables that.\n\nGuild of Guardians has a brilliantly addictive gameplay loop. You\u2019ll dive into dungeons attempting to get all the loot at the end. Failed to make it there? Then use any loot you can find to level up your squad, craft gear, or unlock new guardians to take you to that next level.\n\nNow when I\u2019m sitting on the throne, I\u2019m not doom-scrolling on Twitter. I\u2019m leveling up my guardians, fighting skeletons in the dungeons, and grinding to one day ascend my whole party in Guild of Guardians.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Ethereum ETF approval drives positive sentiment, but questions about S-1 registrations loom.\n\nDespite growing price, the overall activity on the Ethereum network declined.\n\nEthereum [ETH] witnessed a massive uptick in price due to the Ethereum ETF being approved. However, there could be some problems that ETH could face in the future.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nAccording to Delphi Digital\u2019s analysis, The SEC currently has only approved the 19b-4s listing requests for ETH ETFs, not the critical S-1 registration statements.\n\nFor context, S-1 is a key document for ETFs, acting like a prospectus, detailing investment strategy, risks, and financials. SEC approval of the S-1 is mandatory for an ETF to trade.\n\nThe details\n\nThere are a couple of possible reasons for the SEC\u2019s split approval. Delegated approval suggests potential political influence. This means that the approval may have been influenced by political considerations rather than by a careful review of the merits of the ETF proposals.\n\nSome also believe that approval of 19b-4s might be a trade-off for passing ESG rules. ESG rules are environmental, social, and governance rules.\n\nThe SEC may have approved the 19b-4s listing requests in order to get approval for ESG rules. For clarification, 19b-4s is a form for rule changes by exchanges (like listing new products).\n\nSEC approval allows the exchange to consider listing the new product (e.g., ETH ETF), but doesn\u2019t directly authorize the ETF itself.\n\nIt is unlikely that the S-1s will be approved anytime soon. This is because there is still a lot of uncertainty about the regulation of cryptocurrency ETFs. The SEC may be waiting for more guidance from Congress or for the courts to weigh in on the issue.\n\nEven though there may be some time left for Ethereum ETFs to become fully operational in the open market, crypto traders have reacted extremely positively to this news.\n\nThe price of ETH grew by 22% over the last and the currency was trading at $3,691.32 at the time of writing. Apart from the hype that is driving the price of Ethereum, the overall state of the network will also play a crucial role in ETH\u2019s long-term trajectory.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, the number of daily active addresses on the Ethereum network had fallen significantly. Coupled with that the number of NFT trades occurring on the network had also fallen.\n\nThis declining interest in the network could impact ETH materially going forward."

        "content": "By Yi Whan-woo\n\nKorean financial regulators are under growing pressure to approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for crypto assets, after the U.S. securities regulator gave the green light on creation of ETFs for ethereum, Thursday (local time).\n\nThe decision made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) concerning ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, comes after the SEC allowed bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency to be traded as ETFs in January.\n\nETFs are baskets of securities that are only available for trading on the traditional securities market.\n\nIn that regard, the SEC\u2019s measures in favor of bitcoin and ethereum mark a significant shift in lowering the barriers between the traditional finance and digital asset industries.\n\nIn a stark contrast, Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) are hesitant to open the door for trading crypto assets on the traditional securities market.\n\nCiting the Capital Markets Act, the FSC said ETFs deal only with underlying assets, which refers to the real financial assets or the security that a financial derivative is based on. These include international currencies and commodities.\n\n\u201cUnder the circumstances, the SEC\u2019s Thursday decision on ethereum is anticipated to press Seoul\u2019s financial regulators to reconsider its regulations against digital assets,\u201d said Xangle, a Seoul-based data and information provider on digital currencies.\n\nIt called the ban on digital assets in the traditional securities market \u201coutdated,\u201d especially considering the government committed to boosting the undervalued Seoul stock market in the name of tackling the so-called \u201cKorea discount.\u201d\n\nA rigid regulatory policy is considered a reason behind lower valuation of the Korean stocks compared to global peers.\n\nJung Eui-jung, head of the Korean Stockholders\u2019 Alliance, reckoned following the U.S. path and endorsing ETFs for bitcoin and ethereum is critical \u201cin order to ensure that investors, both in traditional finance and digital assets, do not exit Korea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho would want to invest their money in a market that lags behind the fast-changing regulatory landscape?\u201d Jung said.\n\nHe warned that investors may pull out their cash to invest in the U.S. markets instead if the Seoul regulators \u201ccontinue to make little progress while the U.S. takes bigger strides and moves forward\u201d on digital assets.\n\n\u201cIt will be a matter of time for the U.S. to fully open the door for other less-traded cryptocurrencies and that Korea at least should approve ETFs for bitcoin and ethereum,\u201d Jung added.\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), in line with April general election pledgees, is anticipated to address a need to lower barriers on digital assets when the next National Assembly begins.\n\nSeparately, FSS Governor Lee Bok-hyun deemed that the mood for a public discussion on whether to allow cryptocurrencies in the traditional finance may be set up in the second half of the year."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs May Propel ETH to Record Highs, Says Bitwise CIO - CoinGape",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2018s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has set the stage for potential new all-time highs for Ethereum (ETH). Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise, predicts that investor inflows into these ETFs will drive ETH beyond its previous peak of about $4,900, reached in November 2021.\n\nEthereum ETFs Approval to Attract Billions in Inflows\n\nEarlier this week, the SEC approved a rule change that paved the way for spot market Ethereum ETFs. Following this, the regulatory agency approved Ethereum ETF issuers. Hougan predicts that investor inflows into ETH ETFs will amount to billions of dollars. He believes this influx will significantly impact the market, potentially pushing ETH to new record highs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn an interview on the Bankless podcast, Hougan emphasized that although Ethereum ETFs might not match Bitcoin ETFs in terms of inflows, they will still attract substantial investment. He noted that Bitcoin ETFs saw $12 billion in inflows within the first four months. Hougan expects Ethereum ETFs to achieve less than half of that but more than a quarter, indicating significant demand for these financial products.\n\nHougan Predicts Growth in Crypto ETFs\n\nHougan also believes that ETFs with exposure to multiple digital assets will launch in the future, meeting diverse investor needs. He envisions a market where a mix of Bitcoin-only, ETH-only, and multi-asset ETFs will coexist. This diversity will cater to different investor preferences, from those seeking the high returns of Ethereum to those looking for a balanced crypto portfolio.\n\nHougan argues that the launch of multiple crypto asset ETFs will benefit the market as a whole. He predicts that about 30% of the market will be Bitcoin-only, 50% a mix, and 20% ETH-only. This variety will make the market feel more robust and real, providing investors with more options and boosting overall confidence in the sector.\n\nHougan is optimistic about the future of crypto ETFs and their impact on the market. He believes that professional investors seeking high-returning assets will find Ethereum particularly attractive. This interest will further drive demand for ETH-focused ETFs, contributing to Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach new heights.\n\nMoreover, the introduction of diverse ETFs will enhance market stability. With more investment options available, the market will likely experience increased participation and engagement. Hougan\u2019s predictions underscore the potential for significant growth and stability in the crypto market as it evolves to include a wider range of ETF offerings.\n\nAlso Read: Tom Emmer Slams Elizabeth Warren Amid Pro-Crypto Lawmakers Triumph\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Algorand, the blockchain protocol, has released an attention-grabbing ad campaign aimed directly at Ethereum and Solana, two considerable rivals in the crypto world. In the context of the ad, customers are trying to pay with different cryptocurrencies in a supermarket environment.\n\nBitcoin was said to be slow, with one of the customers being told that it may take up to 27 minutes for the funds to go through. When trying to settle Ethereum payments, users were stunned by the outrageously high fees that they had to pay; at the same time, attempts at Solana payments were simply refused time and again.\n\nOn the other hand, Algorand\u2019s own token, known as ALGO, was processed quickly and without any hitches witnessed earlier in the exercise, thereby underscoring Algorand\u2019s claimed value propositions of superior efficiency and speed for real-world use cases.\n\nThe campaign was launched at a time when Algorand is seeking to strengthen its ground and take users from other blockchains. According to data from DeFiLlama, Algorand currently has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $92.6 million, which is actually lower than Ethereum and Solana.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAlgorand\u2019s native token ALGO has experienced a 2.54% price decline. As of now, the token is trading at $0.1804 following Coinmarketcap stats. This price change shows that there is uncertainty in the effect of this advertising campaign on the Algorand market volatility."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana lost around 10% of its value in an unexpected manner. The asset that looked well-positioned for the rally after the preliminary approval of the Ethereum ETF is currently looking weaker than the rest of the market, and it's not clear if it's going to recover properly.\n\nExamining the chart, Solana experienced a sharp decline, dropping from around $176 to $164. This significant drop has brought SOL down to test its support level at $160, which has previously acted as a strong support area. If this level fails to hold, the next major support lies at $150, corresponding with the 200-day moving average (orange line).\n\nOn the resistance side, Solana faces immediate resistance at $176, a level it struggled to maintain before the recent drop. Above this, the next key resistance is around $190, where the 50-day moving average (blue line) currently resides. Breaking through these levels would be necessary for any substantial recovery.\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to Solana's decline. First, market sentiment following the Ethereum ETF approval has been mixed, with some assets benefiting while others like Solana suffer. Additionally, technical factors such as failing to maintain key resistance levels might have triggered stop-loss orders, accelerating the sell-off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor traders and investors, the $160 support level is critical. If Solana can maintain this level, it may consolidate and attempt another upward move. However, if it breaks below $160, the next significant level to watch would be $150. This could indicate further downside potential, and investors might need to brace for more volatility.\n\nEthereum stays composed\n\nThe expected kick in price that many attributed to Ethereum's ETF effect turned out to be a fiasco. There are quite a number of factors that could be responsible for bringing out such poor price performance, although, for the time being, the more important question remains: could there be price growth ahead, rather than talks about the failed rally?\n\nEthereum, until this point in time, had not been able to really breach key resistance levels, even after ETF approval. Critical reasons behind this are the kind of approval \u2014 it was not the full-blown S-1 type \u2014 and, hence, the doors for further regulatory issues are still open.\n\nBesides, the Division of Trading and Markets gave this consent under delegated authority, which is subject to challenge over the next 10 days. All this amounts to some additional uncertainty that adds to the overall position of the markets.\n\nBut it is not all bad over the long term. The plain fact that any acceptance of an Ethereum ETF, even partial, sets a precedent in this space and sets off further potential and larger instances of crypto adoption.\n\nCardano's weird position\n\nCardano is not the most noted asset in the market, does not bring much volatility and, therefore, did not form very noticeable moves in previous weeks. However, we can see some potential here because ADA is approaching a major support, which can afterwards serve as a base for a reverse.\n\nAt this point, the chart is showing Cardano establishing a new level of support around $0.45. This level has been tested several times and has held up under the pressure of the downside, perhaps pointing to some real interest in that price. The volume spike on this new movement definitely strengthens the case for this to be an important level for the price. If ADA can hold onto this level, it might serve as a nice base upon which to initiate an upward move.\n\nOn a daily chart, ADA has its immediate resistance located at $0.50. This is a price level at which the ticker has seen rejections in the onward price action for the last couple of days. One critical thing to note is that once breached, the current fanatical rally could see a target at $0.55, exactly where the 200-day moving average lies."

This marks a significant milestone for the Layer 2 scaling startup. In a notable message embedded within the block, Buterin expressed his enthusiasm for Taiko\u2019s launch and the broader implications for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nVitalik Buterin On Taiko Mainnet\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see that Taiko is launching as a based rollup,\u201d Buterin wrote, according to the message on the Taiko mainnet block. Moreover, he highlighted the innovative approach Taiko is taking. Furthermore, he continued, \u201cEthereum benefits from L2s taking a plurality of different approaches, and I appreciate them being among the first to go in this direction.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nTaiko aims to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues by making transactions cheaper while preserving the network\u2019s core attributes of being censorship-resistant, permissionless, and secure. The startup is developing a \u201cType 1\u201d ZK-EVM, a ZK-rollup that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and supports zero-knowledge proof computation.\n\nIn addition, he this technology allows for more efficient and secure transaction processing without compromising on decentralization or security. Hence, the launch of Taiko as a ZK-rollup represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions.\n\nBy leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, Taiko can offer scalable and cost-effective transactions, which are crucial for the widespread adoption of decentralized applications. Moreover, Buterin\u2019s endorsement underscores the importance of diverse approaches in the Ethereum Layer 2 space, which are essential for the network\u2019s long-term success and sustainability.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF To Mirror Damage Caused By Sam Bankman-Fried & CZ: Better Markets\n\nTaiko Genesis Airdrop\n\nEarlier, Taiko revealed plans for an airdrop targeting its community members prior to its mainnet debut. This initiative, called the \u201cgenesis airdrop,\u201d will see 5% of the total 1 billion token supply distributed.\n\nCommunity members eligible for the initial airdrop include those who have engaged with the Taiko testnet. In addition, those who served as block proposers and provers, contributed to specific GitHub repositories, and participants in the Ethereum ICO are also eligible.\n\nThe token distribution for Taiko involves 48.5% allocated to significant stakeholders. Out of this, 20% is designated for Taiko Labs and its core team, 16.88% for the Taiko Foundation reserves, and 11.62% for investors. Additionally, the DAO Treasury will receive 20% of the tokens.\n\nOther allocations include 5% for Grants and RetroPGF, 5% for liquidity and market making, and 10% for the Trailblazer airdrop, which is separate from the genesis airdrop. Moreover, the TKO genesis airdrop can be claimed once the Taiko Layer 2 mainnet becomes operational.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Receives $1M Starknet Grant, STRK Price Soars 3%\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
