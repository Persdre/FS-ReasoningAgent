        "title": "Cryptocurrency Price Prediction: Bitcoin $110,000, Ethereum $6,000 and O2T $100 Before Q4 2024 - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "Dubai, UAE, April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As we navigate through the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, the horizon is bright with predictions of substantial growth for leading tokens. Among these, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the innovative newcomer Option2Trade (O2T) are set to experience remarkable surges in their value. With industry experts forecasting Bitcoin to hit $110,000, Ethereum to reach $6,000, and O2T to skyrocket to $100 before the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto community is buzzing with anticipation. This article delves into the factors behind these bold predictions and what they mean for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC): The Trailblazer's Trajectory to $110,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) , the original cryptocurrency, has always been a bellwether for the market. Its journey from a novel idea to a global financial phenomenon is nothing short of spectacular. The prediction of Bitcoin (BTC) reaching $110,000 is rooted in its growing acceptance as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Institutional investment, the halving events that reduce the supply of Bitcoin over time, and increasing global economic uncertainties all contribute to its bullish outlook. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to position itself as digital gold, its trajectory towards $110,000 seems not only plausible but inevitable.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Setting the Stage for $6,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) has carved its niche as the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, contributing significantly to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The transition to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), promises improved scalability, security, and sustainability. These enhancements, coupled with the ongoing development within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, provide a solid foundation for ETH to climb to $6,000. As more developers and enterprises adopt its technology, Ethereum's influence and value are expected to soar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption2Trade (O2T): The Dark Horse Racing to $100\n\nOption2Trade (O2T) emerges as the dark horse in the crypto race, with predictions placing its value at an astonishing $100 before Q4 2024. This A.I-driven trading platform distinguishes itself by democratizing access to sophisticated trading strategies and market insights, traditionally reserved for the realm of high-frequency trading firms and hedge funds. By leveraging artificial intelligence, O2T can analyze market data in real-time, predict trends, and execute trades with precision, offering an unprecedented advantage to individual investors. The potential of A.I in transforming the trading landscape, combined with O2T's innovative approach, sets the stage for its meteoric rise to $100.\n\nDriving Factors Behind the Predictions\n\nTechnological Advancements: For all three cryptocurrencies, continuous technological innovation is a key driver of their predicted price increases. BTC's enhancements in scalability, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) transition to Ethereum 2.0, and O2T's application of A.I in trading are pivotal developments.\n\nAdoption and Integration: The growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by institutions and their integration into traditional finance, along with O2T's potential to attract a new demographic of traders, contribute significantly to their bullish forecasts.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Sentiment: The cyclical nature of the crypto market, historical trends, and current investor sentiment play crucial roles in shaping these price predictions. The anticipation of increased demand against a backdrop of limited supply, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) , underpins these optimistic valuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is poised for significant growth, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Option2Trade (O2T) leading the charge. As we look towards Q4 2024, the predictions of BTC reaching $110,000, Ethereum (ETH) climbing to $6,000, and O2T soaring to $100 reflect not just speculative optimism but a belief in the fundamental value and potential of these digital assets. For investors and enthusiasts alike, the coming months present an unparalleled opportunity to be part of a financial revolution that continues to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor more information on the Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T) Presale:\n\n\n\nUse promo code O2TLaunch to get 15% bonus\n\nVisit Option2Trade (O2T) (O2T)\n\n\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\n\n\nhttps://t.me/O2TOfficial\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Option2Trade (O2T)\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Slumped Today - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "It's been a rather choppy day in the cryptocurrency world. The entire crypto market is down 3.9% over the past 24 hours, as of 3 p.m. ET, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) leading the way lower. These three major tokens have declined 4.5%, 5.1%, and 7% over the same time frame, outpacing the losses of the overall market.\n\nIn the crypto world, these are three of the mostly closely watched cryptos, due to their importance to a wide range of investors. As the world's largest and second-largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum are viewed as the benchmarks for the sector. Most of the value being accrued to this space goes to these two tokens, which currently account for well more than half the value of the overall sector. For investors in Dogecoin, plenty can be gleaned from this meme token's price movements with respect to sentiment in this sector, particularly among speculators.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving this price action today.\n\nThis year was supposed to the risk-on rally, was it not?\n\nMuch of today's move with respect to Bitcoin and Ethereum, seen as stores of value, appears to be tied to concerns around rate cut bets, and the effect on the U.S. dollar (which has remained very strong over the past month). As the dollar strengthens amid bets that interest rate cuts may be fewer (or farther away) than anticipated, that's going to have some impact on the valuations of these top cryptocurrencies that are benchmarked against the dollar, similar to other commodities.\n\nAdditionally, some concerns around cooling spot Bitcoin ETF demand has sent Bitcoin (and the entire market) lower today. The latest data as of April 1 shows net daily outflows from these exchange-traded products of around $1.1 billion, hurting the overall thesis that strong demand and an upcoming halving event for Bitcoin could lead to price outperformance. This could also hurt demand for Ethereum ahead of potential spot ETFs launched for this token, as well as overall institutional capital flows into this digital asset.\n\nDogecoin's decline today really needs to be put into perspective, since this token hit a fresh two-year high this week. There's still plenty of hype around the world's largest meme token relating to an upcoming meme token spinoff and an upcoming launch of futures contracts on Coinbase. But as is the case with most daily moves, Dogecoin's outsize plunge relates to its nature as a more speculative asset traders use to bet on broader price moves.\n\nIs the party over?\n\nThis crypto rally has been relatively orderly, so investors may want to consider today's decline in these three top tokens from a broader lens. Yes, a 5% to 7% daily decline in any asset is a big move. But in the larger scheme of things, these higher-risk volatile assets tend to move in such fashion on a frequent basis. Accordingly, I'm not entirely sure much can be made about today's decline signaling an end to the strong rally we've seen this year. At least, not yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, investors will certainly want to pay attention to incoming macro data and spot ETF inflows as a gauge of how demand for digital assets continues to evolve. I'm not surprised to see a downtick in ETF inflows in recent days, given the run-up we've seen thus far this year. However, it will be important to see if investors return to this asset class, or if a broader rotation is underway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs the second quarter of 2024 begins, Ethereum (ETH) investors are looking to history for clues about the potential performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Ethereum's price history reveals a pattern of robust Q2 gains, with an average increase of 67.19%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto analyst Ali shared a screenshot of Ethereum's quarterly returns; ETH saw massive gains of 453% and 102.25% in Q2 of 2017 and 2019, respectively. Gains for the second quarter averaged 67.19%, with a median of 15.29%.\n\nQ2 has historically been very bullish for $ETH!\n\n\n\nHowever, we must consider the high probability that the @SECGov will delay the approval of a spot #Ethereum ETF, which may cause turbulence in the market. pic.twitter.com/TlZ3KZhr4e \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2024\n\nThis positive trend has been consistent enough to catch the eye of investors who see Q2 as a period of opportunity for Ethereum, with many anticipating another season of strong returns.\n\nHowever, the potential denial of a spot Ethereum ETF, which might cause significant price volatility, casts a shadow over this optimistic outlook.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated investment platform for institutional and individual investors, thereby increasing demand and driving up ETH prices. Several issuers, including VanEck and Fidelity, have sought approval to launch them.\n\nHowever, approval for such an ETF is far from guaranteed. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts believe there is only a 25% likelihood of approval.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission previously postponed a decision on a spot exchange-traded fund, but it must make one by May 23, which is one of the applicants' final deadlines.\n\nOn May 23, the SEC will decide whether to approve or refuse VanEck's application. If they decline the request, issuers who still want to be approved will have to refile applications, or they can challenge the regulator's decision through litigation.\n\nSeven issuers are proposing to launch a spot Ethereum ETF fund: BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares with Ark and Hashdex.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 1.59% in the last 24 hours, at $3,558. Ethereum temporarily rose above $3,600 over the weekend after falling as much as 25% between March 11 and 19. According to Santiment, the number of ETH addresses holding coins has reached highs of 118,230, with midterm MVRV suggesting a mild bullish signal."

        "title": "Could This New Trillion-Dollar Market Opportunity Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Keep an eye on Wall Street's new asset tokenization trend. If it takes off, it could unlock enormous value for Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock (BLK 0.02%), the company that led the push for the first spot ETF for Bitcoin, is back at it again, this time with an entirely new investment product for the Ethereum (ETH -2.20%) blockchain. If all goes according to plan, this new product could revolutionize the way Wall Street does business.\n\nThat's a lot to ask, of course, but I think Ethereum could be ready to take full advantage of this potential new trillion-dollar market opportunity. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at what this new product is, why it launched on Ethereum, and how it could transform the world of finance.\n\nWhat is a tokenized asset fund?\n\nThe new product, called the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is a tokenized asset fund, and it's part of a long-term trend on Wall Street called asset tokenization. While the term \"asset tokenization\" might sound a bit intimidating, it simply refers to the process of transforming a real-world financial asset into a blockchain-based digital asset.\n\nIn this case, BlackRock is \"tokenizing\" nearly $100 million worth of cash, T-bills, and repos. When institutional investors buy into the fund, they receive a crypto token on the Ethereum blockchain that has several unique properties. For example, it behaves much like a stablecoin, except that it also has the potential to pay out a daily yield. Stablecoins, which are usually pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, aren't supposed to be able to do that! The reason BlackRock's crypto token can do this is the result of the efficiencies made possible by blockchain technology.\n\nThat's why this product -- even though it might be a bit difficult to fully wrap one's head around it -- could be so revolutionary. In theory, blockchain-based digital assets should be superior to traditional, real-world assets. And thus, by extension, they should be more attractive to investors. According to BlackRock, the new tokenized asset fund boasts several key advantages for institutional investors when it comes to transparency, liquidity, and settlement time.\n\nLooking long term, a number of very smart people think asset tokenization could be a huge, multitrillion-dollar trend. Citigroup, for example, recently called asset tokenization a $4 trillion market opportunity. And the Boston Consulting Group has been even more bullish, calling it a potential $16 trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nWhy Ethereum?\n\nSo you can see where I'm going with this, right? Any blockchain that is leading this new multitrillion-dollar trend could see a huge spike in valuation, once investors realize what's happening and how significant it could be.\n\nThat's why it's so significant that BlackRock chose Ethereum for its first-ever tokenized asset fund. The Wall Street giant could have picked any other blockchain, but it picked Ethereum. And that's clearly due to the fact that Ethereum is the 800-pound gorilla of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. According to the total value locked metric (TVL), which measures how much DeFi activity is taking place on a particular blockchain, Ethereum currently accounts for a whopping 57% of all DeFi activity in the blockchain world.\n\nOf course, it's fair to push back and say: Hey, this is just one product. So what? Well, the bigger context is that BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with nearly $10 trillion in assets under management. Moreover, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is on record as saying that asset tokenization is an absolute megatrend for Wall Street. As soon as the new Bitcoin ETFs launched, he told CNBC that asset tokenization was coming next. So there's clearly more to come.\n\nPotential impact on valuation\n\nIf you agree that asset tokenization is the future of finance, and if you think that Ethereum will remain the DeFi leader, then it makes sense that Ethereum could soar in value as this trend gains legs. But by just how much?\n\nOne approach might be to track the TVL metric for Ethereum over time, to see if it is moving upward as expected. As more tokenized asset funds launch, and as Ethereum gets more and more involved with the asset tokenization trend, it should start showing up in the numbers. Currently, Ethereum has a TVL of $52 billion and a market cap of $425 billion. Roughly speaking, every $1 billion gain in TVL is worth an additional $8 billion in market cap.\n\nOf course, it's not a slam dunk that Ethereum will be able to get in front of this trend. After all, blockchains are by their very nature decentralized. There's no CEO at company headquarters running the numbers, demanding Ethereum leap headfirst into this market opportunity.\n\nInstead, it's much more the case of thousands of Ethereum developers around the world steadily making new improvements to the Ethereum blockchain, which in turn, make the blockchain more attractive to companies like BlackRock when they launch new products. So, while you should definitely keep your expectations for Ethereum in check, this could very much be a trend worth monitoring."

Last year, CEO Larry Fink said at a conference in New York that he believes \u00abthe tokenization of securities will define the next generation of markets\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThe distributed ledgers [on blockchain technology] will enable real-time settlement of transactions and change the entire ecosystem,\u00bb Fink added.\n\nBlackrock's Second Crypto Fund\n\nIn early January 2024, Blackrock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust, an investment fund for Bitcoin, and aimed at investors who do not want to or cannot buy the cryptocurrency directly themselves. The fund already has a net worth of $17.9 billion.

        "title": "Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price falls for a second consecutive day as bears ignite $91.91 million of liquidated positions.\n\nPast gains during the year\u2019s second quarter can be a positive amid uncertainty in SEC's Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nFounder Vitalik Buterin explains key steps for \"The Purge\" on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nRead more: Ethereum consolidates above $3,500 as Bitwise CIO says ETF delay would be positive\n\nDaily digest market movers: liquidations, historical Q2 gains, and The Purge\n\nEthereum's chances of seeing a significant price boost face uncertainty as the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is yet to show any positive sign of approving applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. As a result, much of its price movements in the past months have largely been due to its high correlation with Bitcoin rather than its own fundamentals.\n\nFor example, in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin shed almost 6% of its value, triggering similar losses in Ethereum, which has seen more than a 6.7% decline. Losses in the two largest cryptocurrencies saw over $500.6 million liquidated from the entire crypto market in the past 24 hours, with the largest single liquidation order valued at $7.48 million. The total ETH liquidations sit at $91.91 million, with long positions accounting for $75.1 million.\n\nHowever, historical records show Ethereum may still have a positive second quarter despite the downbeat start. A chart by crypto analyst @ali_charts on X shows Ethereum's Q2 results have always been positive except in 2022, when it recorded a 67.34% loss. According to the charts, ETH's Q2 historical performance has an average of 66.59% and a median of 15.29% in gains.\n\nEthereum returns in Q2 chart\n\nAlthough, he also noted that the \"high probability\" of the SEC delaying approval for a spot Ethereum ETF can cause \"turbulence in the market.\" On the contrary, a green light from the SEC would give Ethereum more institutional backing and exposure to a large number of retail traders, which may cause a rally in its price.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also provided insights that indicate long-term progress for the cryptocurrency and its underlying ecosystem. On Monday, he highlighted in a blog post that a lesser-known Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP), the EIP-6780, was introduced during the recent Ethereum Dencun upgrade. He mentioned that EIP-6780 is a huge part of what he terms \"The Purge.\"\n\nThe Purge would help \"slim down Ethereum and clear technical debt,\" said Buterin. In essence, it would shift workload from the main chain, reducing the computational and technical resources of running an Ethereum node while boosting decentralization and security in the process, Buterin said.\n\nIn other news, Vitalik Buterin reposted on Tuesday a former blog post he wrote squashing Layer 3s that serve the same purpose as L2s. He mentioned that L3s only make sense if they serve a different scaling purpose from an L2.\n\nAlso read: Vitalik Buterin announces next step in simplifying Ethereum protocol, ushers in the Purge\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH could fall below $3,000\n\nIn an analysis on Monday, @ali_charts said in an X post that Ethereum could crash to $2,800 if it breached the $3,400 support level. As of the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,362.1. However, another X user noted a strong historical bidding at the $3,200-$3,000 area.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nThis aligns with earlier predictions by FXStreet analyst Akash Girimath, who stated that Ethereum's price could sweep the range low at $3,054 if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity run."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's Net Worth: A Look Into His Crypto Holdings - Nansen",
        "content": "Vitalik is one of the most respected and influential people in crypto. As one of the cofounders of Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in the world today, many are curious about his net worth and how much Ethereum (ETH) he has. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into his crypto portfolio and holdings over time, and uncover an estimate of his net worth.\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nBorn in Russia in 1994 and later relocating to Canada, Vitalik Buterin emerged as a prodigy with a keen interest in computer science and mathematics. By 2014, he had co-founded Ethereum, introducing the groundbreaking concept of \"smart contracts\" through a decentralized protocol. His vision for Ethereum extended beyond merely creating a digital currency. He aimed to enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on a platform that is not only censorship-resistant but also secure, scalable, and sustainable. His goal was to democratize access to these services, fostering greater equality worldwide.\n\nVitalik Buterin's Net Worth\n\nAt the time of writing, Vitalik's net worth, primarily derived from his cryptocurrency holdings, exceeds $1.025 billion, with the bulk of his wealth, approximately $1 billion, attributed to his ETH holdings.\n\nDetermining his exact net worth is challenging, as his non-crypto assets (such as cash, real estate, and private equity investments) and any undisclosed crypto holdings are not publicly documented. However, it's reasonable to infer that a significant portion of his wealth is in cryptocurrencies.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Crypto Holdings\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the prominent co-founder of Ethereum has most of his crypto holdings in ETH and on the Ethereum network. $1.024B of his holdings across the blockchains that we have support for are on the Ethereum network.\n\nVitalik Buterin currently holds 278,524 ETH (~$1M) and 256 WETH ($919K), which makes him one of the largest holders of ETH. He currently holds 0.23% of all ETH in existence.\n\nBesides ETH, his two largest holdings are $21.7M in USDC and $782K in KNCL. KNCL is the legacy token of Kyber Network to which he is an advisor.\n\nVitalik\u2019s Crypto Activity\n\nHe is the largest donor to the CryptoRelief India Fund. The fund was set up during the peak of the Covid crisis to help provide healthcare and essentials to the country. Vitalik sent 50.69T SHIB ($931M), 600 ETH ($2.1M) and 100 MKR ($406K) to the fund.\n\nAnalyzing his portfolio over the past year, Vitalik had an initial position of 500 MKR tokens, worth $336K at that time, which he swapped to ETH and DAI when the position grew to over $570K in September 2023.\n\nOccasionally, Vitalik transfers a small portion of his funds over to exchanges such as Coinbase, along side further philanthropic activity.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith over $1B in onchain assets, Vitalik is among the largest whales in crypto and one of the top individual ETH holders. However, accumulating wealth isn't his primary goal; he is known for his generous contributions to philanthropic efforts. While a complete overview of all his assets is beyond our reach, we possess a deep understanding of his onchain activity."

        "content": "Polygon CEO Marc Boiron thinks that L3s take away value from Ethereum.\n\nShare this article\n\nRecent comments made by Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron have ignited a debate on the necessity and potential consequences of Layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing that they may divert value and security away from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe growth of adoption and development for L3 networks like Orbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains, and Degen Chain, have attracted significant activity across a number platforms, prompting key figures in the crypto space such as Boiron to voice their opinion on the matter of Layer 3 networks.\n\n\u201cL3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,\u201d Boiron said.\n\nBoiron argues further argued that if all L3s settled to one L2, Ethereum would capture little value, putting its security at risk.\n\nThe L3 debate has been brewing for some time now. In 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin began the argument that the purpose of L3s were to provide a \u201ccustomizable functionality\u201d towards L2s, although not necessarily operating as extensible layers of the core functionality designed for L2s. To Buterin, a third layer on the blockchain ecosystem would only be practical if its function fundamentally differs to what L2s already serve.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Boiron\u2019s assessment. Some respondents argued that L2 value is inherently tied to Ethereum\u2019s value, while others pointed out the potential benefits of L3s, such as lower bridging costs and specialized functionality.\n\nPeter Haymond, senior partnership manager at Offchain Labs, countered Boiron\u2019s claims. According to Haymond, advantages such as low-cost native bridging from L2, custom gas tokens, and specialized state transition are functions that don\u2019t necessarily \u201ctake value\u201d away from Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum Foundation researcher Patrick McCorry expressed surprise at Boiron\u2019s take, suggesting that L3s could allow L2s to become settlement layers and ultimately rely on Ethereum as a \u201cglobal ordering service [and] final judge of settlement.\n\nDegen Chain, a recently launched L3 running on top of the Base L2 network, is one of the L3 networks that have gained a significant traction (and volume), with one anonymous trader reportedly making as much as a $2 million profit over a $7,000 investment.\n\nDegen Chain, notably, was built using Arbitrum Orbit, a new offering from the Arbitrum ecosystem that enables developers to create \u201cmodular\u201d or customizable Layer 2 and Layer 3 chains. In this context, Orbit chains operate by connecting to the core ecosystem of Arbitrum, with the ability to settle transactions over Ethereum L2 solutions."

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is issuing a warning on Ethereum, saying that ETH could still witness a 2019-style collapse.\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 796,000 YouTube subscribers that the conditions for Ethereum now are similar to that of mid-2019, and that the leading smart contract platform may suffer a similar setback.\n\nCowen notes that in 2019, a slash in interest rates coincided with a dramatic correction for ETH. With the Fed expected to begin cutting rates again at some point this year, the analyst suggests that a similar scenario could play out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how [Ethereum] plays out here, if it does just continue to mimic sort of a bigger version of [its pattern in 2019] or if it does something completely different\u2026\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t like the fact that I compare it to 2019 because it\u2019s gone up, because it\u2019s been taking a lot longer, but still, because ETH/BTC continues to drop, and because the Fed has not yet pivoted, why would we assume that it\u2019s not following the same thing?\n\nNothing has changed, right? It\u2019s still bleeding against Bitcoin, the Fed has not yet cut rates, and that was the turning point for it at the midcycle top last cycle.\u201d\n\nCowen says that if Ethereum repeats its 2019 correction, then a multi-month consolidation may be in store before the Fed begins a quantitative easing (QE) and crypto markets bounce again near the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cIf you have a hard time with that \u2013 sort of a six to nine-month lull in the market \u2013 what\u2019s fascinating is that if everything\u2019s been shifted by about three quarters, what if you shift this again?\n\nYou go three quarters out, you get to the end of the year and then QE (quantitative easing) returns and you get another bull market \u2013 I mean maybe, maybe that\u2019s how it plays out.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $3,530 at time of writing, a 2.28% decrease on the day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bonk Plunged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Speculative assets are dropping to start the week.\n\nVolatility continues to be the name of the game in cryptocurrencies and today is no different. But unlike most of 2024, the market is working against investors today.\n\nAs of 1:45 p.m. ET, the value of Bitcoin (BTC -2.06%) has dropped 2.8%, Ethereum (ETH -2.20%) is down 5.2%, and Bonk (BONK -4.52%) has fallen 9.4%. The move was impacted by a long holiday weekend in parts of the world, but 24/7 trading in crypto kept market speculation moving.\n\nInflation strikes again\n\nThe biggest data point impacting the market today is the ISM factory index, which improved by 2.5% in March to 50.3%. A reading over 50% indicates that manufacturing managers think the manufacturing market is expanding. This followed 16 straight months of expected declines.\n\nInvestors take this reading as a sign the economy is doing fine, despite higher interest rates over the past few years. If inflation is under control and the Federal Reserve doesn't need to cut rates to help the economy, it may not cut rates at all.\n\nBond traders are now pricing odds at a rate cut in June 2024 at less than 50%, which would have been a shock coming into the year. Investors were expecting as much as six rate cuts and they may get through two quarters with none.\n\nCrypto's decline today\n\nThere's a correlation between technology and high-growth stocks and cryptocurrencies and part of the move higher over the past six months has been an anticipation of lower interest rates. As that thesis falls apart it's not unusual to see cryptocurrencies drop.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were another catalyst and that brought billions of dollars into the industry. But last week they started to see outflows, although those turned into inflows again late in the week.\n\nEthereum has also gotten a boost from speculation that it will get ETFs approved over the next few months. But that's not certain in the current regulatory environment.\n\nIf ETFs aren't a catalyst because more aren't approved, crypto values may slide.\n\nBonk's move is just a mirror of the others with some extra volatility added in. This is a meme coin that's become a popular alternative to Dogecoin, but its main value is speculation rather than being a blockchain currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nWhere does crypto go from here?\n\nI think the major catalysts of 2024 are already behind us. Bitcoin's ETFs have helped increase awareness and investment in crypto and that pulled the entire industry higher. And speculation based on the economic environment and a potential cut in rates seems to have been overdone.\n\nThat leaves fundamentals driving the crypto market and that's not a great place to be. Bitcoin may have value as a \"digital gold,\" but I think it's more of a speculative asset than anything. Ethereum's promise was always that it would provide real-world use cases in finance and digital assets, but it's so slow and so much more expensive that other blockchains are gaining popularity.\n\nBonk's meme pop has been nice, but the meme coins never seem to last. And without a catalyst, I could see all three cryptos falling over the next few months as investors look for more fundamental value on the market."

        "content": "Welcome to Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their roles in this vast, ever-changing ecosystem\u2014and what it all means for how we use money.\n\nCoinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in the U.S., posting $273 million in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023, putting the firm\u2019s net profitability for all of 2023 at $95 million.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has always taken a long-term approach focusing on building in a compliant manner, even when it wasn\u2019t the popular choice,\u201d CEO Brian Armstrong said on a February earnings call. \u201cMany of our competitors cut corners and broke laws to get big fast, and we\u2019ve seen how that strategy played out.\u201d\n\nAlesia Haas joined the company in April 2018. She previously was CFO for Sculptor Capital Management (formerly Och-Ziff Capital Management Group), a global institutional alternative asset manager. She also served as CFO and head of strategy for OneWest Bank.\n\nIn a conversation with Fortune, Haas shared insights on Bitcoin\u2019s record high, the latest crypto bull market, the SEC\u2019s take on Ethereum, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing, and what drew her to the world of crypto from traditional finance.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nEarlier this month, Bitcoin reached a record high above $72,000. Can you share some insight on what this means in a larger sense?\n\nI think it\u2019s important with crypto to zoom out and look at what has happened since the Bitcoin white paper and crypto first came on the scene. You\u2019ve seen four price cycles. What I love about looking at these price cycles is that every peak is higher than its last peak. And every trough is higher than the last trough.\n\nIf you look at this, you have a lot of volatility, but there is this steady up and into-the-right curve. When you look at the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year return of Bitcoin against every other asset, it has been one of the top performing assets over any other comparable.\n\nA lot of this was driven by the Bitcoin ETFs. What I think is important to note is that ETFs unlock new demand for this asset class. Previously, a lot of investment advisors couldn\u2019t access Bitcoin because of their investment mandates. Now they can buy Bitcoin in an ETF wrapper, and so it opens up new available capital.\n\nWhat does Bitcoin\u2019s rise mean for other cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum?\n\nI think that we\u2019re starting to see differentiation between different cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, where Bitcoin is a store-of-value asset, and people are putting it in their portfolio as an important store-of-value in wealth creation.\n\nEthereum has become the protocol that developers are increasingly choosing to build decentralized applications on top of. While Bitcoin is the largest asset, we generally see \u201ca rising tide lifts all ships\u201d effect where crypto then comes up. But you\u2019re starting to see differentiation because people are choosing Ethereum, and it is increasingly going to change depending on developer activity and user activity of that platform. Stablecoins and NFTs are built on Ethereum. There are just a lot of new use cases built on top of that protocol.\n\nSpeaking of Ethereum, what\u2019s the latest with this SEC now attempting to define it as a security?\n\nEthereum is not a security. Historically, the SEC has repeatedly said that Ether isn\u2019t a security. The CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] has said that Ether isn\u2019t a security. The core problem here is that we still do not have comprehensive crypto regulation at the federal level in the United States. And this is something that we feel passionately about. It\u2019s so critical to get regulatory clarity so we can have a clear, equitable, applied regulatory framework that will protect consumers and ensure responsible markets\u2014and also protect businesses like Coinbase, so we know how we can bring compliant products to the market and continue innovation here in America.\n\nWhat can we learn from the latest crypto bull market?\n\nIn general, what we\u2019re seeing is similar to past bull markets, whereas crypto prices rise, you see an increase in volatility, then you see an increase in engagement. As we shared on our Q4 earnings call in February, we saw elevated engagement, net inflows across the board in retail institutional, and we saw higher trading volumes.\n\nWith almost $12 billion of net inflows into ETFs, we\u2019ve seen a market cap of over $2.5 trillion. What this does is it puts crypto back in the headlines. It has become a topic of conversation in households. And we\u2019re seeing really great engagement from customers who sort of went dormant a little bit in 2021, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cOh, this asset class is back.\u201d\n\nThe crypto sector nosedived after FTX imploded and cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested. He was just sentenced to 25 years in prison. Has the industry finally turned a page?\n\nWell, fraud is fraud. And I\u2019m pleased to see the process being followed when you have fraud in the markets. It\u2019s a travesty that occurred. But I think we\u2019ve moved on, and I think the market has largely moved on. Coinbase was always focused on compliance. We are excited to build and regain the trust of our customers. But there has been a flight to quality. We\u2019ve seen that flight to quality now over the past year. And we\u2019re pleased to continue to see people\u2019s focus and growth on good companies here.\n\nBefore joining Coinbase, you worked in asset management, as a CFO, and held senior roles at Merrill Lynch and General Electric. What most attracted you to your current company?\n\nI\u2019m old enough that I grew up in the early internet era and have just watched the transformation of how technology creates new use cases. When I learned about blockchain, I could see that if you tokenize real-world assets\u2014and send value peer to peer\u2014that was going to create a more inclusive, faster, and cheaper financial system. And that was such an exciting thing to be a part of.\n\nI have worked for banks and asset managers, and I saw how many people touch the transaction just to move money from me to you, and how many different steps and different market participants it takes. I saw the cost. I saw the friction. And I said, \u201cIf technology solves this, it will be adopted. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if.\u201d I wanted to be part of that excitement in the journey to build trusted products in this ecosystem.\n\nComing from traditional finance, I knew that if you\u2019re holding customers\u2019 assets, their wealth, their investments, you need to become a trusted brand. I thought I could really contribute value to Coinbase.\n\nHow would you describe the role of digital assets in the future of finance?\n\nWell, first of all, it\u2019s already here: 52 million Americans own crypto. We now have ETFs for anybody with a retirement account to own crypto. You can now send a U.S. dollar in the form of a stablecoin to anyone in the world, anywhere, anytime, cheaply and instantly. It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re already here.\n\nI think what we\u2019ll see is an increasing number of transactions happening on the blockchain. We\u2019ll tokenize more real-world assets. Just last week, BlackRock announced they\u2019re tokenizing a money-market fund. Now we have money-market funds where you can earn high yields but in tokenized form.\n\nThese are new ways that we can bring the global world together in a peer-to-peer way\u2014fewer intermediaries, lower costs\u2014and tokenize real-world assets, which makes those assets more available to more people in more markets. I think that\u2019s really exciting."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has revealed the next significant phase in the evolution of the Ethereum (ETH) network, termed as \"The Purge.\" In a recent communication, Buterin shared insights into the ongoing efforts to simplify the Ethereum protocol while enhancing its security measures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of this evolution is EIP-6780, a lesser-known but pivotal improvement introduced in the Dencun hard fork. This enhancement aims to streamline the protocol by reducing the functionality of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, thereby enhancing implementation efficiency and bolstering security measures.\n\nThis move, as elucidated by Buterin, is part of a broader mission to declutter Ethereum's infrastructure and alleviate technical burdens. The Purge initiative entails eliminating redundancies, reducing resource loads and fortifying security protocols to bolster Ethereum's efficiency and resilience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka \"the Purge\"):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024\n\nAmong the key transformations initiated under The Purge, Ethereum clients have witnessed a substantial reduction in code lines, with the elimination of support for pre-merge (PoW) networks. Additionally, Ethereum's storage mechanism has undergone optimization, significantly reducing storage requirements for node operators.\n\nThe Purge by Vitalik Buterin\n\nHowever, Buterin does not stop there. He outlines potential areas for further refinement, including the revaluation of precompiles and the optimization of historical data storage. These steps are aimed at enhancing the functionality of ETH while simultaneously reducing barriers to entry for node operators and developers.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin hints at the transition to SimpleSerialize (SSZ), a more efficient block structure, heralding a simpler and cleaner future for Ethereum's data management.\n\nThe overarching goal of \"The Purge\" is to streamline Ethereum's architecture, reduce technical complexities, and enhance its scalability and decentralization. By prioritizing protocol simplification and security enhancements, Ethereum aims to solidify its position as a leading blockchain platform capable of supporting diverse decentralized applications and use cases."

        "content": "Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan, has indicated that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may push back the approval of eagerly awaited Ethereum (ETH-USD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to December.\n\nAfter its spot Bitcoin ETF debut, which rapidly amassed over $2 billion and ranked fifth in what\u2019s been dubbed by the cryptocurrency community the \u201cCointucky Derby,\u201d Bitwise now faces another showdown with the SEC. Despite the expected delay, Hougan remains optimistic, proposing that a more gradual introduction to Ethereum ETFs could allow traditional finance more time to acclimate to the crypto ecosystem, potentially setting the stage for a stronger market entry.\n\nSimultaneously, Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, has actively lobbied for the SEC\u2019s approval of spot market Ethereum ETFs, citing Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus as a superior security measure compared to Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work system. Consensys championed Ethereum\u2019s robust security framework in a persuasive letter to the SEC, arguing for the unfounded nature of the SEC\u2019s fraud and manipulation concerns.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s price action over Easter Weekend ended on a positive note. ETH ended lower on Saturday, but only slightly (-0.10%). Its performance on Sunday, however, was a very different story, as Etheruem closed higher by nearly +4% in the $3,650 value area. Sunday\u2019s close resulted in the highest daily close since March 15.\n\nOn a weekly timeframe, the TipRanks summary of indicators shows Ethereum\u2019s current MACD indicator at 393.07, typically signaling a Sell due to the potential downward momentum. However, the broader context of Ethereum\u2019s market performance, particularly its exponential moving averages, tells a more bullish story.\n\nThe 20-period EMA of Ethereum at $3,014.89 is significantly below its current price of $3,610.09. Similarly, the 50-period EMA is $2,502.46, also well below the current price. These indicators typically suggest a bullish trend, as the current price exceeds short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating strong buying pressure and potential for continued upward movement.\n\nOn a monthly time frame, Ethereum ended March higher with a gain of +9.09%, but off of its monthly highs near $4,100.\n\nDon\u2019t let crypto give you a run for your money.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s \u2018Degen Communism\u2019 and his vision for reducing Ethereum technical debt - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin spent April Fools\u2019 Day writing both serious and playful content across the Ethereum website and his personal blog. Across the two posts, he advocated protocol simplifications and efficiency improvements while exploring thought-provoking ideas about the future of political and economic systems in an increasingly digital world.\n\nIn his more serious post, Buterin detailed the latest hard fork, Dencun, which introduced a series of protocol simplifications as part of the section of the Ethereum roadmap called \u201cThe Purge.\u201d This effort aims to streamline Ethereum\u2019s codebase, reduce technical debt, and enhance the platform\u2019s overall performance. Notable changes include the reduction of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode\u2019s functionality, the introduction of a limited storage window for blobs, and the potential removal of rarely used precompiles.\n\nThese simplifications are expected to make Ethereum client development and infrastructure building more straightforward, paving the way for increased decentralization and efficiency. Buterin highlighted other examples of \u201cpurging\u201d efforts, such as the Geth client dropping support for pre-merge Proof-of-Work networks and an EIP eliminating the need to handle \u201cempty accounts.\u201d Additionally, the Dencun hard fork introduced an 18-day storage window for blobs, significantly reducing the storage requirements for Ethereum nodes.\n\nAnother area targeted for simplification is precompiles, which are Ethereum contracts implemented directly by clients. As Buterin noted, precompiles like RIPEMD-160, Identity, BLAKE2, and MODEXP have rarely been used to source consensus bugs and challenges for new EVM implementations. The Ethereum community is considering either removing these precompiles entirely or replacing them with equivalent EVM code.\n\nEIP-4444, which removes the requirement for every Ethereum node to store all historical blocks indefinitely, is set to significantly increase the network\u2019s node decentralization. Under this proposal, entities like block explorers will store entire history, while peer-to-peer protocols can be utilized to store and distribute historical data more efficiently.\n\nButerin also discussed a proposed LOG reform to remove bloom filters and simplify the LOG opcode. This change would pave the way for separate protocols using zero-knowledge proofs and incrementally verifiable computation to generate provably correct \u201clog trees\u201d for applications requiring decentralized access to logs.\n\nThe Ethereum execution layer is also slated to transition from RLP and Merkle Patricia tree formats to the more efficient SimpleSerialize (SSZ) format already employed by the consensus layer. This shift will streamline Ethereum\u2019s cryptographic data structures, potentially leading to a single SNARK-friendly hash binary Merkle tree in the long term.\n\nApril Fools\u2019 Day food for thought from Vitalik\n\nWhile these technical improvements are crucial for Ethereum\u2019s long-term success, Buterin has also been exploring more unconventional ideas about the future of society in the digital age. In a thought-provoking April 1 post titled \u201cDegen communism: the only correct political ideology,\u201d Buterin proposed a new ideology that embraces the chaos and risk-taking of the internet while aligning incentives with the common good.\n\nWhile the post is undoubtedly an April Fools\u2019 joke on the surface, it raises some interesting questions about the future of political and economic systems in an increasingly digital and decentralized world.\n\nCentral to this concept is the idea of \u201cchaos with a purpose,\u201d which suggests that instead of suppressing the volatility and unpredictability of markets and social media, we should harness these forces to drive innovation and progress. Buterin proposes various mechanisms to redirect the benefits of this chaos towards public goods and protect vulnerable individuals from its downsides.\n\nAlthough \u201cdegen communism\u201d is far from a fully-fledged political ideology and is not intended to be taken entirely seriously, it highlights the need for innovative thinking in addressing the complex social and economic issues of the 21st century. By embracing change and experimentation while prioritizing equity and social welfare, we may be better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the digital age.\n\nAs Ethereum evolves, Buterin\u2019s vision for the platform and the broader digital landscape demonstrates a commitment to both technical excellence and social responsibility. The ongoing efforts to simplify and improve Ethereum\u2019s protocol, combined with thought-provoking ideas about society\u2019s future, showcase blockchain technology\u2019s potential to drive positive change on multiple fronts.\n\nWhile some of the ideas proposed in Buterin\u2019s April Fools\u2019 post, such as Harberger taxes on intellectual property and \u201cproof of stake\u201d schemes for immigration, may seem radical or impractical, they serve as a reminder that addressing the challenges of this century will require bold, innovative thinking. As the Ethereum community works to build a more efficient, secure, and decentralized platform, it is essential to consider the broader implications of these technological advancements and their potential to shape the future of society.\n\nMentioned in this article"

So if you think $10 is impossible for XRP but $10,000 ETH is realistic for ETH, you need to check your bias real quick.\u201d\n\nXRP is trading at $0.614 at time of writing.\n\nIn terms of shorter-term predictions, the analyst thinks Bitcoin will continue to trade sideways for a few more days.\n\n\u201cBids now capping price on the downside (or attempting to) the same way asks were capping upside earlier.

        "content": "Crypto asset manager Bitwise is advocating for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to delay approving a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBitwise, which launched its own spot Bitcoin ETF in January, believes the traditional finance world is still getting up to speed on Bitcoin and may not be ready to properly evaluate an Ether product just yet.\n\nChief Investment Officer at Bitwise, in an interview with Forbes, Matt Hougan said:\n\n\u201cI feel very confident we\u2019ll get an ether ETF. It\u2019s hard to get financial advisors to think about Ethereum right now. We just went through the Dencun upgrade, which in my mind opens the world to a Cambrian explosion of incredible applications and is a massive deal, and it hasn\u2019t come up once in conversations over the past week, and I\u2019ve been on the road all week.\n\nChallenges In Evaluating Ethereum\n\nBitwise believes traditional finance is still wrapping its head around Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Ethereum\u2019s more advanced use cases as a decentralized computing platform may prove too much for advisors to digest simultaneously.\n\nHougan stated that while advisors are beginning to understand Bitcoin is not just used for purchases, the idea of Ethereum being a complete blockchain for building apps with a unique burn mechanism is still a larger conceptual leap.\n\nThe crypto veteran believes an Ether ETF approved in December or later would likely see much stronger demand than a product rushed to market in May when several issuers have indicated they may launch competing offerings.\n\nDespite his hesitation on the timing, Hougan made clear that Bitwise plans to be a \u201cbig player\u201d in the Ether ETF arena once it feels the market is ready, stating \u201cWe intend to get there and file. We just haven\u2019t gotten to it yet.\u201d\n\nWhile contrarian, Bitwise\u2019s stance highlights the complexity in educating the financial establishment on novel crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. With spot Bitcoin ETF over $2 billion raised since its January debut, Hougan argues successful marketing of an ETH fund will require giving advisors more runway to understand Ethereum\u2019s unique value proposition first."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market entered April on a bearish note with leading digital asset Bitcoin showcasing a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. The supply pressure spread across the market tumbled the top altcoins like Ethereum which recorded a 5.7% drop. This downturn breaks the support of week-long consolidation, indicating coin holders may witness a prolonged correction.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Price Prediction: BTC Sheds 2%, ADA & DOGE Drop 5% Amid Pre-Halving Uncertainty\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Faces Key Support Challenge Amid Emerging Bearish Pattern\n\nAmid the recent market consolidation, the Ethereum price wavered in a narrow range between the horizontal level of $3675 and $3445. The price rejection from both sides indicated a clear dominance from bulls and bears toward the asset.\n\nHowever, a deeper analysis of the 4-hour time frame chart showcased the price developing a bearish reversal pattern called double top. The chart setup is commonly spotted at the market top, bolstering a notable correction in the near future.\n\nThus, with an intraday loss of 5.77%, the ETH price gave a bearish breakdown from the neckline support of $3444. Sustaining this breakdown will intensify supply pressure and plunge the altcoin to $3250 or $3057, coinciding with the 38.2% and 50% retracement levels respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Skywards Proposes To Add Ethena\u2019s sUSDe To Aave V3 On Ethereum\n\nEthereum Eyes $4500 Target in April Amid Historical Bullish Trends\n\nLooking at the historical data, Ethereum has shown predominantly positive behavior in April, with high returns in five out of the eight years listed. Notable surges in 2017 (+67.77%), 2018 (+70.29%), and 2020 (+55.04%) highlight this pattern, contributing to an impressive average April return of +23.66%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that there are exceptions, like in 2016 and 2022, when there were significant declines.\n\nAnyhow, if we consider the average return for Ethereum in April, the buyers may drive the asset to a high of $4500 by the end of the month.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nBB Indicator: The converging bands of the Bollinger band indicator reflect increasing volatility in this asset.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: A bearish crossover state between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) lines reflects an active correction trend in play.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs may overwhelm Ethereum ETFs if they are approved in May, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says.\n\nEthereum ETF delay may not imply rejection from the SEC.\n\nEthereum may see a decline if Bitcoin fails to recover\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) prices loses some ground on Monday, paring back some of the gains seen during the weekend, as traders continue to speculate over the possibility of an approval of the spot Ether ETF in May.\n\nBitwise Asset Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said in a Forbes interview published on Sunday that a delay to December would make the launch more successful. This comes at a time when other key market players have provided different views that lean towards the idea that the SEC will likely delay the approval of the seven spot Ethereum ETF filings.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Latest Ethereum ETF applicant wants 12-month delay\n\nMatt Hougan disclosed to Forbes that the recent demand for Ethereum ETFs is a \"natural pathway that crypto investors have followed for 15 years.\" He mentioned how investors usually follow a pattern of wanting exposure to Bitcoin and, eventually, other crypto assets. This follows the significant growth of Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11, as they have attracted more than $10 billion in less than three months, making them the fastest-growing ETFs in history.\n\nWhile Hougan believes an Ethereum ETF will also attract investors, he suggested a 12-month delay will make it more successful. \"I think the Ethereum ETFs will be more successful if they launch in 12 months than (...) in May,\" said Hougan.\n\nHe further stated that traditional finance investors are still trying to master Bitcoin and the crypto market. \"I know that sounds goofy, but I think TradFi is still digesting Bitcoin and if you give TradFi time to get comfortable with Bitcoin and crypto, they will be ready for the next thing,\" Hougan emphasized.\n\nBitwise filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF on March 28, joining other giant institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC has refused to engage with these applicants and delayed any spot Ethereum filings. VanEck's filing is due for a decision on May 23 as a final deadline.\n\nAs a result, many analysts, including Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have lowered their odds of spot ETH approval. Still, the chief legal officers of Coinbase and Grayscale are optimistic of a May approval, citing Ethereum's commodity status.\n\nAmid the delay, the SEC has also issued subpoenas to three firms that transacted with the Ethereum Foundation, according to a Fortune report, in a bid to classify Ethereum as a security. While many have expressed concerns that such classification would hurt the chances of an Ethereum ETF, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in an interview with Fox Business that a spot ETH ETF can still be possible even if the underlying asset is designated a security.\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH may crash if Bitcoin fails to recover\n\nETH\u2019s price recently tagged the $3,574 mid-point of the $3,054 to $4,095 range it set up during its 25% descent between March 11 and 20. While the move may be attractive to trade, \u201ca breakout above $3,574 and $3,658 is likely to be short-lived,\u201d said FXStreet Analyst Akash Girimath.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s short-term range forecasts $4,000 but with a warning for eager ETH bulls\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAkash further emphasized that if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity collection, ETH may crash to the $3,000 psychological level."

Discover SCENE\n\nBase, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, hit a daily record of $1.22 billion worth of trading volume at decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Saturday. The frenzied surge in trading is due to a gold rush for meme coins that has Base-native coins like DEGEN and BRETT hitting over half a billion dollars each in market cap.\n\nThe network set a record for unique daily wallets interacting with a DEX on Saturday with 172,000, according to public blockchain data curated by Dune, and nearly matched that total again on Sunday.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) volume on Base has dropped into the new week\u2014but is still holding significantly higher than previous months, with about $965 million in volume on Sunday, and already $847 million worth so far on Monday as of this writing. As of this writing, Saturday's record is the only day that Base DEX volume has topped the billion-dollar mark.\n\nThe vast majority of that volume is coming from Uniswap, the cross-chain decentralized exchange, which sucked up $1.14 billion worth of the Saturday total. Uniswap has held a roughly 90% daily share of Base DEX volume over the past several days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBroadly, the Base network has seen a \"parabolic\" surge in overall transactions, tweeted Alex Svanevik, founder and CEO of crypto analytics platform Nansen. The platform's data points to an all-time daily peak of nearly 2.39 million transactions on Friday, the most recent day shown on its Base dashboard.\n\nWith the increase in volume and a significant surge in daily active users, Base might end up being the go-to destination for meme coins for this cycle\u2014at least in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOther meme coins have even started migrating to Base, with HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu launching a Base version of their token last week. The price briefly spiked to over $10 before coming back down to parity with its Ethereum mainnet counterpart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nme 3 days ago - base season? can you guys just shut up, you just missed sol me today - were buying memecoins on a base L3 memechain strap in boys \u2014 moon (@MoonOverlord) March 31, 2024\n\nMany traders are calling for \u201cBase season\u201d in an effort to match the momentum of layer-1 network Solana. For the past few months, Solana has been the go-to destination for meme coins, with tokens like Dogwifhat (WIF) hitting over a billion dollars in market cap, and many others with hundreds of millions in market cap as well.\n\nWill the crypto gods give degens a chance to run it all back on Base?

The list of angel investors includes Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, co-founders of Solana, Luca Netz, owner and CEO of Pudgy Penguins, and Gabby Dizon, co-founder of Yield Guild Games.\n\nThis latest round of funding follows Parallel's previous raise of $50 million from Paradigm in 2021, which valued the studio at $500 million. While the updated valuation and the format of the recent funding round were not disclosed, Parallel Studios did share some insights into how they plan to utilize the $35 million infusion.\n\nThe studio intends to expand its user base by onboarding more players through the Parallel Ambassadors program and engaging influencers. Additionally, Parallel Studios has exciting plans for the future. They aim to launch Parallel on the Epic Games Store and Steam, as well as introduce the Planetfall expansion within the game. Mobile versions of Parallel are also in consideration, although specific timelines have yet to be determined.\n\nIn addition to Parallel, the studio has been actively developing Colony, an AI-powered \"survival simulation\" game built on the Solana blockchain. Colony differentiates itself from Parallel by utilizing generative AI technology. Funding from this round will contribute to the development of Wayfinder, an on-chain AI protocol that powers Colony and potentially other applications and games."

Despite this recent decline, ETH remains up by 83% year-to-date and is still the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAlso read: Can Dogwifhat (WIF) Hit $10 After Bitcoin Halving?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction for the week\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for the week. According to their analysis, ETH is expected to reach a minimum price of $3,459 and a maximum price of $3,533. The average price is expected to be $3,500.\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has been largely attributed to the growing expectations of ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. However, the current market sentiment, coupled with Bitcoin\u2019s struggle to push further highs, has dampened the likelihood of ETH surpassing the $4,000 mark this week. Despite the struggle, ETH is likely to surpass the $3,500 level.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: Top 3 Coins To Buy In April For Higher Returns\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Correction Under $3,000 Possible As Bulls Lose Crucial Support - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has encountered notable selling pressure following a rebound last week that propelled its value above $3,600. However, over the past two days, the Ethereum (ETH) price has succumbed to bearish sentiment, with its price slipping below the $3,400 mark once again.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Tank Under $3,000?\n\nIn an analysis provided by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, concerns arise as Ethereum falls below the critical support level of $3,460. This development presents a challenge for bullish sentiment in the market, potentially paving the way for further downward movement in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith the absence of robust support at this level, the likelihood of a continued correction in Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory toward $2,850 or even lower becomes more pronounced.\n\nIn recent market developments, QCP Capital has reported notable activity within the last 24 hours, particularly in the options trading arena for Ethereum (ETH). An increased interest has been observed in selling calls and acquiring puts for both cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis surge in options trading activity has resulted in downward pressure on spot ETH price and has also contributed to maintaining high levels of implied volatilities. Specifically noteworthy is the heightened demand for puts compared to calls in the front-end of Ethereum options, leading to a significant downside risk reversal skew of -5% in April.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nOn the upside, the immediate resistance for Ethereum lies around the $3,400 mark, which coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement from the $3,654 high to the $3,324 low.\n\nA significant resistance level awaits at around $3,420, aligning with both the trend line and the subsequent hurdle at $3,450. Surpassing this level could lead to a test of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the aforementioned downward move.\n\nFurther resistance is anticipated near $3,520, along with the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average (SMA). A successful breach above this level might pave the way for bullish momentum, with potential targets at the $3,650 barrier.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s on-chain indicators have been showing strength. The non-zero Ethereum addresses have surged to a new all-time high in recent weeks.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has taken to the X social media platform to revisit his post about layer-3 scaling solutions amid intensifying debates within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin has noted that these solutions \"don't magically improve throughput,\" but they can still be used for cost saving. That said, there are more efficient ways of cutting costs compared to layer-3s, according to Buterin.\n\nIn his article, which was published a year and a half ago, Buterin singled out three main visions for layer-3s: customized functionality for different use cases, customized scaling in various forms, and weakly-trusted scaling in the form of validiums, which are significantly cheaper compared to rollup but offer better security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, Buterin acknowledged that all of these three visions were \"reasonable.\" He was skeptical of a three-layer scaling architecture with the same scaling scheme, but the Ethereum co-founder also added that a third layer could work if it has a different purpose. \"Validiums on top of rollups do make sense, even if they're not certain to be the long-term best way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nThe debate surrounding layer-3s\n\nButerin's recent comment came after some prominent community members started debating the viability of layer-3 solutions.\n\nMert Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO at Helius, recently opined that L3s were basically \"centralized servers settling on other centralized servers.\" \"The audacity some of you have to call Solana centralized for YEARS just to use literal web servers settling on other centralized web servers is absolutely wild,\" he added.\n\nUniswap CEO Hayden Adams was quick to criticize him, arguing that the Solana community should refrain from posting \"arrogant takes on scaling.\""

Moreover, Balchunas has stated that he could go \"even lower\" than that if he could. \"Again, personally I want them to approve but I also want to get the call right so we will be a perfect 4 for 4 in crypto ETF predictions,\" he added.\n\nLast month, Ethereum ETF approval odds plummeted after the SEC delayed its decision on a slew of existing proposals. Legal analyst Jake Chervinsky speculated that political pressure could be one of the key reasons behind the SEC's hesitancy.\n\nMoreover, according to various reports, the SEC intends to classify the second-largest cryptocurrency as a security, which could further complicate the approval process.\n\nThat said, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently clarified that a spot Ethereum ETF could be approved even if the top altcoin ends up being a security. The financial behemoth filed for a spot-based Ethereum ETF last November.\n\nIn January, the SEC greenlit various spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other prominent names."

Analysts at the crypto trading firm QCP Broadcast said on Tuesday that the liquidations in the derivatives market signaled the recent Bitcoin (BTC) price decline below $66,000 and Ethereum (ETH) price drop to $3,320.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana-based meme coins yielded gains in the past day despite the market-wide correction.\n\nOptions market predicts correction in BTC, ETH prices\n\nBitcoin price declined to as low as $66,000 early on Tuesday on Binance, one of the largest centralized exchanges. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly dropped to $3,319, and cryptocurrencies suffered $157 million in liquidations.\n\nAnalysts at QCP Broadcast said in a Telegram post that the speed of Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s price decline on Tuesday was due to large-volume liquidations on retail-heavy exchanges. Further, the perpetual funding rate on platforms like Binance dropped from as high as 77% to flat, stressing asset prices in the spot market.\n\nBTC/USD 15-minute price chart\n\nQCP Broadcast analysts expect Bitcoin and Ethereum prices to trade sideways after the correction.\n\nMeme coins gain from whiplash in Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe correction in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices was followed by likely capital rotation into meme coins as Solana-based assets noted double-digit gains on Tuesday. Data from CoinGecko shows Tombili the Fat Cat (FATCAT), catwifbag (BAG), BaoBaoSol (BAOS), Cat in a dogs world (MEW) and Book of Meme (BOME) prices rallied between 10% and 52% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana-based meme coins\n\nIn the ongoing market cycle, meme coins have yielded consistent gains for traders during corrections in large assets.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent report by CoinShares, the digital asset investment landscape has shown signs of recovery, with total inflows reaching $862 million last week. This nearly offsets the previous week's record outflows of $931 million. Despite the encouraging recovery, the report indicates a slowdown in ETF activity, hinting that the initial market hype might be cooling down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) emerged as a major player on the digital asset market, recording inflows of $865 million last week. This renewed interest is attributed to new ETF issuers in the U.S., which contributed $1.8 billion in inflows. However, these gains were partially offset by Grayscale's outflows of $967 million. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products saw outflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $2 million.\n\nThe standout performer on the altcoin market last week was Solana (SOL), which saw an impressive $6.1 million in inflows. This surge reflects growing investor confidence in Solana's blockchain platform and its potential to offer innovative solutions in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Moreover, this surge in inflows for Solana aligns with a bullish trend in SOL's price performance.\n\nDespite experiencing a 6.52% dip in the last 24 hours, bringing the Solana price down to $182.49, the cryptocurrency has shown impressive resilience and growth. Over the past 30 days, Solana has surged by 40.33%, demonstrating rising confidence and optimism in the platform's capabilities and future prospects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum struggles amid altcoin surge\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, faced its fourth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $19 million. This pattern is often observed following major network upgrades, indicating investor apprehension about the success and stability of these updates.\n\nOutside of Solana, altcoins witnessed a total inflow of $18.3 million last week. Other notable performers included Filecoin (FIL) with inflows of $3.9 million, Polkadot (DOT) with $2.4 million, and Chainlink (LINK) with $1.9 million. The latest data from CoinShares underscores the dynamic and often divergent nature of the digital asset market."

        "content": "In the last 30 days, Ethereum is down by 4%. Notwithstanding this, ETH holders demonstrate a tendency for liquid restaking protocols to be preferred over the likes of the traditional platform of Lido Finance. The data collected by the Dune Analytics dashboard, developed by researcher Hildobby, points to a substantial change. It shows that Lido Finance has the biggest outflow of Ethereum (ETH) regarding other peers withdrawing more than 284,800 ETH.\n\nLido, however, remains the leader in the Ethereum staking market, with a share of 29.7%. The flow of stakers is in the direction of platforms with liquid restaking options. These, among others, include Ether fi and Renzo Protocol, which received an impressive amount of inflows. Ether fi and Renzo have received over 400,000 and 280,100 Ether, respectively, making them the preferred platforms for stakers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Stakers Prefer Eigenlayer\u2019s Flexible Solutions\n\nEther fi and Renzo are currently the largest liquid restaking platforms identified by DefiLlama. Fi\u2019s total value locked (TVL) is $3.1 billion. At the same time, the investments in Renzo exceeded $2.1 billion. In total, users have locked over $8 billion in these protocols. This tendency shows a certain dominance of platforms that use mutually exclusive capabilities of Eigenlayer, thus providing for wider staking opportunities.\n\nMoving from Lido to Ether fi and Renzo is a characteristic of the increasing popularity of Eigenlayer points among the participants of DeFi. These liquid restaking protocols use the Eigenlayer framework to allow stakers of their ETH to assist other networks and solutions. This approach came into favor when the Ethereum blockchain changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake in September 2022.\n\nEigenlayer Expands Use of Staked ETH Widely\n\nWith the transition of Ethereum to proof-of-stake, the staking practice was revolutionized. Stakers are involved in securing the Ethereum chain by depositing the ETH with validators. Eigenlayer has evolved this model by enabling the staked ETH to be employed across a larger range of protocols and chains that are interconnected with Ethereum.\n\nRead Also: ProShares Introduces First Bitcoin ETF To Target 2x Daily BTC Return\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

Let\u2019s explore these avenues brimming with opportunities for the future of Ethereum.\n\nDecrypting Layer 3 in Ethereum\n\nLayer 3, or additional layers, are built on top of existing Layer 2 scaling solutions. They raise many questions about their true contribution. Indeed, they can reduce certain fixed costs associated with batch settlements and deposits/withdrawals. However, they do not \u201cmagically\u201d improve the overall transaction throughput. Therefore, their real added value in optimizing the Ethereum ecosystem in the long term should be carefully assessed. Moreover, adding this extra layer raises legitimate concerns about its potential complexity.\n\nFurthermore, some question the possible trade-offs between cost reduction and other crucial factors such as decentralization, security, and scalability.\n\nThe Emergence of Lighter Alternatives\n\nHowever, in his recent statements, Vitalik Buterin highlighted the existence of lighter alternative approaches capable of offering similar cost savings to those promised by Layer 3. In other words, there may be simpler and more effective solutions. These could solve Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues without adding a complex new layer. Although few concrete details have been provided so far, this perspective opens the door to promising new thoughts.\n\nIndeed, lighter solutions could potentially offer better compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s existing architecture. This would facilitate their adoption and integration. Moreover, they might prove easier to understand, develop, and maintain for the developer community.\n\nIn the face of scaling challenges, Ethereum must choose its path wisely. Layer 3 promises cost reduction but raises questions about their complexity and compatibility with foundational principles. The lighter alternatives mentioned by Vitalik Buterin, although not detailed, offer promising avenues for potentially simpler and more flexible solutions.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum & Milei Moneda soar as Solana eyes $260 peak - crypto.news",
        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nMilei Moneda (MEDA) targets Uniswap launch, with investors excited about the 100% price surge from $0.010 to $0.020 in its ongoing presale.\n\nSolana integrates CCTP for blockchain interoperability; the price dips from $200 to $180, with the April 2024 outlook at $260.Ethereum addresses validator concerns, but Buterin proposes failure rate penalties.\n\nThe price rises to $3,000 and may reach $5,000 by May. In the world of cryptocurrency, Solana, Ethereum, and Milei Moneda are making waves with their recent developments. From integrations to proposals and upcoming launches, each holds the promise of shaping the future of the market in unique ways.\n\nYou might also like: Developer activity rises on Cardano; Milei Moneda eyes growth\n\nSolana integrates circle\u2019s CCTP, sees decline\n\nIn a move set to enhance interoperability across blockchain ecosystems, Solana has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).\n\nThis partnership enables developers on the Solana ecosystem to seamlessly exchange USDC tokens with Ethereum and other leading blockchains directly. The integration underscores Solana\u2019s commitment to fostering a more interconnected DeFi landscape as one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this positive development, SOL experienced a decline from the $200 region to the $180 region in March 2024. This dip reflects broader market volatility, with several other cryptocurrencies also witnessing declines. Experts still set an optimistic eye on the $260 mark by April 2024.\n\nNotably, Solana\u2019s recent integration with CCTP positions it as a top ten cryptocurrency in the ongoing efforts to improve cross-chain interoperability and expand the utility of digital assets.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, partnerships like this one by Solana highlight the importance of collaboration in driving innovation and adoption within the industry.\n\nEthereum validators face decentralization challenges\n\nRecent discussions among Ethereum stakeholders have highlighted concerns regarding the increasing number of validators on the network. Venture investor Evan Van Ness and staking pool operator Gabriel Weide caution that an overabundance of validators could lead to failed transactions, potentially undermining the Ethereum network\u2019s reliability.\n\nPeter Kim, head of engineering at Coinbase Wallet, acknowledges the impressive growth in the number of validators but notes that the current limit of 32 ETH per validator may be artificially inflating this figure. However, he suggests that changes to this limit on the Ethereum network may be imminent.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a solution to enhance network decentralization. Buterin\u2019s proposal involves penalizing validators in proportion to their average failure rate, aiming to level the playing field between large and small Ethereum stakers.\n\nYou might also like: Milei Moneda sees investor interest as Solana, Toncoin, surge\n\nDespite these controversies, Ethereum moved from the $2,000 region to the $3,000 region between February and March 2024. Experts are optimistic that the project will continue soaring to even the $5,000 region again by May 2024, hence creating a new ATH.\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) continues to navigate issues of scalability and decentralization, Buterin\u2019s proposal offers a potential path forward to address these concerns and ensure the network\u2019s long-term viability, proving to be the best crypto to buy.\n\nMilei Moneda (MEDA): A rising project with innovation\n\nMilei Moneda, one of the top DeFi projects of 2024, is poised for a significant milestone as it prepares to debut on Uniswap in May 2024.\n\nWith a focus on economic freedom and peer-to-peer markets, Milei Moneda stands out as one of the top crypto coins for its deflationary token model and integration of popular NFTs, making it the best crypto investment.\n\nAnticipation is high among investors, who expect a 100% surge in price from $0.010 to $0.020 once it launches. By boasting a total token supply of 500,000,000, the project prioritizes accessibility, liquidity, and rewards, aiming to carve out a top spot among the top altcoins.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, Milei Moneda emerges as a compelling option, offering both profit potential and alignment with current market trends in DeFi.\n\nWith Solana eyeing $260, Ethereum addressing decentralization, and Milei Moneda promising an economic revolution, the crypto frenzy continues.\n\nWhether it\u2019s exploring established giants or betting on rising stars, the journey through the crypto space promises both challenges and rewards for those willing to embrace its dynamic nature.\n\nTo learn more about this project, visit the Milei Moneda presale or join the community"

        "content": "The US Dollar\u2019s strength is one of the reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) is showing weakness. A spike in buying pressure for the Greeback suggests that the market is risk-off, which could result in a negative impact on risky assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nSolana\u2019s (SOL) price falls sharply on Tuesday, influenced by the steep decline in Bitcoin prices, even though the altcoin registered $6.1 million in inflows from institutional investors last week. While the recent meme coin frenzy may have benefited Solana and attracted capital last week, a recent drop in on-chain activity and a slowdown in inflows could be behind the recent price decline.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price reached a low of $3,362 on Tuesday after a decline in Bitcoin sent a large part of the crypto market into the red zone. ETH started the second quarter in the red, although historical data suggests that Q2 has been an averagely good month for the largest altcoin. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin's post explaining how The Purge could boost Ethereum's decentralization could also indicate long-term growth.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum 'Purge' Plans - Blockhead",
        "content": "Vitalik Buterin has laid out new steps for Ethereum's 'Purge' to improve the blockchain's efficiency.\n\nIn a blog post written by Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder detailed how upcoming initiatives, known as The Purge, will refine the protocol.\n\nThe Purge removes excess and obsolete network history to simplify its process while introducing new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to streamline operations and security.\n\nA quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka \"the Purge\"):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024\n\nEIP-6780 is central to the Purge and aims to reduce \" the functionality of the 'selfdestruct' opcode, which destroys the contract that calls it and empties its code and storage, so that it only works if the contract was created during the same transaction. \"\n\nEliminating the selfdestruct code will enable each Ethereum block to have more storage slots.\n\nBuilding upon Ethereum's recent update, Dencun, the blockchain will see Ethereum blocks being removed from Ethereum nodes through EIP-4444.\n\n\u201cPotentially, if each node stores small percentages of the history by default, we could even have roughly as many copies of each specific piece of history stored across the network as we do today,\u201d Buterin said, attaching a meme to his blog post:\n\nBy reducing the amount of storage needed to run an Ethereum node will in turn reduce the amount of people required to do it. EIP-4444 simplifies the workflow of node operators and increases Ethereum node decentralization.\n\nA LOG reform is proposed by Buterin to address inefficiencies in decentralized applications.\n\n\u201cOur current mechanism is too slow, pushing dApps towards centralized solutions. By simplifying the LOG opcode and leveraging ZK-SNARKs, we can create a more efficient and decentralized framework for accessing logs,\u201d Buterin says.\n\nHe also announced that Ethereum consensus layer is moving to SimpleSerialize (SSZ).\n\nSSZ offers simplicity, efficiency, and compatibility with various applications. It offers shorter and more efficient Merkle proofs, ensuring better performance and reducing computational load.\n\n\"These efforts are about more than simplification; they\u2019re about ensuring Ethereum\u2019s resilience and adaptability in the face of future challenges,\u201d Buterin concludes.\n\nAs Ethereum improves its technical capabilities, institutions are highly anticipating the SEC's approval of ETH ETFs.\n\nA few days ago, Bitwise filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC but expressed hope for the regulator to delay their decision until the end of the year."

        "content": "Skywards, a prominent entity within the DeFi ecosystem, has put forth a proposal to integrate the staked version of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar, sUSDe, into Aave V3 on Ethereum. This proposal follows a consensus reached during the TEMP CHECK stage, signaling potential enhancements to the Aave protocol.\n\nSkywards Seeks To Add sUSDe To Aave V3 On Ethereum\n\nsUSDe offers a stable crypto-native solution with lucrative yield-earning opportunities, making it an attractive asset for borrowers within the Aave ecosystem. The proposed contract address for sUSDe is 0x9d\u2026 with plans to implement an oracle through CAPO to ensure reliable price feeds.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRisk parameters for the integration will be provided by Chaos Labs, underscoring Aave\u2019s commitment to robust risk management practices. Notably, Skywards is driving this proposal, emphasizing community-driven decision-making and transparency in governance processes.\n\nThe proposal marks a significant step forward in expanding Aave\u2019s offerings and attracting a diverse range of users seeking stable and yield-generating assets within the DeFi landscape. As the proposal advances, community and service provider feedback will play a crucial role in shaping the final decision.\n\nIf the response remains positive, the proposal will progress to the ARFC snapshot stage, followed by an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement. If the proposal passes the governance process of Aave V3 on Ethereum, potentially reshaping the DeFi landscape.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Co-Founder Unveils Protocol Simplification Strategy \u201cThe Purge\u201d\n\nProposal For Adding Renzo Protocol\u2019s ezETH to Aave V3\n\nEarlier, Aave revealed that a temporary check on community sentiment is underway to gauge interest in adding support for Renzo Protocol\u2019s Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH on Aave V3 Ethereum. The proposal aims to introduce a new asset class to Aave and enhance the diversity of the lending and staking category.\n\nLiquid Restaking tokens (LRTs) have gained significant popularity recently due to their productivity as staking assets. These tokens are highly correlated with Ethereum and are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH for yield leveraged staking strategies, particularly with the introduction of eMode.\n\nThe integration of ezETH into Aave is expected to increase demand for ezETH, resulting in boosted revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol. Moreover, it\u2019s anticipated to enhance liquidity and peg stability for ezETH. The proposal highlights relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) for Renzo Protocol, including Total Value Locked ($1.9 billion), Total supply (526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH), and 24-hour trading volume ($80.2 million).\n\nIf consensus is reached during this temporary check, the proposal will escalate to subsequent stages, including Snapshot and ARFC, before final confirmation through an AIP vote. For further details and documentation, interested parties can refer to Renzo Protocol\u2019s resources, including their website, documentation, GitHub repository, audits, and Chainlink Data Feed.\n\nAlso Read: Hacker Calls for Live Apology from Prisma Finance Post $11M Heist\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.
