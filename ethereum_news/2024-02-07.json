        "title": "SEC may be forced to declare Ethereum a security after controversial new launch - Fortune",
        "content": "Prometheum plans to announce on Wednesday the launch of custodial services for Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, whose $280 billion market cap is second only to Bitcoin\u2019s. The move may be part of a larger strategy by the crypto firm to get regulators to identify Ether as a security\u2014a position widely unpopular among industry peers.\n\nSo far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has avoided taking a position on Ethereum\u2019s legal status even while declaring more than a dozen other popular cryptocurrencies to be securities. The latest gambit by New York\u2013based Prometheum, which claims it has discovered a compliant path for crypto within existing laws, could force the agency\u2019s hand.\n\nLegal experts have told Fortune that Prometheum\u2019s plan to launch its custodial service may compel the SEC to resolve the long-running Ethereum question. If the agency does indeed proclaim Ether to be a security, Prometheum could be in a pole position when it launches its planned trading platform next quarter\u2014even as the rest of the industry insists crypto can\u2019t be viable without new laws.\n\nA controversial new player\n\nLongtime crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken offer trading platforms in the U.S., allowing users to buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. While many of the firms have been around for more than a decade, they still operate outside the regulatory framework of the existing financial system, which has led lawmakers to propose new rules for the industry.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has stepped up enforcement after the disastrous collapse of FTX, has said existing rules are sufficient and filed lawsuits against exchanges for failing to register with the agency. In response, companies like Coinbase have argued that the existing rules are outdated.\n\nWhile much of the U.S. crypto industry has sided with Coinbase, Prometheum has taken a different\u2014and contentious\u2014approach.\n\nFounded by two brothers, Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum received regulatory approval in 2021 to operate an alternative trading platform\u2014similar to a stock exchange\u2014where users can buy and sell different securities. The company went on to gain widespread attention in mid-2023 when it announced a first-of-its-kind approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u2014an industry oversight body that\u2019s independent of the SEC\u2014to operate as a special purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. The SEC first created the designation in 2021, but no other firm has succeeded in obtaining a license, though others, including Robinhood, have tried.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claim to have found a compliant path for crypto trading immediately drew condemnation from legal figures in the crypto industry, who argued that even if the SEC and FINRA approved Prometheum\u2019s structure, it would not have any assets available for trading. That is because, skeptics argue, the SEC has jurisdiction over securities, while cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ether are more like oil or gold\u2014assets that don\u2019t fit the legal definition of a security and so can\u2019t be registered.\n\nThe Kaplan brothers, in contrast, agree with the SEC\u2019s assessment that most cryptocurrencies are securities. They argue that Prometheum will be able to list different crypto assets as securities under an exemption called Rule 144, which is used to trade restricted stocks, and that they can use blockchain data to determine whether the assets have been in circulation for more than a year\u2014a key factor for the exemption. As an alternative trading system (or ATS), Prometheum will not have to work directly with the issuers but instead can choose which assets to list.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claims have not only riled the crypto industry but Republican lawmakers, who have argued that Gensler had propped up the little-known firm to further his own regulatory agenda. In a June appearance on CNBC, for instance, Gensler touted Prometheum\u2019s registration as a special purpose broker-dealer as an example of a compliant path for the industry. And last June, the company received a prized invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto despite having virtually no presence in the industry.\n\nThe debate over Prometheum\u2019s proposal has until now been theoretical, but Wednesday\u2019s announcement of Ether custodial services, which are slated to launch by late March for institutional clients, means the company is on the cusp of becoming the first crypto exchange to compliantly offer assets like Ether for trading.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with the crypto industry,\u201d Benjamin Kaplan said in an interview with Fortune. \u201cOur goal is not to destroy, it\u2019s not to harm, it\u2019s not to undermine\u2014it\u2019s to help build.\u201d\n\n\u2018Move the ball forward\u2019\n\nIn the traditional world of stock markets, the various steps that make up a trade are divided among different firms. For instance, a retail trader visits a broker like Fidelity to buy a share of Apple stock, leading Fidelity to turn to a broker-dealer like Citadel Securities to fill the order. Next, a firm called the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, figures out who owes what in all the trades the broker has made that day\u2014a process known as clearing.\n\nAt this point, another DTCC subsidiary called the Depository Trust Company steps in to oversee the funds and securities moving from one party to another\u2014a process called settlement. Finally, an institution\u2014either the original broker or a firm like State Street or BNY Mellon\u2014serves as the custodian, meaning it holds the actual securities on behalf of the investors.\n\nOne of the reasons for separating these various functions is to prevent conflicts of interest. If Citadel, for example, was serving as both an exchange and a broker-dealer, it could digest customer trade information and front-run orders. Separating brokers into distinct entities also prevents markets from having a single point of failure, as happened with FTX.\n\nJames Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown focused on financial regulation, told Fortune that much of the separation is also historical\u2014a convention that the crypto industry is seeking to disrupt with the help of blockchain technology.\n\nFirms like Coinbase offer clearing, settling, custody, and trading services under one roof, an arrangement that provided partial fodder for the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against the exchange. The agency\u2019s primary complaint, though, was that Coinbase and others had not registered with the SEC to offer any of these services\u2014even as it sold what the agency deemed to be securities.\n\nPrometheum, meanwhile, believes it has found a way to sell crypto without triggering any of these objections from the SEC, in part by dividing itself into two entities.\n\nOne, the alternative trading system, is a member of FINRA and registered with the SEC, and will provide a front-end platform for investors to buy and sell crypto assets. The other entity, Prometheum Capital, is the company that received the special purpose broker-dealer license and a final go-ahead from FINRA in January to offer the clearing, settling, and custody services necessary to complete the trades.\n\nThe upshot is that, while firms like Coinbase have been battling with the SEC, Prometheum has been getting approvals from FINRA, which is nominally independent of the agency but also works closely with the SEC and is ultimately subject to its oversight. It is also notable that, while other firms have applied to receive the special purpose broker-dealer license\u2014the one created by the SEC in 2021 and issued by FINRA\u2014Prometheum is the only one to receive it.\n\nNow, Prometheum\u2019s custodial services for Ether announcement suggests the company is on track to offer the popular cryptocurrency for trading to institutional investors later this spring. More consequentially, by offering custodial services for Ether, Prometheum is claiming that Ether is a security\u2014a critical question that the SEC has yet to decide on\u2014and doing so as a FINRA- and SEC-regulated business.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to custody before you trade,\u201d Aaron Kaplan told Fortune. \u201cThis is hopefully going to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a gamble\u2019\n\nFortune spoke with four lawyers and academics with expertise in digital asset regulation who agreed that Prometheum\u2019s custody launch could lead the SEC to finally rule on Ethereum\u2019s legal status, especially because Prometheum prominently displays its registered status with the two organizations on its website\u2014a decision that Boston University lecturer Mark Williams described as \u201cmarketing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d Williams told Fortune. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s part of their business strategy to force the hand of the SEC.\u201d\n\nWilliam Brannan, vice chair of the crypto practice at Lowenstein Sandler, said that Prometheum would be creating \u201cunnecessary controversy\u201d by announcing Ether as the first asset it would custody, given the SEC\u2019s reluctance to take a stance on it.\n\nEven though Prometheum\u2019s primary regulator is FINRA, which operates separately from the SEC, Brannan said FINRA likely would be working with the SEC on the question of Prometheum\u2019s launch of Ether custodial services, owing to the decision\u2019s magnitude.\n\n\u201cMy hunch would be that, particularly for these types of issues, FINRA is in very close contact and consultation with the SEC, and would likely be liaising with them and seeking to get some clarification on their position,\u201d Brannan told Fortune.\n\nAccording to a company spokesperson, since Prometheum received the special purpose broker-dealer license from FINRA, it doesn\u2019t require further approval to make assets available for custody, but it has informed FINRA of its plans to offer services for ETH.\n\nSpokespersons from FINRA and the SEC both declined to comment when reached by Fortune.\n\nIf the SEC took action to stop the offering, it would likely come after Prometheum launched its custodial services for Ether. Still, Ron Geffner, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg and a former SEC enforcement attorney, said that he does not expect the SEC to block Prometheum\u2019s approach given Gensler\u2019s stated desire to find a company that can operate under the SEC\u2019s preferred guardrails. \u201cThe SEC, given their position on crypto being a security, wants successful registrants in the marketplace that are complying with federal securities laws and supporting their position,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThe question remains whether Prometheum can draw investor interest\u2014and whether its approach will survive subsequent SEC administrations. The Kaplan brothers argue that creating a compliant approach will drive institutional participation in the crypto industry, although they haven\u2019t specified if the trading platform has potential clients lined up. Williams expressed skepticism that Prometheum would pull off its bold move. \u201cThey\u2019re not market-tested, so I would just have some caution in regard to their ability,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nBut even if Prometheum can\u2019t drum up demand, or running the operation proves too expensive, a successful launch could upend the industry\u2019s argument that crypto is incompatible with existing securities laws. And that clarity, Brannan said, wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of value,\u201d he told Fortune, \u201cin just knowing exactly what the rules of the road are.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Approval Expected In May: How Will ETH Price React? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In early 2024, the Securities and Exchange (SEC) approved the launch of over 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a landmark decision. In the months leading up to the announcement, the price of Bitcoin rose dramatically, going from less than $30,000 in late October to above $48,000 in early January. Additionally, the ETFs attracted tens of billions in investment.\n\nThough this decision was limited to Bitcoin, the ruling opened the door for the possibility of other spot ETFs. Perhaps the most anticipated is Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum had a strong year, appreciating nearly 100%. However, these gains are much smaller than Bitcoin, which appreciated over 150%. Some believe that the hype surrounding the Bitcoin ETFs, as well as other factors, propelled both Bitcoin and Ethereum higher and higher throughout 2023.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin dropped off sharply after the approval of the ETFs. While it has begun to slowly recover, it is still far from the highs it saw on the first day the spot ETFs traded. While this fall in price could be for several reasons, most believe it to be a sell-the-news event, as the approvals were largely known and there was some profit taking on certain ETFs, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nEthereum ETFs could also be a possibility soon. According to Standard Chartered, the ETFs could be approved on May 23. This is the final deadline for the first wave of applications. This is notable as the Bitcoin ETFs were approved on the final deadline.\n\nTo support its case, Standard Chartered looked at the SEC's stance on ETH. The SEC has not classified ETH as a security in other filings. Additionally, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has a listed and regulated ETH futures contract.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nWhile this seems to be positive for both the potential approval of an ETF and ETH in general, there is no guarantee that it will be approved.\n\nAnother interesting piece to consider is the planned Ethereum upgrades, expected to go live in the first quarter of 2024. The upgrades are set to focus on scalability, speed, security and a whole host of other features. The last upgrade was in April 2023 and provided a slight boost to the price.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining the different variables of the potential for ETF approval and price a runup ahead before May, as well as the planned Ethereum upgrades, it is hard to say exactly where the price of ETH will go. Drawing from the outcome of the Bitcoin ETFs, it might not be unreasonable to see a sharp price increase over the next several months before a sell-off in May. Standard Chartered predicts that the price of ETH could increase to $4,000 by May 23.\n\nOn the other hand, the market may look back at the Bitcoin ETF saga and change the second time around. In this case, a starkly different situation than with the Bitcoin ETFs could occur.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum ETF Approval Expected In May: How Will ETH Price React? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA quarter of all Ethereum (ETH) in supply is now being staked, data shows. According to figures from blockchain data firm Nansen, over 30 million ETH\u2014or about $74 billion worth of the cryptocurrency\u2014has been locked up.\n\nStaking is the process of \u201clocking up\u201d digital coins or tokens to help keep a blockchain network running. Proof-of-stake assets like ETH require users to pledge their coins to the network by sending it to a specific blockchain address. Those who stake earn token rewards in the process.\n\nLast year, the Ethereum network was upgraded, allowing users to easily withdraw staked ETH. Since then, liquid staking protocols have boomed\u2014allowing users to seamlessly lock up and withdraw their crypto.\n\nAs ETH enthusiasts eagerly await the approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that brings the second-largest digital asset to Wall Street, applicants are talking about staking in their proposals. Yesterday, investment firm Ark 21Shares amended their spot ETH ETF S-1 to mention the practice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the trust\u2019s assets through one or more trusted staking providers,\u201d the filing read.\n\nStaking is controversial with regulators, though: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has fined major crypto companies\u2014such as digital asset exchanges Kraken and Coinbase\u2014for allegedly selling unregistered securities via staking services.\n\nThe Ethereum network is in the process of an upgrade, too. Developers this week finalized the Dencun upgrade on a testnet. It is now expected to go live on the mainnet by March 13.\n\nDevelopers claim that Dencun will solve the scalability problem of the network behind the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency\u2014which is slow and expensive\u2014so that it will potentially be able to process over 100,000 transactions per second in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Avalanche Vs. Ethereum (2024 Edition) - Securities.io",
        "content": "Every day, more investors show interest in the smart programmable blockchain sector. These networks enable developers to create immersive and unique Dapps to service the market. As such, they are incredibly popular. Both Avalanche and Ethereum are major contenders in this field. Here's everything you need to know regarding Avalanche (AVAX) vs Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat is Avalanche?\n\nAvalanche is an advanced DeFi (decentralized finance) enabled protocol. The network leverages a multi-chain approach to reduce fees and improve programmability. Avalanche was built to help alleviate many of the problems Ethereum developers encounter, including scalability issues. As such, it has specific features geared towards onboarding developers from Ethereum to the Avalanche system.\n\nAvalanche was created by Ava Labs, which is led by Cornell researcher Emin G\u00fcn Sirer. The project's mainnet officially launched in September 2020. The team behind the Avalanche project went to great lengths to ensure the protocol had far superior scalability than Ethereum and was easy for users to navigate and leverage.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum changed the crypto market forever as it was the first second-generation blockchain to enter the market. This protocol was revolutionary as it demonstrated the concept of smart contracts. As such, Ethereum has been a pioneering force in the market. It has helped to drive innovation with the launch of the ERC-20 token standard and more.\n\nToday, Ethereum operates as the largest and most diverse DeFi ecosystem in the world. It\u2019s also the largest Dapp network in use. These facts make Ethereum one of the most important blockchain in the market.\n\nWhat Problems Was Avalanche Built to Alleviate?\n\nAvalanche was built to reduce many of the problems faced by Ethereum users. The protocol combines 3 separate blockchains to accomplish this task. As part of this strategy, the network introduces a multi-language approach to programming. Specifically, Avalanche developers can program smart contracts using multiple virtual machines.\n\nAnother problem that Avalanche helps to alleviate is Ethereum\u2019s lack of support for compliant Dapps. Compliant Dapps are protocols that follow complex rule sets. These rule sets are usually a part of some regulatory requirement. The Avalanche network enables developers to determine how each asset is traded, shared, and hosted for the project's life, making it ideal for Dapps servicing highly regulated industries.\n\nWhat Problems Was Ethereum Built to Alleviate?\n\nEthereum was designed to fight centralization. The network was the first to support smart contract programmability and Dapp creation. As such, it has served a vital role in demonstrating how decentralized networks improve on their centralized counterparts. The system was designed to be flexible from day one. Developers can create Dapps using multiple programming languages, including C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and more.\n\nHow Does Avalanche Work?\n\nAvalanche combines three separate blockchain networks to achieve superior scalability and functionality. The protocol operates as a frictionless payment system, cryptocurrency, and DeFi ecosystem. The 3 blockchains, the X-chain, C-chain, and P-chain all serve different roles in the network. Together they empower Avalanche developers to create more robust Dapps.\n\nX-chain\n\nThe X-chain is the network that is responsible for the issuance of new digital assets. This network supports the creation of new tokens, NFTs Non-fungible tokens, stablecoins, and more. Users can utilize AVAX to collateralize these assets.\n\nC-chain\n\nThe C-chain is designed to improve Ethereum developer onboarding. The developers describe this network as a conversion chain. It features a bunch of protocols to help Ethereum developers seamlessly convert their Dapps to Avalanche.\n\nP-chain\n\nThe P-chain is responsible for monitoring and validating the state of subnets. These Avalanche-powered blockchains can be set up to meet nearly any need. P-chain is also responsible for hosting many of the network's DeFi features such as its staking protocols.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum operates as a layer one blockchain. Notably, Ethereum isn\u2019t a cryptocurrency, as many believe. It's the network that Ether (ETH), the network's utility token, resides on. It leverages a network of participants known as nodes to compute smart contract equations and host data. For their efforts, these nodes receive rewards in the form of ETH based on their contribution level.\n\nAvalanche Consensus\n\nAvalanche integrates a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. PoS systems are far more energy-efficient than PoW systems because they don't rely on miners to remain valid. Instead, users stake their AVAX to qualify as Validator nodes. These nodes run virtual machines and add blocks of transactions to the blockchain.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) vs Ethereum (ETH)\n\nPoS systems are more democratic than PoW systems because they don\u2019t require users to purchase expensive mining equipment or compete against each other to earn rewards. In a PoS system, users simply stake their tokens in a network wallet to help ensure the system remains secure.\n\nEthereum Consensus\n\nWhile Ethereum originally utilized a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism known as the Ethash algorithm, it has since transitioned to become a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. This event, which occurred in 2022, was viewed as a major upgrade, often referred to as the launch of Ethereum 2.0. It marked Ethereum's shift towards greater energy efficiency, scalability, and security.\n\nValidators are now responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks, requiring a stake of 32 ETH for participation or the option to join a staking pool. This transition signifies Ethereum's commitment to sustainability and long-term scalability improvements. As such, users can stake their Ethereum to become Validators. To become a validator on Ethereum, you need to stake 32 ETH. If you don\u2019t have this much ETH, you can leverage mining pools to combine your tokens with others and split the rewards.\n\nScalability\n\nIn terms of scalability, Avalanche is the clear winner. The network's multi-chain design provides excellent linear scalability. The protocol is capable of sub-second transaction times. According to company bench tests, Avalanche can support up to 6,500 transactions per second and can scale to millions.\n\nEthereum can handle around 15-45 transactions per second (TPS) in its current state. It takes 35 network confirmations to finalize Ethereum transactions. By transitioning to PoS, Ethereum has opened the door to advanced features like sharding, that will, in time, vastly improve its TPS ability.\n\nFees\n\nIn terms of gas fees, Avalanche wins again. The network provides developers and users with some of the lowest fees of any programmable network. Users pay minuscule fees for minting new assets and creating blockchains. These fees are then sent to a burn address. These actions help to bolster the price of AVAX as they reduce the total supply of the token in circulation, which helps drive up demand.\n\nThe Ethereum network fees increase when it becomes busier due to the technical structure of the protocol. Ethereum is set up to increase fees alongside congestion as a means to reduce spam posts from the blockchain. However, the recent explosion in DeFi protocols has meant that the majority of traffic on the Ethereum blockchain isn't spam but rather legitimate platforms. As such, this system has become counter-productive.\n\nDeFi Features\n\nAvalanche provides users with full DeFi functionality. The protocol supports all the latest features, including peer-to-peer lending, staking, farming, and more. All DeFi rewards are paid out in AVAX, which can then be added to the primary staking balance to improve returns. In the end, you create a wealth-generation cycle using this approach.\n\nEthereum is the largest DeFi network in the world. Despite its technical limitations, Ethereum has managed to support every DeFi service created. The network enables users to interact within the entire ERC-20 ecosystem in a seamless manner. All ERC-20 compatible apps can leverage the growing number of DEXs, DeFi lending protocols, staking, farming pools, and more.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) vs Ethereum (ETH)\n\nTokens\n\nAVAX is the main utility token for the Avalanche ecosystem. This flexible token can be used to pay fees, send value globally in a frictionless manner, and collateralize new assets and blockchain. Avax features superior scalability when compared to ETH. The token can also be staked to secure low-risk rewards.\n\nETH is the primary utility token of the Ethereum network. This token's purpose is to pay for instances of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). ETH is one of the most popular tokens in the market. It's listed on nearly every exchange and is among the most popular tokens in the world. You can use ETH to participate in ICOs (initial coin offerings). It's also used to compensate validators for their support.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX)\n\nCurrently, both Avalanche (AVAX) and Ethereum (ETH) are available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nUpdated Tech vs. a Massive Community\n\nThe battle between Avalanche and Ethereum is nowhere close to over, and both networks have bright futures.

        "content": "Today UBS announced the issuance of an investment-grade tokenized warrant in Hong Kong on the Ethereum public blockchain. It used the UBS Tokenize issuance solution. It was a call warrant on Xiaomi stock and was sold to OSL Digital Securities.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the UBS tokenized warrant reinforces the bank\u2019s position as the leading derivative products issuer in Hong Kong,\u201d said Winni Cheuk, Head of Sales, APAC Public Distribution, UBS Global Markets. \u201cCreated natively on a public blockchain in a permissioned environment, this innovative product enhances transparency, reduces transaction fees, streamlines settlement processes, and allows for more flexible trading hours.\u201d\n\nUBS has long been active in the institutional DLT space \u2013 it was cofounder of the institutional payment system Fnality. Recently it has been flexing its muscles in web3.\n\nUBS\u2019s expanding tokenization initiatives\n\nIn late 2022 UBS Wealth Management issued $50 million in digital debt securities to Asian high net worth individuals. That was followed last year by the Bank of China Investment (BOCI) issuing digital structured notes on Ethereum using the UBS Tokenize platform.\n\nAdditionally, UBS participated in multiple public blockchain trials as part of Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian. One involved a pilot for a tokenized money market fund issued on Ethereum. Another was for cross border repo \u2013 the sale and repurchase of a natively issued digital bond on a public blockchain. SBI and DBS partnered for the experiment, which spanned Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland.\n\nBeyond public blockchain trials, UBS is in production with intraday cross border repo. It was one of the first banks to adopt Broadridge\u2019s Distributed Ledger Repo (DLR), a permissioned blockchain infrastructure. A few months before the Project Guardian repo, UBS used DLR for a cross border intraday repo involving an Asian bank.\n\nIn related news, UBS is one of the five banks participating in Hong Kong\u2019s second government digital green bond issuance. Goldman Sachs\u2019 tokenization platform was used for the first bond, with HSBC\u2019s Orion for the second. Hence, UBS Tokenize could be used in a future issuance."

        "title": "What is Ethereum fragmentation? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s evolution is marked by the adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s), designed to alleviate the network\u2019s congestion and high transaction fees.\n\nL2s operate on top of Ethereum (Layer 1 or L1), processing transactions more efficiently before finalizing them on the main chain. However, this has led to a new challenge: each L2 functions in its isolated environment, creating silos that hinder interoperability\u2014a state we refer to as fragmentation.\n\nWhat is Universal Synchronous Composability (USC)?\n\nThe core issue with fragmentation is the loss of \u201cuniversal synchronous composability\u201d (USC), a feature allowing different applications to interact with each other seamlessly in real time. Imagine Ethereum as a bustling city where roads (L2s) connect buildings (applications).\n\nFragmentation is akin to having roads that don\u2019t interconnect, forcing you to take a long detour to move from one building to another.\n\nThe proposed solution, \u201cshared sequencing,\u201d is like establishing a city-wide transit system that links all roads, enabling direct travel routes between any two points without detours.\n\nTo further simplify, consider shared sequencing as the internet of Ethereum. Just as the internet allows different computers to communicate directly regardless of their physical location, shared sequencing enables different L2s to interact seamlessly. This system removes barriers, allowing for immediate transactions across the network, akin to sending an email from one side of the world to the other in seconds.\n\nTechnical Explanation of Shared Sequencing\n\nShared sequencing coordinates the order of transactions across all L2 solutions on Ethereum. It uses a centralized mechanism to sequence transactions identically across different L2s without requiring major infrastructure changes.\n\nShared sequencing leverages Ethereum\u2019s existing data availability capabilities. It proposes adding functionality for L2 solutions to sequence transactions in a unified manner. By sequencing transactions in the same order everywhere, shared sequencing enables instant interactions between L2s across Ethereum.\n\nPotential Use Cases for Shared Sequencing\n\nAdopting shared sequencing could revolutionize Ethereum. It would enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs by enabling seamless communication between L2 solutions. This would eliminate the need for complex bridging between L2s.\n\nShared sequencing could enable more robust decentralized applications (dApps) and services that integrate across L2s. This would improve user experience and accessibility. By restoring composability across L2 solutions, shared sequencing would strengthen Ethereum\u2019s network effects and dominance as a platform for blockchain applications.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey through fragmentation may resemble a challenging phase of growth, the horizon holds promise for a unified and efficient ecosystem. Shared sequencing represents a leap towards realizing this vision, offering a roadmap to re-establish Ethereum\u2019s composability and network effects.\n\nAs we look to the future, continued innovation and collaboration within the Ethereum community will be pivotal in overcoming current limitations and unlocking the platform\u2019s full potential. Through these efforts, Ethereum can evolve into a more interconnected and powerful platform, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain applications."

This contrasts with the SEC's current stance on Ethereum.\n\nPrometheum's strategy could lead to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refining its stance on Ethereum, potentially giving Prometheum a competitive advantage in the marketplace, as reported by Fortune.\n\nA different approach\n\nPrometheum, a new player in the crypto industry, has taken a unique approach to regulation by obtaining approval to operate an alternative trading platform and as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities.\n\nThis approach marks a departure from the perspectives of major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken, which are advocating for amendments to the prevailing regulatory frameworks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrometheum's plan to offer Ether custody services may force the SEC to decide on Ethereum's legal status. While controversial, the move showcases regulatory compliance. Hence, Prometheum's success could redefine industry regulations, providing much-needed clarity.\n\nGensler's ambiguous stance\n\nThe stance of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on this matter has been somewhat enigmatic. In a recent interview, Gensler hinted that Ethereum (ETH) might fall under the category of a security, which marks a shift from his earlier tentative positions on the subject.\n\nGensler stressed that most cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, are often developed by entrepreneurs who employ various mechanisms to market their tokens and attract investment, with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.\n\nAccording to Gensler, this aligns with the characteristics of securities, thus placing them within the regulatory scope of the SEC. This perspective stands in contrast to the views of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)."

        "title": "The plot to make Ethereum a security\u2014and what happens next - Fortune",
        "content": "Regular readers of this newsletter know I am no fan of Prometheum, the off-brand crypto firm that claims to have found a \u201ccompliant\u201d way to offer popular cryptocurrencies under existing securities regulations. Operated by two brothers with a dubious legal pedigree, Prometheum took another step this week in its cockamamie scheme to get Ethereum declared a security and become the only authorized dealer for it. The crazy thing is that the scheme just might work\u2014for a minute at least.\n\nThe latest development is that Prometheum just announced it will begin to custody Ethereum. This is hardly unusual\u2014lots of firms custody crypto assets\u2014but for the fact that is the only company to possess a special license that lets it hold and transact in digital assets. The legal gymnastics are complicated (Leo Schwartz has an excellent rundown), but a very simplified version is that Prometheum also has a license to operate a trading platform, and that, by combining the two licenses, it can legally sling Ethereum as a security\u2014and is hoping regulators have no choice but to recognize the designation.\n\nAll of this goes against the legitimate claims of the crypto industry, which argues that blockchain is a new technology that obviates the need for the division of functions that exists in traditional securities regimes. It\u2019s also ironic that would-be crypto pioneer Prometheum doesn\u2019t appear to have spent a lick on technology, but reserved its entire outlay for legal and PR expenses. Still, if you squint your eyes, you can sort of see why the combination of the company\u2019s two licenses amount to a legal right to offer Ethereum as a security.\n\nThe question, though, is how it came to get one of those licenses\u2014in particular the special custody one\u2014in the first place. The answer is that the self-regulatory body called FINRA gave it to them. FINRA is nominally independent but still ultimately beholden to the SEC, which created the special license in the first place, and this is where the plot gets thicker.\n\nThe special crypto license, you see, was created right before current SEC Chair Gary Gensler arrived on the scene\u2014it wasn\u2019t Gensler\u2019s idea. That\u2019s probably why, during Gensler\u2019s tenure, the subordinate FINRA refused to grant the license to anyone, until suddenly Prometheum got its hands on one at a very convenient time\u2014right before firms were to testify before Congress on the futility of current crypto regulations. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, Prometheum received a plum invitation to testify. This resulted in one of the brothers giving canned testimony that echoed Gensler-style talking points about how it is possible to operate within the regulations.\n\nHmmm. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to surmise that Gensler, in his scorched-earth legal campaign against the crypto industry, leaned on FINRA to give Prometheum the special license it had denied to every other firm, including publicly traded Robinhood. Having Prometheum out there selling Ethereum as a security would suit Gensler\u2019s purposes, and it\u2019s also telling that FINRA has stayed conspicuously silent about this new \u201ccompliant\u201d crypto firm born under its watch. Sure, it might sound conspiratorial to think the wily Gensler is pulling all the strings here. But first read this thread and tell me everything is on the level.\n\nThe question now is what happens next. If Prometheum actually goes ahead and starts hosting a platform where popular cryptocurrencies are securities, the whole thing is going to be short-lived. The crypto industry will find every way it can to attack the flimsy legal theory on which Prometheum is premised, and get Gensler\u2019s SEC rung up in court again for being \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d Meanwhile, it\u2019s unclear where Prometheum is going to find customers to use its jerry-rigged platform\u2014especially with Ethereum ETFs on the way. The most likely outcome is that the company soon blows away and with it the Prometheum brothers\u2019 15 minutes of crypto fame.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBaakt, the ill-starred crypto venture launched by stock exchange giant Intercontinental, says it is almost out of cash while its share price is barely above $1.

Layer-2 scaling networks like Optimism and Arbitrum sidestepped those issues by building atop the Ethereum mainnet, but \u201crolling up\u201d many transactions into a unit that is presented to Ethereum as a single transaction.\n\nProto-danksharding will make layer-2 networks even more efficient and affordable. Developers anticipate that eventually, after danksharding\u2019s full implementation, the Ethereum ecosystem will be able to cheaply handle over 100,000 transactions a second.\n\nDencun\u2019s introduction of proto-danksharding constitutes the most substantial upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem since last April\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which allowed Ethereum stakers to withdraw funds deposited with the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile that development was obviously meaningful due to the billions of dollars worth of capital it unlocked, Dencun\u2019s implementation will, by all accounts, have a particularly substantial impact on the day-to-day functionality of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum Restaking App Approaches $4 Billion In Deposits: Biggest Airdrop In History Incoming? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "EigenLayer is a new liquid restaking platform for Ethereum. The protocol allows users to stake the same amount of Ether (ETH) across multiple projects simultaneously to earn additional rewards. Proponents of the technology say that it will increase capital efficiency and spur innovation. Those against the technology believe that it could cause overleveraging and is susceptible to slashing.\n\nThough the new technology is causing a debate among ETH enthusiasts, it is impossible to deny the project\u2019s popularity. Initially, EigenLayer put a 200,000 ETH cap on each protocol so that it could test the concept without extreme amounts of volume. The limit was removed on Feb. 5. Within 24 hours, over 700,000 ETH, or over $1.6 billion was deposited into EigenLayer. According to data from DefiLlama, this brought EigenLayer's total volume locked (TVL) to nearly $4 billion, which is over 1% of all Ethereum in circulation. For comparison, EigenLayer had less than $300 million in TVL for most of December 2023.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWhile the limit on deposits has been temporarily removed, a new limit will be put in place on February 9th. While the exact limit is unknown, it will likely be close to the TVL on February 9th. However, the project has also stated that it hopes to eventually remove any deposit limits, though this will likely happen some time in the future, if it happens at all.\n\nOn February 5th, ETH appreciated more than 3.5%, causing its market cap to approach $300 billion. Despite the strong day, ETH was still down more than 1% over the previous 7 days.\n\nTo make the project even more enticing, EigenLayer has begun showing EigenLayer Points, which are a calculation consisting of the time spent restaking, volume restaked, etc. to formulate a numerical value. While there is no guarantee that this could lead to an airdrop, other staking platforms have used a similar system in the past to mete out tokens in the event of an airdrop. One example from recent memory was the Jito (JITO) airdrop on the Solana chain. This project also used a point system, which allowed users to be placed into tiers that gave different amounts of JITO on the day of the airdrop. Again, there is no guarantee that EigenLayer will use the points system for an airdrop, but it has been used in the past.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nEigenLayer and restaking is certainly an interesting system, especially considering the potential for spot Ethereum ETFs and Ethereum chain upgrades potentially coming soon. As the protocol continues to grow and we start to see its use cases, we will gain a better understanding of where liquid restaking could potentially play a role in the future of blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum Restaking App Approaches $4 Billion In Deposits: Biggest Airdrop In History Incoming? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "EigenLayer reopened deposits and saw its market size double to $4 billion in just two days.\n\nUsers are rushing to the protocol to position themselves for any whiff of a possible airdrop.\n\nThe restaking protocol is currently sitting on top of 1.5% of Ethereum\u2019s total available supply.\n\nEigenLayer is becoming a black hole for Ether liquidity.\n\nInvestors are rushing to deposit their staked Ether after the protocol reopened deposits this week.\n\nThe restaking protocol has rocketed to $4 billion in deposits, almost double the value of locked-in investments before its latest deposit resumption.\n\nEigenLayer has been periodically raising its deposit limit as part of its staggered launch, which began in June.\n\nThis week\u2019s growth now makes it the sixth-largest DeFi protocol by investor deposits and a mere $142 million from overtaking decentralised exchange giant Uniswap.\n\nEigenLayer deposits soar to $4 billion\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s $4 billion market size comes from the almost 1.8 million Ether amassed by the protocol thus far \u2014 about 1.5% of Ethereum\u2019s total circulating supply worth $284 billion.\n\nEigenLayer is the biggest player in the niche restaking market, which is attracting significant interest as DeFi\u2019s latest meta.\n\nInvestors are also pouring in on hopes of future rewards in the form of an airdrop.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEarly depositors to EigenLayer earn points for restaking on the protocol. Many expect these points will be converted to airdrop rewards if EigenLayer launches a native token.\n\nEigenLayer deposits come in natively-staked Ether and several forms of liquid-staked Ether. The former refers to Ether staked directly on the Ethereum network, while the latter applies to Ether previously locked in several liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Swell.\n\nRestaking is an extension of the popular liquid staking market which currently worth $35.3 billion, according to DefiLlama.\n\nLiquid staking emerged as a convenient alternative to staking Ether directly to the Ethereum network. Instead, after depositing your holdings with a liquid staking provider \u2013 like Lido or Rocket Pool \u2013 you get a token in exchange. This token acts like a receipt of your staking deposit and is pegged to the price of the original-blend Ethereum.\n\nImportantly, this staked version of Ether \u2013 also called an LST \u2013 can be reused in DeFi to continue earning yield or as collateral to mint stablecoins.\n\nRestaking adds another step to this process. LST holders can stake those deposit tokens in a protocol like EigenLayer and potentially rake in yet more yield.\n\nRestaked Ether provides pooled security that extends Ethereum\u2019s security architecture across more Ethereum apps and even other blockchains.\n\nLiquid staking wars heat up\n\nJostling for points and potential airdrops on EigenLayer has also triggered competition among the litany of liquid staking protocols on Ethereum.\n\nEigenLayer previously accepted liquid-staked Ether deposits from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase. But the protocol has expanded this deposit set to include nine others.\n\nMarket values of liquid staking protocols\n\nLido\u2019s staked Ether, represented by stETH, is the most popular LST deposit on EigenLayer at 579,062 stETH, worth $1.3 billion \u2014 almost a third of the pool \u2014 almost as much as the natively restaked ETH in the protocol.\n\nOthers like Swell\u2019s swETH and Stader Labs\u2019 ETHx hope to attract deposits using incentives such as boosted EigenLayer points. These two are the largest after Lido in terms of EigenLayer deposits, with $431 million and $206 million, respectively.\n\nA burgeoning related sector is called liquid restaking. Puffer Finance launched with much fanfare earlier this week, joining ether.fi, Kelp DAO, Renzo and Eigenpie. And that may all be just the beginning for a fast-growing sector in DeFi.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

Early investor Paradigm criticized Blast\u2019s decision to launch its bridge before the L2, and blocking withdrawals for three months, as setting \u201ca bad precedent.\u201d Blast co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre has rebutted these complaints, calling them \u201cmisunderstandings.\u201d\n\nRoquerre previously founded Blur, which quickly catapulted ahead of OpenSea to become the top NFT marketplace in early 2023 thanks to its trading incentives; Blur has given out more than $800 million worth of tokens to traders. Blast aims to build on that momentum with a similar airdrop model, in the hopes of rapidly becoming a prominent Ethereum L2.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's note This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "title": "Top 9 smart contract platforms to consider in 2024 - TechTarget",
        "content": "Smart contracts let users write executable code that encodes business logic and runs on a blockchain or other type of decentralized ledger. Depending on your goals, there are many ways to use smart contract platforms to push these powerful apps into production.\n\n\"Smart contract platforms are decentralized systems that enable self-executing contracts on a blockchain,\" said Sanjiv Maewall, CTO of blockchain and digital assets at Deloitte Consulting. These platforms support secure, transparent and tamper-proof execution of predefined conditions, according to Maewall, which makes them ideal for trustless applications such as finance, supply chain management and voting systems.\n\nThere are four main kinds of smart contract platforms: large blockchain platforms; smaller ones optimized for improving smart contract execution speed or cost; private smart contract frameworks; and specialized tools for crafting and managing smart contracts across trusted partners.\n\nThese tools were selected based on their prominence across the various smart contract platforms; conversations with industry experts; and, in the case of the public smart contract platforms, their market cap and trading volume.\n\nWhat are smart contract platforms, and how do they work? Before diving deeper into the different types of smart contract platforms, it's helpful to define what a smart contract is and what it does. Lata Varghese, digital assets and blockchain practice leader at Protiviti, said she likes to think of a smart contract as \"a digital form of a traditional contract where contractual agreements between counterparties are inscribed as a piece of code.\" A smart contract is a self-executing program that automates the actions required by an agreement when predetermined terms and conditions are met. It ensures trust between the involved parties without needing a central authority. A smart contract platform is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that lets users create and execute smart contracts. A blockchain is not in and of itself a smart contract platform. Developers must extend it with tools to store smart contract code in a secure and tamper-proof form. They also add tools that enable decentralized and autonomous execution of smart contract code correctly, securely, transparently and deterministically. It's also important for the state transition from smart contract code execution to be verified by consensus of the nodes in the blockchain network before recording the state change in the blockchain ledger. The blockchain-based cryptocurrency Bitcoin supported the first digital, permissionless and tamper-proof smart contract, but it was of limited scope. Varghese said the major breakthrough came when the developers of the Ethereum blockchain added support for programmable smart contracts. They also introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as the computation engine that manages the state of the blockchain and enables smart contract functionality. \"Ethereum continues to be the most popular platform for smart contracts due to its highly decentralized security as well as a large community support,\" Varghese said. One caution for enterprise users is that smart contracts are not legally binding. Within the Web3 community, the term is used differently than enterprises looking to automate contract processes in a traditional sense. In parallel, lawyers and governments are developing frameworks for what are called smart legal contracts, which might or might not use decentralized ledger technology. Automated procurement platforms, such as SAP Ariba and B2B marketplace platforms, can sometimes be used to automate contractual processes through ERP integrations. Contract lifecycle management platforms (CLMs), such as the DocuSign Agreement Cloud, are also exploring ways to integrate smart legal contracts into enterprise workflows.\n\nLayers and levels of smart contract platforms Several blockchain technology platforms have been used for executing smart contracts. They're usually characterized as Level 1 (L1) or Level 2 (L2) platforms. L1 platforms are blockchains on which smart contracts are executed directly on the main core platform. Prominent examples are Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and BNB Smart Chain. L2 platforms execute the smart contracts on a parallel space so they can run more efficiently and quickly; they then roll up changes to the core platform. Examples of L2 platforms include Ethereum ZK-Rollups, Ethereum Optimistic Rollups and Polygon. Many of the newer offerings support both L1 and L2 capabilities. \"There is continuous innovation occurring in these technology platforms to address blockchain scalability challenges and become the platform of choice to build Web 3.0 applications,\" Varghese said, referring to the future blockchain-based generation of the web, often called Web3. The newer blockchain platforms almost uniformly have support for smart contracts, she said, and many are EVM compatible. That means a decentralized application (DApp) that runs on Ethereum can also run on them. Other prominent platforms Varghese has explored include Avalanche, Tezos, Algorand, Polygon, Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron, Near and Cardano. In addition, some blockchain platforms, such as Avalanche, Cosmos and Polkadot, are being adapted for private, permissioned smart contract implementations. Several smart contract platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda and Hyperledger Besu have supported enterprise blockchain implementations for at least five years. Purchasers should investigate a platform's protections against these smart contract security risks.\n\nKey factors to consider in a smart contract platform When choosing a smart contract platform, Maewall suggested examining a platform's security features, track record, scalability potential, performance, cost and strength of the associated developer community. \"Each platform has its unique offerings and tradeoffs, so choose one that best aligns with your project's requirements,\" he said. These platform elements also come with compromises. For example, Ethereum has the strongest developer community, but it also has the highest cost per transaction -- called gas in the blockchain community -- Maewall said. Similarly, some platforms are Turing complete. They can simulate every function of a Turing machine, a mathematical model of computation, which means users can write more expressive applications. But this flexibility comes at the expense of security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.\n\nUnderstanding the different approaches In some ways, smart contract infrastructure is comparable to that of cloud computing, which has many nested and sometimes overlapping platforms. On one level are the large infrastructure platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The application software layer includes Salesforce, ServiceNow and other platforms. In addition, private clouds enable enterprises to deploy workloads running on Docker containers that can move across public and private cloud infrastructure. Similarly, in the smart contract arena, Ethereum is like AWS before Microsoft and Google came along. Several newer competitors, including Cardano, Solana and Tron, provide alternatives to Ethereum. Another tier of platforms that includes Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Tezos mimics private cloud infrastructure. Development management platforms, such as Kaleido and Casper Labs, are designed to make it easier for partners to create and manage their own smart contract infrastructure. Additionally, CLM platform vendors are extending their tooling to support smart legal contract development management capabilities that span decentralized ledger and CLM capabilities, such as DocuSign Smart Agreements. There are nuances in how the various platforms approach the problem of smart contract development and deployment. For example, apps might run on EVMs, low-level VMs, Docker containers or other infrastructure. It's also important to consider your reasons for building decentralized apps before choosing a smart contract platform. Differences in platform features and capabilities can determine what an app can do and what users can accomplish by using it. For example, platforms such as Ethereum and Solana make it easier to incentivize infrastructure creation with cryptocurrency tokens. However, private trading partners might be happy to build or rent their own infrastructure. They are more motivated to streamline transactions and improve transparency. Much like in the cloud industry, there are dozens of smart contract platforms, and the field is evolving rapidly. Rather than surveying all of them, it's more helpful to focus on the top categories and the biggest or most interesting players. With this in mind, let's look at some of the top smart contract platforms across key categories.\n\nTop tier Ethereum Ethereum pioneered flexible smart contracts when it was launched in 2013. It supports Solidity, a variant of the JavaScript programming language that was immediately accessible to front-end developers and quickly grew a massive base of developers and financial supporters. Ethereum also pioneered the EVM, which has become a standard for other smart contract platforms. Ethereum's stock market capitalization is far and wide above competitors. In early 2024, it was $277 billion -- several times more than all the other smart contract platforms combined. The main benefit of a large market cap is that successful smart contract apps have the potential to grow faster in a much larger virtual economy. Ethereum is the top choice for developers who want to game the largest smart contract ecosystem with a bright new idea. Some observers say Ethereum's performance is not as fast as some of the upstarts. Smart contract mistakes can be expensive and difficult to unwind; in some cases, this can require a fork, a usually temporary split in the Ethereum network to allow major technical upgrades or changes. The blockchain has also been undergoing a constant pace of forks, merges and upgrades. The Shanghai upgrade in mid-2023, called Shapella, supported a more efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and faster transaction processing.\n\nSecond generation The success of Ethereum smart contracts revealed some fundamental disadvantages of the platform. For one thing, it's not particularly fast compared to modern transaction processing infrastructure -- a few dozen transactions per second compared to 24,000 for the Visa payment network. Hackers also discovered new security bugs in Ethereum smart contracts that were difficult to resolve. For example, a hack of the first Ethereum distributed autonomous organization, a type of management structure built on a smart contract, resulted in the DAO losing a third of its value. Eventually, Ethereum was hard forked -- permanently split in two -- to undo some of the damage. A second generation of open blockchain networks has sprung up to address such shortcomings. BNB Smart Chain The BNB Smart Chain is built on the BNB coin. It was previously the Binance Coin by Binance and was migrated to a separate Smart Chain in 2019 to create a native coin. In early 2024, the BNB coin had a market cap of about $47 billion. The platform supports a proof-of-stake authority consensus mechanism architected to optimize speed and keep transaction costs low. The network currently supports a million daily users and more than 2,000 active DApps. It is also popular among the gaming community, with over 287,000 weekly active gamers. The platform supports several popular development languages, including Solidity, Go, Java and Swift. One potential concern for developers is that Binance, the company behind the chain, has suffered legal problems that could impact the rollout of smart contract apps in the U.S. In November 2023, Binance pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and agreed to pay over $4 billion in fines. Solana The Solana blockchain ecosystem has recently grown to be the third largest public smart contract platform with a market cap of about $44 billion as of early 2024. Some experts consider it more efficient than Ethereum and many other public blockchains. Factors contributing to the speed include support for a low-level virtual machine for deploying smart contracts as well as the use of C and Rust programming languages for writing them. That makes it a good bet for developers looking to combine high transaction rates with the economic opportunities available on a public blockchain. Cardano Cardano was introduced as a more energy-efficient alternative to Ethereum in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, who also helped start Ethereum. In 2021, it introduced its Plutus feature for building smart contracts. The community has also created several programming languages for creating smart contracts on Cardano, including Marlowe, Aiken, OpShin and plu-ts. Cardano is a newer platform with less functionality and fewer developers than others on this list. However, it has the fourth-largest market cap at about $19 billion, making it an interesting option for developers who want to take advantage of a large token economy outside of Ethereum.\n\nPrivate blockchains Private blockchains are similar to open source cloud development platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, OpenShift and Cloudify but for smart contracts. The code itself is open source; a variety of expert service firms provision it on private hardware in data centers or on top of cloud services. Private blockchains are a good fit for businesses and government organizations that want to streamline transactions between trusted partners. They're a good choice for improving the efficiency of things enterprises already do, with mechanisms to update contracts or roll back transactions when problems are discovered. The most common use of private blockchains is scaling trust across enterprise boundaries. Hyperledger Fabric IBM developed Hyperledger Fabric and then handed it off to the Linux Foundation to create an enterprise-grade blockchain platform with modular architecture and various consensus mechanisms. It enables fine-grained control of data visibility and confidentiality so only authorized people can access data. It also supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Go and Java, and is designed to handle high transaction volumes. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain network. That means only authorized individuals or devices can participate in transactions, which is important from a trust, compliance and regulatory perspective. Corda Corda was created to model and automate real-world transactions in a legally enforceable way. Private channels let participants transact directly to improve the confidentiality of transactions. Numerous integrations have been built for the finance, healthcare and supply chain industries."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ERC-404 is a new token standard that has taken the market by storm.\n\nThe new experimental standard combines the best of fungible and non-fungible tokens standards, ERC-20 and ERC-721, respectively.\n\nPandora, the first token that uses ERC-404, has skyrocketed 5.400% since its launch on February 2.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has remained lull despite the Ether ETF applications. But the launch of ERC-404 could be a key catalyst that kickstarts a rally for ETH.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price poised for gains as Dencun upgrade goes live on the testnet\n\nWhat is ERC-404?\n\nERC-404 is an experimental token standard built on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to combine the functionalities of ERC-20 tokens (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 tokens (non-fungible tokens, or NFTs) into a single standard. This means that ERC-404 tokens can be both fungible and non-fungible, depending on the specific implementation.\n\nIn a nutshell, ERC-404 is a new way of defining digital assets like tokens or collectibles on the internet.\n\nERC-404 key features breakdown:\n\nHybrid functionality: ERC-404 tokens can represent both fungible and non-fungible assets, offering flexibility for various use cases.\n\nNative liquidity: Unlike traditional NFTs, ERC-404 tokens have built-in liquidity mechanisms, allowing for easier trading and fractional ownership.\n\nProgrammable scarcity: The supply of ERC-404 tokens can be dynamically adjusted through code, enabling innovative tokenomics models.\n\nHow does ERC-404 work?\n\nOne NFT of the underlying project is awarded to the wallet that has a full ERC-404 token. When the token is sold, the NFT is automatically burned. Both the tokens and NFTs can be traded independently.\n\nIs ERC-404 safe?\n\nERC-404 is not vetted, hence an experimental standard. Its development has not followed the traditional route \u2013 Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIPs). Additionally, it has not undergone a full external audit, but it has been tested extensively.\n\nThe only similarity ERC-404 and other ERC standards like ERC-20 or ERC-721 share is the name \u201cERC,\u201d which stands for Ethereum Request for Comments.\n\nProjects using ERC-404 token standard\n\nPandora and DeFrogs are the only two projects that have implemented the ERC-404 token standard. The latter project\u2019s token, DEFROGS price, is up 21% in the last hour, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nCtrl, the team behind the launch of the experimental token standard, has also launched Pandora.

Morpho operates similarly, but it also matches users peer-to-peer when possible, offering better rates for both borrowers and lenders.\n\nAlthough Morpho tops the total borrow value chart, the protocol sits at the sixth spot for the top lending protocols by total value of crypto assets deposited.\n\nTotal investor deposits in Morpho ($)\n\nAave currently has over $7 billion total crypto assets, and Compound has over $2.2 billion, while Morpho still only has $1.6 billion.\n\nWhat makes Morpho different\n\nGenerally with lending protocols, lenders will deposit their assets into a lending market from which users can borrow from.\n\nAlthough that method is popular, one disadvantage is that all that money deposited in a lending market sits idly, meaning a majority of the capital in these pools is not actively lent out, therefore, it is not generating yields.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nMorpho is built on top of Aave and Compound so it can take advantage of the same rates and assets within either protocol. But, it also tries to match users peer-to-peer to reduce the amount of idle capital and provide more attractive borrowing rates.\n\nWhen a peer-to-peer match cannot be made, it simply routes to the underlying lending markets; Aave or Compound.\n\nThis creates a scenario for Morpho users where at worst they will receive the same rates they would as using a conventional lending market, or at best, they receive the improved peer-to-peer rate.\n\nThe rates for DAI, a popular stablecoin, on Compound are 5.75% for lenders while borrowers pay 8.34%. On the other hand, the rate for borrowers and lenders when matched peer-to-peer on Morpho is 6.61% which is better for both parties.\n\nAlthough it may not seem like a big increase, for investors with a lot of money often called whales, these percentages can mean a lot. If a user opened a $10 million loan for stablecoin DAI and held it for a year, they would save over $173,000 by using Morpho.\n\nUsers are also rewarded with MORPHO tokens, but these tokens are strictly used for governance as they cannot be traded.\n\nThese tokens may hold financial value in the future, as the Morpho documentation states that token holders may vote to enable trading at any point.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "content": "ERC404 tokens have exploded on Ethereum, led by Pandora's $230 million volume.\n\nThe top three ERC404 projects contributed 12% to Uniswap\u2019s 24 hour volume on Ethereum.\n\nThe frenzy has raised concerns about rug pulls and high gas fees.\n\nLess than a week since the creation of ERC404, trading volumes on Ethereum are now dominated by these hybrid tokens.\n\nThe top ERC404 collection, Pandora, has experienced over $230 million in total volume since launching on February 2.\n\nThe PANDORA/WETH liquidity pool on decentralised exchange Uniswap is now the number three pool by volume, only behind stalwarts USDC/ETH and USDC/USDT.\n\nThe top three ERC404 projects \u2014 Pandora, MNRCH and DeFrogs \u2014 have registered a combined $113 million worth of trades over the past 24 hours, accounting for 12% of Uniswap\u2019s Ethereum trading volume.\n\nERC404 is a token standard on Ethereum that combines characteristics of both cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It greatly improves the liquidity \u2014 availability of funds \u2014 for NFTs, which are typically highly-illiquid assets.\n\nWhen a user holds at least one token of an ERC404 project an NFT is automatically minted. The user can then either sell the token, thereby burning the NFT, or they can list the NFT on a marketplace like Opensea.\n\nBut the frenzied trading around ERC404 tokens comes with consequences.\n\nThere have already been a number of rug pulls \u2014 situations where the address that created a token pulls liquidity leaving investors with nothing \u2014 and rising gas costs on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe ERC404 frenzy\n\nAs traders flock to the ERC404 token standard, some have started to take advantage of the frenzy. On Wednesday, a token trading under the name Punks, rose from $350 to over $20,000 in just two hours. Now, it\u2019s almost worthless.\n\nThat\u2019s because the wallet that created the token used a malicious contract that allowed the creation of an infinite number of Punks tokens. Shortly after Punks hit $20,000, the wallet\u2019s controller executed the contract, minting thousands of tokens which were then sold into the PUNKS/WETH Uniswap pool.\n\nUsers who invested in this token lost everything while the creator\u2019s wallet walked away with a gain of 42 Ether \u2014 or about $100,000.\n\nSimilar incidents occurred with four other ERC404 collections using variations of the Punks name in the last two days.\n\nERC404\u2032s are also contributing to rising gas costs on Ethereum. Given the standard is so new, it has not yet been optimised for gas costs.\n\nEthereum gas fees spent trading the Pandora ERC404 token. (Chocolate Chungus)\n\nGas fees on Ethereum are payments made by users in order to send transactions. Ethereum is designed to increase the cost of transactions during busy periods to protect the network from spam attacks.\n\nThe founder of the Pandora collection recently stated in the project\u2019s Telegram chat that the next ERC404 improvement should reduce gas costs by 300 to 400%.\n\nThis will likely be welcomed by Ethereum mainnet users. Gas fees on the network have averaged 53 gwei over the past 24 hours, while the average for the previous seven days was 29 gwei.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "title": "Latest Ethereum price predictions: $5,000 by the end of 2024. - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we see the latest forecasts on the future price of Ethereum offered by the fintech company Finder, which conducted a survey with 40 experts in the cryptocurrency industry in January 2024.\n\nThe emerged results speak clearly: the majority of experts are super bullish on the price of ETH, with predictions for the next 6 years talking about figures higher than four zeros.\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum could experience a real rally as soon as it breaks the long-term downtrend, which has been ongoing since August 2022, in the chart against Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nFinder\u2019s predictions on the future price of Ethereum\n\nAccording to a panel conducted in January 2024 by the analysis company Finder, in which 40 fintech market specialists were interviewed, the price of Ethereum could soon skyrocket if it were to meet the announced forecasts.\n\nAccording to the average of the responses obtained from the participants, by the end of the year ETH could reach $5,000 per token, approaching $4,887, thus increasing its current value by over 100%.\n\nThere are even those who have gone so far as to imagine a fiery scenario for Ethereum, hypothesizing a price of $17,000 by the end of 2024. At the same time, there are also those who, going against the tide, support the crypto market bears and predict a price of $1,333.\n\nApproximately 23% of the interviewed speakers believe that the price of ETH will rise in the range of $4,000 to $4,999 at its maximum before the end of 2024, while another approximately 23% believe that we will see the price of ETH within the range of $3,000 to $3,999 in the same time frame.\n\nExpanding our horizons, we see that forecasts indicate a potential growth of the cryptocurrency that could reach $7,492 in 2025, while by 2030 we could reach $19,190.\n\nThese numbers, obtained as a simple average of the responses provided by industry experts, are significantly higher compared to those recorded in a similar survey conducted by Finder in October 2023.\n\nThe analysts interviewed by Finder also contributed to explaining the reasons for their bullish or bearish biases, providing technical support to the market forecasts provided.\n\nIn particular, we see how Damian Chmiel, senior analyst and editor of Finance Magnates, believes that the fate of Ethereum largely depends on the performance that Bitcoin will record:\n\n\u201cThe price of Ethereum will reflect what happens with Bitcoin. If I believe in a historical high by the end of 2024 around $70,000 for BTC, I also believe that ETH will reach its historical high, testing the $5,000 level.\u201d\n\nEven Jonathan Hababou Solomon, co-founder and co-CEO of ARIA Algorithmic Ratings & Investment Analysis, agrees with Chmiel\u2019s thesis. He notes a very strong correlation factor between the two assets, but emphasizes that the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could have the upper hand this year:\n\n\u201cGiven the strong correlation between bitcoin and ether, it is likely that ether will benefit from bitcoin catalysts such as spot ETFs [bitcoin] and [the halving]. However, I believe that ether has greater potential due to its current market price. There is a general perception that ether offers a better opportunity for higher multiple profits compared to bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to a slightly less optimistic forecast by Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler SA, the price of ETH is expected to increase in 2024 without breaking any previous highs.\n\nAccording to his vision, Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure will capture a lot of value in the coming years due to its advantageous technology, but at the same time, competitors will grow alongside it:\n\n\u201cIn the long term, the price of assets will increase because Ethereum is the main ecosystem for blockchain projects. However, competition with other blockchain ecosystems will intensify.\u201d\n\nTechnical analysis of ETH-USDT and ETH-BTC charts\n\nAt this point, to complete the overall picture of the future price predictions of Ethereum, let\u2019s take a look at the ETH-USDT and ETH-BTC charts to identify potential starting points for the next predicted increases in the asset\u2019s value.\n\nCurrently, the cryptocurrency is priced at $2417, well above the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, with the macro trend reversing after the declines of 2022 and becoming clearly bullish since January 2023.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum has had some difficulty in surpassing the $2500 mark, never managing to close candles above the fateful level.\n\nOn multiple occasions, Ether has attempted to break out against the dollar, but without managing to surpass the $2800 high.\n\nTo give more space to the optimism of the bulls, it will be necessary to break the $2500 mark as soon as possible, trying to break into the area around $3000 as well. The volumes have not yet returned to 2020 levels but are gradually growing.\n\nThe RSI indicator is at a medium-high level in the channel but leaves fertile ground for other potential bullish climbs.\n\nWeekly chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USDT)\n\nAs for the ETH-BTC chart, we notice that the situation is quite different.\n\nPrices are currently below the 50-period moving average on a weekly time frame, indicating a more bearish outlook.\n\nSince August 2022, the currency of the world\u2019s most famous smart contract platform has recorded a downward trend against the market king Bitcoin, losing about 40% from the highs to the lows of the last 2 years of trading.\n\nBy the end of 2023, Ethereum has consolidated within the range of 0.05-0.055, increasing the chances of a trend reversal and fueling positive predictions on the price of the crypto.\n\nIf the bottom has really been reached in recent months, then we can expect a year of strong rebounds both for ether and for many altcoins, which will benefit from the loss of power of BTC.\n\nCurrently, the most optimistic scenario involves a recovery of 0.07 by mid-2024, with the remaining 6 months of the year in which we could witness an attempt to remove one zero from the chart and bring ETH back to one-tenth of the value of BTC.\n\nThe most important resistance is located at 0.085 zone, which has acted as a peak in the chart for the past 5 years, preventing any return to the crazy levels reached during the bull run of 2017.\n\nWe are waiting to find out ETH\u2019s next move towards BTC, in order to update price forecasts and identify the most likely targets."

        "content": "The Ethereum crypto has witnessed a notable rally, with its price soaring towards $2400, buoyed by the excitement surrounding the imminent deployment of the Dencun upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s core developers recently implemented the Dencun upgrade on the Holesky testnet, marking the final phase before its expected mainnet rollout in early to mid-March.\n\nThe integration of EIP-4844, a key feature of Dencun, is anticipated to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s scalability and cost-effectiveness, particularly for Layer 2 rollup chains. Notably, the Ethereum price rally today also sparked curiosity, despite the SEC delaying the spot Ethereum ETF approval from Invesco and Galaxy Digital.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Live On Holesky Testnet\n\nDespite market consolidation, Ethereum has experienced a surge in price, fueled by optimism surrounding the upcoming Dencun upgrade. The successful implementation of Dencun on the Holesky testnet, as confirmed by Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh, signifies a crucial milestone before its anticipated mainnet deployment.\n\nThis upgrade, featuring EIP-4844, notably promises significant enhancements to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction cost reduction, positioning the network for further growth and adoption in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade underscores Ethereum\u2019s dedication to ongoing advancement and innovation. With a focus on scalability through proto-danksharding, improved security measures, and enhanced network efficiency, Dencun is poised to strengthen Ethereum\u2019s standing as a premier blockchain platform substantially.\n\nEthereum Price To $3,500?\n\nIn a recent analysis, prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe highlighted the imminent uptrend for Ethereum (ETH), particularly as a focus on the Dencun upgrade. Van de Poppe predicts that the Ethereum price surge is imminent, with a target set at $3,500.\n\nExpressing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential, van de Poppe emphasized that the market is currently undervaluing the significance of ETH. He further disclosed his strong preference for the Ethereum ecosystem, foreseeing it as a major driving force in the months ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart stated that he continues to expect more delays in spot Ethereum ETF approval in the coming months. According to Seyffart, the focal point for Ethereum spot ETFs currently revolves around May 23rd, which marks the final deadline set by VanEck, another ETF issuer seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nAccording to a study by Coingecko, Europe leads the global Ethereum (ETH) ETF market, holding an 81.4% share. The region boasts 13 ETH-backed ETFs, covering both spot products and futures funds, with assets under management (AUM) totaling $4.6 billion.\n\nCanada also plays a significant role in the ETH ETF market, holding a 16.6% share with $949 million in AUM. ETFs have emerged as a popular entry point into the crypto space for many Canadian investors.\n\nAs of February 2nd, the total global AUM for ETH ETFs reached $5.7 billion, spread across 27 ETFs offering both spot and futures funds\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a stunning display of trading acumen, an Ethereum (ETH) trader managed to secure a profit of approximately $166,000 within just two days, starting with an investment of merely 0.26 ETH (equivalent to $613). This remarkable feat was achieved through strategic transactions involving DeFrogs (DEFROGS), a new cryptocurrency that has recently captured the attention of the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to details shared by Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, the trader embarked on this lucrative journey by initially investing 0.08 ETH ($190) to purchase 100 DEFROGS tokens. This transaction was executed despite the high gas fees at the time, which amounted to 0.178 ETH ($423). The decision to bear such significant transaction costs early on underscores the trader's confidence in the potential of their investment.\n\nIn just 2 days, this trader made $166K with only 0.26 $ETH($613)!\n\n\n\nThis trader spent only 0.08 $ETH($190) to buy 100 #DEFROGS using a high gas of 0.178 $ETH($423), then sold 60 #DEFROGS for 27.8 $ETH ($67K).\n\n\n\nHe currently has 40 #DEFROGS($100K) left, the total profit is ~166K! pic.twitter.com/g0VtlKoKGM \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 8, 2024\n\nThe strategy began to bear fruit when the Ethereum trader sold 60 of their DEFROGS tokens for a staggering 27.8 ETH, translating to approximately $67,000. This sale not only recouped the initial investment and associated costs but also yielded a substantial profit. As of the latest update, the trader still holds 40 DEFROGS tokens, valued at around $100,000, bringing their total profit to the vicinity of $166,000.\n\nMeme coin craze\n\nThis trading success story coincides with a significant surge in the value of DeFrogs (DEFROGS). The cryptocurrency has experienced a remarkable 111.91% increase in its value over the last 24 hours, with its price currently standing at $3,335 per token. This surge has propelled the trading volume of DEFROGS to $28.8 million and boosted its market capitalization to $34.27 million, highlighting the growing interest and confidence in this new digital asset.\n\nDeFrogs is part of the burgeoning meme coin sector , drawing inspiration from the Pepe (PEPE) crypto project. Launched on Feb. 7, DEFROGS is touted as a token based on the novel ERC-404 standard. This standard is designed to blend the features of cryptocurrencies with those of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offering a unique value proposition in the digital asset space.\n\nThe story of this Ethereum trader's success serves as a testament to the potential rewards of strategic and informed trading within the volatile cryptocurrency market. It also underscores the importance of staying abreast of emerging trends and technologies in the digital asset space, where innovative projects like DeFrogs can offer significant opportunities for growth and profit."

        "content": "Ark Invest and 21Shares amended their joint application for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in a Feb. 7 S-1 filing.\n\nAccording to one section, financial firms that are allowed to purchase and redeem ETF shares will only have access to cash creations and redemptions. They will not have access to in-kind creations and redemptions involving ETH.\n\nThe relevant section reads:\n\n\u201cAuthorized Participants will deliver only cash to create shares and will receive only cash when redeeming Shares. Further, Authorized Participants will not directly or indirectly purchase, hold, deliver, or receive ether as part of the creation or redemption process or otherwise direct the Trust or an Ether Counterparty [in that respect].\u201d\n\nCash creations and redemptions were key to recent approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and as such, the same should be expected for spot Ethereum ETFs. Though it is unclear why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ultimately insisted on cash-based methods, some reports suggest that it is difficult for participants to handle crypto under current U.S. regulations.\n\nUpdate also puts forward ETH staking\n\nThe latest filing also suggests that the ETF issuers intend to engage in Ethereum staking. The filing states that 21Shares US LLC, the sponsor, \u201cgenerally expects to stake ether tokens from the Trust\u2019s Cold Vault Balance.\u201d\n\nThe filing additionally notes that although staking may generate rewards, which are to be treated as income, staking also comes with a risk of loss.\n\nStaking is not guaranteed in the final proposal. Scott Johnsson, GP at Van Buren Capital, noted that this section is bracketed and uncertain. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that the SEC will ultimately not allow staking.\n\nAmendment may be good news for ETH ETFs\n\nArk and 21Shares\u2019 amendment is a relatively positive development for spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC recently extended deadlines for several other ETH ETFs, including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy. By contrast, today\u2019s amendment suggests some degree of progress.\n\nHowever, none of those developments change the fact that the SEC must decide on a spot Ethereum ETF by May 23. The agency must approve or reject VanEck\u2019s proposal on that date and will likely decide on other similar funds simultaneously.\n\nExpectations around the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF are mixed. One Polymarket prediction market reports 43% odds of a May approval. Seyffart believes there is a 60% chance of approval, while one JP Morgan member believes there is a 50% chance. Standard Chartered Bank expects an approval in May, while TD Cowen does not expect an approval in 2024.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the latest news has affected investor sentiment, Ethereum (ETH) has gained slightly more than the 24-hour market average. ETH is up 1.9%, the crypto market is up 1.5% and Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1.3%.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 8:45 pm UTC on Feb. 7, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 2.07% over the past 24 hours.

This drop signifies a potential pivot point for the asset, with the next critical support level now in the spotlight, highlighted by the stark blue line on the trading chart.\n\nThe loss of the $0.000009 support level is implying a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. Traders often view such breaches as a signal for a potential downward trend, leading to increased selling pressure. The market seems to be in a precarious position, where the demand at the subsequent support level must hold to prevent further declines.\n\nFor SHIB, the next critical support level is now set around $0.0000087, highlighted by the blue line. This level represents a psychological and technical threshold, which, if breached, could intensify bearish momentum. The resistance level to watch is currently at $0.0000095, a boundary that SHIB needs to surpass to negate the current bearish outlook and potentially signal a reversal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a bullish scenario, if SHIB can consolidate above the current support and break through the resistance at $0.0000095, it could lead to a relief rally, attracting buyers back into the market. This could be driven by positive news, market sentiment or broader crypto market recovery. In this case, a move toward the next resistance at $0.000010 could be in the cards, potentially rekindling investor interest and speculative trading.\n\nEthereum gains confidence\n\nEthereum has seen a resurgence of momentum, possibly catalyzed by the recent outage on the Solana network. Investors are increasingly favoring stability, and Ethereum's uninterrupted service during Solana's downtime may have reinforced its position as the go-to platform for developers and investors seeking reliability.\n\nThe Ethereum network has maintained its operations without significant issues, which stands in stark contrast to the outage experienced by Solana, often touted as an Ethereum competitor. This reliability has not gone unnoticed. Amid fears of potential future outages, Solana's instability has inadvertently highlighted Ethereum's robustness, possibly triggering a shift in investor preference toward Ethereum.\n\nA look at the Ethereum price chart suggests a bullish trend, with the asset recently rebounding off the 50-day EMA, currently at around $2,331. The next resistance level to watch is around the $2,367 mark, which, if surpassed, could pave the way for further gains.\n\nThere has been speculation in the past that individuals with significant market influence, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, have contributed to network instabilities to benefit their trading platforms. While these rumors have been persistent, the recent Solana incident appears to be the result of a genuine surge in activity, rather than any malevolent interference.\n\nAs Ethereum continues its climb, support levels have solidified, particularly around the $2,206 line, aligning with the 100-day EMA. This level is crucial for Ethereum to maintain its current momentum and avoid a retracement toward lower supports.\n\nXRP's issues with volatility\n\nXRP is now facing a period of stagnant volatility and waning interest. With the ongoing SEC case showing no signs of progress and market participants shifting their focus elsewhere, XRP's trading volume and network activity have significantly dwindled.\n\nA glance at the XRP price chart reveals a constrained trading range, with the cryptocurrency struggling to make decisive moves. Currently languishing around the $0.50 mark, XRP finds itself trapped between the immediate support level at $0.49 and a faint resistance near $0.56. This tight range indicates a lack of enthusiasm from traders, with minimal volume to suggest any forthcoming change in this dynamic.\n\nThe decreasing volatility is symptomatic of broader market sentiment toward XRP. Without substantial developments in its legal challenges or breakthrough use cases that rekindle interest, XRP remains in a state of limbo. The once vibrant and highly speculative asset now sees days of minimal price change."
