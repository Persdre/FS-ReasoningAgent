        "title": "SEC Approves Spot ETH ETP's - JD Supra",
        "content": "On March 23, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) formally announced its approval of eight \u201cEther-Based Exchange Traded Products\u201d (the \u201cETPs\u201d).1 This announcement comes a little over four months after the SEC approved Bitcoin ETPs. The eight approved ETPs include (1) the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, (2) the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, (3) the iShares Ethereum Trust, (4) the VanEck Ethereum Trust, (5) the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, (6) the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, (7) the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and (8) the Franklin Ethereum ETF.2\n\nEther (\u201cETH\u201d) is the native token of the Ethereum Network, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin.3 Approval of the ETH ETPs is another step towards mainstream recognition and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The adoption of ETH may be more significant than that of Bitcoin as the Ethereum Network provides users the ability to build and scale protocols on its network with a vast number of potential use cases, whereas Bitcoin is mainly used as a store of value. Increased exposure to ETH will inevitably lead to greater exposure for Ethereum products. As of May 24, 2024, the Bitcoin ETPs saw over $272.28 billion in overall trading volume.4 It remains to be seen whether the ETH ETPs can replicate such volume, though it is likely that they will not, at least not at first. Asset allocators and institutions took many years to get comfortable with Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition (scarcity, immutability, sound money, etc.), not to mention the many years of ETF applications and rejections. The simple fact is that such institutions and managers are not as familiar with Ethereum now as they were with Bitcoin in January. In the long run, however, Ethereum\u2019s turning complete features make it a much more powerful form of \u201cprogramable money\u201d and it would not be surprising if institutional and retail investors ultimately see as much, or more, value in the asset.\n\nOn the other hand, some may argue that these ETPs are inconsistent with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. A similar concern was raised when Lido was responsible for almost one-third of the staking taking place on the Ethereum Network.5 Decentralization helps ensure that the Ethereum Network is not controlled by a few users. Conversely, the ETPs require these large asset managers to accumulate huge quantities of ETH. For now, these asset managers cannot stake their ETH or participate in the governance of the Ethereum Network, however, if given such opportunities, these asset managers could theoretically threaten the decentralized nature of the Ethereum Network and/or place the entire network under the control of the US government.\n\nAs these ETPs are brand new, we will have to wait to see how their adoption impacts cryptocurrencies and traditional finance."

        "content": "SEC's approval of S-1 forms crucial for Ethereum ETFs' public trading.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe initial date for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) trading in the US is still July 2nd, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In an X post, Balchunas doubled down on this date, highlighting that \u201ca bunch of amended S-1 Forms\u201d for those ETFs might be filed today.\n\n\u201cThen ball\u2019s in SEC\u2019s court to let issuers know about any final changes and effectiveness (aka final approval),\u201d added the analyst. On June 14th, he predicted the launch date for the first time, as reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nOn May 23rd, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ETF filings for eight Ethereum ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, and others. However, only the 19b-4 forms were approved, which acts as permission for the exchange-traded product to be created.\n\nNotably, the S-1 form, which is an initial registration required by the SEC before a security can be publicly traded, still needs approval. The first amended S-1 form came a few minutes after Balchunas\u2019 post, with Fidelity presenting the document with the adjustments ordered by the SEC.\n\nThe asset managers are not including their ETF fees on the S-1 forms, and the Bloomberg analyst assessed that they might be waiting for BlackRock to disclose \u201cto see what they need to orbit around.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Balchunas\u2019 fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart also expects all the remaining S-1 forms waiting to be amended to be filled today."

        "title": "Ethereum wins a major battle, but its war with the SEC is far from over - Fortune",
        "content": "Consensys, the maker of the popular MetaMask crypto wallet, announced this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission has backed off its unpopular campaign to investigate developers who use Ethereum. The move is in line with the growing legal consensus that Ethereum is a commodity, not a security, which puts it outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. The announcement, however, also contained a dark lining that reveals SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s crusade against Ethereum is far from over.\n\nYou may recall that things between Consensys and the SEC came to a head when the company took the bold step of suing in April, asking a federal judge to force the agency to back off. The lawsuit came as a preemptive strike after the SEC had telegraphed it was on the verge of filing charges against the company after a year-long campaign of issuing subpoenas to developers who use Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s legal position became tenuous after the agency, under growing political pressure, approved Ethereum ETFs\u2014an acknowledgement the currency is indeed a commodity. In response to an enquiry from Consensys, the SEC then informed the company it was \u201cclosing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\u201d The \u201c2.0\u201d phrase appears to be a reference to the blockchain\u2019s new proof-of-stake system that went into effect in 2022.\n\nAll of this came as good news to the market, and the price of Ethereum jumped around 3%. But one line in Consensys\u2019s announcement hinted that all was not quite as well as it seemed\u2014namely that its lawsuit with the SEC was ongoing. This seemed strange given that, if Ethereum is not a security, the SEC has no jurisdiction and there is nothing to hash out in court.\n\nI asked Consensys\u2019s lawyers what is going on and they told me the SEC is still going after MetaMask because it can be used to swap tokens on the DeFi market, and also because it offers access to staking\u2014a key element of Ethereum that pays users to help secure the network. Here is how the lawyers put it:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s theory is that, because the Swaps offering allows users to trade various tokens using DeFi platforms, it is a securities broker due to at least some of those tokens being securities. They also assert that providing a user interface to two liquid staking protocols is also brokerage activity, and that it also constitutes offering unregistered crypto asset securities. The closing of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation doesn\u2019t resolve those issues.\u201d\n\nThe SEC, in other words, is trying to argue that Consensys\u2014and by extension other firms\u2014is an unlicensed brokerage engaged in the securities trade. This is likely a losing argument too, but it\u2019s on brand for Gensler, who has treated the process of crypto regulation like a personal vendetta, to dig in to the bitter end. The upshot for the crypto industry is it has won another battle, but the war goes on.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating Jump\u2019s crypto trading activities.

        "title": "What You Need to Know about Ethereum ETFs - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "What You Need to Know about Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe buzz around Ethereum ETFs is reaching a fever pitch. Let's break down when you can expect them to hit the market and who's behind the scenes making it happen.\n\nEthereum ETF Launch \u2013 When\u2019s the Big Day?\n\nInvestors and traders are clutching their Ethereum wallets in anticipation of the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF guru, Eric Balchunas, has circled July 2nd on the calendar. This date could be a game-changer, opening up a fresh route for folks to dive into Ethereum.\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s in the Game?\n\nThe road to getting these ETFs approved has been a wild ride. The SEC has given the green light to the 19b-4 forms for eight big players, including heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. This stamp of approval is a big deal, letting these companies move forward with their ETF plans.\n\nThe SEC has also tossed some light comments on the S-1 filings back to the issuers. This is a good sign that things are moving in the right direction. SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinted during a budget chat on June 13th that we might see these ETFs get the nod by September. Back on May 23rd, the SEC gave a thumbs-up to the 19b-4 filings from eight companies for Ethereum ETFs. This is a solid signal that these ETFs are just around the corner. Investors and traders are watching like hawks, knowing that the launch of Ethereum ETFs could shake up the crypto market in a big way.\n\nMarket Projections\n\nGetting a grip on the market projections for the Ethereum ETF can be a game-changer for crypto traders and investors. Let\u2019s break down VanEck\u2019s price forecast and the expected institutional money flow.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Price Projection\n\nVanEck, a big player in asset management, has thrown out a bold prediction for Ethereum (ETH). They reckon Ethereum could hit $22,000 by 2030. This guess is based on Ethereum pulling in around $66 billion in \u201cfree cashflows.\u201d\n\nInstitutional Capital Inflows\n\nThe launch of spot Ethereum ETFs is set to draw in a hefty amount of institutional cash. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered thinks the inflows could be anywhere from $15 billion to $45 billion in the first year alone.\n\nThese numbers show just how much Ethereum ETFs could shake up the market. If you\u2019re into crypto trading or investing, this is something you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nImpact on ETH Prices\n\nPrice Rally Prediction\n\nEveryone\u2019s buzzing about the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, and it\u2019s got the crypto world in a tizzy. QCP Capital, a trading firm out of Singapore, thinks this could send ETH prices soaring. They\u2019re talking a 60% jump, similar to what happened when spot Bitcoin ETFs got the green light back in January.\n\nMarket Reaction and Price Fluctuations\n\nThe market\u2019s been all over the place since the news dropped on June 13th. ETH took a nosedive from $3,558 to $3,464, hitting its lowest point for the month. But it didn\u2019t stay down for long, bouncing back up by 0.69% to $3,517.\n\nEven with these ups and downs, the market isn\u2019t exactly screaming \u201cbullish.\u201d It looks like ETH might still be stuck in a bit of a rut, influenced by some bearish vibes. Check out the recent price movements.\n\nFor traders and investors, keeping tabs on these shifts is key. Knowing how the market\u2019s reacting can help you make smarter moves with your investments.\n\nApproval Process Updates\n\nSEC Chair\u2019s Statements\n\nDuring a budget hearing on June 13th, SEC Chair Gary Gensler mentioned that the approval process for Ethereum ETFs is expected to wrap up by summer, with a likely nod by September. The timeline hinges on how quickly issuers respond to the SEC\u2019s feedback. This has stirred up quite the buzz in the crypto world.\n\nPrice Impact and Market Sentiment\n\nEven with worries about the drawn-out approval process for Ethereum ETFs, Gensler\u2019s recent comments hint at a September green light, giving issuers more prep time. After the June 13th announcement about the potential approval, ETH\u2019s price saw some ups and downs.\n\nETH\u2019s price dipped from $3,558 to $3,464, hitting its lowest in June. But as of the latest update, ETH has bounced back a bit, up 0.69% to $3,517. Despite these price swings, the indicators didn\u2019t show a strong bullish vibe, suggesting ETH might still be swayed by bearish trends. This mixed market sentiment highlights the cautious optimism about the potential Ethereum ETF approval."

Each colored band shows the percentage of Ethereum in existence that was last moved within the time period denoted in the legend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s HODL Waves chart illustrates the distribution of held Ethereum over various time periods, indicating shifting trends in holding behavior among investors. The chart shows a noticeable concentration of Ethereum held for one to three years, signaling a significant amount of Ethereum acquired during the 2021-2022 period is still being held. The 1-2 year and 2-3 year bands reflect these holdings, comprising a substantial portion of the overall supply.\n\nThis holding pattern suggests confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value, with a significant portion of investors opting to retain their holdings rather than sell in response to market fluctuations. The decline in the proportion of Ethereum held for less than six months further supports this trend.\n\nIn contrast, the proportion of Ethereum held for more than seven years has grown, representing long-term holders who have witnessed multiple market cycles. This stability among long-term holders illustrates a persistent belief in Ethereum\u2019s foundational value and potential for future growth.\n\nOverall, the HODL Waves chart provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s market trends, revealing an investor base that is increasingly committed to long-term holding strategies amidst evolving market conditions."

        "content": "The head of digital assets research at VanEck, Matthew Sigel, is outlining how Ethereum (ETH) could reach a price of $154,000, which the asset manager set as the bull case target in a report released weeks ago.\n\nIn a new interview on Bankless, Sigel says that Ethereum could reach a six-figure price by increasing its market share.\n\n\u201cIn that case, ETH would be capturing 90% of all smart contract value intermediation\u2026 so the penetration rates get pretty chunky, so Ethereum essentially accounts for 15% of the total financial markets. And then 50% of the advertising market hosted on open-source blockchains. And between 20% to 25% of information technology (IT) infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI) going through open source blockchain.\u201d\n\nAccording to VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, the state of the global macro economy would also influence Ethereum\u2019s prospects of reaching a six-figure price.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019d say in that world probably emerging markets are doing very well and the US dollar is doing extremely poorly. And the US regulatory state has either like fully embraced open-source digital assets, which I think is unlikely, or you completely seeded them to other countries. And then in that bull case, Ethereum is capturing a pretty sizable percentage of the value.\u201d\n\nIn the report released earlier this month, VanEck set a base case target for Ethereum of $22,000, a potential gain of 518% from the current level.

However, it is still moving below key support levels like the 50 EMA and is currently consolidating at the 100 EMA. The most decisive factor for a recovery would be momentum that is not present at this exact moment.\n\nIt is critical that Bitcoin maintains above $65,000 for the near future. Strong support has been seen at this level, which might serve as the basis for a reversal. If Bitcoin is able to overcome the immediate resistance at the 50 EMA or roughly $67,000, traders are hopeful of a possible rebound.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI which is centered on 47, shows that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, pointing to a period of consolidation prior to any notable movement. The macroeconomic environment as a whole is one factor influencing Bitcoin's current performance. Investor sentiment in a variety of markets, including cryptocurrency, has been influenced by worries about inflation and possible interest rate increases by central banks.\n\nBitcoin's long-term prospects are still promising despite these obstacles because of its growing institutional adoption and ability to act as an inflation hedge. Given its continued institutional interest and widespread adoption, Bitcoin's long-term prospects appear bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana's questionable position\n\nWhile Solana clearly gained some respectable strength back in May, the situation for the asset has changed, and it has been going down steadily for the past 20 days. The SOLETH chart, often used for gauging market volatility, is clearly exhausted and might provide us with some growth in the future.\n\nThe Solana vs. Ethereum chart, which contrasts the two most powerful altcoins available, is an important comparison. This comparison makes the relative strength and possible volatility of the altcoin market easier for traders and investors to understand.\n\nA positive outlook for altcoins overall is frequently indicated by Solana's strong performance versus Ethereum and vice versa. Because SOLETH captures the growth and performance dynamics of two significant cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin, it is regarded as a barometer for market volatility. In the domains of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), Solana and Ethereum are renowned for their strong ecosystems and noteworthy use cases.\n\nSignificant movements in these two assets may point to more general trends on the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum frequently serves as a benchmark since it is the bigger and more well known of the two. Conversely, Solana stands for more recent quickly expanding blockchain initiatives. It is possible to infer market sentiment regarding innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency space from the interaction of these two assets on the SOL/ETH chart.\n\nCardano's unexpected bounce\n\nCardano somewhat bounced from a local support level at approximately $0.35, with the potential to fight with the 26 EMA for momentum in the next few days. This bounce is a small but crucial step toward breaking an aggravating downtrend that has plagued the cryptocurrency for months.\n\nHolding above $0.35 is critical for Cardano in the near term. This level has provided a lot of support and might provide the groundwork for a future upswing. Cardano may indicate the start of a recovery phase if it can muster enough momentum to test and possibly break above the 26 EMA.\n\nAn RSI of about 37 indicates that ADA is in oversold territory, which may draw in buyers searching for cheap points of entry. But Cardano has not exactly performed well over the long haul. Even with the community's strong support and the project's lofty objectives, ADA has had difficulty holding onto its value. Cardano has experienced a protracted decline and has not been able to return to its prior highs since hitting its all-time high in early 2022.\n\nNumerous reasons contribute to this subpar performance, including the general mood of competition from rival blockchain platforms and slower-than-anticipated development progress. Although anticipated by many investors, the Cardano ecosystem has not yet produced the ground-breaking applications.\n\nAlthough the deployment of smart contracts on the Cardano network was a big step forward, neither the number of dApps nor user adoption has increased significantly as a result of it. Some investors have become frustrated with ADA's slow development, which has made them doubt the company's long-term prospects."

Discover SCENE\n\nGrayscale, the world's biggest digital asset manager, is currently grappling with the limitations of its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) in the era of Ethereum staking.\n\nGrayscale recently updated its ETHE disclosures, adding: \"The current inability of the Trust to use its Ether in Staking and receive such rewards could place the Shares at a comparative disadvantage relative to an investment in Ether directly or through a vehicle that is not subject to such a prohibition, which could negatively affect the value of the Shares.\"\n\nThis addition comes on the heels of Ethereum's successful Shanghai upgrade in April, which enabled stakers to withdraw their locked ETH and rewards\u2014thus making staking a more attractive proposition for many investors. With annual staking yields ranging from 4-6%, ETHE investors are missing out on potential returns.\n\nIf the Grayscale Ethereum fund were ever to allow staking, the firm noted, it would first need to amend its Trust agreement with the SEC. And NYSE Arca\u2014the exchange where ETHE shares trade\u2014would need to apply for an SEC rule change. The firm wrote that it \"may seek\" approval to do so in the future, but made it very clear that it can't stake any of the Ethereum backing the fund's shares now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrayscale's frustration is understandable, especially given its ongoing efforts to convert ETHE into an ETF.\n\nIn a March SEC filing, the firm argued for the benefits of being able to \"stake the Ethereum held by the Trust\" as part of its push for an ETH spot ETF. However, the SEC has repeatedly denied Grayscale's ETF applications, leading to a legal battle between the firm and the regulator.\n\nGrayscale is not alone in navigating these regulatory challenges. Other prominent ETF applicants, such as Fidelity and Ark Invest/21 Shares, have recently removed staking language from their filings in what appears to be a temporary concession to the SEC's concerns.\n\nUnder Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has taken a cautious approach to Ethereum staking, arguing that staking services may constitute securities offerings. The regulator has emphasized the need for clear disclosures on how staked crypto is handled by companies, including whether funds are commingled.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the SEC seems open to approving spot Ethereum ETFs, the staking issue remains a point of contention. Some experts have warned of \"serious security risks\" associated with Ethereum ETFs, noting that large, centralized holdings could make the network more susceptible to attacks or manipulation.\n\nFor Grayscale, the staking limitation is one of several challenges facing its Ethereum Trust.\n\nETHE has consistently traded at a discount compared to its underlying ETH value, a gap that has widened to nearly 50% in recent months. Converting to an ETF structure could potentially help close this discount by enabling share creation and redemption.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, June 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market is energetic and ever-evolving, with certain tokens standing out due to their special advancements and promising prospects. As we move through 2024, Ethereum, Solana, and Furrever Token rise as the must-watch cryptos, each advertising unmistakable focal points and openings for financial specialists.\n\nEthereum and Solana: Balanced for a Major Upward Move?\n\nLater market examination by Jason Pizzino demonstrates that the cryptocurrency market is right now in a stealth zone, characterized by expanded fear and diminished market intrigued. This period regularly leads to littler extended bars after beginning alarms, with key levels just like the 50% mark holding relentless and lows remaining marginally higher. These patterns suggest the market may well be equipping up for a critical upward move within the coming months.\n\nEthereum's Resilience In the midst of Market Declines\n\nEthereum (ETH) has appeared relative quality by keeping up its position over the significant 50% level of its extent, set up amid the May low.

In case Ethereum breaks down to around $3,400, Pizzino proposes that $3,200 might be a secure level to observe.

Previous corrections in Solana extended from 37% to 52%, recommending that a redress down to 50% would be steady with past designs.\n\nSolana's capacity to remain over these key levels despite market instability highlights its potential for a major upward move.

        "content": "Multiple Spot Ethereum ETF applicants have filed updated S-1 documents with the SEC for approval of their ETF products Friday. As the last step before launch, The SEC requested that issuers file new ones to speed up the process of reviewing the ETF products.\n\nJUST IN: The following applicants filed an updated version of their S-1 spot Ethereum ETF application:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Bitwise\n\n\u2022 Fidelity\n\n\u2022 VanEck\n\n\u2022 Franklin\n\n\u2022 21Shares\n\n\u2022 Grayscale\n\n\u2022 BlackRock \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 21, 2024\n\nBlackRock; Grayscale; VanEck amongst others submitted their S-1s today. The SEC must now review the forms and let issuers know of any final changes needing to be made before ultimate approval. These forms are necessary to offer new securities publicly. This process may take more time for the SEC to process for each filer, especially if the regulator still holds any dissatisfaction for Ethereum ETFs. However, the prediction for a July 2nd launch still looks possible.\n\nFor context, Ethereum-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are a type of investment fund that holds Ethereum like stocks, commodities, or cryptocurrency. The ETFs trade on stock exchanges similar to stocks. The first round of Spot Ethereum ETF approvals came at the end of May 2024.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs To Come This July?\n\nSource: Altcoin Buzz\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Hit $4K After SEC Decision?\n\nThroughout this year, ETFs have dominated the digital asset sector. The industry\u2019s landmark approval arrived in January, with Spot Bitcoin ETFs launching. The impact was near-immediate, as BTC would reach an all-time high just three months after its debut. The launch of Ethereum ETFs is expected to do the same for Ether upon launch. Already at press time, Ethereum is up 50% since the start of the year. Despite a bearish past month, July and August will be interesting in dictating the future of the asset\u2019s price.\n\nThe hype around Ethereum ETFs is even spreading in Europe. UK-based multinational bank Standard Chartered is officially launching a Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desk. Bloomberg reports that the $820 billion bank\u2019s STAN will be used for buying and selling both BTC and ETH directly"

        "content": "In a significant turn of events, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, opting not to pursue any enforcement actions.\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, opting not to pursue any enforcement actions. This development has been hailed as a major victory for Ethereum developers and the broader cryptocurrency community.\n\nThis decision follows the SEC\u2019s recent approval of Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a letter sent earlier this month, ConsenSys, a leading blockchain technology company, argued that the approval of these ETFs implied Ethereum should not be classified as a security. The company behind the MetaMask Ethereum wallet had urged the SEC to close the investigation based on this premise. The SEC\u2019s decision to stand down has led to a significant impact on Ether (ETH). Its price saw a surge, breaking $3,500 in the minutes after the announcement, showing renewed market confidence.\n\nThis closure of the investigation marks the end of a contentious chapter in Ethereum\u2019s history. The SEC had previously considered ETH a commodity but changed its position, leading to regulatory uncertainty and a lawsuit from ConsenSys. The lawsuit, filed in April 2024, aimed to halt the SEC\u2019s investigation, arguing that Ethereum is a commodity and should not be under SEC jurisdiction.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not represent those of City AM, its affiliates, or employees.\n\nConsensys views the SEC\u2019s latest decision as the beginning of a new era. In a recent blog post, the company declared: \u201cToday\u2019s development marks the beginning of a new path forward.\u201d This outcome is a testament to Consensys\u2019 persistent efforts, including legal battles, to protect the Ethereum ecosystem. However, despite this victory, Consensys has stated it will continue its lawsuit against the SEC, alleging regulatory overreach.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s regulatory approach has been a point of discussion within the cryptocurrency community. While the Ethereum investigation has ended, other regulatory threats persist. For instance, the SEC has issued a Wells notice to Uniswap, indicating potential enforcement action. Similarly, Coinbase faces ongoing legal battles, and the XRP community continues to criticize the SEC for its perceived bias following Ethereum\u2019s favorable treatment.\n\nThe crypto industry remains at odds with regulatory bodies, seeking clearer rules and fair treatment. The SEC\u2019s recent decision is a positive step, but the journey toward regulatory harmony is far from over. As the landscape evolves, both crypto developers and regulators will need to work together to put in place a balanced framework that fosters innovation while ensuring compliance.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not represent those of City AM, its affiliates, or employees."

        "content": "Coinbase Lists Pre-Launch Ethereum Restaking Protocol at $12.2 Billion Valuation\n\nIn a recent development, Coinbase has listed the Ethereum (ETH) restaking protocol project, EigenLayer (EIGEN), for pre-launch trading. Coinbase\u2019s announcement on X confirmed that EIGEN is now open for trading ahead of its official launch on Coinbase\u2019s International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. This is specifically for users in eligible jurisdictions outside of the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nThe exchange explained, \u201cYou can now trade EIGEN-PERP with up to 2x leverage. EIGEN opens with a price of $7.307 and an Implied FDV of $12.2 B.\u201d EigenLayer enables ETH holders to re-stake their tokens for use as \u201ccryptoeconomic security\u201d for protocols other than Ethereum, in return for protocol fees and rewards. An example: if you staked $100 of ETH for 10 years at a rate of 5%, you would have $127. However, if you restaked the original ETH just one time for a total of $100 staked across 2 protocols for 10 years at a rate of 5%, you would have $154.\n\nThe pre-launch trading feature on Coinbase is a novel addition. It permits users to trade perpetual futures contracts on tokens that are yet to be launched. Once the underlying token is launched on relevant spot exchanges, the instrument transitions to a standard perpetual contract. Its accepted collateral/margins were listed as USDC, BTC, and ETH with a minimum order size of 10 USDC.\n\nHowever, Coinbase has also issued a warning to users about the increased risks associated with trading pre-launch digital assets. The exchange emphasized the need for users to fully understand the risks involved before trading contracts.\n\nThe listing of EigenLayer\u2019s restaking protocol on Coinbase for pre-launch trading marks a significant step in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market. This move not only provides traders with an opportunity to engage in futures contracts on tokens that are yet to be launched, but it also reflects the growing acceptance and integration of Ethereum-based protocols in the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of pre-launch trading on Coinbase could potentially pave the way for other exchanges to follow suit, thereby expanding the range of trading options available to cryptocurrency investors. However, it\u2019s crucial for traders to heed Coinbase\u2019s warning and fully understand the risks associated with pre-launch trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Coinbase Lists Pre-Launch Ethereum Restaking Protocol at $12.2 Billion Valuation originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum has fallen to $3,480, a 3% slip in the past 24 hours. Traders at Wintermute told Decrypt that ETH appears to be range-bound between $3,200 and $3,400 as derivatives traders are likely profiting from an Iron Condor strategy. The firm added that Bitcoin has been similarly range-bound between $63,000 and $65,000.\n\n\"Market consensus is these areas take importance as 'lines-in-the sand',\" an analysts from the firm's trading desk told Decrypt, \"and I'm seeing traders lean on them to define risk.\"\n\nAn Iron Condor is a direction-neutral options strategy where traders benefit from the underlying asset staying range-bound until the expiration of options.\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively low-risk strategy that\u2019s suitable for traders who expect low volatility in the Ethereum price. But because it involves buying and selling four different options contracts with the same expiration date, it requires precise timing to pull off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Wintermute analysts highlighted that the price range is an important area for derivatives traders, and a major swing in either direction could have a drastic impact on the price of ETH.\n\nEthereum\u2019s open interest dropped to $11.5 billion this week, which indicates that traders believe major price swings in the asset are unlikely. That's for the short-term. But there are signs that traders expect upward movement in the coming months.\n\nThe analysts noted that yesterday, a large trader bought Ethereum options with a $4,000 strike price while paying a $12,054,100 premium. The expiration date for these option contracts is September 27. The trader could potentially profit to the tune of approximately $107 million if ETH witnesses an upswing, especially if it crosses the $4,000 mark.\n\nThe expiration date of these contracts is important, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has stated that U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs will go live sometime this summer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOption contracts expiring between June 28 and July 5 have witnessed an increase of 6-8% in their implied volatility (IV). High IV indicates that buying options contracts is more expensive and poses a greater risk for the buyer. Additionally, these contracts are likely being bought in anticipation of commentary from the SEC regarding U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum has seen some major positive developments over the course of the week.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Bitwise has released a TV commercial for Ethereum ahead of spot ETFs. The firm minted the video as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEarlier this week, leading Ethereum developer Consensys announced that the SEC had closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 without filing any charges.\n\nThere are also signs that even without a start date for Ethereum ETFs to begin trading, institutional demand is starting to gain steam.\n\nPantera Capital Management LP is planning to invest $100 million in the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the issuer noted in an SEC filing. A report based on data from research firm K33 indicates that Ethereum ETFs could potentially attract $4 billion in inflows within five months of their launch.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Airdrop season continues as Blast\u2019s token generation event is set to occur on June 26, about a week after interoperability protocol LayerZero and rival blockchain network ZKsync opened up claims to their airdrop\n\nAhead of next week\u2019s airdrop, Blast has a total value locked of about $2 billion, more than Base\u2019s $1.6 billion.\n\nBlast, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain network, recorded all-time highs in daily transactions and active users on Thursday, ahead of its airdrop scheduled for June 26.\n\nAccording to data from blockchain analytics firm Artemis, the number of wallet addresses active on Blast, a rough proxy for active users, more than doubled from roughly 73,500 addresses at the start of June to about 168,400 as of June 20.\n\nThe increase in active addresses coincided with an uptick in daily transactions as well. Users generated 640,1000 transactions on the first day of June. Since then, the number of transactions has grown almost 72% to 1.1 million transactions, per Artemis\u2019 most recent data.\n\nRead More: What Is Blast on Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nThe all-time highs in daily transactions and users come as those in the Blast ecosystem are gearing up for the protocol\u2019s airdrop, set to occur in less than one week. \u201cDapps must distribute all Gold and Points to users by June 25, 8 a.m. ET in order for it to be counted,\u201d wrote the Blast team on X two days ago.\n\nHalf of the Blast airdrop is allocated to points, which are earned by users based on the balance of their wallets, while the remaining 50% has been earmarked for \u201cGold,\u201d which is for decentralized applications building natively on Blast. According to Blast\u2019s protocol documents, \u201cGold is meant to be used as incentives for Dapp growth. This means that Dapps should give 100% of any Gold they earn to their users.\u201d\n\nBlast\u2019s record levels prior to its airdrop also comes in the same week interoperability protocol LayerZero and rival layer 2 blockchain network ZKsync opened up their airdrop claims, aiming to reward their contributing users.\n\nSybils\n\nThe increased network activity in addresses and transactions for the months-old layer 2 blockchain network is a sign of Blast\u2019s popularity among users. But it is also safe to assume that a number of these addresses and transactions stem from Sybil techniques, in which one person acts as many users by employing more than a single wallet.\n\nThe goal of a Sybil attack is to simulate the kind of activity rewarded in an airdrop, distorting the on-chain picture of user activity so the attackers can, in this case, claim a larger share of the airdrop. Attempting to identify and disqualify addresses engaged in Sybil activities has become a common practice during a protocol\u2019s preparation in conducting its token generation event.\n\nLow-scale Sybil activities would mean a relative handful of Blast addresses were duplicates, while professional Sybil farmers may use thousands of wallet addresses to generate transactional activity on the network."

        "content": "The CEO of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, is updating his outlook on altcoins ahead of a potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nYoung Ju tells his 348,500 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum\u2019s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric is flashing a bullish signal.\n\nThe MVRV indicator, which is used to assess whether a particular crypto asset is undervalued or overvalued, is the ratio of market capitalization of Ethereum, or any other crypto asset, relative to its realized capitalization (the value of all ETH at the price they were bought at).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering early altcoin season.\n\nETH MVRV is rising faster than Bitcoin (BTC) MVRV, suggesting ETH market is heating up relative to its on-chain fundamentals.\n\nGiven the current ETF situation, this might be an ETH-only season. Historically, when ETH surges, other altcoins tend to follow.\u201d\n\nTurning to altcoins, the CryptoQuant CEO says that memecoin dominance is on the wane after reaching a 15-month high in March. Memecoin dominance is the proportion of the total market capitalization of memecoins relative to the total market capitalization of altcoins.\n\n\u201cCrypto Twitter would be shifting from gambling to focusing on fundamentals, similar to a few years ago.\n\nPack it up lads, it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The new offering will expand the bank\u2019s suite of digital asset services, including crypto custody and OTC trading.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s FX trading division will handle spot trades for the two leading crypto assets. The new desk, based in London, is expected to launch operations soon, as reported.\n\nWhile banks like Goldman Sachs Group have offered crypto derivatives, direct dealing in the assets has been limited due to stringent regulations. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s proposed rules have made profitability challenging by requiring a high-risk weighting for crypto exposure.\n\nStandard Chartered is working with regulators to address concerns and meet the demand from their institutional clients who want to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, in line with our strategy to support clients across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,\u201d a representative from Standard Chartered stated.\n\nThe launch will make Standard Chartered among the first major banks to establish a spot crypto trading desk, paving the way for wider institutional adoption."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe second wave of the crypto ETF marketing blitz has officially begun, with crypto index fund manager Bitwise releasing a \u201cnational TV ad\u201d on Thursday talking up the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4pm,\u201d the company wrote in a tweet on Thursday with an accompanying video.\n\nUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 40-second commercial featured an old man role-playing as the traditional stock market that\u2019s only \u201cawake\u201d from 9:30am to 4pm, contrasted with a young man representing Ethereum\u2014a blockchain that never goes offline.\n\n\u201cStablecoins, NFTs, loans... people can access me 24/7,\u201d the young man tells his elder. \u201cYou\u2019ll get after it again on Monday.\u201d\n\nFollowing the post, Bitwise revealed that it had minted the video as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Half of the ad\u2019s proceeds will go directly to the commercial\u2019s two actors.\n\nThe simple, short pitch mirrors that of the array of Bitcoin ETF commercials that hit the airwaves late last year. Promoters like Galaxy Digital said Bitcoin \u201cembodies empowerment in the digital age,\u201d while HashDex pitched it as the next \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d in financial technology after the credit card.\n\nBitwise was also the first of many issuers to run a Bitcoin ETF ad at the time, recruiting help from Johnathan Goldsmith\u2014the most interesting man in the world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat influx of ads preceded the Bitcoin spot ETF rollout that occurred roughly a month later, attracting billions of dollars in investments. As of today, expert analysts believe Ethereum ETFs are weeks away from going live, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas forecasting a simultaneous launch on July 2.\n\nGrayscale ran a TV commercial about Ethereum in March in support of its existing $10 billion Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which it intends to convert into an Ethereum ETF. However, Bitwise's ad is the first to go out for a proper Ethereum ETF after regulators officially approved them for public trading in late May.\n\nWhile no other Ethereum ads have emerged yet, future ETF providers have been talking up the asset\u2019s investment thesis. Much like Bitwise, VanEck in early June pitched Ethereum as a new and improved set of global financial rails, forecasting that ETH would hit $22,000 by 2030.\n\nLikewise, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan posted a thread on Thursday arguing why investors may want to diversify into Ethereum alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cAdding ETH to a portfolio over a full crypto market cycle has historically boosted both your absolute and risk-adjusted returns compared to adding BTC only,\u201d said Hougan.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire? Cathie Wood's Ether ETF Pullback And Her $20 Trillion Market Cap Prediction - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire? Cathie Wood's Ether ETF Pullback And Her $20 Trillion Market Cap Prediction\n\nEarlier in the year, Bitcoin dominated financial headlines thanks to its recent halving and the emergence of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) boosting its demand. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest made a bullish prediction that Ethereum (ETH) may soon catch up to Bitcoin and potentially offer investors significant returns in the years ahead.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nDogecoin millionaires are increasing \u2013 investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\n\nSpeaking at Big Ideas, an investor conference hosted by Ark Invest, Wood shared her optimistic outlook on Ethereum. She projected that Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization could soar to $20 trillion by 2032. Given Ethereum\u2019s current supply of approximately 122 million tokens, this projection translates to a staggering per-token price of over $166,000. Moreover, since the Ethereum Foundation continues implementing token burns, this price could rise even further.\n\nAt the hypothetical price of $164,000 per token, holding six ETH would equate to a value of just under $1 million. In comparison, the current price for six ETHs is roughly $21,000. To put this into perspective, the total market capitalization of the S&P 500 is approximately $40 trillion, while the global value of above-ground gold reserves is estimated at around $16 trillion. While reaching a $20 trillion market cap is theoretically possible for Ethereum, such a milestone is likely far off, if it happens at all.\n\nWood\u2019s optimistic forecast is primarily grounded in Ethereum\u2019s potential for mainstream adoption. Today, Ethereum is mainly used to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which offer services ranging from borrowing and lending to storing health records.\n\nHowever, in 2024, DeFi remains predominantly focused on small-scale financial platforms. Wood argues that if Ethereum can expand its use cases to provide substantial user benefits, broader adoption could follow, potentially driving up the token\u2019s price.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nWood\u2019s projection, while ambitious, may partly be intended to generate excitement among investors about Ethereum\u2019s future. Despite the optimism, her forecast might not materialize as predicted. It\u2019s crucial to note that Wood has a vested interest in Ethereum\u2019s success. Ark Invest, her firm, already offers an Ethereum futures ETF (ARKZ).\n\nHowever, it was reported by Bloomberg that Ark Investment withdrew from issuing an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Previously, Ark had submitted an application for a spot in Ether ETF in partnership with 21Shares, but Ark\u2019s name has now been removed from the filing. Despite this withdrawal, Ark\u2019s official statement emphasized the company\u2019s continued belief in Ethereum's transformative potential and long-term value. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that the decision might have been influenced by the ongoing \"fees war\" in the market, which complicates profitability for issuers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough many believed that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs would bring a boost to ETH prices, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a surprising move to approve the sale of spot Ether ETFs last month, ETH continued to slump, nearly dipping under $3,000 per token earlier this month. We've seen an incredible bounce back earlier this week, peaking at nearly $4,000 before hovering at $3,500 again.\n\nAn increase in Ethereum\u2019s trading volume would benefit Wood, particularly in relation to Ark Invest\u2019s financial products. Despite this potential conflict of interest, many investors remain optimistic about ETH\u2019s future. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow and the possibility of spot Ethereum ETFs looms, there is considerable potential for ETH to achieve new price milestones.\n\nThis story was previously published on Benzinga and has been updated.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Could Holding 6 (ETH) Still Make You a Millionaire?

        "content": "Stuart Alderoty, Ripple's top legal mind, still has some questions left after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly dropped its investigation into Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Alderoty described the SEC's decision as a \"big win\" for Ethereum studio Consensys, he is still not sure whether it means that the company's offers and sales of the Ether token are not securities. Moreover, the legal status of Ether itself largely remains in a grey area.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to clarify whether or not the Ether token can be considered to be an unregistered security. Alderoty is now wondering what Gensler's response to such a question would be now that the agency has abruptly ended its probe into Consensys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, the Ethereum backer filed a lawsuit against the agency after a Wells notice of impending enforcement action. Consensys accused the SEC of recklessly hurting market participants and developers by attempting to label Ether as a security. The studio also defended its popular MetaMask wallet, denying the SEC's claims that it had violated securities laws by acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.\n\nIn a sudden reversal, the SEC ended up not recommending an enforcement action, sending the price of the Ether token higher earlier this week.\n\nHowever, the status of Metamask and staking remains unclear, according to Alderoty."

This projection is based on recent observations within the ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency space. Renowned analyst and cofounder of Syncracy Capital, Ryan Watkins, asserts that the current setup for Ethereum DeFi is the strongest it has been since 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeFi\u2019s strong revenue growth and low valuations\n\nThe optimism lies in several factors such as the volume of revenue, upgrades in technology and the pending spot Ethereum exchange-traded-funds, ETFs, awaiting the final nod by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nPer Watkins' analysis, DeFi leaders are seeing record-high revenues, while their valuations are at historic lows. This combination of high revenue and low valuation presents a compelling opportunity to investors.\n\nThe setup for Ethereum DeFi is the strongest its been since 2020.\n\n\n\nDeFi leaders are generating all-time high revenues across the board, yet valuations are the cheapest they've been in history.\n\n\n\nBetter yet, these revenues will likely accelerate from here as DeFi leaders rollout\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WmaajQIpxI \u2014 Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) June 20, 2024\n\nSome of the leading DeFi applications on the Ethereum network, such as Lido, MakerDAAO, Uniswap and Aave have recorded progressive increases in revenues, surpassing their 2022 peaks. Aave's annualized revenue for 2022 was just over $500 million. However, in May 2024, it reached an all-time high of $750 million.\n\nFurthermore, this revenue is expected to grow even more as DeFi leaders implement major upgrades, such as Maker's Endgame and Uniswap V4.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of the Ethereum ETF is anticipated to spark renewed interest in the Ethereum economy. Despite facing a challenging regulatory environment since \"DeFi summer,\" the sector is gradually seeing improvements. Although there are no major policy changes expected in the near term, the overall narrative is becoming more favorable.\n\nMarket momentum and future prospects\n\nWatkins insists that as long as the long-term bullish trend continues, DeFi should benefit from positive momentum, given its highly cyclical nature. Market experts are optimistic that more and more users will be attracted by the DeFi offerings, further fueling growth.\n\nAlthough Uniswap is yet to generate any revenue, Watkins maintains that the potential for activating the fee switch seems imminent."

        "content": "The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin explains several decentralized applications (DApp) that demonstrate principles of privacy and decentralization in the cryptocurrency market, indicating a continued focus on improvement and the core principles of Ethereum even as meme coins gain more attention.\n\nButerin described Farcaster as a social network that relies on the Optimism protocol. Farcaster still enjoys relatively low usage, but the platform still offers relatively high decentralization for users. Buterin spoke about the Lens Protocol, a decentralized application where users own their content, which speaks volumes about Ethereum\u2019s vision of bringing decentralized interaction online.\n\nWe're still here! And a lot of that idealistic open internet stuff has actually moved forward quite a bit, eg. we have farcaster and lens, quadratic and retroactive funding, zupass, privacy-preserving ways to send ETH, ZK voting implementations\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 19, 2024\n\nButerin highlighted the importance of quadratic funding for the Gitcoin Grants as a fairly fresh concept of community funding for projects. This means they can fund different projects depending on what the community wants, thus, funding moves in the direction of accomplishing collective will.\n\nHe also mentioned that post-launch funding encourages schemes that have already proved useful and effective in practice, thus helping developers engage in more meaningful, effective project development.\n\nPrivacy improvements are also important according to Buterin in future Ethereum development. Buterin mentioned using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and zero-knowledge voting as critical innovations that allow verification of transactions and votes that occur in a black-box fashion while preserving privacy in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhile meme coins have surged in popularity, often overshadowing more substantial, utility-driven projects, Buterin acknowledges this trend but contrasts it with the significant developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized social networks."

        "content": "Gavin Wood co-founded Ethereum and wrote its first implementation, pioneering smart contracts.\n\nWood founded Polkadot, enhancing blockchain interoperability, and later transitioned to Chief Architect for innovative focus.\n\nGavin Wood\u2019s journey into the world of blockchain began using LEGO bricks rather than a computer. Self-described as a \u201ctechnologist at heart,\u201d Wood\u2019s early interest with creating intricate constructions gradually moved from actual blocks to digital ones. This love of innovation and problem-solving made his later activities in the blockchain sector possible.\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that Wood came into contact with. Thanks to the Silk Road online black market, his discovery was, in a sense, accidental.\n\nEnticed by the mathematical approach of human cooperation and interaction found in Bitcoin, Wood recognized the possibility of establishing whole new social systems. In little time at all, this interest became a professional possibility.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nWood had a meeting with Vitalik Buterin and other trailblazers engaged in the ambitious Ethereum project in 2014. Once Wood joined this team, he was instrumental in turning Ethereum from a white paper into a working blockchain.\n\nWith the creation of the initial Ethereum implementation, he introduced the world to smart contracts\u2014a ground-breaking idea that made decentralized, programmable transactions possible.\n\nWood wanted to create a platform that might propel social change as much as a new coin. Ethereum seemed to him like a means of creating a new planet that would propel human development for the remainder of the century.\n\nHis Ethereum work established the foundation for a significant force in the blockchain space that would upend established financial and economic institutions.\n\nMoving Beyond Ethereum: The Creation of Polkadot\n\nWood made major contributions to Ethereum and then focused on addressing some of the shortcomings he observed in the state of blockchain technology. As a result, Polkadot, a technology meant to facilitate smooth interoperability between several blockchains, was developed.\n\nThrough its special architecture, Polkadot addresses the scalability and governance problems that single-chain networks encounter by enabling several blockchains to run concurrently.\n\nood just presented a significant Polkadot update at the Token2049 conference: the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM). By enabling multi-core computing and improving network flexibility, this new protocol seeks to offer a more modular and minimalistic design.\n\nFrom Polkadot\u2019s current Relay Chain, the JAM protocol marks a dramatic change that will solve present constraints and advance the ecosystem toward its lofty objectives.\n\nWood resigned from Parity Technologies, the business that owns Polkadot, in October of 2022. He is still very much a part of Polkadot\u2019s technical and conceptual components as Chief Architect, even if he is no longer CEO. This change enables him to spend more time on the creative improvements and projects that still define his profession.\n\nThe Broader Impact of Gavin Wood\u2019s Work\n\nWood made more than just Ethereum and Polkadot contributions to the blockchain space. His concept to build decentralized platforms with blockchain technology has impacted a great deal of initiatives and businesses.\n\nThrough enabling interoperability between several blockchains, Polkadot has created new opportunities for both developers and companies, encouraging creativity and teamwork throughout the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a LEGO fanatic to a blockchain visionary, Gavin Wood\u2019s path demonstrates his unwavering quest of technical innovation. Beyond what blockchain technology can do, his work has encouraged a new generation of developers and entrepreneurs to go outside the box.\n\nThe tale of Wood is proof of the ability of creativity and vision to propel technological advancement. Key elements in his success have been his commitment to finding solutions to difficult challenges and his ability to predict the promise of blockchain technology.\n\nWood\u2019s story emphasizes for would-be entrepreneurs and engineers the value of remaining inquisitive, accepting obstacles, and never stopping to get better.\n\nThe future of distributed technology seems bright as long as Gavin Wood keeps leading and innovating in the blockchain field. His efforts with Polkadot and the JAM protocol are expected to completely change the way blockchains communicate, strengthening and expanding the ecosystem.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "title": "Comparing Avalanche and Ethereum: Which One Is Better? - Modern Diplomacy",
        "content": "Blockchain technology is developing quickly with several platforms springing up to meet the numerous demands and difficulties in the decentralized ecosystem. Among these, Ethereum and Avalanche stand out as two of the most prominent and innovative blockchain networks.\n\nDedicated platforms like Coindataflow.com offer a comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche price predictions. Developers, businesses, and investors can access complete information on prices, market capitalizations, charts, and statistics for both Avalanche and Ethereum. To find out which one is better, you should read the article below where we compare Avalanche and Ethereum.\n\nThe Basics of Ethereum\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is a distributed platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It introduced the concept of a programmable blockchain, allowing for the creation of a wide range of applications beyond just cryptocurrencies. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, following Bitcoin.\n\nKey Features of Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts : The platform\u2019s primary innovation is its ability to execute smart agreements, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.\n\n: The platform\u2019s primary innovation is its ability to execute smart agreements, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) : The EVM allows developers to run code on the Ethereum network, ensuring compatibility and security across all dApps.\n\n: The EVM allows developers to run code on the Ethereum network, ensuring compatibility and security across all dApps. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) : The platform is the backbone of the DeFi movement, hosting numerous financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries.\n\n: The platform is the backbone of the DeFi movement, hosting numerous financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Wide Adoption: With a large developer community and numerous projects built on its platform, Ethereum boasts extensive adoption and a robust ecosystem.\n\nAvalanche: The Essentials\n\nAvalanche, launched in 2020 by Ava Labs, is a high-performance blockchain platform that aims to deliver unprecedented scalability, speed, and security. It utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Avalanche consensus, which is a combination of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) protocols. Avalanche\u2019s native cryptocurrency, AVAX, has gained significant traction in the market.\n\nKey Features of Avalanche:\n\nHigh Throughput : Avalanche can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), significantly higher than Ethereum\u2019s current capacity.\n\n: Avalanche can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), significantly higher than Ethereum\u2019s current capacity. Low Latency : Transactions on Avalanche are confirmed in under a second, providing a seamless user experience.\n\n: Transactions on Avalanche are confirmed in under a second, providing a seamless user experience. Interoperability : Avalanche supports the creation of custom blockchains (subnets) that can interoperate with each other and other blockchain networks.\n\n: Avalanche supports the creation of custom blockchains (subnets) that can interoperate with each other and other blockchain networks. Eco-Friendly: Utilizing PoS, Avalanche is more energy-efficient compared to Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, which the latter plans to transition away from with Ethereum 2.0.\n\nComparison of the Crucial Aspects\n\nPerformance and Scalability\n\nWhen it comes to performance and scalability, Avalanche has a clear advantage over Ethereum. Avalanche\u2019s consensus mechanism allows it to achieve a higher TPS and lower latency, making it more suitable for applications requiring fast and efficient transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current PoW mechanism limits its scalability, leading to network congestion and high gas fees during peak times. However, ETH\u2019s upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, which will implement PoS, aims to address these issues and improve scalability.\n\nEcosystem and Adoption\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem is one of the largest in the blockchain space, with a vast number of dApps, DeFi protocols, and developer tools. The platform\u2019s first-mover advantage has resulted in widespread adoption and a strong network effect.\n\nIn contrast, Avalanche is relatively new but has quickly gained traction due to its superior performance and flexibility. However, the adoption of Avalanche is growing rapidly, with many projects choosing to build on its platform due to its technical advantages.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity is a critical aspect of any blockchain network. Ethereum has a long track record of being a secure platform, although it has faced some high-profile hacks and vulnerabilities in the past. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to enhance security further.\n\nAvalanche, with its novel consensus mechanism, also offers robust security features. Its PoS system reduces the risk of 51% attacks and ensures network stability.\n\nDevelopment and Flexibility\n\nBoth blockchain platforms offer flexible development environments. Ethereum\u2019s EVM is widely used and well-supported, making it easier for developers to create and deploy dApps.\n\nAvalanche, on the other hand, offers more flexibility with its subnet feature, allowing developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific use cases. This feature makes Avalanche an attractive option for enterprises and projects requiring specialized blockchain solutions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDetermining which blockchain platform is better between two notable blockchain platforms ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of the user. Ethereum boasts a mature ecosystem, extensive developer support, and a solid track record, making it a reliable choice for many projects. However, Avalanche\u2019s superior performance, scalability, and flexibility make it a compelling option, especially for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions to Ethereum 2.0, the competition between these two platforms is expected to intensify, bringing further innovations and improvements to the blockchain space. For developers, businesses, and investors, both Avalanche and Ethereum offer unique advantages that can be leveraged to build the next generation of decentralized applications and services.\n\nCarefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. Thus you can make an informed decision on which one best suits your needs in the constantly changing domain of blockchain technology."

        "title": "Choosing Polygon over Ethereum to Build Efficient dApps - Appinventiv",
        "content": "Polygon aims to give people numerous choices when they create dApp on Polygon. Some developers keep security over speed while others compromise on security for lowered fees and speed \u2013 the technology is building multiple Ethereum-centric scaling solutions to address all these different features.\n\nEthereum has remained a pillar in the cryptocurrency space. Right from DeFi to smart contracts and even NFTs, Ethereum has remained one of the key innovations of Web3. However, inspite of the glaring success, the technology has struggled with massive network congestion, high network fees, and lowering transaction throughput \u2013 factors that have created a scope for newer crypto projects coming in to scale it. Polygon is one such project.\n\nOriginated in 2017, India-based software company Polygon Technology scales Ethereum without sacrificing on its decentralization benefits. With the number of dApps on Polygon having reached 53,000, businesses are using the technology\u2019s low fees and fast speed to build Ethereum-powered dApps.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look into the different facets of Polygon and what makes the technology better than using Ethereum for dApps development.\n\nHow does the Polygon dApp builder work?\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables developers to build dApps on Ethereum without getting stuck with Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nHow it does that is by developing a layer 2 solution using off-chain on-chain concepts and different governance models like Proof of Stake, which helps the network lower its energy footprint by 99.95% \u2013 one which Etherum has also reached after The Merge. In addition to using a PoS architecture where the network participants stake MATIC for validating the transactions, Polygon enables developers to use its open source SDK to launch their Polygon dApp at the back of multiple scaling techniques:\n\nZK-Rollups: The ethereum-based technology acquired a zero-knowledge (ZK) protocol developer, Mir, for USD 400 million. What this protocol does is it enables transaction authenticators to validate the encrypted data without actually accessing the information enabling them to generate the verification proof in under 170 milliseconds.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: It consists of bundling several off-chain transactions into massive batches before submitting them in Ethereum. This way, the fixed costs get spread across multiple transactions that reduce the end-user fees. In essence, this scaling technique assumes off-chain transactions validity without pushing out validity proofs for the on-chain transaction batches by following a fraud-proving methodology to identify transactions having discrepancies.\n\nPlasma Chains: This scaling technique builds a child-parent relationship in Ethereum\u2019s main chain. For example, the plasma chains can deploy their own dApps on Polygon which comes in handy when the other sidechains get hacked or are down. Additionally, the plasma chains tend to deliver off-chain transactions at higher efficiency levels.\n\nAt the back of these scaling methods, while the answer to how much time does it take to build dApp on Polygon is same as that on Ethereum or other blockchain technology, the transaction speed and cost difference is unmatched.\n\nFeatures of Polygon for dApp development\n\nThe technology merges the capabilities of sovereign blockchains and Ethereum into an attractive feature set that helps developers build a decentralized app on Polygon that is highly efficient, scalable, and speedy.\n\nEthereum compatibility\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon you work on a platform with complete Ethereum compatibility to tech stack, languages, standards, and tools.\n\nHigh scalability\n\nThe technology is built on dedicated blockchains, a scalable consensus algorithm, and a customized Wasm execution environment.\n\nCompetitive network Greater security\n\nPolygon dApp development is built on a modular \u201csecurity as a service\u201d facility offered either by Ethereum or a pool or validators.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe technology comes with a native support for the arbitrary messaging passing bridges for external systems and can easily connect with Ethereum main chain using the bridging SDKs polygon offers.\n\nGood user experience\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon it is very similar to one on Web2 purely at the back of a facility like instantaneous transaction finality.\n\nModularity\n\nPolygon comes with high extensibility, customization, upgradability, community collaboration, and a short time-to-market.\n\nThese features of Polygon for dApp development are designed to bring the technology at par with the adoption of Ethereum minus all the limitations of the latter. This makes it profitable for developers and enterprises alike to build a decentralized app on Polygon.\n\nAmidst these feature sets and the obvious benefits of Polygon for dApp development, is it time to let go of Ethereum? And on a technological level, what difference does Ethereum hold from Polygon dApp development?\n\nCreating dApps on Polygon vs Ethereum\n\nWhile The Merge moved Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, bringing down its 112 TWh of energy consumption down to 0.01 TWh, the technology is where Polygon already is.\n\nThe Merge however, didn\u2019t change the high variable transaction cost that Ethereum comes with \u2013 a factor that Polygon addresses on a massive extent. In addition to this, the transaction processing speed has also remained unchanged, which in case of Polygon dApps development is only 65,000 transactions per second at the back of the Layer 2 scalability solution.\n\nLet us look into the differences to understand why it makes sense to build dApps on Polygon.\n\nFactors Ethereum Polygon Foundation 2013 2017 Scalability 10 TPS 7000 Market Cap 139.56 Billion 7.698 Billion Average transaction fees 0.4876 US$0.01 Programming language Solidity Solidity, Golang, Vyper Transaction Deterministic Finality Instant 5 minutes Total dApps 2970 53,000\n\nWhile Polygon\u2019s popularity is on a fast rise, there are some issues that are still prevalent in the technology. For understanding Polygon to its entirety, it is critical to know the limitations it comes attached with. Let us give a brief look at them:\n\nEthereum Dependency: Ethereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations.\n\nEthereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations. Under Development: Presently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions.

Matic Plasma Chains: Polygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma.\n\nPolygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma. Competition: There are a number of scaling solutions such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc. which are gaining steady momentum. They are making use of Ethereum and other blockchains to offer better user experience. Amidst this, we might see other solutions coming up and taking Polygon\u2019s market share.\n\nWith everything we have covered up until this point, one thing is clear \u2013 even though the technology has some limitations which need to be addressed, the benefits of Polygon for dApp development are unignorable. However, for an entrepreneur what is necessary is to know the use cases on which they can create dApp on Polygon.\n\nThe use cases to build dApp on Polygon\n\nThe biggest reason why dApp development service providers like Appinventiv choose Polygon is the fact that the end product is the same as what results from Ethereum app development but the customer experience is much greater. So while the businesses get the same Ethereum-powered app, their users get an innovative user experience, higher lowered transaction speed, and minimal transaction fees.\n\nPayments: Polygon platform is engineered to create dApps that speed up the payment process, powering almost real-time payment settlement via specialized API and SDK integration. This enables apps, users, and merchants to instantly perform transactions through multiple cryptocurrencies, usually through the ETH or ERC-20 tokens. This system is being rolled out in three distinct phases: 1. ERC-20 token payments 2. Token transfer in cross-chain 3. Fiat-based payment models.\n\nLending Platform: The next use case to consider when you build dApp on Polygon is creating a module that would enable lenders to analyze users credit ratings and building a smart contract that would automate the loan disbursement journey.\n\nGames: The Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution of Polygon makes blockchain-based gaming platform development efficient and fast. With Ethereum and Polygon working together, the platform will be able to address the lag issues that non-Polygon blockchain games face.\n\nOther Use Cases: There are a range of other use cases to consider when you build a decentralized app on Polygon such as enabling fast settlement times required for decentralized exchanges to provide faster and cheaper trading.\n\n[Also Read: How to monetize with your dApp?]\n\nAmidst these use cases, the Polygon ecosystem is fast expanding. Here\u2019s a look into some of the top applications that are a part of the network\n\nAdditionally, most of the dApps require a method to sign transactions without submitting in the users\u2019 private keys details. On the back of its scalability enhancements, the technology helps in enabling an open identity framework for the dApp, thus solving the privacy issue.\n\nThese use cases are only a surface-level explanation of why businesses should develop dApp on Polygon. There are a range of other applications that can be built on Polygon.\n\nUltimately, even though Polygon dApps are built upon Ethereum, there are some very critical differences between them, specifically in transaction speed and cost. Such costly gas fees and slow transactions can lead to poor user experience that would leave a negative impact on the platform\u2019s adoption. On this note, it makes better business sense to select Polygon, thanks to its ability to back faster transactions and lowered gas fees.\n\nAt Appinventiv, it is our constant endeavor to think about our clients\u2019 customers first and this is the reason why we make dApp on Polygon. Using the technology we have built a range of decentralized apps right from a crypto wallet app to a DeFi exchange all promising a positive customer experience.\n\nLooking to explore the technology for your next dApp project?

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is finally regaining some of its lost position. The second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market has already tested the $3,600 threshold. While the 26 EMA break did not happen, the fact that Ethereum tested that threshold may become a foundation for a bullish reversal in the foreseeable future.\n\nEthereum needs to rise above critical support levels in the near future. In particular, the $3,400 and $3,352 support levels are crucial. Ethereum could indicate strength and the possibility of further upward momentum if it can stay above these supports.\n\nTraders are keeping a careful eye on these levels for any indications of persistently bullish activity. The most likely reason behind the reversal is the exhaustion of bulls.\n\nInvestors should monitor the $3,600 resistance level, as a break above it may trigger a fresh upswing in price. Overall Ethereum's long-term potential \u2014 fueled by growing adoption thanks to the ETF and technological advancements \u2014 remains intact even though short-term fluctuations are to be expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's surprising strength\n\nXRP faces a 26 EMA resistance level after the bounce from $0.46, which is a strong signal for the asset. Despite losing the $0.5 support level, the short-term outlook is surprisingly positive for XRP. Key resistance levels to watch include $0.52 and $0.54, where a break above these could indicate further upward movement.\n\nA sustained price above $0.46 is critical for XRP in the near term. With its solid support, this level might serve as the basis for a resurgence. As long as XRP can overcome the immediate resistance at $0.52, traders are hopeful about a possible rebound.\n\nStill, there is cause for concern regarding the asset's long-term performance. The future of XRP is clouded by enduring regulatory challenges, most notably the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. Since bad news can cause prices to drop sharply, market sentiment is also an important consideration.\n\nThe outcome of these legal challenges and public perception of the cryptocurrency market will have a significant impact on XRP's long-term prospects. Even though the short-term outlook is promising and could result in gains if resistance levels are overcome, investors should exercise caution. XRP has a number of long-term issues that could affect how well it performs in the upcoming months.\n\nShiba Inu is plummeting\n\nShiba Inu's drop below $0.00002 was dramatic and clearly should be treated as a signal of a potentially upcoming price drop. However, there is an important factor to consider: the short-term price drop is not set in stone, so bulls may still have enough reserves to buy back.\n\nSpecifically, $0.000019, $0.000022 and $0.000023 are three important price levels to keep an eye on. Each of these levels represents potential resistance or support areas that could determine Shiba Inu's next move.\n\nAt these prices a significant buyback might stop the current downward trend but if it does not hold, losses could continue. Short-term maintenance above $0.000019 is critical. A breakdown below this level could result in additional selling pressure because it has served as a significant level of support. On the other hand, a recovery of $0.000022 and $0.000023 would suggest a return of bullish momentum and might draw additional buyers into the market.\n\nThe popularity of Shiba Inu is fueled by its active social media presence and thriving community frequently causing their prices to fluctuate sharply. Sentiment can shift quickly, which can have a major impact on price, so traders need to be prepared for that.\n\nFurthermore, Shiba Inu's performance may be impacted by changes in the larger cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu's long-term prospects hinge on its capacity to sustain interest and usage among the cryptocurrency community. Long-term growth may be possible for the project if it keeps coming up with new ideas and draws in users."

Additionally, he suggested that the SEC might still view ETH as a security.\n\nFurthermore, Alderoty questioned SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s potential response regarding ETH\u2019s regulatory status. Lastly, the Ripple CLO noted that the regulatory status of Metamask\u2019s staking and swap services could be in question due to the SEC\u2019s refusal to address the matter in its recent response.\n\nHe expressed frustration with the lack of clear regulatory guidance for the U.S. crypto industry, which could hinder innovation in the country.\n\nA big win for Consensys, though questions remain. Does this mean the SEC thinks Consensys\u2019 offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions and/or that ETH itself is not a security? What will Gensler say if now asked?

This is because U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres held that XRP in itself is not a security.\n\nFight Continues\n\nThough the SEC has ended investigations into Ethereum 2.0, Consensys is still embroiled in a lawsuit against the securities regulator. The Ethereum developer filed the suit in April, requesting a Texas court to declare the staking and swap services offered on Metamask as non-securities.\n\nSince the SEC did not comment on the status of Metamask\u2019s staking and swap services, Consensys stated that its legal fight with the regulator would continue."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered is creating a Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desk in London, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThis will make it one of the first global banks to enter spot crypto trading, in the wake of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs being approved in the U.S.. Standard Chartered\u2019s new crypto desk will begin trading soon, two people told the outlet, and will be part of the Forex trading unit.\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, in line with our strategy to support clients across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,\u201d Standard Chartered told Decrypt, echoing the statement it made to Bloomberg.\n\nBut Standard Chartered declined to respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bank part-owns institutional crypto custodian Zodia Custody and has backed institutional digital asset trading firm Zodia Markets. Now setting up its own spot crypto trading desk shows clear intention to move deeper into the world of digital assets, after dipping its toes through investment.\n\nOther banks have traded crypto before, but due to regulation they have had to trade in derivatives rather than the actual asset itself. For example, Goldman Sachs began trading Bitcoin futures in 2020, then opened its Bitcoin derivative trading desk in 2021.\n\nThe Basel Committee, an organization that sets global standards for banks, recommended in a 2022 report that banks should apply a 1,250% risk weighting when trading crypto assets. This term refers to the amount of capital a bank should have in reserve to counter the risk of the investment. Industry experts have noted that this incredibly high weighting makes it hard for banks to turn a profit on crypto trading.\n\nStandard Chartered has been bullish on crypto recently. In May, it predicted Bitcoin and Ethereum to hit all-time highs after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in the U.S.. Soon, the bank predicted that Solana and XRP ETFs would be next to be approved in the States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlbeit this is likely a 2025 story not a 2024 one,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of crypto research and emerging market foreign currencies, said.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Ethereum was trading at an average price of $3,527, at press time. Its 24 hour trading volume stood at around $19.5 billion, with a market cap of $433 billion.\n\nEthereum has surged by 6% since retesting a 50-day exponential moving average resistance level.

However, the bearish rally could continue."

        "content": "S&P Global Ratings recently published a report stating that the Ethereum restaking services offering an additional yield are gaining prominence and could lead to a solid \u201cinternet bond\u201d market in the long term.\n\nSimilar to the bond market, holders of Ethereum earn additional yield by either pledging or staking their ETH coins to help with transaction verification on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to lending out securities in fixed-income markets, ETH restaking reinvest the staking rewards and provide compounding returns to investors. Ethereum restaking platforms like EigenLayer have been much in the limelight recently. Amid this popularity, EigenLayer went live on the crypto exchange Coinbase recently.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Rise of Ethereum Restaking\n\nIn a report published on Wednesday, Andrew O\u2019Neill, S&P Global\u2019s digital assets analytical lead, highlighted the importance of restaking in order to enhance economic growth within the crypto market.\n\nO\u2019Neill also stated that restaking allows Ethereum node operators to validate new services by using established tokens thereby eliminating the need for these services to create their own validator with their own, illiquid, and volatile tokens.\n\nAs of now, there are only a few active restaking services popular as \u201cactively validated services\u201d. The report by S&P Global also notes that the total value of ETH restaked in the EigenLayer has surpassed 5.3 million Ether, valued at a staggering $19 million. Earlier this week, EigenLayer opened the Phase 2 claims for the EIGEN airdrop.\n\nRisks Associated with Restaking\n\nThe risks associated with restaking are primarily operational and specific to each actively validated service (AVS), though financial risks could emerge due to market speculation.\n\n\u201cWe do not currently foresee significant ecosystem-level financial risk as staking and restaking are generally non-custodial and there is no rehypothecation of the collateral,\u201d O\u2019Neill writes. \u201cThe impact of restaking on system-level leverage must be monitored, particularly through borrowing and leverage metrics on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols\u201d.\n\nEver since the EigenLayer launch in April, the protocol has gained strong traction within no time. This could inspire more players in the market to bring restaking services.\n\nHowever, the bigger question is whether the US SEc would allow more restaking protocols in the market. Another doubt is whether the SEC will allow restaking protocols to mature into \u201cinternet bond\u201d market without proper regulations.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price increased by nearly 3% in the last seven days.\n\nSelling pressure on ETH continued to remain high.\n\nWhile most cryptos\u2019 prices were declining, Ethereum [ETH] decoupled from the market as it went the other way. In fact, the king of altcoins was outshining Bitcoin [BTC] on a key front, which hinted at a bull rally in the coming days.\n\nEthereum beats Bitcoin\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH bulls stepped up their game over the last seven days as the token\u2019s price increased. The token\u2019s daily chart also remained green as it moved up marginally.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,575.26 with a market capitalization of over $437 billion.\n\nWhile that happened, Ki Young Ju, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet pointing out an interesting development.\n\nAs per the tweet, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio was rising, suggesting that ETH\u2019s market was heating up relative to its on-chain fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, ETH managed to outperform Bitcoin in terms of MVRV ratio growth rate. The tweet also mentioned that, given the current ETF situation, this might be an ETH-only season.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that historically, when ETH surges, other alts tend to follow.\n\nIs ETH ready for a bull rally?\n\nSince the aforementioned dataset suggested that the chances of ETH showcasing a bullish performance were high, AMBCrypto planned to check its on-chain metrics.\n\nAs per our analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven days\u2019 average, meaning that selling pressure was high.\n\nAdditionally, its Coinbase premium was red, indicating that selling sentiment was dominant among US investors. Nonetheless, the Korea premium looked optimistic as it indicated that Korean investors were willing to buy ETH.\n\nA few of the technical indicators also looked bullish on the king of altcoins. For instance, the MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and was resting at the neutral mark at press time.\n\nAdditionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also moved northward, hinting at a price increase in the coming days.\n\nAMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to look for possible targets for this week if ETH remains bullish.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nWe found that ETH might first touch $3,660, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level. A rise in liquidation often results in short-term price corrections.\n\nA successful breakout above that level might allow ETH to reach $3.8k. However, if the bears takeover, then investors might witness ETH drop to $3.28k this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It submitted its amended S-1 to the agency, but the fee charges haven\u2019t been included yet.\n\nReacting to the update, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted,\n\n\u2018I believe this filing from @BitwiseInvest is the first of the amended #Ethereum ETF S-1\u2019s. This will contain the changes from the SEC\u2019s first round of comments.\u2019\n\nThe analyst added that Pantera Capital, a crypto-focused VC firm, was planning to put $100 million into Bitwise\u2019s ETH ETF product (ETHW)\n\n\u2018Looks like Panterra will be putting up to $100 million into @BitwiseInvest\u2019s Ethereum ETF \u2014 $ETHW\u2019\n\nThe VC reportedly pumped $200 million into Bitwise\u2019s spot US BTC ETF product in January.\n\nOther issuers are expected to submit their amended S-1s in the coming days. However, Seyffart noted that the amends \u2018might not need additional but might require tweaks\u2019.\n\n4th July in focus for ETH ETF approvals\n\nAlong with his colleague, Eric Balchunas, the analysts maintained that the products could be approved and launched by 4th July.\n\nThe SEC chair, Garry Gensler, recently confirmed that the approvals could be likely by summer. Overall, most market observers expected an approval by early July.\n\nThat said, there have been divergent views on institutional demand for ETH ETF products. Some projected low demand since the products won\u2019t have a \u2018staking\u2019 feature.\n\nHowever, Ophelia Snyder, co-founder of digital asset manager 21Shares, maintained that the lack of staking will not affect institutional demand.\n\nIn fact, the executive added that staking could affect liquidity, especially when the lock-up period is extended.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH was up +4% in the past 24 hours and traded at $3.54K. Besides, ETH whales were on the move as they eyed the potential launch of the ETH ETF in early July."

Despite this traders were showing interest in the altcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity grows\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the popularity of ETH had soared significantly over the last few days.\n\nThe current discussions surrounding Ethereum ETFs, SEC investigations, regulatory developments, and Consensys\u2019 advocacy efforts for Ethereum\u2019s status are likely contributing to this increased attention.\n\nThere were both bearish and bullish perspectives that can be had around the popularity of the rising interest in Ethereum.\n\nSantiment\u2019s data suggested that the bearish concerns stemmed from the potential classification of Ethereum as a commodity by the SEC.\n\nDespite SEC dropping the investigation, the fact that it is willing to go after the coin can cause problems for the network. It could also pose a hurdle for the approval of other Ethereum ETFs, a key driver of current interest.\n\nAdditionally, the ongoing regulatory battle between Ripple and the SEC casted a shadow, as similar actions against ETH could dampen market sentiment.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status and its potential limitations act as headwinds for the project.\n\nFrom the bullish perspective, there were a lot of points in favor of Ethereum. For instance, the SEC dropping its investigation, effectively clearing ETH sales of being securities, has been a major boost.\n\nThis news has led to a surge in ETH-related altcoins and a more stable market environment.\n\nFurthermore, the development of cross-chain bridges connecting Ethereum to other blockchains showcased continued growth and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nState of staking\n\nIn terms of staking, it was observed that the staking participation rate increased significantly for ETH.

This follows insight from a renowned ETF analyst who projects the D-Day on July 2. In the meantime, ETH price holds firmly to support at $3,500. A breakout from this level could breach the $4,000 resistance which will ignite FOMO as investors back the uptrend toward $5,000.\n\nBitcoin too is starting to shape the next crypto landscape this week after reclaiming ground above $65,500. With the two largest cryptocurrencies modestly in the green, investors are beginning to appreciate the sell-off as a blessing in disguise. This means they can apply key dollar cost-averaging practices, buy the dips, and eventually increase potential gains in the second half of the year.\n\nFactors Likely To Drive The Next Altcoin Season\n\nThe crypto fear and greed index has fallen to 64\u2014still showing greed among investors but significantly below last week\u2019s figure of 74. This indicator by Alternative, monitors market sentiment with zero on the scale referring to extreme fear and 100 to extreme greed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSince markets function as living entities, sentiment is driven by people. As euphoria increases, investors become greedy due to the FOMO. This propels prices higher but also introduces the risk of a drastic decline as some investors decide to take profits. It is rarely a good idea to buy when the crypto fear and greed index is near the extreme top.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, a drop in the metrics suggests greed is creeping in. Because sentiment is falling, many people choose to sell\u2014some due to the fear of losing their capital or possibly to protect unrealized gains.\n\nIt is advisable to buy when the market is red and sell when it is green. With that in mind, investors might consider this to be a good time to buy into their favorite altcoins, ignoring the drop in the fear and greed index to 64.\n\nEthereum price has increased 1.3% in 24 hours to $3,585 on Thursday. The value growth, although minor, has reflected a 0.81% surge in the market cap to $438 billion. However, the second-largest digital asset faces a 30% slide in the trading volume to $14 billion\u2014a factor likely to hamper potential growth in the upcoming sessions.\n\nNevertheless, investors seem to have set their sight on the approvable of the spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs in May pending further approval for the operators of the products which will eventually give way to actual trading on stock exchanges.\n\nThe SEC also dropped investigations into Ethereum, further clearing doubts that Ether could be considered a security.\n\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted earlier this week that Ethereum ETFs could start trading on July 2. This followed word that the SEC \u201csent issuers comments on S-1s today, and they\u2019re pretty light, nothing major, asking for them back in a week.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: we are moving up our over/under date for the launch of spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, hearing the Staff sent issuers comments on S-1s today, and they're pretty light, nothing major, asking for them back in a week. Decent chance they work to declare them effective the next\u2026 https://t.co/XJZ8JLwEFF \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 14, 2024\n\nThe start of the actual trading of Ethereum ETFs could spark fresh interest in ETH and altcoins. Traditional investors would find it easier to buy ETH via exchanges, validating the crypto market.\n\nAnalysts at CoinGape expect this to be a moment of reckoning for altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin which are believed to be the next in line for spot ETFs.\n\nThe move could be bullish for the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin, and possibly usher in the much-anticipated altcoin season.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Stares At A 30% Breakout\n\nEthereum price is making key strides in its recovery following the correction to $3,400. The token currently sits above two exponential moving averages (EMAs), the 20-day and the 50-day.\n\nA daily close above $3,600 resistance would mean that bulls are getting back in the game for a breakout past $4,000. The presence of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern on the daily chart could reinforce the bullish grip when validated.\n\nThis is a bullish pattern validated when the price breaches the neckline resistance around $3,800 in Ethereum price prediction case. Traders would enter above this resistance eyeing a 30% move close to $5,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Blockchain startup Consensys has predicted that spot Ethereum ETF S-1 registrations will soon be approved.\n\nAnalysts are projecting a an early July approval timeline for trading to commence.\n\nBlockchain software technology company, Consensys has predicted that the SEC could approve S-1 filings for spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in a matter of days. Collin Brown, a renowned blockchain researcher commented that the prediction portends a bullish signal for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Ethereum ETF approval on the horizon! Consensys predicts SEC could give the green light within days. Bullish signal for $ETH! \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udcbc #Ethereum #ETF Are your bags filled? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/aF91qMIXsv \u2014 Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) June 21, 2024\n\nSentiments for Ethereum\u2019s ETF Approval\n\nJimmy Ragosa, product manager at Consensys believes the wait for spot Ethereum ETFs trading in the U.S. might be nearing its end. Ragosa\u2019s optimism stems from a recently amended S-1 document, submitted by Bitwise Asset Management to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 18.\n\nHe pointed out that compared to the previous version, Bitwise\u2019s update omits details on the fee structure and initial investment. He added that the bulk of the SEC\u2019s feedback centered around risk factors, legal and regulatory statements, contact information, and the distribution plan. Ragosa, therefore, projects an imminent approval from the SEC, based on the areas requiring revision.\n\nThis optimistic outlook aligns with recent comments from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. He confirmed that the SEC\u2019s feedback to prospective Ethereum ETF issuers earlier this month was \u201cpretty light,\u201d focusing on minor revisions.\n\nBalchunas even revised his initial prediction for the launch date, moving it up from July 4 to July 2 based on the expedited S-1 approval timeline. Last month, the SEC approved eight 19b-4 documents from exchanges requesting to list Ethereum ETFs, as previously reported by Crypto News Flash. With that hurdle cleared, the S-1 approval stands as the final regulatory step to Ethereum ETF trading in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, VanEck is another investment manager who believes approvals for spot Ethereum ETFs could happen in the coming weeks. As previously reported by Crypto News Flash, VanEck\u2019s Matthew Sigel says the firm is accumulating Ethereum in anticipation of the launch.\n\nSEC Concludes Ethereum Sales on Consensys\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum ETFs is the recent conclusion of the SEC\u2019s investigation into Consensys\u2019 ETH sales. The investigation, which focused on whether these sales constituted security offerings, cleared the way for Ethereum by not recommending any enforcement action.\n\nConsensys disclosed in an earlier report shared by Crypto News Flash that the victory follows a battle of regulatory challenges and a lawsuit filed by the firm. Notably, this development eliminates a potential hurdle for Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nDespite this victory, the SEC appears not to be giving up on its crypto enforcement actions. In response to Consensys victory, the SEC\u2019s correspondence gave a disclaimer that the closure of the investigation should not be interpreted as an exoneration.\n\nETH, the native digital asset of Ethereum appears to be reacting negatively to these developments. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,481, demonstrating a 3% decrease over 24 hours. However, the trading volume increased by 11% to $15.9 billion, demonstrating renewed interest from investors."

        "title": "3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO - TradingView",
        "content": "In a recent commentary shared on X, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which ranks as the world\u2019s largest provider of cryptocurrency index funds, detailed why investors should consider diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolio by adding Ethereum (ETH), alongside maintaining a position in Bitcoin (BTC). Hougan offered three compelling reasons for investors to embrace ETH, while also presenting a critical viewpoint for remaining invested solely in BTC.\n\nEthereum Vs. Bitcoin: 3 Reasons Pro-Ethereum\n\nHougan began by emphasizing the importance of diversification within crypto investments. Drawing an analogy to the early days of the internet, he pointed out how difficult it is to predict which technologies or companies will dominate over the long term. \u201cIt is very hard to predict the future with precision,\u201d Hougan remarked, referring to investors who bet on early internet companies like AOL and Pets.com, which failed to maintain their initial promise despite the internet\u2019s overall growth.\n\nApplying this lesson to crypto, Hougan advised a diversified approach to hedge against similar uncertainties. Ethereum\u2019s current market capitalization stands at approximately $420 billion, which is substantial but still only about one-third that of Bitcoin\u2019s $1.3 trillion market cap. Given these figures, Hougan proposed a default starting allocation of 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum for investors seeking broad market exposure.\n\nHougan\u2019s second point delved into the functional differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. He described Bitcoin as primarily \u201ca new form of money,\u201d highlighting its design choices aimed at enhancing its utility as a robust monetary system. \u201cEvery design choice the Bitcoin ecosystem makes is designed to make Bitcoin the best form of money that has ever existed,\u201d he stated, underscoring Bitcoin\u2019s targeted development toward optimizing its use as a currency.\n\nConversely, Ethereum is characterized by its role as a foundational technology for building new applications that leverage its capability for programmable money. This includes everything from issuing stablecoins to enabling complex decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s primary function is making money programmable,\u201d Hougan explained. He argued that the ongoing development within the Ethereum ecosystem provides a broader exposure to the potential applications of blockchain technology, which is still in its nascent stages.\n\nThe third argument for Ethereum centered on historical performance data. Hougan pointed out that historically, portfolios that included Ethereum along with Bitcoin showed better performance metrics, both in absolute terms and when adjusted for risk, across full crypto market cycles.\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing about that table is that the +ETH portfolio has both higher returns and a lower maximum drawdown,\u201d he highlighted. This historical analysis suggests that Ethereum could offer better downside protection and higher potential returns, though Hougan cautioned that \u201cpast performance is no guarantee of future returns\u201d and noted that in shorter, recent periods, a Bitcoin-only strategy would have outperformed.\n\nCounterpoint: Why a Bitcoin-Only Strategy May Be Preferable\n\nAddressing the other side of the coin, Hougan discussed why many investors might prefer a Bitcoin-only strategy. This perspective is especially relevant for those concerned with macroeconomic issues like the degradation of fiat currencies and inflation.\n\nHougan posited that Bitcoin\u2019s dominant position and its community\u2019s focus on becoming a new form of money make it likely to continue leading this space. \u201cIt has a large lead, and size matters in money,\u201d he stated, supporting the idea that Bitcoin\u2019s simplicity and focused use-case as digital gold could be more appealing for certain strategic investments.\n\n\u201cMoney is a massive market. There\u2019s plenty of space for BTC to run if it succeeds. [\u2026] My view, in a word: If you want to make a broad bet on crypto and public blockchains, you should own multiple crypto assets. If you want to make a specific bet on a new form of digital money, buy Bitcoin,\u201d Hougan concluded.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,514.06."

        "content": "Bitcoin price faces rejection at the weekly resistance level of $67,147.\n\nEthereum price stabilizes near the $3,362 support level established on June 14.\n\nRipple price is encountering a barrier at $0.515, which aligns with its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price encounters resistance at weekly highs before retracing to seek support at a crucial level, while Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) align closely with Bitcoin's movements, gearing up to surpass resistance barriers and embark on upward rallies.\n\nBitcoin price encounters major resistance\n\nBitcoin price was rejected by the weekly resistance level of $67,147 on Monday and is currently trading inside a descending channel. The descending channel is drawn, joining multiple swing high points and swing low point levels between early June and mid-June, as shown in the one-day chart below.\n\nIf BTC continues to decline, it could find support at $62,451, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from a swing low of $56,523 on May 1 to a swing high of $71,994 on May 21.\n\nIf the $62,451 support holds and BTC breaks above the descending channel, it could rally 7.5% to reach its previous resistance level of $67,147.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart are below their respective mean levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels.\n\nThis development would provide additional momentum to the ongoing recovery rally.\n\nIf bullish sentiment prevails and the overall cryptocurrency market shows optimism, BTC may extend its rally by 6% from $67,147 to retest its previous resistance level of $71,280.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin price breaks and closes below its daily support level of $60,800, the bullish thesis could be invalidated, leading to a 4% crash, its weekly support level of $58,375.\n\nEthereum price outlook is optimistic\n\nEthereum price finds support around the June 14 low at $3,360. On Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted it a free pass, currently trading at $3,523\u2014the $3,360 low roughly hovers around the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,279.\n\nIf this support holds, ETH price could rally 5% from its current trading price of $3,523 to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily chart struggles to close above its mean level of 50, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) trades below its mean zero. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $3,292 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 13% crash to the previous support level of $2,864.\n\nRipple price shows promise\n\nRipple price faced resistance at $0.515, its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on Monday, and is currently trading at $0.490.\n\nIf the ripple price breaks above the 50-day EMA at $0.512, it could rise 7% from $0.499 to $0.532, its previous high of June 5.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily chart is below the 50 mean level, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is below its zero line. If bullish momentum persists, both momentum indicators must remain above their respective thresholds of 50 and zero. This would provide further support to the recovery rally.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if Ripple's daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, establishing a lower low on the daily chart would invalidate the bullish outlook. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

This decline aligns with the trend in its Netflow, which has seen a dominance of outflows over the past few days.\n\nWhat percentage of ETH is left on exchanges?\n\nThe Ethereum balance on exchanges has been declining over the past few weeks, with this decline becoming more prominent towards the end of the previous month.\n\nAn analysis of the chart on Glassnode showed that it recently declined to around 10.19%.\n\nAnalysis showed this was the lowest percentage supply on exchanges in about eight years.\n\nA study of the chart indicated that this was the first time since 2016 that the supply dropped to this level. The decline means that addresses holding ETH on exchanges have withdrawn their holdings.\n\nThe decrease in supply over the last few weeks is a positive sign for ETH, suggesting reduced selling pressure and potential accumulation by holders.\n\nMore Ethereum leave exchanges\n\nAn analysis of the exchange flow showed a dominance of outflows in the last few days. As of this writing, the netflow is -1,481, indicating that more Ethereum has left exchanges than has come in.\n\nThis current Netflow trend aligns with the exchange balance, which shows a reduced amount of ETH remaining on all exchanges.\n\nAnalyzing the ETH price trend\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum was trading at around $3,540, with an increase of approximately 1.7%.

        "title": "BNB Chain follows Ethereum with latest upgrade: Any impact on price? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Data showed that the latest upgrade could tank BNB Chain\u2019s revenue.\n\nBroader trader sentiment was positive, suggesting that BNB\u2019s price can retest $600.\n\nOn the 20th of June, BNB Chain, the decentralized blockchain ecosystem released a major update. According to the chain, through BEP 336, users on the network can make transactions with a 90% fee reduction.\n\nThe disclosure is synonymous with Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, which brought about a decrease in gas fees. Interestingly, BNB Chain did not deny that the EIP4844 inspired it. Concerning this it explained that,\n\n\u201cBEP 336 significantly lowers the cost of transactions on the BSC network by eliminating the need for permanent storage of certain data types.\u201d\n\nWill this affect revenue?\n\nHowever, it is important to mention that the development could affect BNB Chain\u2019s revenue. At press time, AMBCrypto observed that the project\u2019s revenue decreased from what it was on the 19th, according to Artemis data.\n\nNotably, fees gotten from transactions contribute a major quota to the revenue. Therefore, a further reduction could lead to another drop. BNB\u2019s price is another metric that the development could influence.\n\nAt press time, BNB changed hands at $585.37. This was a notable decrease from the all-time high it reached weeks ago.\n\nHowever, reduced transaction fees could mean increased demand for the BNB cryptocurrency. Should this be the case, the price of the coin might be able to approach its all-time high of $720.67 again.\n\nRegardless, it is important to assess what is happening on the network. As of this writing, AMBCrypto looked at the development activity.\n\nDevelopment improves while traders plan to take advantage\n\nDevelopment activity measures the work done in public GitHub repositories of a project. If the metric increases, it means that developers are committing more codes to ensure shipping of new features.\n\nHowever, a decrease implies that commitment to polishing the network is not at its peak. According to. data from Santiment, BNB \u2018s development activity jumped to its highest level since the 6th of May.\n\nThis implied an improvement in developer dedication. For the price, this rise could be bullish for the coin. Another indicator to evaluate is Funding Rate.\n\nThe idea behind assessing this indicator is to see if traders view the upgrade as a catalyst to drive a price increase or not.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, BNB\u2019s Funding Rate was 0.0020%. Positive values of the indicator implies that the contract price is trading at a premium to the spot price. In this case, trader sentiment is bullish.\n\nOn the other hand, a negative reading implies that the perpetual price is at a discount. Therefore, the broader trader sentiment is bearish.\n\nThus, the Funding Rate at press time, implies that longs are paying shorts a fee to keep their position open. Hence, the average trader expects BNB\u2019s price to increase.\n\nRead Binance Coin [BNB] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nBut for the price to increase, buying pressure in the spot market has to be increase.\n\nIf this happens, BNB\u2019s price can surpass $600 in the short-term. But if invalidated, the price of the coin might drop to $570."

        "content": "Thu 20 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nIn the dynamic world of crypto, investor confidence is often measured by their willingness to hold onto their assets through market highs and lows. Recently, Ethereum has signaled a resounding vote of confidence from its community, with a record number of long-term holders. These HODLers play a crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s future!\n\nLong-Term Holders Are Booming on Ethereum!\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, a notable concentration of Ethereum is held for periods ranging from 1 to 3 years! Indicating that much of the Ethereum acquired during the 2021-2022 period is still being held. This trend is reinforced by the decrease in the proportion of crypto held for less than six months, while the share held for more than seven years has increased. Reflecting the stability and faith in the fundamental value of Ethereum and its potential for future growth.\n\nThe Ethereum HODL Waves chart illustrates the distribution of Ethereum held over various periods. This reveals changing trends in the holding behavior of crypto investors. The recent surge in long-term holders suggests a conviction in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value! This, with a significant portion of investors choosing to hold their assets rather than sell in response to market fluctuations.\n\nCrypto \u2013 Ethereum HODLers\n\nThe Influence of HODLers on the Future of Crypto\n\nLong-term Ethereum holders play a crucial role in stabilizing and growing the crypto. By holding their assets, they reduce volatility and create a sense of confidence that attracts new investors. Their long-term vision also encourages the development of innovative projects on the Ethereum blockchain. This, in turn, fosters a richer and more diverse ecosystem.\n\nThis HODLing strategy can positively influence Ethereum\u2019s future, positioning it as a leading digital currency with increased global adoption and usage. However, despite these positive prospects, it is important to note that cryptos remain a high-risk activity. Everything can change at any moment!\n\nThe behavior of long-term Ethereum holders suggests a strong belief in the long-term potential of crypto. Their strategy being beneficial, could be an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s growing maturity as an investment asset.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum market value to real value (MVRV) is outpacing Bitcoin and other assets ahead of the anticipated altcoin season. This metric points to increased positive fundamentals in the market amid the decline in prices sparked by a fall in sentiments. Major drivers of ETH performance are the upcoming Ethereum ETF listings and whale accumulations.\n\nEthereum MVRV Outpaces Bitcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s MVRV is moving higher than market leader Bitcoin amid a slew of industry factors. New data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows the trend suggests hitting up the ETH market in relation to its fundamentals.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering early alt season. $ETH MVRV is rising faster than BTC MVRV, suggesting the ETH market is heating up relative to its on-chain fundamentals. Given the current ETF situation, this might be an ETH-only season. Historically, when ETH surges, other alts tend to follow.\u201d\n\nThe altcoin season is expected to see a rally in assets but recent events point to an Ethereum-only season according to the data. However, gains will be seen in other altcoins due to the effect of ETH on the market. The asset\u2019s recent surge to $3,700 before a price correction boosted similar sentiments in altcoins and meme tokens.\n\nInstitutional investors increased their appetite for Ethereum after the success of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024. This led to inflows into investment products taking most funds out of the red zone in terms of yearly figures.\n\nETF and Accumulation Drive Sentiments\n\nPotential ETF listings have ignited bullish signals leading to a rise in ETH momentum. The initial approval saw its price soar 22% before falling alongside the market. Bulls project billions of inflows to Ethereum because of its smart contract capabilities and existing market utility.\n\nSimilarly, on-chain data shows the accumulation of the asset despite a price fall. Several analysts have projected the price to tap $4,000 post Ethereum ETF listing coupled with positive macroeconomic factors like cooling inflation and interest rate cuts.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Appeals $4.4M Fine by Canada\u2019s FINTRAC Over AML Violations\n\nDavid Pokima David is a finance news contributor with 4 years of experience in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "XRP holders wonder how SEC will treat Ripple as Ethereum gets free pass - FXStreet",
        "content": "The court decision is a partial summary judgment. The ruling can be appealed once a final judgment is issued or if the judge allows it before then. The case is in a pretrial phase, in which both Ripple and the SEC still have the chance to settle.\n\nThe SEC has stepped up its enforcement actions toward the blockchain and digital assets industry, filing charges against platforms such as Coinbase or Binance for allegedly violating the US Securities law. The SEC claims that the majority of crypto assets are securities and thus subject to strict regulation. While defendants can use parts of Ripple\u2019s ruling in their favor, the SEC can also find reasons in it to keep its current strategy of regulation by enforcement.\n\nThe ruling offers a partial win for both Ripple and the SEC, depending on what one looks at. Ripple gets a big win over the fact that programmatic sales aren\u2019t considered securities, and this could bode well for the broader crypto sector as most of the assets eyed by the SEC\u2019s crackdown are handled by decentralized entities that sold their tokens mostly to retail investors via exchange platforms, experts say. Still, the ruling doesn\u2019t help much to answer the key question of what makes a digital asset a security, so it isn\u2019t clear yet if this lawsuit will set precedent for other open cases that affect dozens of digital assets. Topics such as which is the right degree of decentralization to avoid the \u201csecurity\u201d label or where to draw the line between institutional and programmatic sales are likely to persist.\n\nThe United States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Ripple and its executives of raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered asset offering of the XRP token. While the judge ruled that programmatic sales aren\u2019t considered securities, sales of XRP tokens to institutional investors are indeed investment contracts. In this last case, Ripple did breach the US securities law and will need to keep litigating over the around $729 million it received under written contracts.\n\nIt depends on the transaction, according to a court ruling released on July 14: For institutional investors or over-the-counter sales, XRP is a security. For retail investors who bought the token via programmatic sales on exchanges, on-demand liquidity services and other platforms, XRP is not a security.\n\nOn the contrary, if Ripple closes under $0.4665, the April 19 low, it could invalidate the bullish thesis. XRP could find the next support at the June 7 low of $0.4508.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crossed over the signal line, with green histogram bars flashing above the neutral line, supporting a bullish thesis for XRP. If this upside scenario unfolds, Ripple could rally towards resistance at $0.5326, coinciding with the June 5 high.\n\nXRP gained nearly 1% on Thursday, as seen on the daily chart . The altcoin is trading at $0.4963 on Binance at the time of writing, gaining nearly 1% in the past seven days but losing nearly 8% in the past 30 days.\n\nA big win for Consensys, though questions remain. Does this mean the SEC thinks Consensys\u2019 offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions and/or that ETH itself is not a security? What will Gensler say if now asked? What is the status of MetaMask and staking? This is\u2026\n\nRipple (XRP) holders debate the future of the altcoin on Thursday, which could be closely related to the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) next step following its decision to end the investigation into Ethereum (ETH).\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "The SEC has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, dropping allegations that Ether sales are securities.\n\nConsensys argued that recent ETF approvals implied ETH is a commodity, leading to the investigation\u2019s closure.\n\nThe decision may spark discussions on listing other altcoin ETFs, but Consensys emphasises ongoing challenges in the crypto industry.\n\nIn a major breakthrough for the crypto industry, Consensys, a private blockchain software technology company founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, just announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into Ethereum.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nConsensys announced, \u201cthe Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0\u201d.\n\nRelated: Bloomberg Reports Elon Musk Plans To Turn X Into Next Venmo, Will Crypto Play a Role?\n\nThis includes dropping allegations that sales of Ether are securities \u2013 a long-debated question among the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLubin\u2019s company said this comes after they asked the SEC on 7 June to confirm ETH\u2019s status as a commodity following the recent exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision in the US.\n\nIn late May the regulator gave the green light for the listing of Ether ETFs on several US exchanges. The 19b-4 approval signifies that trading on these exchanges now only requires S-1 approval.\n\nA step many saw as a de facto greenlighting of Ethereum as a commodity.\n\nDecision to Spark More Altcoin ETF Talks\n\nThe SEC dropping the investigation could lead to more talk about altcoin ETFs being listed. Recently, both Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Tether co-founder William Quigley voiced their expectations of several other altcoins fund listings in the near future.\n\nQuigley believes ADA (Cardano) and SOL (Solana) could be next for an ETF, while Garlinghouse also believes an XRP ETF is in the cards.\n\nHowever, Consensys also said in their statement on X that, while great news, the decision to drop the Ethereum investigation is not a miracle cure for all the issues in the crypto industry.\n\nThe closing of the Ethereum investigation is momentous, but it\u2019s not a cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under SEC\u2019s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime. Consensys Consensys\n\nThe statement added that Consensys would continue the fight, especially regarding the status of crypto wallet MetaMask and swaps and staking within the wallet.\n\nOur fight continues. In our lawsuit, we also seek a declaration that offering the user interface software MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate the securities laws. It should not take a lawsuit to provide the much-needed regulatory clarity to allow an industry that serves\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nBackground of SEC Investigation\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, led by Gurbir Grewal, initiated an investigation in March 2023 into Ethereum transactions dating back to 2018.\n\nThe probe came to light when the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub mentioned scrutiny from a \u201cstate authority,\u201d later identified as the SEC.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin NFTs Surpass Ronin with Record $148 Million All-Time Sales in Last 30 Days\n\nIn April, Consensys sued the SEC, seeking confirmation that ETH is not a security. The SEC decided to close the investigation after Consensys argued that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs indicated that ETH is a commodity, not a security."

        "content": "Ethereum price struggled to climb above the $3,650 resistance and trimmed gains. ETH is now signaling a downside break and might decline below $3,450.\n\nEthereum is trimming gains from the $3,620 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a short-term rising channel forming with support at $3,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bearish momentum if it dips below the $3,485 and $3,450 support levels.\n\nEthereum Price Trims Gains\n\nEthereum price started a decent increase above the $3,500 zone. ETH outperformed Bitcoin and broke the $3,550 resistance. However, the price struggled to surpass the $3,620 level and failed to test $3,650.\n\nA high was formed at $3,620 and the price is now trimming gains. There was a minor decline below the $3,550 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,351 swing low to the $3,620 high.\n\nThere was a break below a short-term rising channel forming with support at $3,540 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum is still trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe bulls are now active near the $3,485 support zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,351 swing low to the $3,620 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3,520 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,560 level.\n\nThe main resistance sits at $3,620 or $3,650. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,720, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,750 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,880 resistance zone in the coming days.\n\nMore Downsides In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,560 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,485. The first major support is $3,450.\n\nA clear move below the $3,450 support might push the price toward $3,420. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,350 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,450\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,560"

        "title": "Ethereum At A Crossroads: Big Move Coming After Consolidation Phase? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently at a critical juncture as its price enters a consolidation phase. This period of price stability, marked by a narrow trading range, has left traders and investors in a state of uncertainty.\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price hovering around key support and resistance levels, market participants are closely monitoring technical indicators and market signals to anticipate the next move. The current consolidation reflects a balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution, creating an environment of indecision that could lead to significant volatility once a breakout direction is established.\n\nThis analysis delves into examining Ethereum\u2019s current price state to determine its potential future price action.\n\nMarket Overview: Ethereum Current Trends And Analysis\n\nCurrently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of Ethereum is moving upward toward the upper level of the consolidation zone, but it is still trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).\n\nA careful examination of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that ETH\u2019s price may still move upward as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are trending above the zero line. From this formation, it can be suggested that Ethereum may likely move to test the upper base of the consolidation before dropping again.\n\nOn the 1-day chart, ETH is actively bullish moving toward the upper base of the consolidation zone while still trading above the 100-day SMA. With the way ETH\u2019s price is moving, it may move on to test the upper base of the consolidation.\n\nThe 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator indicator reveals that although ETH is currently bullish, it may go bearish in the long run as both the signal line and the SMA are attempting to cross below the zero line.\n\nPotential Scenarios: What\u2019s Next For ETH?\n\nA look at potential future scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s movement post-consolidation suggests that if the price of ETH breaks above the upper base of the consolidation, it will begin to move upward toward the $4,099 resistance level. If the price breaches this level, it may move on to test its all-time high of $4,863.\n\nIn contrast, should the crypto asset break below the lower base of the consolidation, it will begin to move downward toward the $2,865 support level. If this level is breached, it will continue to move downward to test the $2,147 and probably other lower levels.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $3,607 and was down by 1.82% with a market capitalization of over $440 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $13 billion. Although its market capitalization is down by 1.77%, its trading volume has increased by 28.93% in the past day.\n\nFeatured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn.\n\nChristian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats \u2013 a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later).\n\nChristian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley!\n\nSo, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill).\n\nThink Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair.\n\nSpeaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin\u2019 helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better.\n\nHere's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies.\n\nLooking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.\n\nSo, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words \u2013 the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been conquering traditional finance attention, especially among relevant institutional players. Now, Standard Chartered, a banking giant with over $822 billion in assets under management (AUM), has also made its move.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, Standard Chartered plans to offer Ether and Bitcoin (BTC) in a new crypto trading desk. If accomplished, the move will make StanChart the first major global bank to offer this service.\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional clients to trade bitcoin and Ethereum, in line with our strategy to support clients across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,\u201d the bank said in a statement.\n\nFurthermore, the bank already holds stakes in crypto-focused firms like Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets. Standard Chartered launched Libeara, a blockchain unit, to help institutions tokenize real-world assets, a use case leveraged by Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nThe bank remains bullish on the crypto sector, predicting Bitcoin will hit $150,000 in 2024, as reported by Finbold. In this context, we asked ChatGPT-4o for a price prediction on Ethereum, considering the recent support from Standard Chartered.\n\nChatGPT-4o Ethereum price prediction with Standard Chartered spot trading\n\nNotably, OpenAI\u2018s flagship product, ChatGPT-4o, mentioned that increased institutional adoption is a driving factor for Ethereum\u2019s demand. The artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot provided three scenarios addressing a bullish, a moderate, and a bearish outlook.\n\nFirst, ChatGPT forecasts ETH to trade between $6,000 and $9,000 by mid-2025. This forecast assumes positive regulatory developments, successfully launched Ethereum spot ETFs, and increased institutional adoption.\n\nA more moderate scenario puts Ether, the native token, between $4,500 to $6,000 by mid-2025, considering a sustained but not explosive influx of institutional funds. Meanwhile, Ethereum could remain at its current level between $3,000 to $4,000 if things do not play out as expected.\n\nChatGPT-4o Ethereum price prediction. Source: NanoGPT\n\nEthereum (ETH) price analysis\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum trades at $3,496 per token, showing strong momentum in the one-year price chart. The leading Web3 cryptocurrency has gained 86% year-over-year, getting its launchpad ready for a significant surge if everything goes favorably.\n\nA rally to the AI targets would result in up to 157% gains from current prices.\n\nEthereum (ETH) one-year price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nHowever, ChatGPT-4o can make mistakes, and ETH\u2019s success depends highly on the demand that its network can attract. Cryptocurrencies continue to be developed, some offering remarkable competitive advantages over Ethereum. Investors must be cautious and actively do their research to keep up-to-date with the market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) Chairman, Jay Clayton revealed in a Monday interview with CNBC that there is now an increased chance of seeing a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) go live for U.S investors soon.\n\nClayton made the revelation while answering questions regarding how far crypto market participants seeking the listing of a Bitcoin ETF have satisfied concerns expressed by the SEC regarding such a product.\n\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s work left to be done,\u201d said Clayton who had in the past mentioned perceived market price manipulation on unregulated exchanges and unreliable custody as the primary reasons why the SEC hasn\u2019t blessed any of the Bitcoin ETF proposals it has received so far.\n\nOnce again, the SEC Chairman highlighted those concerns as tough questions, before saying,\n\n\u201cNow, progress is being made, but people needed to answer those hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate type of product.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the latest comments made by the SEC Chairman raises hopes that there is yet a possibility of seeing the first Bitcoin ETF launch later this year or at least sooner than many had envisaged.\n\nAs Coinfomania reported last month, the SEC must now rule on whether or not to approve proposed rule changes to list Bitcoin ETFs submitted by Bitwise and VanEck/SolidX. These filings were published in the federal register in February kickstarting a 240-day waiting period for a final decision by the SEC.\n\nHowever, the regulator has delayed deciding on three occasions and must now rule on October 13, 2019, whether or not to approve the Bitwise ETF application, and make a similar decision regarding the VanEck/SolidX on October 18, 2019.\n\nIt is also vital to note that there is a possibility that the SEC decides against approving the current proposals [with only roughly a month remaining] since Clayton also mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s work left to be done.\u201d"

The cryptocurrency's shielded transactions ensure that user information and transaction details remain private. Zcash\u2019s emphasis on privacy has made it a popular choice among miners and users who prioritize confidentiality. The profitability of mining Zcash is bolstered by its robust privacy features and ongoing developments within the network.\n\nThe Most Profitable Crypto to Mine\n\nAs we explore the top 5 most profitable cryptocurrencies to mine, BlockDAG stands out with its innovative approach to mobile and cloud mining. Its user-friendly apps, energy-efficient consensus algorithm, and high-capacity mining rigs offer a comprehensive solution for miners.\n\nWhile Ethereum, Kaspa, Dash, and Zcash also present profitable opportunities, BlockDAG\u2019s unique technology and recent advancements position it as a leader in the crypto-mining industry.
