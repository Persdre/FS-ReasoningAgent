        "title": "Ethereum to phase out its Goerli testnet \u2013 What now? - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "The Sepolia testnet would become the new test layer for developers.\n\nHolesky would also have a new function.\n\nIf things go as the Ethereum [ETH] Foundation has planned, the project will no longer support the Goerli testnet. This information was disclosed on 30th November in a post published on the foundation\u2019s blog.\n\nGoerli is Ethereum\u2019s first multi-client testnet. It is responsible for providing developers with a reliable test environment for applications built on the blockchain.\n\nIn the statement, the foundation noted that the halt on the operation would take place after the Dencun upgrade. The statement read:\n\n\u201cEither three months after the Goerli Dencun activation, or one month after the Dencun Mainnet activation, whichever comes later, teams will begin exiting their validators. Anyone relying on Goerli as a stable Testnet should migrate elsewhere prior to this.\u201d\n\nMove to a new land\n\nDencun is short from Cancun-Denub upgrade. According to Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, the upgrade would take place on the execution and consensus layer.\n\nAlso, the aim of the upgrade is to provide a user-friendly experience for developers and users.\n\nThe foundation has advised developers using Goerli for testing to switch to Sepolia. Sepolia is the default Testnet for smart contract development on the blockchain. Concerning the development, the team explained that:\n\n\u201cApplication and tooling developers are encouraged to use Sepolia to test decentralized applications, smart contracts, and other EVM functionality.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto checked if these updates affected Ethereum\u2019s development activity.\n\nA look at Santiment\u2019s data showed that the development activity metric rose till 30th November. But, at press time, the metric had declined to 2.41.\n\nDevelopment activity measures the commitment developers have toward new features on a network. So, the slight decrease means users should not expect new functionalities on Ethereum.\n\nTraction drops, but\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, network growth on the blockchain also decreased. Network growth measures the number of new addresses interacting with a project. If the metric increases, it implies an increase in traction.\n\nTherefore, the drop suggests that ETH\u2019s adoption decreased. Also, new addresses who joined the network have refrained from making transactions. Another area the Ethereum Foundation touched on was staking.\n\nStaking on Ethereum is one activity that has experienced a surge in growth.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) means that Goerli had a role in the activity. Regarding the activity, the foundation mentioned that stakers should use the newly launched Holesky Testnet.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nThis move means that the foundation had fulfilled its promise that Holesky would replace Goerli as Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure and protocol-developer Testnet.\n\nAlso, validators were asked to consider the Ephemery Testnet for lightweight end-to-end testing."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently displayed remarkable bullish behavior as the price broke through a critical resistance level. The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

Economic conditions and investor sentiment also play a crucial role. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Market Cap: ETH\u2019s possibility of surpassing Bitcoin in market capitalization is uncertain, dependent on factors like adoption rates and network upgrades. Bitcoin currently leads with a significantly higher market cap.\n\n\u2018There is Potential for Ethereum\u2019\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is yet another digital asset that has experienced a rapid price increase since the beginning of 2023. It currently trades at around $2,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), with some wondering whether a new all-time high (ATH) could be achieved next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a development could indeed occur should several vital factors be in place. The AI-powered language model noted market trends and technological advancements as the main ones.\n\nIt outlined Ethereum\u2019s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), suggesting other improvements of this type could be bullish for the asset.\n\nChatGPT estimated that positive regulatory developments might encourage institutional investments and thus trigger a rally. On the other hand, stricter rules could have the opposite effect.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, investor sentiment, adoption by mainstream finance, and historical performance are other elements worth observing.\n\nLastly, ChatGPT suggested that the potential rise of different blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies could impact Ethereum, too.\n\n\u201cGiven these factors, while there is potential for Ethereum to reach new highs, it\u2019s important to approach such predictions with caution and consider the inherent risks and uncertainties of cryptocurrency investments,\u201d the AI language model concluded.\n\nCould ETH Flip BTC: Flippening Possible?\n\nAnother interesting question that has been circulating in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time is whether Ethereum could eventually outpace Bitcoin and become the largest digital asset by market capitalization. On that note, several months ago, we asked ChatGPT if such a scenario is plausible in the next five years.\n\nThe language model explained that this outcome is \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d The primary ones are adoption rates and network upgrades. Overall economic condition, inflation, and other financial aspects are also worth considering, ChatGPT assumed.\n\nAs of the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization stands at over $750 billion, representing a dominance of around 50%. Ethereum is second with a market cap of approximately $250 billion, meaning it has a long way to go before flippening the leader."

        "content": "For the major period of November, the Ethereum (ETH) coin witnessed high volatility leading to a sideways trend between the $2,143 and $1,910 price levels. However, this consolidation came after a significant rally indicating the buyers could have an opportunity to recuperate the bullish momentum after the further rally. Thus, a recent breakout from the range barrier sets the ETH price to further rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Data Indicates Roadblock Ahead\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Hit $3000?\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would set a directional uptrend\n\nThe rising price could face intense supply around $2250.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nCoinciding with the Bitcoin price ascent over the $38,000 mark, a renewed sense of optimism has begun to permeate the crypto market. Responding to this positive shift, the ETH price rebounded from the psychologically significant $2,000 mark, registering a 7.8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,153.\n\nDuring this rally, the Ethereum price surpassed the immediate resistance of $2,133, suggesting that buyers are poised to drive the price even higher. Despite a modest intraday loss of 0.5%, a retest of this breached resistance could confirm its role as a new support level, underpinning the buyer\u2019s ability to sustain higher price levels.\n\nHowever, with only a 3.5% increase, the ETH price is approaching a significant resistance level formed by the wedge pattern. Historical trends indicate that this trendline has often led to increased selling pressure and notable price declines.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive breakout above this barrier is crucial for confirming a more robust uptrend. Should the Ethereum price successfully navigate this challenge, its price could potentially soar by 50%, reaching around $3,400.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nLong-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals that both cryptocurrencies gained considerable momentum since mid-October. However, the Bitcoin price has demonstrated a more substantial recovery, characterized by a consistent pattern of higher highs and lows. On the other hand, the ETH price has faced some challenges, particularly noticeable supply pressure around the $2,200 mark.\n\nBollinger band: The uptick in the Bollinger band indicator reflects that buyers are aggressive and ready to buy ETH at a higher price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: a bullish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) line, accentuates a recovery sentiment return in this asset.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

Several assets \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Celestia (TIA) \u2014 registered impressive gains.\n\nBitcoin nears $40,000\n\nBitcoin has been on a rampage since breaking out of the consolidation in early October. The premier crypto has continued to register impressive bullish closes, and this week was no different. With a 5.41% increase over the past seven days, Bitcoin is on track to record its seventh consecutive bullish week.\n\nBTC price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nThis streak of bullish closes began in mid-October when the asset changed hands at the $27,000 territory. Amid increased optimism from sustained ETF discussions, Bitcoin has extended the wins to seven straight weeks.\n\nThis week was less challenging than most, as BTC only registered two days of mild intraday declines. These declines came up on Nov. 27 (0.56%) and Nov. 30 (0.37%). Other days recorded bullish gains, but Dec. 1 stood out, as BTC surged 2.54%, marking its highest intraday gain for the week.\n\nThis Dec. 1 rally brought BTC the closest to the $39,000 territory in 17 months. The asset spiked to $38,983 but witnessed bearish resistance. BTC showed resilience, closing Dec. 1 at $38,688 to have another go at $39,000 the following day.\n\nThis second push was successful, helping Bitcoin reclaim $39,000 for the first time since the Terra implosion of last May. Bitcoin has built on this rally, changing hands at $39,489 at the reporting time, with the $40,000 price threshold its next target.\n\nYou might also like: Hong Kong, Singapore attract increasing crypto VC funding\n\nEthereum hits 17-month high\n\nBitcoin\u2019s uptrend favorably impacted Ethereum\u2019s price, as both assets maintained their close correlation this week. Ethereum started the week with mixed signals, dropping 1.71% on Nov. 27, but rising 0.99% the next day. Nov. 29 also brought another decline, with a 0.90% slide.\n\nETH price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s bullish story began on Nov. 30 despite BTC\u2019s 0.37% drop. ETH rallied 1.12% that day, extending this bullish run to the new month. The asset gained 1.72% on Dec. 1, with its largest intraday gain amounting to a 3.75% surge on Dec. 2.\n\nThe Dec. 2 rally was Ethereum\u2019s major boost this week, as the asset leveraged it to hit a 17-month high of $2,184. Despite facing a roadblock at this new yearly peak, the bulls retained their hold, keeping Ethereum above $2,100 at the close of day. Currently trading for $2,164, ETH is up 4.97% this week.\n\nCelestia clinches new ATH in 60% weekly gain\n\nCelestia was not left out in the market-wide uptrend this week. While Bitcoin and Ethereum flashed mixed signals at the start of the week, TIA went full-on bullish, surging 8.17% on Nov. 27 and 6.06% on Nov. 28. The following day was not very favorable, leading to a 3.53% decline.\n\nTIA price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nHowever, these drops did nothing to negate the ongoing uptrend. Celestia rallied by a massive 42% from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, recording three consecutive days of bullish momentum. Amid this momentum, TIA began recording new all-time highs on Dec. 2. The asset\u2019s latest ATH was $9.31 today.\n\nCelestia\u2019s massive uptrend put it among the top gainers over the past seven days. The asset is up 61% this week, securing third among the largest gainers. Celestia is facing a 0.48% drop today, but the asset has held up well above $8.5, currently changing hands at $8.81."

This represents a major step toward lowering transaction fees and boosting adoption for the DeFi lending platform.\n\nAdditionally, Goldfinch\u2019s native GFI token surged 14% to $1.74 following news of the expansion on December 1.\n\nGFI Price | Source: Tradingview\n\nAs an Ethereum-exclusive project until now, the shift to a more affordable layer-2 network will enable greater accessibility by reducing prohibitively high gas fees on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nGoldfinch co-founder Blake West and engineering manager Greg Egan were strong proponents for the move to Base, citing the blockchain\u2019s rapidly growing total value locked of over $300 million. They also referred to Coinbase\u2019s massive user base over 100 million worldwide that Base apps can leverage.\n\nAs one of the largest centralized crypto exchanges that recently went public, Coinbase\u2019s support provides credibility and a built-in customer pipeline that will accelerate DeFi adoption. Goldfinch aims to take advantage of Base as a customer acquisition channel going forward.\n\nThis latest development comes on the heels of Goldfinch marking the full repayment of its first-issued loan to crypto lender Fazz Financial in late November. The successful repayment of this genesis loan is a promising indicator for the newly expanded lending protocol."

I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nThe outburst comes after Rune Christensen, MakerDAO co-founder and CEO revealed plans to remove the protocol\u2019s NewChain from Ethereum and fork it on the Solana blockchain. While his intentions may have been harmless, the community received it as a battle of the best between Solana and Ethereum. To Yakovenko, however, this battle can only be detrimental to the ecosystem.\n\nDiscrediting the perception that \u201cSolana thrives and somehow Ethereum dies,\u201d Yakovenko demonstrates optimism in Danksharding being able to have adequate bandwidth to contain the entire expanse of Solana data.\n\nNotably, Danksharding is a technology that enables blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks. It is an Ethereum rollup scaling method that expands transactional throughput by increasing storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time Yakovenko is attempting to quell the Solana versus Ethereum feud. In an October citing, jebus.eth, an Ethereum community member took shots at Solana, likening it to the Democrat Party of crypto. He called it a \u201cCoalition of poors and wealthy people,\u201d who lack an understanding of value and its source, adding that it was a group of people who prioritized cheap over value.\n\nSol is like the dem party of crypto\n\n\n\nCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don't understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap \u2014 Jebus.eth (@jebus911) October 1, 2023\n\nIn response, Yakovenko defended, \u201cIn the grand theatre of economic transformation, Ethereum presents itself not as a harbinger of genuine revolution, but merely as a novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price remains committed to the north, boasting a 2% surge on the day, accompanied by an 11% climb in trading volume. The parity between price and trading volume points to strong interest in the asset by buyers. It also points to higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting a buyer and seller.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading for $63.58, with eyes peeled on the $70.00 mark amid rising momentum and the presence of bulls in the SOL market. This is indicated by the northbound RSI and the green histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in the positive territory."

        "content": "The quest to quantify blockchain decentralization has led to various metrics, with the Nakamoto Coefficient being one of the prominent measures. However, in the recent listings of blockchains by their degree of decentralization, Cardano was notably absent from the top ranks, a position that has sparked curiosity and debate within the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano is often distinguished from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains due to its unique network structure and operational mechanics. Unlike Ethereum, which runs on the EVM, allowing for interoperability and similar structures across various networks, Cardano employs a different approach with its Ouroboros consensus algorithm.\n\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, but it diverges from the standard PoS mechanisms. It is designed to achieve consensus in a more energy-efficient and scalable way. This dedication to a scientific philosophy in its protocol development sets Cardano apart, which may contribute to why it is often considered separately from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe distinctiveness of Cardano's architecture is complemented by its layered structure. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL) operate independently, which differentiates its operational functions from those of other blockchains where these layers are typically intertwined.\n\nCardano's network also emphasizes a community-driven approach to governance and development. The project's catalyst funds and the Voltaire phase, which aims to introduce a fully decentralized decision-making process, are testaments to its commitment to a high degree of decentralization, albeit not necessarily captured by the Nakamoto Coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano's method of staking and block production involves a randomized process for electing slot leaders, which is different from Ethereum's process. This adds another layer of complexity when comparing the two networks based on the number of entities that can collectively shut down or control the network, as the Nakamoto Coefficient attempts to measure."

        "content": "The blockchain world witnessed a transformative change with Ethereum\u2019s shift to a more eco-friendly framework. This significant move, known as \u201cthe Merge,\u201d transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake system. The result? A dramatically reduced carbon footprint by roughly 99.97%. That makes Ethereum a leading example in the blockchain space for environmental responsibility.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s Carbon Footprint Reduction\n\nRecent research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) and the Ethereum Climate Platform (ECP) shines a light on this groundbreaking development. The study, presented at COP28, emphasizes the historical carbon footprint of Ethereum.\n\nIt was a staggering 27.5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (MtCO2e). This figure puts into perspective the impact of crypto technology on the environment and its potential role in advancing sustainability. Thankfully, it is much lower today, at 2.5 KtCO 2 e.\n\nA key element in this discourse is the concept of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These are non-binding national plans focusing on climate change mitigation and setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The intersection of NDCs and blockchain technology is pivotal. It demonstrates how digital platforms can aid countries in achieving their environmental goals.\n\nEthereum Climate Platform: A Collaborative Effort\n\nThe ECP, established by Allinfra and Consensys, is at the forefront of addressing Ethereum\u2019s environmental impact. Their recent partnership with Earthshot prize winner Boomitra targets mitigating one million tonnes of CO\u2082. This initiative marks a significant effort in addressing Ethereum\u2019s historical carbon emissions. Over the coming years, the ECP plans to drive investment towards rectifying this legacy, utilizing its digital tools and network of carbon market experts.\n\nAnna Lerner, executive director of the ECP, emphasizes the importance of this research. She calls it a wake-up call for the industry to decarbonize influential technologies like blockchain. Lerner stresses the need for blockchain businesses to take responsibility, adopt sustainable practices, and address their carbon emissions.\n\nBill Kentrup, co-founder of Allinfra, reflects on the findings as a significant step forward. He highlights the near-complete decarbonization of the Ethereum ecosystem as an inspiring achievement. Kentrup urges the global tech and business community to join the battle against climate change by supporting genuinely green projects.\n\nThe Future of Sustainable Blockchain And Crypto\n\nSteven Haft, head of global partnerships at Consensys, points out Ethereum\u2019s significant standing in the blockchain world. He views the \u2018greened\u2019 Ethereum and Web3 technology as attractive for climate-focused projects. Haft emphasizes the Ethereum Climate Platform\u2019s commitment to addressing Ethereum\u2019s past environmental impact and using research as a foundation for future sustainability pledges.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake system marks a pivotal moment in the blockchain industry\u2019s journey toward sustainability. A 99.97% reduction in emissions is significant. Current annual emission rates equate to 5 round-trip airplane flights from London to New York. Furthermore, the network is powered by nearly 48% sustainable energy (32% renewables and 16% nuclear). There is still room for improvement, but the overall change is significant."

(@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nSolana Lauded as an ETH Killer\n\nThe layer-1 Solana network was created to offer smart contract capabilities like the Ethereum network. However, it supersedes the Ethereum mainnet regarding speed and energy efficiency thanks to its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain implemented the energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The network also processed only about 30 transactions per second, compared to Solana\u2019s record of 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nDue to its inherent features, the Solana network has been lauded as an ETH killer since its official launch in 2020. The term has also been used to describe some popular blockchains such as Cardano, Tezos, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\nSolana has also introduced toolsets to onboard developers from the Ethereum network into its ecosystem. In July, Solana Labs launched Solang, a compiler enabling developers familiar with Ethereum\u2019s programming language (Solidity) to write smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.\n\nDescribing the expression as \u201clame,\u201d Yakovenko argued that even though Solana and Ethereum have similarities, the latter will not be overshadowed by the initial.\n\nSolana Ranks Among Best Performing Cryptocurrencies\n\nAmong the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s SOL emerged as the best performer. Maintaining its ranking as the sixth-largest crypto by market capitalization, SOL has soared by over 220% in the last three months alone. These metrics supersede crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nGoing from as low as $17.9 to as high as $65.2, market experts suggest that the cryptocurrency will likely surpass the $70 price mark as active addresses increase. Presently, SOL trades at $63.8, representing 2.7% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinStats"
