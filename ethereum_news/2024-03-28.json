        "content": "The rapidly rising validator count on the Ethereum blockchain following the Shapella upgrade in April last year is causing concerns about technical capacity and centralization, Fidelity Digital Assets wrote in a research report on Thursday.\n\n\n\nFidelity noted that \u201cwith the lowered risk from increased liquidity, the active validator count has risen by 74%,\u201d and said \u201cfuture roadmap upgrades will become more difficult\u201d with this larger set.\n\n\n\nThe Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals, for the first time, for validators who staked their ether (ETH) to secure and validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\n\n\nA large validator count is a concern because \u201cbandwidth and latency are critical in a large validator set network, where each validator must independently download the latest data and verify state change proposals within a small time frame,\u201d analyst Daniel Gray wrote, adding that \u201cthe larger the block (data), the more computing power needed to process and re-execute the transactions before the next slot.\u201d\n\n\n\nEvery new validator adds a further connection to the network which increases the overall bandwidth that is needed to maintain consensus, the note said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe potential concern is that as the bandwidth requirements grow, the validators that are unable to keep pace will drop from the network - those that drop are more likely to be the self-hosted nodes,\u201d Gray wrote. \u201cIf the average household struggles to keep up with the network, there is a risk of increased centralization over time, as the only hardware to survive may live within institution-owned data centers,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nWhile the growth in the size of the validator set has slowed recently, it's unclear what the situation may be in a year from now, the report said; \u201ctherefore, the possibility of rapid growth could be a problem due to centralization and bandwidth risks.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe challenge of an expanding validator count has always been viewed as a \u201cgood problem\u201d as it represents increased adoption and security for the Ethereum blockchain. Still \u201cit is impossible to accurately predict the staking demand in the future,\u201d the report added."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin discusses what is next for Ethereum, following Dencun hard fork - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that following the Dencun hard fork, scaling on Ethereum is no longer a \u201czero-to-one\u201d problem but rather a \u201cone-to-N\u201d problem.\n\nInitially, Ethereum\u2019s development was centered around building its foundational infrastructure, effectively going from non-existence (zero) to establishing the baseline of a functional ecosystem (one). This phase was marked by significant challenges, like limited scalability and high transaction fees. These issues constrained Ethereum\u2019s ability to support widespread adoption of dapps and maintain operational efficiency.\n\nFollowing the Dencun update, Ethereum has pivoted to a more scalable infrastructure, highlighted by innovations such as proto-danksharding and, importantly, \u201cblobs\u201d for more efficient data handling and notably lower transaction costs. These advancements mark a transition from laying down the network\u2019s foundational framework to enhancing and broadening its capabilities. Developers will now work to scale from a solid baseline (one) to new, undefined heights (represented as N; an indefinite, but foreseeably large number).\n\nRead more: What does EIP 4844 mean for Ethereum rollups?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live on Ethereum on March 13. It featured EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which introduced \u201cblob\u201d transactions or sharded data. These transactions are designed to place data into \u201cblobs\u201d and guarantee data availability, subsequently reducing transaction costs on rollups.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, Buterin notes that important scaling work still needs to be done, like improving rollups\u2019 ability to optimize each blob, though the fundamental problems around scaling have already been addressed.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has been slowly shifting from becoming a layer-1 ecosystem to a layer-2-centric ecosystem, with many applications moving towards building on layer-2s.\n\nWith this in mind, Buterin remarks that the next stage of Ethereum development will likely focus on bringing data availability sampling (DAS) to life, specifically PeerDAS.\n\nPeerDAS is designed to reuse battle-tested peer-to-peer components to enhance Ethereum data availability scaling beyond EIP-4844 while minimizing the amount of work that honest nodes need to do.\n\nRead more: Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won\u2019t scale blockchains alone\n\n\u201cIn PeerDAS, each node stores a significant fraction (e.g. 1/8) of all blob data, and nodes maintain connections to many peers in the p2p network. When a node needs to sample for a particular piece of data, it asks one of the peers that it knows is responsible for storing that piece,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nUsing PeerDAS, more solo stakers can also participate in securing the network. They can download 1/8th of the data instead of a full blob, which helps decentralize the network.\n\nBesides DAS, Buterin also highlights four key areas of improvement for layer-2s. First, he notes that layer-2s can explore data compression techniques to decrease byte size for transactions. Secondly, it is worthwhile exploring Plasma as a technique, which will mean that data is only posted on layer-1s in exceptional circumstances.\n\nRead more: What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again?\n\nAdditionally, he remarks that layer-2s should investigate improving execution-related constraints and security as well as code reliability, noting that existing ecosystem standards are too lenient.\n\n\u201cEthereum is no longer just a financial ecosystem. It\u2019s a full-stack replacement for large parts of \u2018centralized tech,\u2019 and even provides some things that centralized tech does not. And we need to build with this broader ecosystem in mind,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a catalyst for Bitcoin. They brought in billions of dollars and helped propel Bitcoin to new highs before its upcoming halving. These ETFs were the first of their kind, allowing equity investors to gain direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. Their approval has sparked significant discussions revolving around spot ETFs of some of the other top tokens, with Ethereum ETFs at the forefront.\n\nThe second-largest token by market cap, Ethereum focuses on providing a platform for and access to decentralized finance (DeFi). The blockchain hosts some of the top projects in crypto, ranging from AI tokens to meme coins and everything in between.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nAbout 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nTalks of an Ethereum ETF have been heating up. While applications were submitted throughout 2023, Bitcoin ETFs overshadowed them in discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). With Bitcoin ETFs released, regulators and potential sponsors are ramping up ETH ETF discussions.\n\nMost analysts believe that Ethereum ETFs will be approved because Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent and demand from investors exists. Ethereum ETFs are more a question of when rather than if.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has unique characteristics that could make it a great fit for investors. Specifically, Ethereum's consensus mechanism allows users to stake tokens in exchange for fees. In practice, it works similarly to stock lending, which can allow you to earn extra cash on assets you are holding.\n\n\"The world of investors who are looking for cash-producing assets is massive and ETH obviously generates fees that go to the token holders,\" said VanEck Portfolio Manager Pranav Kanade.\n\nVanEck is one of the companies that released a Bitcoin ETF in January and has applied for an Ethereum ETF. Kanade added that \"from a market perspective, part of me believes that the market size for a spot ETH ETF is potentially as big if not bigger than the spot Bitcoin ETFs,\" showing that he is confident in ETH's ability to attract investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful ETFs in history, attracting more investment than any other ETF in its first months of launch.\n\nMarkets seem to agree with Kanade. Ethereum is up over 100% in the past six months. Additionally, tokens that focus on staking, which is one of the major appealing aspects of ETH, have seen solid price increases recently: Avalanche (AVAX) is up nearly 500% in the past six months, and EigenLayer has attracted more than $11 billion in investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have shown interest in staking outside of Ethereum and for Ethereum in general. Spot Ethereum ETFs would combine the two, potentially creating an ETF sector larger than that of Bitcoin.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Asset Manager Says Ethereum ETFs Could Be Even Bigger Than Bitcoin ETFs: Where Investors Are Placing Their Bets originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

The proposed product intends to provide direct exposure to the value of the largest altcoin held by the Trust with Coinbase Custody.\n\nAfter submitting its new spot Ethereum ETF filing, Bitwise also published its correlation analysis to urge the SEC to approve the product:\n\n\"We believe the results show strong correlation between the ETH spot market and CME ETH futures market, at a level substantially similar to the findings of the SEC\u2019s analysis in the spot bitcoin ETF approval order,\" the asset manager said.\n\nLast October, the investment manager launched an ETF tied to Ethereum futures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, multiple major players, including BlackRock and Fidelity, filed for spot Ethereum ETFs. This came after the SEC greenlit a slew of Bitcoin ETFs in early January to much fanfare.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, the SEC appears to be determined to classify the second-largest cryptocurrency as a security.\n\nThis might complicate the approval of multiple spot ETF applications.

        "title": "Litecoin Price Spikes After CFTC Calls It Commodity Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMeme coin lovers may be having a great month, but Litecoin (LTC) hodlers are celebrating today with their coin taking the spot as the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100, with a bullish performance in the last 24 hours that saw its price spike nearly 11%.\n\nThis comes on the fifth day of relatively slow markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum correcting by less than 2% in the same period. The global cryptocurrency market cap today sits at $2.79 trillion, marking a mere -0.1% change in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe most significant non-technical event contributing to Litecoin's spike is a recent statement by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, the CFTC declared Litecoin a commodity. This statement is crucial as it places Litecoin outside the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities and imposes stricter responsibilities on coin issuers.\n\n\u201cKuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC),\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeing declared a commodity potentially opens the door for more comfortable endorsements and further integrations for Litecoin, with less fear of the SEC attempting enforcement actions.\n\nLitecoin started the day at $94.80 and traded sideways until 6am UTC, when bulls took over the markets and spiked the coin to its daily high of $106 before correcting slightly to its current mark of $104.99. The coin is up 11.56% in the last 24 hours and 21.71% in the last week, plus 27.5% in the last 30 days. Friday marks the second best performing day of the year for LTC, only behind an 18.7% spike on March 11.\n\nOn the technical side, Litecoin was trading sideways during January and February, bouncing in a horizontal channel between $63 and $77. The coin broke its channel on February 29 and started a bullish trend on March 1. Most of the positive performance registered in 2024 has been due to March's positive results. Since the bottom of the channel to today's high, there has been a roughly 63% spike.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nPast data shows that many of the unusually large candlesticks are followed by a correction of many small-bodied candlesticks in the days after. Litecoin failed to break past the resistance set by March 11's spike, which could point to a possible cup-and-handle pattern: A big spike followed by a symmetrical period of a correction, and a recovery that cancels all the losses almost in a semi-circle shape. If this is the case, there should be a smaller correction followed by a similar recovery before a bullish breakout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, the coin looks bullish and healthy in a longer timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the coin is slightly overbought with a 66% dominance of bulls over bears, with Litecoin proving its bullishness after bouncing from its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 55 and going back again to trade on top of the EMA 10.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nGiven that the coin is bullish in charts set at 24 hour candlesticks and in weekly candlesticks for the first time since June of 2023, an immediate resistance could be around $115 for a 10% gain. If it remains strongly bullish, the next one appears to be near $135 for a nearly 29% gain. However, if it fails to meet expectations and corrects down, it could drop somewhere near the $80 price line for a -22.5% loss.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

He stated that for a while now, people have known that Ethereum needs to get better at handling large number of transactions. One way to do this was through rollups.\n\nHe mentioned that the Ethereum team needs to make rollups better in four ways: making data smaller, using new ways to check data, fixing problems with how transactions are done, and making everything more secure.\n\nHe stated that Ethereum is on the right track with these changes. But Buterin also mentioned that future changes won\u2019t be as big as the ones that have been executed recently.\n\nTrouble ahead\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,519.87 and its price had fallen by 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent positive price movement showcased by the ETH, the overall network growth plummeted for ETH.\n\nThis indicated that new addresses had lost interest in ETH at the time of writing.\n\nThe decline in network growth suggested that the new addresses were not willing to acquire ETH at current price levels and may be waiting for a correction before accumulating.\n\nAnother troubling indicator for ETH was the waning interest shown by whales. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the number of addresses holding 1-1000 ETH had fallen.\n\nIf whales continue to sell their holdings, it could prove to be detrimental to ETH\u2019s price.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin pushes for anti-correlation incentives in Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Such a system could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller players.\n\nVitalik Buterin writing a proposal to improve decentralization for Ethereum.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a new framework to incentivize Ethereum decentralization by penalizing correlated failures among validators.\n\nAccording to the research proposal submitted by Buterin, large-scale staking groups, and organizations have an undue advantage over smaller players, creating an imbalance in the decentralized staking sector.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that if you are a single large actor, any mistakes that you make would be more likely to be replicated across all \u201cidentities\u201d that you control, even if you split your coins up among many nominally-separate accounts,\u201d the Ethereum co-founder said.\n\nButerin suggests that validators controlled by the same entity should receive a higher penalty if they fail together, compared to failing independently. The theory behind this approach is that mistakes made by a single large actor are more likely to be replicated across all the \u201cidentities\u201d they control.\n\nStaking pools and liquid staking services such as Lido remain popular among users, given how their platform allows for the participation of more stakers due to the lower amount of entry (in ETH). To date, Lido currently has an estimated $34 billion worth of ETH staked, representing around 30% of the total supply. Advocates and developers pushing for Ethereum decentralization have previously cautioned against Lido\u2019s dominance and the potential for \u201ccartelization,\u201d where outsized profits can be extracted compared to non-pooled capital.\n\nButerin\u2019s analysis of recent attestation data revealed that validators within the same cluster, such as a staking pool, are more likely to experience correlated failures, likely due to shared infrastructure. To address this issue, he proposed penalizing validators proportionally to the deviation from the average failure rate. If many validators fail in a given slot, the penalty for each failure would be higher.\n\nBased on simulations of this scenario, such a system could reduce the advantage of large Ethereum stakers over smaller ones, as large entities are more likely to cause spikes in the failure rate due to correlated failures.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s potential benefits include incentivizing Ethereum decentralization by encouraging separate infrastructure for each validator and making solo staking more economically competitive relative to staking pools. Buterin notes that other options could be subjected to further analysis. This includes variations on the penalty schemes in order to minimize the average \u201cbig\u201d validator\u2019s advantage over smaller validators.\n\nAccording to Buterin, it\u2019s also worth examining the impact of such a framework in terms of geographic and client decentralization. However, he did not mention the possibility of reducing the solo staking amount from the current 32 Ether (ETH) or approximately $111,000 based on Ether\u2019s current price at roughly $3,500."

Not even the recent Bitwise ETH ETF filing and correlation analysis has swayed the analyst\u2019s position.\n\nOn 28th March, Bitwise submitted a new 19b-4 form alongside a correlation analysis to satisfy SEC\u2019s criteria, as seen during the spot Bitcoin BTC ETF application.\n\nThe firm stated;\n\n\u201cThis is the first ETH correlation analysis to replicate the specific methodology used by the SEC in their evaluation of bitcoin, and the results are encouraging.\u201d\n\nGreat correlation, but ETH ETF odds are still low\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer of Variant Fund, hailed the correlation analysis;\n\n\u201cFantastic work from Bitwise here, showing an extraordinarily tight correlation between ETH spot and futures, using the SEC\u2019s methodology.\n\nChervinsky added that Bitwise analysis could make it hard for the SEC to deny ETH ETF based on correlation.\n\nBut Nate Geraci of ETF Stores took a swipe at SEC;\n\n\u201cSad we need an ETF issuer to run correlation analysis showing that govt agency approved futures contracts tightly track price of underlying asset\u2026 And a sister govt agency has approved ETFs holding said futures but won\u2019t approve ETFs holding underlying.\u201d\n\nIn rejoinder, however, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the developments don\u2019t improve approval odds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 7 weeks till the deadline, and radio silence from SEC = bleak\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Balchunas noted that if there is a rejection in May, the timeline might have to be re-adjusted to the US elections.\n\n\u201cElection next. Then see what landscape looks like.\u201d\n\nThat means investors vested in spot ETH ETF approval may need to wait longer if the May deadline doesn\u2019t hold."

        "content": "Despite having little to no purpose, some memecoins have valuations in the billions.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin suggested tying them to charity or finding other ways to tap taders' desire for fun and profit.\n\nEvery day, crypto traders swap billions of dollars of memecoins \u2014 defiantly useless tokens with tickers that often point to internet memes like Pepe the Frog.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks there\u2019s a better way.\n\nMemecoin creators should set aside a large chunk of tokens for charitable causes \u2014 or, better yet, create crypto-based video games designed to help low-income players, he said on his blog Friday.\n\n\u201cI have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1,\u201d he wrote, referencing a rash of offensive memecoins on the Solana blockchain.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I value people\u2019s desire to have fun, and I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\u201d\n\nMemecoin mania\n\nDogecoin is the original meme coin. It was made as a joke in 2015, poking fun at the speculative frenzy that often overtook the crypto economy.\n\nIt was not meant to be digital cash or digital gold, a la bitcoin. It did not represent governance rights in a digital cooperative, like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB. It had no built-in yield, no peg to some other stable asset.\n\nBut Dogecoin\u2019s market capitalisation surged to more than $88 billion during the 2021 bull market. And paved the way for other similarly silly, useless tokens.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLast year, PEPE took Ethereum by storm. This year, Dogwifhat surged on Solana. Both now have market capitalizations above $3 billion.\n\nMost have no intrinsic value, and their values are determined entirely by hype and an investors\u2019 gain (or loss) by the timing of his or her exit.\n\nMemecoins have accounted for roughly 5% of Ethereum transaction fees over the past month, according to data gathered by data analyst James Tolan.\n\nAnd they have made up a similar percent of trade volume on Ethereum\u2019s decentralised exchanges, according to SixDegree Lab.\n\nOn Thursday, meme coin trade volume topped $113 million on Ethereum.\n\nPositive-sum tokens\n\n\u201cIf people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version of this whole concept?\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHis first idea is rather straightforward: some percent of a newly-issued memecoin, or the transaction fees it generates, should be set aside for charity.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the most successful example of this might be Dogelon Mars, an Elon Musk-themed token.\n\nIn 2021, he transferred $145 million worth of Dogelon to the Methuselah Foundation, a space travel and anti-aging nonprofit dedicated to \u201cmaking 90 the new 50,\u201d according to its website.\n\nIt was 43% of Dogelon\u2019s circulating supply, spurring panic among other investors, who feared a fire sale that would destroy the token\u2019s value. But the nonprofit promised to be a good steward of the token.\n\n\u201cWe will take the same nurturing approach with our Dogelon Mars holdings because we understand that the cryptocurrency\u2019s value depends on maintaining the public\u2019s confidence and capturing its imagination, much like baseball cards or other collectibles,\u201d David Gobel, the foundation\u2019s co-founder and CEO said in a statement at the time.\n\n\u201cWe want the $ELON to keep accruing value over the long term.\u201d\n\nLater that year, Dogelon holders voted to fund a Methuselah-led experiment.\n\n\u201cThe community has donated funds to send prize-winning vascular tissue science to the International Space Station (ISS), where experiments can continue beyond Earth\u2019s gravity,\u201d the nonprofit said on its blog.\n\n\u201cThe ability to grow human organs will be important for crews who will eventually be involved in deep-space travel.\u201d\n\nWhile the token\u2019s value has cratered since the heady days of 2021, Vitalik believes the foundation has made good on its promise.\n\n\u201cThe two Methuselah Foundation and the Dogelon Mars community seemed to develop a positive-sum relationship with each other, retroactively converting $ELON into a charity coin,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nOther charity-related coins have been less successful.\n\nGiveWell Inu \u2014 named after a Shiba Inu, like most dog-themed memecoins \u2014 donated its proceeds to GiveWell, Buterin noted. But it\u2019s borderline defunct, with only one or two transfers a day, on average.\n\nVideogames\n\nButerin is more optimistic about the impact of crypto-based video games.\n\nWhile some have criticised the so-called play-to-earn model employed by crypto-based games such as Axie Infinity, Buterin hopes to see \u201cRobin Hood games\u201d \u2014 new crypto-based games designed to benefit low-income players.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to satisfy people\u2019s desire to have fun, we should be making not simple copy-paste coins but rather more complicated and interesting games,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMoreover, \u201cgames that leave lower-income players in particular economically better off are more likely to leave their communities better than they came in.\u201d\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has praised Worldcoin\u2019s effort to enhance data privacy amid recent global regulatory challenges.\n\nIn a March 29 post on social media platform X, Buterin acknowledged Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to addressing privacy concerns by significantly reducing the data required in its system.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201c[Worldcoin] actually has been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing.\u201d\n\nNotably, Buterin was one of the earliest critics of the project when it launched last year. At the time, the Ethereum co-founder identified several flaws with the project\u2019s design, including the risk of data leaks and the collection of sensitive information such as gender, ethnicity, and health conditions.\n\nSince then, the Sam Altman-related project has faced several privacy-related controversies in various jurisdictions. Recently, regulatory authorities in Portugal and Spain imposed a temporary ban on Worldcoin\u2019s data collection activities for three months due to concerns over inadequate disclosure and unauthorized data collection from minors.\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s transparency and security\n\nAlex Blania, Worldcoin\u2019s co-founder, revealed that the crypto project has made significant strides in the transparency and security of its technology.\n\nBlania, in a March 28 post on X, detailed how the firm has made its ORB technology\u2019s core software components open-source while introducing new features that give people control over how their data is used.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cAdditional steps have been taken to ensure only individuals over the age of 18 are able to verify at an Orb. This includes redundant age confirmations in the app, verbal confirmation from Operators, and signage at locations. More technical solutions will follow.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Blania pointed out Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to collaborating with regulators to drive advancements across its operations. He remarked:\n\n\u201cWorldcoin is already the most private, open, and secure system of its kind and has never been more important.\u201d\n\nThese developments have translated into an increasing user base for the project, as nearly 5 million people across 120 countries have registered on its platform.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum News: Navigating The Latest Developments In The Ethereum Ecosystem - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, with each day bringing fresh developments that promise to enhance its functionality, security, and scalability. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has always been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, especially with its transition to Ethereum 2.0, aimed at addressing some of the network\u2019s longstanding challenges. The latest Ethereum news encompasses a broad spectrum of updates, from technical upgrades to strategic partnerships, all of which are crucial for both developers and investors within the crypto community.\n\nTechnical Upgrades and Ethereum 2.0\n\nOne of the most anticipated pieces of Ethereum news is the progress of Ethereum 2.0, especially the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition is expected to drastically reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption, making Ethereum a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain. Furthermore, the introduction of sharding as part of Ethereum 2.0 aims to significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability by splitting the database to spread the load, potentially solving the high gas fees and slow transaction times that have plagued the network during periods of high demand.\n\nStrategic Partnerships for Broader Adoption\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap is not solely focused on technical upgrades. Strategic partnerships play a vital role in its ecosystem expansion. Recent Ethereum news features collaborations with major companies and industries, aiming to integrate Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology into various sectors such as finance, supply chain management, and entertainment. These partnerships not only validate Ethereum\u2019s utility beyond mere cryptocurrency transactions but also pave the way for broader adoption of its technology.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT Boom on Ethereum\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors have seen explosive growth on the Ethereum network. Ethereum news frequently covers the launch of innovative DeFi projects and platforms that offer a wide range of financial services without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Similarly, the NFT market has thrived on Ethereum, with artists, creators, and collectors engaging in the purchase, sale, and trading of digital assets verified on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. This boom has significantly increased Ethereum\u2019s visibility and utility, attracting even more developers and investors to its ecosystem.\n\nThe Impact on Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nEthereum news often correlates with fluctuations in its price. Announcements related to upgrades, partnerships, or new project launches can have immediate effects on Ethereum\u2019s market value. Investors closely follow Ethereum news to gauge market sentiment and make informed decisions. With the ongoing developments in Ethereum 2.0 and increasing adoption in various sectors, many analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term price outlook.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, its community eagerly anticipates further news and updates that will shape its future. The transition to Ethereum 2.0, coupled with increasing adoption and innovative applications, positions Ethereum as a leading blockchain platform that could redefine how we think about digital transactions, contracts, and asset ownership. For developers, investors, and users alike, staying informed with the latest Ethereum news is essential for navigating the opportunities and challenges in the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum stands at the brink of significant transformation. Its commitment to innovation, sustainability, and broad adoption continues to drive interest and enthusiasm across the crypto space. As we look to the future, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives are set to further cement its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, promising a more efficient, secure, and accessible digital future."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH-USD) Surpasses One Million Validators with $114B Staked - TipRanks",
        "content": "The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH-USD), reached a pivotal milestone by surpassing one million validators and securing approximately 32 million Ether, valued at around $114 billion. The amount of Ether staked represents roughly 26% of the total Ether supply. By monitoring and validating transactions, the validators are the linchpins in protecting Ethereum against threats like double-spending.\n\nLido (LIDO-USD) is the single largest validator on Ethereum\u2019s network, accounting for 30% of the staked Ether. Lido\u2019s service democratizes the staking process, enabling those with smaller amounts of Ether to participate collectively. While the expanding validator base is generally seen as a boon for network security, concerns have been raised about potential challenges associated with managing many validators.\n\nValidator Concerns and Solutions\n\nThere are rising concerns over the possibility of having too much staked Ether and a probable increase in failed transactions due to an overabundance of validators. Despite these worries, solutions have been proposed to address the network\u2019s efficiency and decentralization. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently outlined a penalty mechanism to balance the scale between large and small ETH stakes by penalizing validators based on their failure rates.\n\nThe regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the SEC delaying decisions on Ether ETFs from financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity until May 2024. Despite the optimistic case for Ether ETFs, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement on Ethereum specifics has led to a more cautious stance regarding immediate approvals.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Technical Analysis\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, Ethereum\u2019s current indicators give a mixed outlook. The weekly Moving Averages Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a Selling stance, while the significant disparity between Ethereum\u2019s price and its exponential moving averages points toward Buying signals. However, because the gap between ETH\u2019s price and the EMAs is so large, and momentum has slowed as it moves higher, there are concerns that a deeper retracement may occur.\n\nDon\u2019t let crypto give you a run for your money.

        "title": "Ethereum nears 1 million active validators as network surge strengthens security - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The Ethereum network has witnessed a surge in validator numbers, with the count nearing one million.\n\nOn-chain data from Beacon Chain and Ethereum\u2019s Validator Queue show an active validator count of 979,686. However, a Dune Analytics dashboard curated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby places the total number on the network above the one million mark.\n\nThese validators have collectively staked 31.36 million ETH, constituting approximately 26% of the digital asset\u2019s total supply.\n\nNotably, according to Nansen data, most of these validators staked their assets through the liquid staking platform Lido, which accounts for around 30% of the staked ETH.\n\nEthereum validators play a critical role in maintaining the network\u2019s security through its proof-of-stake mechanism. To participate, they stake a minimum of 32 ETH and, in return, are rewarded with a portion of ETH.\n\nConsequently, an increasing number of validators signifies a bolstered network and reflects the blockchain\u2019s enhanced security.\n\nMeanwhile, this milestone is particularly significant amid a surge in validator interest, evidenced by a growing queue of over 10,000 validators awaiting network entry\u2014the highest seen this year. This waitlist represents over 320,000 ETH, equivalent to $1.1 billion, and is anticipated to clear within the next seven days.\n\nDecentralized staking\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, recently put forth a proposal aimed at improving the network\u2019s staking mechanism.\n\nIn his blog post, Buterin outlined a plan to impose penalties on validators in proportion to their average failure rates. This move addresses the inherent advantage larger ETH stakes possess over smaller ones.\n\nAdditionally, Buterin recommended stricter penalties for failures occurring simultaneously among several validators controlled by one entity.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201cOne tactic for incentivizing better decentralization in a protocol is to penalize correlations. That is, if one actor misbehaves (including accidentally), the penalty that they receive would be greater the more other actors (as measured by total ETH) misbehave at the same time as them.\u201d\n\nButerin argued that these measures would encourage larger entities to diversify their operations, thus lowering the likelihood of widespread network failures.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum\n\nFinancial services giant Fidelity Investments has pressed forward with its plans to offer an ETF based primarily on the price of ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, filing a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.\n\nFidelity said in the S-1 filing that its Ethereum Fund would \u201cseek to track the performance of ether,\u201d and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Fidelity did not mention the proposed fund\u2019s ticker or fee. The fund will hold ether and value its shares based on a Fidelity index based on price feeds from various spot markets, Fidelity said in the filing.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading just below $3,600, up 2% over the past 24 hours. It has risen more than 55% this year. Bitcoin, the no. 1 cryptocurrency, was recently trading over $71,000, up more than 60% year-to-date.\n\nInterest in cryptocurrency investments has skyrocketed this year following the SEC\u2019s early January approval of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs, which track bitcoin\u2019s price. Those new products have generated nearly $12 billion in net flows and hold over $57 billion in assets under management.\n\nIn spite of the widespread embrace of bitcoin ETFs, spot Ethereum ETFs have met resistance and investor appetite for them appears cool. Earlier this month, the SEC delayed making a decision on the spot Ethereum applications from Fidelity and BlackRock Inc., and started comments periods for the proposed products. Investors can currently purchase shares in Ethereum futures ETFs, which the SEC greenlit in October.\n\nSEC Requests Feedback on Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe agency requested public input on whether the arguments favoring spot bitcoin ETF approval would apply to the spot Ethereum ETFs, how they might differ from futures ether funds currently available, and if the proposed products would be vulnerable to manipulation. In the lengthy run-up to spot bitcoin ETF approval, the SEC voiced similar concerns about manipulation.\n\nBitwise Asset Management, Ark Invest, and Franklin Templeton are also seeking to create spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe SEC delay earlier this month was largely expected by analysts, who foresee May as the date to watch for the regulator to make a final decision on the funds.\n\n\u201cThe only date that matters for spot ethereum ETFs at this time is May 23,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter/X after Invesco\u2019s filing was punted in early February. May 23 is the final deadline for VanEck's spot ether fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a \"positive-sum\" vision for meme coins, arguing that the current crop of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies do little more than \"go up and down in price and contribute nothing of value in their wake.\"\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin argued that \"many people feel uneasy\" about the current crop of meme coins, and outlined how the \"financialized games\" that underpin them can be made to support public goods and charities.\n\nHe took aim at a recent wave of \"openly super-racist\" meme coins on blockchains such as Solana, adding that, \"I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin seemed to be referring to a rash of blatantly racist tokens that appeared on exchanges last week, many that used the n-word, a token called \"Jews did 9/11,\" and \"NAZI,\" which appears on exchanges with a swastika as its trading symbol.\n\n\"One answer to this conundrum is to shake our heads and virtue-signal about how much we are utterly abhorred by and stand against this stupidity,\" Buterin said. A more productive step, he argued, is to create a \"more positive-sum version\" of the whole concept of meme coins.\n\nButerin envisions meme coins being more like GiveWell Inu (which is no longer active), which promised to donate a portion of its proceeds to the Give Well organization.\n\nBack in 2021, after Buterin had been gifted half the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply he swapped them for Ethereum. After he'd done that, he sent $53 million worth of the ETH to Give Well. But the project seems to no longer be maintained.\n\nAnticipating that his ideas might steal the fun of degens who enjoy taking a gamble on new meme coins, he suggested that developers build better Web3 games. He specifically put the spotlight on the 0xPARC organization, which has been responsible for games Dark Forest and FrogCrypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I value people's desire to have fun,\" Buterin said, adding that, \"I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\"\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe cryptocurrency market saw a mixed performance early Wednesday, with Bitcoin and Ethereum remaining largely flat and all coins in the top 10 moving less than 3%\u2014except for the resurgent Dogecoin.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been trading sideways for the third day in a row after gaining a major bullish impulse in early 2024. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has gone up 2%, rising from $69,056 to its current price of $70,715.\n\nThe coin has been testing a resistance barrier at the $71,000 zone, which has kept prices on hold for the week. Every time Bitcoin broke that barrier during this week, prices corrected all the way back below $70,000. As a result, Bitcoin hasn't made any significant moves since surging on Monday.\n\nHowever, the body of today's daily candlestick appears to be filling what was all wicks in the previous days, meaning that Bitcoin could be heading towards a bullish breakout in the immediate future if prices don\u2019t retrace as they did in the last two days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which tries to estimate the market phase of a specific asset, shows that prices are not particularly bullish or bearish\u2014and hints to a possible a possible switch in the trend, meaning the coin could correct in the upcoming days if today's candlestick fails to remain bullish and break past the $71,500. If that is the case, the strongest support is set at around $64,000.\n\nThere is still a bullish trend in play, especially considering other indicators and a longer time frame. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 61 shows that 61% of all traders are buying BTC. Although the indicator shows some bullish dominance, it doesn\u2019t mean that the coin is overbought. An RSI at this point shows that there could be still room to grow on a medium-term basis before buyers plan to realize their gains.\n\nThe gap between the EMA 10 and the EMA 55\u2014the average prices of the last 10 and 55 days, respectively\u2014stopped closing and is now somewhat in parallel, showing that there is still a bullish trend in play. However, the markets are still recovering from the past correction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is also flat, following Bitcoin's lead. The price of ETH has gone up less than 1% from $3,527 to $3,557 in the last 24 hours. This rise cancels the losses of yesterday's candlestick, but marks the fourth day of Ethereum trading sideways with prices swinging between $3,450 and $3,670.\n\nThe coin still has the bearish correction heavily influencing its price behavior. For almost two weeks, the token was trading below its median price of the last 10 days, so the ADX at 35 shows that there is still a bearish presence in the price performance for the immediate future.\n\nOn longer time frames, however, the coin looks bullish. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows that there is a switch in the market cycle, and the coin is just starting its bullish upswing. This is a breath of fresh air for traders, especially considering that the coin appears to have finally broken past the resistance set by the EMA10 and is trading back above it, which is considered really bullish.\n\nSmaller coins surge\n\nHowever, other tokens in the crypto realm are beating the market's malaise and have experienced major gains in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a Bitcoin fork born in 2017 to promote bigger blocks and discourage layer-2 solutions, has been the second-best performer among the top 20 coins with a more than 5% price jump in the last 24 hours. The coin is now slightly correcting, but it was up 13% as of earlier today, which made it the second-best performing coin of the top 100.\n\nToday, the price of BCH went from $541 to $570. The coin\u2019s movement is extremely bullish, trading well over its EMA10 (which is currently at about $485) all thanks to a massive 12% pump yesterday when it went from $477 to $541. Right now, all indicators look bullish for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nMeme coins are performing really well, too, with Dogecoin, BONK, and Floki Inu commanding the top 100 with gains of more than 12% each.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDogecoin jumped over the $0.20 mark late Wednesday for the first time since 2021 and has continued to rise since. It briefly popped over $0.22 earlier Thursday and is currently up 17% on the day at a price of $0.218. It's the largest gainer in the top 100 today.\n\nAlso notably, KuCoin's KCS token, which is recovering after the announcement of United States charges against the crypto exchange on Tuesday, is up 10.43% today. MakerDAO's MKR token, which spiked 11.81%, set a new ATH today at $3,549 to register its best-performing month ever.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nParallel Studios, the startup behind Ethereum NFT card-battler Parallel, announced late Wednesday that it has raised $35 million in fresh funding from a bevy of major firms around the crypto world and numerous well-known angel investors.\n\nThe list includes investment management giant VanEck, Solana Ventures, the Base Ecosystem Fund, Collab + Currency, and The Spartan Group, while the list of angels features Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Pudgy Penguins owner and CEO Luca Netz, and Yield Guild Games co-founder Gabby Dizon, among others.\n\nParallel previously raised $50 million from Paradigm in 2021 at what the studio then said was a $500 million valuation. The company did not disclose an updated valuation or the format of the latest funding round.\n\nHowever, Parallel Studios did share some details with Decrypt\u2019s GG on how it plans to utilize the $35 million infusion, along with more clarity on what\u2019s ahead not only for Parallel\u2014GG\u2019s 2023 game of the year\u2014but also the recently unveiled AI-powered Colony game that it\u2019s building on Solana.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$\ud835\udfef\ud835\udff1\ud835\udde0 \ud835\uddd9\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00 We are excited to announce our latest funding round! Our team is thrilled to expand the Parallel universe across new mediums and platforms. // pic.twitter.com/ZJLyFoahjH \u2014 Parallel (@ParallelTCG) March 28, 2024\n\nThe fundraise comes just weeks after Parallel opened up to the public in a free-to-play beta. A studio representative said that Parallel Studios aims to \u201cstart onboarding a ton more users\u201d by expanding its recent Parallel Ambassadors program and working more with influencers broadly, as well as through paid advertising in various markets worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, they aim to roll out some significant moves in the coming months, including launches on the Epic Games Store and Steam, and the impending in-game launch of the Planetfall expansion. They said that mobile versions are also on the roadmap and that it\u2019s a \u201ckey area of interest,\u201d but that no timeline has been finalized there.\n\nThe rep added that Parallel is already seeing 10 times the website signups recently than in January before the open beta debuted and that it just had its best-ever tally for daily active users. The team says it plans to share such data more openly in the near future once it can better validate the measured stats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the studio\u2019s other major focus, Colony. After plenty of teases, Parallel Studios recently launched an extensive whitepaper detailing the generative AI powered \u201csurvival simulation\u201d game, which will utilize the Solana blockchain\u2014instead of Ethereum and scaling network Base, as seen with Parallel.\n\nAs noted above, Solana Ventures took part in the latest funding round, and two of the network\u2019s prominent co-founders were counted among the backers too.\n\nParallel Studios aims to get a beta version out to the public by the end of the year, echoing the target noted in the whitepaper. Funding will also help further development on Wayfinder, the on-chain AI protocol that will power Colony and potential other apps and games ahead.\n\n\u201cWayfinder is a new artificial intelligence (AI) focused omni-chain tool enabling user-owned, autonomous AI agents to securely and efficiently navigate within and across blockchain ecosystems and applications while independently transacting assets they control via dedicated Web3 wallets,\u201d the protocol whitepaper reads.\n\nA pre-alpha version of Colony has already been tested, but the studio says that it will utilize investment funds to help ramp up the development of the game and launch additional tests beginning this summer. The representative said that Parallel Studios is \u201cmoving very, very quickly to hire more people on the Colony side\u201d to reach those goals.\n\nPRIME, the Ethereum-based token of Parallel that will also be bridged to Solana for use in Colony, is up 12% over the last day to a current price of about $23.30 since the funding news was announced. The token has been on a hot streak lately, up 63% over the last 30 days. It set a new all-time high price of $28.00 on March 18 following the latest Colony reveal.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Eyes on the price of BTC and ETH: in less than 21 hours, options contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum worth 15 billion dollars will expire.\n\nThe price of the cryptographic king and queen could experience extreme volatility, as traders aim to keep BTC at $70,000 and ETH at $3,500.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nTomorrow 15 billion Deribit options on the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets will expire: what will be the impact on the price?\n\nWe all know by now that the cryptocurrency market reacts more or less hysterically based on certain events of a temporal nature: one of these is the expiration, scheduled for tomorrow, of options on Bitcoin and Ethereum for 15.2 billion dollars.\n\nAs we can see within the derivatives trading platform Deribit, on March 29th contracts on BTC and ETH worth respectively 9.5 billion dollars and 5.7 billion dollars will expire, with the price of both coins potentially experiencing a rollercoaster situation.\n\nWe remind you that Deribit represents the largest cryptocurrency options platform in the world, with an 85% market share, followed by Binance, Okx, and Bybit.\n\nThis is a deadline that will lead to the expiration of 40% of the total notional open interest of Bitcoin and 43% of that of Ethereum, with a probably decisive impact on the short-term price action of the two assets.\n\nAs experts point out, like Luuk Strijers from Deribit, many of these options are destined to expire \u201cIn The Money\u201d (ITM), meaning with profits in favor of traders who have benefited from the rise in prices of the entire crypto market.\n\nThis could lead to a strong price increase for the two cryptos, with extreme volatility on the horizon.\n\nThese are his words in a recent interview with Coindesk:\n\n\u201cThese levels are higher than usual, which can also be seen in the lower maximum levels of pain. The reason is, of course, the recent price increase. Higher levels of ITM expirations could lead to potential upward pressure or volatility in the underlying.\u201d\n\nTraders\u2019 confidence in the price movement of the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, as highlighted by Strijers, is justified by the low level of \u201cmax pain price\u201d which is respectively at 51,000 USD for BTC and 2,600 USD for ETH.\n\nUsually institutional traders seek to bring the price of an underlying asset as close as possible to this level, with the aim of inflicting the maximum loss on call option buyers. However, in this case, it seems that buyers are destined to close their positions at a profit, triggering a possible rally.\n\nAttention to possible spikes in the area of 70,000 USD for BTC and 3,500 USD for ETH, as we approach the deadline, flash incursions around these levels will become more and more likely.\n\nAccording to David Brickell, head of international distribution at the Toronto-based cryptocurrency platform FRNT Financial, the cause can be found in the positioning of coverage by several dealers, short of 50 million dollars of Gamma while most orders are concentrated around the identified price ranges.\n\nFasten your seat belts, and avoid opening high leverage futures positions, given the high probability of being liquidated by an unpredictable market move.\n\nAlso pay attention to the date of April 5th for Ethereum, because on that occasion options with a relatively low open interest will expire, but with a notional value of calls higher than the current one (expiration on March 29th) and with a max pain price equal to 3,500 USD.\n\nFor Bitcoin the next date to watch is April 26, with another $5 billion in expiring positions.\n\nAnalysis of the price of crypto BTC and ETH\n\nWhile options traders are in fibrillation for the expiration of a flood of contracts, Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to maintain their price within a bullish structure.\n\nIn detail on BTC, after yesterday\u2019s afternoon movement in which the shorts went to take the liquidity set just below the $72,000 level, long traders have returned to the scene, bringing the asset\u2019s prices above the pre-dump price.\n\nIn the 4h chart we can clearly see how the crypto n\u00b01 for market capitalization is holding well above the EMA 50, recovering from a brief dip in the previous days.\n\nIndicatively, the price zones to keep under control are $71,500 USD, as if broken, it could accelerate volatility to the upside, and $68,000 USD, below which we could go hunting for a \u201cV shape recovery\u201d pattern or for immediate liquidity absorption.\n\nIt could be a good idea to place a purchase order down there, assuming a temporary crash and a subsequent recovery.\n\nIf there is a break to the upside instead, let\u2019s expect a quick reach of 74,000 USD:\n\nFor Ethereum the situation is similar but with a more downward/sideways trend.\n\nETH prices are also above the EMA 50 on the 4h chart, but they have not yet recovered from yesterday\u2019s short dump.\n\nThe selling pressure, triggered by the negativity inflicted by the SEC\u2019s decision delay on an ether spot ETF, could still be felt for a while as options traders await tomorrow\u2019s expiration.\n\nPay attention to the level of 3,500 USD which is crucial to protect in order to fuel the hopes of the bulls to see the crypto above 4,000 USD in the short term.\n\nFor an immediate restart, the first goal is the break of 3,650 USD, which would open the doors to a phase of violent price increase.\n\nIf there is a decline, let\u2019s prepare to see the currency below 3,300 USD, and possibly even close to 3,100 USD.\n\nThe strategy of placing a purchase order at these levels (generally -10% from current values) remains valid even in this case, trying to take advantage of market volatility."

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nFollowing the SEC approval of some spot Bitcoin ETFs, many entities have also indicated interest in an ETH ETF. The Boston-based multinational financial company Fidelity Investments joined the race for approval to list a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWhile advancing its plans, the company has filed an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).\n\nFidelity Submits Its S-1 Form For A Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nAs the race for spot Ethereum ETFs intensifies, an X post from Radar revealed that the $4.5 trillion asset manager, Fidelity Investments, is the newest applicant for an ETH ETF approval.\n\nJUST IN: $4.5 trillion asset manager Fidelity filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF with staking included. US regulator SEC has been reluctant to approve Ethereum ETFs and is unlikely to change unless challenged in court. pic.twitter.com/bdQwCgm1Pf \u2014 Radar\ud83d\udea8 (@RadarHits) March 27, 2024\n\nRecently, Fidelity filed the S-1 form with the SEC, indicating its intention to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe filing shows that Fidelity selected the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) as the market for trading the ETH ETF upon approval. However, it didn\u2019t specify the expected fees for the ETF or the ticker name under which it will trade.\n\nNotably, Fidelity is not the only company that has filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF. Other prominent entities like BlackRock, Grayscale, Valkyrie Digital Assets, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree Investments are already in the race.\n\nThe quest for spot Ethereum ETFs started following the SEC\u2019s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs have recorded impressive performances in the weeks following the approval. According to Coinglass data, the BTC ETFs have amassed $57.9 billion in total AUM as of March 28.\n\nFidelity Includes ETH Staking In Its Application For Ethereum ETF\n\nFidelity Investment took its application further by including an ETH staking program. This means the asset manager proposes to stake a portion of its trust\u2019s assets using one or more staking infrastructure providers.\n\nA part of the application reads:\n\n\u201cAs a result of any staking activity in which the trust may engage, the trust expects to receive certain staking rewards of Ether, which may be treated for federal income tax purposes as income to the trust.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the filing indicated that the Fidelity Digital Asset Service, the fund custodian, will maintain complete control of the staked ether. It will always have exclusive possession and control of the private keys of the staked tokens.\n\nHowever, the possibility of getting spot Ethereum ETFs is relatively low. The SEC has reportedly opened investigations into several entities with a relationship with the Ethereum Foundation. The aim centers on classifying ETH as a security.\n\nMoreover, some industry experts believe the SEC will implement delay strategies similar to the approval process of spot BTC ETFs. According to Radar, the US SEC has delayed the Ethereum ETF approval and will likely remain adamant unless challenged.\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hougan thinks the SEC should delay its approval till December from the anticipated May dates. His argument revolves around establishing a better understanding of the spot BTC ETF within Wall Street before introducing that of ETH.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

This airdrop accounts for 5% of the total supply of 15 billion ENA tokens, and the quantity of tokens each user receives will be based on the number of shards they accumulate by April 1.\n\nTo qualify for the airdrop, users must ensure their USDe, the protocol's synthetic dollar that is pegged to the U.S. currency, is staked or held within the Ethena protocol. Eligible participants can expect to receive the ENA tokens on April 2, and these tokens will subsequently be available on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs).\n\nEthena Labs has successfully raised $20.5 million in funding over the past year through two funding rounds. Notable investors such as Galaxy Digital, OKX, Dragonfly, Binance Labs, and Bybit, among others, participated in these rounds, leading to a valuation of $300 million for the token maker.\n\nThis airdrop initiative follows the conclusion of the Ethena Shard Campaign, a six-week event that encouraged crypto enthusiasts to collect shards by actively participating in activities on the Ethena protocol. During the campaign, the supply of USDe reached a value of $1.3 billion, making it the fastest USD-denominated asset to surpass the $1 billion milestone, as reported by Ethena Labs."

        "content": "If XRP captures Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) market cap, its price could skyrocket to a new all-time high of $7.42, representing an impressive 11.8x rise.\n\nDespite its unique legal clarity, XRP has not performed as expected during the current bull run. The concerns among market participants began in late July 2023 when XRP started correcting the gains it picked up following the pivotal July 13, 2023 ruling.\n\nNotably, by September 2023, XRP had already retraced all its gains, collapsing from the $0.93 high. Despite the broader market\u2019s uptrend, which started in October 2023, XRP has not recorded any substantial price run, trailing other notable altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result, Ethereum, which XRP had aimed to overtake again as the second-largest crypto asset, has clinched a market capitalization far above XRP\u2019s. At the valuation of $406.64 billion, Ethereum\u2019s market cap has skyrocketed 119% from the $185.12 billion recorded last October.\n\nHowever, while XRP\u2019s market capitalization has also increased within this timeframe, its growth rate pales compared to Ethereum\u2019s. XRP currently boasts a valuation of $34.23 billion, marking a 32% increase from the $26 billion market cap in October 2023.\n\nXRP Price if It Captures Ethereum Market Cap\n\nDespite the underperformance, some market participants remain confident in XRP\u2019s potential. Interestingly, analysts have predicted that XRP will hit some lofty price positions. On March 19, top analyst EGRAG asserted that XRP could reach $27, citing historical data.\n\nIn addition, Reaper Financial CEO Patrick Riley revealed in an interview last December that he expects XRP to record a massive growth to $22. Amid these ambitious projections, we evaluated how much the XRP price needs to surge for the token to overtake Ethereum eventually.\n\nLeveraging an online resource, Marketcapof com, we discovered that XRP currently trades 0.08x under Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. As a result, XRP\u2019s valuation would need to increase by as much as 11.88x in order to reach Ethereum\u2019s market cap.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSupposing XRP\u2019s circulating supply remains relatively stable, XRP\u2019s price would need to rise to $7.42 for its market cap to reach the figure currently recorded by Ethereum.\n\nMarket watchers have previously forecasted XRP to hit the $7 price target. Prominent XRP influencer Ben Armstrong disclosed in January that believes XRP would certainly reach $7. Meanwhile, last month, analyst Ben McClymans set a $7 target for XRP during the bull run in 2025.\n\nFor XRP to reach the $7 target, its price would need to rally by 1,013% from the current figure of $0.6285. While this surge could face opposition at multiple junctures, analysts generally believe it is possible to attain."

The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit that is powering the Ethereum ecosystem, is reportedly under investigation.\n\n\"Very bullish\" on Bitcoin\n\nDuring the interview, Fink also said that he was \"very bullish\" on Bitcoin in the long term. He has admitted that the massive retail demand was unpredictable. As reported by U.Today, BlackRock's IBIT has shattered numerous records, becoming the fastest-growing ETF .\n\nAt the same time, Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, recently stated that there was little demand for Ethereum from their clients. Other altcoins see virtually no demand, according to Mitchnick. He has stated that Bitcoin remains the number one priority for the financial giant."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Mining and Renewable Energy: Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum Lead Sustainability - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, March 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency mining has long faced scrutiny for its excessive energy consumption and subsequent environmental impact. In 2022, The White House discovered that crypto assets accounted for 0.4% to 0.9% of the total annual global electricity consumption, exceeding the energy usage of some individual countries.\n\nHowever, a recent study published in the journal PNAS has proposed a partnership between cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen production, offering a potential avenue for accelerating the transition to cleaner energy while promoting broader adoption. In this article, we delve into the dynamics of Bitcoin and Ethereum mining, introduce BlockDAG Network mining, and explore how these projects' approach could contribute to democratizing the industry while supporting renewable energy initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study featured in PNAS underscores the synergistic potential between cryptocurrency mining and green hydrogen production, envisioning a scenario where profits from mining activities could be reinvested into clean hydrogen production and renewable energy businesses. This innovative solution involves utilizing crypto profits to drive the expansion of solar and wind energy indirectly through green hydrogen production.\n\nBitcoin:\n\nBitcoin, operating on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, traditionally relied on energy-intensive mining operations powered predominantly by fossil fuels. However, the PNAS study offers an optimistic outlook on Bitcoin's potential role in renewable energy expansion. It suggests a shift towards clean energy sources for Bitcoin mining, with energy companies or climate-focused groups undertaking mining activities instead of conventional individual miners. This shift aims to democratize the space, and ensures that earnings from mining are directed towards sustainable energy projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network:\n\nBlockDAG Network presents a distinct departure from traditional blockchain consensus methods, offering a novel approach to transaction processing. Unlike linear blockchains like Bitcoin, which arrange transactions in sequential blocks, BlockDAG employs a graph-like structure, facilitated by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), enabling parallel processing and enhanced scalability. With the introduction of its mining solution, BlockDAG Network seeks to usher in a new era of accessibility and democratization within the passive income generation industry.\n\nBy harnessing the unique attributes of DAGs, BlockDAG Network pioneers a system where mining is no longer confined to large-scale operations that are not energy-efficient but instead, users can seamlessly integrate the machines into everyday households. Unlike conventional blockchain networks relying on Proof of Work (PoW) mechanisms and intensive computational power, BlockDAG eliminates the need for expensive, specialized mining hardware. Instead, it adopts a more inclusive approach, allowing individuals to participate in the mining process using affordable mining rigs available for purchase on the website, priced at $1,500 or less. This accessibility empowers anyone with a computer or smartphone connected to the internet to initiate mining activities promptly thereby generating passive income.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough its innovative home mining solutions, BlockDAG Network democratizes access to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and enables individuals worldwide to actively engage in block creation and validation while reshaping the landscape of digital currencies for the financial benefit of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum:\n\nEthereum formerly operated on the same unsustainable proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism as Bitcoin. However, on September 15, 2022, Ethereum underwent a transition, replacing its PoW mechanism with an alternative known as proof-of-stake (PoS). The transition of Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake is known as the \"Merge\" and promised a drastic reduction in electricity consumption. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, projected that the transition to PoS would decrease global electricity usage by 0.2% and slash crypto carbon emissions by 99.992%. The Crypto Carbon Rating Institution reported a staggering 99.99% reduction in Ethereum's energy consumption and carbon footprint immediately after the Merge.\n\nThis change eliminated the network of energy-intensive mining devices that previously competed to create the next block for the underlying blockchain. Instead, wealth became a pivotal factor in the block creation process under PoS. Coins are staked as collateral, with the software randomly selecting a stakeholder to create the next block. Unlike PoW, where the chance of obtaining a reward depended on employing more energy-intensive devices, PoS incentivizes acquiring a higher stake to increase the odds of creating a new block.\n\nNow, Ethereum\u2019s PoS represents a significant improvement over PoW in terms of electricity consumption.\n\nWhile decentralization is crucial for blockchains to function effectively, it often comes with environmental costs. This appears to be about to change as Bitcoin and Ethereum mining together with BlockDAG Network mining hold the potential to drive a more sustainable and democratic future within the cryptocurrency industry. By embracing innovation, inclusion, and sustainability, these projects can pave the way for a greener, more resilient digital future.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "BlackRock: approval of the Ethereum ETF is possible - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, the founder and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, stated that he believes it is possible to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot even if the SEC manages to declare ETH a security.\n\nHe stated this during a live appearance on Fox Business.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF\n\nBlackRock has not only launched on the US stock exchanges what is set to become the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF, but a few months ago it also filed a request with the SEC to launch an ETF on Ethereum spot.\n\nAlthough BlackRock has a approval rating of over 99% for its ETF issuance requests, doubts are circulating about whether the SEC will approve it.\n\nYeah our odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%. I get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time. Note: 35% isn't 0%, still\u2026 https://t.co/QWQOGZjDC5 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 11, 2024\n\nThe problem is that the SEC considers ETH an unregistered security, and therefore traded on US markets illegally.\n\nHowever, it is not the government agency that can decide whether an asset should be considered a security or not, so much so that a court last year ruled against the SEC itself, which claimed that XRP should be considered a security.\n\nActually, the issue on XRP does not seem to be completely closed yet, both because XRP has been declared not to be an investment contract if purchased on the secondary market, but nothing has been decided yet for sales on the primary market, and because the lawsuit against Ripple is not yet over. Furthermore, in other similar cases, other judges have ruled differently.\n\nHowever, so far no judge has yet expressed an opinion on whether ETH should be considered a commodity like Bitcoin, or an unregistered security.\n\nETH as security\n\nThe issue with securities is that in the USA they can only be legally sold after receiving approval from the SEC.\n\nETH has not yet received this approval, also because it has never been requested.\n\nUntil last year it was believed that Ethereum was a commodity like Bitcoin, but the switch to Proof-of-Stake with the introduction of staking has questioned this definition.\n\nIt is possible to imagine that in order to reach a final judgment from a judge, which is the only way to do it, the SEC will first have to reject the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot in the USA, leading to a court appeal by the applicants.\n\nFor Bitcoin, on the other hand, something similar happened, because despite being clearly a commodity, the SEC initially rejected requests for the issuance of spot BTC ETFs in the USA.\n\nAt that point Grayscale sued the SEC, and a judge ruled in favor of Grayscale and against the SEC, paving the way for the subsequent approval.\n\nBy the end of May, the EC will necessarily have to pronounce itself on the requests for the issuance of ETFs on ETH spot, and at this point it seems likely that it will opt for an initial rejection, pending a subsequent explicit pronouncement by a court that clarifies the nature of ETH as a commodity or security.\n\nThe role of BlackRock in approving the Ethereum ETF\n\nIt is worth noting that the situation regarding Bitcoin spot ETFs began to unlock as early as June of last year, just when BlackRock submitted its request. In fact, it was known that its approval rate for ETFs was over 99%.\n\nLater, the court ruled in favor of Grayscale at the end of August, finally resolving the issue.\n\nSo yesterday\u2019s words from Larry Fink seem like a way to anticipate the SEC\u2019s moves.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s as if they stated that their request to issue an ETF on ETH spot on US exchanges will proceed even if the SEC refuses to approve it, using the excuse of considering ETH an unregistered security.\n\nMoreover, surely even in BlackRock they know very well that the SEC, in the midst of the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, could opt for a rejection in May, but they also know perfectly well that the issue would only be resolved in front of a judge at that point.\n\nBlackRock has now thrown itself headlong into the crypto sector, even launching a tokenized fund on Ethereum.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that this is a real giant, a global giant that manages over $10 trillion in assets, making it the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nThe price of Ethereum\n\nIn fact, the price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum ecosystem, has not been particularly affected by the assumption that the SEC will likely reject the ETFs in May.\n\nShortly after mid-October, the price of ETH entered a bullrun phase, ending on March 13th.\n\nThe price went from less than $1,700 to over $2,400 by the end of 2023, then rose to $2,700 in January 2024, and later to almost $4,100 on March 12.\n\nThis is a remarkable -150% in less than five months, although there was a correction afterwards that brought it back to $3,000.\n\nCurrently it has risen to over $3,500, which is a value 115% higher than before the bullrun started.\n\nInterestingly, however, it has not yet managed to update the highs of 2021, when it reached nearly $4,900. On the other hand, the TFs are pushing mainly Bitcoin, and it will probably take a while before they can also push ETH."

        "title": "ETH To USD: Navigating The Volatile Path Of Ethereum To US Dollar Conversion - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, the exchange rate between Ethereum (ETH) and the US dollar (USD) is a critical piece of information for traders, investors, and enthusiasts alike. Known as the ETH to USD conversion rate, this figure not only reflects the current market value of Ethereum but also serves as a key indicator of the cryptocurrency\u2019s health and investor sentiment. As Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, understanding the ETH to USD rate is essential for navigating the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that the ETH to USD rate can fluctuate wildly within short periods. These fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including market demand, investor sentiment, technological advancements within the Ethereum network, and broader economic indicators. For investors, these fluctuations present both opportunities for significant gains and risks of considerable losses, making it crucial to stay informed and adopt a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment.\n\nOne of the primary reasons investors monitor the ETH to USD conversion rate is to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding their Ethereum investments. For those looking to convert their ETH into USD, timing is everything. A high conversion rate means more dollars for each Ether sold, while a low rate can lead to losses if the investor purchased ETH when the dollar value was higher. Consequently, many investors engage in active market analysis, attempting to predict future movements in the ETH to USD rate based on current trends and news within the cryptocurrency and financial worlds.\n\nMoreover, the ETH to USD rate is not only important for individual investors but also plays a significant role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s value relative to the US dollar can impact the funding and viability of dApps and projects built on the Ethereum platform. A strong ETH to USD rate can encourage development and innovation within the ecosystem, while a weak rate may deter investment and development.\n\nGiven the importance of the ETH to USD conversion rate, several tools and platforms are available to help investors track and analyze these fluctuations. Cryptocurrency exchanges, financial news websites, and dedicated crypto analysis platforms offer real-time data and insights into the ETH to USD rate. Additionally, many of these services provide historical data, allowing investors to identify trends and patterns over time.\n\nTo navigate the volatility of the ETH to USD rate effectively, investors often employ a mix of strategies, including diversification, setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and staying updated on Ethereum network developments and global economic trends. Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, a long-term perspective and a tolerance for risk are also important traits for successful investors.\n\nIn conclusion, the ETH to USD conversion rate is a fundamental metric for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market. Whether you\u2019re an experienced investor, a newcomer to the world of digital currencies, or a developer working on Ethereum-based projects, understanding and monitoring this exchange rate is key to making informed decisions. With careful analysis and strategic planning, investors can navigate the complexities of the ETH to USD rate and capitalize on the opportunities within the dynamic and exciting world of cryptocurrency."

Amid speculations surrounding the ETF's chances of entering the market, analysts at market-making firm GSR have also tuned down the predictions of approval.\n\nRead more: SEC's lack of engagement won't affect spot Ethereum ETF approval decision, says Grayscale\n\nSEC not willing to engage\n\nBlackRock is one of eight companies that have submitted filings with the SEC to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. As the SEC's decision on the ETF, which is expected in May, draws near, key players in the market have expressed diverse opinions on the chances of an ETF approval for the second-largest digital asset.\n\nDiscussions over an Ethereum ETF follow the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which Larry Fink has said is \"the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs.\" BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT) is the largest among the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the market, with over $15 billion in assets under management. And the company is looking to exhibit the same success through a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAlso read: XRP ETF is likely to get approved before Ethereum: Valkyrie Funds CIO\n\nHowever, the SEC has been slow in responding to applications and has left many doubts due to its poor engagement with firms submitting applications. Fortune has also reported on the SEC's attempt to classify Ethereum as a security after the Commission issued subpoenas to three firms based on their transaction with the Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum's transition to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in 2022 also poses a challenge as yield bearing from staking could affect its commodity status.\n\nLarry Fink provides a glimmer of hope\n\nWhen asked by reporters of Fox Business if the SEC's recent actions would take Ethereum out of the Bitcoin category as a commodity and, in turn, harm its chances of an ETF, Larry Fink replied that he doesn't think that the SEC's designation is going to be that harmful to the possibility of an Ethereum ETF. After further pressing by the reporters asking if one could start a spot ETH ETF even if it's classified as a security, Larry Fink responded, \"I think so, yeah.\"\n\nMoreover, an analyst of market-making firm GSR, Brian Rudick, stated that the company had lowered its prediction of a spot Ethereum ETF approval chance to 20% from the 75% optimistic prediction it gave in January. He cited the SEC's low interest and political pressure against the approval of additional ETFs of digital assets as the main reasons. Two Democrat senators have earlier written to the SEC not to approve any more crypto ETFs, citing their high volatility as high risk for retail investors.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Foundation subpoenae threatens ETH ETF approval odds\n\nMany other analysts, including Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas and James Seyfarrt, have also downgraded their expectations of a spot Ethereum approval. In contrast, Coinbase and Grayscale chief legal officers have expressed hopes of a positive SEC response."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have shown some volatility in the past 24 hours, both trading 1% lower than they were this time yesterday.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has been hovering around $70,000 after looking like it might rise above $71,000 yesterday evening. It's now 0.9% lower than it was this time Thursday. Ethereum has also seen its own dip, currently trading at $3,557, marking a 1% decrease.\n\nOn the flip side, Binance Coin (BNB) has experienced a notable increase and is trading for almost $614. That's a 4.6% increase since yesterday and 7.7% higher than it was last week.\n\nThere's no telling how much the two are linked, but BNB is rising just as there are signs the crypto exchange and its executives are finding ways to fight back against allegations leveled at it from the Nigerian government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a local news outlet, Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to compel the Office of the National Security Advisor (NSA) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to apologize to him over his detention in the country. He's also filed a lawsuit alleging his fundamental human rights have been violated.\n\nFor nearly a month, Nigerian government officials had detained Gambaryan alongside another Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla\u2014who managed to escape custody earlier this week.\n\nMeme-while, popular Solana meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) has climbed another 17% since Thursday morning. It was only yesterday that WIF managed to flip PepeCoin (PEPE). Its $3.6 billion market capitalization makes it the 41st overall largest cryptocurrency. And in the meme category, it's now also much larger than Ethereum meme coin Floki Inu (FLOKI) and its Solana competitor Bonk (BONK).\n\nAnother top gainer in the last 24 hours has been the native token for the Celestia network, TIA.

        "title": "5 Cryptocurrencies That I Think Are Here to Stay - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With a crypto bull market in full swing, these cryptocurrencies stand above the rest.\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is constantly changing. Just because a cryptocurrency is here one day doesn't protect it from becoming worthless and losing relevance the next. In fact, it's so common for cryptocurrencies to fade to near worthlessness that the ones that maintain their value are often anomalies.\n\nWhile investing in whatever cryptocurrency is trendy and in the headlines can be alluring, investors are better off sticking with these five cryptocurrencies. Chances are exceedingly likely that they will be around for decades.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nThis one's easy. Every superlative we could give a cryptocurrency could apply to Bitcoin (BTC -2.02%). The list goes on and on: most decentralized, most secure, most resilient, most valuable.\n\nThese features have put Bitcoin at the top of the cryptocurrency market, and it is doubtful that we'll ever see it fall from this position. The world's first cryptocurrency has become synonymous with the entire asset class and naturally attracts the most buy-in and attention from investors.\n\nWith recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) showcasing Wall Street's growing interest, Bitcoin belongs in every crypto investor's portfolio. It isn't going anywhere.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nWith its introduction of smart contracts in 2015, Ethereum (ETH -2.26%) became the first programmable blockchain in the world. As a result, developers could build innovative applications such as non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins, paving the way for the creation of a burgeoning digital economy known as decentralized finance, or DeFi.\n\nToday, the DeFi market is worth more than $93 billion, and nearly 60% of that value calls the Ethereum blockchain home.\n\nEthereum's dominance in DeFi makes it the ideal choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to this disruptive sector. With anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF looming on the horizon, the influx of institutional capital into Ethereum is poised to propel its longevity and prominence in the financial landscape for years to come.\n\n3. Polygon\n\nWhile Ethereum offers leading levels of decentralization and security for DeFi use cases, it does face challenges in terms of speed and high fees. These issues prompted the creation of Layer-2 blockchains designed to address these limitations. Layer-2 solutions process transactions in batches and then finalize them on the Ethereum blockchain, making them faster and cheaper to use.\n\nRecognizing the value of Layer-2 solutions, Ethereum plans to integrate them symbiotically into its ecosystem. Among the various Layer-2 blockchains, Polygon (MATIC -2.43%) has emerged as a standout performer due to its comprehensive functionality. It offers high levels of security, flexibility, and reliability.\n\nAlthough other Layer-2 solutions may offer faster transaction speeds, Polygon possesses robust features that make it the premiere pick in its class. With top rankings in metrics like total daily transaction volume and number of unique users, as well as an impending upgrade that will make it more secure and versatile, Polygon stands to benefit from Ethereum's growing popularity as its primary Layer-2 companion.\n\n4. Solana\n\nLaunched in 2019, Solana (SOL -0.30%) has rapidly ascended among the group of blockchain networks that some describe as \"Ethereum killers.\" Lauded for their swift transaction speeds and cheap fees, these blockchains aim to address Ethereum's sluggishness and high costs without needing a Layer-2 solution.\n\nWhile it may not boast Ethereum's stringent security measures or decentralization, Solana's remarkable throughput has positioned it as the preferred blockchain for individuals seeking cost-effective and speedy transactions.\n\nDespite the distinct differences between Solana and Ethereum, there is undoubtedly a niche for Solana within the crypto landscape. As is natural in any market, some users will be attracted to the more cost-friendly options, and Solana is rising as the go-to blockchain to fill that role.\n\nTo make a comparison, think of Ethereum as a retailer like Whole Foods, where customers anticipate higher costs but prefer to pay a premium for higher-quality goods. In contrast, Solana mirrors the appeal and accessibility of a local dollar store that caters to budget-conscious individuals seeking efficiency.\n\n5. Coinbase\n\nLast but not least, we have Coinbase Global (COIN 6.28%). Obviously, Coinbase isn't a cryptocurrency, but its crypto-centric business model provides investors with comprehensive exposure to the entire spectrum of cryptocurrencies. This eliminates the need to navigate through the thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, thereby mitigating risk.

        "content": "In a recent interview on FOX Business, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his insights on the potential for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) amidst regulatory scrutiny.\n\nDespite concerns over a possible designation of Ethereum as a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fink expressed confidence in the feasibility of launching such an ETF.\n\nSEC\u2019s Stance on Ethereum Raises Doubts\n\nBlackRock and several other ETF providers have submitted applications for a spot Ethereum ETF to the SEC. However, there are doubts regarding the agency\u2019s approval of these ETFs as the May deadline approaches.\n\nWhen asked about the SEC\u2019s stance on ETH possibly being classified as a security, Fink refrained from providing detailed commentary but remained optimistic. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that designation is going to be too deleterious,\u201d Fink stated, suggesting that such a designation wouldn\u2019t necessarily hinder the creation of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIt was recently disclosed that the SEC is exploring the classification of Ethereum as a security and has issued subpoenas to three companies for details regarding the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit important to the growth and advancement of the blockchain. This development has raised concerns about the possibility of launching an Ethereum ETF in the United States.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts in the field are sharing differing opinions. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF experts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have voiced doubts, pointing to the SEC\u2019s minimal interaction with filings as worrisome. However, Craig Salm has countered this argument, suggesting that the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement shouldn\u2019t necessarily signal the approval outcome.\n\nFink Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nDespite these challenges, Fink remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects. BlackRock is not only pursuing an Ethereum ETF but also operates one of the most successful spot Bitcoin funds, the iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT), which has amassed over $17 billion in assets under management since its approval in January.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink says the $IBIT Spot #Bitcoin #ETF is the fastest growing ETF in history\n\npic.twitter.com/NOsDlFgROi \u2014 Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) March 27, 2024\n\nIBIT is the \u201cfastest-growing ETF in the history of ETFs,\u201d Fink stated on Fox Business. He also said he is \u201cvery bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. We\u2019re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised and would have never predicted it before we filed it that we were going to see this type of retail demand,\u201d he added."

Technical analysis also outlined a bullish outlook.\n\nThe retest was perfect in hindsight\n\nThe 1-day chart of Ethereum formed a swing low at $3056 on the 20th of March. Despite the deep retracement, the market structure remained bullish on the daily timeframe.\n\nThe RSI, which sank below 50, was at 54 at press time.\n\nThis indicated that bearish momentum briefly held sway, but the bulls were fighting for control once again. Meanwhile, the OBV did not test the mid-February resistance as support.\n\nTherefore, buying pressure remained stronger in the long term.\n\nThe selling volume in March was significant, but not enough to overthrow the buyers. The Fibonacci retracement levels (pale yellow) showed that the $3160 was a critical support level.\n\nPrices bounced from this level without closing the 1-day candle below it.\n\nAdditionally, the $3580 resistance was on the verge of being breached.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum network, believes meme coins can become higher quality projects that contribute positively to the crypto ecosystem and the world around them, squashing the narrative that such tokens are useless, racist, and sexist.\n\nAccording to a new report titled \u201cWhat Else Could Meme Coins Be?,\u201d Buterin looks forward to seeing meme coin projects that support public goods instead of enriching insiders and creators. He urged creators to make games instead of just tokens.\n\nMeme Coins Can Be More\n\nThe Ethereum founder cited a report he wrote ten years ago and published on Bitcoin Magazine, which addressed the role cryptocurrencies could play in funding important public projects like cancer research and saving the environment. He explained at the time that society needed new ways to fund valuable large-scale projects other than markets and institutions, and issuing new coins could fill in the gaps.\n\nPeople who wanted to support cancer research could hold and trade AntiCancerCoin, while those passionate about saving the environment could use ClimateCoin. These assets would determine which projects get funded, creating long-lasting and positive tokens that are different from what meme coins have become today.\n\nButerin explained that people participate in meme coin projects because they feel they are democratic and open for anyone, they are fun, and the value of the tokens may increase. He suggested that the crypto community could use a large percentage of a meme coin\u2019s supply to support valuable public causes, but that could happen at the expense of the token\u2019s worth and democracy.\n\nSo, the remedy would be to create gaming projects that are democratic, meaningful, fun, and have the tendency to rise in value.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don\u2019t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain,\u201d the Ethereum founder stated.\n\nCreating Interesting Games\n\nFurthermore, the computer programmer insisted that if the goal of creating meme coins and related games is to satisfy people\u2019s desire to have fun, then developers should stop making simple copy-and-paste coins. He urged owners of these projects to make the games more complicated and interesting.\n\nUsing blockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity as an example, Buterin commended how well the entity had improved the quality of its projects since its boom in 2021."

        "content": "Fri 29 Mar 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nThe balance of validators on Ethereum has always been a major concern. The more validators there are, the more secure the blockchain becomes. However, an overabundance of validators can lead to issues such as failed transactions. Recently, this issue has been reignited within the crypto community. Here are the details!\n\nThe Million Validators on Ethereum: Security at Stake\n\nWhile October 2023 saw a decline in crypto enthusiasts\u2019 interest in becoming a \u2018validator\u2019 on Ethereum, this trend was short-lived. Apparently, the situation has changed: the number of validators on the blockchain has exploded.\n\nNr. of validator is issue (too many can ultimatively lead to failed transactions). But the max. effective staking amount (>32ETH) should mitigate that risk. \u2014 Gabriel Weide (@AlphapingG) March 27, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum network has just crossed a major milestone with one million validators now active, reports Cointelegraph. It\u2019s a significant milestone, demonstrating growing confidence in the blockchain. With 32 million ETH at stake, valued at over 114 billion dollars, securing the network has become a priority.\n\nThe tracking platform Dune Analytics reported this historic step on March 28th. The data shows that 26% of the total ETH supply is currently staked, providing a solid foundation for the network\u2019s security and resilience.\n\nStaking pools, particularly Ethereum Lido, are gaining in popularity. These platforms allow small ETH holders to participate in the staking process by pooling their resources, thereby reinforcing the decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in protecting the network against malicious activities such as double spending. By engaging in the proposal and validation of transactions, they contribute to the reliability and robustness of Ethereum.\n\nTo become a validator, a minimum stake of 32 ETH is required. In return for their commitment, validators receive a reward in the form of ETH, thus encouraging ongoing participation and maintaining the security of the network.\n\nToo Many Validators Kill Crypto Transactions!\n\nIn the world of Ethereum, security is an absolute priority. But with a million active validators, some experts are starting to worry. According to veteran investor Evan Van Ness, the current number of validators is already \u201ctoo high,\u201d a sentiment shared by stake pool manager Gabriel Weide, who fears \u201cmissed transactions,\u201d as stated in the tweet above.\n\nPeter Kim from Coinbase Wallet acknowledges that the impressive number of validators is partly due to the 32 ETH limit imposed. However, he suggests that changes may be on the horizon.\n\nVitalik Buterin Proposes Sanctions\n\nIn the race to decentralization, Ethereum visionary Vitalik Buterin has a new idea. On March 27th, he unveiled a plan to make the network fairer by penalizing validators based on their failure rates.\n\nAccording to his proposal, validators would face harsher penalties for repeated failures. Buterin hopes to reduce the advantage large ETH holders have over smaller ones.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time such an initiative has been advanced. In June 2023, researchers proposed capping the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE at 2,048 ETH, already sparking controversies within the crypto community.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US approved a host of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the beginning of January 2024, from well-known financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and more. In fact, a new Bitcoin spot ETF from Hashdex has also joined the ranks recently- they have converted a Bitcoin futures fund into the new spot ETF to trade under the ticker DEFI.\n\n\n\nFollowed by the historical success of these BTC funds, the asset management firm Bitwise has knocked at the SEC\u2019s door with an application for a spot Ethereum ETF on March 28, Thursday. It\u2019s to be noted that Bitwise joins the fray quite late indeed- there are several spot ETH ETF applications pending the SEC\u2019s approval already.\n\n\n\nThe institutions seeking approval to launch Ethereum spot ETFs include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy, among others.\n\n\n\nAs for the performance of the Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC are leagues ahead of the rest, both having over $10 billion in AUM (assets under management) as of the end of March 2024. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, recently pointed out that of 11,338 funds from all over the world in their first 50 trading days, the list of the top 30 holds four of the US Bitcoin ETFs. Of course, the aforementioned IBIT and FBTC take the lead, holding the first and second spots, respectively.\n\n\n\nAfter its spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise has filed a Form S-1 registration statement for shares in the aforementioned Ethereum ETF; based upon a 19b-4 amendment filing with the regulator, Bitwise has plans to list the shares of its ETH spot ETF on NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) Arca.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the market speculates that the SEC may be looking to name ETH a security after its conversion into a proof-of-stake blockchain. This may complicate approvals for Ethereum spot ETFs in the US, delaying their arrival. Expert opinions are divided: while some believe the SEC will give a go ahead to the Ethereum instruments after all, most are expecting them to be hindered.\n\n\n\nAll eyes are now on the SEC, as their final deadline for the approval of three spot ETH ETF applications approaches in May.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist.\n\nTwitter: @bhardwajshash\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF: BlackRock CEO Sees Approval Despite Security Scare - CoinGape",
        "content": "In an interview between FOX Business Network\u2019s Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the latter shared his optimism of a possible approval for spot Ethereum ETF from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBlackRock CEO Voices Support for ETH\n\nIn the latest edition of The Claman Countdown series hosted by Liz Claman, Gasparino pointed out that the United States SEC has been trying to declare Ethereum as security. This means the regulator is doing its best to take out the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization from the Bitcoin commodity categorization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nConsidering the SEC\u2019s position on Ethereum, Gasparino posed a question to the BlackRock CEO, inquiring him how he thinks the whole situation will play out when viewed from an ETF angle. Although he was a little reluctant to address the question, Fink responded to Gasparino\u2019s question, stating clearly that he didn\u2019t think any potential designation given to Ethereum was going to negatively impact the crypto that much.\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW: Larry Fink on $ETH spot ETF: @CGasparino: There's a lot of noise about the SEC declaring ether a security which would take it out of the bitcoin category as a commodity. How does that translate into an ETF? Fink: \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2013 look and I really can\u2019t talk about this\u2026 https://t.co/si9ZiM6z30 pic.twitter.com/SVFcGvwRRg \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 27, 2024\n\nTo further establish Fink\u2019s stance on the Ethereum classification, the FOX Business correspondent asked him if his firm would still move forward with a spot Ethereum ETF if the underlying crypto is finally declared a security. Fink\u2019s response of \u201cI think so, yeah\u201d did not portray certainty but it still suggests that BlackRock is interested in the moving spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nFor an asset management company that happens to be the best-performing spot Bitcoin ETF issuer, BlackRock\u2019s support for a potential spot Ethereum ETF is not unfounded. While at the Claman Countdown series, Fink even acknowledged the Bitcoin ETF as the fastest-growing ETF in all of history. The fact that the Bitcoin ETF has conveniently outperformed gold ETFs is a confirmation of BlackRock CEO\u2019s claim.\n\nThe Wait for Spot Ethereum Approval\n\nIn November, BlackRock filed for a spot Ethereum ETF with the U.S. SEC but since that time, no response has been given by the regulator about the filing.\n\nRather, the decision on the spot Ethereum ETF application from BlackRock was postponed by the U.S. SEC until March 10, 2024. It\u2019s been more than two weeks since the new date for a decision from the agency but no answer has been given yet.\n\nMany market observers are suddenly becoming concerned that a spot Ethereum ETF may never be a reality. Their fears were compounded recently after Gary Gensler, SEC Chair, started avoiding discussions on the subject of Ethereum ETFs. The SEC Chair equally received a letter from Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed and California Senator Laphonza Butler, asking him to meticulously scrutinize and pay caution in the approval process for further crypto ETFs.\n\nThe talks about Ethereum classification as security are intensifying and it is believed that this would most likely impede the possibility for spot Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nCryptocurrency investors are no strangers to the potential returns from hidden gems beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. In recent years, projects like Solana, Cardano, and Algorand have been on the radar of those seeking the next big thing in blockchain technology. These platforms promise scalability, security, and innovation, positioning themselves as potential contenders to Ethereum\u2019s throne and its token Ether (ETH).\n\nAnd to profit from this healthy competition during the next crypto bull run, it doesn\u2019t get any more convenient than AI trading platforms. With a blend of sophisticated algorithms, deep learning models, and real-time market analysis, AlgosOne offers a simple and profitable way to invest in Solana, Cardano, Algorand, and other promising projects, regardless of your level of expertise.\n\nJoin the revolution and sign up to AlgosOne today!\n\nThe Ethereum Killer Trio: Solana, Cardano, and Algorand\n\nWhat are commonly called \u201cEthereum killers\u201d are Layer 1 blockchain projects looking to solve Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings such as high gas fees or low number of transactions per second. Among those, we have selected three projects that have been attracting investors\u2019 attention, both for their technological development and return potential.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nLaunched in 2020, Solana\u2019s primary goal is to tackle the scalability challenges that have hindered many blockchain networks, including Ethereum. With the innovative Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism and remarkably fast transaction speeds, Solana stands as a leading contender.\n\nInvestors are drawn to SOL for its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and projects ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano, often dubbed the \u201cEthereum of Japan,\u201d is also a solid competitor. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the project focuses on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability.\n\nWhat sets Cardano apart is its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, aimed at enhancing scalability and energy efficiency compared to traditional proof-of-work (PoW) systems like Bitcoin.\n\nAlgorand (ALGO)\n\nCreated by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand aims to establish a decentralized ecosystem capable of handling high-volume transactions while maintaining decentralization principles.\n\nALGO, the native token of the Algorand network, fuels various applications within the ecosystem, including DeFi platforms, stablecoins, and asset tokenization, providing a robust foundation for the future of finance.\n\nAlgosOne\u2019s Efficiency Explained\n\nWhether investors are looking to buy Bitcoin, invest in the next Ethereum, go for higher-risk, higher-reward altcoins, or diversify their portfolio with traditional assets, AlgosOne covers all their investment needs with its user-friendly, all-in-one online trading platform.

The Crypto Greed and Fear Index has dropped to 80 (extreme greed) from 83 in the last 24 hours, indicating a drop in buying before expiry and PCE inflation data.\n\nDeribit said this Friday marks one of the biggest expiry in crypto derivatives exchange\u2019s history as $9.5 billion BTC options open interest out of $26.3 billion will expire. Moreover, $5.7 billion ETH options open interest out of a total of $13.2 billion will expire on March 22 at 8:00 AM UTC. The market could see massive buying during post-expiry, with traders eyeing a new all-time high for BTC and ETH prices.\n\nFurthermore, $465 million in BTC March Future and $230 million in the March ETH future will expire, which is approximately $700 million of $1.9 billion.\n\nNotably, 135K BTC options of notional value $9.5 billion are set to expire, with a put-call ratio of 0.85. The max pain point is $51,000, indicating massive volatility is expected amid huge delivery and reshuffling of positions. Volatile price movements are always expected during options expiry, but positive sentiment to likely drive upward momentum in BTC price to $75K.\n\nBTC price currently trading at $71,200, up 2% from the 24-hour low of $68,381.\n\nMoreover, 1,575K ETH options of notional value of almost $5.6 billion are set to expire, with a put-call ratio of 0.63.

BTC price crashed after the expiry. However, demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs will help reduce some impact of the options expiry.\n\nWe are far away from the \"Max pain\" price for both $BTC & $ETH. These are usually the levels at which option sellers try to pin prices in the spot market to inflict losses on the buyers.

        "content": "In a gripping narrative shake-up, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently took to a post on X, showcasing a sense of immense dismay in meme coins. This post by one of the world\u2019s most prominent blockchain co-founders nabbed global attention, coming in the midst of a meme coin frenzy witnessed within the broader crypto market.\n\nWhile meme tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and WIF rallied remarkably over the past few days, the post shared by Vitalik contrasted market sentiments, spotlighting a plethora of reasons why meme coins reflect disdain despite their popularity. This stirred a whirlpool of speculations questioning the narrative of issuing coins as a novel approach to funding significant public endeavors, as Vitalik stated.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Disappointed in Meme Coins: Here\u2019s Why\n\nAligning with the post Vitalik shared on X, the idea behind \u2018issuing coins to fund public endeavors\u2019 was primarily to offer an alternative funding mechanism alongside markets and institutions, bridging gaps where traditional methods falter. To this, the co-founder added, imagine having an AntiCancerCoin to jack up cancer research or a ClimateCoin to support environmental causes. However, moving on to today\u2019s era, the crypto realm is dominated by memecoins.\n\nConcerning this, at the core, memecoins magnetize users due to their potential value increase, perceived inclusivity, and entertainment value. Nonetheless, diverting memecoins\u2019 supply towards supporting public endeavors remains frowned upon as it doesn\u2019t directly benefit users and may compromise value and inclusivity.\n\nThis collectively, among a few other reasons listed, is collectively attributed to Vitalik\u2019s dejection in memecoins, despite the phenomenal gains showcased amid the ongoing meme coin frenzy.\n\nAlso Read: Prisma Finance Hacker Moves Funds to Tornado Cash\n\nIs There A More Positive Approach?\n\nIn the same post, Vitalik drew attention to Charity coins and Robin Hood games, highlighting the potential benefits they offer compared to meme coins while also offering the same satisfaction. Concerning this, Vitalik spotlighted Robin Hood\u2019s potential of play-to-earn features like Axie Infinity to uplift low-income users financially.\n\nSimilarly, pointing out charity coins, the chronicle wherein a substantial portion of the coins\u2019 supply is donated to charitable causes conveys immense optimism not only for the crypto realm but also for the real world. Although these approaches may appear beneficial, there still remains grounds for more work to be done as they present their own challenges.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Gas Fees : Can You Really Get Ethereum Gas Fees Refund\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "BlackRock CEO said Ethereum ETF approval is likely despite ETH designation.\n\nHopeful issuers are adding \u201cstaking\u201d to \u2018nudge the SEC.\u201d\n\nBlackrock\u2019s Larry Fink\u2019s recent take on Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval has many commentators speculating on possible outcomes.\n\nIn a recent interview with FOX Business, Larry Fink was asked if one can start an ETH ETF even if ETH is designated as \u201csecurity.\u201d To which he answered,\n\n\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d\n\nHe added that ETH designation or categorization won\u2019t harm ETF approval.\n\nFink\u2019s revelation has sparked new speculation.\n\nETH ETF approval in May\n\nNate Geraci of ETF Store reacted to Fink\u2019s revelation on X (formerly Twitter) and shared his opinion;\n\n\u201cJust reading b/w lines & speculating, sounds like SEC seriously trying to classify eth as security. If so, tough to have optimism on May spot eth ETF approval. That said, Fink says SEC could still allow spot eth ETF post-security classification.\u201d\n\nAnother source of confusion regarding the ETH ETF approval is the addition of \u201cstaking\u201d in recent amendments by potential issuers.\n\nOn 27th March, Fidelity amended its ETH ETF filing to include \u201cstaking\u201d to users. The filing stated;\n\n\u201cAs a result of any staking activity in which the trust may engage, the trust expects to receive certain staking rewards of ether, which may be treated for federal income tax purposes as income to the trust.\u201d\n\nLike Fidelity, Grayscale\u2019s ETH ETF filing included staking.\n\nHowever, these trends are confusing given the SEC\u2019s stance on staking, as seen during the Kraken lawsuit in 2023.\n\nDuring the Kraken fine, the SEC warned that,\n\n\u201cWhen investors provide tokens to staking-as-a-service providers, they lose control of those tokens and take on risks associated with those platforms, with very little protection.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas claimed that the reason hopeful issuers are adding staking on the filing is to,\n\n\u201cTo nudge the SEC, hope squeaky wheel gets grease. And, I respect the hustle but I just think SEC\u2019s mind is decided on this.\u201d\n\nThe Bloomberg ETF analyst has maintained a pessimistic 25% odd of May approval for ETH ETFs.\n\nHowever, Fink\u2019s positive inclination toward approval, even if ETH is classified as a \u201csecurity,\u201d is worth noting. If Fink\u2019s stance pans out, we might eventually have an ETH ETF either way."

As it rises, altcoins are following suit, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices posting almost similar gains. Meanwhile, there remains an unfilled CME Gap, with a lot of liquidity also resting above and below BTC price.\n\n#Bitcoin CME Gap remains open as price is moving higher.\n\n\n\nShows you why it's important not to fixate on these too much, it can really throw you off.\n\n\n\nFact is, during bull markets, gaps get created and often don't get closed.\n\n\n\nSame in bear markets with gaps above that sometimes\u2026 https://t.co/2DP0Cgq1U1 pic.twitter.com/IGNQ2p0NkO \u2014 Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) March 28, 2024\n\nAnalysts are now awaiting some action, one side or the other as the market remains rather inactionable as Bitcoin price oscillators within a narrow range of between $70,700 and $68,240. With this outlook, retail continues to watch from the sidelines with a subtle bias for short\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds above $70K as old whales sell BTC to TradFi, not retail\n\nBitcoin bulls haul BTC above $70,000\n\nBitcoin price is well above $70,000 as BTC bulls resurface. However, without any significant catalyst to drive the BTC market, traders have a bias for shorts, anticipating a correction before the next leg up.\n\nWhile this is plausible, it may be delayed as technicals flash bullish. First, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains well above the 50 midline, with higher highs amid rising momentum. Both the Awesome Oscillator and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are showing green histograms, suggesting a growing bullish sentiment.\n\nIf the bulls increase their buying pressure, BYC could extend to recover its peak at $73,777, with the potential to clear this roadblock and record a higher high.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flip side, traders starting to cash in now could cut the rally short for Bitcoin price, causing a retraction. If it breaks and closes below the mean threshold of the supply zone at $61,509, it could open the drains for an extended fall.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin extends retreat from $69K as old whales shift their holdings to new whales\n\nEthereum price likely to correct 10% before a pivot\n\nWith Bitcoin price still stalling, Ethereum price could drop around 10% to $3,160 before a possible recovery. For one, the MACD has crossed below the signal line, while the AO histograms are red hot to show a weakening bullish trend.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, the bulls could still haul Ethereum price north, considering the RSI is rejecting further downside. Increased buying strength could see ETH price extend to take back the $4,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock CEO optimistic on Ethereum ETF, but GSR analyst lowers approval odds to 20%\n\nRipple price could drop below $0.6\n\nAlso pegged to the show of strength in the BTC market, weakness in Bitcoin price could influence XRP price, causing the payments token\u2019s market value to drop below the $0.6000 psychological level and potentially to the bottom of the ascending parallel channel.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nHowever, enhanced buying strength could set XRP price in discovery mode, sending it high to breach $0.7000 level. While a move above $0.7620 would be a good sign, the most desirable flip would be that involving the $0.8442 support.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price stuck below $0.65 resistance, Ripple lawsuit could suffer from Coinbase defeat"

        "content": "An Ethereum whale that has been holding ETH for a long period of time sells its holdings.\n\nPrice of ETH remains unaffected, however, activity on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem poses concerns.\n\nAfter seeing a massive rally over the last week, the price of Ethereum[ETH] started to get stagnant around the $3500 price level. Due to this stagnancy, many holders decided to indulge in profit-taking.\n\nWhale takes profit\n\nAccording to recent data, an initial holder of ETH exchanged 17,770 ETH for 62.24 million DAI at a rate of $3,503 per ETH.\n\nThis individual amassed 14,280 ETH, valued at approximately $2.6 million, at an average price of only around $182, spanning purchases made from Gemini and Bittrex between March 2017 and April 2021.\n\nWith a staggering gain of 23 times their initial investment, the profit amounts to $59 million.\n\nThis whale\u2019s sale of 17,770 ETH injects a large amount of the currency into the market. This can cause downward pressure on the price in the short term, especially if there aren\u2019t enough buyers to absorb all the ETH being sold.\n\nHowever, the overall impact depends on market sentiment. If the sale triggers panic selling, the price could drop further. But, if the market views it as a healthy correction or the whale is simply taking profits, the price could stabilize or even rebound as others see a buying opportunity.\n\nETH remains resilient\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,571.59, marking a 27% difference from its all-time high. The price of ETH had tested the $3674.23 levels twice over the last few weeks.\n\nIf ETH manages to break past this level, it will put an end to the bearish trend that was observed after its price fell from $4081.55. ETH could also possibly head in the direction of the $4081.55 resistance yet again.\n\nHowever, the coin\u2019s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) declined in the last few days, indicating that the money flow for ETH had fallen. This suggests that the price of ETH could see a period of sideways or downward movement before it starts to rally.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nState of the Ethereum network\n\nThe popularity of the Ethereum ecosystem will also aid ETH positively in the future. The gas usage on the Ethereum network remained consistent over the past month, suggesting a highly active ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the overall number of NFTs being traded on the network fell significantly over the last few days, indicating that the interest in NFTs on the Ethereum ecosystem fell. This could hurt the activity on the Ethereum network in the long run."

        "title": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Ethereum ETFs Feasible Regardless of Security Status, Remains Bullish on BTC - Crypto News Australia",
        "content": "Larry Fink believes Ethereum ETFs could work even if ETH is deemed a security, challenging conventional wisdom.\n\nFink remains bullish on Bitcoin, citing the rapid growth of BlackRock\u2019s IBIT as the fastest growing ETF in history.\n\nDespite typical advice, Fink reveals he\u2019s 100% invested in equities at age 71, demonstrating his strong belief in the market\u2019s potential.\n\nWe know that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is generally positive about markets and stocks, and more recently this is also true for Bitcoin. But what about Ethereum? Asked by Charlie Gasparino on Fox Business about the applications for Spot Ethereum ETFs, Fink said he wasn\u2019t in the position to comment.\n\nRelated: Judge Sides With SEC, Advancing Case Against Coinbase in Setback for Crypto Industry\n\nBut, pressed on the recent discussions about Ethereum potentially being a security, Fink said he doesn\u2019t believe this to \u201cbe that deteriorous [sic].\u201d\n\nGasparino answered: \u201cSo even if it\u2019s a security, you can start an ETH ETF?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich Fink, without giving reasons countered with: \u201cI think so, yes.\u201d\n\nThe Fox Business reporter was surprised by that response\u2014but in reality, ETFs often contain various types of investments, like securities such as stocks and bonds. The key point here is that the regulatory classification of an asset as a \u201csecurity\u201d does not preclude its inclusion in an ETF per se.\n\nSource: Fox Business via YouTube\n\nHence, if Ethereum were classified as a security, it would not automatically disqualify it from being included in an ETF. Instead, the structure and operation of the ETF would need to adhere to the regulatory frameworks that apply to securities.\n\nFink Remains Bullish on Bitcoin\n\nThe other topic at the tip of the tongue of hosts Gasparino and Liz Claman was of course Bitcoin and the Spot ETFs. These ETFs, approved only less than three months ago, are among the fastest growing ETFs in history. In fact, IBIT, which is BlackRock\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF, is the fastest growing ETF ever, according to Fink himself.\n\n\u201cIBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs, nothing has gained assets as fast as IBIT in the history of ETFs.\u201d Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO\n\nSo naturally Fink, who is overall bullish on the markets is very bullish on Bitcoin.\n\nLook, I\u2019m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin. That surprised me how much that\u2019s gone up. I mean, look, we\u2019re creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency\u2014and I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO\n\nNews Flash: Larry Fink is 100% in Equities At 71\n\nTowards the end of the segment Fink\u2019s own allocation in the markets came up. Despite BlackRock\u2019s (non-financial advice) advice to ease out of equities as one gets older and only hold 40% of equities in a portfolio close to retirement, Fink made the astonishing revelation that he himself is still 100% in equities.\n\nFink said he is a strong believer in capitalism and that humans work hard on improving things\u2014and of course in the effects of compounding.\n\nFocusing on the compounding, believing in having hope that the future is better than today. And that has been my whole notion that we as human beings, we solve solutions [sic]. We make things better over time. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO\n\nGasparino couldn\u2019t believe it when Fink revealed he is 100% in on equities at his age, jokingly saying that it makes for a great headline.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong To Debut BTC ETF, London To List BTC And ETH ETNs\n\nSo that\u2019s a headline. Larry Fink is 100% in equities at 71. Charlie Gasparino, Fox Business Charlie Gasparino, Fox Business\n\nThis is of course not investment advice."

        "content": "In the face of financial adversity, one individual has chosen a path less traveled. This trader\u2019s story is living proof of the human spirit\u2019s resilience and adaptability, demonstrating how one can calmly go through the stormy seas of financial distress and chart a course toward recovery.\n\nA trader, burdened with a disturbing debt of $500,000, found himself on the brink of bankruptcy, per his confession on Coinfessions X handle, yesterday, July 13. His business had shuttered, and he had ceased all minimum payments. His only source of income was the occasional sale of cryptocurrency to his bank account.\n\nThe plan now is to burn all of my crypto until it runs out pic.twitter.com/LqBpULexWq \u2014 Coinfessions (@coinfessions) August 13, 2024\n\nDespite the dire circumstances, the trader refused to surrender. He decided to stop all minimum payments and let the creditors sue him, responding with the \u201cbig B\u201d \u2014 bankruptcy.\n\nBankruptcy, a legal process that provides relief to individuals or businesses who can no longer afford to pay their bills by offering them a fresh start, which usually begins with a petition filed by the debtor, is often seen as a last resort, a step taken when all other options have been exhausted, and the assets may be used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt.\n\nUsing the crypto lifeline\n\nAmid these financial woes, our guy has found a lifeline in cryptocurrency. His only income coming in is from selling crypto to his bank account. Cryptocurrency trading strategies such as Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), Swing Trading, and Technical Analysis can effectively manage and grow one\u2019s crypto assets.\n\nDCA, for instance, involves throwing in a fixed amount in a particular cryptocurrency at regular intervals, regardless of its price, and it leads to good returns over time. Thus, the trader plans to begin DCAing into crypto again in the fall of 2025 as we enter a bear market \u2014 a period where the value of major cryptocurrencies has fallen at least 20% from their recent highs and is continuing to fall. It\u2019s a time when pessimistic investors believe prices will continue to fall.\n\nTaking a cue from this trader, you, too, need a well-thought-out trading strategy if you must recoup losses in this crypto trading should things go awry.\n\nThe road to recovery\n\nThe journey to financial recovery is often long and arduous, but it\u2019s not impossible. The trader planned to exhaust all his cryptocurrency holdings before filing for bankruptcy. He even booked vacations to the Dominican Republic and other locations, intending to spend his remaining crypto until it ran out. His estimated timeline for bankruptcy was nine months, which would put him in the fall of 2025.\n\nThis story, which has garnered over 127k views and 39 reposts on X (formerly Twitter), teaches us that while money is important, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all of life. As even the trader puts it, he\u2019s \u201cdown but not out.\u201d\n\nHis story ends with an even more defiant note, \u201cThey won\u2019t get a damn penny\u2026(I\u2019ll never leave).\u201d"
