        "title": "How two brothers allegedly swiped $25M in a 12-second Ethereum heist - The Register",
        "content": "The US Department of Justice has booked two brothers on allegations that they exploited open source software used in the Ethereum blockchain world to bag $25 million (\u00a320 million).\n\nThe pair \u2013 computer scientists Anton, 24, of Boston, and James Pepaire-Bueno, 28, of New York \u2013 are accused of carrying out what deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco called a \"technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months.\"\n\n\"The defendants' scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" added United States attorney Damian Williams.\n\n\"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe. And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds.\"\n\nSome background\n\nCryptocurrency blockchains, including the one behind Ethereum and its native coin Ether, are pretty much a decentralized append-only log file of transfers, and use cryptography to maintain the integrity of the log. That makes a blockchain essentially a public ledger of every single transaction that takes place, and users can only make transactions with money they actually have. These transactions are grouped onto blocks that are chained together, hence the name.\n\nAnd a whole load of cryptocurrencies \u2013 from stablecoins such as Tether that's pegged to one US dollar apiece, to roller-coaster meme-coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe \u2013 use the Ethereum blockchain; it's not just Ether.\n\nThe stewardship of the Ethereum blockchain is entrusted to validators, which are typically automated systems directed by human operators. As the name suggests, validator bots attest that proposed blocks of Ethereum transactions are valid and send those blocks to a committee of fellow validators to approve by vote and securely add to the chain.\n\nGenerally speaking, validators must each stake 32 Ether (equivalent right now to $100,000). When randomly picked to propose a new block for the chain, a validator has roughly 12 seconds to complete that operation and offer a valid block to its peers to verify and accept for the chain. If validators misbehave, they face losing their stake; if they perform as expected, they are rewarded.\n\nIt does get a bit more complicated in practice. Where do these proposed blocks mainly come from? Well, while awaiting confirmation on the blockchain, pending transactions sit in a public staging area called the memory pool or mempool. Bots called searchers rifle through those pending transactions, and using fun algorithms assemble bundles of transactions for builder bots to package together into blocks for validators to consider for the chain. In fact, builder bots can also use interesting algorithms to combine and optimize bundles from multiple searchers to craft these proposed transaction blocks.\n\nThe builders stand to receive a reward in terms of fees and other sources when their proposed blocks make it onto the chain, and the validators approving the blocks get a cut of that income.\n\nIt's in the interests of the validators to pick the blocks that are the most profitable, it's in the builders' interests to construct blocks that look attractive to validators, and the blockchain's users pay fees to get their transactions picked up. The builders and their searchers get to order the transactions in the blocks as they see fit; the transactions execute in that order when the block gets the green light.\n\nThe builders offer their proposed blocks to validators via relays. The relays only provide just enough info to the validators for those bots to determine how much they stand to gain from accepting a particular block, and not the specifics of the transactions; when a validator accepts a block for processing, it gets the full details from the relay to analyze and attest. Nine out of ten validator bots use an open source program called MEV-Boost to communicate with multiple relays to select the most-rewarding block from a whole range of builders competing for a payout.\n\nThis design is supposed to be resilient to manipulation and other shenanigans while ensuring all these bot operators get paid for keeping this decentralized system going. However, according to an indictment [PDF] unsealed on Wednesday, the brothers exploited a weakness in the MEV-Boost project's code to make off with millions in crypto.\n\nThe MEV in MEV-Boost stands for Maximum or Maximal Extractable Value, and is fairly complex, but essentially it's what the validators, builders, and their searchers stand to make from crafting, proposing, and attesting a block of carefully picked and ordered transactions from the mempool buffer. And as we said, there are various ways these participants can make money off this validation process.\n\nFor example, there's nothing stopping mempool searchers from doing currency arbitrage. A searcher bot can clock from the mempool transactions that users are buying up a particular cryptocurrency, which will increase the market value of that token. The searcher can form a bundle of transactions that begins with the bot's operator acquiring that cryptocurrency, then includes other people's pending mempool transactions for that coin, and finishes with the bot selling the coin. If that carefully arranged bundle makes it into an offered block, and is picked by a validator and accepted onto the chain, the transactions execute in order, and the searcher stands to make a profit from selling the coin at a higher price than it was bought at as the market value increased during the process. The searcher can offer to pay block builders to use its bundle knowing it will still make a profit.\n\nSearchers and builders set the order of transactions in a proposed block, but so can validators: A validator chosen by the system to provide the next block can go it alone and offer its own block for committee approval. That's why relays usually withhold the full details of proposed blocks until a validator promises, using a digital signature according to the US Dept of Justice, to attest a chosen block. Otherwise, a validator could look through all the proposed blocks, pick a profitable one, and then create its own block based on that offered one, and pass it to the committee to accept, screwing over the searchers and builders by taking the rewards.\n\nPulling off a '$25M heist in 12 seconds'\n\nProsecutors claim the pair found a flaw in the MEV-Boost project's relay code that could be exploited to release the full details of a proposed block prematurely. Thus, the duo allegedly set up validators that exploited a relay to hand over a complete proposed block too early, rejigged the transaction list to their advantage, and sent the block off for committee approval, netting them a hefty windfall.\n\nThe complaint claims a shell company called Pine Needle Inc was set up in December 2022 by the brothers to perform their banking and cryptocurrency exchange activities. In particular, they didn't want to do business with crypto-exchanges that had a \"know your customer\" policy, and performed online searches for \"how to wash crypto\" and \"cefi exchanges with no kyc,\" court documents state. The men also carried out a bunch of transactions to observe how searchers operated by three particular traders reacted, it's claimed.\n\nBetween February and March the following year, the complaint alleges, the sibling duo sent 529.5 Ether coins (worth $880K at the time) to the Ethereum network and used 512 of them to stake 16 validators at 32 Ether apiece.\n\nOn April 2, they decided to carry out the exploit, prosecutors said. First, the duo waited for one of their validators to be randomly selected to provide the next block for the Ethereum chain. Once that had happened, they then put in eight orders for particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies, it's said.\n\nThe three traders' automated searchers took the bait, it's claimed, and offered bundles of transactions to block builders that aimed to achieve the following: Buy up $25 million of those illiquid cryptocurrencies using stablecoins and other liquid assets, run the brothers' transactions, and then sell that cryptocurrency at a higher price and pocket the difference.\n\nThat proposal reached the brother's validator via a relay, it's said, and the validator allegedly exploited that relay \u2013 by sending it a dodgy digital signature \u2013 that caused it to reveal the full contents of the proposed block. The validator then allegedly altered the transaction list to: Let the traders buy up that illiquid cryptocurrency; and sell off all of the brothers' holdings of those illiquid coins \u2013 the ones just bought as bait and the ones from the aforementioned observations.\n\nThe allegedly altered block was sent off for verification by committee vote and accepted onto the chain. It effectively, we're told, caused the traders to buy the illiquid cryptocurrency from the duo, who got $25 million in stablecoins and other liquid assets in exchange. The traders, meanwhile, got a mountain of now highly illiquid coins that were suddenly pretty worthless; the Feds said the liquidity pool for the cryptocurrency had been drained.\n\nThat $25 million went right out of the traders' hands in just 12 seconds, it's said. As far as the Ethereum world was concerned at the time, the deal was all above board. Details of the alleged exploit were not disclosed by the Feds, and we're looking into whether the hole, as described, has been patched yet.\n\nI'm feeling unlucky, Google\n\nThe day after the alleged heist, James Peraire-Bueno is said to have asked one of the shell company's banks for a safety deposit box big enough to fit a laptop. The next day, the Feds claim, he also asked the operators of a website that hosted the source code for MEV-Boost for its policy on logging IP addresses of visitors.\n\nMeanwhile, the complaint alleges, Anton Peraire-Bueno searched online for \"top crypto lawyers\" and asked things like \"how long is us statue [sic] of limitations\" for crimes like wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nIf true, it would mean the brothers crafted a far from foolproof scheme, despite allegedly being able to take advantage of a multi-million dollar exploit.\n\nThe complaint goes on to claim that a victim of the trade, his lawyer, and an Ethereum project representative attempted to convince the Peraire-Bueno brothers to give back their gains. It goes on to allege that, rather than come clean, they proceeded to launder the money through several different channels. About $3 million was allegedly frozen by foreign law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile $20 million was eventually funneled into another shell company, Birch Bark Trading LLC, the complaint alleges. From there, the pair would have needed to move it into their brokerage account. According to the Feds, they didn't know how to do this, nor what the consequences would be. The court docs claim their Google searches included things like \"money laundering\" and \"does the united states extradite to [foreign country].\" By December 8, $19.6 million had made its way into the brokerage account, we're told.\n\nProsecutors announced the pair's arrests this week. Both men \u2013 charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering \u2013 face potential jail time of up to 20 years for each of the three counts. They will also have to repay any ill-gotten gains if convicted. \u00ae"

        "title": "IBC to Ethereum: Building the interconnected Internet of Blockchains - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Since the advent of Bitcoin in 2009 and the explosion of innovation that followed, the web3 industry has faced many challenges. Beyond dealing with regulators, improving UX, and weeding out bad actors, blockchain engineers continue to tackle two major hurdles: scalability and interoperability.\n\nWhile many Layer 2s are working to scale Layer 1s like Bitcoin and Ethereum by improving throughput and reducing transaction fees, protocols like Union enable both\u2014interoperability at scale.\n\nThe need for blockchain interoperability\n\nWhatever your opinion on the WEF, its 2020 whitepaper on blockchain interoperability hit the nail when it stated, \u201cOrganisations do not want to find themselves on a blockchain platform that may limit their options for external collaboration in the future.\u201d\n\nTo elaborate further on that point, imagine having a Gmail account, sending a message to a Yahoo account, and being unable to exchange communications. The internet was able to develop as quickly as it did because it factored in interoperability from the early days, and blockchains must do the same.\n\nA notable player in the interoperability space is Cosmos, whose flagship Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol has enabled a host of sovereign chains to connect, transact, exchange, swap tokens, and perform other actions without compromising sovereignty. Map of Zones shows 91 zones now connected via IBC transacting more than $2.1 billion over the last 30 days in more than 8.7 million transactions.\n\nIBC isn\u2019t limited to Cosmos chains, either. The trustless interoperability protocol has broadened its scope to include EVM-compatible chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. However, most bridging solutions so far have been offered by centralized providers, meaning users must trust the bridging protocol.\n\nUnion provides a permissionless bridging protocol that connects modular blockchains and rollups trustlessly, without depending on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or MPC, using advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography.\n\nAlready connecting several ecosystems, Union recently announced a partnership with L2 developer Polygon Labs that will tap into Polygon\u2019s AggLayer \u201cto facilitate message passing and asset transfers between the Polygon ecosystem and IBC-enabled chains,\u201d bridging two of the largest blockchain ecosystems: Polygon and Cosmos.\n\nPermissionlessly bridging Polygon, Cosmos, and beyond\n\nUnion founder and prior CTO at Composable Finance Karel Kubat told CryptoSlate, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a Cosmos to Polygon bridge but anything that\u2019s IBC-enabled, which includes Scroll, and soon Arbitrum, Berrachain, Movement Labs, M2\u2026 They can build and connect into the Agglayer using Union,\u201d permissionlessly tapping into the liquidity of one of the largest blockchain Layer 1s, Ethereum.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s very interesting because we have big L1 ecosystems that really only have permissioned centralized bridges or something in between. You need to go to the bridge provider to get support for a small ecosystem. What Union does, is if you\u2019re building a new Cosmos chain or a new rollup that\u2019s IBC enabled, you don\u2019t need to go to a centralized provider to get support. You just open the connection to Ethereum and you\u2019re done\u2026 So we\u2019re going quite quickly from a world with only 200 to 300 ecosystems to a world with thousands and thousands.\u201d\n\nThis type of seamless interoperability isn\u2019t possible with centralized solutions because the \u201cwait queue\u201d is too long. Every chain wanting to connect needs to request the bridging protocol\u2019s permission.\n\nWith Union, chains can permissionlessly open a channel with Ethereum, enabling a seamlessly interconnected future\u2026 of potentially millions of chains. Karel gives the example of dYdX, one of the largest decentralized exchanges that began as a smart contract on Ethereum and moved ecosystems to become a sovereign Cosmos app chain.\n\n\u201cWe all went into crypto for sovereignty,\u201d he says. \u201cAny successful smart contract is contemplating going to their own L2 or app chain.\u201d This means the total addressable market for Union is potentially vast. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone that wants to build a blockchain. It\u2019s any existing app on Ethereum and Solana that could benefit from making this move.\u201d\n\nUnion\u2019s IBC to Polygon bridge should be completed by the end of this year and you can keep up with the latest developments by following Union on X.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why Is ETH Price Falling Despite SEC Approving All Spot Ethereum ETFs? | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has failed to make any significant rally following the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. This is undoubtedly surprising, given that the approval was expected to spark a massive price surge for the second-largest crypto token.\n\nWhy ETH\u2019s Price Has Failed To Rally\n\nEthereum\u2019s price may have failed to rally because the crypto token was already priced into the news about a potential approval. It is worth noting that ETH\u2019S price rallied by almost 20% earlier this week when Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their approval odds from 25% to 75%, suggesting that approval was almost likely.\n\nTherefore, this could have turned out to be a typical \u2018sell the news\u2019 event, with many traders currently taking profits from their earlier ETH investments. NewsBTC reported that Ethereum whales had bought over 110,000 ETH ($341 million) between May 19 and 20 as they positioned themselves ahead of any news regarding a potential approval of these funds.\n\nMeanwhile, historically speaking, this could have been expected from ETH\u2019s price, considering that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant drawdown following the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that unlike the Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading immediately, these Spot Ethereum ETFs won\u2019t start trading just yet. The SEC only approved the exchange filings (19b-4s) and will still have to approve the registration filings (S-1s) for these funds to begin trading.\n\nThe fact these Ethereum ETFs won\u2019t begin trading just yet could be another reason why ETH\u2019S price hasn\u2019t reacted positively to this development. As such, approval of the registration filings, which may take weeks or months, may be needed to spark another rally for Ethereum and other altcoins by extension.\n\nA key positive is that ETH is up by over 28% in the last seven days, which is a big deal considering that the crypto token has lagged for a while now and failed to match up with other major-cap crypto tokens.\n\nAnother Reason To Be Bullish On Ethereum\n\nThe approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs is a clear indication that the SEC doesn\u2019t consider ETH a security, contrary to earlier reports that the Commission might have held this belief for some time now.\n\nTuongVy Le, a General Counsel at Anchorage Digital, noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that funds whose assets are 40% or more securities may not register through a form S-1 but through Form N-1A or N-2.\n\nTherefore, if the SEC considered ETH a security, it would have rejected the S-1 filings made by the various fund issuers like BlackRock since these Ethereum ETFs will hold ETH as their major assets.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,803, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com"

This signifies renewed investor interest in ETH, meaning it may see less sideways movement in the coming days.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nIf renewed confidence prevails, ETH could attempt to break the $3,161 resistance and, if successful, move past the $3,251 mark. However, it's important to watch out for volatility in the days leading up to the SEC's decision on spot ETH ETFs on May 23."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap entered a fresh rally in mid-week and rebounded from $2860 monthly support. This renewed buying interest bolstered by the Bitcoin price jump to $67000 on Friday has surged the ETH price to an 8.7% gain. However, an analysis of the daily chart shows the rising Ether price is heading to a crucial resistance indicating an upcoming pivot momentum for this asset.\n\nAlso Read: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Charts Might Turn Bullish Now: ETH Targets $4k?\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Poised for Rebound as Falling Channel Pattern Nears Break\n\nIn the daily time frame chart, the Ethereum price shows the formation of a falling channel pattern. The two parallel trendlines acting as dynamic resistance and support have plunged the ETH value from $4084 to $2864 support indicating a nearly 30% loss.\n\nWhile the BTC price rally bolsters a new recovery sentiment in altcoin, the ETH price could remain trapped in a correction until the chart setup is intact.\n\nHaving said that, the Ether coin is heading higher to challenge the upper boundary of the Channel pattern.

The accompanying chart from CryptoQuant illustrates the growth rate difference between Bitcoin\u2019s market cap and realized cap, showing similar cycles approximately every two years.\n\nThis potential uptrend significantly influences the altcoin market bolstering top assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP to lead to higher rallies.\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the channel pattern will accelerate the buying momentum and assist buyers in rechallenging the $4080 high.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The dynamic resistance of the 50-day EMA prevents the ETH price from breaching the channel pattern.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The ADX slope falling below 18% hints the prevailing bearish momentum is weakening.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Predicting how ETH will react IF the SEC approves Ethereum ETFs - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Coinbase analyst sees a 30-40% chance of approval for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s dominance and performance are at a low, suggesting a need for positive development soon.\n\nIt is generally believed that the U.S. SEC will not approve any applications for the spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF due to several factors pointing to the fact that the agency\u2019s new crypto enemy is Ethereum.\n\nBut still, no real confirmation has been gotten from the agency itself on what it\u2019s planning. So there is still a chance, no matter how slim, that the SEC would approve these ETFs.\n\nHowever, if they do, is the market ready for that impact? How would Ethereum\u2019s price react?\n\nApproval odds for Ethereum ETFs\n\nCoinbase institutional research analyst David Han suggests there could be a surprising upside.\n\nIn Coinbase\u2019s monthly outlook report published on the 15th of May, Han mentioned that the odds of approval are between 30-40%.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has similarly set his approval odds at 35%. Meanwhile, the crypto community took a survey from Polymarket and the general estimate is 7% odds of approval.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, echoed the somewhat optimistic sentiment during an appearance on CNBC, saying that the SEC might approve spot ETH ETFs even if it does consider Ethereum a security\n\nWhat does the data tell us?\n\nShould the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF, the market could see an unexpected surge. However, Ethereum\u2019s dominance and recent performance are trending toward their lowest point ever.\n\nIts SEC-proclaimed status as a security has negatively impacted investment sentiment.\n\nNo one expects an approval, so Ether prices could likely see very little action in the near future.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] price hardly reacted to its ETF approvals earlier this year. And the community were actually looking forward to it.\n\nRecently, the Funding Rate has been relatively low or negative, which could imply a cooling off of bullish momentum or increased caution among traders, especially during price dips as it happened in mid-April.\n\nMoreover, the increase in Open Interest despite lower trading volumes suggests that traders might be preparing for significant price moves ahead, as positions are being built up.\n\nBut Ethereum\u2019s trading chart shows a consistent bullish trend over a two-day period. The highest price point just above $3,160 could act as a short-term resistance level.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nWatching how the price reacts upon retesting this level could be critical for short-term investment strategies.\n\nGiven the strong upward momentum and successful price recovery post-retraction, if the market maintains its bullish sentiment, Ethereum could potentially break through the current resistance level."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s most recent run continued in the past 24 hours as the asset\u2019s price climbed to its highest price in over a month at just over $67,400 yesterday.\n\nEthereum has also joined the party at last, having surged past the coveted resistance line of $3,000 and jumping above $3,100.\n\nBTC Sees 5-Week Peak\n\nBitcoin suffered a lot at the start of May as it dumped to a multi-month low of under $57,000. It began to recover some ground in the following week when it soared past $65,000 on May 6 but quickly reversed its trajectory and saw its price dropping to under $61,000 on May 10.\n\nThe bulls intercepted the move at this point and didn\u2019t allow any further declines. Just the opposite, BTC maintained its ground last weekend and started climbing on Monday to just over $63,000. Another brief correction came on Tuesday to $61,200, but the lowering inflation rates in the US, which were announced on Wednesday, sent the cryptocurrency flying.\n\nIn a matter of hours, BTC skyrocketed by several grand and jumped past $66,000. Although there was another brief retracement, the growing Bitcoin ETF inflows meant more price gains for the underlying asset, which charted a 5-week high of over $67,400 yesterday.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets. Start receiving this recap, for free, every day: Invalid email address Your privacy is guranteed. Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!\n\nDespite losing some ground since then, BTC still trades around $67,000 now. Its market cap has increased to $1.320 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts is slightly down to 51.6%.\n\nETH Goes Beyond $3.1K\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency was among those who trailed behind in terms of gains, as reported earlier and was losing ground to BTC. This was because ETH couldn\u2019t reclaim decisively $3,000 despite several challenges in the past few weeks.\n\nHowever, that resistance level finally gave in yesterday, which allowed Ether to shoot up above $3,100 for the first time in over a week.\n\nMost other larger-cap alts are also in the green, with gains of around 1-2%. In contrast, Toncoin has retraced by more than 3%, and so has HEAR, which is down by 4%.\n\nThe total crypto market cap has added around $20 billion overnight and is now at $2.560 trillion on CG."

        "title": "Could Investing $10,000 in Solana Make You a Millionaire? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Could Ethereum's rival generate major multibagger gains?\n\nSolana (SOL -1.70%) has minted a lot of millionaires since its launch in 2020. The cryptocurrency started trading at $0.95 and hit its all-time high of $260.06 on Nov. 6, 2021 -- which would have turned a $10,000 investment into $2.74 million.\n\nSolana was widely seen as an alternative to Ethereum (ETH -0.02%) for the development of decentralized apps. Solana's blockchain was faster, more scalable, and had lower transaction costs than Ethereum. It accomplished that by using its unique proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism to accelerate the proof-of-stake (PoS) mining method used by Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a series of network congestion and security failures caused Solana to lose its luster, and rising rates subsequently crushed the cryptocurrency market. To make matters worse, failed crypto exchange FTX hastily liquidated its Solana tokens in several huge auctions to raise more cash to pay off its creditors. As a result, Solana's price dipped below $10 by the end of 2022.\n\nYet Solana bounced back, reaching $163; your original $10,000 investment would still be worth $1.72 million. It was tough for investors to stick with Solana through those wild swings, but it's now the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $71 billion. Could it keep growing and turn a fresh $10,000 investment to $1 million again?\n\nWhat's next for Solana?\n\nSolana's powerful recovery suggests it will remain a formidable rival for Ethereum as a platform for the development of decentralized apps and tokens. Its network has already been used to produce a wide range of meme coins, including notable ones like BONK (BONK 5.68%) and WIF (WIF 2.21%), as well as decentralized exchanges like Jupiter and Orca. The expansion of that ecosystem could make it a fertile environment for more crypto projects.\n\nNew decentralized wallets and financial apps could also help Solana (and Ethereum) disrupt traditional financial institutions. The introduction of Solana Pay, which was integrated into Shopify last year, marked a major step in that direction. Visa also started to run its stablecoin settlement program on Solana, while Circle recently added native Solana support for its EURC stablecoin.\n\nSolana Labs' subsidiary, Solana Mobile, even launched its own Saga smartphone last December. The Android device is still a niche gadget, but it targets Web3 enthusiasts with its integrated digital asset management and Solana blockchain tools.\n\nSolana's rapid expansion is impressive, but Ethereum is scrambling to match Solana's speed and scalability with its own network upgrades. In a recent essay, Ethereum's co-founder and chief architect, Vitalik Buterin, proposed the introduction of \"multidimensional gas fees\" which sound similar to Solana's variable project-by-project user fees across its \"local fee markets.\" If Ethereum closes that gap, it could throttle the long-term growth of Solana's blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow much higher can Solana soar?\n\nSolana seems to have overcome its initial growing pains. It resolved the congestion issues caused by the market's feverish interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021, survived FTX's large liquidations, and still processes transactions faster than Ethereum. Developers are still launching new apps on Solana and promoting their new tokens with airdrops.\n\nHowever, it's tough to tell how much larger Solana's blockchain can grow as long as it's overshadowed by Ethereum's larger network. For now, CoinPedia estimates that Solana's price could hit $500 by the end of the year and $1,672 by 2030.\n\nYou should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they imply that Solana will remain one of the world's top cryptocurrencies as it attracts more developers and becomes more widely adopted for mainstream payments. But even if Solana's price hits $1,672 by 2030, it would only turn a new $10,000 investment into about $100,000.\n\nTherefore, Solana might still have a lot of upside potential -- but it probably won't make you a millionaire by the end of the decade. It could also easily be cut in half before it generates bigger gains, so investors should brace for a lot of volatility."

At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,108.31 with a market capitalization of over $373 billion.\n\nThe bullish price action had a positive impact on the token\u2019s social metrics, as its Social Volume remained high last week.\n\nIts Weighted Sentiment also entered the positive zone, meaning the bullish sentiment around ETH became dominant in the market.\n\nThanks to the price uptick, ETH broke above a bullish pattern that hinted at a price rise towards $4k.\n\nWorld Of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting that ETH broke out of a falling wedge pattern.\n\nThe pattern appeared on ETH\u2019s chart during the beginning of March, and since then, ETH has consolidated inside it.\n\nThe tweet mentioned that the breakout could result in a 50% price rise, in turn allowing Ethereum to reclaim $4k once again.\n\nWhat to expect in the short term?\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s metrics to see whether they support the possibility of it touching $4k anytime soon.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was low compared to the last seven days\u2019 average, signifying less selling pressure.\n\nAnother positive metric was the Coinbase premium, as it indicated that buying sentiment was dominant among U.S. investors. However, not everything looked bullish for the king of altcoins.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a sharp uptick. A rise in the metric suggests that an asset is overvalued, hinting at a price decline.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also indicated a possible price correction as the indicator registered a decline. Nonetheless, the MACD displayed a bullish crossover.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also supported the bulls as it went northward.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nTo see what targets it might reach if its bull rally sustains, AMBCrypto analyzed Hyblock Capital\u2019s data. We found that ETH\u2019s liquidation would rise near the $3.2k zone.\n\nA successful breakout above that would allow it to reach $3.5k in the coming days before it targets $4k. However, if ETH\u2019s price turns bearish, then its value might plummet to $2.85k."

This approach has successfully captivated investors, culminating in a substantial $28.3 million in presale.\n\nThe platform\u2019s innovative dashboard, which includes features like current rankings and a leaderboard, provides critical insights and encourages competitive interaction among users. In contrast, Ethereum faces uncertain price predictions, and Polkadot continues to develop its smart contract capabilities. These elements position BlockDAG as a premier Layer 1 cryptocurrency with significant return potential.\n\nEthereum Faces Price Instability Amid Market Trends\n\nEthereum (ETH) is trading at $2,904, marking a slight decline over the past day. Ethereum remains trapped within a bearish pattern despite some bullish attempts, potentially indicating further drops. From a recent high of $4,000 in March, Ethereum has fallen by 31%, with the price stabilizing around $2,870\u2014a critical support level now contested by bulls and bears.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum remains uncertain as both the 50-day exponential moving average and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) appear to lean toward a bearish sentiment. A break below $2,870 could depress prices to $2,800 or even $2,200, making it crucial for investors to watch these levels closely.\n\nPolkadot Advances with New Smart Contracts\n\nPolkadot is enhancing its blockchain framework by integrating smart contracts through the ink! language, which facilitates the creation of robust, DOT-compatible applications. This move is set to tackle one of Polkadot\u2019s significant limitations and drive its platform forward. With the Pop Network\u2019s solution already operational on the Paseo testnet, Polkadot is preparing for its next development phase, including features to improve network efficiency and scalability.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s Dashboard and Roadmap Accelerate Market Impact\n\nBlockDAG's updated dashboard provides many features that enhance user interaction and offer valuable insights. Users can view their current ranking and the necessary purchases to advance, fostering a competitive spirit through a leaderboard that showcases top investors. Additional tools like transaction previews, referral tracking, and detailed personal profiles simplify investment tracking and enhance user engagement.\n\nMoreover, BlockDAG's ambitious roadmap is meticulously laid out in four distinct phases: initial development, expansion through strategic partnerships, the launch sequence, and finally, the closing of the presale leading to the mainnet launch. A key highlight of this roadmap is the X1 Miner app, designed to be user-friendly with functionalities such as a wallet, send/receive options, and a performance leaderboard. The app is geared towards easing the mining process and enhancing community involvement with dedicated sections for user interaction and streamlined onboarding.\n\nThese enhancements to the dashboard and roadmap have greatly appealed to investors, propelling the presale quickly through its phases. In Batch 13, priced at $0.008, the presale has successfully raised $28.3 million, demonstrating strong investor trust and the potential for significant returns.\n\nBlockDAG Sets a High Standard in the Crypto Market\n\nWhile Ethereum struggles with price volatility and Polkadot develops its smart contract infrastructure, BlockDAG is making significant strides with its innovative dashboard and comprehensive roadmap. These developments not only boost user engagement but also enhance BlockDAG's investment appeal, positioning it above established players like Ethereum and Polkadot. With a robust $28.3 million presale and over 9.2 billion BDAG coins sold, BlockDAG offers a promising investment opportunity in the blockchain space, poised for substantial future growth.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Now!\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

Buterin claimed that Ethereum does not stop its community members or any members of the public from speaking their minds on any matter.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2026\u2026..even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem,\u201d Ethereum co-founder added.\n\nWhile the concept of \u201copen discourse\u201d may not mean much to some sects, Buterin highlighted that others take it seriously. Noteworthy, Vitalik\u2019s statement does not appear to be a direct jab at any protocol but it suggests that he might have discovered a trend amongst digital assets ecosystems.\n\nProbably a case of some self-acclaimed top developers downplaying the opinion of their community members or that of \u201csmaller\u201d developers. The statement from Vitalik Buterin mirrors his stance on the matter of free speech and Ethereum\u2019s part in achieving it.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder never fails to laud the capabilities of the ecosystem or its superseding performance over its counterparts. Only a few days ago, he unveiled a groundbreaking proposal aimed at addressing the pressing challenges faced by the Ethereum network.\n\nIn one of his articles, Buterin advocated for the adoption of \u2018Multidimensional Gas Pricing,\u2019 a concept designed to revolutionize the management of network resources. He believes that Ethereum can enhance efficiency and scalability by pricing different resources separately.\n\nHe sees the capacity for this addition to pave the way for a more robust and sustainable network infrastructure. This was after Buterin requested that quantum resistance, a new proposal that will bring longer-term sustainability to the protocol\u2019s smart contract push, be added to Ethereum.\n\nCrypto Community Expects Spot ETH ETF Decision\n\nDespite these multiple developments and advancement, Ethereum is still facing regulatory challenges with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Chairman of the Commission Gary Gensler has remain fixated on categorizing the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap as security.\n\nThis classification seem to have negatively impacted on the possibility of receiving approval for the spot Ethereum ETF applications made by top investment asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nWith a mix of optimism and pessimism, the broad crypto community have their fingers crossed waiting patiently for May 23rd, the decision date for VanEck as scheduled by the SEC.\n\nRead More: XRP Lawsuit: Pro-XRP Lawyer Reveals Dates For Lawsuit Conclusion\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "title": "Ethereum nears $3,200, jumps 10%: Bullish breakout ahead? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH wants to break above resistance.\n\nThe bulls supported the coin\u2019s uptrend with a number of markers spotted on a daily chart.\n\nLeading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] is poised to breach the upper line of its descending channel, suggesting a decline in selling pressure.\n\nAt $3,100 at press time, the coin\u2019s value has risen by almost 10% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap. This growth mirrored the uptick in the general crypto market in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged by 9% during that period.\n\nWill ETH make it?\n\nA descending channel is formed when an asset\u2019s price continues to make lower highs and lower lows, indicating a broader downward trend.\n\nETH began to trend within this channel on the 12th of March, causing its price to decline by 20% since then.\n\nWith the coin making its way toward the upper line of the channel, which has formed a resistance level since March, the market witnessed a surge in new liquidity inflow.\n\nConfirming this was ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow, which recently crossed above the zero line and was in an uptrend at press time. This indicator measures the flow of money into and out of the coin\u2019s market.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s CMF climbs this way, it suggests more buying pressure than selling pressure in the market. This is often due to the asset\u2019s price making new highs because of a surge in trading volume.\n\nIn the last seven days, ETH\u2019s daily trading volume has risen by 40%, per Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nSignaling the rise in bullish presence, ETH\u2019s positive directional index (green) crossed above its negative index (red) on the 17th of May.\n\nSuch readings made from an asset\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicate a bullish rise in the market.\n\nFurther, the value of the coin\u2019s Elder-Ray Index was positive at press time.\n\nThis indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market. When it returns a positive value, it means that bull power dominates the market.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nShould ETH bulls succeed and break above the upper line of the descending channel, the coin\u2019s next price point will be above $3200.\n\nHowever, if selling pressure mounts and a downtrend is initiated, the price is expected to fall to $2775 toward support."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s transaction size falls 54%: Why it\u2019s not bad news for ETH - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH could be close to its bottom after the transaction size failed to spike.\n\nWhile the price might slip, traders are convinced of a quick recovery.\n\nOn the 19th of May, AMBCrypto observed that Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] average transaction size had fallen to $2,767. This was a 54.13% decline from the metric when the month began.\n\nAt that time, the average transaction size was $5,893, according to data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the average transaction size checks in dollar terms the mean transaction value for an asset on a particular day.\n\nHistorically, spikes in this metric signal high user activity\u2014Especially from large investors and institutions. But when it decreases, it implies an absence of institutional interaction.\n\nInstitutions out, retail in\n\nAs such, the recent state of Ethereum implies a presence of more retail users. Apart from that, this indicator identifies potential tops and bottoms.\n\nFrom the value mentioned, it was obvious that ETH seemed closer to its bottom than the top. At press time, ETH\u2019s price was $3,106, indicating that it had swung around the same range in the last 24 hours.\n\nGoing by the analysis above, the price of the cryptocurrency could be set to hit a higher value in the short term. However, other metrics need to be considered.\n\nAs a result of this, AMBCrypto looked at the Ethereum Exchange Net Position Change. According to data obtained from Glassnode, the Exchange Net Position Change has been in the negative region for most of the last 30 days.\n\nETH gets set for a big move\n\nThis metric tracks the 30-day change of the supply held in exchange wallets. A positive value indicates that more coins are in exchanges.\n\nOn the other hand, a negative value indicates increased withdrawals from exchanges.\n\nOne thing we noticed was that the metric suddenly became positive on the 18th of May. As of this writing, the ETH net position change was 81,715.\n\nThis increase could be a sign that Ethereum participants are taking profits off the 6.50% increase within the last week.\n\nIf this number continues to increase, then ETH\u2019s price might decrease below $3,000 before the potential rally happens.\n\nHowever, if exchange withdrawals intensify once more, the price might begin a slow increase toward $3,500. In a highly bullish situation, an increase to $4,000 could be an option.\n\nOn Friday, the 17th of May, AMBCrypto reported how options traders were expecting ETH\u2019s price to hit $3,600 between May and the end of June.\n\nAt press time, Glassnode data showed that the sentiment had not changed. This is because of the signals from the Put/Call Ratio (PCR).\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nIf the PCR is over 0.70, it implies a bearish sentiment and there are more puts than calls.\n\nHowever, a reading below 0.50 implies otherwise. At press time, Ethereum\u2019s Put/Call Ratio was 0.35, meaning that most traders expect the value of the cryptocurrency to increase in the coming weeks."

        "title": "Arbitrum beats Polygon in key area: What\u2019s next for the Ethereum L2 rivals? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Another whale bought ARB tokens worth $6.15 million while MATIC did not attract such investment.\n\nNew unique transactions on Arbitrum were more than those on Polygon.\n\nIf the kind of accumulation Arbitrum [ARB] has experienced within the last few months, then another Ethereum L2 like Polygon [MATIC] might need to be wary.\n\nA few times, AMBCrypto reported how investors purchased ARB in large numbers. While the activity slowed down at some point, another accumulation resurfaced on the 17th of May.\n\nAccording to Arbiscan, a whale bought 4.17 million ARB on the mentioned date. This same buyer has been purchasing the token since July 2023.\n\nIn total, the participants hold $6.15 million worth of the token despite offloading some previously.\n\nBoth tokens fall, but one has the upper hand\n\nPurchases like this suggest conviction in the long-term performance of the token. This is something Polygon has struggled to experience.\n\nWhen it comes to the price, MATIC has lost 29.23% of its value on a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis. ARB was however worse off\u2014 Registering a 40.86% decrease within the same period.\n\nHowever, consistency in ARB accumulation could change the state of things. If this is the case, the Polygon native token might begin to lag behind the Arbitrum governance cryptocurrency.\n\nBeyond the price, other aspects of the individual ecosystems give insights into their potential future performances. First off, AMBCrypto compared the network growth.\n\nThis metric shows the number of new addresses making transactions on the network. At press time, Arbitrum\u2019s network growth was 1526.\n\nFor Polygon, it was 225. The significant difference was proof that market participants were flocking to Arbitrum. However, Polygon has not achieved much in convincing new entrants to transact using MATIC.\n\nIf this continues, ARB\u2019s price might experience a good level of appreciation. Furthermore, the token has been able to surpass the $1 landmark.\n\nFor many months, ARB struggled to revisit the region. By the look of things, the price of cryptocurrency might rise higher than this.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that it would be easy to hit the $2.39 all-time high it reached in March.\n\nCan Arbitrum\u2019s market cap jump 3x?\n\nDespite the potential Arbitrum showed, it might find it hard to flip Polygon\u2019s market cap. As of this writing, Arbitrum\u2019s market cap was $2.72 billion.\n\nPolygon, on the other hand, was triple at $7.12 billion. For ARB to hit such heights, the price has to move past $3.50. But that would require MATIC to stall below $1.\n\nGoing by our analysis, Arbitrum might continue to outpace Polygon in terms of transactions. Also, this could fuel an improved performance than MATIC.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ARB\u2019s market cap in MATIC terms\n\nIn the long term, the price of ARB and MATIC could depend on Ethereum since both are L2s of the blockchain.\n\nIf ETH price pumps, most likely, ARB and the Polygon native token would jump. On the other hand, a decrease in ETH\u2019s value could trigger a plunge in the prices of the tokens."
