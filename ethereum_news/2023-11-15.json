        "title": "Ethereum won\u2019t flip Bitcoin anytime soon, but Ordinals could change that - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin block space looks set to be the hottest commodity in crypto.\n\nBitcoin once again occupies more than half the entire crypto market, having outperformed ether by nearly double so far in 2023. Now, the long-prophesied \u201cflippening\u201d of ether over bitcoin is even further in the future.\n\nThe market currently values Bitcoin three times higher than Ethereum. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, at $727 billion, has swelled by $400 billion in 2023 \u2014 a figure bigger than Mastercard\u2019s entire stock valuation and about twice that of Netflix\u2019s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s valuation has grown by $100 billion, jumping from under $145 billion in January to nearly $245 billion today.\n\nSome anticipate that Ethereum\u2019s market cap will one day eclipse Bitcoin\u2019s, despite the latter\u2019s half-decade head start.\n\nThings were looking good coming out of the 2019 bear market and into 2021\u2019s explosive bull cycle. DeFi summer and NFT mania boosted interest in Ethereum, at times driving up fees for certain actions beyond $250.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s market value was 925% of Ethereum\u2019s \u2014 $130 billion to $14 billion \u2014 at the end of 2019 (bottom of the bear market).\n\nThat figure had shrunk to under 200% by the end of 2021 (peak bull market).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value is now 300% of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThe Bitcoin rally has widened the gap\n\nThe case for flippening has recently taken a hit by a different flip: The Bitcoin network now rakes in more fees than Ethereum for the first time since December 2020.\n\nOver the past four days, Bitcoin users have paid miners about $40 million to have their transactions processed.\n\nEthereum users, meanwhile, forked out less than $27 million ether (most of those fees have been burned, slightly reducing Ethereum\u2019s overall supply).\n\nLayer-2 Ethereum networks Arbitrum and Optimism haven\u2019t bridged that gap as they each generate less than $200,000 in fees per day right now.\n\nThe fee-flippening (flee-pening?) is awkward when you consider the sheer amount of use cases supported by Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges, DAOs, memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, DeFi and GameFi all run atop Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Justin Drake is unconcerned despite ether\u2019s middling year pricewise: Q&A\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, had for the longest time mostly had one application \u2014 bitcoin transactions. But the rate of on-chain transactions had until recently sustained very little growth since 2015. Perhaps due to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative and the rising ubiquity of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nOver the past five years, Ethereum users have paid $17 billion in fees, Bitcoin users just $2.9 billion\n\nAll that changed with Ordinals \u2014 a protocol for inscribing individual units of bitcoin (BTC) with unique data to create digital collectibles, first launched in January.\n\nMusic, text, art, video and even code for browser-based DOOM clones have since been inscribed to Bitcoin, resulting in an on-chain collectibles market worth thousands of BTC. Bitcoin users trade Ordinals as Ethereum or Solana users would trade NFTs.\n\nToday, anywhere from around a third to one half of Bitcoin transactions contain Ordinals, driving up demand for blockspace as well as transaction fees. At times today, \u201cmedium priority\u201d transactions went for around $11 compared to around $2.30 for the same on Ethereum (more priority generally means faster processing), although those prices have since come down.\n\nTron comes in third overall for monthly fees, mostly thanks to stablecoin Tether\n\nSo is Bitcoin netting more fees than Ethereum good for Bitcoin? Maybe not.\n\nSome Bitcoin insiders worry the network isn\u2019t properly equipped to handle Ordinals and potential influxes of interest in its original use case, BTC payments.\n\nThe CryptoKitties incident in December 2017 \u2014 during which a NFT game grew so popular that it spectacularly clogged Ethereum \u2014 first showed that Ethereum probably couldn\u2019t handle serving as the \u201cWorld Computer\u201d just yet.\n\nThen, the 2021 bull market saw NFT mint costs soar to $250 at times \u2014 a reminder of how necessary it was to port activity to smaller chains, including rollups. Still, memecoins and low quality token projects ratcheted up fees beyond $20 earlier this year, drastically reducing Ethereum\u2019s usefulness for non-critical tasks.\n\nThe NFT craze of 2021 made Ethereum block space the hottest commodity in crypto. Even while tanking its utility.\n\nOrdinals may end up having the same effect on Bitcoin, especially if demand keeps up and the bull market truly hits.\n\nAt that point, it would seem reasonable to value Bitcoin and Ethereum more similarly. It might just take another run.\n\nUpdated Nov. 16, 2023 at 4:25 pm ET: Corrected reference to percentages in bullet points.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What Is Validium in Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Validium is an innovative addition to the suite of scaling solutions helping to solve Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges.\n\nValidium is a protocol that was introduced to improve scalability issues on the Ethereum network. In this guide, we look at what Validium is, how it works, and its benefits and challenges.\n\nWhat Is Validium?\n\nValidium is a Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to verify off-chain transactions. Its primary goal is to enhance the scalability, privacy, and security of the Ethereum network.\n\nAt the solution\u2019s core are sidechains or L2 solutions linked to but handling transactions separately from the Ethereum main chain. In this way, they move transactions off-chain and help ease transactional pressure on the Ethereum network.\n\nConsequently, users can enjoy faster confirmation times while moving more volumes. Furthermore, Validium significantly reduces gas fees due to the reduced computational overhead, as it doesn\u2019t need to verify every transaction individually.\n\nHow Does Validium Work?\n\nValidium bundles sidechain transactions into batches and generates zk-proofs for each batch. Zk-proofs ensure the validity of the transactions and that the off-chain chain has been updated correctly.\n\nEvery sidechain has a validator responsible for aggregating transactions and generating zk-proofs, which are then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet for verification.\n\nIf the proof is valid, the verifiers update the mainnet record to reflect the changes that occurred in the sidechain.\n\nUse Cases and Applications of Validium in Ethereum\n\nValidium has several potential use cases and applications within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi protocols can use Validium to improve their efficiency and usability. For example, they can adopt the technology to create faster DeFi investment platforms with lower gas fees. This efficiency broadens the platform\u2019s accessibility and enhances the user experience.\n\nGaming and NFTs\n\nValidium solutions can facilitate seamless in-game transactions and interactions with NFT marketplaces due to their low fees and faster confirmation times. This provides gamers and collectors with more enjoyable experiences.\n\nSupply Chain Management\n\nThrough Validium, manufacturers can set up more efficient and transparent supply chain management systems. They can track their consignments off-chain easily and cost-efficiently without overloading the blockchain with data.\n\nKey Benefits of Validium in Ethereum\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the key benefits Validium brings to Ethereum.\n\nEnhanced Scalability\n\nValidium can process thousands of transactions per second (tps), compared to the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s 15-25 tps. This feature makes it ideal for high-throughput applications like decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. Increased throughputs are crucial to Ethereum adoption as they guarantee timely transactions.\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\nValidium uses zk-proofs to verify transactions by allowing one party to prove to another party that they know something without revealing what the thing they know is. As such, zk-proofs provide an elevated level of security for transactions, ensuring that validators cannot cheat or steal user funds. Additionally, Validium improves privacy by excluding sensitive user data from the public Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLower Transaction Fees\n\nReduced computational overhead makes Validium settlements significantly cheaper than mainnet ones. This is a major benefit for users, making Ethereum more affordable.\n\nFaster Transaction Speeds\n\nDue to its off-chain processing, Validium operations are much faster than those on the mainnet. This is important for applications that require fast and reliable transactions, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms.\n\nChallenges and Limitations of Validium\n\nDespite its benefits, Validium also has some challenges and limitations.\n\nCentralization of the Network\n\nUsers must trust the validator to process transactions correctly. This could lead to centralization concerns, as few validators could control a sizable portion of the network. Introducing a trusted third party contradicts the decentralization philosophy of cryptocurrencies.\n\nInteroperability and Compatibility\n\nIntegrating Validium with existing Ethereum smart contracts and protocols can be challenging due to potential data structure incompatibilities. Ethereum developers are working on ways to ensure seamless interaction between the mainnet and its sidechains.\n\nDependence on Data Providers\n\nThe technology relies on data providers to make off-chain data available. This dependence on them introduces an element of trust that runs counter to decentralization, a central tenet of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHaving external data providers also puts the data processed on the network at risk of hacking or unauthorized access by malicious parties.\n\nConclusion\n\nValidium is important in Ethereum\u2019s journey toward scalability. Its ability to significantly improve transaction speeds, lower costs, and streamline operations is poised to redefine the network\u2019s experience, with many developers seeking to integrate it into their products."

        "title": "Former advisor Steven Nerayoff hypes Ethereum scandal expos\u00e9 - Protos",
        "content": "Ethereum whistleblowers Steven Nerayoff and TruthLabs have alleged numerous incidents of misconduct by early Ethereum insiders, with Nerayoff currently teasing the release of apparently never-before-heard audio recordings of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nNerayoff is promising to reveal scandalous evidence that he believes proves that Buterin copied his idea of issuing utility tokens via ICOs. He is also threatening to sue over his supposed invention.\n\nOf course, fraud by third-party creators who simply used the Ethereum platform to create scam tokens or NFTs is nothing new. Many Ethereum ICO fundraisers during the 2017-2018 craze turned out to be doomed. Indeed, most ICOs have fallen to near-$0.\n\nSimilarly, most NFTs are now worthless. Ethereum insiders, however, are not responsible for those scams.\n\nWhat is new, however, is the fact that Steven Nerayoff and an unrelated researcher, TruthLabs, have both alleged misconduct by Ethereum founders and their allies and want to release the supposedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nRead more: These six-figure NFTs are down 99%\n\nSteven Nerayoff: Baffling yet impossible to ignore\n\nNerayoff makes sweeping claims that are often difficult to understand, yet he does speak with some authority. He was a former legal advisor to the Ethereum Foundation. He claims that Vitalik Buterin once lived with him in New York and worked in an office that Nerayoff rented for the benefit of Ethereum.\n\nSome observers used to dismiss most of Nerayoff\u2019s claims due to his personal credibility taking a hit when the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged him with criminal extortion in 2019. However, a New York judge dismissed that charge in May 2023, cleaning up his reputation considerably.\n\nAlthough Nerayoff has posted his recent, Ethereum-related claims to X, he says his legal team is working on organizing all the documents involved to substantiate his new claims. Curiously, he claims to have created a non-X platform to ostensibly ensure that the information he publishes will not be censored.\n\nOn November 14, he promised to publish specific allegations against Ethereum insiders \u201cwithin 48 hours, hopefully less.\u201d There have, however, been delays, with Nerayoff claiming that logistics and the creation of NFTs were responsible for most of the hold-ups.\n\nShould be within 48 hours hopefully less. Logistics, setting up Smart NFTs, etc. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nDid Vitalik Buterin ask Nerayoff to rescue the Ethereum Foundation?\n\nNerayoff claims that one of his upcoming NFTs will include a 2015 recording of Vitalik Buterin asking Nerayoff for a \u201crescue plan\u201d for the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nA transcript of Nerayoff\u2019s appearance on one of Mario Nawfal\u2019s \u201cTwitter Spaces\u201d indicates that the NFT will include audio asking Nerayoff to help restructure the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nGreat thread @CoinpediaNews . The NFT isn\u2019t about fraud it\u2019s a recording of a rescue plan to save Ethereum Vitalik asked me to create in 2015. It\u2019s a rare unedited historical view into what was really happening & crucial decisions made or not made which shaped much of crypto. https://t.co/4paTF5fseI \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nThis continues Nerayoff\u2019s pattern of claiming he created many of the standards that made Ethereum successful, including the \u2018fungible\u2019 tokens behind ICOs. The ERC-20 standard originally described the most commonly used API for Ethereum-based fungible tokens. The document doesn\u2019t list Nerayoff as a contributor unless he was going by a pseudonym.\n\nDid Vitalik invent anything? No he did not. Ethereum never scaled bc of him. Only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 14, 2023\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs question Ethereum\u2019s The DAO\n\nTruthLabs supposedly found evidence that the Ethereum Foundation and Slock.it were behind the infamous hack of The DAO that precipitated the hard fork between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nNothing would surprise me but seems more likely others will flip on them. Now let me see, was the DAO an inside job? Oh there are too many to even count. They have a whole industry of people who could turn on them. Frankly I refused to cooperate at all but that\u2019s me most would. \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nRead more: Ethereum centralization is becoming a serious problem\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the DAO hack was an inside job. Publicly, Slock.it was hit hard, and eventually sold to Blockchains.com in 2019. Blockchains.com rebranded Slock.it to BC Development Labs.\n\nSo, what did the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say about The DAO? According to Commissioners, The DAO insiders sold DAO tokens as unregistered securities. However, the SEC declined to file charges in that particular case.\n\nNerayoff and TruthLabs also call out ex-SEC Director Bill Hinman\n\nBy now, it is no secret that former SEC chief William Hinman likely had an Ethereum-related conflict of interest while working for the SEC. Protos has previously covered Hinman\u2019s financial conflict of interest and its potential impact on the SEC v. Ripple case.\n\nBill Hinman routinely met Simpson Thacher & Bartlett employees, which received funding from a pro-Ethereum entity, including an employee who worked for its Hong Kong division. Hinman also did not divest from his financial interest in the Simpson Thacher, which had done work for the Ethereum Foundation, despite being warned to by the SEC\u2019s ethics office.\n\nAfter the Empower emails, I said a \ud83d\ude4a could prove Hinman violated the criminal financial conflict laws. You can be found violating 18 USC 208 if you allow even only an appearance of impropriety w/o being told you\u2019re violating the law. Here, he was told multiple times but did it. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 13, 2023\n\nHowever, according to Nerayoff, the corruption among government officials might go far beyond just William Hinman\u2019s opining that ETH offers were not securities transactions.\n\nA transcript of a Mario Nawfal X audio space reveals that Nerayoff believes the SEC, DoJ, and FBI fabricated charges against him. \u201cThey were looking to get as many people in this industry as possible. And that all started at the very same time,\u201d he said. He also implied that Hinman was in on the Ethereum inside job.\n\nSome individuals were skeptical. However, attorney Michael Scotto opined that Nerayoff \u201chas a case.\u201d\n\nYes @StevenNerayoff has a case. IT EXISTS. We will be releasing all his filings in the near future. As his attorney I just wish he would stop talking until then, but he is very eager to share his experience. Although I won\u2019t go into details I will say everything he has said is\u2026 https://t.co/cKQuuzgxP9 \u2014 michael scotto (@mascotto89) October 28, 2023\n\nNerayoff acknowledged that his lawyers advised him not to post about it in a lengthy X post. However, he says he cares more about holding people accountable than the money he allegedly lost.\n\nMistakes in Gary Gensler\u2019s MIT course?\n\nPrior to becoming chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler taught a course about blockchain at MIT.\n\nTruthLabs has questioned why Gensler used this class to spread, in TruthLabs\u2019 opinion, false information about Ethereum\u2019s history. According to TruthLabs, his allegedly false teaching material included Gensler\u2019s claim that Canadian VCs mostly supported Ethereum during its pre-ICO days. Rather than Canadian money, as Protos has covered, Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money. If deflecting attention from China to Canada was intentional, TruthLabs posits that William Hinman might not be the only SEC official with an interest in misrepresenting Ethereum\u2019s financial ties.\n\nWhy is Gary Gensler teaching a false history on Ethereum's ICO in his MIT class?\n\n\n\nIn this \ud83e\uddf5, I will show you that it was the CCP that invested in Ethereum in its pre-ICO days, and not Canadian VC's like Gary teaches. pic.twitter.com/xfGtlux85C \u2014 TruthLabs \ud83e\udee1 (@BoringSleuth) April 19, 2023\n\nOther claims made in Gensler\u2019s lecture on Ethereum included the idea that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO. Lubin disagrees with this percentage, claiming he never owned more than half a percent of Ethereum\u2019s supply.\n\nNerayoff called Lubin out on this, citing a video in which Lubin said buying large quantities of tokens, or buying them to speculate, could become a sign that the token is a security.\n\nLubin is saying if you buy tokens in large quantities or to speculate it\u2019s a security. Gensler on video said Lubin was a VC who bought Ether in large quantities to speculate.\n\n\n\nSo, Ether is a security according to Lubin & Gensler due to Lubin\u2019s actions.\n\n\n\nWanna brag some more Joe?\u2026 https://t.co/BFLi3ZRmPv \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 12, 2023\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s why \u2018news\u2019 attacking Gary Gensler is all over crypto media\n\nRevisiting Ethereum\u2019s ties to China\n\nAnyway, TruthLabs claims that Chinese entities Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and Fenbushi Capital were involved in setting up some of Lubin\u2019s Ethereum wallets.\n\nProtos has previously covered Ethereum\u2019s extensive ties to Chinese money.\n\nTruthLabs also found evidence that Wanxiang Blockchain Labs set the Ethereum Foundation wallet up. Wanxiang\u2019s Dr. Xiao Feng went on record about its early support for Ethereum, pledging $500,000 to help launch it.\n\nGary Gensler teached to the public that Joseph Lubin bought 10% of the ICO for himself. Whats his source? Lubin claims he never even owned half a percent of Ethereums supply. So whats up with this 10%? And did he know about how Lubin called to disguise all major investors? pic.twitter.com/zpYgnOaWNP \u2014 Mr. Huber\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd25 (@Leerzeit) April 19, 2023\n\nTruthLabs also notes a coincidence that Wanxiang Group and MIT announced a \u2018partnership\u2019 in March 2018. TruthLabs notes that it is possible that Chinese government-connected individuals could have used proxy or puppet entities to exert influence over Ethereum.\n\nLaura Shin\u2019s book, The Cryptopians, detailed allegations that Vitalik Buterin tolerated an out-of-place Chinese national named Ming Chan, who served as the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s executive director, for a curious span of time \u2014 even after she clashed with other foundation members.\n\nInterestingly, Chan assumed that role in 2015 \u2014 the same year that Nerayoff alleges Buterin asked him about restructuring or saving the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nEthereum also famously published its whitepaper first in two languages: English initially, and then Chinese.\n\nFinally, and somewhat off-topic, Nerayoff makes yet another assertion: Vitalik Buterin could have shorted Ethereum at some point.\n\nAwaiting evidence from Steven Nerayoff, TruthLabs\n\nIn summary, Nerayoff and TruthLabs\u2019 allegations are seemingly impossible to ignore. However, it\u2019s important to remember that they are just that: allegations.\n\nNerayoff claims to be releasing another round of evidence today or tomorrow and intends to fight for his intellectual property rights in court.\n\nEthereum initially wanted to build a decentralized digital asset ecosystem. Much of its initial marketing billed it as a \u201cworld computer\u201d that could be used for blockchain applications like smart contracts. However, since inception, Ethereum has maintained strong ties to Chinese executives with curious motivations.\n\nBoth Nerayoff and TruthLabs claim to be interested in publicizing their version of the truth about Ethereum\u2019s origins and initial motivations. Many observers have been and will continue to await their allegedly irrefutable evidence.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

        "content": "BlackRock brings legitimacy to Ethereum with new ETF filing.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received a registration statement on Form S-1 from BlackRock for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will hold ETH, the native token of the Ethereum network.\n\nAccording to the Form S-1, the iShares Ethereum Trust is structured as a Delaware statutory trust. It will hold ETH as its primary asset and issue shares to investors that will be listed and traded on Nasdaq.\n\nThe stated objective of the Trust is to reflect the performance of the price of ether. The Trust will value its ether holdings based on the CF Benchmarks Ether-Dollar Reference Rate index.\n\nThe sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, an affiliate of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. BlackRock Fund Advisors will serve as the trustee, while Coinbase Custody, will act as the custodian for the Trust\u2019s ETH.\n\nCoinbase will also serve as the prime broker for the Trust. According to the filing, the prime broker will facilitate the sale of the Trust\u2019s ether as needed to pay expenses and fees.\n\nThe filing notes that the Trust may hold rights to acquire other digital assets through forks, airdrops, or similar events related to its ether holdings. However, the sponsor has discretion on whether to claim these assets.\n\nA substantial portion of the S-1 discusses various risks related to investing in the Trust and ether itself. These include volatility risk, security threats, regulatory uncertainty, and competition from other digital assets and blockchain platforms.\n\nThe SEC will now begin its review process to determine whether to approve the proposed ether ETF. The regulator has rejected several previous applications for spot bitcoin ETFs but has yet to rule on an ether ETF.\n\nThe official filing comes days after BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum Trust entity with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations. Hours after the filing, Nasdaq also submitted a 19b-4 filing with the SEC, confirming that BlackRock is working on launching a spot ether ETF.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s size and influence could help sway regulators towards finally approving a spot crypto ETF in the US. As the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over $10 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock brings institutional legitimacy to the volatile crypto space."

        "content": "Steven Nerayoff\u2019s impending disclosure concerning alleged fraudulent activities by Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin is drawing closer, with a scheduled reveal in just 48 hours.\n\nNerayoff, a figure with intimate knowledge of Ethereum\u2019s early days, has been vocal in recent weeks about the alleged misconduct of the platform\u2019s founders. This anticipated revelation, set for November 16, follows a series of accusations that Nerayoff claims overshadow even the notorious FTX scandal.\n\nEthereum Insider Starts 48-Hour Countdown\n\nSpeaking via X (formerly Twitter), Nerayoff revealed that the release of his proof of the fraud allegations against Ethereum\u2019s founders \u201cShould be within 48 hours hopefully less. Logistics, setting up smart NFTs, etc.\u201d\n\nHis recent communications have increasingly targeted Buterin, suggesting a deeper involvement in alleged fraudulent activities. He asserted, \u201cRemember this video when I drop the recording & what I tell Vitalik about 2.0 and to fix misaligned incentive structures. Is Vitalik the savior they bill him as to make Ethereum scale or is he the reason it never scaled? Decide for yourselves.\u201d\n\nNerayoff continued, questioning the originality of Buterin\u2019s contributions: \u201cDid Vitalik invent anything? No he did not. Ethereum never scaled because of him.\u201d Furthermore, he accuses Buterin and Lubin of deliberately focusing on proliferating what he alleges were fraudulent ICOs, thus hindering the entire crypto sector.\n\nHe claims, \u201c[The] only killer app was issuing Utility Tokens on ICOs both of which I invented. Vitalik & Lubin sabotaged crypto. Their focus was merely to issue hundreds or thousands of fraudulent ICOs fleecing people.\u201d Nerayoff further touts that Joe Lubin\u2019s ConsenSys\u2019s \u201conly revenue generating business\u201d in the early days was to \u201cissue ICOs mainly through Token Foundry.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum insider also challenged the efficacy of Buterin\u2019s white paper, crediting Gavin Wood for Ethereum\u2019s initial success: \u201cHis [Buterin\u2019s] white paper was unworkable. Gavin fixed it in his yellow paper & he\u2019s the reason 1.0 got out the door. Vitalik is the reason 2.0 never got out the door.\u201d\n\nIn a stark statement, Nerayoff positions himself as a whistleblower, intent on exposing a decade of corruption, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to be strategic & only focus on what I can prove not just allege. I am only doing it to reveal the truth but then others will have to untangle the rest of the 10 years of corruption. I know this much, the Free Pass is going to cost somebody something.\u201d\n\nWhy Do Buterin And Lubin Not Fight Back?\n\nHe also questioned the lack of legal action against him, suggesting that the absence of denials or lawsuits lends credibility to his allegations: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone suing me for these \u2018outrageous\u2019 allegations? They have armies of lawyers & billions of dollars. Nobody will even deny they did unethical things they ignore it. If I was clean I\u2019d simply say no.\u201d\n\nNotably, Nerayoff also revealed today that many parties involved have contacted him since he spoke publicly on the Ethereum fraud, underscoring the seriousness of his allegations:\n\n\u201cI made sure this story would go public & not dependent on me by giving info for major press before I came forward. Notice not a single denial or even answers to basic questions of impropriety from anyone. Makes one question how deep & wide this goes.\u201d\n\nAt press time, the Ethereum price stood at $2,030 after being rejected at the yearly high.\n\nFeatured image from Bloomberg.com, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Chainwire Nocturne Launches on Mainnet to Bring Private Accounts to Ethereum Chainwire \u00b7 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release. Readers should conduct their own research prior to taking any actions related to the content mentioned in this article. Learn more \u203a\n\nNEW YORK, United States, November 15th, 2023, Chainwire \u2013 Nocturne, a protocol enabling on-chain private accounts, today announced the successful deployment of Nocturne v1 to Ethereum mainnet. This marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more private and accessible Ethereum. For the first time, users will have a compatible and easy-to-use product resembling a private onchain account.\n\nNocturne v1 is a step towards compatible onchain privacy that functions simply as another account rather than a distinct tool or ecosystem. Users will find transacting with Nocturne similar to using a smart contract wallet, with the added benefit of privacy. Nocturne v1 is currently out-of-the-box compatible with any DeFi protocol that represents state via output tokens (e.g. Uniswap swap tokens, Aave aTokens, Compound cTokens, etc). There are plans to later extend this compatibility to arbitrary protocols.\n\n\u201cWith Nocturne v1\u2019s launch, we\u2019re moving away from the notion of a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019 Privacy should be embedded at the account layer and the v1 launch is the first step in making this possible,\u201d said Luke Tchang, CEO and co-founder of Nocturne. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that everyone, from individual users to large institutions, can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world. This is more than a product; it\u2019s a commitment to making Etherereum more accessible and enabling secure and private money over the internet.\u201d\n\nNocturne is built on the belief that privacy on public blockchains will only become mainstream if it\u2019s seamlessly integrated with the existing user experience. Nocturne\u2019s objective is straightforward: to create private user accounts on L1/L2 that are fully compatible with existing Ethereum accounts. To read more about private accounts, please see Nocturne\u2019s recent blog post.\n\nPrivacy: The Keystone for Ethereum\u2019s Growth\n\nThough DeFi and other onchain activities have surged in popularity, privacy concerns have prevented broader acceptance and use of crypto as money. Recognizing that the typical user may be uneasy with the idea of their financial dealings being public, and that institutions demand confidentiality for their transactions, Nocturne addresses these critical barriers head-on. Privacy isn\u2019t just a feature\u2014it\u2019s foundational to the broader adoption of crypto.\n\nNocturne\u2019s Future Vision\n\nAs they continue building new versions, Nocturne\u2019s long-term vision is to make the experience so seamless that by default, every Ethereum user automatically has a private account which mirrors their public account. In short, a seamless parallel account layer for privacy.\n\nNocturne\u2019s plans for achieving its longer-term vision include:\n\nTransition to a more permissionless protocol by migrating to proof of innocence, as described by Vitalik and Ameen Solemani in the Practical Privacy & Compliance paper.\n\nBring Nocturne accounts closer to usable as general wallets by extending Nocturne\u2019s protocol compatibility to arbitrary smart contracts.\n\nImprove the compatibility of Nocturne accounts with EOAs and smart accounts through a scheme that allows for public wallet authorization to be leveraged within Nocturne for security.\n\nHow To Access\n\nNocturne v1 is live and can be accessed through a dedicated private vault UI, allowing users to discreetly manage their assets. The current UI capabilities include deposits, transfers to new burner addresses, and private swaps and staking. To get started, visit app.nocturne.xyz.\n\nAbout Nocturne Labs\n\nNocturne Labs is a forward-thinking blockchain technology company committed to addressing the most critical privacy and user experience challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem. With a pioneering protocol for private accounts, Nocturne enables users to transact safely with built-in privacy. This marks a substantial stride in advancing the usability of public blockchains. Backed by notable investors such as Bain Capital Crypto, Polychain Capital, Bankless, and Vitalik, Nocturne is led by a team of experienced developers dedicated to enabling a more secure and accessible Ethereum.

        "title": "What is Plasma and why is Vitalik Buterin into it all over again? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants to bring back Plasma as a blockchain scaling solution that could sidestep existing data availability concerns.\n\nFirst created in 2017, Plasma networks can be considered \u201cchild\u201d chains of the Ethereum mainnet. These execute transactions away from Ethereum using their own block-validation mechanisms, then periodically post final states back to mainnet.\n\nPlasma chains differ from popular scaling solutions such as Arbitrum or Optimism, which instead post computed data back to Ethereum mainnet, although it is compressed.\n\nIn the blockchain world, data tied to computational tasks \u2014 such as processing transactions \u2014 must be stored somewhere. When stored on-chain this process is often costly and time-consuming for network participants, particularly validators and other node operators.\n\nFull nodes on Ethereum mainnet \u2014 and there are roughly 11,000 of them active worldwide \u2014 download all the data of each block so that network participants can verify it. This redundancy make it difficult for invalid transactions to be mistakenly executed.\n\nAlthough great for security, the consensus process hinders scalability as it is inefficient and reduces throughput.\n\nWith Plasma, all data processing and computational tasks are kept off Ethereum mainnet \u2014 only final verified states are posted to the chain \u2014 and thus less data takes up Ethereum block space.\n\nThe problem with Plasma\n\nAccording to Buterin, Plasma was not considered by the current batch of roll-up solutions for its overwhelming costs around client-side data storage and its application limits. This made it difficult to build Plasma-powered apps which did more than simple payments.\n\nIn his recent blog post, Buterin discussed a previous Plasma implementation known as Plasma Cash. This system sees each individual coin as its own non-fungible token (NFT) with a unique history.\n\nOperators on Plasma chains create new blocks in the form of a root of a Merkle tree. This means that every time there is a transaction, the owner of that transaction can be found by stepping through the tree.\n\nIf an operator chooses to misbehave by publishing an invalid or unavailable block, the owner of that transaction will have seven days to cancel by showing that they are either not the latest owner, that there is a double spend, or that there is an invalid history. This can make for a clunky process in the real-world, Buterin explained.\n\n\u201cIf you receive 0.001 ETH each from hundreds of people who are buying coffees from you, you are going to have 0.001 ETH in many places in the tree, and so actually exiting that ETH would still require submitting many separate exits, making the gas fees prohibitive,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nDefragmentation protocols do exist, Buterin said, but they are difficult to implement in practice. Further, it is difficult to apply the Plasma design to a generalized Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) as the design requires specific owners to object to false transactions.\n\nMany DeFi protocols on-chain, for example, do not have unique or individual owners, meaning that complex applications would not be able to work on Plasma.\n\nEnter zk-SNARKS\n\nButerin noted that concerns around Plasma can be resolved with the introduction of zk-SNARKS and validity proofs.\n\nZk-SNARKS, short for \u201czero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,\u201d enables blockchains to prove that information is accurate without revealing the contents of the information itself.\n\nSNARKS are the proof system, and validity proofs are cryptographic proofs which attest that the information is indeed accurate.\n\n\u201cThe largest challenge of making Plasma work for payments, client-side data storage, can be efficiently addressed with validity proofs. Additionally, validity proofs provide a wide array of tools that allow us to make a Plasma-like chain that runs an EVM,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nValidity proofs will be able to prove that each Plasma block that is on the blockchain is valid \u2014 meaning that it will no longer be necessary to worry about who the last owner of each individual transaction on a Merkle tree is.\n\n\u201cIn a validity-proven Plasma chain, such withdrawals would not be subject to any challenges at all. This means that, in the normal case, withdrawals can be instant,\u201d Buterin wrote.\n\nConsiderations\n\nAlthough zk-SNARKs and validity proofs can address significant problems with the previous Plasma design, Buterin reasoned, there are still limitations.\n\nThis is most clearly highlighted when a particular state object, such as a token, does not have a clear economic owner.\n\nButerin drew on the example of Uniswap liquidity provider positions: \u201cIf you traded USDC for ETH in a Uniswap position, you could try to withdraw your pre-trade USDC and your post-trade ETH. If you collude with the Plasma chain operator, the liquidity providers and other users would not have access to the post-trade state, so they would not be able to withdraw their post-trade USDC.\u201d\n\nThis shows that although Plasma potentially offers useful solutions, there may still be concerns about bad actors, which should be addressed.\n\nDespite this, Buterin believes that Plasma remains an underrated design in the blockchain technology space and could help ease Ethereum transaction fees.\n\n\u201cRollups remain the gold standard, and have security properties that cannot be matched. This is particularly true from the developer experience perspective: nothing can match the simplicity of an application developer not even having to think about ownership graphs and incentive flows within their application,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cHowever, Plasma lets us completely sidestep the data availability question, greatly reducing transaction fees. Plasma can be a significant security upgrade for chains that would otherwise be validiums.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "The price of the Solana token jumped Wednesday amid an ongoing rally in altcoins and bullish remarks on the token from famed tech investor Cathie Wood.\n\nSolana was last higher by nearly 18% at $65.65. It has nearly tripled in price in the past month.\n\nThe spike comes a day after Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood applauded its performance this year on CNBC.\n\n\"Solana is doing a really good job,\" she told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"Ether was faster and cheaper than bitcoin [back] in the day \u2013 that's how we got ether. Solana is even faster and [more] cost-effective than ether.\"\n\nWood went on to say on CNBC Pro Talks that she \"really does like Solana\" while also noting that its downtime \u2013 the time the network is down, under maintenance, or suffering an outage \u2013 \"is much higher than it is for Ethereum.\"\n\n\"People are willing to put up with that because maybe the transaction sizes are not as large or for some reason are not as important, they just want speed and cost as their top priority,\" Wood told CNBC PRO. \"Each one of [the networks] is going to have a place.\"\n\nSolana, the sixth largest crypto token by market cap, according to CoinGecko, became the darling of the crypto world in the 2021 bull market as it sold investors a vision of something like Ethereum, but without the slow and expensive transactions.\n\nActivity on Solana has been growing all year, particularly in liquid staking protocols like Jito, according to data provider Kaiko. The token has topped the list of the most traded altcoins on US-available exchanges this year, outpacing dogecoin , litecoin , Polygon's MATIC and Ripple's XRP .\n\nMore recently, the token is following a broader crypto market rally led by bitcoin, that began Oct. 24, when the coin doubled for the year and topped $35,000 for first time since May 2022. Shortly, after ether followed, rising to the key psychological level of $2,000. Historically, the altcoin rally tends to follow ether.\n\n\"After Oct. 24 bitcoin started losing its momentum, which during bitcoin bull markets causes traders to go down the risk curve and switch to alts as a way of chasing huge profits,\" said Miko\u0142aj Zakrzowski, an analyst at data provider CryptoQuant.\n\nThis time a year ago, the coin was facing a crucible moment after the FTX blowup sent it down 70% over two days and briefly traded under $10. FTX and its now-fallen leader Sam Bankman-Fried were widely credited with providing substantial money and resources behind the Solana project to get it off the ground.\n\nSolana is up about 550% this year and has been one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2023. By comparison, bitcoin and ether have gained about 127% and 70%, respectively."

Residents of the United States and the United Kingdom will not be able to claim PYTH tokens; nor will residents of North Korea, Ukraine, Cuba, Syria, Iran, Yemen, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and eight other nations and territories.\n\nPyth\u2019s native token will have an initial circulating supply of 1.5 billion, according to the network. 8.5 billion additional PYTH tokens will unlock between six and 42 months from launch.\n\nDeFi oracle networks like Pyth connect blockchains with data sources from the off-chain world, allowing DeFi smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs from real-world events and data. They can enable smart contracts, for example, to automatically order products when an inventory drops; to pay out agreements that hinge on the price of stocks and commodities; or to track carbon emissions and tax a company if a certain level is exceeded. Oracle networks are central to the growing integration of the crypto market and traditional financial markets, as well as the application of smart contracts to traditional businesses.\n\nAs intermediaries of information, oracle networks can also be exploited. Last fall, a hacker managed to drain $100 million from decentralized exchange Mango Markets by manipulating the oracle-reported price of the MNGO token.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPyth is the fourth-largest such oracle network by total value secured, according to DeFi Llama; Pyth\u2019s chief competitor, Chainlink, boasts over nine times the value secured, and a dominant 45% market share, compared with Pyth\u2019s 4.83%.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "BlackRock submitted an application for an Ethereum ETF to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe objective of the iShares Ethereum Trust is to replicate the price performance of Ethereum.\n\nThis new development could also increase the chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nBlackRock, the investment management giant, has taken a significant step forward in regard to crypto ETFs. On November 15, 2023, the company formally submitted its S-1 application for a spot Ethereum ETF, marking a pivotal moment in the listing process.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nImpact on Ethereum Price\n\nDespite the anticipation surrounding this move, the effect on Ethereum\u2019s price has been relatively subdued. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum is trading at $2040, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $248 billion. The 7-day chart for ETH indicates a noteworthy uptrend of over 8 percent.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Ethereum Strategy\n\nBlackRock\u2019s strategic move into the Ethereum space was unveiled recently when it filed for a spot ETH ETF named \u2018iShares Ethereum Trust\u2019 with the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations. Nasdaq further fueled this development by filing a proposal for the listing and trading of shares associated with the spot Ethereum ETF. This announcement caused a surge in Ethereum\u2019s value, breaching the $2100 level.\n\nThe SEC filing discloses that Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian for the spot ETH ETF. Additionally, the shares, set to be listed on the Nasdaq, will follow the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Influence in the Market\n\nBlackRock\u2019s influence in the ETF market is not a recent development. The investment management giant played a pioneering role by filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. This move triggered a domino effect, inspiring several other significant players in the ETF market to follow suit.\n\nFurthermore, BlackRock\u2019s involvement has heightened the prospects of a spot Bitcoin ETF receiving approval. The progress and developments in BlackRock\u2019s filings have correlated with notable fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

Submitted to the Delaware Department of State Division of Corporations, this fake filing prompted a swift rise in XRP\u2019s value, leading to the liquidation of over $7 million worth of futures positions.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Officially Files for a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nSEC\u2019s Role\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s plans for altcoins remain uncertain, its influence on the crypto market is undeniable. The trajectory of these developments now rests in the hands of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDuring Gary Gensler\u2019s tenure as SEC chairman, Ethereum\u2019s classification as a security or commodity remained unresolved. Gensler, in his previous role at MIT in 2018, indicated that the SEC did not label Ethereum a security due to its perceived decentralization. This viewpoint echoes sentiments expressed by former SEC Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, in June 2018.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s effort towards crypto ETFs is helping the crypto market move in the right direction. However, the SEC is still quite active and there will be challenges before these ETFs become a reality.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "title": "Is ETH About to Crash Below $2K? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Technical Analysis\n\nBy GreatestTrader\n\nBuyers in the Ethereum market have recently driven the price into a strong uptrend, reaching a critical resistance level at $2K. However, encountering a significant hurdle around this crucial mark, there exists the potential for a temporary consolidation correction phase in the coming days.\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of the daily chart reveals substantial support around the crucial region, comprising the static support at $1,500 and the lower boundary of the wedge pattern. This support fueled a significant surge, indicating strong buying momentum, with buyers targeting the critical $2K resistance zone.\n\nDespite reaching this key level, aligned with the wedge\u2019s upper boundary, Ethereum faced rejection, leading to a slight retracement towards the broken 200-day moving average at $1,783.\n\nConsidering the significance of the resistance at $2K and the associated wedge pattern\u2019s upper boundary, a temporary continuation of the ongoing retracement followed by consolidation around the broken moving averages is highly likely. If the price completes a pullback to the broken moving averages, buyers may re-enter the market, aiming once again for the substantial $2K level.\n\n\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the intensified buying pressure around the $1,5K support region propelled Ethereum toward the substantial $2K resistance. This upward movement demonstrated significant bullish momentum, reflecting the buyers\u2019 dominance in the market.\n\nHowever, the $2K region represents a crucial psychological resistance, posing challenges for buyers to push the price higher. Notably, a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggested insufficient buying pressure, leading to a reversal and slight corrections.\n\nAdditionally, a recognizable double-top pattern around this pivotal resistance confirmed the presence of sellers in the short term.\n\nGiven the existing market dynamics, there is a high likelihood of an extended consolidation correction phase in the short term. This implies that the market might continue its retracement before definitively determining its next course of action. In this scenario, the support range between the 0.5 and 61.8 levels of the Fibonacci retracement ($1,839 \u2013 $1,769) is expected to be the next level of interest for Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\n\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy GreatestTrader\n\nThe futures market has been a significant influencer of Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics, making it imperative for the current uptrend to sustain favorable conditions in this market.\n\nIllustrated in the chart is the 30-day moving average of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell ratio, a crucial metric for gauging sentiment in the futures market. During a period of substantial price increase in Ethereum, the taker buy-sell ratio exhibited a robust uptrend, signaling strong buying interest. However, a recent reversal in the metric\u2019s trend has led to a downtrend, dipping below the threshold of 1. This reversal indicates that sellers are now executing more aggressive orders in the aggregate, potentially to realize profits or to take short positions.\n\nSignificantly, this shift in the metric aligns with the recent market rejection and its struggle to move higher. The confluence of these events suggests a potential for a short-term retracement in Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nShould the taker buy-sell ratio resume an upward trajectory, surpassing the 1 threshold, it would indicate a revival of bullish sentiment in the short term, potentially supporting the continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a failure of the metric to exhibit upward movement would raise concerns about the sustainability of any bullish momentum."

This is why I just said @Cardano_CF is my top pick in crypto. You will hear on the recording me telling @VitalikButerin he made a major mistake in getting rid of @IOHK_Charles & should bring him back. Are the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles\u2026 https://t.co/x5w6yDRB4M \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 15, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA Huge Mistake Getting Rid of Hoskinson\n\nIt bears mentioning that Cardano was established in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, one of the founders of the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 following a dispute with Buterin over whether the network should be a non-profit or commercial project. While Hoskinson wanted Ethereum to be designed for commercial purposes, Buterin supported the non-profit initiative.\n\nOver seven years after Hoskinson left Ethereum, Nerayoff revealed that he informed Buterin that he made a huge mistake getting rid of the Cardano boss.\n\n\u201cAre the clueless smug @ethereum cultists who got rid of Charles happy now that the boy genius is copying Cardano?\u201d he quizzed.\n\nButerin Copied Ripple Smart Contract Functionality\n\nAdditionally, Nerayoff alleged that Buterin copied innovative ideas from Ripple to develop Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFurthermore, Nerayoff claimed that Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin also stole his idea on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and utility tokens.\n\nPer Nerayoff, Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality and ICO were the only two things that have been successful for the crypto project. Notably, Nerayoff\u2019s allegations have continued to raise questions about Ethereum\u2019s technological underpinnings.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s latest allegation comes a few hours after he promised to provide proof concerning Lubin and Buterin\u2019s alleged fraudulent activities. In a November 12 tweet, the crypto advisor promised to share this proof within the next 4 \u2013 5 days.\n\nPast Allegations Against Ethereum Team\n\nRecently, Nerayoff has been making shocking allegations against the Ethereum team, especially Lubin and Buterin. As reported earlier, he claimed that both Ethereum execs had secret dealings with SEC chair Gary Gensler and the agency\u2019s immediate past chairman Jay Clayton.\n\nIn addition, Neayoff alleged that the fraud carried out by Ethereum\u2019s founders is 1,000 times bigger than the ones perpetrated by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).\n\nHe recently accused the duo of sabotaging crypto and conducting fraudulent ICOs. To date, neither Buterin nor Lubin have responded to any of these allegations."

Ethereum (ETH) is following the trend set by the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, the same cannot be said for Ripple (XRP), at least not yet, as the remittance token's price is showing weakness.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price drops, $90 million in open interest wiped out amid jitter over spot BTC ETF window closing\n\nBitcoin price pulls north as momentum restores\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pulling north, trying to recover all the ground lost in the recent crash that saw up to $90 million in open interest wiped out of the market. With the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) coming into play at $34,572, BTC is trying to reclaim territory above the critical resistance at $36,788.\n\nFor a confirmed move north, investors should watch for Bitcoin price to break and close above the $36,788 level. This will set the tone for BTC to target the $37,972 range high before reaching the $38,000 psychological level.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend its reach to tag the $40,000 psychological level, with such a move constituting a 10% climb above current levels.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is tipping north, suggesting momentum is rising, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) holds in positive territory. This adds credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, another rejection from the $36,788 resistance level could see Bitcoin price losing support due to the 25-day and 50-day EMAs at $34,572 and $32,456, respectively, before dipping into the supply zone turned bullish breaker where it could test the 100-day EMA at $30,528.\n\nAlso Read: Over $1 billion worth of BTC susceptible to be sold as Bitcoin price hints at short-term correction\n\nEthereum price holds above $1,935\n\nEthereum (ETH) price maintains above the $1,935 level, a crucial support that could spell doom for ETH if lost. With the RSI tipping north and the AO holding in the positive zone, ETH could scale north, restoring itself above the $2,029 support in order to ride the ascending trendline. This could ship the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to the $2,136 range high.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if selling pressure increases, Ethereum price could slip below the $1,935 support. A decisive move below this level would confirm the downtrend, with ETH likely to test the 25-day or 50-day EMA at $1,892 and $1,806, respectively.\n\nIn a worse case, Ethereum price could tag the 100-day EMA at $1,763, with a break and close below it invalidating the bullish thesis under the $1,753 support level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: Eighteen-months ascending triangle pattern appraises $4,000 target for ETH\n\nRipple price breaks the triangle\n\nRipple (XRP) price has shown weakness, breaking out of the triangle to the downside amid reducing volatility. Increased selling pressure could send XRP below the 25-day EMA at $0.6181. A break and close below the $0.5981 would lower optimism for a move north.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if buyer momentum increases, Ripple price could restore back above the lower trendline of the triangle above $0.6584, which would set the tone for a move to $0.7000.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend toward the Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $0.7519 to $0.7623, with Ripple price filling the inefficiency and restoring balance.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could extend gains with Ripple\u2019s likely win through $20 million settlement with SEC"

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday announced that it will \u201cdesignate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change\u201d for Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Futures Trust.\n\nThe filing pushes the deadline to Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nIn the filing, the SEC said that the \u201cCommission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\u201d Essentially, the regulatory agency has another window to push back a decision.\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart posted on X that the delay of the 19b-4 filing was not \u201cremotely surprising.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nGrayscale filed in early October to convert its Ethereum Trust into an ETF.\n\n\u201cAs we file to convert ETHE to an ETF, the natural next step in the product\u2019s evolution, we recognize this as an important moment to bring Ethereum even further into the US regulatory perimeter,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn August, Grayscale scored a court win against the SEC after it sought to convert its bitcoin trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nThe judges didn\u2019t order the SEC to give Grayscale\u2019s proposal a greenlight, but rather ordered the regulatory body to re-examine the application it originally denied.\n\nThe panel of judges agreed that the original denial, but the allowance of bitcoin futures ETFs was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAlongside spot bitcoin ETFs, firms are now vying to get spot ether ETFs off the ground. Ark Invest and 21Shares plan to introduce five funds holding both bitcoin futures and ether futures this week. Both filed for the products back in August.\n\nIn early October, six ETFs holding ether futures launched, with roughly $20 million or so in combined assets under management as of early November.\n\nAdditionally, ETF watchers are keeping a close eye on the SEC\u2019s approach to the spot bitcoin ETFs after big traditional finance firms such as BlackRock threw their hats in the ring.\n\nThe SEC also postponed decisions on the big ETFs in late September ahead of a potential government shutdown.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether dominate the cryptocurrency landscape accounting for approximately 65% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. Until now, participating in the cryptocurrency market required taking a directional view on either bitcoin, ether, or both. EBR futures allow institutional investors to position themselves to address broader market dynamic questions through the anticipated strength of one currency over the other.\n\nThe new futures contracts allow institutional investors a divergence play to react to questions such as: \u201cwhat will have greater market impact; staking of ETH vs the halving of BTC?\u201d or \u201cWhat will accelerate faster; tokenization using ETH vs adoption of BTC as a store of value?\u201d\n\nSophisticated traders may now execute an operationally easy, relative value trade between Ether futures (ETH) and Bitcoin futures (BTC) in one transaction, bypassing the need for individual leg execution.\n\nHistorically, bitcoin and ether have been highly correlated. Over time, as the two assets have grown in their own capacities, market dynamics may affect the performance of one cryptocurrency more than the other.\n\nBitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market and could see some strong inflows as the macro-economic environment shifts. Large investors may continue to prefer BTC exposure for its liquidity, market cap, and relative stability. Simultaneously, ether has practical applications as the currency of the Ethereum smart contract network. Some see ether being more than a store of value and think there could be further ether outperformance on the Ether futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) narrative. Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures enable professional participants to efficiently position themselves to benefit from the relative impact of these developments on the price relationship between ether and bitcoin.\n\nExecuting a notionally equivalent bitcoin ether spread trade manually may lead to price slippage and lost opportunity. The EBR futures seamlessly allow market participants the ability to rebalance positions between two different portfolios to benefit from better pricing and better liquidity. The innovative product also completes the cryptocurrency triangle allowing the ability to arbitrage synthetically, for the first time, all three futures legs: the BTC/USD, ETH/USD legs, and the ETH/BTC cross. EBR futures may also allow investors more flexibility when hedging positions in non-dollar offshore markets."

        "content": "Innovation is a funny thing. It often arrives with an excess of hype and then fades into disappointment\u2014before reemerging in full bloom. A case in point is JPMorgan Chase\u2019s \u201cJPM Coin,\u201d a corporate stablecoin launched shortly after the 2017 crypto bubble that seemed doomed to languish as a proof of concept that would never catch on in the real world.\n\nIn recent weeks however, the story around JPM Coin has changed dramatically as the bank announced that it is notching daily transaction volumes above $1 billion and that its big corporate clients are finally tapping into the coin\u2019s promise to provide \u201cprogrammable\u201d money.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with JPM Coin, it\u2019s a digital dollar that the bank created on a private version of the Ethereum blockchain. This means that clients with access to the coin (or ones like it) can enjoy the benefits of crypto technology\u2014including 24/7 transactions and smart contracts\u2014within a secure corporate environment. Well, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work in theory.\n\nIn reality, the past six years have been marked by a series of announcements involving banks and companies saying they\u2019ve carried out a blockchain transaction\u2014involving dollars or equities or commodities\u2014and that\u2019s been the end of the matter. While the transactions did occur, they didn\u2019t really matter since they were mostly one-off events that didn\u2019t lead to any changes in day-to-day commerce.\n\nThis has quietly begun to change, however, as companies have moved past the PR phase of blockchain and started tapping into its actual benefits. I spoke with Naveen Mallela, the head of coin systems (yes, that\u2019s a title) at JPMorgan Chases\u2019s Onyx unit, and he explained that the likes of Siemens, Cargill, and FedEx are all using these tools in daily operations.\n\nMallela told me that customers are viewing JPM Coin less as a stablecoin than as a tool to manage commercial deposits and take advantage of programmable money. I pushed him on that, asking what exactly he means by programmable. He explained that it means creating automated instructions for funds you control. A primitive illustration is autopay for bills but, thanks to blockchain, companies can now carry out far more sophisticated operations.\n\nMallela gave three persuasive examples of programmable money in action: companies using blockchain to carry out cash sweeps that used to happen once a day, but that can now occur anytime; finance firms using smart contracts to monitor and address margin calls for securities; and companies arranging for shipping payments to be released at various stages of a voyage.\n\nBy relying on smart contracts to handle these operations, companies can deploy cash and staffing resources more efficiently. And this is likely only the beginning. Mallela notes that IFTTT (\u201cif this, then that\u201d) instructions are becoming commonplace in the corporate blockchain environment and that companies will find more and more ways to use them.\n\nMeanwhile, programmable money is sprouting up in the investment sector as well\u2014JPMorgan Chase and Apollo just launched tokenized funds in Singapore, while a startup called Superstate, founded by the creator of the popular DeFi protocol Compound, just raised $14 million to do the same in the U.S. All of this shows that while blockchain-based finance is still far from mainstream, it has quietly taken a giant leap forward.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBinance is launching a new crypto exchange in Thailand alongside Gulf Energy, a giant conglomerate run by the country's second-richest man.

        "content": "The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued updated regulations regarding the listing and delisting of virtual currency on Nov. 15.\n\nThe department said that the new guidance builds on rules that it issued on Sept. 18. It said that it received input from various entities in a later comment period and is now setting out \u201cnew heightened standards.\u201d In addition to identifying various concerns, it said that the updated guidance contains clearer definitions of certain terms.\n\nIn practical terms, the guidance states that companies that previously had an approved cryptocurrency listing policy cannot self-certify any listings until they have both listing and delisting policies approved by the regulator under the new guidance.\n\nThe guidance also states that companies with an approved listing policy must notify NYDFS in writing of any self-certified listings and maintain records.\n\nThe guidance allows companies that do not have an approved listing policy to list cryptocurrencies that are included on the NYDFS greenlist. That greenlist includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and six stablecoins, including PayPal USD (PYUSD).\n\nFinally, companies must be able to safely end support for any coin when an elevated risk is identified. Therefore, all affected companies must have a coin delisting policy even if they do not have a listing policy. Companies creating delisting policies must meet a draft deadline on Dec. 8, 2023, and a final deadline on Jan. 31, 2024.\n\nRules apply to companies regulated in NY\n\nThe regulations apply to the 33 entities that are currently regulated under New York\u2019s BitLicense or its Limited Purpose Trust Charter.\n\nThis includes virtually all cryptocurrency firms that are engaged in activities in the state of New York. The list of regulated firms includes major companies such as Bakkt, BitGo, Coinbase, Gemini, Genesis, Fidelity, PayPal, Paxos, and several others.\n\nKnown for its rigorous cryptocurrency regulations, New York\u2019s current guidance does not seem to restrict the operations of the discussed companies, but it does underline the state\u2019s strict approach to compliance.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Plasma aimed to increase efficiency by taking the bulk of the data off the main chain.\n\nVitalik Buterin claimed that validity proofs could help in plugging the limitations of Plasma.\n\nAs Ethereum [ETH] congestion reached record levels, the need for effective scaling solutions was higher than ever in the blockchain industry.\n\nVitalik bats for Plasma chains\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin talked about the largely ignored advantages of layer-2 scaling solution Plasma in a recently published blog post, and urged Web3 developers to re-explore the technology.\n\nProposed by Buterin himself in 2017, Plasma aimed to increase efficiency by taking the bulk of the data off the main chain. The data is then redistributed onto a series of smaller chains called sidechains.\n\nDue to this, it was the best choice for high-throughput payment transactions.\n\nThese were the shortcomings\n\nHowever, the solution fell behind the competition due to its limitations in enabling smart contract deployment, something that rollups like Optimism [OP] and Arbitrum [ARB] allow.\n\nMoreover, Plasma sacrifices some aspects of security in favor of greater scalability. Highlighted by Vitalik Buterin as well, each Plasma sidechain was independent and responsible for its own security. This made them vulnerable to hacks if there wasn\u2019t enough mining power to secure them.\n\nOn the other hand, rollups, as we know, post all the information about executed transactions on the main chain. Therefore, rollups have been known to have much higher security than Plasma chains.\n\nWhat is the future?\n\nHowever, validity proofs could help in plugging the limitations of Plasma, said the inventor of Ethereum.\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cPlasma can be a significant security upgrade for chains that would otherwise be validiums. The fact that ZK-EVMs are finally coming to fruition this year makes it an excellent opportunity to re-explore this design space.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nRecall that Polygon [MATIC] introduced a proposal earlier to upgrade the PoS network to a zkEVM validium\n\nWhile admitting that rollups were the \u201cgold standard\u201d in scaling solutions, Buterin called for a revisit of Plasma technology because of its advantages in throughput and cost-effectiveness."

        "content": "A new meme coin prepares to join the race, but can it hang with the big boys?\n\nGameStop Memes: A Challenger for Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital currency, where Bitcoin and Ethereum have reigned supreme for years, a new player has emerged on the scene - GameStop Memes Coin. The rise of GameStop Memes Coin has caught the attention of the crypto world, and it's making waves with its unique approach and, most notably, its association with the popular meme culture. In this article, we delve deep into the world of GameStop Memes Coin, its origins, potential, and whether it can truly challenge the giants - Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe Genesis of GameStop Memes Coin\n\nGameStop Memes Coin, often referred to as \"GMS\" in the crypto community, has a fascinating story. It all started as a meme, much like the popular Dogecoin, which was created based on the Shiba Inu meme. The internet, known for its quirky sense of humor, loves to adopt these digital currencies, turning them into a form of satire. GameStop Memes Coin, with its roots in the GameStop stock market frenzy and meme culture, quickly garnered a cult following.\n\nA New Breed of Cryptocurrency\n\nGameStop Memes Coin is not your typical cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which rely on blockchain technology for security and transactions, GMC takes a different approach. It operates on a blockchain, but its primary function is to serve as a satirical token, poking fun at the serious nature of traditional cryptocurrencies.\n\nGameStop Memes Coin vs. Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\nOne of the key metrics to consider when comparing these cryptocurrencies is market capitalization. As of the latest data available, Bitcoin stands as the kingpin with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. Ethereum is no slouch either, with a market cap of over $300 billion. GameStop Memes Coin, on the other hand, lags significantly behind, with a relatively modest market cap.\n\nPopularity and Community\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as cryptocurrencies with strong and dedicated communities. They are recognized worldwide, with countless businesses and individuals accepting them as a means of payment. GameStop Memes Coin, while gaining popularity within meme culture, is yet to make a significant impact in mainstream transactions.\n\nUtility and Functionality\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum serve as decentralized digital currencies that enable secure peer-to-peer transactions and, in the case of Ethereum, smart contracts. Their utility in the real world is undeniable. GameStop Memes Coin, however, does not aim to be a serious player in the crypto world. Its primary purpose is satire, making it less practical for mainstream use.\n\nThe Power of Memes\n\nGameStop Memes Coin's strength lies in its association with internet memes. Memes have a unique way of spreading like wildfire across social media and online platforms. The power of memes can drive interest and curiosity in GameStop Memes Coin, even among those who are not actively involved in the crypto market.\n\nThe Uncertain Future\n\nWhile GameStop Memes Coin offers a breath of fresh air and humor in the world of cryptocurrencies, its long-term viability remains uncertain. The crypto market is highly volatile, and trends can change rapidly. Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as reliable and secure assets over the years, which provides them with a level of stability that GameStop Memes Coin may struggle to match.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn conclusion, GameStop Memes Coin has certainly made a splash in the crypto world, thanks to its association with internet memes and the GameStop stock market saga. However, it's important to remember that GameStop Memes Coin is more of a meme in itself, created for humor and satire rather than serious financial transactions. While it's entertaining and intriguing, it is unlikely to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the foreseeable future.\n\nFind Out More about GameStop Memes:\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Despite its dominant market share in the crypto sphere, Bitcoin has had limited applications compared to other blockchains which have blossomed to facilitate asset transfers in everything from financial products to video games.\n\nEthereum, for example, has close to 6,000 developers actively building on its network every month as of October 1, according to numbers from Developer Report. Bitcoin, in comparison, has just under 1,000 monthly developers.\n\nA California-based startup called ZetaChain wants to change that by including Bitcoin in the flourishing economy of decentralized finance (DeFi). Off the back of its sizable $27 million Series A raise in August, the company has been busy striking partnerships to scale its blockchain ecosystem.\n\nZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain upon which developers can build decentralized apps (dApps) and get access to other blockchains without the need for so-called \u201cbridges\u201d or \u201cwrapped coins\u201d, which are popular solutions that solve one of the biggest hurdles in crypto today \u2014 interoperability across different networks.\n\nOne of the breakthroughs brought by ZetaChain, according to its core contributor Ankur Nandwani, is that developers can deploy smart contracts on the blockchain that can interact with native Bitcoin, essentially adding a smart contract layer to Bitcoin. First proposed by Ethereum, smart contracts are lines of code that execute on predefined rules and have given rise to a proliferation of applications like non-fungible tokens.\n\n\u201cEvery blockchain is like an isolated state and we are connecting them,\u201d said Nandwani in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cMost people use Bitcoin as gold. If you can borrow against gold, you should be able to do what you do with gold for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nToday, ZetaChain announced that it\u2019s adding native Bitcoin support to decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi, letting users swap Bitcoin across 30 networks. Behind the scenes, Sushi works by deploying its EVM (Ethereum virtual machine)-compatible smart contract on ZetaChain, meaning that, for the first time, Sushi can support native Bitcoins by making minimal changes.\n\nThese Sushi smart contracts can be accessed from the Bitcoin network itself, so Bitcoin users don\u2019t even need to leave the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the increased liquidity from Bitcoin; it\u2019s about beginning a new chapter in DeFi, where we see more practical use cases of interoperability and enhanced connectivity,\u201d said Sushi\u2019s \u201chead chef\u201d Jared Grey in a statement.\n\nIn October, ZetaChain integrated with centralized exchange OKX\u2019s self-custodial wallet, allowing users to access dApps on various networks and to use their Bitcoins in dApps without the need for wrapping or bridging from the Bitcoin network itself.\n\nStarted in 2021 by serial entrepreneur Nandwani, ZetaChain announced its Series A funding round in August from investors from a range of backgrounds, including quantitative trading firm Jane Street Capital, crypto exchange Blockchain.com and China-focused early-stage VC firm Sky9."

        "content": "Polygon (MATIC) recently recorded a massive spike in fees, as standard gas spikes 13,250% to 4,005 gwei amid a remarkable increase in daily transactions to a yearly high above 6 million.\n\nData from Polygonscan, the official block explorer for the Polygon network, confirms these metrics. Gas on the Polygon network now stands at 4,005 gwei for standard transactions, representing a 13,250% increase from the average gas of 30 gwei.\n\nIn addition, gas fee on the network now sits at 4,220.5 gwei for fast transactions and 4,389 gwei for rapid transactions.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA \u201cgwei\u201d refers to a unit of measurement for gas prices on the Polygon blockchain. The network demands gas for when users aim to carry out operations or transactions on the chain. Gwei stands for gigawei, and it is a denomination of MATIC.\n\nDespite the recent massive spike in gas fees, the Polygon network, designed as a layer-2 chain atop Ethereum, retains its appeal of relatively lower gas fees than Ethereum. Notably, the 4,005 gwei fee translates to gas prices worth $0.08, data from Polygonscan confirms.\n\nFor context, Ethereum\u2019s gas fee still maintains a median value of 30 gwei. Despite being perceived as less than Polygon\u2019s due to the recent surge in Polygon gas fees, Ethereum still has a much higher fee. The 30 gwei translates to $1.30 in gas price, Etherscan data confirms.\n\nPossible Cause\n\nTraditionally, a spike in gas fees on a blockchain network is typically a product of network congestion. Increased transactions, driven by factors like DApp usage, token events, and external influences, contribute to rising gas fees on a network.\n\nThe primary catalyst of the surge in Polygon\u2018s gas fees is the inscription event of PRC-20 POLs on the Polygon blockchain and the ensuing massive increase in daily transactions, especially as recorded yesterday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPolygon generally boasts an average daily transaction figure of 2.25 million. However, this figure surged to 6,171,964 (6.17 million) yesterday, marking the highest number of daily transactions on Polygon this year. The last time Polygon saw this many transactions a day was in October 2021.\n\nAmid the surging transactions, as more participants vie for inclusion in limited block space, a competitive environment ensued, prompting users to offer higher gas prices to prioritize their transactions.\n\nPrimarily, as market participants mint PRC-20 POLs on Polygon, they aim for higher gas fees for priority treatment on the network.\n\nMeanwhile, MATIC is observing a discouraging decline in value, down 4% over the past 24 hours to $0.9047. Moreover, 24-hour trade volume has plummeted by 9.87% to $1,090,148,586."

        "content": "Discover crypto outlook of GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano. Explore meme-driven gains, versatile dApps, and academic research. Navigate Ethereum price fluctuations.\n\nEthereum Price Impact: GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano's Crypto Clash\n\nThe explosive growth of the crypto market has led to the emergence of numerous blockchain projects, each offering unique features and innovations. In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, investors and enthusiasts are constantly seeking the next big thing. The intriguing dynamics between three prominent players in the industry: GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano stay debatable with \u0650Ethereum price, which serves as the linchpin connecting these entities, intriguing both crypto investors and news followers.\n\nGameStop Memes: A New Player in the Crypto Arena\n\nGameStop Memes, a curious name in the crypto space, has recently caught the attention of investors and traders. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes operates on a unique premise. It leverages the power of meme culture, tapping into social media-driven investments.\n\nGameStop Memes is essentially a community-driven cryptocurrency project that utilizes meme content to drive interest and investment. It encourages crypto enthusiasts to engage in \"presale\" events. These presales involve early investors acquiring tokens before they are officially listed on exchanges; potentially leading to significant gains as the Ethereum price fluctuates.\n\nTRON: The Versatile Blockchain Platform\n\nTRON is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications on its network. It aims to provide an alternative to traditional web services by offering a decentralized, user-centric environment. This versatile platform has made its mark, standing as a robust competitor in the crypto arena.\n\nTRON has been a significant player in the blockchain industry for some time now. It differentiates itself by offering a versatile platform that can host a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). Understanding its role in the crypto world becomes crucial when exploring the Ethereum price's impact on this platform. Its utilization, however, is less reliant on the Ethereum price and more on the adoption of its platform.\n\nCardano: The Academic Blockchain\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform designed to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has gained recognition for its academic approach to blockchain technology, focusing on rigorous research and development.\n\nInvesting in Cardano is a more calculated and research-driven endeavor. While Ethereum price fluctuations may influence overall market sentiment, Cardano's success is closely tied to the academic rigor and technological advancements it represents.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes, TRON, and Cardano each bring a unique perspective to the table. GameStop Memes leverages meme culture and Ethereum price volatility to make its mark, while TRON provides a versatile platform for dApp development. Cardano, on the other hand, emphasizes academic research and development.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these entities depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. While GameStop Memes may offer quick, meme-driven gains. For those seeking opportunities within the crypto space, GameStop Memes offers a unique avenue. Given the constant fluctuations in Ethereum price, engaging in presale events might prove fruitful for early adopters.\n\nFind Out More About GameStop memes:\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "title": "2 Million presale in 24 hours: Can Gamestop memes compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin? - Businessday",
        "content": "In the forever changing landscape of the crypto market, alot of currencies emerged, captivating attention from investors and others who are keen to have an insight on the digital market. Ethereum and Bitcoin have been riding high waves since their launch. Among the superior crypto currencies, GameStop Memes, raised in 2021, to showcase a different narrative of the popular industry.\n\nGameStop Memes has blown away the digital market, by reflecting the power of social influence and trading. With the ongoing evolution of decentralised financial instruments. The new kid on the block, is aimed at reshaping perceptions, challenging the norms of the fintech while captivating a global audience.\n\nWhile it is still in the presale stage,the crypto currency has managed to raise 2 million in the last 24 hours, while increasing the stakes at the meme game. Gaining massive success, raises questions such as will it manage to devalue supreme currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum? To find out how it is a fine investment, make sure to read ahead till the last line.\n\nWhat Led GameStop Memes to an Instant 2 Million Benchmark?\n\nSuch higher revenue is a sign that Gamestop Memes are all set to wash out currencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. While being in its presale stage, the meme token has managed to earn such an amount not due to best Game Stock memes but due to these features:\n\nCommunity-Driven Approach\n\nBuilding a strong community that consists of crypto enthusiasts is a must if you want to see your tokens grow. With the similar approach Game Stock Meme managed to run an online community, that helped in hyping up the excitement, in its presale stage which led to increasing the demand among the investors, resulting in higher revenue.\n\nSocial Media Presence\n\nIn 2009, when Bitcoin hit the market, social media was the least popular platform to promote cryptos. Unlike Bitcoin, Gamestop Memes had an advantage of using popular social media platforms, such as X ( formerly known as Twitter) and Reddit, to connect with potential investors and build larger audiences.\n\nSecured and TrustWorthy Operations\n\nCrypto market is a place where trust is a fragile thing. For investors, it is important to know that their money is secured and invested in benefits, rather than loss. This major benefit is provided by Gamestop memes, as it operates on a protected blockchain foundation. Every transaction is recorded and verifiable, making it a safe place to invest.\n\nNew Tokonomics\n\nWith their vision rooted on the future, GameStop Memes makes sure the ecosystem is robust by integrating latest tokonomic features. Automatic liquidity and rewards for loyal holders make the token more stable and keep the community engaged. Keeping the innovative tokonomics in mind, the new meme token, is a better bargain compared to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market currently.\n\nCan Gamestop Memes Compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin ?\n\nWith the recent changes, it seems like the meme token can certainly compete with the superior coins in the market. However, Bitcoins, Ethereum and Gamestop Memes are as different as ice and water. Bitcoins, known as the oldest coin in the market, is seen as a hedge against inflation, while the new meme token tends to have the highest ROIs. Along with their benefits, there is a massive difference in bitcoin mining and the traditional meme token minings.\n\nFor bitcoins, miners use a special hardware, while for Gamestop Memes tokens, the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism is used. As for the Ethereum value, it is higher than meme tokens, but with GameStop Memes, gaining 2 million in the last 24 hours, is sure to change that very quickly. The price prediction is hard to make for the new token, as it is still in the presale stage. But with such a turn out, it is likely that it will be successful in taking over the oldies of the crypto market, and create more buzz for the meme tokens.\n\nWebsite: https://gamestopmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has continued to surge as we approach the end of 2023. The crypto giant is leading the pack out of the crypto winter that started in 2021. With this resurgence, Bitcoin is multiplying the number of millionaires it has created since its inception. It has been reported that over 80,000 accounts had at least $1 million USD worth of $BTC at the time of writing this article, as opposed to about 50,000 accounts at the beginning of 2023.\n\nWhile it is hard to be super bullish on the industry with all the uncertainty, many experts have tipped Ethereum ($ETH) and Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) as the next in line to make their holders millionaires. These projects are regarded by many as the best cryptos to invest in now and hold long.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is among the top 5 cryptocurrency projects in the world. It is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nEthereum ($ETH) is a decentralized platform for running smart contracts\u2014software that runs on a peer-to-peer network and is verified by blockchain.\n\nThe idea is to create secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant applications since they do not rely on centralized platforms.\n\nEthereum can be the underlying software layer for everything from decentralized finance applications to P2E games using NFTs.\n\nUltimately, many experts believe that Ethereum could underpin a reimagining of how the internet works, dubbed \u201cWeb3,\u201d in which internet control is disintermediated away from big companies such as Facebook and Amazon.\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX)\n\nGalaxy Fox ($GFOX) is the new utility token revolutionizing the P2E industry by allowing users to earn residual income by playing their favorite games.\n\nUsers can also stake their $GFOX tokens as Galaxy Fox offers rewards from the Galaxy Fox Stargate to users willing to maintain the network with their tokens.\n\nThe project also plans to launch its NFT collection with Galaxy Fox Ecosystem characters, enabling users to mint and trade 3,000 NFTs on popular NFT platforms such as OpenSea.\n\nThe Galaxy Fox marketplace has gained immense popularity as investors and analysts see it as one of the best cryptos to invest in now, with a promising future for the platform and its native $GFOX token.\n\nWith Galaxy Fox, investors are assured of the safety of their funds as the company has completed an audit through a top auditing firm, Crypto Hub.\n\nThere\u2019s massive potential for tremendous gains with Galaxy Fox. $GFOX is currently trading for $0.0066 in presale, and time is limited for early investors to buy the token at this price.\n\nInvesting early in an innovative project is the perfect combination to make lots of profit. And with Galaxy Fox, that notion rings true.\n\nDue to the high demand for the Galaxy Fox native token, $GFOX, during the ongoing presale, many crypto experts forecast that the token is one of the best cryptos to invest in now and that the price may reach 1000x by the end of 2023.\n\nLearn more about Galaxy Fox ($GFOX) here:\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"
