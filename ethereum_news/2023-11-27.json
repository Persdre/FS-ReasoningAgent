        "title": "Taiko's David Weisiger on revolutionizing Ethereum scalability [Q&A] - TechNode Global",
        "content": "In this TNGlobal Q&A, Taiko\u2019s Head of Developer Relations, David Weisiger, offers deep insights into innovative approaches to scaling Ethereum via Layer 2 solutions. Weisiger, a seasoned software engineer with a rich history at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace, brings a unique perspective to Taiko\u2019s mission. He elaborates on his decision to join the company, particularly driven its vision of minimal yet highly ambitious scaling of Ethereum. His commitment to contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in Taiko\u2019s efforts to maintain a \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d approach with their scaling solutions, highlighting their dedication to open-source development and collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s PSE team.\n\nThe conversation delves into the technical aspects of Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain technologies, clarifying their roles in the Ethereum network. Weisiger explains how Layer 2, particularly in the wake of network congestion and high transaction costs experienced in 2020 and 2021, has emerged as a crucial element in Ethereum\u2019s scalability roadmap, known as \u201cThe Surge.\u201d He discusses the company\u2019s approach to Layer 2 security, embracing multi-proofs and a minimal-change protocol to enhance auditability and reliability. Additionally, Weisiger touches on the broader implications of blockchain technology in the context of the global economy and geopolitical tensions, predicting significant developments in blockchain adoption and Ethereum scaling by 2024.\n\nTell us about your decision to join the Taiko team, and please describe how the company contributes to the ETH ecosystem.\n\nI already knew one of the co-founders from my time at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace as an engineer. Frankly, I joined because of the co-founders I interviewed, and I was sold on the highly ambitious and minimal scaling vision they had for Ethereum. To change as little as possible, and to simply scale Ethereum itself, no other changes\u2013just \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d. Additionally, I wanted to work on technology that would benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, from our contributions to the EF\u2019s PSE team to our completely open-source codebase.\n\nWhat is a Layer 1 and 2? And why is Layer 2 becoming more popular in recent years?\n\nEthereum is a Layer 1, it is the original blockchain we come to know as Ethereum which persists data and executes smart contracts. Layer 2 is a way of achieving scalability for Ethereum by representing more computation which happens off-chain into a compressed format, tapping into Ethereum as a permissionless data availability layer. This is because the cost of data storage on Ethereum is really expensive.\n\nL2s may scale the Ethereum L1 capacity by around 1,000 times and lower the transaction cost by a few 100 times. With the network congestion on the Ethereum network in 2020/2021 and high transaction costs during that period of time, it becomes very clear that L2 is the most important Ethereum scaling solution (Layer 2\u2019s has been a central part of the Ethereum roadmap as part of \u201cThe Surge\u201d). The concept of Layer 2 is always changing. We are challenging the traditional notion of what Layer 2 / Layer 3 is in our research and development of booster rollups.\n\nETH security is becoming an increasingly important topic so what has Taiko done to contribute and improve Layer 2?\n\nThere are several dimensions to security for Layer 2. One dimension is the proof system\u2013in this case, we have agreed with Vitalik\u2019s idea of utilizing multi-proofs. This means that we assume there is a bug in one implementation of a proof system so it\u2019s best to rely on multiple systems instead of just one. Additionally, we strive to make a minimal amount of changes in our protocol and client, both to be fully Ethereum-equivalent and also to make it more auditable.\n\nAnother dimension (in the spirit of minimalism) is reducing trust assumptions wherever we can. The first area that comes to mind is the fully permissionless proposing (this is referred to as a \u201cbased rollup\u201d) and fully permissionless proving.\n\nTaiko has contributed to the open-source development of the halo2 circuits along with others (mainly the EF\u2019s PSE team) and also contributes by open-sourcing our entire stack. Developers can use our client, protocol, etc. easily as it\u2019s all available and well-documented on GitHub.\n\nHow do you differentiate Taiko from other L2s?\n\nThe primary difference between Taiko and other L2s is that it is a based rollup, and fully permissionless to participate in. Anyone can propose a block or prove a block on our test net. Additionally, Taiko is Ethereum-equivalent, which means that we do not make any changes whatsoever to the developer environment\u2013put more technically, Taiko fully implements the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications (on the execution layer). Another difference is our innovative idea of utilizing booster rollups to natively scale Ethereum. Check out our CTO Brecht\u2019s EthResearch post on it!\n\nWhat are some examples of how your company helps its community and partners with its scaling solutions?\n\nWe develop our code totally in the open and also do many discussions and educational sessions publicly as well. We also love chatting with teams in the space that are very related to our protocol such as MEV, re-staking, block building, ZK proving, DAOs, etc. We enjoy participating in discussions about this and offering our insights!\n\nThe best example is definitely our research and development though. We believe we have great scaling ideas for Ethereum that others can use in their rollups or however they see fit.\n\nWhere do you see the broader crypto market going into 2024?\n\n2024 will be a very interesting year. There is a lot of risk in the global economy, and the geopolitical tension adds more uncertainty to it. There are always two sides to a coin, on one side the risk would affect the amount of capital coming into the crypto market, on the flip side blockchain and crypto are created trying to solve this exact problem and there\u2019ll be more use cases and demand for an alternative infrastructure to address the deglobalization. But one thing is sure, for the blockchain world to fulfill its mission and purpose, scaling is a must. And 2024 will be the year when Ethereum scaling becomes a reality and comes to fruition. I believe that no matter how the broader market is going to be, we\u2019ll see major adoption of blockchain technology."

        "content": "In an exclusive interview with Fortune, Vitalik Buterin, the brains behind Ethereum, shares his thoughts on everything from blockchain technology to AI to the people who most inspire him.\n\nHe also discusses what\u2019s happened since Ethereum\u2019s transition from proof of work to proof of stake and how spending time in Antarctica could help prepare humans\u2014maybe even him?\u2014for interplanetary travel.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nWhat use cases for blockchain excite you the most?\n\nThere are a few different categories of blockchain applications that I think can be valuable, and I wrote about some of these in a blog post last year, but a summary would be: One, currency applications are valuable, especially in the developing world. And two, identity, reputation, and decentralized social applications are exciting due to their potential network effects and enhanced security.\n\nGoing into the specifics of one application, I\u2019ve been using Farcaster a lot recently. There\u2019s a lot of interest in creating alternative stuff to Twitter now\u2014lots of people are either unhappy with various things that Elon does or people just realize that this is a monopoly and we need alternatives.\n\nSome of these have been on-chain. For example, my Farcaster account is connected to an Ethereum address, and if I lose my Farcaster key, I can use my Ethereum address to recover it. This is actually more secure than what centralized social media do, where they rely on phone numbers that can be hacked.\n\nOne of the big challenges in social media is how you tell who is a human and who is a bot. There\u2019s just lots of incentives for malicious actors to just create 50,000 bots. The nice thing about Ethereum is that it already has this lively on-chain ecosystem where there are different ways of doing that.\n\nOne is you can verify just the existence of activity on an Ethereum account. To have activity, you need to pay transaction fees, so there\u2019s a cost. You can make a few hundred fake accounts if you can pay a cost, but you can\u2019t make a million of them.\n\nSecond, you can look at POAPs [proof-of-attendance protocols] that verify that you participated in various in-person or online events.\n\nThird, there are proof-of-personhood protocols, and there is proof of humanity like Worldcoin. There\u2019s a Gitcoin passport that aggregates a lot of those. The ideal goal here is to do this in a way that lets people prove that they are people and not bots, but is also compatible with the goal of preserving people\u2019s privacy.\n\nLast year, you experienced the milestone of transitioning Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. What are you focused on now, and then what\u2019s next?\n\nAccount abstraction is definitely a big and important one. Another thing is obviously scalability. We have EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which is coming out very soon, which basically adds more data space on the blockchain\u2014not transactions, but just blobs of data. The purpose of this is to enable greater scalability, specifically for layer-2 projects, our rollups.\n\nThen after EIP-4844 there is a longer-term road map of increasing that amount of space over time and then ongoing improvements to proof of stake in identifying ways that we can improve decentralization even further.\n\nWe talked a year ago about AI, the intersection of AI and blockchain, before the release of ChatGPT and all the hype around that. What are your current views on the AI industry?\n\nAI is obviously super important. It\u2019s the sort of thing that\u2019s hard to think about because it\u2019s so hard to predict where it might go in the future. It\u2019s massive gains in productivity, but also massive philosophical consequences just in terms of what the role of humans in this new world is going to be. The world that is controlled by AI has completely different goals from us in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect at first\u2014that could also lead to very bad things happening.\n\nIn terms of the intersection between AI and crypto, this is one of those things where people have tried really hard to find an answer. Unfortunately, part of the answer is just that the intersection is less than it seems. There are a few things like ZK ML [zero-knowledge machine learning], but it\u2019s realistically a pretty small area.\n\nThere is the fact that AI\u2019s rapid growth makes it much more important to solve certain problems, like proof of personhood, for example. Then there\u2019s obviously the possibility of just crypto tokens being used by AIs. There is the possibility of crypto-based DAOs governing AIs and the process of training AIs.\n\nHave you read any books in the last year that have inspired you?\n\nIn the last year, I have definitely done less books and more reading blogs and things on the internet, things like podcasts and even science fiction. Maybe 10 years ago I read a lot of Austrian economics literature and things like Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, but also things like The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a novel by Robert A. Heinlein about a society that creates a civilization on the moon and tries to gain independence.\n\nMuch more recently, I watched some of The Three-Body Problem\u2014I read part of the novel and I also watched part of the TV series, and I was fascinated by that because it presents its world view in a way that is totally different from things that we\u2019re used to. There are aspects to the world view that I disagree with. There\u2019s always this mentality that the world is super dangerous and basically the five big countries have to get together and figure things out, and no one else gets a seat at the table.\n\nThat\u2019s not the kind of world that I want, and not the kind of mentality that I want to see get bigger. But there is this aspect of appreciating the vastness of the universe and how lucky humanity is to have been born\u2014and how significant and how small we are at the same time.\n\nAre there people you admire, who inspire you?\n\nA lot of people. Akira Fuyuno has a blog called Samurai Novelist. It\u2019s not a book, but his posts are so long, they\u2019re basically like the equivalent of reading 10 books. He just does a very good job of making really important philosophical concepts understandable and talking about just all kinds of things in science and politics in deep ways. Other people have told me that my writing style is inspired by his.\n\nI kind of have to say Volodymyr Zelensky. I appreciate his soft-power leadership and his ability to be a figure who rallies and inspires people in that way\u2014like, not just giving out the orders, but just being the face and rallying people behind the cause.\n\nThen there are Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott Alexander\u2014the two of them are kind of similar characters in a lot of ways. Also, within the Ethereum community, Justin Drake, Dankrad Feist, and Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation\u2019s executive director, who\u2019s really pushed the philosophy of subtraction\u2014different people who have stepped up and made a piece of Ethereum their own and put their souls into making that piece as great as possible.\n\nYou\u2019ve also mentioned Steve Wozniak. Can you tell us more about meeting him? And maybe a few other people who\u2019ve impressed you?\n\nSteve Wozniak, he was just a genuinely fascinating guy who had really interesting hobbies and a lot of cool things that he was able to tell me about.\n\nFrom the government, Audrey Tang, Taiwan\u2019s digital minister, she had all kinds of interesting ideas of her own. She has her own history of being involved in Taiwan\u2019s democracy movement and then g0v [gov zero], which is trying to create a more democratic e-government infrastructure in Taiwan.\n\nThe likely new prime minister of Montenegro, Milojko Spaji\u0107, a.k.a. Mickey, I\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m also impressed by him. From what I can tell, it\u2019s his dedication to making the country better and also just being a curious person who was willing to talk to me and willing to learn things about crypto.\n\nDo you use ChatGPT or any other AI tools?\n\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT. I\u2019ve also used the Stability AI chat. I use that for a few things. One is asking specific questions that I want answers for; another one is for writing code. I find that the thing that ChatGPT is best at is writing code that uses APIs or libraries or tools that you did not really know about. It even sometimes can take natural language tasks and convert them.\n\nAlso, for a translation, ChatGPT often does better than even Google Translate for helping to learn languages. If I want to understand the grammar behind a particular sentence, it does a really good job of doing that. The things that it\u2019s less good at are basically things where there aren\u2019t many millions of examples to learn from.\n\nI use either Stable Diffusion or the various other AI drawing things to draw images. I use those images and things in, like, my posts and my slides quite a bit. That has been it so far, but I\u2019m sure as AI gets better, I\u2019ll use it in other places as well.\n\nIt definitely does increase my productivity by quite a bit.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest dream?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. I feel like I\u2019m not the sort of person to have one dream. I\u2019m the sort of person to have a lot of dreams. I dream of a world where I can be more free and more open, and where the tools that we\u2019re building in the crypto space can be a big part of actually making that happen. I have a dream of humanity as a whole really succeeding and ending disease and becoming a multiple-energy-area civilization.\n\nSpeaking of civilization, do you think in the future we can travel between planets? And would you take that ride to space?\n\nI think we\u2019ll absolutely get there. I will not be the first one to go\u2014I might be the hundredth person to go. Before we\u2019re really ready to do space, we need to get better at doing Antarctica first. I think of Antarctica as being the tutorial ground of going into space, because it\u2019s an environment that\u2019s definitely somewhat harsh and you have zero infrastructure, but you still can breathe the air without wearing a helmet. Start with the simpler things. But I would definitely love to actually be a part of that myself at some point over the next few decades."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin: If AI Turns on Us 'Even Mars May Not Be Safe' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin reflected on his own take on \u201ctechno-optimism,\u201d inspired by Marc Andreessen, who opined about AI in his Techno-Optimist Manifesto in October. While Buterin agreed with Andreessen\u2019s positive outlook, Buterin also noted the importance of how AI is developed and the technology's future direction.\n\nButerin acknowledged the existential risk of artificial intelligence, including causing the extinction of the human race.\n\n\u201cThis is an extreme claim: as much harm as the worst-case scenario of climate change, or an artificial pandemic or a nuclear war, might cause, there are many islands of civilization that would remain intact to pick up the pieces,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut a superintelligent AI, if it decides to turn against us, may well leave no survivors and end humanity for good,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cEven Mars may not be safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin pointed to a 2022 survey by AI Impacts, which said between 5% and 10% of participants believe humans face extinction from AI or from humans' failure to control AI, respectively. He said that a security-focused open-source movement is ideal for leading AI development rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\n\n\u201cIf we want a future that is both superintelligent and \"human\u2014one where human beings are not just pets, but actually retain meaningful agency over the world\u2014then it feels like something like this is the most natural option,\" he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed, Buterin continued, is the active human intention to choose its direction and outcome. \u201cThe formula of 'maximize profit' will not arrive at them automatically,\u201d he said.\n\nButerin said he loves technology because it expands human potential, pointing to the history of innovations from hand tools to smartphones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI believe that these things are deeply good, and that expanding humanity's reach even further to the planets and stars is deeply good, because I believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nButerin said that while he believes transformative technology will lead to a brighter future for humanity, he rejects the notion that the world should stay how it is today, only with less greed and more public healthcare.\n\n\u201cThere are certain types of technology that much more reliably make the world better than other types of technology,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cThere are certain types of technology that could, if developed, mitigate the negative impacts of other types of technology.\u201d\n\nButerin cautioned about a rise in digital authoritarianism and surveillance technology used against those who defy or dissent against the government, controlled by a small cabal of technocrats. He said the majority of people would rather see highly advanced AI delayed by a decade rather than be monopolized by a single group.\n\n\u201cMy basic fear is that the same kinds of managerial technologies that allow OpenAI to serve over a hundred million customers with 500 employees will also allow a 500-person political elite, or even a 5-person board, to maintain an iron fist over an entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Buterin said he is sympathetic to the effective acceleration (also known as \"e/acc\") movement, he has mixed feelings about its enthusiasm for military technology.\n\n\u201cEnthusiasm about modern military technology as a force for good seems to require believing that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future,\u201d he said, citing the idea that military technology is good because it's being built and controlled by America and America is good.\n\n\u201cDoes being an e/acc require being an America maximalist, betting everything on both the government's present and future morals and the country's future success?\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin cautioned against giving \u201cextreme and opaque power\u201d to a small group of people with the hope they will use it wisely, preferring instead a philosophy of \"d/acc\"\u2014or defense, decentralization, democracy, and differential. This mindset, he said, could adapt to effective altruists, libertarians, pluralists, blockchain advocates, and solar and lunar punks.\n\n\u201cA defense-favoring world is a better world, for many reasons,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cFirst of course is the direct benefit of safety: fewer people die, less economic value gets destroyed, less time is wasted on conflict.\n\n\"What is less appreciated though is that a defense-favoring world makes it easier for healthier, more open and more freedom-respecting forms of governance to thrive,\" he concluded.\n\nWhile he emphasized the need to build and accelerate, Buterin said society should regularly ask what we are accelerating towards. Buterin suggested that the 21st century may be \"the pivotal century\" for humanity that could decide the fate of humanity for millennia.\n\n\u201cThese are challenging problems,\u201d Buterin said. \u201cBut I look forward to watching and participating in our species' grand collective effort to find the answers.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The introduction of Ethereum Foundation\u2019s ERC-4337 account abstraction standard earlier this year drew much attention, but adoption and retention are off to a slow start.\n\nExisting hardware wallets rely on a pair of keys. If those keys are compromised, so are tokens in the wallet. The ERC-4337 standard was instead intended as a new baseline for how users interact with crypto wallets services, including social recovery mechanisms and other multisig options.\n\nThe standard turns Ethereum accounts into \u201csmart accounts,\u201d which are much more flexible to suit the needs of wallet holders.\n\nAccording to data on BundleBear:\n\nWeekly retention for ERC-4337 smart wallets drops as low as 1% for accounts older than five weeks.\n\nAn average smart account only sends five user operations.\n\nRevenue for transaction \u201cbundlers\u201d is also low, currently less than $8,000 per week.\n\nRead more: What Are Smart Contract Wallets? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nAt the time of writing, daily active users are at around 3%, sixdegree data shows. Most smart account users today are on the Polygon network, making up over 66% of all smart account holders and almost all monthly new users by chain.\n\nDespite the low adoption rates on Ethereum, industry participants remain optimistic about the future of smart accounts and have been actively working on proposals to spur usage.\n\nJohn Rising, the co-founder of Stackup, an account abstraction infrastructure company, notes that many existing issues with ERC-4337 can be resolved with the first-ever Rollup Improvement Proposal, RIP-7560.\n\nThe existing ERC-4337 standard is considered a \u201csemi-native+\u201d smart account, where a user does not need a private key because the trustless relay network is designed to forward transactions to the blockchain.\n\nRising believes that the goal is to move towards a \u201cnative\u201d smart account, where accounts would be able to specify their own validation logic, completely removing the need for a private key \u2014 something that RIP-7560 hopes to do.\n\n\u201cERC-4337 has always been intended as a stepping stone to native account abstraction. The account abstraction proposal, RIP-7560, is designed to be backwards compatible with ERC-4337,\u201d Rising told Blockworks.\n\nFurther discussions around the proposal and its applicability must still be considered. Native account abstraction has drawn concerns over the complexity it adds, as it introduces consensus layer changes rather than just high-level infrastructure layer modifications.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing strong performance, currently trading around $2,000, with predictions of reaching its all-time high of over $4,800.\n\nAnalyst FieryTrading forecasts ETH to reach nearly $5,000 by early 2025, citing a long-term bullish pattern.\n\nThe same analyst predicts a significant rise for Cardano\u2019s ADA, expecting it to exceed $35 by 2025 based on bullish market patterns.\n\n\u2018Big Gains for ETH\u2019 on the Horizon?\n\nEthereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 is another asset that has shown strong resilience following the devastating market crash in the second part of 2022. It currently trades at around $2,000 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), a 70% price increase compared to the first day of the ongoing year.\n\nSome analysts believe the current condition is just the beginning of an uptrend that could eventually take ETH to its all-time high of over $4,800. Such an individual is the one using the TradingView handle FieryTrading.\n\nAccording to them, the coin has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the following months.\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions,\u201d the analyst argued.\n\nAccording to their analysis, Ether\u2019s jump toward almost $5,000 is expected at the beginning of 2025. \u201cWith a stop below the recent swing low and a target around the current ATH, we can construct a very decent long-term trade for this big token,\u201d FieryTrading concluded.\n\nThe Analyst\u2019s Take on ADA\n\nApart from predicting ETH\u2019s possible price trajectory, FieryTrading has also given their two cents on Cardano\u2019s native token \u2013 ADA.\n\nThey believe the asset is poised for an astonishing increase toward $35 in two years based on certain parallel channels that hint about the beginning of a bull run:\n\n\u201cSince the pattern has now been confirmed, we can take a look at the next bull-market top. Assuming that the bull-market top will be somewhere in 2025 and that ADA will continue to follow this pattern, we can make the assumption that ADA will top somewhere above $35.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum price may lose $2,000 level as ETH becomes deflationary again due to validator exit - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price, trading at $2,038 on Tuesday, will likely fall below the crucial support level amid waning bullishness.\n\nETH validators, for the first time since Shapella's hard fork, have begun exiting to the tune of 1,018 per day.\n\nETH issuance has also taken a hit and, for the first time since December 2022, has recently had its growth rate decreased by 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum price has been affected by the Shanghai hardfork since even before it was activated. But since the upgrade, this week marks the first instance when the market is witnessing the fear of unstaking come to life.\n\nEthereum price could take a bearish turn\n\nEthereum price has been hovering around the $2,000 mark since the beginning of the month. Trading at $2,038 at the time of writing, the second-generation cryptocurrency has failed to breach the resistance of $2,124 for the second time this month. While it did manage to break out of the downtrend over the past week, it is still vulnerable to a decline below the $2,000 support level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a measure of the speed and change of price movement. According to the indicator, there is still room for ETH to bounce back and reinitiate bullish momentum, given it is sitting above the neutral line at 50.0. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also exhibiting the dominance of bearish momentum in the market presently, owing to the red bars on the histogram and the lack of a potential bullish crossover.\n\nThus, all the fingers point at a likely downtrend, which might see Ethereum price touching the lows of $1,900 or testing the support at $1,795.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nBut if the broader market cues turn bullish and ETH bounces back from $2,000, it could make another attempt at breaching the resistance marked at $2,124. A rise through that level would invalidate the bearish thesis, opening ETH up to tagging $2,200.\n\nEthereum turns deflationary again\n\nThe chance of a bullish turn of events is both likely and unlikely. It's likely because ETH is deflationary once again. An asset being deflationary simply means that it no longer has an infinite supply but that it will reduce over time. This generally is a bullish event since low supply plus high demand equals a rise in price.\n\nBut the reason it could be unlikely in the case of Ethereum is that the conditions under which ETH is turning deflationary are unfavorable. According to blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, daily ETH issuance has experienced a slowdown. Over the last week, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day.\n\nEthereum daily issuance\n\nThis marks the first issuance decrease in nearly 12 months, and the reason behind it is the exit of validators. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum runs on the Proof of Stake consensus method, which requires node/block validators to stake ETH in order to qualify. Earlier, this staked ETH could not be withdrawn, but that feature was activated after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nSince then, on average, 380 validators have exited on a daily basis. But this figure shot up by 168% in just a month, rising to 1,018 validators.\n\nEthereum validators\n\nConsequently, the staked ETH has also noted a decline. The possibility of the validator exit could be due to one or more of these three possible reasons:\n\nInvestors are opting to change their staking setup, for example, by transferring stakes from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to Liquid Staking Providers (perhaps due to ongoing regulatory concerns).\n\nInvestors with access to US capital markets may be rotating capital toward safer assets, such as US treasuries, as interest rates remain elevated relative to ETH staking returns.\n\nInvestors may also be seeking greater liquidity for held ETH in anticipation of an imminent market uptrend rather than less liquid-staked ETH.\n\nNevertheless, this is not a good sign for Ethereum as the validators are the backbone of the network, and their exit could prove to be rather negative."

        "title": "Ethereum: A Buy Opportunity Is Underway! - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Broad markets and cryptocurrencies are preparing for more volatility, as explained in Leading Indicators Confirming A Pullback Is Underway. The intensity will not be like June nor September of last year, it will be closer to the December pullback. That said, we can clearly see that the next wave of selling will come with a buy opportunity in Ethereum (ETH). This is consistent with our crypto predictions for 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, we predicted that leading indicator Bitcoin was unable to move higher. As explained in Bitcoin: Resolution Comes After Chart Tension Is Cleared:\n\nThat said, what do we see on the Bitcoin chart currently? First, BTC did hit resistance, strong resistance. Any market that is unable to clear resistance will move back to support before it can re-attack resistance. Second, several trendlines coincide in the 19-22k area in the period February & March. This is the \u2018tension\u2019 we were talking about in our introduction. As seen, as of April, there is only one trendline above 22k which suggests that IF Bitcoin is able to get back to 23k in April/May it should be able to clear that resistance level.\n\nWhen both time and price meet resistance, when there is tension on the chart in that time/price combination, there is simply no way that a market can move higher.\n\nIt\u2019s a very simple principle that most investors nor analysts are able to \u2018see\u2019 although it\u2019s there, on the chart, visible, for anyone with an open mind.\n\nThat said, the Ethereum chart is also pretty clear. What we observe is straightforward:\n\nThe 1549-1658 area has lots of resistance. It\u2019s the 3d attempt of Ethereum to clear this area since last summer. We suspect that the 4th attempt will come with a breakout, but only in 4 to 6 weeks from now. Everything will depend on how low ETH will fall. If support at 1336 will hold, in March, we are convinced that ETH will clear 1658 not later than April of this year.\n\nOverall, what we do like most about the Ethereum chart, other than the \u2018details\u2019 outlined above, is that tension is disappearing. The candles are getting smoother, the candles are smaller, the volatility is disappearing. Needless to say, if volatility will pick up (which we expect to happen in the next few weeks) the picture might change but you can clearly see how this current period is getting smoother, certainly when compared to last summer and fall.\n\nIn our crypto research service, we will be tracking relative strength in our watchlist of 30 tokens. We also do expect to hit at least one unicorn (a multi-bagger) before the start of the summer."

        "title": "How to explore blockchains - DLNews",
        "content": "Back in 2009, Bitcoin was the only blockchain. Fast-forward 15 years and add tens of billions of dollars of investor cash, and now there are thousands of them.\n\nWith so many different blockchains out there, knowing how to compare them and across what metrics is essential for investors and users alike.\n\nThis article explores how to use DefiLlama to compare blockchains and why doing so matters.\n\nHow to compare blockchains\n\nDefiLlama harvests public data to keep tabs on the inflows and outflows of money across hundreds of blockchains.\n\nTo access it, go to the DefiLlama website and click the Compare Chains tab under the DeFi dashboards section.\n\nUsers can pit blockchains against each other and compare them across several metrics, like total value locked, fees and revenue, active users, and transaction count.\n\nTotal Value Locked\n\nIn the context of blockchains, TVL refers to the total value of cryptocurrency that is deposited into smart contracts on a particular blockchain.\n\nA higher blockchain TVL is usually a reflection of its popularity with investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHowever, TVL can sometimes be misleading.\n\nFor example, Ethereum\u2019s TVL is much higher than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 even though Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is triple that of Ethereum.\n\nThe higher TVL is down to Ethereum\u2019s greater support for smart contracts. DeFi protocols built using complex smart contracts, such as decentralised exchanges and lending protocols, have attracted tens of billions of dollars of deposits.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s TVL is minuscule because of its limited support for smart contracts.\n\nThe total value locked on the Bitcoin blockchain is tiny compared to Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nFees and revenue\n\nWhile TVL is still a great way to gauge a blockchain\u2019s popularity at a glance, looking at other metrics within the Compare Chains dashboard can help create a more complete comparison.\n\nComparing the fees and revenue two blockchains create can yield insights into not only user activity, but also how financially sustainable they are.\n\nLet\u2019s use DefiLlama to compare Ethereum and Optimism.\n\nHere we can see a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees go back to the network as revenue \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case these fees are burned. On Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 network, a much smaller proportion of its fees are kept as revenue.\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum layer 2, makes less revenue than the blockchain it is built on top of. (DefiLlama)\n\nThat is because Optimism has to pay the Ethereum network it is built on top of to confirm transactions. The majority of transaction fees Optimism charges users are paid to Ethereum, while Optimism keeps what\u2019s left.\n\nEven so, Optimism, along with other Ethereum layer 2 networks, produce millions of dollars of revenue each month.\n\nActive users and transactions\n\nThe Active Users and Transactions metrics are powerful in and of themselves. But when combined they can reveal deeper insights into the behaviour of the users on different blockchains.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s compare the active users on Polygon and Ethereum. On DefiLlama, the active users metric is synonymous with active wallet addresses.\n\nPolygon, a blockchain with lower transaction fees, has more active addresses than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nAs we can see in the example, Polygon has a little over 60,000 more active addresses than Ethereum does.\n\nNext, let\u2019s compare transactions.\n\nPolygon also processes many more transactions than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nHere we can see Polygon processes almost three times the number of transactions Ethereum does.\n\nNow, let\u2019s combine these two comparisons.\n\nBy dividing daily transactions by daily active addresses on Nov. 15, we find that each Polygon address made an average of 7.7 transactions.\n\nOn Ethereum, however, each address only made an average of 3.5 transactions.\n\nSo, what might be behind this difference? Well, Ethereum transaction fees are much higher than those on Polygon, which could be one influence.\n\nBut be careful when comparing transactions \u2014 not all blockchains allow for a fair comparison.\n\nFor example, Solana\u2019s transaction count is much higher than any other blockchain DefiLlama lists. Is this because Solana users are just more active? Maybe not.\n\nIt\u2019s actually because around 85% of all Solana transactions are from validators communicating with each other every time the network creates a new block. Such transactions happen automatically to keep the blockchain running.\n\nWhy are blockchains different from each other?\n\nAside from popularity and marketing, there are fundamental differences between blockchains based on what they\u2019re trying to achieve.\n\nA lot of what makes a specific blockchain unique can be boiled down to its approach to solving the so-called blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma posits that blockchains want to achieve sufficient security, scalability and decentralisation, but can only ever solve any two at the same time by sacrificing the third.\n\nIn the context of blockchains, security, scalability and decentralisation are defined as follows:\n\nSecurity. Some blockchains are better at safeguarding assets and data than others due to different consensus mechanisms \u2013 how blockchain transactions are validated.\n\nSome blockchains are better at safeguarding assets and data than others due to different consensus mechanisms \u2013 how blockchain transactions are validated. Scalability. Some blockchains can handle more transactions than others, making them better suited for sudden surges in use that bring in a tidal wave of traffic.\n\nSome blockchains can handle more transactions than others, making them better suited for sudden surges in use that bring in a tidal wave of traffic. Decentralisation. Some blockchains are more decentralised than others. In more decentralised networks, control and consensus rests in the hands of the community; in less decentralised networks, a smaller group of people call the shots.\n\nA fast blockchain that can process lots of transactions at once might have to sacrifice decentralisation to achieve those high speeds. Conversely, some blockchains sacrifice speed and transaction throughput to maintain higher security.\n\nDecentralisation, though, is what sets blockchains apart from other payment networks. Truly decentralised networks minimise centralised weak points and are more resistant to censorship. The most decentralised blockchains are public blockchains, like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, some networks, known as private blockchains, happily forsake decentralisation for speed and security. These networks, such as the ConsenSys Quorum or Sygnum\u2019s Desygnate, are invite-only.\n\nPrivate blockchains\u2019 security and speed is top-notch, but only for a select group of users. There are usually just a handful of companies that validate and view transactions.\n\nNext steps\n\nCompare active users and transactions across different blockchains and find out which ones have the most active users.\n\nInvestigate different approaches to the blockchain trilemma and read about those who claim to have solved the problem."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum's cofounder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an ambitious redesign for the Ethereum network, which, if implemented, could have profound implications for users and developers. Speaking at Devconnect in Turkey, Buterin outlined a strategy to enhance Ethereum staking and address performance issues that have been persistent thorns in the network's side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin's vision includes integrating private mempools and ERC-4337. Private mempools could offer users enhanced privacy and security by allowing them to conduct transactions without exposing their intentions to the public mempool where miners could see and potentially exploit them. ERC-4337 refers to account abstraction, allowing users to have more sophisticated control over their accounts, with operations like multisig wallets becoming easier to implement and more secure.\n\nCode precompilation is another feature Buterin is keen on integrating. This could potentially increase the efficiency of smart contract deployment, making them quicker and cheaper to execute by preprocessing some elements of the code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiquid staking, a process that allows stakers to liquify staked (or locked) assets, is a feature Buterin wants to see improved. He has expressed concerns over the centralization of liquid staking solutions, which could be a risk for the network if too much control is in the hands of a few entities like Lido Finance. Decentralizing this aspect could democratize the staking process, giving more users the chance to participate without relinquishing liquidity.\n\nThe redesign Buterin proposes would likely make Ethereum more scalable, secure and efficient. These changes could lower the barriers to entry for new users and developers, fostering a more inclusive and robust ecosystem. The exact impact on Ethereum's price and the broader crypto market is speculative, but typically, improvements that address fundamental issues and enhance usability bode well for the network's value and adoption."

The thoughtful, unassuming creator and intellectual figurehead of the Ethereum ecosystem was largely pushed out of headlines by bombastic, performative (and fraudulent) caricatures like Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBut with such charlatans and their allies now discredited well beyond crypto circles, Buterin is back in a big way with a lengthy essay he published on Monday entitled \u201cMy techno-optimism.\u201d Though the message is broad, it arrives as a specific response to the recent public rift at OpenAI. That fight was broadly driven by a split between \u201cEffective Altruists,\u201d or EAs \u2013 the group Sam Bankman-Fried allied with and helped fund \u2013 and \u201cEffective Accelerationists,\u201d or (e/acc), a far more free-market oriented faction that includes people like Marc Andreessen.\n\nIn the recent OpenAI leadership fight, the EAs seemingly took the role of techno-pessimists, trying to slow the spread of AI tools, while the \u201ce/acc\u201d faction backed Sam Altman\u2019s focus on growth. But Buterin sees both sides as having \u201cfar too many plans to save the world that involve giving a small group of people extreme and opaque power and hoping that they use it wisely.\u201d As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, the two factions are branches of the same underlying Silicon Valley ideology, and both have deep conceptual flaws that ultimately sum out to authoritarianism.\n\nButerin\u2019s response appears in many ways far more nuanced than the positions he is reacting to. He calls it \u201cd/acc,\u201d or \u201cdefensive accelerationism.\u201d\n\nWhat is Defensive Accelerationism?\n\nButerin\u2019s counterpoint leans most of all on decentralization and democratic decision-making in the management of human progress. Buterin says that \u201cThe \u2018d\u2019 stands for \u2018defensive acceleration,\u2019 or perhaps decentralized, or differential acceleration.\u201d It could just as easily, based on Buterin\u2019s ideas, stand for \u201cdemocratic accelerationism.\u201d\n\nVitalik argues that those various Ds are linked. A society that develops in a \u201cdefensive\u201d way is a more just and fair one, because its decentralization discourages attacking others, in turn leaving democracy free to flourish \u2013 at the local or small-group level specifically. He uses the example of Switzerland, whose mountainous terrain historically helped it maintain a more horizontal and localized system of political power, since the various sub-national polities can\u2019t easily attack each other, or be attacked.\n\nIn more contemporary technological terms, Buterin specifically emphasizes privacy and autonomy, as well as cybersecurity and \u201cinfosecurity\u201d as key principles of development on \u201cd/acc\u201d lines. He fully endorses \u201ca security-focused open-source movement, rather than closed and proprietary corporations and venture capital funds.\u201d This seems a specific knock on the EAs, who have been resistant to making AI tech more accessible.\n\nOn a related note, Buterin seems viscerally repulsed by the \u201centhusiasm for military technology\u201d among the effective accelerationist crowd. On this point, he accuses the e/accs of making the same egotistical mistake as the EAs: Supporting the advancement of military tech, Buterin writes, requires \u201cbelieving that the dominant technological power will reliably be one of the good guys in most conflicts, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe essay also explores other important topics, like pandemic preparedness, and lays out decentralized approaches. At a very high level, Buterin praises systems like prediction markets and X/Twitter\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d feature, specifically because they\u2019re structured to usefully integrate feedback from any member of the public. No surprise, Buterin also emphasizes the value of blockchains and cryptocurrency in his notion of digital \u201cdefensive infrastructure,\u201d for instance for their ability to prevent centralized \u201cchokepoints\u201d for data.\n\nButerin\u2019s \u201cD\u201d does not, crucially, stand for \u201cdeceleration.\u201d He opens the essay with a strong argument for technological progress as a boon to human well-being, and explicitly connects that to the beneficial potential of artificial intelligence. And though he also accepts the risk of superintelligence dominating human life, he thankfully gives short shrift to the sci-fi fantasies of destructive AI that seem to haunt the Effective Altruists and their \u201cAI Doomer\u201d allies. He\u2019s far more concerned with the realistic, here-and-now threat of AI turning humans into passive \u201cpets,\u201d simply because the AIs will make objectively better decisions.\n\nA \u2018Subspecies of e/acc\u2019\n\nBut even given such risks, Buterin rejects the idea that any small group \u2013 like the OpenAI board \u2013 should control technological progress. Notably, this echoes close to a decade of Buterin\u2019s own proactive efforts to reduce his own power over Ethereum. He rightly identifies reliance on central authority as an implicit element of contemporary Effective Altruism, and generally he seems to have the least affection for that set of ideas.\n\nButerin is more clearly allied with the \u201ceffective accelerationists,\u201d and calls d/acc \u201ca subspecies of e/acc \u2013 just one that is much more selective and intentional.\u201d But he rightly pushes back against their most extremist tendency, too \u2013 their belief that unstructured \u201cfree markets\u201d in themselves lead to human progress. Buterin\u2019s objections here include the uncontroversial fact that \u201cmany markets have proven to be natural monopolies.\u201d Following the e/acc free-market doctrine, he writes, seems likely to lead to a monopoly on artificial intelligence specifically, with disastrous implications for human freedom and flourishing.\n\nThere\u2019s much more breadth and subtlety to Buterin\u2019s dense disquisition \u2013 for instance, he includes transhumanist ideas like brain-computer interfaces in his idea of \u201cdefensive\u201d technological development. But it\u2019s not hard to see \u201cd/acc\u201d as a rebranding of the left-wing libertarianism that has come to define the political ethos of the Ethereum community. Buterin\u2019s pitch also reflects the same basic optimism and openness that defines the actually-existing Ethereum community today.\n\n\u201cI believe humanity is deeply good,\u201d Vitalik writes in closing. \u201cYes, human beings are often mean, but we much more often show kindness and mercy, and work together for our common benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo billion years from now, if the Earth or any part of the universe still bears the beauty of Earthly life, it will be human artifices like space travel and geoengineering that will have made it happen,\u201d Buterin continues.\n\n\u201cWe need to build, and accelerate.\u201d"

        "content": "One of the most important figures in the digital asset sector, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared his intention to redesign the entire network. Indeed, Buterin spoke in Turkey where he discussed plans that would bring widespread changes to users across the network.\n\nMoreover, Buterin had outlined an overall strategy that he would seek to employ for those changes. Specifically, they would target an enhancement to the staking of ETH, and performance issues that have occurred regarding addresses. The latter has notably been an issue for the network in years past.\n\nSource: CoinDesk\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Says He Hasn\u2019t Sold Ethereum (EHT) Since 2018\n\nButerin Seeking to Implement Widespread Changes to Ethereum\n\nWithin the mainstream perception of digital assets, two tokens reign supreme. Specifically, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have become staples for the industry. Subsequently, those connected to the assets have become some of its most important entities. Now, one of those individuals is set to bring forth massive changes to one network.\n\nSpeaking at Devconnect in Turkey, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delved into his plans to redesign the network. Specifically, Wu Blockchain reported that the changes to the platform are connected to staking and performance concerns. Ultimately, any issues would have widespread changes in the user experience.\n\nVitalik Buterin stated at the Devconnect in Turkey that he plans to redesign Ethereum staking and solve problems affecting performance. He recognizes the UTXO payment model and hopes to integrate private mempools, ERC-4337, code pre-compilation, ZK-EVMs and liquid staking in\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 27, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Founder Discusses ETH Staking Changes\n\nThe plans Buterin is seeking to set in motion include the integration of private mempools and ERC-4337. Indeed, the former would bring about greater security and privacy to the operating network. This would be done through the authorization of transactions without the intentions being displayed to the public mempool. therefore, they would be far less a target of potential exploits.\n\nSubseuqnlety, ERC-4337 is related to account abstraction, and giving users more control over their own accounts. Therefore, things like multisig wallets become far easier to implement, and far more secure for users. Altogether, these plans are geared toward pushing the network forward and encouraging the protection of users across its operations."

Discover SCENE\n\nMagic Eden sees a crypto future that spans multiple blockchains\u2014and is launching its crypto wallet browser extension in closed beta to support that aim, the firm behind the NFT marketplace announced Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a multi-chain world for NFTs,\u201d Magic Eden CEO and co-founder Jack Lu told Decrypt in an interview.\n\n\u201cUp until today, for a user to really experience all the different products and features and great content that we have on every chain, they effectively have to download three wallets,\u201d Lu said of the current challenges plaguing the wallet space that have led to user fragmentation on Magic Eden.\n\nThe marketplace\u2019s crypto wallet is launching for the Google Chrome browser first, but a Safari browser version and mobile app are also in the works. The mobile app could come into fruition as soon as early 2024, Lu shared.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wallet will be compatible with the four blockchains that Magic Eden currently supports on its NFT marketplace: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe initial Magic Eden wallet will be self-custodied, meaning users will have full control over their crypto assets and will have to keep a seed phrase\u2014a lengthy passphrase consisting of many words\u2014secure.\n\nBut if downloading three different crypto wallets to buy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin is frustrating and cumbersome for users, why still make them deal with seed phrases at all? Why not offer a Magic Eden-custodied wallet with a one-click email solution instead?\n\nLu said that holding your own crypto and NFTs is crucial to \u201cthe ethos of Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIntroducing Magic Eden Wallet, a wallet made for Magic Eden users and cross-chain collectors.

For instance, when users have multiple wallets installed\u2014like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, or the Ronin Wallet, for example\u2014they can occasionally \u201cfight\u201d each other to connect to a website, simultaneously popping up at once and creating connection issues and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe're actually working pretty deeply right now to make sure that the wallets don't fight each other as much,\u201d Lu said, citing Magic Eden\u2019s work on its wallet with crypto tech firm Exodus.\n\nIn addition to cross-chain swaps, the Magic Eden wallet will also offer users the ability to buy crypto with fiat currency from within the wallet through a MoonPay integration, Lu said. The wallet will include NFT-focused features like cross-chain portfolio tracking, Bitcoin Ordinals support, and simultaneous connection to multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cI think self-custody and email login\u2014and those seamless implementations\u2014they're not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lu told Decrypt of the wallet\u2019s potential future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very exciting technologies that we're looking to tap into to make that onboarding experience much more smooth, much more familiar to the mainstream user.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "At a recent event in Turkey, Ethereum\u2019s cofounder Vitalik Buterin announced his plan to improve Ethereum staking and address performance issues in the network. If implemented, these changes could have a significant impact on users and developers, he added in his speech at Devconnect in Turkey.\n\nButerin said that his vision for Ethereum includes the integration of private mempools and ERC-4337. Private mempools would protect users\u2019 privacy and security by allowing them to conduct transactions without revealing their intentions to the public mempool, where miners could potentially exploit them.\n\nERC-4337 refers to account abstraction, which would give users more control over their accounts and make features like multisig wallets easier to use and more secure.\n\nAnother feature Buterin is considering is code precompilation, which could speed up and reduce the cost of smart contract deployment by preprocessing certain elements of the code. Code precompilation has the potential to make the Ethereum network more efficient and scalable. It can also reduce the number of mistakes made by developers and improve the reliability of smart contracts.\n\nButerin has also proposed improvements to liquid staking, a process that allows users to earn rewards while keeping their assets liquid. However, he has expressed concerns about centralization in current solutions, such as Lido Finance.\n\nTo solve this, Buterin suggests improving the decentralization of liquid staking, giving more users access to the rewards of staking without sacrificing liquidity.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed redesign could have a significant impact on the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially leading to greater scalability, security, and efficiency.\n\nThis could lead to lower transaction fees, faster transaction speeds, and more reliable network performance, making it easier and cheaper for users and developers to participate in the ecosystem.\n\nThe improved usability and lower barriers to entry could attract new users and developers, boosting adoption and potentially driving up the price of Ethereum and other assets within the ecosystem.\n\nRead also: SBI Holdings partners with Circle for USDC circulation and web3 services"

        "title": "Despite Massive Gains, Solana (SOL) Could Just be Getting Started - TipRanks",
        "content": "Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have bounced back in a big way in 2023, with year-to-date gains of 123% and 69%, respectively. Beyond the two largest cryptos, other assets like Solana (SOL-USD) have done even better. Solana is up 387% so far in 2023, but the party could just be getting started.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Solana\u2019s long-term potential based on its impressive performance metrics, the explosive growth of usage and activity on the Solana blockchain, and its relatively low market cap versus its peer, Ethereum.\n\nStellar Metrics\n\nSolana is a proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum. To be fully transparent, I own both Solana and Ethereum, and I am bullish on both, so the following comparison between the two networks is simply meant to illustrate the potential value of Solana.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but Solana features several notable advantages from a user perspective. While Ethereum is averaging a throughput of under 30 transactions per second (TPS), Solana features an exponentially higher throughput of 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThis high throughput leads to faster transaction times. Transactions on Solana are often completed in a matter of seconds, whereas transactions on Ethereum can take five minutes or more to process at times (the average is between 15 seconds to five minutes).\n\nMeanwhile, high transaction costs, or \u201cgas fees,\u201d have been one of the main gripes Ethereum users have had about the network for a long time. At writing, Ethereum\u2019s gas fees have hit their highest levels in six months and are averaging over $30 per transaction, making it cumbersome and expensive to use the network for routine transactions.\n\nIn contrast, transactions on Solana cost less than a penny. This makes Solana an appealing option for users who want to make low-cost transactions. If you want to buy a nonfungible token (NFT) for $40 or send a friend $20, paying $30 in gas on Ethereum isn\u2019t practical, whereas a transaction fee of under a penny on Solana is hardly noticeable. These low costs could help Solana appeal to more users as cryptocurrency reaches wider adoption.\n\nThis massive throughput, low cost, and fast transaction time led Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts to declare that Solana could be \u201cthe Visa (NYSE:V) of the digital asset ecosystem\u201d earlier this year.\n\nWhile the Solana blockchain\u2019s performance is impressive, it could get even better. Solana users are awaiting the launch of Firedancer, a new validator in development that will reportedly increase Solana\u2019s throughput to a mind-blowing one million transactions per second.\n\nUsage Explodes\n\nThis positive user experience has led to an explosion in usage for Solana. Crypto publication The Defiant recently reported that \u201cSolana is having its best month ever\u201d in terms of trading volume and total value locked.\n\nVolume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana hit an all-time high of $5.1 billion in November, smashing the previous record of $2.8 billion last November.\n\nSolana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) \u2014 essentially a measure of how much value users have committed to or locked up in the network \u2014 has jumped from $427 million at the start of November to $610 million currently, indicating growing confidence in the Solana network by crypto users.\n\nOn November 11th, the number of daily active users (DAUs) on Solana even surpassed those of the much larger Ethereum, with 356,300 users for the day versus 330,000 for Ethereum.\n\nIncreasing Collaborations and Partnerships\n\nAdditionally, Solana has made significant headway in terms of corporate partnerships and tie-ups with other crypto projects.\n\nIn August, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) announced an integration with Solana Pay, which would make using Solana a new payment option on the platform. Then, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, in September, Visa announced that it would use Solana to facilitate USDC (USDC-USD) stablecoin transactions.\n\nFurthermore, some interesting crypto projects, like Helium and Render (RNDR-USD), are migrating to Solana. Render, which seeks to provide decentralized GPU computing power for 3D content creation, migrated from Ethereum to Solana earlier in November. Render founder Jules Urbach said that Render made the move because of Solana\u2019s \u201cincredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Helium, which is focused on providing decentralized WiFi, made the move from its own layer-1 blockchain to Solana to free up its developers from having to focus on maintaining their own blockchain and leverage Solana\u2019s fast transaction times.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSolana\u2019s enormous throughput, fast transaction times, and minuscule transaction fees have attracted more users to the network. As a result, activity on the Solana blockchain is experiencing a Cambrian explosion, as seen in the significant increase in DEX volume, total value locked, and daily active users.\n\nNone of this is to say that Solana will displace or disrupt Ethereum (and again, I am bullish on both). It should be noted that Ethereum is working on upgrades that could improve its throughput and lower gas fees. Still, these impressive stats are even more notable when considering that Solana has a market cap of just $23 billion versus Ethereum\u2019s considerably higher market cap of $239 billion.\n\nWith performance metrics that are ahead of Ethereum\u2019s and user numbers that are rapidly growing, Solana looks like it offers considerable value with a market cap that is just one-tenth the size of Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a high-risk investment and can be extremely volatile. But for risk-tolerant investors who are interested in cryptocurrency and investing in the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it could make sense to add exposure to Solana while it has just one-tenth of Ethereum\u2019s market value.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "In the ever-shifting tides of the crypto market, recent events have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. The meme coin BONK on the Solana network has surged a significant 25%, buoyed by news from Binance about its futures listing. Amidst this flurry of activity, Ethereum whales are turning their gaze to a new ICO in the AI crypto world, InQubeta (QUBE), highlighting a growing interest in top crypto coins with innovative use cases.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Pioneering the AI-Crypto Fusion\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, InQubeta is making a name for itself with its unique blend of AI and crypto. This innovative platform is drawing the attention of Ethereum whales and investors seeking new avenues in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nInQubeta stands out with its approach to democratizing the AI startup investment landscape. By leveraging the QUBE token, the platform enables fractional investment in AI startups through trending NFTs, making what was once a niche investment option accessible to a broader audience. Once you purchase a fraction of these NFTs, you are entitled to share profits made by the company of your choice and also get access to special products.\n\nQUBE is the deflationary ERC20 coin powering the entire ecosystem, and it comes equipped with rewarding tokenomics. A unique taxation mechanism ensures that a portion of every transaction is sent to a burn wallet, while some of it is also reserved for a dedicated reward pool. QUBE also follows a governance model, where each holder can make their voice heard according to the size of their portfolio.\n\nOne key reason behind Ethereum whales showing confidence in this project is the successful completion of an audit by a reputed blockchain security firm. The appeal is further enhanced by the astounding success in the presale, with over $5.4 million already raised. QUBE is currently one of the best new cryptos to invest in, given the bright future roadmap of InQubeta.\n\nSolana\u2019s Meme Coin BONK Witnesses a Major Spike\n\nMeanwhile, the Solana network\u2019s meme coin BONK has been making headlines with its impressive 25% price jump. This surge coincided with Binance\u2019s announcement of a futures offering for BONK, along with PYTH, a DeFi network oracle. BONK\u2019s spike in popularity appears to be benefiting from the increased attention on Solana, which itself has seen a 90% increase in price over the last month.\n\nThis development in BONK\u2019s value and the renewed investor interest in Solana underscore the dynamic and sometimes whimsical nature of meme coins in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto market is currently buzzing with the significant growth of Solana\u2019s meme coin BONK and the rising interest from Ethereum whales in the AI-driven InQubeta. Memecoins are still a thing in the market, but it\u2019s top ICOs like InQubeta that add a different taste to the industry. It bridges the gap between crypto and AI, thus connecting two different worlds in the most decentralized way.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nBlockzeit Disclaimer: This article is sponsored.

        "title": "Step Aside Bitcoin and Ether, GameStop Memes Is the Crypto You Can't Afford To Miss - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Learn about the tempting financial potential that GameStop Memes offers in the middle of the rising Bitcoin and Ether Option activity.\n\nOpportunities emerge from the most unlikely tales in the world of cryptocurrencies. The growth of GameStop Memes (GSM), a coin inspired by the legendary Wall Street Memes narrative, is one such story that has enthralled the crypto market. As the notional open interest of active Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts on Deribit reaches a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, now is the time to look into why GameStop Memes is a great investment opportunity in today's crypto scene.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Drive The Scene\n\nBefore we get into GameStop Memes, it's important to understand the context in which this crypto gem is set. The notionally open interest in Bitcoin and Ether options contracts has skyrocketed, according to Deribit, a large cryptocurrency exchange. As reported by Swiss-based Laevitas, this sum has already reached a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, virtually matching the peak set in November 2021, when Bitcoin was selling at an eye-popping $66,000.\n\nIt's worth noting that the current open interest in these contracts substantially outnumbers that of November 2021. With nearly twice the number of outstanding contracts, it's not just a triumph for Deribit, but also a strong indication of the cryptocurrency market's expansion and increased interest in options.\n\nWhere It All Began\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the show's main attraction - GameStop Memes. It all started in early 2021, when retail traders banded together to support GameStop, defying Wall Street's hegemony. This game-changing campaign demonstrated to the globe that the masses could, in fact, take on the financial system. GameStop Memes sprang from this maelstrom of events.\n\nGameStop Memes is here to carry on the tradition, representing the original GameStop movement's spirit of rebellion, solidarity, and humour. This token is about more than simply investing; it's about making a commitment to the future, about democratising finance and offering tools for financial empowerment and education.\n\nThe unique strategy of GameStop Memes distinguishes it in the enormous ocean of cryptocurrencies. It combines memes with finance to make investing more approachable and pleasurable. So, what makes GameStop Memes such an appealing investment potential in today's crypto environment? Let's look more closely:\n\nA Tribute To GameStop\n\nGameStop Memes celebrates the legendary GameStop movement. It is a sign of opposition to traditional structures that frequently exclude individuals. This homage keeps the communal spirit alive and well.\n\nCommunity-Driven Approach\n\nUnlike many cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes places the community at the centre of its operations. It seeks to unite people all around the world with a common objective to democratise finances and provide resources for financial empowerment and education.\n\nSecure And Transparent\n\nIn the crypto realm, transparency and security are crucial. GameStop Memes achieves both by providing a safe environment for its users while retaining operational openness. This degree of confidence is priceless in the crypto world.\n\nInnovative Tokenomics\n\nGameStop Memes aren't only about making money in the near run. Its revolutionary tokenomics are intended to assure long-term involvement and stability. This emphasis on sustainability distinguishes it from many other speculative coins on the market.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nGameStop Memes offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of something bigger, something that celebrates the strength of the community and the lighter side of finance. While notional open interest in Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on Deribit continues to rise, GameStop Memes serves as a timely reminder that the unexpected may frequently produce the most substantial returns in the crypto realm. Don't miss out on this revolutionary adventure, invest in GameStop Memes and become a part of the movement that is redefining financial rules.\n\nGameStop Memes\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Bitcoin emerged as the leader, capturing a significant 49.11% of the market share, followed by Ethereum with 16.50%.\n\nThe top 20 cryptocurrencies make up 85.93% percent of the total market, according to a recent report done by Invezz.com, an investment platform. Bitcoin emerged as the leader, capturing a significant 49.11% of the market share, followed by Ethereum with 16.50%.\n\nIn a recent analysis, researchers examined the market caps of 2,174 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, revealing that the top 20 tokens command a substantial 85.93% of the total market. It\u2019s worth noting that cryptocurrencies with self-reported market caps were intentionally excluded from the study.\n\nIn the crypto scene, market cap is a way to gauge a cryptocurrency\u2019s popularity and potential for growth. Calculated by multiplying the total coins in circulation by the price per coin, this figure helps assess whether a cryptocurrency is a solid choice compared to others in terms of safety and potential returns.\n\nThe analysis also unveils that the top 120 cryptocurrencies account for a staggering 93.07% of the total market.\n\nThese are the top 20 cryptocurrencies ranked by their total value in circulation, known as market capitalization. It\u2019s not a suggestion on what to buy or avoid; rather, it\u2019s a list of the most significant projects by market capitalization. It gives you an overview of the landscape before making decisions about investing in crypto:\n\nSpeaking on the result of the analysis, Invezz Market analyst, Crispus Nyaga commented that: \u201cMarket cap remains a crucial gauge of a cryptocurrency\u2019s relevance, despite being criticized for reflecting long-term popularity rather than immediate value. Large-cap cryptocurrencies, with market caps exceeding $10 billion, are generally viewed as safer investments due to their stability compared to smaller assets. Mid-cap cryptos, while more volatile, offer greater growth potential, while small-cap cryptocurrencies are highly risky but may present short-term growth opportunities with the caveat of sudden crashes.\u201d\n\nInvezz is an online financial news platform offers financial information and peer review market analysis related to equities, forex, commodities, real estate and crowdfunding, enabling investors to stay updated about the recent trends in equity, trading and derivative markets.\n\n"

        "content": "Not long after sharing the details regarding the decentralization of the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of its blockchain development firm Input Output Global (IOG), has criticized Ethereum (ETH) plans for staking structure redesign shared by the platform\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs it happens, Hoskinson took a jab at Ethereum as he commented on a video of Buterin admitting to the overly centralized nature of current staking on the platform and describing plans to redesign its staking operations in an X post shared by user Stake with Pride on November 24.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nFurthermore, responding to the comment noting that he was \u201cfuelling hostility\u201d with Ethereum, Hoskinson refuted such observations, arguing that Vitalik was \u201crediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation,\u201d adding that it was \u201cextraordinary that we never get a shout-out.\u201d\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum decentralization\n\nAs a reminder, the Cardano founder had poked fun at Buterin and his ideas before as well, like in early October, when the Ethereum pioneer shared a post listing the advantages of suggested changes in staking design for users who do not have enough resources to stake on their own.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson recently revealed Cardano\u2019s upcoming moves toward the \u201cfull-blown\u201d decentralized governance structure as it enters the Voltaire era in its roadmap, including through the movements of all repositories to a community-run project called Intersect, as Finbold reported on November 17.\n\nElsewhere, Cardano\u2019s ADA token was at press time trading at the price of $0.381, which shows a decline of 2.50% on the day and a loss of 2.83% across the previous week while it still holds onto the gain of 30.08% on its monthly chart, according to the data on November 27.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "JAKARTA - Vitalik Buterin, a key figure in the crypto world, responded to Andresson Horowitz's views regarding his future role in technology and its impact on humans. The Ethereum founder outlined his ideas in Vitalik.eth.limo's personal blog post on November 27, 2023.\n\nPreviously, Horowitz wrote his idea entitled The Techno-Optimist Manifesto\" in a blog post stressing the importance of embracing technology and markets for a brighter future. This Manifesto rejects the idea of stagnation and highlights the need to prioritize progress rather than maintaining the status quo.\n\nVitalik Buterin expressed his views on the impact of technology on the quality of life, health, comfort, and access to information in the last century. However, he highlighted certain risks caused by technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) that have the potential to threaten human existence.\n\nLaunching Beincrypto, Buterin proposed an alternative perspective called \"defensive acceleration\" or \"d/acc\". This concept involves accelerating certain technologies which are expected to make the world safer. It also emphasizes the need to limit or slow down the development of technology that tends to consolidate power or pose an uncontrolled risk.\n\nSome examples of \"defense-favoring\" technologies suggested by Buterin to accelerate include resilient infrastructure and pandemic-response technologies. Also include encryption and blockchain to maintain privacy and decentralization, as well as tools to enable democratic governance.\n\nButerin warned about the increasing digital authoritarianism that could be exploited against opposition or those who oppose the government. This is claimed to be controlled by a large number of technology companies.\n\nHuman And AI Collaboration\n\nNot only that, the Ethereum boss added that most people prefer to postpone the development of highly sophisticated artificial intelligence for a decade rather than being monopolized by one group or technology giant company.\n\nEspecially for advanced artificial intelligence, Buterin suggests focusing more on collaboration between AI and humans than autonomous systems. The cognitive increase in autonomous systems will also be prioritized to address the risk of takeover by superintelection.\n\nFor Buterin, humans are 'bright stars' who are able to produce good things and reap the positive values of the progress of human civilization itself. Then, he also emphasized the importance of using technology, and responding wisely to the rapid development of technology.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "content": "Best Ethereum App in Australia 2024\n\nThe best Ethereum app should allow you to buy and trade Ethereum, exchange the crypto for other cryptocurrencies, and perform a range of trading strategies short positions, range trading, and scalping.

Most exchanges or online brokers play the middleman \u2013 helping millions of individuals purchase Ethereum and facilitate simple and complex trading strategies.\n\nCrypto.com\n\nCrypto.com is one of the most powerful trading platforms in the industry. With over 50 million users, a powerful and seamless trading environment, AI-powered trading features, and competitive fees, Crypto.com has sealed its brand as the best go-to trading app for beginners, pro-investors, and traders.\n\nKey Features\n\nInsurance:\n\nIn September 2021, Crypto.com announced an expansion to its already-impressive insurance program.

It also holds licenses in other major regions like the United States, the UK, most parts of Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world.

Cons: Trading fees fluctuate and can be confusing. Crypto.com has a long list of fees on the Fee Page, which can be excruciating to read, especially for beginner investors. If it\u2019s any consolation, their fees are very competitive and one of the best in the market.\n\nYour money is at risk\n\nBest Apps For Storing Ethereum\n\nThe best Ethereum apps for storing coins are wallets dedicated to storing ETH and other cryptocurrencies. These apps are not necessarily trading apps but are used by people who buy and keep cryptocurrencies rather than trade frequently. Let\u2019s explore the MetaMask wallet.\n\nMetaMask\n\nMetamask is one of the world\u2019s most popular Ethereum apps with over 30 million global users. Since its inception, MetaMask has continued to break boundaries and set itself as the best Ethereum wallet mobile app and the go-to portal between users and Web3 or blockchain applications. Let\u2019s explore why MetaMask is special.\n\nKey Features\n\nMetaMask is incredibly simple to use:\n\nMetaMask allows users to buy, sell, and swap tokens over its mobile application or browser extension. The wallet gives you a secure vault, token exchange capabilities, a token wallet, and safe login. It\u2019s an all-in-one app that promotes Web 3 usage in a simple interface. The beginner-friendly interface helps you store and manage your tokens.\n\nInteract with blockchain applications:\n\nMetaMask is ever so important because most Web 3 applications sit on the Ethereum blockchain and its variants. MetaMask bridges metaverse explorers with blockchains by providing a seamless portal to buy and exchange Ethereum \u2013 Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token.\n\nMetaMask allows you securely access blockchain apps without giving up more than necessary data. The mobile app also supports NFT and DeFi applications such as opensea, giving you unlimited access to the DeFi world.\n\nMetaMask swap:\n\nMetaMask\u2019s new Swap feature allows you to swap tokens at the most competitive prices. For example, MetaMask accesses liquidity information of DEX\u2019s liquidity pools and DEX aggregators like UniSwap, AirSwap, Curve, 0XAPI, 1inch, and Paraswap. With such data, you can execute positions with DEXs with the largest liquidity and save money from spreads.\n\nThe gas fee on a swap is $0.0875% of the swap volume. For large swap volumes, MetaMask spreads your order over multiple DEXs to avoid slippage. Slippage occurs when you make large orders from a single exchange, and prices swing because the exchange isn\u2019t liquid enough to immediately execute the order. Large swaps or positions often lead to slippage, but MetaMask saves you from slippage costs by spreading your order over multiple DEXs.\n\nSecurity:\n\nMetaMask has intensive security protocols, multi-layer security systems, and 2FA authentication to ensure consumer funds\u2019 safety. MetaMask also has an open policy. That is, they disclose security breaches to the users immediately one is suspected. The transparency makes them the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\nMetaMask native ecosystem supports ETH and ETH-based tokens like the ERC-20 and ERC-721.\n\nPros: MetaMask is one of the most popular ETH wallets available.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.\n\nA swap fee of 0.875% is highly competitive, given that MetaMask exposes users to top DEXs with deep liquidity and minimizes spreads.

With MetaMask, you can execute large swaps without worrying about painful gas fees. Cons: While spreading your large order over different liquidity providers and DEXs, you may incur unwarranted fees each DEX charges on order execution. Spreads are not fixed and are entirely dependent on the market and the liquidity of the commodity.\n\nMetaMask supports Ethereum and its variants in its native ecosystem, while swaps are executed via a partnership with other companies. It begets the question of trust. Can you trust MetaMask to keep your data safe and not share unnecessary data with its partners? We think you can!\n\nYour money is at risk\n\nAre Crypto Apps Safe To Use?\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has been the target of malicious groups. While they operate on autonomous and decentralized systems powered by blockchain networks, attackers often find loopholes in smart contracts and bridges, seizing unimaginable amounts of money from users\u2019 wallets. It\u2019s important to consider the security of your crypto apps before choosing an app to use. Ethereum and Bitcoin trading are the two most prominent coins, and we also have tons of tokens in the market. Investing or trading these coins comes with risk. Let\u2019s explore the safety of crypto apps:\n\nBefore you choose a crypto app, ensure that the app has grade-A level security protocols and does not have a long history of breaches: Apps like Crypto.com and MetaMask, are considered extremely safe because of the safety and security measures they explore in keeping user assets.\n\nCold wallets:\n\nWhile it is easier to transfer funds in hot wallets, cold wallets offer the best security. A crypto wallet or app should store its assets in a cold wallet \u2013 inaccessible online to hackers. When your assets are securely stored in a vault, it means that hackers cannot access your wallet through the portal.\n\nLicenses:\n\nA licensed crypto app beats an unlicensed one. No matter how promising an app is, you are subject to malpractices like pump and dumps, rug pull, and hacks if it is unlicensed. Also, when a crypto app is unlicensed, users are not under any user-protection contract; hence, funds lost are dead and gone.\n\nUser reviews:\n\nBefore choosing an app, check out their reviews on PlayStore. It\u2019s usually rare to see a crypto app with a 5-star review aggregate, but anywhere from 3.9 to 4.5 stars is good enough. Of course, the latter number is preferred.\n\nAustralian regulation\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, is the highest regulatory body for financial providers and financial asset collectors. It\u2019s important to use an app that is licensed by the ASIC. First, the ASIC puts financial institutions through an extreme vetting process, ensuring they have excellent security protocols and insurance policies protecting users. When you visit an exchange\u2019s \u2018Security\u2019 page, you see many industry lingoes. Some of these words and numbers are entirely impossible to decipher. An exchange can boast of a certain security feature, but it takes an expert to know real stuff from the shaft. An ASIC certification proves that an exchange or app is as secure as they claim they are.\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSecurity and privacy are two very important factors to consider before choosing an app. Let\u2019s take a look at the security features and privacy factors you must consider:\n\n2FA: A crypto app should always support two-factor authentication. The more complex the layers of authentication, the better. Some apps won\u2019t allow you to log into your account without authenticating your primary device. Other apps send codes to your email address and phone number. If an activity on your account raises suspicion, an app should be able to lock you out and request your private key before logging you back in. Other 2FA protocols include location \u2013 if you log in from an unusual location, a crypto app can log you out and request your private key before letting you gain access. Volume: If your withdrawal volume is disproportionate to your usual volume, an app\u2019s AI can spot this as a scam and request that you provide your private keys. Cold storage: Cold storage removes your wallet from online. When your wallet and assets are on the blockchain, it is online and susceptible to attacks from malicious scammers. When your assets are offline, it is impossible for an attacker to steal them through online measures. Data sharing: Apps like MetaMaks partner with multiple exchanges to find the best liquidity when you want to swap cryptocurrencies. While the process ensures that you get the most competitive prices at any given time, it may mean that MetaMask and the other DEXs have to share information. MetaMask has explicitly stated in its website that it values user privacy and doesn\u2019t share more-than-needed data; you may need to check the data privacy of other crypto apps to ensure that they do not share sensitive data with their partners.\n\nHow to spot a crypto app scam\n\nCrypto app scams have become a mainstay in the cryptocurrency industry. Scammers often employ different techniques to draw unsuspecting victims and siphon their funds. Let\u2019s take a look at activities that scream scam in the crypto industry.\n\nA shabby-looking website: Scam websites often have the same layout because most scammers are impatient and use scripts of other scam websites to lure people into registering their accounts. A scam website will lack a good home page, won\u2019t reveal the name of the founders of the project, and will have a poor layout. Websites like MetaMask, Binance, and Coinbase, are professionally built and have a simple layout. Leave the website immediately if the layout doesn\u2019t appeal to your sense of safety. Promise mouth-watering returns: Scam websites often promise their users mouth-watering returns like 33% to 44% APY on staking and investments. Cryptocurrency investment can have great returns, but the market is volatile, and no exchange or broker can boast of constant positive returns on investment. A website that promises to double your investment in a few days is certainly a scam. Even established brokers like Crypto.com promise an 8% APY after about a year of holding. Does not require identity verification: Scammers want you to quickly get to the payment page, so they skip many important elements a crypto website should have. One of those elements is identity verification and proof of address. It is illegal to allow an entity to trade without verifying the entity\u2019s identity. Any exchange or app that allows you to trade unverified is certainly not licensed by any major agency. You will be better off donating your funds to charity. No licenses: A crypto website that allows users worldwide to trade without proper licenses in trading regions is a scam site. Be careful! Scam sites are usually open to everyone in every country. Some of them are small time, so they do not fall under the radar of law enforcement; however, these websites can steal thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars from unsuspecting victims. Spam calls and messages: Any website that claims that an expert will call you during the registration process is most likely a scam. First, a real website with good traffic won\u2019t invest that much in telemarketing. The cryptocurrency space is volatile, and authentic sites avoid telemarketing at all costs. If a crypto exchange calls or sends messages advising you to invest more, you may be in a scam ecosystem.\n\nOther tips to consider include the following:\n\nNever open a link or button in an email from unverified sources. Opening unverified or malicious links can make your device vulnerable to security attacks, including cryptojacking (your device will be used to mine cryptocurrencies). Ensure that you visit the correct URL of popular crypto apps. For example, metamask.io can be cunningly delivered as metamasks.io. The former is the correct MetaMask website URL. The latter, if it exists, is a phony website dressed like the actual MetaMask site.\n\nTop Tips for Using Ethereum Apps Safely Never share your passphrase Under no circumstance should you ever share your private key or passphrase. With your passphrase, scammers can lock you out of your wallet and withdraw every penny you have. Passphrase security tips include: Do not store your passphrase online. Instead, store it in a physical security box. Do not share your passphrase with friends or family members. Use a reliable internet connection A reliable and secure internet connection allows you to explore cryptocurrency applications without exposing yourself to vulnerabilities. Before logging into your crypto wallet, follow these security steps: Do not use public online access: When you browse on public wifi, scammers can mirror your online activity and gain access to valuable information like your wallet address and password. If you want to log into your MetaMask, ensure you do so on a public and secured network. Auto-filling your wallet address might be a bad idea. If a thief steals any of your devices (mobile or laptop), he can gain access to some of your wallets if he logs in through your device. This is because apps like Google and Dashlane lets you autofill passwords and email addresses. Instead of auto-filling, you can set password-saver apps to request for your fingerprint or facial recognition before providing the password. Read user reviews before signing up User reviews give you practical data on how a wallet or an exchange works. If an exchange has poor customer service or has frequent glitches, many users will use the review section of PlayStore or Apple Store to express their displeasure. If a wallet generally has negative reviews, you should find another decent one for your Ethereum storing and trading needs. Store your ETH in a cold wallet after purchasing When you purchase Ethereum, ensure you store it in a cold wallet like MetaMask. A cold wallet is offline and protects your assets better. Can You Use Ethereum Apps To Buy Other Cryptos? Yes, you can use Ethereum apps to buy other cryptocurrencies.
