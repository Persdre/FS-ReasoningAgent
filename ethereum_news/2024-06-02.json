        "title": "Can Ethereum Hit $100,000? An In-depth Analysis. - Investing Haven",
        "content": "There is no path for Ethereum to hit 100k before 2030, it\u2019s impossible.\n\nRELATED \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) prediction 2025.\n\nIn this article, we explore why ETH cannot rise to $100k in the coming 10 years. We apply a rational method to assess what would happen if ETH were to hit $100k. The outcome, clearly, is that a world in which ETH hits $100k is simply not realistic relative to world economies, market capitalization and valuation of leadings assets and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe answer to this existential question is certainly not to be found in traditional communication channels which are very short term oriented (case in point: $ETH). Similarly, an ETH peak price prediction search is not helpful neither.\n\nWe have to establish the answer ourselves by using common sense.\n\nCan Ethereum hit $100,000? Market cap implications.\n\nShould Ethereum reach the $100,000 mark, its market capitalization would soar to an astounding $13.7 trillion, based on the current circulating supply. This figure is not just monumental; it is transformative.\n\nFor perspective, this would dwarf the market cap of:\n\nMany of the world\u2019s most valuable companies combined;\n\nSurpass the GDP of several major economies.\n\nSuch a valuation would signify Ethereum\u2019s transition from a digital asset to a global economic powerhouse.\n\n\u2018What If\u2019 analysis: Can Ethereum hit $100,000\n\nThe possibility of Ethereum reaching a valuation of $100,000 per unit is a scenario that is often discussed on the web. We see all sorts of opinions and \u2018analysis\u2019, from decent to speculative.\n\nSuch a monumental rise, equating to approximately a 50-fold increase from Ethereum\u2019s current value, requires a deep dive into the implications. To understand the magnitude and feasibility of this scenario, we must analyze it through various lenses:\n\nMarket capitalization;\n\nComparison with Bitcoin;\n\nthe temporal aspect of such growth.\n\nWe take a very structured and analytical approach to answer the question whether ETH can rise to $100k in the coming 7 years.\n\n1. Market cap implications\n\nThe implications of a $13.7 trillion market cap are vast:\n\nFirst, it would reflect an unprecedented level of adoption and utilization of the Ethereum platform, far beyond what we see today. This could mean that Ethereum has become the backbone of a new digital economy, underpinning everything from finance to supply chains, and even governmental systems.\n\nand utilization of the Ethereum platform, far beyond what we see today. This could mean that Ethereum has become the backbone of a new digital economy, underpinning everything from finance to supply chains, and even governmental systems. The technical challenges of scalability, security, and sustainability would need to be fully addressed to support this level of adoption, necessitating groundbreaking advancements in blockchain technology.\n\nA $13.7 market cap which will be the result of a scenario in which Ethereum hits $100,000 seems really unrealistic.\n\n2. Comparison with Bitcoin\n\nIn this scenario, ETH to 100k, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap would be projected at $42 trillion, assuming it maintains its current dominance, also assuming no change in the current BTCETH ratio.\n\nThis would result in a BTC price of around $2 million dollar per unit. That\u2019s not going to happen in the next 7 years.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, a store of value, Ethereum\u2019s positioning as a platform for decentralized applications offers a different kind of value proposition.\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth to a $13.7 trillion market cap suggests a broader range of use cases and a deeper integration into the fabric of the digital economy.\n\n3. Temporal Considerations\n\nPredicting such a significant increase in Ethereum\u2019s value before 2030 presents a considerable challenge. The impact of technological innovations, regulatory developments, and global economic conditions over this period is highly uncertain because this scenario is so far out in the future.\n\nTake-aways\n\nThus, while not impossible, the data points suggest that Ethereum to $100k is an unlikely outcome in the mid to long-term.\n\nLooking beyond 2030, the forecast becomes even more speculative. The rapid pace of change in technology and society makes long-term predictions notoriously difficult. However, if we consider the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize multiple sectors, the ongoing evolution of Ethereum, and its ability to address current limitations, the prospect, while still ambitious, cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nETH to $100k chart implications\n\nLet\u2019s chart out the hypothetical scenario in which Ethereum hits $100k in the coming years.\n\nThis is the current daily ETH price chart, with our projected target area for 2024.\n\nSeptember 13th, 2024 \u2013 While we remain bullish cryptocurrencies, including ETH, long term, the current chart setup shows why crypto investors need to remain realistic about expectations on valuations. A 4x rise in ETH will bring ETH to $10k, a realistic target in the coming years. But considering the pace at which this ETH chart is evolving, it simply is not realistic to expect $100k ETH as this would mark a 25x rise from current levels.\n\nSeptember 13th, 2024 \u2013 Our most recent Ethereum prediction suggests that ETH will need to drop once more in 2024 in order to create a bullish reversal that will resolve higher in 2025. We remain confident that our most bullish ETH target of $10,000 will be hit in the coming 3 years provided key support levels outlined in our predictive research will be respected.\n\nNow, we use the same rising trendline, as seen on the above daily chart. We turn it into a channel. We adjust scale to see where Ethereum\u2019s $100k mark comes in.\n\nThe same chart, but now without annotations:\n\nYou don\u2019t need a PhD, you can see it with your own eyes: ETH to hit $100k is very unlikely to be hit in the coming years, say before 2030.\n\nConclusion: can Ethereum hit $100,000?\n\nThe scenario of Ethereum reaching a $100,000 valuation and achieving a market cap of $13.7 trillion is a fascinating \u201cWhat If\u201d analysis. It stretches the boundaries of current thinking around cryptocurrency and blockchain technology\u2019s potential.\n\nThis hypothetical scenario underscores the transformative impact Ethereum could have on the global economy, should it overcome existing challenges and fulfill the promise of widespread adoption and utility.\n\nCrypto markets aren\u2019t ready for such a stretched valuation. Ethereum\u2019s chart doesn\u2019t support moving to $100k in the coming years.\n\nWhile ETH to $100,000 might happen at a certain point in time, it won\u2019t happen before 2030, is what we confidently can say. Here is a path to $10,000 though.\n\nETH fundamentals supportive of a $100k scenario?\n\nThe analysis discussed before was essentially a \u2018What If\u2019 analysis.\n\nWhile we had clear conclusions from the \u2018What If ETH hits $100k\u2019 analysis, we still want to understand a scenario in which Ethereum rises 50x from current levels.\n\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The recent transition to Ethereum 2.0, moving from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), aims to improve scalability, security, and sustainability \u2013 key factors that could boost Ethereum\u2019s adoption and value.\n\nTechnical Advancements and Scalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s ability to scale and meet the growing demand for its platform is critical. The success of Ethereum 2.0, including the implementation of layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, could significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction throughput. These advancements are essential for Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability and its potential to increase in value.\n\nFrom a technological perspective, it looks like Ethereum is not ready to reach a $13.7 trillion market cap, not yet.\n\nRegulatory Environment\n\nRegulation poses a significant risk to all cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Positive regulatory frameworks could pave the way for institutional investment and wider adoption, while stringent regulations could limit growth or even pose existential threats.\n\nIn the medium to long term, however, the lack of regulatory clarity, certainly as it relates to exchanges and trading/investing cryptocurrencies, will hold a massive inflow of capital back. This is subject to change over time, but much more time will be needed to justify Ethereum to rise to a $13.7 trillion market cap token.\n\nEconomic and Market Dynamics\n\nCryptocurrency markets are very volatile, influenced by factors like investor sentiment, market liquidity, and macroeconomic trends. Ethereum reaching $100,000 would not only require technological success and widespread adoption but also favorable economic conditions and market dynamics.\n\nWith so much uncertainty post-Covid, driven by inflationary fear and tight monetary policies, it is unlikely that economic conditions will ignite a tremendous bullish momentum wave in markets and crypto to justify a 50x rise in ETH.\n\nPotential Pathways for ETH to hit $100,000\n\nFor Ethereum to reach a valuation of $100,000, several factors would likely need to converge:\n\nMassive institutional adoption: Large-scale investment from institutional investors could drive significant demand.\n\nLarge-scale investment from institutional investors could drive significant demand. Mainstream use cases: Ethereum becoming the backbone for major applications in finance, supply chain, and beyond.\n\nEthereum becoming the backbone for major applications in finance, supply chain, and beyond. Technological success: Successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0, leading to widespread adoption due to improved scalability and efficiency.\n\nSuccessful implementation of Ethereum 2.0, leading to widespread adoption due to improved scalability and efficiency. Favorable regulatory environment: Supportive regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while providing clear guidelines.\n\nConclusion: ETH to $100k\n\nWhile the potential for Ethereum to reach $100,000 exists, it is likely many years out, at least 7 years (if not more).\n\nWith a $13.7 trillion market cap of Ethereum, if and when it hits $100k, massive changes need to occur, first and foremost fundamental, technological, regulatory. Moreover, institutions will need to be buying massive amounts of Ethereum.\n\nWe prefer to stick to our ETH to $10k target, that\u2019s already a big one. It will happen in the coming 3 years. Let\u2019s enjoy the ride, and not be too concerned about wild targets like ETH to $100k.\n\nOur premium crypto research service, the first premium crypto charting service in the world, covers tokens that can move much higher in the years to come."

        "title": "What are the factors that can push Ethereum\u2019s price upwards? - The Gila Herald",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has grown significantly since January 2022, reaching high values. But what led to this change? Some say that the increase in Ethereum\u2019s value has appeared thanks to speculations about a potential spot Ethereum ETF, an idea that emerged after the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAdditionally, people are optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future due to the successful implementation of the Capella Hard Fork and Shanghai upgrade, which increased its value quickly. Ethereum price prediction looks positive, as the second-largest cryptocurrency could finally reach the $4K mark. Here are some good factors that could drive its price upward.\n\nIncreasing interest from people\n\nOne of the main reasons behind the rise in Ethereum\u2019s price is the increasing interest of people both in the digital coin and in the innovations brought by the blockchain, including decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and NFTs. For example, DeFi applications allow people to borrow and lend digital coins, which have attracted a lot of interest lately, thus driving more demand for Ether. Plus, more major corporations have become interested in digital coins, which drives demand for the second-largest digital currency by market cap. Large companies, like JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft, have become interested in the Ethereum network, which has increased individuals\u2019 confidence in investing in Ethereum.\n\nA reduced supply in the crypto exchanges\n\nAnother thing that pushed Ether\u2019s price upward is the reduced supply on crypto exchanges. Individuals who buy digital currencies can keep their cryptocurrencies in exchange wallets or opt for a cold storage wallet. Now, the data shows that people have started withdrawing their digital currencies from crypto exchanges, meaning that investors don\u2019t intend to sell the digital coin soon, as they expect a price increase in the future. This happened in October 2023, when people withdrew the digital coins from the crypto exchanges, which accompanied a 130% raise in the price of Ether.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade, which occurred in March, can also increase the price of Ethereum, as with this upgrade, Ethereum improves its efficiency and scalability. The Dencun upgrade comprises two different upgrades, \u201cCancun\u201d and \u201cDeneb,\u201d and it will introduce the notion of proto-dank sharding, which reduces the cost of transactions because of layer two solutions. The upgrade has brought positive changes in the price of Ethereum, as the virtual coin has increased its value since the upgrade occurred.\n\nThe Spot ETF\n\nPeople have perceived the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF as a major milestone in the crypto industry, as this proves that BTC is an important asset, and more individuals will be able to invest in the largest digital coin without involving the complexities of the crypto technicalities. The spot Bitcoin ETF approval made people believe that an Ethereum ETF approval is next to come. Additionally, all the hype surrounding Bitcoin for the spot ETF event can be a catalyst that could push the prices of Ethereum upward.\n\nStaking\n\nEthereum functions on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, where validators must stake at least 32 ETH to make the blockchain function and validate new transactions. At first, Ethereum functioned on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) model, but it changed as this consensus mechanism raised concerns about the negative impact that this measure would bring to the environment because of the huge electric consumption that the mining process required. However, the transition to the PoS model made Ethereum more interesting to investors, thus increasing its price.\n\nIf 2023 and 2022 were years when Ethereum experienced a drop in staked assets, 2024 could be a better year, as it already looks positive, which could benefit investors from a long-term bullish outlook. Additionally, an increase in staking could reduce sell-side pressure on the crypto market. Usually, investors stake the tokens they don\u2019t intend to sell in the future, expecting the prices to grow.\n\nHow can Ethereum perform in the future?\n\nEthereum is not only a blockchain that powers Ether, the native coin of the network, but also a platform with a lot of capabilities, as it has many features, including dApps, NFTs, smart contracts, DeFi, and others.\n\nEven if, in the past, Ethereum prices seemed to drop, now it looks like the prices are going upwards, and ETH could reach $5,000 by the end of 2024. However, the future looks bright for 2025 as well, where ETH will have an average of $5,500, a maximum of $6,500, and a minimum of $4,500. In 2030, Ethereum might even experience a maximum of $20,500. In 2030, Ethereum could finally hit the $10,000 mark, where the price will go on an upward trend. This is why ETH might even be able to surpass its all-time high of $12,000 levels and prepare the crypto world for a new record.\n\nCan Ethereum outperform Bitcoin?\n\nAs the crypto space is very volatile, every scenario can happen, which is why people have even said that Ethereum might be able to outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum is a unique blockchain, and because of this, it will have a stable future and might perform better than the largest crypto king. Still, it is not very likely that Ethereum will surpass the price of Bitcoin, but it is more probable to reach a comparable market capitalization because ETH doesn\u2019t have a capped supply, unlike Bitcoin.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum is the second-largest digital currency by market cap, after Bitcoin, and because of all its innovations and capabilities, Ether is here to stay. As Ethereum goes through continuous growth with all the constant upgrades, people believe that both 2024 and the following years will be good for the cryptocurrency, as ETH will probably become more popular, increasing investors\u2019 confidence."

        "title": "$3B ETH Withdrawals from Exchanges Signal Potential Supply Squeeze for Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "$3B ETH Withdrawals from Exchanges Signal Potential Supply Squeeze for Ethereum\n\nFollowing the U.S. approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on May 23, over $3 billion worth of Ether has been withdrawn from centralized crypto exchanges, hinting at a possible future supply squeeze. CryptoQuant data reveals that between May 23 and June 2, approximately 797,000 Ether, valued at $3.02 billion, were moved off exchanges.\n\nThis significant reduction in exchange reserves suggests that investors are transferring their Ether to self-custody solutions, indicating a preference for holding over immediate selling. Fewer coins on exchanges typically imply reduced availability for sale, which can lead to tighter supply conditions. Supporting this trend, data from Glassnode, shows that the percentage of circulating Ether held on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level in years, now standing at just 10.6%.\n\nThe approval of Ether ETFs has sparked considerable interest, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggesting that these ETFs could realistically launch by late June. Some market analysts predict that the introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs could propel Ether to surpass its all-time high of $4,870, set in November 2021.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential impact of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which manages $11 billion in assets. If it follows the pattern of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $6.5 billion in outflows shortly after approval, it could significantly influence ETH\u2019s price dynamics."

        "content": "Will Ethereum break records in June?\n\nWe checked in with nine experts on their views on the market as ETF approval approaches.\n\nEthereum shot up over 30% to $3,800 in May after US approval of exchange-traded funds.\n\nMarket watchers now eye a new all-time high of plus $5,000 as early as June.\n\nAs the dust settles, the market is left wondering what\u2019s next for Ethereum.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts are saying.\n\nGalaxy\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\nA \u201cwidespread\u201d pivot in Washington caused the SEC to change its Ethereum ETF game, said Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.\n\nIf the SEC\u2019s change of heart was politically motivated, \u201cthat\u2019s a seismic shift,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what actually happened, prices are going to be much higher than here.\u201d\n\nSince he made the comments, however, President Joe Biden has followed through on his threat to veto a bipartisan-backed pro-crypto bill.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nFRNT Financial\u2019s Brickell\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum will reach all-time highs by the end of June, according to David Brickell, head of international distribution at FRNT Financial.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs approvals, a more positive outlook on the economy, and a smattering of crypto-friendly votes on Capitol Hill signal that the world\u2019s two leading cryptocurrencies will enjoy strong tailwinds over the next few weeks, he said.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t be surprised to see $80,000 and $5,000\u2033 for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, Brickell told DL News.\n\nCCData\u2019s Jacob Joseph\n\nNot only did Jacob Joseph, research analyst at cryptocurrency data firm CCData, expect Ethereum to hit a new record, but he also told DL News that investors will pour $3.9 billion into US spot Ethereum ETFs within the first 100 days of their launch.\n\nHe extrapolated the sum from the performance of the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 first 100 days.\n\nEven so, he cautioned that Ethereum might face challenges due to outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which could prove a drag on market sentiment.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has had over $17.7 billion in outflows since its January launch, according to BitMEX research.\n\nThe money has predominantly flowed to funds with lower fees.\n\nOKX\u2019s Lennix Lai\n\nLennix Lai, crypto exchange OKX\u2019s global chief commercial officer, told DL News that spot Ethereum ETF will trigger a new wave of institutional investor demand.\n\nHe said they\u2019ll likely pour $500 million into Ethereum ETFs during their first week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just as, if not more, important as the Bitcoin ETF approval,\u201d he said.\n\nTzTok-Chad\n\nThe growing sense of industry optimism has urged traders to pour some $3.4 billion into buying calls \u2014 or bullish bets \u2014 that Ethereum will exceed $4,000 by June 28.\n\nThe positioning in the derivatives indicates many traders are even targeting prices above $5,000, TzTok-Chad, the pseudonymous founder of decentralised options exchange Stryke, told DL News.\n\nYet, he warned that the path to the new record is not straightforward and to expect some volatility.\n\nConsensys\u2019 Joe Lubin\n\nExpect a \u201cfloodgate\u201d of demand for Ether, which will likely lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher, says Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of crypto infrastructure firm Consensys.\n\nInstitutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin ETFs \u201cwill most likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF,\u201d Lubin told DL News.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether\u201d via ETFs, he said.\n\nHe warned that there will be less supply to accommodate that demand than when the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January.\n\nBernstein\n\nDon\u2019t expect Ethereum ETF flows to hit those seen in Bitcoin funds.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, analysts at research firm Bernstein.\n\nIn a June 3 report, they said ETFs represent an opportunity to leverage \u201cpent-up demand from the same participants as the Bitcoin ETF, maybe with a lower allocation for ETH.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd given ETH\u2019s supply situation (staking, smart contracts, HODL data), ETH should see positive price action upon the ETF launch (expected next few days/sometime this month),\u201d Chhugani and Sapra said.\n\nKaiko\u2019s Adam McCarthy\n\nOptions traders who have \u201ccrowded around\u201d bullish options are now looking at gains, said Adam McCarthy, an analyst at Kaiko.\n\nEven so, he cautioned that \u201cHong Kong ETFs didn\u2019t see much demand and have had mixed days with several net outflow days already. No staking is a big factor too, and likely impacts demand further.\u201d\n\nHe suggested watching Grayscale\u2019s $9 billion ETHE product, \u201cif it suffers large outflows, that would be significant for prices.\u201d\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs May Have Ended the SEC\u2019s War on Crypto - Decrypt",
        "content": "About the Author Carlo D\u2019Angelo is a lawyer, former law professor, and crypto and NFT enthusiast. Carlo\u2019s practice focuses on advising clients in all areas of blockchain technology law. Carlo is also the host of Lex Line, a weekly crypto and blockchain law podcast. The views expressed here are his own and do not necessarily represent those of Decrypt.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMay\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the chef\u2019s kiss on what can only be described as a banner month for crypto policy\u2014and the move could severely undermine the SEC\u2019s ongoing crypto crackdown.\n\nAs the deadline to approve the Ethereum ETFs loomed, a bipartisan group of House of Representatives members sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler urging the Commission to not only approve the funds, but to also consider approval of \u201cother\u201d digital asset ETFs in the future. And finally, the SEC finally went public late on that fateful Thursday and announced approval of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nAccording to Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, the SEC\u2019s approval of spot ETFs effectively deems Ethereum (ETH) to be a commodity. If Grewal is correct in his assessment, then an ETH commodity would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as opposed to the SEC, which is tasked with regulating securities.\n\nThis is a key distinction for ETH, because the SEC\u2019s mandate is to police securities and protect investors. The CFTC instead regulates commodities such as raw materials and agricultural goods, with a focus on preventing market manipulation and fraud. The CFTC\u2019s regulatory framework over commodities is therefore generally less stringent compared to the SEC\u2019s treatment of securities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, this day, has been a rollercoaster unlike any other I\u2019ve seen. ETH is effectively deemed a Commodity as we\u2019ve always known it to be. I\u2019m proud to be on team @Coinbase, the trusted partner and custodian for many of the issuers who had 19b-4\u2019s approved tonight. pic.twitter.com/nz1HHFbBSQ \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) May 23, 2024\n\nAs digital assets continue to gain mass adoption, there remains an ongoing debate over which federal agency should have jurisdiction over the regulation and enforcement of this new and innovative technology.\n\nBack in 2021, former CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump gave a speech on the now-infamous XRP SEC enforcement action case, and noted that she was \u201cwatching the outcome of this case closely because it will help to establish the scope of the SEC\u2019s authority in the digital assets space.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Stump added:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe regulatory application to digital assets, much like the assets themselves, is evolving every day. It is exciting, yet also frustrating to those who seek more certainty. But the incredible transformation in this space requires adaptation and creative thinking, and let\u2019s be honest, neither are among a regulator\u2019s natural tendencies. \u2026 That is where the regulatory state of digital assets currently sits: We must enable innovators to think creatively such that the story can evolve, we must acknowledge there will be differences of opinion as to the utility and potential of various products, and we must expect some storms to arise. These are the considerations that should guide us as regulators in exercising the authorities to fulfill our mission such that the market can develop and meet its full potential.\n\nPerhaps the Ethereum ETF approval brings just the sort of regulatory clarity this sector has been looking for. If ETH and other similar cryptocurrencies are not securities, then the SEC lacks jurisdiction to regulate these assets under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThat means that the SEC can no longer argue that these tokens are investment contracts under the Howey Test. If ETH and similarly situated tokens are commodities, then crypto lawyers could argue in court that these cryptocurrencies are not investment contracts that come with an \u201cexpectation of profits from the efforts of others\u201d\u2014critical elements that the SEC must prove under the Howey Test.\n\nCrucially, by tacitly acknowledging that Ethereum is a commodity, the SEC may have just undercut its own legal arguments raised in several pending crypto enforcement court cases.\n\nIf courts are receptive to ETH and potentially other cryptocurrencies being commodities, then this could turn the tide on pending SEC lawsuits against major crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Kraken. These lawsuits hinge on the SEC\u2019s argument that selected tokens traded on these platforms are securities. But if Ethereum and similarly situated tokens are instead commodities, then this could green light a renewed motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuits against both Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nIf the federal judges in these cases agree with this argument, then this would essentially gut the SEC\u2019s claims that both Coinbase and Kraken offer trading of unregistered securities.\n\nSuch a ruling would deal a devastating blow to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is already under intense scrutiny from critics who believe his aggressive approach to regulation by enforcement actions is stifling the growth of the digital asset technology sector in the United States\u2014and pushing innovation overseas to more favorable jurisdictions.\n\nAs noted in Grewal\u2019s recent Twitter (aka X) post, now that the SEC has effectively said that \u201cETH sales can\u2019t be securities because Ethereum ETFs may be registered by funds with an S-1,\u201d the SEC has essentially agreed that ETH has no more of an \u201c\u2018ecosystem\u2019 any more than does Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s recent approval of Ethereum ETFs has profound potential implications for both pending and future legal battles in the digital asset sector. By suggesting that ETH, and other similarly situated tokens are commodities, the SEC may have dramatically limited its power to aggressively police the crypto sector.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Ethereum ETF decision may therefore further embolden players in the digital asset sector to push back against overzealous enforcement actions, resulting in fewer settlements and more court battles.\n\nGetting long-awaited clarity on whether ETH is a security or commodity may also curtail the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction over Ethereum and other similarly situated cryptocurrencies. This could in turn lead to a dramatic narrowing of the SEC\u2019s regulatory reach in the digital asset sector. Crypto lawyers will no doubt use the ETF decision to aggressively push back against pending SEC enforcement actions and lawsuits, and argue that the agency has overstepped its mandate.\n\nIf more digital assets are treated as commodities similar to what the Ethereum ETF decision suggests, then legislators may finally pass laws to vastly curtail the SEC\u2019s reach over these assets. As a result, these tokens could be subject to potentially less stringent regulation under the CFTC. Such a shift in agency oversight would create fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto startups, and foster a new wave of innovation in this sector.\n\nCrypto lawyers will likely leverage the ETF decision to reshape existing strategies with respect to how they advise clients in the digital asset space. These strategies may include advising crypto sector clients to place greater emphasis on the commodity nature of their tokens and platforms, in an effort to better insulate them from the SEC\u2019s reach.\n\nIf the Coinbase and Kraken legal defense teams are successful in dismissing pending SEC lawsuits based on the Ethereum ETF decision, then this could generate highly favorable legal precedents that would influence future regulation of the digital asset sector\u2014and usher in a fresh wave of blockchain innovation in the U.S.\n\nA new era of clarity with respect to digital asset laws would also benefit investigators and lawyers employed within both the SEC and the CFTC, by creating a potentially more predictable and stable regulatory environment. This would result in a more efficient use of agency resources, as opposed to the legally ambiguous environment we currently operate under. Regulatory clarity would also bring much-needed consistency for the judges who preside over digital asset cases, and generate more consistent and predictable outcomes.\n\nIt\u2019s my firm belief that crypto lawyers are the guardians of the blockchain, and play a vital role in the continued growth and adoption of crypto technology in the United States. The recent Ethereum ETF decision will only further empower crypto lawyers to better advise and navigate clients in the digital asset sector\u2014and I\u2019m excited to see how they creatively use this opportunity to do just that.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Institutional Interests and Investor Confidence\n\nWhy is the Web3 Community is Celebrating?\n\nWhat does it mean for Indian Investors, developers, and the startup ecosystem?\n\nA step towards mainstream adoption\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nWith Ethereum firmly established as the world\u2019s second-largest virtual digital asset, the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marks a monumental stride in the crypto sphere. This endorsement carries profound implications, particularly for investors, given Ethereum's robust market presence.Moreover, Ethereum's pivotal role in propelling the mainstream adoption of crypto cannot be overstated. As the market undergoes continuous evolution, Ethereum stands as a cornerstone, guiding the industry toward unprecedented growth and innovation.One of the most compelling narratives surrounding the approval of Ethereum ETFs is their impact on investor confidence . Ethereum has already established a strong market presence, and the introduction of ETFs offers a more structured investment vehicle. The ETF structure provides several advantages, including ease of access, as investors can now purchase Ethereum ETFs through traditional brokerage accounts. Additionally, ETFs offer enhanced protection, as regulatory oversight by the SEC ensures higher standards of security, easing investor skepticism.The introduction of ETFs is particularly important because they contribute to market stability by attracting institutional investors , who bring in new capital and a long-term investment perspective. This will certainly accelerate the growth of the asset class. Additionally, technological upgrades, such as the implementation of roll-up technology and Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, are set to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and efficiency, further strengthening its appeal to institutional investors.The growing optimism surrounding ETH price action is grounded in significant inflow data. For instance, over $58 billion flowed into ten newly launched Bitcoin ETFs within five months of their debut. If Ethereum ETFs follow a similar trajectory, substantial institutional inflows, combined with bullish speculative trading, could swiftly propel ETH prices to new all-time highs. Institutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin ETFs will likely seek to diversify into this newly approved Ethereum ETF.Ethereum plays a crucial role in the decentralized ecosystem, and this regulatory progress is essential for shaping the future of Web3 and the ongoing digital revolution. The SEC's decision is especially significant, given previous media reports suggesting the SEC was investigating the Ethereum Foundation and the ongoing debate about wh ether Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH), should be classified as a security.Classifying Ethereum as a security could have major implications for the Web3 industry. Ethereum underpins a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 projects , which range from DeFi to NFTs and rely heavily on Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions. Recently, the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem has surged, reaching $100 billion, with Ethereum leading the space with over 60% market share. A security designation for Ethereum could have introduced regulatory challenges for dApps built on its network, potentially hindering innovation and growth within the Web3 space.India held the top spot for overall crypto adoption and also ranked first for the on-chain value received through centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms when adjusted for purchasing power parity. The total crypto value received by India in 2023, which was second only to the USA, jumped from ~$170B in 2022 to ~$270B in 2023 indicating a 60% growth. This compares to 10% for the US, 8% for the UK, and 18% for Vietnam. (Source: Hashed Emergent Report)The community remains bullish on digital assets and the wider crypto industry for 2024. Despite the current limitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs being available only to investors in the US and Hong Kong (with a Bitcoin ETF for Hong Kong investors), their introduction has significantly contributed to the global growth of the crypto market. The launch of Ethereum ETFs is expected to further propel this positive momentum.India's share of the global Web3 developer community is fairly big, around 12% of the global figure. There's a network of over 1,000 Web3 startups, a significant percentage building on Ethereum, the largest decentralized ecosystem. This, in turn, will definitely boost the confidence of the developers and entrepreneur community.The approval of Ethereum ETFs signifies a broader trend of crypto integration into the mainstream financial system. It reflects a growing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate and valuable component of investment portfolios. This development is not just about making Ethereum more accessible; it is about bridging the gap between traditional finance and the emerging world of crypto assets.As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its use cases\u2014from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\u2014the ability for investors to participate through ETFs will likely accelerate the adoption of these technologies. The ripple effects of this approval will extend beyond just Ethereum, potentially paving the way for similar financial products for other crypto.The US SEC has approved the 19b-4 filings, and it is anticipated that they will approve the final S-1 forms when these ETFs begin trading soon. The decision affects funds proposed by VanEck Fidelity , Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, and Grayscale."

Ethereum balances are even lower at 10.6%, the lowest since October 2015.\n\nSpot ETFs trigger withdrawals\n\nMarket experts have explained that the declining exchange balances coincide with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of ETF products for Bitcoin and 19-b filings for Ethereum.\n\nHeyApollo data reveals that spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated 857,700 BTC, valued at $58.5 billion, in just five months. BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF leads this acquisition with around $20 billion in assets, followed by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, with approximately $11 billion.\n\nWhile spot Ethereum ETFs have not yet begun trading, investor anticipation has driven significant withdrawals. According to CryptoQuant data, 777,000 ETH, worth about $3 billion, have been pulled from exchanges since the SEC\u2019s approval.\n\nAdditionally, the option to stake ETH has influenced its declining exchange balance. Nansen reports that 32.8 million ETH, or 27% of its total supply, are currently staked to support the network.\n\nIs a supply crunch on the way?\n\nIf the declining exchange balance trend continues, market experts have predicted demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum could lead to a supply crunch.\n\nIn a recent social media post, BTC Echo editor Leon Waidmaan advised investors to brace for a \u201csupply squeeze\u201d and the possibility of \u201cthe next big move.\u201d\n\nHistorically, when digital assets are withdrawn from exchanges, it suggests investors plan to hold rather than sell, reflecting bullish sentiment and expectations of future growth.

Renowne\u00add cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi has pre\u00addicted a significant rally for Ethereum (ETH), sugge\u00adsting the digital asset could see\u00ad substantial gains. Ethereum is currently hovering at $3800, reflecting a notable upward tre\u00adnd following recent corrections and consolidation pe\u00adriods. This recovery phase hints at a pote\u00adntial continuation of Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish tre\u00adnd.\n\nMaster Ke\u00adnobi\u2019s analysis provides a historical overview of Ethe\u00adreum\u2019s price moveme\u00adnts, tracing its performance from early 2016 to the\u00ad present.

        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nEthereum fever has ticked higher over the past two trading days with two companies submitting applications for new funds based on the performance of ether, and a third issuer setting its fee for a proposed spot Ethereum exchange traded fund.\n\nRex Shares proposed separate long and inverse ETFs that depend on the performance of yet-to-debut spot Ethereum funds. A Roundhill Ether Covered Call Strategy ETF fund aims to provide income but also \"exposure to the price return of one or more exchange-traded funds with exposure to ether.\"\n\n\"The Fund will purchase and sell a combination of call and put option contracts that utilize an Ether Futures ETF as the reference asset,\" Roundhill's S-1 registration statement said.\n\nNeither the Rex nor the Roundhill products will invest directly in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the smart contracts Ethereum blockchain.\n\nArk, Franklin Templeton\n\nIn separate, updated S-1 filings, Franklin Templeton announced that it would charge a 0.19% fee for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF, but Ark Investment Management was absent from its latest filing for a similar product that it had initially proposed with 21Shares, which is now listed as the sole issuer for the product.\n\nThe latest developments come as the Securities and Exchange Commission weighs spot Ethereum applications from eight issuers, and amid demand for cryptocurrency-focused assets that has soared this year following the approval of the first spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRead More: SEC Changes Ethereum Rule, Sets Stage for ETF Approval | etf.com\n\nLast month, the regulator permitted a rules change that significantly increased the likelihood that the new spot Ethereum products will begin trading in the not-so-distant future. The spot bitcoin products have generated almost $14 billion in inflows since they debuted on Jan. 11, according to U.K.-based Farside Investors.\n\nEther was recently trading at $3,780, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to cryptocurrency markets provider CoinMarketCap. It has risen 23% during the past month as optimism about a spot Ethereum approval has grown. Bitcoin also rose slightly from the previous day.\n\nT-Rex's New Funds\n\nThe T-Rex 2X Long Ether Daily Target ETF and T-Rex 2X Inverse Daily Target ETF will aim to meet daily investment objectives that, respectively, \"magnify\" the performance of ether and the inverse of to ether's performance with the latter \"a result opposite of most mutual funds and ETFs,\" according to the S-1.

        "content": "An Ethereum buy the dip opportunity might come up in 2024 provided ETH respects its 38.2% ($2,500) and 50% Fibonacci levels ($2,250). In case of a late summer ETH pullback, investors should be patient to assess Ethereum\u2019s buy the dip opportunity.\n\nAs we approach late 2024, analysts predict a shift in Ethereum\u2019s forecasted price trends. It may present a compelling buy-the-dip opportunity for investors looking ahead to 2025.\n\nEthereum in 2024\n\nAccording to InvestingHaven\u2019s predictive ETH model:\n\nIn 2024, Ethereum (ETH) is expected to see a support level at $3,007.53 and a resistance level up to $4,389.27. With an average price projection of $3.698,4, Ethereum might experience a downward adjustment from its current price, suggesting a potential buy opportunity.\n\nOn the flipside, insights from 10 industry experts suggest that ETH may need to move higher in order to be fairly priced:\n\nAnalyzing 10 top crypto experts\u2019 Ethereum price forecast for 2024, their average forecasted price is $6962.1. Excluding a $20,000 outlier, it adjusts to $5,513.44, reflecting varied predictions. Some experts believe ETH is fairly priced currently, however most of them believe ETH should rise some 40% in order to be fairly priced in 2024.\n\nInterestingly, crypto experts align on InvestingHaven\u2019s ETH forecasts:\n\nETH may rise to $4,800 by July 2024, drop to its Fibonacci level $2,560 by October 2024. In doing so, it will create a bullish cup and handle, a buy opportunity before ETH takes off in 2025. InvestingHaven\u2019s ETH price forecast 2025: $5,000 to $10,000.\n\nETH in 2025\n\nAs the year 2025 unfolds, Ethereum\u2019s price is projected to stabilize, maintaining its 2024 support level at $2,163.33. An incremental rise is expected before summer of 2025 indicating a recovery phase.\n\nInterestingly, the chart generated by one of the most accurate predictive crypto algorithms. Although not generated by a human, but calculated by AI based on 10-years of historical price data, it is clear to the human eye that this expected price structure is creating a bullish reversal.\n\nThis underscores the importance of considering 2025 as a strategic point to \u2018buy the dip.\u2019\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s forecaster confirms ETH\u2019s outlook\n\nThe analyst at InvestingHaven confirms the buy the dip expectation, and adds to it that the long term rising trendline on Ethereum\u2019s chart has to hold.\n\nIf so, the setup on the long term chart is likely going to qualify as an epic cup and handle formation which is a very bullish pattern. The outcome of this pattern, in 2025, will likely push ETH well above its former ATH. In fact, InvestingHaven\u2019s analyst predicts that IF the cup and handle materializes properly a potential bullish target of ETH $10k is achievable in the period 2025-2026.\n\nEthereum buy the dip underway?\n\nFor investors, understanding the price dynamics of Ethereum between 2024 and 2025 is crucial.\n\nThe late 2024 anticipated dip could be viewed as a reaction to market adjustments or broader economic factors impacting the cryptocurrency landscape. However, the stability in Ethereum\u2019s price in the first half of 2025\u2014coupled with the bullish impact on its chart\u2014suggests that the market sentiments are favorably aligned for recovery.\n\nThe concept of \u2018buying the dip\u2019 is centered around purchasing an asset when its price has dropped, with the expectation that it will increase in value later. For Ethereum, the late 2024 dip presents such an opportunity, especially when analyzed in conjunction with the expected stabilization and modest growth in 2025.\n\nInvestors should closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s chart pattern as it nears its support levels and consider whether it aligns with their risk tolerance and investment timeline.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while the dip in late 2024 might seem unfavorable, it potentially offers an epic buying opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the cyclical nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBy 2025, the gradual price recovery of Ethereum could well reward those who strategically position themselves during these lower price points. The answer to the question \u201chow profitable can the buy the dip opportunity become\u201d will entirely depend on how ETH will behave around key support at $2,250 and $2,550, and how accurate the cup and handle formation will become.\n\nFollow our premium work to receive timely crypto alerts in 2024 and 2025 >>"

        "content": "Ethereum is trading within a bullish trend channel in the medium to long term. This upward momentum indicates strong positive development, with increasing buy interest from the crypto community. The price is approaching a key resistance level at $4,000, potentially triggering a sell-off or a consolidation phase. However, a decisive breakout above the $4,000 mark would be a highly bullish signal, indicating potential for further gains.\n\nThe positive volume balance indicates strong buying pressure, supporting Ethereum\u2019s short-term bullish outlook. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 68, signifying nuetral conditions after notable price increases over the past weeks. Currently, Ethereum is priced at $3,769.56, with a 24-hour trading volume of $12.02 billion and a market capitalization of $452.86 billion. The ETH price has seen a modest increase of 0.18% in the last 24 hours.\n\nHidden Bullish Pattern Signals Ethereum Rally Towards $4,811\n\nRenowned crypto analyst JAVON MARKS has recently provided an in-depth analysis of Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) market performance, suggesting a significant price surge may be imminent. MARKS has been closely monitoring ETH\u2019s price movements and has identified several key patterns that indicate a potential bullish trend.\n\nInitially, the analyst observed a Hidden Bullish pattern in Ethereum\u2019s chart. This technical pattern is often a precursor to upward price movements, even though it may not be immediately obvious to the broader market. Following this confirmation, ETH experienced a brief continuation of its upward trend. However, this movement was relatively modest and short-lived, described by MARKS as \u201cminuscule.\u201d\n\nEthereum experienced a pullback, a common occurrence in cryptocurrency trading where prices retract before making another significant move. Ethereum\u2019s price action established an even larger Bullish Pattern during this pullback. This new, more pronounced pattern is highly significant because it suggests the potential for a substantial upward continuation.\n\nThe technical analysis from MARKS indicates the new Bullish Pattern can take the price of ETH towards $4,811.9. This target has been derived from historical price moves and pattern projections two keys to technical analysis. These milestones will most probably be accompanied by a massive increment in prices from current levels and big participation by Ethereum in the market.\n\nRelated Reading | Bitcoin Below $68K: Mixed Crypto Trends And Top Gainers Analysis"

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs are on the cusp of hitting the market, says CCData analyst.\n\nOutflows from popular products could hamper a rise in prices.\n\nInvestors will pour $3.9 billion into US spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds within the first 100 days of their launch.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Jacob Joseph, research analyst at cryptocurrency data firm CCData.\n\n\u201cDrawing parallels from the netflows of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US during their initial 100 days, we estimate a potential inflow of $3.9 billion for the US spot Ethereum ETFs,\u201d he told DL News.\n\nJoseph added that ETFs will make the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency more attractive to institutional investors and push Ethereum to a new all-time high.\n\nThe comments come after Ethereum soared 23% since May 20 to $3,830 on the back of optimism around the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the first step of the approval process.\n\nAfter hearing whispers that the SEC would engage with applicants, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas changed his odds for an approval from 25% to 75%.\n\nWhen those rumours proved to be true, people like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz suggested that the regulator\u2019s about-face suggested a warming up to crypto in Washington.\n\nWhatever the reason, the pivot unleashed a wave of optimism among market watchers.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nJoe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of crypto infrastructure firm Consensys, told DL News to expect a \u201cfloodgate\u201d of demand for Ether, which would lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher.\n\nInstitutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin ETFs \u201cwill most likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF,\u201d Lubin said.\n\nElsewhere, Lennix Lai, OKX\u2019s global chief commercial officer, told DL News that institutional investors will pour $500 million into Ethereum ETFs in their first week of trading.\n\nEven as CCData\u2019s Joseph shared the bullishness, he cautioned that \u201cEthereum might face challenges due to outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, similar to the market behaviour observed after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nFollowing the launch of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust experienced over $17.7 billion in outflows, according to BitMEX research.\n\n\u201cWith nearly $11.1 billion currently under management in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, we could see similar outflows from this ETF upon approval, influencing market sentiment,\u201d Joseph said.\n\n\u201cOverall, this effect is likely to be short-lived, as the demand for other ETF products is capable of absorbing the selling pressure over time, as observed with the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nHe told DL News that the US SEC\u2019s recent ETF nod could be fully approved and trading \u201cwithin the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 1.6% over the past 24 hours to trade at $69,050.\n\nEthereum is down 0.5% to 3,770.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

        "title": "Where crypto angel investors should deploy capital after Ethereum ETF approval - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The following is a guest post from Tim Haldorsson, CEO of Lunar Strategy.\n\nIn nine short years, Ethereum has gone from pioneering on-chain smart contracts and programmable crypto to becoming the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. The recent SEC approval of ETH ETFs is just a single step in this journey, albeit a significant milestone that has solidified Ethereum\u2019s status as a mature asset class worthy of serious investment consideration.\n\nThis op-ed will highlight the most promising sectors within the Ethereum ecosystem that I believe angel investors should watch closely to take advantage of this economic momentum.\n\nLayer 2 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nEthereum paved the way for the birth of decentralized on-chain markets, planting the seeds that have blossomed into a global DeFi sector with a market cap of $104.55 billion. DeFi is a complex rabbit hole filled with unique financial mechanisms that are unparalleled in traditional finance. However, they rely on the security, speed, and decentralization offered by Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts. Layer 2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and zkSync have emerged to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues, reducing usage costs and increasing transaction speeds without sacrificing privacy or security. These improvements make Ethereum\u2019s technology more accessible and perfect for DeFi activities.\n\nIn the DeFi space, projects like lending and borrowing platforms, futures and perpetuals trading platforms, token seeding and launching platforms, and both centralized and decentralized exchanges have proven immensely successful. Even in the days when ETH only commanded the attention of a small niche of market participants, these technologies were spun into a myriad of business models that proved a real demand for DeFi solutions on a grand scale. Some of the top DeFi protocols have even grown to multi-billion dollar valuations, underscoring the strength of this sector.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions into a recognized commodity, the potential for further growth in DeFi becomes even more certain, making it a lucrative area for angel investors to deploy capital.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence is one of the most important technologies of our time, comparable to the impact of blockchain technology. The world needs AI technologies that can be trusted and that are free from centralized control.\n\nBlockchain enables secure, private, and decentralized frameworks for AI services, crucial for preventing monopolies on scarce compute resources and for providing broader access to decentralized machine learning networks. By leveraging Ethereum\u2019s blockchain for AI projects, developers are already building AI services that remain secure and decentralized.\n\nThis intersection of AI and blockchain is an attractive playing field for investment, as the demand for decentralized and secure AI solutions continues to rise. AI projects built on Ethereum have already achieved multi-billion dollar market caps, showing discerning observers that it is a powder keg of explosive growth. The recent approval of ETH ETFs might be the spark that ignites the next leg of expansion this sector is primed for.\n\nDecentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN)\n\nDePIN is one of the exciting blockchain-dependent sectors that have emerged thanks to the miracle of smart contracts. In a nutshell, it merges physical infrastructure with digital networks of decentralized participants and facilitates the global exchange of limited but in-demand resources like sensors, data storage, or wireless connectivity in return for crypto tokens.\n\nDePINs offer decentralized governance, peer-to-peer infrastructure sharing, tokenization, and enhanced security and privacy for traditional and digital industries.\n\nAs demand for DePINs grows, so will the market for these resources, driving token appreciation and market expansion. Ethereum powers the smart contracts that run these DePINs, making it a crucial component of this ecosystem. With the recent approval of ETH ETFs, more angel investors are likely to turn their attention to DePINs, recognizing their potential for high returns and significant real world impact.\n\nETH Restaking\n\nStaking is a fundamental aspect of securing decentralized networks like Ethereum through economic game theory. Validators, who run the nodes powering the blockchain, are required to stake ETH. If they follow the rules, they earn rewards; if they attempt to cheat, they lose their staked ETH. Currently, over $100 billion worth of ETH is staked\u2014that\u2019s how important this mechanism is to operating blockchain networks.\n\nRestaking takes this concept further by applying the same game theory to secure any protocol on the blockchain. This enables smaller participants to maintain high levels of security through proof-of-stake mechanisms that would otherwise be unattainable. Restaking helps to create a more resilient network for multiple protocols, making it cost-prohibitive to attack any single participant within the larger proof-of-stake pool.\n\nLiquid restaking services further simplify the process for those seeking to stake tokens without managing complex validators. These services issue Liquid Restaking Tokens, which accrue yield and interest from validator rewards and can be traded or restaked to generate additional rewards. This sector\u2019s growth underscores its importance as a security mainstay for blockchains, making it a compelling area for angel investors.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe approval of ETH ETFs has stamped Ethereum as a leading investment vehicle. The Ethereum ecosystem offers many exciting opportunities for angel investors, from Layer 2 DeFi and AI integration, to DePINs and restaking.\n\nIt\u2019s important to study these sectors and understand both their leading narratives and growth catalysts. This way, investors can deploy smart capital while contributing to the growth of Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum news: massive withdrawal of ETH from centralized exchanges after the approval of ETFs - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "According to the latest news, recently over 3 billion dollars of ETH have been withdrawn from centralized exchanges (CEX) after the approval of Ethereum ETFs in the United States. What does this mean? Let\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nLatest news: The approval of Ethereum ETFs in the USA triggers the withdrawal of ETH from centralized exchanges\n\nAs anticipated, since the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) on Ether in the United States on May 23, over 3 billion dollars of Ethereum have been withdrawn from centralized crypto exchanges (CEX).\n\nIndicating a possible imminent contraction of the supply. The data from CryptoQuant show that between May 23 and June 2 the amount of Ether held on exchanges decreased by approximately 797,000 ETH, equivalent to 3.02 billion dollars.\n\nThis decline in reserves indicates that fewer coins are available for immediate sale, as investors transfer their holdings to self-custody for various purposes other than immediate sale.\n\nAccording to the data shared by the BTC-ECHO analyst Leon Waidmann, coming from Glassnode, the percentage of circulating Ether supply held on exchanges is currently at the lowest level in recent years, standing at just 10.6%.\n\nThe decrease in the available supply on exchanges could contribute to increasing the demand pressure on Ether. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggests a \u201clegitimate possibility\u201d of the launch of Ether ETFs by the end of June.\n\nSome analysts hypothesize that the trading of spot ETFs on ETH could increase the demand for Ethereum.\n\nPushing the price beyond the all-time high of $4,870 reached in November 2021, similar to the effect observed with Bitcoin after the introduction of spot ETFs on Bitcoin in January.\n\nThe political influence on the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum\n\nCompared to Bitcoin, Ether could benefit even more from demand pressures due to its lower \u201cstructural selling pressure,\u201d as indicated in a report by DeFi analyst Michael Nadeau.\n\nWhile Bitcoin miners occasionally sell BTC to cover mining expenses, Ethereum validators do not face the same operational costs. Potentially contributing to a stronger price performance for Ether.\n\nHowever, there are concerns regarding the influence of the Ethereum Trust (ETHE) by Grayscale, which manages 11 billion dollars of funds, on the price action of Ether.\n\nIf it follows the model of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), significant outflows from ETHE could occur, influencing the price of Ether.\n\nThe Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum was likely influenced by political decisions rather than purely financial considerations.\n\nIn a recent interview, Seyffart suggested that the political climate, including the actions of the Biden administration and the responses of the crypto community, played a significant role in the approval.\n\nSeyffart also noted that, in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the approval of other ETFs on criptovalute, including Solana, is unlikely without significant regulatory changes.\n\nHe indeed emphasized the need for a regulated market to monitor these assets in search of fraud and manipulations.\n\nOn the other hand, the investor and cryptocurrency trader Brian Kelly has suggested that Solana could potentially become the next cryptocurrency to have a spot ETF in the United States.\n\nIn a recent episode of \u201cFast Money\u201d on CNBC, Kelly, founder and CEO of the BKCM Digital Asset Fund, raised the question:"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor years, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor refrained from acknowledging the existence of such a thing as the \u201ccrypto industry.\u201d To him, there was Bitcoin\u2014an asset he likened to the gold of our time\u2014and then thousands of cheap imitators hardly worth mentioning.\n\n\u201cThere is no second best,\u201d the entrepreneur\u2014who may personally own more than one billion dollars worth of BTC\u2014was known to say.\n\nThat is, at least, until now.\n\nIt appears that the shocking, eleventh-hour approval of spot Ethereum ETFs two weeks ago has caused the Bitcoin maximalist to shift his stance on crypto\u2014or at the very least, to adjust his political calculus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment\u2014and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset,\u201d Saylor said recently on the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast, summarizing his thinking prior to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s about-face approval of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nFor quite some time prior to that watershed moment, Saylor had loudly predicted that no other crypto asset besides Bitcoin would ever gain that crucial stamp of approval from traditional finance. He also claimed that Ethereum would be designated a security by the SEC.\n\nNow, the Ethereum ETF approval\u2014which some industry analysts suggest means that Ethereum cannot be considered a security\u2014appears to have changed his views on the viability of crypto as an industry bigger than just Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI think right now the best expectation is [that] the crypto asset class will be legitimized,\u201d Saylor said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn particular, the entrepreneur appeared impressed by industry-wide efforts that have resulted in a recent string of key political victories, including the spot Ethereum ETF approval.\n\n\u201cI think that we are politically much more powerful [when] supported by the entire crypto industry,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cThey obviously have a lot of political power, a lot of users.\u201d\n\nSaylor\u2019s MicroStrategy holds over 1% of all BTC in circulation\u2014a sum currently worth more than $14 billion. He has long resisted calls to invest in any other crypto assets.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to note that Saylor had previously claimed that Ethereum would be declared an unregistered security by the SEC."

        "content": "More than 800,000 ether (ETH) worth approximately $3 billion has left crypto exchanges since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF).\n\nAccording to a Quicktake by CryptoQuant analyst Burakkesmeci, the identities of the crypto investors behind the ETH moves remain unknown; however, there are speculations as to who they could be.\n\nOver 800K ETH Leaves Exchanges\n\nThe SEC greenlit the spot Ethereum ETFs for public listing on national securities exchanges on May 23 in a surprising turn for the crypto industry. The agency began to engage with the potential issuers a few days before the announcement and approved multiple 19b-4 applications to list the products afterward.\n\nDespite the approval, the products were not cleared for trading immediately. The issuers must submit their S-1 registration statements in the coming weeks before the ETFs can go live. Analysts suggest that the first wave of the ETFs could launch by late June.\n\nWhile the crypto community awaits the ETF launch, the large ETH outflow from exchanges within the past week raises concerns. Burakkesmeci said individual investors or institutions could be behind the outflows, noting that the market witnessed similar BTC moves after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in mid-January.\n\nPer Burakkesmeci\u2019s analysis, ETH whales or individual investors could be behind the outflows because they think the cryptocurrency\u2019s price will rally due to the approvals. On the other hand, institutions and ETF issuers could be making the moves in preparation for the launch of the products. The CryptoQuant analyst said these entities may be preparing to meet the spot Ethereum ETF demand from investors in the coming months.\n\nA Positive Impact on ETH\n\nRegardless of the cohort of investors behind the outflows, Burakkesmeci expects such moves to trigger an ETH rally soon.\n\n\u201cThe above answers are each an assumption, but we can expect that the withdrawal of more than 800,000 Ethereum from exchanges in 8 days will have a positive impact on the price in the medium term,\u201d he stated.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that ETH could explode to $20,000 following the launch of the ETFs. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $3,800, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. If the predictions were to come true, the market would see the crypto asset surge over 420%."

        "content": "In May, Ethereum (ETH) experienced a robust 27% increase in price, predominantly occurring within the final ten days subsequent to the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF. Despite currently stabilizing around $3,800 levels, on-chain advancements indicate the potential for significant price surges in the near future.\n\nEthereum Whale and Institutional Interest Growing\n\nAs per data from CryptoQuant, ever since the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF on May 23, more than 800,000 Ethereum coins have moved off exchanges in the last ten days. CryptoQuant reports that either whales or institutions have been preparing for the spot Ethereum ETF to go live for trading.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThus, this particular investor cohort could be behind moving these ETH off exchanges thus moving them to self-custody. This lower exchange supply is a bullish indicator since fewer coins would be available for selling. furthermore, the percentage of Ethereum supply at the exchange has dropped to the lowest in many years, currently at 10.6%.\n\nFurthermore, the beacon-chain data shows that the Ethereum staking activity has picked up pace again since May 30. Starting from May 30, a significant number of investors initiated coin staking activities following a three-day period of withdrawals. This withdrawal streak led to the total staked amount dropping to a weekly low of 32,193,980 ETH.\n\nIn the past 72 hours alone, staking deposits on the beacon chain increased by 175,358 ETH. At present market prices, these recently staked coins hold a value of approximately $661 million.\n\nETH Price To New All-Time High\n\nAfter last week\u2019s sell-off, the Ethereum (ETH) price has been holding strong support at $3,750 and faces resistance at $3,830 on the upside. Once it crosses this, the ETH price could be eyeing a move above $4,000 and further to its new all-time high levels.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that there\u2019s a legit possibility of getting the spot Ethereum ETF approved by June end. Furthermore, some market analysts also believe that the ETH price could break past its all-time high of $,4870 once the spot Ethereum ETF starts trading, amid the demand pressure, similar to what happened after the Bitcoin ETF launch. However, some market analysts believe that the Ethereum ETF will see only 20% inflows to that of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn the other hand, investors would have some concerns about Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). If ETHE, with over $11 billion in AUM, becomes a spot Ethereum ETF, it could also face outflows similar to GBTC.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

I assume that it's true for all the other applicants for the spot ETF approval,\" the VanEck CEO added.\n\nRegulatory developments\n\nFollowing the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act in the U.S. House of Representatives with substantial support from Democratic lawmakers, van Eck now says that there is a \"real risk\" that the SEC was going to lose its authority in the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the VanEck boss, this development prompted the SEC to swiftly approve multiple Ethereum ETFs earlier this month.\n\nHowever, he also believes that there are other factors in play as well.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , multiple ETF analysts as well as legal experts have been stunned by the sudden U-turn.\n\nWill Ether ETFs flop?\n\nEven though there is a lot of excitement surrounding Ethereum ETFs, banking giant JPMorgan believes that these products could attract a much lower share of inflows than expected.\n\nThe largest U.S. bank believes that these ETFs will receive a relatively modest $3 billion worth of inflows in 2024. However, this amount could double if staking is allowed."

Ripple (XRP) also follows BTC\u2019s footsteps as it continues on its 50-day consolidation streak. Ethereum (ETH) price, on the other hand, shows signs of an incoming correction.\n\nBitcoin price ready for triangle breakout\n\nBitcoin price has produced three lower highs and higher lows since May 19. Connecting these swing points using a trend line reveals a symmetrical triangle formation in the 4-hour chart. This technical pattern has no bias, and the target is obtained by adding the triangle\u2019s height to the breakout point.\n\nAssuming BTC triggers a bullish breakout at roughly $67,700, the height of the triangle sets the target near $73,777, its all-time high.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, if BTC breaks the upward trendline of the triangle and closes below $67,700, the bullish thesis could be invalidated, leading to a crash of 8%, which is the technical target given by the height of the triangle, to $61,734.\n\nEthereum price looks promising\n\nEthereum's price broke above a falling wedge pattern in the 4-hour chart on May 20 and rallied 21%. However, the bearish order block from March 12, extending from $3,980 to $4,093, is rejecting ETH price.\n\nInvestors looking to buy ETH could do so at the following levels:\n\nAt the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the swing high of $3,984 on May 27 to the swing low of $2,864 on May 13, at $3,424. At the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the same movement at $3,279.\n\nIf the conditions mentioned above are to play out, then the Ethereum price could revisit its previous resistance level at $4,000.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $2,864 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 9% crash to the previous support level of $2,600.\n\nRipple price to end the consolidation phase\n\nRipple price is currently consolidating between $0.571 and $0.467 after a major 33% fall in mid-April. This 49-day consolidation has seen XRP volume weakening.\n\nIf Ripple price breaks above $0.571 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the swing high of $0.744 on March 11 to the swing low of $0.419 on April 14 at $0.581, it could rally 8% to revisit the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $0.621.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, if the Ripple daily candlestick closes below $0.467, then XRP could crash an additional 10% to its previous support at $0.419."

        "content": "Mon 03 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe price of Ethereum has surged by nearly 67% since the beginning of 2024, driven by a series of favorable developments. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC, as well as major updates to its network, have boosted investor appetite for this leading cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum, a safe bet in 2024!\n\nThe year 2024 promises to be extremely promising for Ethereum. The second cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization has already shown a significant price increase, around 67% since January. This surge can be explained in particular by the much-anticipated approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the American financial watchdog, the SEC, on May 23rd.\n\nOn the technical side, the scenario seems particularly favorable for the cryptocurrency. The upward break of the historical descending wedge at the end of May, accompanied by a resurgence in activity, opened the door to an intermediate target of around $4,250 by the end of June, representing additional upside potential of 12.65%.\n\nSeveral analysts believe that a powerful upward movement of great magnitude could be set in motion for altcoins. Its outcome could propel Ethereum to the vicinity of $6,000 by early July, an enticing prospect for investors.\n\nGrowing institutional interest in the second cryptocurrency\n\nAccording to data from the analysis platform Santiment, the largest whales in the market significantly strengthened their positions on Ethereum from May 20th, when the first rumors about the approval of ETFs emerged.\n\nInstitutional investors, represented by these entities with the largest reserves (10 to 100 million ETH), seem to have anticipated this move. Their held supply recently increased by about 0.5%, indicating a renewed appetite.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum reserves on exchanges have significantly declined, reflecting an increased willingness of holders to secure their assets off centralized platforms.\n\nIn summary, driven by favorable regulatory and technical developments, Ethereum seems well-positioned to continue its impressive upward trajectory in the coming weeks. The road to $4,000, or even beyond, remains wide open for this now indispensable cryptocurrency.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecasts: Where Is ETH Headed After the ETF Approvals? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETFs has increased volatility, with analysts predicting potential rallies and significant future growth.\n\nPositive on-chain metrics, like rising TVL and negative exchange netflow, indicate a possible bull run for Ethereum.\n\nETH\u2019s Next Possible Step\n\nEthereum made the headlines last week after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially greenlighted the launch of ETH ETFs in the world\u2019s largest economy. The approval happened on May 24, and somewhat expectedly, it caused enhanced volatility for the asset.\n\nIts price passed through severe ups and downs in the range of $3,650-$3,950 before settling to its current level of around $3,800 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data).\n\nThe X user Jelle argued that ETH is consolidating above \u201cthe key support area\u201d of approximately $3,750, expecting \u201cthe market to chop around this area for a while, at least until Monday.\u201d The analyst advised investors not to \u201cfall for the boredom stakeout,\u201d predicting a rally above the $4,500 mark in the following months.\n\nYoddha and Satoshi Flipper were also optimistic. The former claimed that ETH\u2019s bull cycle is about to begin and could fuel a price explosion of as high as $20,000.\n\nSatoshi Flipper envisioned a bright future for Ethereum based on the assumption that major world banks and financial institutions will enter its ecosystem after the SEC gave the thumbs up on the aforementioned ETFs.\n\nRecall that one of Singapore\u2019s largest banks\u2014DBS Bank\u2014was recently revealed as a crypto whale, holding 173,753 ETH. Currently, the stash is valued at almost $670 million.\n\nTaking a Closer Look at On-Chain Metrics\n\nETH\u2019s price has soared substantially in the past year, marking a jump of over 100%. The positive trend coincides with the rise of essential metrics surrounding the ecosystem.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, the total value locked on Ethereum has risen impressively since October 2023 and currently stands at almost $65 billion. TVL is a key indicator that refers to the total value of assets currently being staked, lent, borrowed, or otherwise utilized within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIts increase suggests that more capital is flowing into the ecosystem, which could, in turn, reflect positive market sentiment.\n\nAnother bullish metric is the Ethereum exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the last seven days. Some may consider the shift from centralized platforms to self-custody methods as bullish for ETH\u2019s valuation since it reduces the immediate selling pressure."

        "content": "Fibonacci levels and the OBV supported the idea of a bullish ETC\n\nLiquidity pocket below a key support level could attract prices to it\n\nEthereum Classic [ETC] saw a strong breakout past the $29-resistance level on 20 May. The subsequent hype around the approval of spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds [ETFs] also benefited Ethereum Classic. That\u2019s not all either, with the network seeing its fourth halving on 31 May.\n\nNow, the last ten days have seen some volatility around the $32-level, but ETC shed 8% of its value in just five days. Ergo, the question \u2013 Is its next price move set in motion, or was this a healthy pullback before another move higher?\n\nRe-test of a vital ETC support level\n\nSince 13 April, the $29.1-level has been a stern resistance level for the bulls. They were unable to beat the bears until 20 May. The OBV had been rising for a month by that point and something had to give.\n\nThe breakout strength was also aided by the hype around Ethereum, which invariably has a positive effect on ETC as well. Since then, the momentum has slowed down. This was seen by the RSI\u2019s drop to 49.\n\nEthereum Classic retested the $29 former resistance level as support and is expected to react positively. However, some lower timeframe volatility could develop on Monday.\n\nBased on its early 2024 rally, the retracement in March and April did not fall under the 78.6% level at $22.5. At press time, the 50% level at $29 was the support, which suggested that a move towards its $39.7 high could follow in the coming weeks.\n\nLiquidity pocket below $29 as a magnetic zone\n\nThough the $29-level would likely see a bounce, it might come after a sweep of the $28.4-level. The one-month look back liquidation levels heatmap revealed that the $28.4-$29 zone was filled with short liquidations.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Classic Profit Calculator\n\nA move into this zone would collect the liquidity present here before the next rally. Hence, traders should use a drop towards $28 as a buying opportunity based on the evidence at hand.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "The balance of Ethereum (ETH) on centralized exchanges is dropping at a fast rate since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether ETF products.\n\nEthereum Liquidity Drain\n\nCentralized trading platforms are regarded as the primary avenue through which most traders get access to cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The availability of this coin is already being threatened as hinted by top market analyst Ali Martinez.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a recent post on X, Martinez noted that since the spot Ethereum ETF products were approved in the US, approximately 777,000 ETH, valued at about $3 billion have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges. While the ETH ETF products are yet to start trading officially on exchanges, a sustenance of this trend might play a major role in shaping the price action of ETH in the long term.\n\nOne intriguing trend in the chart shared by the analyst is that the current Ethereum balance on exchanges is the lowest the coin has recorded since at least December 11 2023. Judging by the massive rate of institutional investment in Bitcoin through its spot ETF products, Ethereum might suffer a supply shock in no time.\n\nShould Ether spot ETF experience a similar accumulation like Bitcoin, it can help shoot the price of Ethereum forward within a very short time. The same experience was recorded for Bitcoin as the corporate capital inflow dragged the price of the coin to a new All-Time High (ATH) above $73,000 in March.\n\nMany market analysts have postulated that all ETH need to breach its former ATH at $4,891.70 is the full launch of the spot Ethereum ETF product. Should the best case scenario play out, Standard Chartered postulates that the coin may soar to $8,000 by the end of this year.\n\nOther ETH Growth Catalysts\n\nBesides the spot ETF product, Ethereum also boasts of different fundamentals that can help drive its price in the long term. The digital currency is naturally deflationary with small amounts of the token scored from transaction fees burnt and taken away from circulation.\n\nAs a blockchain, Ethereum is also innovating in a remarkable way with different upgrades and innovation to make its Layer-2 protocols function optimally. When all this factors come together, chances are that the price of Ethereum will break free from its current stagnant trend to print a mega rally moving forward.\n\nRead More: Missed Pepe Coin, Here\u2019re 3 Ethereum Meme Coins To Buy In June\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange balance has been on a decline.\n\nTechnical analysis indicates significant price movements for both cryptocurrencies if key resistance levels are broken.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] was trading just shy of $70,000 at press time, reflecting a moderate upswing of 2% in the last 24 hours, though it remains below its March peak of over $73,000.\n\nThis continued growth from the asset is part of a broader narrative that underscores the complexities of crypto market movements.\n\nConversely, Ethereum [ETH] has shown remarkable stability, maintaining a position above $3,800. This steadiness comes despite a slight 2.5% drop over the last day, stabilizing with a minimal 0.7% increase today.\n\nThe stability in Ethereum\u2019s price points to a sustained interest in the asset amid fluctuating market conditions.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum market shifts\n\nRecent analysis by BTC-ECHO\u2019s Leon Waidmann revealed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have witnessed their lowest exchange balance levels in years.\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin\u2019s presence on exchanges has reduced to 11.6% while Ethereum\u2019s has dipped to 10.6%.\n\nThis trend suggests a significant movement of these assets away from exchanges and potentially indicates a strategy among investors to hold onto their coins for longer periods.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of CryptoQuant data further revealed a substantial outflow of these cryptocurrencies from exchanges.\n\nOver $5 million worth of Bitcoin and more than $1 billion in Ethereum have withdrawn from exchanges since early May.\n\nThis movement is noteworthy as it follows the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the US, hinting at a possible supply squeeze on the horizon.\n\nThe reduction in exchange reserves implies that fewer coins are now available for immediate trading, pointing to a potential price increase due to scarcity.\n\nWaidmann anticipates this will lead to a supply squeeze, urging investors to prepare for significant market movements, noting:\n\n\u201cWhales continue to accumulate. Supply squeeze incoming. Get ready for the next big move.\u201d\n\nMarket dynamics and technical analysis\n\nHowever, Glassnode data presents a contrasting view, showing an increase in the circulating supply for both cryptocurrencies, suggesting that despite reduced exchange availability, the overall market supply remains high.\n\nThis scenario sets the stage for potential price corrections if demand fails to keep pace with the increasing supply. However, the current market indicators suggest demand is keeping up, as there has been no notable price dip despite the growing supply.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a decline in new addresses for both Bitcoin and Ethereum which could indicate a cooling interest among new investors, potentially impacting future demand.\n\nMeanwhile, technical analysis of both Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s charts reveals a potentially intriguing performance on the horizon.\n\nFocusing on Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart, it illustrates a pattern where the cryptocurrency has been breaking through lower support levels, recently reversing to tap into a major supply zone.\n\nThis movement typically signals a continuation of the downtrend. However, if Bitcoin surpasses the $72,000 mark, breaking the previous lower high and negating the bearish setup, this could suggest a reversal to an upward trend.\n\nAMBCrypto, citing an analyst from XBTManager on CryptoQuant, reported that Bitcoin is poised for a notable ascent. The analyst suggests,\n\n\u201cBitcoin is gathering strength for the next rise. When it gathers enough strength, a sharp rise seems to be imminent. It seems likely that rises akin to those seen in Q3-Q4 will continue.\u201d\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nA similar pattern emerges on Ethereum\u2019s daily chart. Ethereum has recently entered a major supply zone, suggesting an impending sell-off.\n\nNonetheless, if Ethereum breaks above the $4,000 threshold, surpassing the recent lower high and overturning the current sell signal, this could pave the way for an upward movement."

Over the past week, Ethereum saw $33.5 million in inflows which pushed its monthly inflows upwards of $21 million.\n\nAltcoins Follow Ethereum\u2019s Lead with Inflows\n\nInvestment products focused on digital assets experienced an influx of capital for the fourth week in a row, amounting to $185 million. The month of May witnessed inflows totaling $2 billion, driving the year-to-date inflows past the whopping $15 billion mark.\n\nHowever, trading volumes decreased during the week, dropping from $13 billion in the previous week to $8 billion, as per the latest edition of CoinShares\u2019 Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin witnessed inflows amounting to $148 million, while short-BTC encountered another week of outflows totaling $3.5 million, indicating continued positive sentiment among ETF investors.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, other investment products based on altcoins also saw comparable inflows for the week. Solana led with $5.8 million in inflows, trailed by Chainlink with $1 million. Following behind are XRP with $0.8 million, Litecoin with $0.6 million, and Cardano with $0.3 million during the same period.\n\nDespite recent achievements in direct investments in digital assets, blockchain equities have continued to face challenges, with outflows of $7.2 million observed last week and a total of $516 million outflows recorded this year.\n\nUnited States Leads Weekly Inflow\n\nThe United States dominated the weekly inflows, recording a $130 million influx. Switzerland also witnessed significant inflows amounting to $36.8 million during the same week. Canada followed closely with the next highest inflows of $24.6 million.\n\nWhile Hong Kong, Australia, and Germany experienced modest inflows of $1.7 million, $1.4 million, and $0.5 million respectively, Sweden and Brazil saw outflows. Sweden recorded outflows of $5.1 million, while Brazil had outflows of $4.4 million for the week."

        "title": "3 Ethereum Rivals To Buy If You Missed Solana - CoinGape",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry is an ocean of opportunities, often snapped up by fast fingers. Many times if the ship sails before getting on board, it\u2019s an uphill battle to catch up\u2014and if you do, you could end up sinking with the same ship. However, there are plenty of second chances, thirds, fourths, and even fifths. For this reason, investors who may have missed out on the Solana rally could consider leading Ethereum rivals like XRP, SHIB, and LUNC.\n\nWhy Buy Ethereum Rivals\n\nSolana has since its inception been a noteworthy rival to the world\u2019s second-leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum. The token boasts an efficient blockchain, scalable and able to support a high transaction throughput at a fraction of the fees charged to send value on Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLike Solana, other Ethereum rivals emerged with immense potential. For instance, XRP runs on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) which supports value transfer across international borders. The network has over the years partnered with banking institutions using its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform to send and receive money.\n\nShiba Inu, on the other hand, started as a meme coin rival to Dogecoin. However, the token has transformed from a simple dog-themed joke cryptocurrency to a powerhouse hosting other tokens and scaling networks like Shibarium. SHIB is very affordable compared to Ethereum\u2019s at $3,800.\n\nThe Terra Classic community has shown resilience since its downfall in 2022. After crashing almost to zero LUNC has continued to rally, aiming to reach $1 in the next bull market.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP holds above the crucial $0.52 support on Friday amid increasing signs of an inbound bullish move.\n\nMarket factors are strong for Bitcoin and altcoins. The approval of Ethereum ETFs raised the stakes for XRP and Solana to receive similar products in the future.\n\nXRP stands out as the eighth largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $28 billion. With a green candle established on the four-hour chart, this could be a good chance for traders to seek exposure to longs ahead of a larger move up.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the same time frame is starting to reinforce the bullish grip with potential. Should the RSI cross above the descending trend line and close the gap to the midline in the neutral area, the path of least resistance would uphold the uptrend.\n\nThe increasing four-hour candle shows that buyers have the upper hand. However, for XRP to establish a sustainable uptrend, all three exponential moving averages (EMAs) must flip to provide support. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) dons a bullish signal likely to encourage traders to consider buying XRP. A major rally would erupt if resistance at $0.56 is broken, paving the way for a smooth path to $1.\n\n2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nData from CoinGecko shows Shiba Inu price traded around $0.00002573 during European hours, a 3.6% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 6.6% increase in 7 days.\n\nSHIB price is currently in an ascending triangle and almost at the end. Ascending triangles show investors\u2019 interest and accumulation as the highs remain relatively flat with lows rising higher. If the market structure holds, Shiba Inu may break out on the upside and rally 32% to around $0.000036.\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price fundamentals are strong as the meme coin rides in favor of its huge community. Coinbase Futures recently announced support for SHIB perpetual futures, with trading beginning on May 30, 2024.\n\nSeveral renowned crypto analysts have also called for imminent SHIB price breakouts in the near future. Ali Martinez suggested a 20% upswing in price if the SHIB price breaks above $0.000025.\n\n3. Terra Classic (LUNC)\n\nOver the past week, LUNC price has been trading upward, with an 8% surge driven by increasing market optimism and renewed investor interest. Additionally, in the past month, this token experienced a steady rise of 15%, trading in a range of $0.0001 to $0.00012, reflecting a positive market sentiment.\n\nAs bullish sentiment gains momentum, Terra Classic (LUNC) could surpass the $0.00013 mark, signaling a renewed upward trend. This positive market shift might push the Terra Classic price toward breaching the resistance at $0.0002, aiming for $0.0005 in the next bullish cycle.\n\nBottom Line\n\nComing up with a winning crypto portfolio is not an easy feat for many. However, investors who focus on solid narratives like Ethereum and its popular rivals are on the path to achieving more from their holdings. A potential bull run in 2024 could turn the fortunes of ordinary people to achieve immense success.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum On Exchanges Drop To New Lows, What A Supply Squeeze Would Mean For The Market - TradingView",
        "content": "Recent data shows that the supply of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on exchanges has dropped significantly. This means the largest crypto tokens by market cap could be well-primed for significant moves to the upside, with a supply squeeze imminent.\n\nSupply Of Bitcoin And Ethereum Drop To New Lows\n\nBTC ECHO analyst Leon Waidmann shared Glassnode data, which showed that exchange balances for Bitcoin and Ethereum are at their lowest in years. Bitcoin\u2019s supply on exchanges has dropped to 11.6%, while Ethereum\u2019s supply has dropped to 10.6%. This suggests that crypto whales have been accumulating these crypto tokens and moving them to self-custody.\n\nWaidmann highlighted the significance of this development, noting that a supply squeeze was imminent. This supply squeeze could help drive up the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum since most investors look to be accumulating at the moment rather than offloading their holdings. In line with this, the analyst urged his followers to get \u201cready for the next big move.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that this move might have begun following the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. He stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that almost 777,000 ETH ($3 billion) have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved these funds.\n\nOnce they finally launch, these Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to kick the bull run into full gear. As such, it isn\u2019t surprising that these crypto whales are looking to position themselves ahead of this development. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted these funds will likely begin trading by July.\n\nHowever, research firm Kaiko has warned that these funds may not instantly send Ethereum\u2019s price to new all-time highs (ATHs). The second-largest crypto token will likely face significant selling pressure thanks to the potential outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF. This is based on the $6.5 billion outflows that Grayscale\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded in its first month of trading, which led to a significant decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nETH Could Hit A New All-Time High In Record Time\n\nCrypto analyst Michael Nadeau suggested that Ethereum could still hit a new ATH once the Spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading faster than Bitcoin did following the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that Ethereum doesn\u2019t have the same amount of \u201cstructure selling\u201d that Bitcoin encounters since ETH validators do not have to sell their holdings to offset operating costs, unlike Bitcoin miners.\n\nHe also highlighted that 38% of Ethereum\u2019s supply is locked on-chain and claimed that \u201cETH is more reflexive than BTC.\u201d He further explained that this reflexivity is evident in how Ethereum leads in on-chain activity, which leads to more ETH burned. Considering this, Grayscale\u2019s outflows may not impact Ethereum\u2019s price as they did on Bitcoin\u2019s price, which could cause the second-largest crypto token to hit a new ATH in no time."

        "title": "Warning signs for Ethereum\u2019s price? Traders, watch out for this index! - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s metrics revealed bulls have a reason to be concerned, despite its recent rally\n\nHigher timeframe bias was bullish, but a 2% -7% drop might happen within a week or two\n\nOn 20 May, Ethereum [ETH] surged past its critical resistance zone at $3.1k after three weeks of trying. This move came soon after news of the spot Ethereum ETF\u2019s approval broke out, with an official approval coming on 23 May.\n\nSince the surge, however, the trading volume has fallen to the levels it was at earlier in May. The NFT marketplace also saw a notable drop in activity. Additionally, U.S.-based investor interest has slumped too.\n\nCoinbase Premium reached 2024\u2019s lows\n\nThe Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index is the percent difference between the Coinbase ETH/USD pair and the ETH/USDT pair on Binance. It is a good indicator of the interest levels from investors in the U.S since they can access Coinbase and not Binance.\n\nBack in August 2023, the premium saw a sharp fall to reach -0.16. Just ten days later, the price of Ethereum fell from $1.8k to $1.6k. While the Premium Index does not presage every price drop, a decline in this metric is a notable clue that demand on the other side of the Atlantic may be falling.\n\nOn 29 May, it fell to -0.141 \u2013 A sign of shrinking demand even as Ethereum traded above the $3.7k-level.\n\nOther clues that ETH prices might retrace soon\n\nThe liquidation levels data from Hyblock revealed that the cumulative liq levels delta was firmly negative. Now, while it has improved over the past two days, the short positions comfortably outweighed the longs.\n\nHence, to trigger the liquidations of many of these bears, the prices might jump higher. For example, the price action on 31 May saw a similar scenario play out. The long liquidation levels clustered at $3.7k, just 2.4% lower than the market price at press time, could be taken out before a bounce.\n\nThe cyan box from $3540 to $3640 highlighted a demand zone from March. The market structure was bullish, and this demand zone is important in the short-term. The OBV was unable to clear a lower high from April, which pointed to a lack of consistent demand during its recent rally. The indicator also reinforced the likelihood of a price drop towards $3.6k.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe long-term trend is upward based on the Fibonacci retracement levels. The rally earlier this year retraced to the 61.8% level at $2.9k and saw a recovery in May."

        "content": "Recent data shows that Kraken, one of the premier crypto exchanges in the market, has witnessed its largest outflows of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) since 2017. This signals a significant shift in digital asset holdings, which could have broad implications for the market.\n\nKraken\u2019s Historic Outflows, What Is Going On?\n\nInsights from Joao Wedson of Dominando Cripto shared on CryptoQuant\u2019s quick-take platform highlight a startling trend at Kraken. The exchange recorded an outflow of 49,100 BTC, translating to approximately $3.33 billion.\n\nThis massive withdrawal marks the largest movement of funds from the exchange in dollar terms. Ethereum was not left behind, with roughly 572,100 ETH, valued at around $2.15 billion, also exiting the platform.\n\nThis substantial reduction has brought Kraken\u2019s Bitcoin reserves down to levels last seen in 2018, holding about 122,300 BTC. Even more notably, Ethereum reserves have dipped below one million for the first time since early 2016.\n\nKraken: Largest $BTC and $ETH Outflows Since 2017! \u201cKraken\u2019s #Bitcoin reserves have dropped to the same level as in 2018, now holding 122,300 BTC. For #Ethereum, this is the first time Kraken\u2019s reserves have fallen below 1 million units, a level not seen since early 2016.\u201d \u2013 By\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pS4kEajpHF \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 3, 2024\n\nWhile this news may initially seem alarming, Wedson reveals that address screenings indicate the asset movements were \u201csynchronized and rapid,\u201d suggesting these outflows might have been the strategic repositioning of reserves by Kraken itself, or part of an institutional strategy.\n\nAnticipating A Supply Squeeze And Price Surge\n\nMeanwhile, the timing of these movements is crucial, coming just as the market absorbs the impact of the SEC\u2019s recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThis regulatory nod has accelerated the reduction of ETH available on centralized exchanges, heightening anticipations of a possible supply squeeze that could positively influence Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe broader context involves a significant shift away from exchanges as the primary holders of crypto assets. Market analyst Ali noted a sharp decline in Ethereum held on exchanges, with about 777,000 ETH withdrawn post-ETF approval, hinting at an evolving market dynamic where major players might be moving towards greater self-custody amidst rising institutional involvement.\n\nThis trend is corroborated by a broader analysis of exchange balances, which shows a continuous decrease, suggesting a strengthening preference for holding cryptocurrencies outside exchange platforms.\n\nSuch movements are traditionally viewed as bullish indicators, implying reduced sell pressure and increased long-term holding behaviors among investors.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,777, following a peak of $3,850 in the last 24 hours. The current trading price represents a 0.7% increase in the past day despite a nearly 5% decline over the past week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently priced at $69,253, having pulled back from a 24-hour high of $70,188.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market witnessed a renewed recovery following the Bitcoin reversal from $56,000 in May. While a majority of major altcoins experienced a notable uptrend, Ethereum meme coins rallied with higher momentum as they are appealing to speculative traders. If you have missed the Pepe coin rally to its new all-time high, the top meme coins to buy are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Memecoin (MEME), and Floki (FLOKI) to capture similar trends.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Market Prediction: MVRV Ratio Hints Bitcoin Bull Run Has Room to Grow\n\nadvertisement\n\n1) Ethereum Meme Coin \u2013 Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-based cryptocurrency that started as a playful homage to Dogecoin. Key fundamental factors for SHIB include its significant social media presence, strategic token burns to reduce supply, and continuous development of its ecosystem.\n\nShiba Inu is one of the most promising Ethereum meme coin available today. In the daily chart, the SHIB price is steadily recovering under the influence of the ascending trendline. The dynamic support has uplifted the asset from its April 13th low at $0.0000183 to $0.000026, registering a growth of 45%.\n\nBy press time, the Shiba Inu price had a market cap of $14.7 billion, while the 24-hour trading volume dropped to $250 million.\n\nIf the support mentioned earlier is intact, the buyers could breach the swing high resistance of $0.00003. This breakout could offer better confirmation of market sentiment shifting from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThe post-breakout rally could push the asset to $0.000038, followed by $0.000054.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu\u2019s Shibarium Achieves Major Feat, Curtails Ethereum Bridge Time\n\n2) Floki\n\nFloki is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that has significantly evolved from its origins as a playful homage to Elon Musk\u2019s Shiba Inu dog. The core of Floki\u2019s ecosystem includes Valhalla, an NFT gaming metaverse that allows players to earn rewards through engaging activities like battles and asset trading.\n\nAmid the current market consolidation, the Floki price witnessed weakened bullish momentum, resulting in a reversal from $0.000313. This bearish turnaround plunged the meme coin 16% to trade at $0.0000259, while the market cap plunged to $2.44 Billion.\n\nIf the supply pressure increases, the coin price could tumble another 20% to seek support at the ascending trendline. This dynamic support has been carrying a bullish trajectory for nearly three months and can recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum in FLOKI.\n\nA potential rebound from this floor could push the asset beyond the $0.0000313 ceiling making it one of the best Ethereum meme coins to invest in.\n\nAlso Read: Coinbase Adds Shiba Inu, FLOKI, BONK In Full-Trading Mode, Prices To Recover?\n\n3) MAGA (Trump)\n\nMAGA Coin, also known as TRUMP, is a meme cryptocurrency inspired by the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump. The coin aims to merge political finance (PoliFi) with traditional cryptocurrency principles, targeting supporters of Trump and conservative causes.\n\nThe Trump coin entered an aggressive recovery rally from May\u2019s second week as the price rebounded from the $4.12 support. The reversal propelled the asset 256% to current trade at $14.7, while the market cap boasted to $637.4 Million.\n\nAmid this rally, the buyers recently gave a decisive breakout from the angular resistance trendline and $10.5 horizontal barrier. Sustaining this breakout should provide buyers with suitable support to lead a higher rally and target potential at $22, followed by $25.\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump Jail Discussions Unsettle Markets; Bitcoin Price Down 3%\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe current market recovery is particularly robust in the Meme coin sector, drawing in speculative traders eager for quick profits. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki, and MAGA (TRUMP) are notable Ethereum-based Meme coins demonstrating significant potential to drive a prolonged rally into 2024. These coins stand out due to their strong community support, innovative projects, and recent impressive market performances.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum has trended within a range in the past ten days.\n\nFutures traders continue to take long positions.\n\nAn analysis for Ethereum [ETH] price prediction showed that ETH has trended within a horizontal channel since it closed above $3650 on 20th May.\n\nA horizontal channel is formed when the price of an asset consolidates within a range for some time. This happens when there is a relative balance between buying and selling pressures, which prevents the asset\u2019s price from trending strongly in either direction.\n\nThe upper line of this channel forms resistance, while the lower line forms support. For ETH, it has formed resistance at $3962, while it finds support at $3638.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows bulls are here\n\nReadings observed from ETH\u2019s key momentum indicators confirmed that the market has been marked by equal amounts of buying and selling activity in the past few days.\n\nAlthough still positioned above the 50-neutral spot, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have been \u201cflat\u201d in the past few days.\n\nThese momentum indicators are said to be flat when they trend in a seemingly straight line, with no significant swings up or down.\n\nWhen they trend in this manner, it suggests that neither strong buying nor strong selling pressure exists. Traders interpret it to mean that there is no clear signal for a breakout upward or downward.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s RSI was 64.92, while its MFI was 63.74.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s declining Average True Range (ATR) confirmed the price consolidation. This indicator measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices over a specified number of periods.\n\nWhen the indicator falls, it suggests lower market volatility and hints that the asset\u2019s price is trending within a range without significant upward or downward movements.\n\nFutures traders are unmoved\n\nDespite ETH\u2019s sideways price movements in the past few days, its futures market activity has continued to grow. Since 20 May, the coin\u2019s futures open interest has increased by 42%.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s futures open interest surges like this, more traders are entering the market to open new trading positions. At press time, ETH\u2019s futures open interest was $16.45, per Coinglass\u2019 data.\n\nRegarding whether these traders are opening short or long positions, ETH\u2019s positive funding rate across cryptocurrency exchanges has remained positive. This shows that there has been more demand for long than short positions."

        "content": "Interest in Ethereum NFTs declined materially as sales plummeted over the past month.\n\nETH\u2019s price remained stable, but network growth continued to decline.\n\nEven though the price movement of Ethereum [ETH] was in a positive direction over the last few days, the ecosystem of Ethereum was facing some major problems.\n\nNFT volumes begin to fall\n\nOver the past month, the total sales of Ethereum NFTs fell by 55%. Popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club), MAYC (Mutant Ape Yacht Club) and Crypto Punks witnessed a significant decline of more than 40% in terms of sales and floor prices.\n\nNFTs on other networks such as Solana and Bitcoin were gaining traction compared to the Ethereum network.\n\nMoreover, the daily active addresses on the Ethereum network also fell significantly over the last few days along with the gas usage on the network, implying declining overall activity on the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis maybe a sign that Ethereum\u2019s popularity as an ecosystem was waning significantly.\n\nEven though the interest in ETH due to the hype around its ETF has risen and caused the price to grow, a waning interest in the Ethereum ETF\u2019s could cause a problem for ETH in the long run.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,786.76 and its price had fallen by 0.68%. The network growth around the ETH token had fallen significantly, implying that the number of new addresses interesting with ETH had drastically declined.\n\nA lack of interest from new addresses suggested that the market was not ready to buy ETH at its current price.\n\nSome bulls may wait for a correction before accumulating more ETH in the future.\n\nAdditionally, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had grown, indicating that the frequency with which ETH was trading at had risen.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the price action of ETH co relates with the rising velocity, giving bulls some hope about the future.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHow are addresses holding up?\n\nComing to the state of the holders, it was seen that most addresses were profitable, as indicated by the high MVRV ratio for ETH.\n\nEven though a high MVRV ratio means that more holders are incentivized to sell their holdings, the presence of long term holders showcased by the high Long/Short difference implies that a large sell-off may not happen anytime soon."

        "content": "Finder analyses expert price predictions each quarter. We surveyed 32 crypto industry specialists in July 2024 on their thoughts on how ether (ETH) would perform through 2030.\n\nAll prices mentioned in this report are denominated in US dollars.\n\nOn average, our panel thinks ether (ETH) will be worth $5,368 by the end of 2024 before rising to $7,359 by year-end 2025 and then $23,549 by 2030.\n\nEther (ETH) price predictions for 2024, 2025 and 2030\n\nETH's price is expected to rise to $5,368 by year-end 2024, according to the average prediction from Finder's panellists. This prediction is a little more bearish than their $5,710 prediction in the April report.\n\nThe panellists also predict ETH will hit $7,359 by 2025 and $23,549 by 2030. Both predictions are slightly more bearish than our panelists' average predictions from our April 2024 survey, when they projected ETH to reach $7,996 by 2024 and $29,380 by 2030.\n\nJosh Fraser, the cofounder of Origin Protocol, is one of our more bullish panel members on ETH's potential in 2024, predicting it will end the year worth $13,500 off the back of the incoming ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\"Ethereum ETF inflows have the potential to impact the price of ETH even more than bitcoin ETFs impacted the price of bitcoin (BTC). I anticipate ETH ETFs will be a major catalyst for both ETH and the broader industry and that ETF inflows will bring the price of ETH above $10,000 in the mid-term.\"\n\nJulian Hosp, CEO Cake Group, also references the incoming ETF as the reason he's so bullish on ETH, predicting it will be worth $10,000 in 2024.\n\nPedro Febrero, the VP of Web3 at Realfevr, is by far the most bullish on ETH's 2024 potential, predicting it will end the year worth $20,000, in part due to its use case.\n\n\"ETH is underpriced considering 90% of all cryptos protocols and devs use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It's the de facto world computer. Plus, the ETF will put ETH on a similar level to BTC for institutional buyers.\"\n\nShubham Munde, research team lead at Market Research Future, provided a prediction for ETH to end 2024 a touch over the panel average ($5,600). However, due to ETH's versatility, Munde says it could hit $9,000 at some point this year and has a bright future.\n\n\"Multiple use cases, large and active community, and smart contract functionality are some key factors I believe will raise the ETH prices sky high.\"\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, who sees the price of ETH falling to $2,700.\n\n\"ETH may perform better than other crypto in the short term as more Ethereum ETFs are listed. But in the medium term, all crypto (other than stablecoins) are a speculative bubble, and their prices are highly correlated.\"\n\nHow high and low will ether (ETH) go in 2024?\n\nOur panellists predict that ETH's average peak price in 2024 will be $6,050, with some predicting it will climb as high as $20,000.\n\nThe average lowest price our panelists predict ETH will hit in 2024 is $2,669, with some predicting it will fall as low as $1,500.\n\nClose to a quarter (23%) of our panelists feel that ETH's price will rise into the $5,000 to $5,999 range at its highest before the close of 2024, while a little over a quarter (19%) believe we'll see ETH's price within the $4,000 to $4,999 range within the same time frame.\n\nAround two-fifths of the panel (42%) think ETH's price bottom for the remainder of the year is somewhere between $2,000 and $2,500. An additional 35% say ETH's price will fall somewhere between $3,000 and $3,999 in 2024.\n\nMorty Tollo, the CEO of Elbaite, provided an above-average max price prediction for ETH ($8,000) as \"Ethereum ETF inflows have yet to start.\"\n\nDaniel Polotsky, the founder and chairman of CoinFlip is also quite bullish and thinks that ETH will hit $8K, citing market conditions, high-interest rates and the upcoming ETFs as reasons for his bullish stance.\n\n\"It seems like during periods of speculation and euphoria, risk assets like ETH outperform BTC. Since we are coming out of a period of high interest rates and entering a post-halving, lower-interest-rate phase, it is possible that a speculative bubble forms. This may help Ethereum even more so than bitcoin and cause a boom in its price. Ethereum will also be bolstered by Ethereum ETFs, which will begin trading shortly. Ethereum continues to provide scaling and restaking solutions but also has competitors such as Solana nipping at its heels. While it will likely survive this cycle as the top non-BTC dog, it cannot rest on its laurels if it wants to continue its reign as the number one alternative crypto asset.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy, hold or sell ether (ETH)?\n\nThe vast majority of the panel (64%) say it's time to buy, with a little under a third (29%) saying to hold and just 7% saying sell.\n\nNicole DeCicco, the CEO of CryptoConsultz, sees ETH as a strong buy based on its fundamentals.\n\n\"Ethereum's value is rooted in several key factors that continue to propel its price and ecosystem forward \u2026 Our positive outlook on Ethereum is underpinned by its technological advancements, growing adoption and the vibrant ecosystem it supports. We believe that Ethereum's strong fundamentals and continuous evolution will drive its value higher in the long term.\"\n\nMitesh Shah, the founder and CEO of Omnia Markets, also says that now is the time to buy ETH.\n\n\"Ethereum's current price may not fully reflect its long-term value due to its transition to a proof-of-stake model, which is expected to significantly reduce its energy consumption and increase transaction speed. Additionally, the growing adoption of DeFi applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum network indicates increasing demand for ETH. On-chain data also reveals a decrease in ETH supply on exchanges, suggesting strong investor confidence and a potential supply shortage, which could drive prices higher by the end of the year, similarly with BTC.\"\n\nPaul Levy, a senior lecturer at the University of Brighton, is in the \"hold\" camp and says that \"while Ethereum has the potential to grow significantly, possibly reaching $5,000 to $6,000 by the end of the year, it is also experiencing short-term negative signals and market volatility.\"\n\nIs ether (ETH) overpriced, underpriced or priced fairly?\n\nThe vast majority of our panellists feel that ETH is either underpriced or fairly priced.\n\nIn fact, 64% feel that ETH is currently underpriced, and 25% feel that it's priced fairly.\n\nOnly 11% feel that it's overpriced.\n\nMartin Froehler, the CEO of Morpher, says that ETH is undervalued since \"Ethereum will become the global settlement layer.\"\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, the CEO of Unocoin Technologies, says ETH's utility and ongoing development show that it is here to stay and fairly priced.\n\n\"Ethereum's price predictions are influenced by its ongoing development, including Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and its dominant position in the DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFT spaces. The current price reflects its utility and potential for growth as the backbone of decentralized applications. Market dynamics and increasing adoption by institutions and developers suggest that ETH is priced fairly and has strong long-term prospects.\"\n\nAjay Shrestha, a professor at Vancouver Island University, thinks that ETH is overpriced based on its inherent volatility:\n\n\"ETH could potentially reach new highs if it continues to be adopted for DeFi and other applications. But market volatility and external factors like regulatory changes can also influence its price.\"\n\nIs ETH going to be the BTC killer?\n\nAs to whether ETH could ever become a better store of value than BTC, the panel is evenly split, with 79% sitting in either the \"yes\" or \"no\" camp and the remainder unsure.\n\nBTC and ETH EFTs\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about combined BTC and ETH ETFs, and the vast majority (93%) think these will positively impact the price of ETH.\n\nDigging a little deeper, over half (54%) think combined BTC/ETH ETFs will have a significantly positive impact on the price of ETH, and 39% say it will have a moderately positive impact on ETH's value.\n\nMeet the panel\n\nNicole DeCicco + Read Nicole DeCicco's reasoning Nicole DeCicco + Read Nicole DeCicco's reasoning Prediction N/A Buy/sell/hold Buy shopping_basket Ethereum's price trajectory is influenced by a combination of technical advancements, market dynamics, and macroeconomic factors. While I tend to steer clear of hard and fast price predictions, Ethereum's value is rooted in several key factors that continue to propel its price and ecosystem forward. The anticipation and successful implementation of Ethereum 2.0- transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism- has not only impacted its valuation but does so by improving the network's scalability and security all while reducing its energy consumption. Ethereum's role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) through an ever-growing demand for Defi applications has driven the value of ETH to unprecedented levels. This utility enhances Ethereum's intrinsic value and supports a robust demand outlook. Ethereum's active development community and its innovative contributions have led to the successful launch of new features, such as Layer 2 scaling solutions, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform. The introduction of Ethereum ETFs is poised to have a significant impact on its price. These financial products provide traditional investors with easier access to Ethereum, broadening its appeal and increasing market liquidity. ETFs encourage more institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to ETH, driving demand and supporting higher price levels. Like other cryptocurrencies, it's important to consider broader market conditions. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, regulatory developments, and global economic trends play a significant role in shaping investor sentiment and market dynamics. The ongoing global economic uncertainty, inflation, and currency devaluations, along with the shift to a more digital economy, are additional factors likely to boost Ethereum's value. At CryptoConsultz, we leverage our deep understanding of the crypto landscape to provide nuanced insights and guidance. Our positive outlook on Ethereum is underpinned by its technological advancements, growing adoption, and the vibrant ecosystem it supports.

Our prediction of US$5,000 this year is primarily a result of the introduction of an Ethereum Spot ETF, which has potential to increase demand and as we anticipate institutional investors will accumulate and hold spot ETH long-term. Additionally, Ethereum's low inflation rate, and the potential for negative inflation when the network becomes congested, may also contribute to this price target.\n\nPaul Levy + Read Paul Levy's reasoning Paul Levy + Read Paul Levy's reasoning Prediction $4,200 Buy/sell/hold Hold back_hand While Ethereum has the potential to grow significantly, possibly reaching $5,000-$6,000 by the end of the year, it is also experiencing short-term negative signals and market volatility.\n\nMarkus Kraus + Read Markus Kraus's reasoning Markus Kraus + Read Markus Kraus's reasoning Prediction $3,300 Buy/sell/hold Hold back_hand 31 December 2024 (USD per ETH): $3,300 Current market trends and historical data indicate a moderate growth trajectory for Ethereum. The price predictions for 2024 reflect cautious optimism based on past performance and market sentiment. Technological advancements, including Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, will likely enhance its utility and adoption. Regulatory clarity and the deflationary mechanism from EIP-1559 will also support its value. 31 December 2025 (USD per ETH): $4,500 By 2025, Ethereum's broader integration into traditional financial systems and mainstream applications will likely boost its value. The continued interest of institutional investors and the growing acceptance of Ethereum ETFs will be significant drivers. Technological improvements and the deflationary aspects of Ethereum's tokenomics will reduce supply and potentially increase its value. Ethereum's role in DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain applications will also drive demand. 31 December 2030 (USD per ETH): $16,000 Looking ahead to 2030, Ethereum could become a cornerstone of the digital economy. Its extensive use in DeFi, NFTs, and other applications will solidify its position as a leading platform. Technological advances will make Ethereum more secure and efficient, attracting a larger user base. Global economic factors, like concerns about inflation, may drive more individuals and institutions to seek Ethereum as a store of value and a hedge against economic instability. Highest price (USD per ETH): $3,400 Ethereum could peak at $3,400 if technological advancements and market conditions are favorable. The ongoing improvements to the Ethereum network and its applications in DeFi and NFTs will support this growth. Positive market sentiment and increased adoption will be crucial. Lowest price (USD per ETH): $2,600 Ethereum might drop to $2,600 during market corrections. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market is always a factor. Potential regulatory challenges or economic downturns could affect prices.

Panellists can answer as many or as few questions as they like, meaning the number of responses received varies by question. 26 panelists gave their price prediction for ETH by year-end 2024, 2025 and 2030. Panelists may own some cryptocurrencies, including ETH. All prices are listed in USD per ETH.\n\nChanges to methodology: In 2021, this research was conducted using the simple mean of all answers supplied to Finder. From 2022, we switched to using the truncated mean, with the top and bottom 10% of responses removed to attain a more consistent result. Any 2021 results quoted in this analysis have also been re-calculated using the truncated mean.\n\nFinder analyses expert price predictions each quarter. We conducted our most recent survey in October 2023 in which our panel of 31 crypto industry specialists shared their thoughts on how Ether (ETH) would perform through 2030. All prices mentioned in this report are denominated in US dollars. On average, our panel thinks Ether (ETH) will be worth US$1,840 by 2023 before rising to US$5,824 by 2025 and then US$14,411 by 2030. Ether (ETH) price predictions for 2023, 2025 and 2030 ETH's price is expected to rise to US$1,840 by year-end 2023, according to the average prediction from Finder's panellists. This price prediction was down significantly from US$2,451, the average prediction for Ether's price by year-end 2023 from our July 2023 survey. The panellists also predict ETH will hit US$5,824 by 2025 and US$14,411 by 2030. Both of these predictions are lower than our panellists' average predictions in our July 2023 survey, which were US$5,845 by 2025 and US$16,414 by 2030. July 2023 report Price predictions\n\nHistorical Price Predictions \"ETH has a huge growth potential,\" Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, says. \"Growth is [currently] limited by high rates in TradFi. In [the] case of reaching a soft landing by US authorities, ETH['s] price will increase dramatically, but not until the middle of next year.\" Ben Ritchie, managing director at Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd, is also bullish on ETH and the Ethereum ecosystem on a longer time horizon, but feels we could see a lower price for ETH in the short term. \"The growing interest in Ethereum staking and [ETH's] exceptionally low inflation rate suggest the possibility of a short squeeze in the future, hinting at promising upside within the Ethereum ecosystem\" Ritchie says. \"[However,] we've adjusted our short-term Ethereum price forecast downward mainly because of potential economic challenges that could lead to a more cautious approach in the overall markets.\" Ryan Grace, head of tastycrypto, has a forecast similar to Ritchie's. \"Like BTC, Ethereum and broadly crypto as an asset class face macro headwinds that likely limit upside price action in the near-term,\" Grace says. \"With short-term rates at +5%, there's less incentive for capital flows into crypto.\" Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx, argues that ETH's price is currently low because it's simply following a pattern we've seen before. \"Historically, as we approach a Bitcoin halving, Ethereum tends to revisit its price valuations from earlier that year,\" Hundal says. \"This trend aligns with the repeated observation that Bitcoin's dominance (proportion of the total [crypto] market capitalisation) swells as we near the halving event. We can anticipate that there will be a potential shift from altcoins [like ETH] back into Bitcoin in the lead-up to the halving.\" How high and low will ETH go in 2023? The average peak price our panellists predict ETH will hit by year-end 2023 is US$1,932, with some predicting it will climb as high as US$2,800. The average lowest price our panellists predict ETH will hit by year-end 2023 is US$1,352, with some predicting it will fall as low as US$885. 45% of our panellists feel that ETH's price will rise into the $1,751\u2013$2,000 range before the close of 2023, while 69% think the lowest ETH's price will dip is into the $1,251\u2013$1,500 range. Highest projection\n\nLowest projection\n\n\"While Ethereum (ETH) is still likely to follow where Bitcoin (BTC) leads in terms of overall price trends, its intrinsic value and utility set it apart,\" Nick Ranga, senior cryptocurrency and forex analyst at ForexTraders.com, says. He thinks we'll see ETH at $2,250 before the year is out. \"Due to the wealth of use cases for the Ethereum network and the Ether cryptocurrency, it's future is assured.\"\n\nDamian Chmiel, senior analyst and editor at Finance Magnates, thinks we could see ETH's price as high as $2,000 before the year is out but also as low as $1,000.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect any significant movements in Ethereum for the rest of this year,\" Chmiel says. \"I anticipate it will consolidate between $2,000 and $1,000.\"\n\nDesmond Marshall, MD at Rouge International and Rouge Ventures, believes we could see ETH at $1,200 before the year is out, as he thinks regulatory uncertainty around the asset as well as macroeconomic factors may be holding its price down.\n\n\"The new ETH futures-linked ETFs were a major disappointment to the ETH supporters,\" Marshall says. \"As the regulatory confusion lurks, general retail investors and institutions are weary of jumping on the bandwagon too soon, esp[ecially] with a dwindling job market, employment stats, and a dipping stock market.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy, hold or sell ETH?\n\nAlmost half of our panellists (48%) believe it's a good time to hold ETH, while just over two-fifths of them (41%) believe it's time to buy ETH.\n\nOnly 10% think it's time to sell ETH.\n\n\"Ethereum has great intrinsic value,\" Natalja Zaharova, head of operations at FXOpen LP Ltd, says. \"Its network keeps becoming bigger.\"\n\nPaul Levy, senior lecturer at the University of Brighton, is also bullish on ETH and believes that now is the time to hold the asset.\n\n\"Ethereum is still much talked about, mostly for good reasons,\" Levy says. \"[It's] rooted in iterative innovation, often releasing new features and enhancements that are grounded in decent testing regimes.\"\n\nJeremy Britton, CFO of BostonTrading.co, also believes ETH is a hold, but he's somewhat bearish on ETH for technical reasons.\n\n\"Changing from POW to POS has made ETH less decentralised and less 'crypto',\" Britton says. \"Some of ETH's competitors may cut ETH's market share as people want lower fees and more decentralisation.\"\n\nAlexander Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FXPro, thinks it's time to sell ETH based on his technical analysis.\n\n\"Ethereum has tried to stay afloat above 50- and 200-week MAs,\" Kuptsikevich says. \"It went below them, and this move may continue in the following weeks.\"\n\nIs ETH overpriced, underpriced or priced fairly?\n\nThe vast majority of our panellists feel that ETH is either underpriced or fairly priced.\n\nThat is, 43% feel that ETH is currently underpriced and 40% feel that it's priced fairly.\n\nOnly 17% feel that it's overpriced.\n\n\"Ethereum will become the global settlement layer,\" Martin Froehler, CEO at Morpher, says. \"Ether is the first yield-bearing deflationary asset.\"\n\nTristan Thoma, director of government and payments at AlphaPoint, believes that ETH is priced fairly, pointing out that ETH's price will likely continue to increase as crypto becomes more widely adopted.\n\n\"The price is still likely to increase over time as [the] crypto user base grows globally with more confident compliance structures,\" Thoma says. \"[This should] result in [an] organic price increase.\"\n\nJohn Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, thinks ETH is overpriced, despite the uses of the Ethereum network.\n\n\"Ethereum has more uses, [than] Bitcoin,\" Hawkins says. \"[However,] the crypto mania is dying down; Google Trends show interest declining since 2021.\"\n\nHow will the Ethereum community respond to the \"over staking\" of ETH?\n\n41% of our panellists believe that the Ethereum community will not provide a significant response to the \"over staking\" of ETH.\n\nJust over a quarter of our panellists (26%) think the Ethereum community will propose curbing the influence of liquid staking protocols like Lido, while 22% believe the Ethereum community will respond by suggesting a cap of ETH deposits on the beacon chain.\n\nThe following is commentary from some of our panellists who voted \"Other\" in response to the question in the chart above.\n\nMatiu Rudolph, COO at Layer One X, points out that an Ethereum Improvement Protocol \u2013 EIP 7514 \u2013 \"has been proposed as a short term solution to slow down growth of the active validator set.\"\n\nJosh Fraser, co-founder of Origin Protocol, says \"the Ethereum community will come up with solutions to over staking, such as Origin Ether (OETH). Instead of just earning yield from staking rewards, users can find ways to optimise yield in innovative ways, such as optimising yield through DeFi and liquid staking.\"\n\nBen Ritchie, managing director of Digital Capital Management Pty Ltd, says \"In our perspective, we strongly advocate for the Ethereum community to prioritise thorough due diligence when selecting staking platforms, particularly those aligned with the principles of decentralisation, such as Rocketpool and similar projects aiming to promote network decentralisation.\"\n\nWhen will the tokenisation of real-world assets hit the mainstream?\n\n41% of our panellists think the tokenisation of real-world assets will go mainstream by 2030, while 31% believe we will see this by 2025.\n\nOnly 10% of our panellists think it will go mainstream by 2024 and 7% believe it will never go mainstream.\n\nJosh Fraser believes we'll see the tokenisation of real-world assets go mainstream by 2030.\n\n\"It's not unlikely that total value locked in NFTs will surpass that of DeFi,\" Fraser says, \"as NFT value will include real estate, IP, luxury goods, and beyond.\"\n\nWill the market cap of ETH flip that of BTC?\n\n43% of our panellists don't see ETH's market capitalisation ever flipping BTC's.\n\n23% think it will happen but not until 2030, while 20% are unsure.\n\nRuadhan O, creator of Seasonal Tokens, believes that Ethereum has more utility than Bitcoin, but that ETH won't flip BTC because ETH will be competing with the native coins of other smart contract platforms.\n\n\"Ethereum remains expensive to use [and] it will lose market share to cheaper alternatives,\" O says. \"Bitcoin isn't useful. Nobody needs a Bitcoin. There's no demand for Bitcoin's utility at a lower price, because there's no utility. This is why Bitcoin isn't losing market share to other proof-of-work coins.\"\n\nJosh Fraser feels differently and believes this will happen by 2030 or later.\n\n\"It's likely ETH will eventually flip Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization,\" Fraser says.\n\nMeet the panel\n\nMethodology\n\nFinder surveyed 31 fintech specialists in October 2023. Panellists are able to answer as many or as few questions as they like, meaning the number of responses received varies by question. 29 panellists gave their price prediction for ETH by year-end 2023, 2025 and 2030. Panellists may own some cryptocurrencies, including ETH. All prices are listed in USD per ETH.\n\nChanges to methodology: In 2021, this research was conducted using the simple mean of all answers supplied to Finder. From 2022, we switched to using the truncated mean, with the top and bottom 10% of responses removed in order to attain a more consistent result. Any 2021 results quoted in this analysis have also been re-calculated using the truncated mean.\n\nWas this content helpful to you? Yes No Thank you for your feedback!"

        "title": "777,000 Ethereum moved post-ETF approval: Impact on ETH? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price had dropped by over 2% in the last seven days\n\nA metric indicated that ETH was overvalued\n\nEthereum [ETH] created much buzz in the crypto space when the US Securities and Exchange Commission gave approval to ETH ETFs. Though ETH\u2019s price didn\u2019t turn bullish after the approval, things could change in the coming days.\n\nIs buying pressure high?\n\nBefore ETFs got approval, there was much anticipation and hype around it. During that time, ETH\u2019s price action also turned volatile in a northward direction.\n\nHowever, after the proposal was passed, things cooled down. In fact, Ethereum has struggled over the last few days.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 2% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, the king of altcoins was trading at $3,814.82 with a market capitalization of over $458 billion.\n\nIn the meantime, Ali, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting an interesting development.\n\nAs per the tweet, approximately 777,000 ETH, which was valued at about $3 billion, have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges since the ETF approval. This indicated high buying pressure, which might also have a positive impact on the token\u2019s price.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto analyzed its on-chain metrics to see whether buying pressure was actually high. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum\u2019s exchange outflow dropped last week.\n\nIts supply on exchanges increased, meaning that investors were rather selling ETH.\n\nOn top of that, the token\u2019s supply held by top addresses also dropped slightly last week. This meant that whales were also selling ETH as it struggled to touch $4k.\n\nLooking forward\n\nWhile selling pressure increased, a key metric turned bearish on the token. Our analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that Ethereum\u2019s NVT ratio registered a sharp uptick on the 1st of June.\n\nFor starters, the metric is computed by dividing the market cap by the transferred on-chain volume measured in USD.\n\nWhenever the metric rises, it indicates that an asset is overvalued. This suggested that the chances of a price correction were high.\n\nWe then analyzed Ethereum\u2019s daily chart to better understand which way it was headed. The technical indicator MACD displayed a bearish crossover, hinting at a price correction.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nNonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) had registered an uptick.\n\nMoreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also looked bullish, as it was well above the neutral mark. If these two indicators\u2019 data is to be considered, then there are chances of a price increase."

        "title": "Solana (SOL) vs. Ethereum (ETH): Which Blockchain Has Better Meme Coins? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "Investors in the cryptocurrency market are always on the lookout for high-reward opportunities, especially with meme coins. As the meme coin craze continues, the competition between Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) has intensified. This article explores which blockchain offers better meme coin investment opportunities.\n\nEthereum Meme Coins\n\nFor those seeking high leverage from Ethereum investments, established meme coins like SHIB, FLOKI, and PEPE are popular choices. Ethereum's robust DeFi ecosystem and recent bullishness from retail investors, particularly around the anticipated Ethereum ETF approval, have fueled a multi-month rally, making these coins attractive for high-risk, high-reward investments.\n\nSolana's Exceptional Rise\n\nSolana has seen a tremendous influx of capital over the past year, climbing the market cap ranks and even surpassing Binance\u2019s BNB Coin at times. Known for its speed, Solana boasts the highest transactions per second (TPS) among major blockchains, making it an appealing choice for many investors. Solana's rapid transaction speeds and lower costs contrast with Ethereum\u2019s slower, more secure network, which is preferred by institutions for its stability and higher cost deterrents against cyber exploits.\n\nSpeed vs. Security: Solana's Advantage\n\nRecent data highlight Solana's impressive performance, clocking 1,053 TPS, significantly higher than Ethereum. While Solana's speed and efficiency appeal to many, Ethereum's slower speeds and higher transaction costs are seen as beneficial for security and institutional adoption.\n\nInstitutional Interest in Solana and Ethereum\n\nInstitutional investment firms like Franklin Templeton and Ark Invest have shown strong interest in both Solana and Ethereum. Franklin Templeton has highlighted Solana as one of its top holdings, predicting accelerated adoption. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest, bolstered by potential regulatory approvals and high-profile endorsements.\n\nEmerging Meme Coins: Ethereum's Kai Cat Coin (KAI)\n\nFor investors looking for undiscovered meme coins with high potential, Ethereum's new Kai Cat Coin (KAI) is gaining attention. Currently in presale at $0.0042 per token, KAI has been featured in prominent publications like CoinPedia and Blockchain Today, making it a noteworthy candidate for those seeking the next big meme coin.\n\nBluechip Blockchain Investments\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum are considered blue chip blockchain assets, offering promising investment opportunities. While Ethereum remains the leader in DeFi with strong institutional backing, Solana's speed and efficiency make it a formidable contender. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals when choosing between these two networks. For those willing to take higher risks for potentially higher rewards, emerging meme coins like Ethereum's Kai Cat Coin offer exciting possibilities."
