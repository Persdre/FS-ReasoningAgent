        "content": "The listing represents a preliminary step in the trading process, yet it does not ensure that the SEC will grant approval for the fund.\n\nShare this article\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF has appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation\u2019s (DTCC) new securities list with the ticker EZET. This development occurred just a day following reports of the SEC\u2019s probable rejection of spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe DTCC listing represents a preliminary step in the trading process, yet it does not ensure that the SEC will approve the Ether Spot ETF. The SEC\u2019s decision on the fund remains pending.\n\nFranklin Templeton filed for spot Ethereum ETF in February, joining other industry giants like BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK Invest, in the race. However, the outlook for Ethereum-based funds is not as promising as it was for Bitcoin-based predecessors.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates there is only a 25% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. He cites a noticeable absence of engagement from the SEC, contrasting with the Bitcoin ETF approval process. Balchunas interprets this silence as a deliberate \u2018tactical\u2019 decision rather than mere \u2018procrastination.\u2019\n\nJPMorgan analysts anticipate a protracted delay in the regulatory approval of the spot Ethereum ETF, though they suggest that approval could eventually follow a legal challenge similar to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit, which compelled the SEC to reassess spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s market performance has stagnated post-Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving, with its price staying between $3,100 and $3,200, according to CoinGecko. At press time, Ethereum is trading at around $3,100, down 1% in 24 hours."

        "content": "Crypto stalwart joins industry offensive regulator moves to legally define Ethereum.\n\nSEC signalled it is poised to make a move on MetaMask.\n\nStaking is new front in legal war between DeFi and Washington.\n\nConsensys has joined the anti-SEC brigade.\n\nOn Thursday, Consensys, the company behind the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly waging a \u201ccampaign to seize control over the future of cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe firm, which is led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, has locked arms with Coinbase, Greyscale, and the Blockchain Association in the vanguard of crypto industry stalwarts that have challenged the agency\u2019s three-year campaign to clamp down on digital assets.\n\nIn the process, Consensys hopes to protect its own position and one of its crown jewels \u2014 MetaMask, a wallet provider with 30 million users.\n\nAd hoc enforcement\n\nConsensys alleged the SEC is unlawfully deploying \u201cad hoc enforcement actions against Consensys and others.\u201d\n\nIn its lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas, Consensys said the SEC is trying to legally define Ethereum as a security.\n\nThe move alarms industry players because it would force projects to register Ethereum-linked tokens the same way traditional firms do with stocks and bonds.\n\nFor the crypto community, this is anathema because they consider blockchain-based assets as a separate class that deserves its own statutory regime, and rules and regulations. This idea is at the heart of Coinbase\u2019s defence against a lawsuit brought last year by the SEC.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys,\u201d read the complaint.\n\nNew front\n\nStaking has opened a new front in the battle between the SEC and the industry since Ethereum switched to a Proof of Stake consensus method for maintaining its blockchain in 2022.\n\nThe SEC has been on a warpath to define Ethereum as a security ever since the network introduced staking that year.\n\nStaking refers to earning rewards from a blockchain network by locking up a cryptocurrency to support the network\u2019s validating nodes.\n\nA person familiar with the case explained that the crypto company had considered several options before moving to file.\n\nCertain elements of the SEC\u2019s investigation into the Ethereum protocol compelled Consensys to defend itself and the ecosystem before the Commission did any real damage, the person said.\n\nConsensys\u2019 complaint came after the SEC notified it was preparing to sue the firm over MetaMask, one of the industry\u2019s most widely used crypto wallets.\n\nThe SEC alleged in its notification that given MetaMask\u2019s \u201cswap\u201d and \u201cstake\u201d features, which let users trade cryptocurrencies and earn rewards on their holdings, Consensys is operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer, according to the filing.\n\n\u2018Ethereum is not a security\u2019\n\nConsensys says the non-custodial wallet is akin to a web browser rather than a trading platform like an exchange.\n\n\u201cAny investigation or enforcement action premised on Consensys operating as a \u2018broker\u2019 under the Exchange Act through its MetaMask wallet software would exceed the SEC\u2019s authority,\u201d said the complaint.\n\nThe crypto firm is asking the court to find that Ethereum is not a security, a move that would ripple across the industry.\n\nThat\u2019s because the SEC has made a series of legal attacks against some of the biggest firms in the industry.\n\nCoinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange, and the SEC are locking horns after the commission alleged that Coinbase is also operating as an unlicensed broker and exchange.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC notified Uniswap, crypto\u2019s largest decentralised exchange platform, that it was operating as an unlicensed broker.\n\nNow, the SEC appears to be turning to peer-to-peer protocols and applications.\n\nLiam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent.

        "title": "Metamask wallet developer Consensys files lawsuit over SEC\u2019s claims that ETH is a security - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Yesterday blockchain development firm Consensys filed a Texas lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Commissioners, arguing that the SEC is unlawfully claiming that Ethereum\u2019s ETH token is a security. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction preventing the SEC from taking legal action against MetaMask, Consensys\u2019 popular cryptocurrency wallet with more than 30 million monthly active users.\n\nSome redacted parts of the text are worth exploring as they could imply that the SEC has issued some confidential ruling or internal guideline that ETH is a security. Apart from the redactions, the lawsuit explicitly states, \u201cThe SEC\u2019s investigation into transactions in ETH is predicated on a determination that ETH is a security.\u201d\n\nFounded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, ConsenSys is backed by numerous traditional finance (TradFi) firms. These include HSBC, JP Morgan, Mastercard, Microsoft, Softbank and UBS.\n\nMetaMask wallet\n\nConsensys was first informed about the SEC\u2019s interest in MetaMask in April 2022 and has provided considerable information since then. On April 10 Consensys received an SEC \u201cWells Notice\u201d warning of an imminent enforcement action. This was on the grounds that the SEC believes the MetaMask Swaps and Staking services violate federal security laws because Consensys is not a broker dealer.\n\nConsensys argues it is simply providing a user interface enabling access to other services such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and staking protocols. The SEC has also sent a Wells Notice to Uniswap, the leading DEX.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a different jurisdiction, Europe\u2019s latest anti money laundering (AML) legislation imposes requirements on crypto asset service providers, but explicitly excludes self-hosted wallet providers such as MetaMask.\n\nDid proof of stake make ETH a security?\n\nBack in 2018 there was much debate about whether or not ETH was a security. One lawyer in the crypto space raised questions about the patterns in the ETH ICO and concluded it probably was*. However, just a few months later, SEC Director William Henman delivered a high profile speech in which he said ETH was a commodity.\n\nConsensys is understandably unhappy that the SEC has flip flopped on this position. However, since then Ethereum has changed by moving from proof of work to proof of stake (the Ethereum Merge). This involves validators locking up cryptocurrency and earning a return in exchange for helping to secure the blockchain. Based on this, the SEC also targeted Consensys\u2019 sales of ETH from its treasury and asked why Consensys considers these are not sales of securities. Additionally, Consensys received three subpoenas relating to the Ethereum Merge.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only one that relied on the ETH being a commodity. The CFTC continues to say ETH is a commodity. As a result TradFi crypto players such as EDX Markets \u2013 founded by Fidelity, Citadel Securities and others \u2013 only trade Bitcoin, ETH and Litecoin. No license is required for spot trading of commodities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the redactions?\n\nConsensys\u2019 statement that the SEC has taken the position that ETH is a security, combined with redactions in the text, indicates that the SEC\u2019s stance appears to have formally changed.\n\nHere\u2019s one redaction: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s self-aggrandizing about-face on ETH is notable for its lack of transparency. In April 2023, Gary Gensler, the Biden Administration\u2019s crusading SEC Chair, appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. The Committee Chairman repeatedly asked Gensler: does the SEC now think ETH is a security? Gensler refused to answer this direct question from the Chairman of the Congressional committee charged with overseeing his agency. He did not want to admit that his SEC had already secretly cemented its power-grab by issuing an <redacted>.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the text it states, \u201cETH is not a security under the Securities Act, and therefore <redacted> exceeds the SEC\u2019s statutory authority.\u201d\n\nOn the basis of the first redaction, we quizzed ChatGPT to see if it could fill in any blanks. The suggestions it came up with were :\n\ninternal memorandum\n\ndirective to staff\n\nconfidential ruling\n\nclosed-door decision\n\nclassification guideline\n\nenforcement action plan\n\npreliminary determination.\n\nIf, as Consensys implies, the SEC had already made some internal finding that ETH is a security, then given this is an about face, they should publicize it sooner rather than later. That said, Gensler has stated that proof of stake tokens should be regulated as securities for over a year.\n\nWhat about an ETH ETF?\n\nThe crypto markets seem rather sanguine about the latest news of SEC\u2019s position, perhaps because it\u2019s already built in. ETH is up 1% during the past 24 hours. However, the SEC is also expected to approve an ETH ETF. If the SEC believes that ETH primarily trades on unauthorized exchanges, could this serve as grounds for rejecting the ETF? This reasoning differs from the grounds it used to reject previous Bitcoin ETFs, which courts threw out last year. Bitcoin is definitely a commodity, so its spot markets do not need to register.\n\n* in response to the ICO blog post, high profile crypto techie Hasu penned another."

The investment will fuel the development of Movement L2, a cutting-edge layer-2 blockchain that promises enhanced security and efficiency for Ethereum transactions.\n\nThis initiative leverages the Move programming paradigm, initially developed by Facebook, to offer a robust alternative to traditional blockchain environments.\n\nFounders Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, young visionaries and former Vanderbilt students, are at the forefront of this innovative venture. They aim to integrate the Move Virtual Machine into Ethereum\u2019s expansive ecosystem. This move is anticipated to reduce transaction costs while boosting transaction processing speeds.\n\ngmove.\n\n\n\nemotional day for us at movement labs across all verticals as we announce our $38M series A,\n\n\n\nbefore we get into it, i want to talk a bit about where we came from 1/ \u2014 rushi (@rushimanche) April 25, 2024\n\nAddressing Industry Challenges\n\nThe drive for adopting Move stemmed from the persistent security challenges within the blockchain sector. Historical data reveals that between 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts to siphon off approximately $5.4 billion across various protocols.\n\nMovement Labs\u2019 new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is designed to mitigate such risks by allowing developers to deploy verified code, preventing prevalent attack vectors like reentrancy attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the Move programming language incorporates techniques such as parallelization to manage multiple transaction streams effectively. This feature fortifies the network against potential security threats.\n\nThe funding round drew support from multiple venture capital firms, indicating strong confidence in Movement Labs\u2019 approach to blockchain security. Participants included notable names like Hack VC, Placeholder, and Aptos Labs. These partnerships underscore a collective commitment to advancing secure and efficient blockchain technology.\n\nMovement Labs is poised to launch the testnet phase of Movement L2 this summer, marking a milestone in their journey towards a decentralized and secure blockchain infrastructure. The introduction of the Move Stack and a shared sequencer further illustrates the company\u2019s dedication to innovation and scalability in blockchain technology.\n\nBy prioritizing decentralization from the outset, Movement Labs sets a new standard for layer-2 networks. This strategic direction enhances Ethereum\u2019s security and functionality and supports the broader adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors."

If approved, SnowBridge is slated to go live in 28 days.\n\nWhat is SnowBridge?\n\nSnowBridge is one of the many bridges under development within the Polkadot ecosystem. This initiative, a collaboration between Snowfork and Parity Technologies, aims to revolutionize the movement of Ethereum assets into and out of Polkadot.\n\nCurrently, bridging ERC-20 tokens into Polkadot necessitates using bridges reliant on third-party signatures. While this method is standard in Web3 ecosystems, it poses limitations for Parachains and dApps on Polkadot due to its impact on their trust model.\n\nSnowBridge offers a solution through a trustless model that relies solely on signatures from first-party Ethereum and Polkadot validators. It operates on BridgeHub and is poised to enhance cross-chain interaction between Polkadot and Ethereum.\n\nSnowBridge has been in development for some time and was deployed on the Polkadot parachain testnet Rococo in January 2024. Subsequently, developers utilized it to transfer assets between the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and AssetHub on Rococo, with ERC-20 tokens initially being the sole supported asset type.\n\nSince its deployment, several updates to SnowBridge have been implemented based on thorough testing and audits conducted by the team and security firms.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

Consensys also claims that Ether \u2013 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform \u2013 is a commodity and not a security.\n\nThe blockchain company claims apps that allow people to make transactions using Ethereum are not securities brokers and \u201ctherefore cannot be regulated by the SEC\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to expand its regulatory purview, the SEC would effectively destroy value for hundreds of millions of ether holders and bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling the technological evolution of the internet,\u201d the company claims.\n\nThe complaint wants a court to agree with Consensys\u2019 claims that the SEC has no legal authority to regulate ether, software interfaces built on Ethereum or \u201cthe Ethereum blockchain in general\u201d. This complaint has been filed in a US district court in Texas.\n\nThe SEC did not respond to a request for comment from Coindesk on the new Consensys lawsuit.\n\nCrypto crackdown\n\nThe SEC has been cracking down on various crypto trading platforms in the US in recent years. The US agency claims that digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are subject to US securities laws because they are investment contracts. Critics of the SEC claim there the regulations around digital assets in the US are unclear.\n\nLast year, the SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance, claiming the crypto exchanges had acted unlawfully in the country. Towards the end of 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao plead guilty to US charges and the crypto exchange agreed to pay more than $4bn to resolve an investigation.\n\nLast month, the SEC scored a victory in its lawsuit against Coinbase, when a judge ruled that its claim that the cryptocurrency exchange engaged in unregistered sales of securities could be heard by a jury at trial.\n\nThe SEC is facing a hit from recent criticisms, however. Last week, two SEC lawyers resigned after a US judge sanctioned the regulator for \u201cgross abuse\u201d of power in a crypto case, Bloomberg reports.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

This is the situation SEC Chair Gary Gensler now finds himself in as he seeks to exert jurisdiction over Ethereum, which many feel slipped away from the agency\u2019s purview years ago.\n\nThe second-biggest blockchain, which went live a decade ago, is largely decentralized. When a small group of people arranged to issue tokens for sale shortly after its launch, the SEC could have made a plausible case Ethereum was a securities offering. But that ship has long since sailed, so Gensler is trying the regulatory version of a bank shot.\n\nThis has become apparent in the SEC\u2019s recent efforts to go after those engaged in staking, a process that Ethereum implemented in late 2022, and that replaced energy-intensive mining with a new model for verifying transactions on the blockchain. That model entails trusted nodes called validators, which receive modest rewards for updating the chain, and that require people to post collateral to ensure they are behaving honestly. If they try anything funny, they get \u201cslashed\u201d and lose that collateral.\n\nIt\u2019s a clever model that serves to maintain the blockchain in an energy-efficient manner and has worked well as Ethereum has continued to attract new projects and developers around the world. It\u2019s just how Ethereum works. Under Gensler, however, the SEC\u2019s lawyers have attempted to seize on staking as proof the blockchain\u2019s tokens are securities in order to try to stuff the Ethereum toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nI don\u2019t really get it. If you squint, I suppose you can look at the validators who secure the blockchain\u2014and offer to stake tokens on behalf of smaller Ethereum holders in return for a cut of the reward\u2014as engaged in some sort of issuance of securities. But it doesn\u2019t make sense in the broader context of Ethereum, which is a sprawling decentralized project with no single group of people in charge of it. It makes even less sense to imagine how Ethereum was not a security in 2018\u2014Gensler said so himself at the time\u2014but that now it is.\n\nIn any case, his legal theory will soon be put to the test as crypto giant Consensys yesterday sued the SEC to fend off the agency\u2019s attempt to regulate the staking service offered by its MetaMask wallet. The company is not only asking the court to force the SEC to stay away from MetaMask but to leave all Ethereum projects in peace once and for all. This doesn\u2019t mean Consensys is saying those who make money on staking should pay no tax\u2014that\u2019s an issue for the IRS\u2014but rather that the SEC has no legal authority to touch Ethereum in the first place.\n\nThese sorts of things are unpredictable but, at first glance, it\u2019s hard to see how the SEC wins in court. Perhaps Gensler is very good at pool and thinks he can make the legal version of a tough bank shot. Or maybe he\u2019s just taking a shot and relying on blind luck that it will work.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nPayment giant Stripe is accepting USDC, the first time it has processed crypto since 2018 when it ceased taking Bitcoin because it was \u201cunstable.\u201d (TechCrunch)\n\nNew funds stopped pouring into BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF on Wednesday, ending a 71-day streak of inflows.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto industry heavyweights are lending their support to Consensys after the Ethereum giant launched a preemptive strike against the SEC on Thursday.\n\nConsensys, the company behind the MetaMask crypto wallet, filed a lawsuit against the SEC, alleging the regulator is trying to \"seize control over the future of cryptocurrency\" and is overreaching in its attempts to regulate Ethereum. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) The company claims the SEC plans to regulate Ethereum as a security\u2014which, up to now, the regulator has yet to state publicly.\n\n\u201cThanks [to the founder of Consensys and the rest of the team] for fighting back and defending our industry,\u201d Uniswap founder and CEO tweeted yesterday. \u201cWe're tired of the overreach and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has a long and contentious relationship with the crypto industry, filing multiple lawsuits against industry leaders such as Binance, Kraken, Uniswap, and Coinbase. So this reversing of the tables was welcomed with open arms by figures in the space who took to Crypto Twitter to express their delight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSue the Exchange Commission Thanks @ethereumJoseph and @Consensys for fighting back and defending our industry We're tired of the overreach and harassment https://t.co/yDTjjiaJWl pic.twitter.com/vtWxqKxv9n \u2014 hayden.eth \ud83e\udd84 (@haydenzadams) April 25, 2024\n\nThe SEC hit Uniswap with a Wells notice earlier this month, alleging the decentralized exchange had broken securities laws. A Wells notice is a letter that the SEC sends to individuals or companies to inform them it plans to take enforcement action and file a lawsuit.\n\nIn its own lawsuit against the regulator, Consensys revealed that it too had received a Wells notice from the SEC after a years-long investigation into Ethereum, the network's transition to proof of stake following the merge, and the Metamask crypto wallet, specifically.\n\nConsensys's preemptive lawsuit seeks to get a court to agree that Ethereum is not a security, thereby nullifying the SEC's claims. It's a move others in the industry have attempted recently as well, including Coinbase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe San Francisco-based crypto exchange is currently tied up in legal battles with the SEC regarding the alleged sale of unregistered securities. In the wake of the Consensys announcement, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal took to Twitter to express his thoughts.\n\nI know ETH is a commodity. You know ETH is a commodity. The CFTC knows ETH is a commodity. It's time for the SEC to admit that it still knows ETH is a commodity too. No more games. Thank you to @Consensys for standing up against the SEC's unlawful expansion of authority. https://t.co/8w7A4PBwUK \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2024\n\n\u201cIt's time for the SEC to admit that it still knows ETH is a commodity too. No more games.\u201d Grewal said, \u201cThank you to Consensys for standing up against the SEC's unlawful expansion of authority.\u201d\n\nNeither Binance nor Kraken\u2014both still fighting their own SEC court battles\u2014immediately responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "The Ethereum network has undergone notable changes in recent times. On September 15, 2022, the network transitioned from a proof-of-work mining model to a proof-of-stake model. This transition has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption, with reports indicating a 99.95% decrease.\n\nA few days ago, the network implemented the Dencun upgrade, which was designed to improve its functionality and performance. However, following this upgrade, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline, falling below the $4,000 mark.\n\nETH had recently shown growth, rising by 4.8% in the last seven days. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,150, according to CoinGecko data. ETH is up by 68.5% year-to-date and has regained the $3,100 level recently.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Makes Crucial Shibarium Announcement: Can SHIB Hit $0.0001 In May?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction for May\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for May. According to their analysis, ETH is expected to reach a minimum price of $3,271 and a maximum price of $3,399. The average price is expected to be $3,335.\n\nThe prediction reveals that ETH is unlikely to hit the $4,000 level by May. The recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has been largely attributed to the pump after the recent BTC retrace. With Bitcoin once again showing heightened volatility, the trajectory of ETH remains uncertain.\n\nAlso read: Dogwifhat: Can WIF Hit $10 In May?\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin hit a multi-year low in April.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that the gap between the two could become more pronounced.\n\nInvestors are losing their faith in Ethereum as the cryptocurrency continuously fails to keep pace with Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains.\n\nAnd things could get worse for the world\u2019s biggest altcoin.\n\nNot only have the odds for a US spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund getting approved in May dropped, but Ethereum exchange-traded products suffered $34 million worth of outflows this past week, CoinShares data shows \u2014 making them the only asset group among those CoinShares tracks to register a net outflow since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cETH sentiment is anecdotally at the lowest it has been in years, despite recent developments such as the BUIDL fund by BlackRock,\u201d Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, told DL News.\n\nThe decreasing optimism comes as smaller altcoins, like Solana, have attracted investors who don\u2019t expect Ethereum investments to yield as high returns as they did in the past.\n\nA Bitcoin-driven market\n\nIn previous bull markets, Bitcoin has outperformed other cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the cycle \u2014 a trend that looks to be playing out again.\n\nThis time the focus on Bitcoin has been catalysed by inflows to the 10 US Bitcoin ETFs that launched on January 11.\n\nThey have so far seen over $12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nYet, Ethereum has not managed to capitalise on the rally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin \u2014 or ETHBTC \u2014 fell to a low of 0.046 in April, creating the biggest price gap between the two assets in almost three years.\n\nThat means that since ETHBTC peaked in 2022, an investment in Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum by 44%.\n\nThe ETHBTC trading pair shows the price of Ethereum divided by the price of Bitcoin. Traders use this metric to gauge the relative strength of Ethereum against benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEven though some people may not view ETH as an altcoin per se, its over- or underperformance relative to Bitcoin is a powerful metric to try and understand what kind of market we are in,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs continue to steam ahead, the price gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more pronounced.\n\nAnd there\u2019s reason to believe that Bitcoin ETF inflows will continue to soar. Hong Kong recently approved the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which are set to begin trading April 30.\n\nEthereum ETF approval looks unlikely\n\nWhile Hong Kong also approved a spot Ethereum ETF, the odds of US regulators approving similar funds on May 23 \u2014 the deadline for when they have to either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s application \u2014 are low.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put odds for a May approval at around 25%.\n\nSimilarly, punters on blockchain-based betting platform Polymarket put the odds of an approval at 13%.\n\nThis week, BlackRock amended its spot Ethereum ETF application while competitor Grayscale filed to convert its futures Ethereum ETF to a spot fund.\n\nDespite this, analysts remain sceptical that any US spot Ethereum ETF will be approved.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETF is almost certainly going to be rejected in May, which has dampened flows into ETH in already existing [exchange-traded] products,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSolana steals the spotlight\n\nAmong so-called altcoins, Ethereum is the largest, with a market value of $384 billion. But this success is a double-edged sword, according to Nolan.\n\n\u201cETH has a large market cap and investors have turned to lower cap alternatives,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nOne popular alternative is Solana.\n\nMost traders assume it would be difficult for Ethereum\u2019s market value to exceed that of Bitcoin. So with Bitcoin sporting a market value of $1.27 trillion, Ethereum traders see limited upside potential.\n\nDespite rallying 546% over the past year, Solana\u2019s market cap is a comparatively low $64 billion, leaving more room for it to grow.\n\nTraders are also starting to pay more attention to Solana\u2019s price compared with other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI have noticed much more attention this cycle vs. last cycle to SOL/ETH and SOL/BTC pairs,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSigns of hope\n\nThere\u2019s still hope Ethereum could stop bleeding against Bitcoin \u2014 but not for a while.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF should help drive interest. Nolan said he expects an ETF will \u201clikely\u201d be approved in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, if the current bull market repeats previous ones, Ethereum should do better as time goes on.\n\nUntil then, traders will continue to watch the ETHBTC chart closely for clues as to where the top two cryptocurrencies are heading next.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Moreover, he alleged that it has operated as a security since its initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nEx-Ethereum Advisor Reacts To Consensys Vs SEC Lawsuit\n\nNerayoff\u2019s affirmation comes amidst an ongoing legal battle between Joseph Lubin\u2019s Consensys and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, filed by Consensys, aims to prevent Ethereum from being declared a security. The former Ethereum advisor labeled it as a move to \u201ccover up\u201d prior collusion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn one of his posts, Nerayoff declared, \u201cIt\u2019s an undeniable fact that Ethereum is centralized and has been a security since the ICO. This move is to distract people from the truth and just another cover-up.\u201d Moreover, he further accused Ethereum of engaging in \u201cmajor securities fraud\u201d through speculative ICO purchases and undisclosed whale holdings.\n\nFurthermore, the former advisor also spotlighted key figures within Ethereum\u2019s leadership, including Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin, alleging their involvement in fraudulent activities. Nerayoff pointed to Lubin\u2019s significant purchases during the ICO as evidence of securities fraud, a claim supported by SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s assertion that Lubin acquired 9.5% of the ICO.\n\nIn addition, Nerayoff alleged collusion between Ethereum and the SEC. He cited a meeting between Lubin and former SEC official Bill Hinman prior to the latter\u2019s speech declaring Ethereum not a security.

He suggested a broader conspiracy to monopolize the crypto market. Additionally, he accused the SEC of biased treatment towards Ripple while targeting Ethereum\u2019s only competition, echoing sentiments from the XRP community.\n\n\u201cThe XRP case has exposed the collusion between the SEC, FBI, DOJ, and other big entities to monopolize the crypto market,\u201d Nerayoff asserted. Furthermore, he called for Ripple to be exonerated and Ethereum to be held accountable for its alleged misconduct.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s allegations have reignited scrutiny over Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market shines a spotlight on several Ethereum meme coins to buy that are currently valued under one dollar. Notable among these are Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). Each of these digital currencies has seen impressive gains recently, attracting the interest of investors aiming for significant returns. Their growing popularity may suggest they are viable options for turning a small investment into considerable profits in the volatile crypto market.\n\n1. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe (PEPE), a new cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, is swiftly gaining traction. It aims to match or surpass the success of iconic meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Currently holding the 35th spot in market rankings, Pepe coin boasts a market cap of $3.22 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEnhanced support from platforms like Coinbase and significant acquisitions by large-scale investors have propelled its visibility and value. Market trends and a rise in similar meme coins also contribute to Pepe bullish momentum.\n\nPresently, the Pepe price is $0.000007638, marking a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. This recent surge has positioned it as today\u2019s most popular meme coin on CoinMarketCap. Over the last week, it has witnessed a substantial 47% increase. Over the past 12 months, PEPE value has skyrocketed by 3368%, highlighting it as a potential investment for significant returns this weekend.\n\n2. Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB) continues to flourish within the decentralized finance realm. As another Ethereum-based digital asset, it has recently seen a 3% rise in its value. The current price of Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002577, suggesting continued growth. With a 146% increase over the past year, SHIB remains a strong contender in the market.\n\nRanked 11th by CoinMarketCap, SHIB has a market capitalization of $15.18 billion. Factors such as enhanced trading volume, strategic token burns, and the introduction of Shibairum are driving its upward trajectory. This makes SHIB another attractive meme coin for potential investors looking for substantial gains.\n\n3.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Supply on Exchanges increased in the last few days.\n\nETH was down by over 2%, and indicators looked bearish.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has witnessed a considerable amount of outflow from exchanges over the last week. This happened while its price action was bullish.\n\nHowever, the market turned bearish in the last 24 hours. Did this have a negative impact on ETH\u2019s outflow?\n\nEthereum\u2019s outflow surged!\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rested comfortably above the $3k mark as its price rallied by more than 6% in the last seven days.\n\nWhile that happened, investors stockpiled ETH, hinting that they expected the token\u2019s price to rise further in the coming days.\n\nTitan of Crypto, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting this fact.\n\nAs per the tweet, crypto exchanges witnessed an outflow of over 260,000 ETH, equivalent to more than $781 million, within the past seven days.\n\nAdditionally, Justin Sun also accumulated ETH. As per a recent tweet from Lookonchain, a wallet that possibly belongs to Sun withdrew 15,389 ETH, worth $49.78 million, from Binance again.\n\nThe wallet earlier had bought 147,442 ETH, worth $469.9 million at $3,179 since the 8th of April.\n\nHowever, the last 24 hours witnessed a change in market sentiment as most cryptos\u2019 prices dropped. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by over 2%.\n\nAt press time, the king of altcoins was trading at $3,165.53 with a market capitalization of over $386 billion.\n\nIs ETH\u2019s price drop affecting buying pressure?\n\nSince the token\u2019s price dropped, AMBCrypto checked its metrics to find whether this had any impact on buying pressure.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven days\u2019 average. This signaled that investors have started to sell ETH.\n\nThe token\u2019s exchange outflow declined in the last few days. Additionally, the fact that investors were selling Ethereum was further proven by its supply-on-exchange graph as it went up.\n\nNotably, the price decline didn\u2019t affect whale accumulation. This seemed to be the case as ETH\u2019s supply held by top addresses continued to rise last week.\n\nGoing forward\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s derivatives metrics and technical indicators to see if the rise in selling pressure could further impact its price. The token\u2019s Funding Rate increased.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nGenerally, prices tend to move the other way than the Funding Rate. This movement suggested a continued price drop for ETH.\n\nTechnical indicators also looked bearish. For instance, both ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Money Flow Index (MFI) started to decline, showing a continued price drop in the coming days."

This week, heavy selling of BTC options has seen the vol curve collapse, with Bitcoin vols further compressing from 70% to 50%.

Increasing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to trader impatience could actually benefit non-Bitcoin assets.\n\nThere has already been a notable increase in bearish sentiments among traders, as most assets have retraced considerably since Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high on 14th April. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood of relief bounces occurring in the next week.\n\nWhile a softened stance or a surprise approval could initially boost Ethereum\u2019s value, overly eager traders\u2019 fear of missing out may lead to a mid-term drop, providing opportunities for large holders to lower prices.\n\nRegardless, if mainstream sentiment is selling the rumor, there historically tends to be a justification for buying the news.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for ETH?\n\nAt press time ETH was trading at $3,151.30 and its price had fallen by 0.35% in the last 24 hours. The volume at which it was trading at had also fallen by 4.04% during the same period.\n\nThe network growth had moved sideways over the last few days, implying that new addresses weren\u2019t particularly showing interest in ETH at the time of writing.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe velocity at which ETH was trading was also moving sideways indicating that the frequency at which ETH was being traded at had remained stagnant.\n\nThe network growth and velocity moving sideways suggest that there may not be any significant fluctuations in price in the near short term for ETH."

However, Solana\u2019s NFT metrics started to decline in the past month. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish.\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT ecosystem is shining bright\n\nSolanaFloor, a popular X handle that posts updates related to the blockchain, posted a tweet highlighting SOL\u2019s commendable performance.\n\nAs per the tweet, SOL outperformed every other chain, including Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Polygon [MATIC], in yearly NFT blockchain user adoption.\n\nWhile SOL\u2019s number of users grew by 33% in the past 365 days, MATIC, BTC, and ETH\u2019s users grew by 29%, 10%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at DappRadar\u2019s data revealed that MadLads, Frogana, and Sharx by sharky.fi were the top NFT collections on Solana, which might have contributed towards the aforementioned achievement.\n\nDespite promising 365-day growth, things started to change in the last month. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Cryptoslam\u2019s data pointed out that SOL\u2019s NFT sales volume dropped by over 36% last month, as did its total number of buyers and sellers.\n\nIts total NFT transactions also dipped by 11%.

At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $145.55 with a market capitalization of over $65 billion, making it the 5th largest crypto.\n\nThe decline in price also took a toll on the token\u2019s social metrics. SOL\u2019s social volume declined over the past month, reflecting a decrease in its popularity in the crypto space.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s weighted sentiment also remained in the negative zone for the majority of the days. This clearly suggested that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market.\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed the token\u2019s daily chart to find whether this bearish price trend would continue longer.

        "content": "Selling pressure on Ethereum rose over the past week\n\nMost market indicators looked bearish on ETH\u2019s charts\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price managed to climb past $3.2k last week. Soon after, however, the altcoin turned bearish as ETH was unable to hold its position on the charts. Given how everything has panned out, if the worst scenario is to be considered here, ETH might fall to its $2.7k support level.\n\nMore red for Ethereum\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price appreciated by 2% last week, allowing it to go past $3.2k on 24 April. However, the uptrend didn\u2019t last long as its price dropped over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,118.13 with a market capitalization of over $380 billion.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, 79% of Ethereum investors are still in profit. The decline in ETH\u2019s price also affected its social volume negatively. Additionally, after a spike on 25 April, its weighted sentiment dropped on the charts. This alluded to bearish sentiment around ETH being on the higher side.\n\nThings can get worse, however, as if ETH records more price corrections, its value might drop to the $2.7k support level in the coming days, as per a recent tweet from Crypto Tony, a popular crypto analyst. The possibility of ETH hitting that support level would increase if it fails to go above $3.6k.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto took a look at Santiment\u2019s data to see whether metrics seemed bearish.\n\nWe found that selling pressure on the token has been increasing. This was evidenced by the hike in its exchange inflows over the past week. The fact that selling pressure was high was further proven by ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges, which rise.\n\nOn the contrary however, whales remain confident in ETH as its supply held by top addresses went up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s immediate support levels\n\nAMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s daily chart to find whether a sustained downtrend is inevitable or not. We found that the Money Flow Index (MFI) went north \u2013 A sign predicting a price uptick.\n\nNonetheless, the rest of the indicators seemed bearish. For instance, both ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) headed south, meaning that the chances of a further price drop were high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nFinally, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital\u2019s data revealed that ETH has a strong support level near $3.1k if a price correction happens.\n\nA drop below that level could result in ETH plummeting to $2.8k before it reaches its tested support level at $2.7k in the coming days or weeks."

        "content": "Whales continued to stockpile ETH despite being under water.\n\nMajority of whale positions were longing ETH in derivatives markets.\n\nEthereum [ETH] sank 4.73% over the last 24 hours of trading, reversing the bullish momentum which it gathered following Bitcoin\u2019s halving. The second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $3,125 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe slump however, failed to influence the market behavior of whale investors, as the latter still seemed bullish on ETH\u2019s prospects.\n\nWhales buy ETH\u2019s dip\n\nAccording to on-chain tracking platform Spot On Chain, whales accumulated hefty amount of ETH in the last 24 hours.\n\nA particular wallet with address 0xe0b snapped 1,524 stETH at an average price of $3,159. With this grab, the wallet owner pushed their total stETH holdings beyond $10 million, earning an estimated 3.42% profit.\n\nIn a bigger purchase, a whale amassed 7,128 ETH, worth $22 million at prevailing prices, at $3,111. The wealthy investor reportedly sat on a huge $482 million worth of ETH stash.\n\nAs of this writing, the holder was in a state of unrealized loss.\n\nSupply held by top addresses increase\n\nThese were not isolated developments though. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, ETH whales upped their transaction activity in the last 2-3 days, as seen by the jump in large transfers exceeding $100k.\n\nMoreover, the share of total supply held by top addresses rose from 41.37% on the halving day to 41.45% on the 24th of April, suggesting accumulation by whales.\n\nWhales still betting on ETH\u2019s rise\n\nOn the derivatives markets too, majority of the whales were bullishly positioned. About 63% of the total whale positions on Binance were long on ETH, as per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThough, it was worth mentioning that the long exposure came down after the halving.\n\nThe market sentiment leaned towards greed, indicating the possibility of increase in buying pressure in the days to come. This could support ETH\u2019s rebound in the days ahead."

        "content": "Though dev activity dropped, Polkadot\u2019s network activity hiked on the charts\n\nA trend reversal could be on the cards for DOT\u2019s price action\n\nPolkadot [DOT] has been renowned for having robust development activity consistently over the years. However, as per recent data, other blockchains like Ethereum [ETH] and BNB Chain have emerged to overtake its levels over the last few days. While this shift happened, DOT\u2019s price action turned bearish on the charts.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s development activity drops\n\nCoin98 Analytics recently shared a tweet mentioning a list of blockchains ranked in terms of their development activity. As per the tweet, Polkadot registered 827 developers last week, with the blockchain witnessing over 5000 weekly code commits.\n\nThough the number by itself wasn\u2019t low, it was lower than other blockchains. For instance, ETH had more than 2000 weekly developers who executed over 19,000 commits. Polkadot was also behind BNB Chain, whose weekly commits exceeded 6,000.\n\nOther blockchains that outshined DOT were Polygon [MATIC] and Optimism [OP], whose weekly commits stood at 6,300 and 5,200, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data also revealed a similar story. We found that DOT\u2019s development activity dropped sharply over the last seven days. However, despite the drop in dev activity, the blockchain\u2019s dev activity contributor count spiked multiple times last week.\n\nHere, it is interesting to note that while the blockchain\u2019s dev activity fell, its network activity registered a massive spike last week.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Artemis\u2019 data revealed that after several days of dormancy, DOT\u2019s daily active addresses shot up considerably on 24 April. Thanks to the rise in active addresses, its daily transaction count also followed a similar trend.\n\nBears are attacking DOT\n\nIn the meantime, Polkadot bears buckled up as the token\u2019s price dipped on the charts. According to CoinMarketCap, DOT lost more than 1.5% of its value in the last seven days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s value dipped by 2%. At press time, DOT was trading at $6.70 with a market capitalization of over $9.6 billion.\n\nDOT\u2019s funding rate has risen over the last few days too. This is a bearish development as prices tend to move in the opposite direction from the funding rate.\n\nNonetheless, Polkadot\u2019s open interest also went down. A decline in the metric is a sign that chances of the ongoing market trend changing are high.\n\nRead Polkadot\u2019s [DOT] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nDOT\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick and was heading further above the neutral level, suggesting a possible price hike.\n\nFinally, as per the Bollinger Bands, DOT\u2019s price was resting under its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A successful breakout above that level could result in a fresh bull run for the altcoin on the charts."

        "title": "What next for Bitcoin, Ethereum as $9.3B options expiry looms - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Most of the bets predicted a bullish close for BTC and ETH.\n\nETH might drop below the max pain point while BTC might end the week above it.\n\nMore than 96,000 option contracts of Bitcoin [BTC] and 978,000 for Ethereum [ETH] are set to expire on Friday, 26th April.\n\nAccording to derivatives exchange Deribit, the BTC contracts were valued at $6.2 billion while ETH contracts were worth $3.1 billion, bringing the total to a mind-blowing $9.3 billion.\n\nWith options, traders can purchase contracts that allow them to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price. As options near expiry, traders must decide if to buy, sell, or close the contract.\n\nOptimism rises despite the decline\n\nDetails AMBCrypto got from Deribit showed that the BTC put-call ratio was negative. This indicates that most of the bets were calls and traders were bullish on the coin price.\n\nIt was a similar case for ETH. For those unfamiliar, buying a call option means that a trader will make money if the price goes up. On the other hand, a put option is a bearish bet, meaning a trader will make profits if the price declines.\n\nDepending on where BTC and ETH prices close, the exchange noted that sellers might gain the most if BTC hits $61,000. In ETH\u2019s case, buyers might lose a lot of money if the value of the altcoin reaches $3,100.\n\n\u201cBitcoin options and the removal of a 61k max pain price point, together with the expiring open interest of nearly $3 billion in Ethereum options and the removal of a $3.1k max pain price point.\u201d\n\nAt press time, BTC\u2019s price was $64,140, representing an 8.52% decrease in the last 30 days. ETH, on the other hand, changed hands at $3,129\u2014 a 12.46% 30-day decrease.\n\nDifferent patterns for the top two\n\nTo ascertain where the price might close this week, AMBCrypto looked at the liquidation heatmap. Liquidation heatmap shows traders high areas of liquidity (magnetic zone).\n\nThis helps to identify potential large liquidation points, and the possibility of prices moving toward certain regions. According to data obtained from Hyblock, a magnetic zone (colored yellow) appeared on the BTC liquidation heatmap at $67,250.\n\nTo the downside, another magnetic area was at $62,600. If Bitcoin\u2019s price moves toward $67,250, then most option contracts will end up making money from their bets.\n\nOn the other hand, a decline toward $62,600 could cause losses. However, the pain might be minimal as long as the price does not hit $61,000.\n\nHowever, it might not be the same case for traders who went with the ETH call option.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAt press time, the high area of liquidity was around $3,025, indicating that the price might decline below the $3,100 max pain threshold.\n\nIf this happens, a large part of the $3.1 billion set to expire could be wiped out. However, if ETH stays above $3,100, puts might not be the only ones to gain from the price action."

        "title": "Ethereum validators stay put \u2013 Where does that leave ETH\u2019s price? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Voluntary exit on Ethereum fell to a one-month low.\n\nDespite last week\u2019s price rally, bearish sentiments remain significant in the ETH market.\n\nThe daily count of validators exiting the Ethereum [ETH] network recently cratered to a 30-day low, data from Glassnode showed.\n\nThis occurred due to the recent decline in demand for the proof-of-stake (PoS) network. AMBCrypto previously reported that user activity on Ethereum has declined over the last month.\n\nThis resulted in a low ETH burn rate, which has increased the coin\u2019s supply and made it inflationary once again.\n\nWhen ETH becomes inflationary, its price experiences significant downward pressure. According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, the coin\u2019s value has dropped by 13% in the last month.\n\nDue to ETH\u2019s low price action, validators on the Ethereum network have not been incentivized to unstake their coins for onward sales.\n\nThe network typically witnesses a surge in validator exit when ETH price climbs, causing validators to attempt to capture gains on their previously staked coins.\n\nWith fewer validators leaving the network, the participation rate among validators has also risen to its highest in the last month.\n\nValidators must participate in the network to ensure that Ethereum runs optimally. A high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime, fewer missed blocks, and superior blockspace efficiency.\n\nAs of this writing, the validators\u2019 participation rate on the network was 99.6%.\n\nETH gains, but at what cost?\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,150, recording a 5% value uptick in the last week. This price growth has been due to a minor resurgence in bullish sentiments among market participants, which AMBCrypto gleaned from its readings of the coin\u2019s key technical indicators on a one-day chart.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s MACD line rested above its signal line at press time. This signaled that ETH\u2019s short-term moving average is above its long-term moving average. It is viewed as a bullish signal and interpreted as an indication to take long and exit short positions.\n\nLikewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of money into and out of the market, returned a positive value at press time. This showed that the ETH market had a steady liquidity supply.\n\nHowever, bearish sentiments lingered in the market. The value of the coin\u2019s Elder-Ray Index was -61.96 at the time of press. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhen its value is negative, bear power is dominant in the market.\n\nConfirming the strength of ETH bears, its negative directional index (red) was positioned above its positive index. This showed that coin sellers had more presence in the market than buyers."

        "content": "There are several blockchain networks competing for a piece of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract and DeFi market share. Projects like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Avalanche are some of the most prominent \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHowever, it also faces some challenges, such as high gas fees, network congestion, scalability issues, and environmental concerns. Therefore, many other blockchain platforms have emerged as potential competitors or alternatives to Ethereum, offering different features and advantages.\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the most prominent Ethereum competitors and look into the pros and cons of 6 crypto projects that are vying to become the next Ethereum.\n\nNative Coin Total Unique Add. Txs Per Sec. Avg. Tx Fee TVL Market Cap Ethereum ETH 264 mln 30 $4.99 $67 bln $382 bln BNB Smart Chain BNB 444 mln 2,200 $0.0982 $7.8 bln $88.8 bln Solana SOL 28 mln 4,233 $0.005 $5.7 mln $63.9 bln Cardano ADA 4.4 mln 1,000+ $0.16 $397 mln $16.7 bln Tron TRX 225 mln 2,000 $0.95 $8.6 bln $11.0 bln Avalanche AVAX 20 mln 4,500 $0.084 $1.1 bln $13.3 bln Polkadot DOT No data 1,000 Parachain specific $265 mln* $6.8 bln\n\nData collected on April 26, 2024.\n\n*Polkadot\u2019s TVL is calculated as the total sum of TVL across Polkadot parachains (Moonbeam, Acala, etc.)\n\nWhat is the next Ethereum? Analyzing the top 6 \u201cEthereum killers\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d, we are referring to cryptocurrency projects that are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology for developing DeFi and NFT solutions, which is currently the arena Ethereum is dominating thanks to its first mover advantage. In the following sections, we are going to examine six projects with robust feature sets and active communities that could challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominating market share in the future.\n\n1. BNB Smart Chain\n\nBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain platform launched by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Powered by its native token BNB, BSC aims to provide an alternative to the Ethereum network by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It achieves this by using a different consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily migrate their dApps from Ethereum to BSC, leveraging its high throughput and low fees.\n\nWhy is BNB Smart Chain considered the next Ethereum?\n\nThanks to a large number of users, familiar features that are heavily inspired by the Ethereum blockchain, and backing by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, BNB Smart Chain is considered the top Ethereum killer.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It leverages a unique combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana's scalability and throughput make it an attractive option for developers looking to build complex applications that require high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhy is Solana considered the next Ethereum?\n\nSolana is one of the most energy-efficient and cheapest crypto networks for transferring value. In addition, Solana features a healthy ecosystem of dApps and an active community, despite SOL\u2019s rapid price decrease last year due to its connection with the now defunct FTX exchange.\n\n3. Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Built using a peer-reviewed academic approach, Cardano boasts a high level of security and scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which ensures that the network remains decentralized while maintaining fast transaction processing.\n\nWhy is Cardano considered the next Ethereum?\n\nCardano is not only one of the most popular crypto projects but also one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, making it not only one of the top Ethereum killers but also a potentially good investment overall.\n\n4. Tron\n\nTron (TRX) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a decentralized digital entertainment ecosystem. It focuses on providing a decentralized infrastructure for content creators and consumers in the entertainment industry. Tron offers high throughput and low transaction fees, making it suitable for applications such as gaming, social media, and digital content distribution.\n\nWhy is Tron considered the next Ethereum?\n\nOver the years, Tron has emerged as a credible alternative to Ethereum due to its transaction speed and overlapping features. In recent years, Tron has also looked to expand its offering, integrating decentralized file-sharing capabilities with the acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) and launching a decentralized stablecoin, USDD.\n\n5. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, security, and decentralization. It utilizes a novel consensus protocol called Avalanche, which enables high throughput and fast finality. Avalanche's unique approach to consensus makes it highly resilient to attacks and allows for quick transaction confirmations, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a scalable and secure blockchain platform.\n\nWhy is Avalanche considered the next Ethereum?\n\nAvalanche\u2019s focus is on overcoming some of Ethereum's scalability and speed limitations. While the blockchain itself is capable of processing about 150 times the number of transactions as Ethereum, Avalanche has struggled to build a dApp and NFT ecosystem that could challenge Ethereum, at least so far.\n\n6. Polkadot\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain platform that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. It aims to create a decentralized internet where different blockchains can communicate and share information securely. Polkadot's unique architecture allows for interoperability between different chains, facilitating seamless data transfer and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains simultaneously.\n\nWhy is Polkadot considered the next Ethereum?\n\nPolkadot was conceived by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist and co-founder of Ethereum. Wood launched Polkadot with the intention of enhancing scalability with \u201cparachains\u201d, which enable parallel processing of transactions, allowing Polkadot to handle a larger volume of transactions compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhich are considered \u201cEthereum killer\u201d coins?\n\nIn addition to the blockchain networks described above, like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, there are numerous other platforms considered members of the group of Layer 1 networks called Ethereum killers.\n\nSome examples of blockchain platforms that have an overlapping feature set, such as Ethereum, include several smaller market cap projects, including Cosmos, Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol, Tezos, Algorand, and Fantom.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that several Layer 2 solutions that aim to alleviate scalability issues on the Ethereum network, like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism, are also considered by some as Ethereum competitors. However, that categorization would be somewhat nonsensical, as these solutions aim to enhance the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, not replace it.\n\nAre Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology, but they have different purposes and features. Bitcoin is designed as a digital currency and a store of value, while Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, they are not direct competitors but rather complementary projects that aim to solve different problems using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of traders and investors, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be seen as competitors as they vie for market share and adoption. Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has a high level of security, decentralization, and network effects. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it has a high level of innovation, functionality, and scalability. Both cryptocurrencies have their advantages and disadvantages, and their performance may vary depending on market conditions and user demand.\n\nThe bottom line: There are several blockchain platforms vying to become the next Ethereum\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain platform to build the necessary infrastructure and building blocks to support the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized financial systems, and new tokens, thanks to the ERC-20 token standard. Since its launch in 2015, numerous other networks have tried to overcome Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage, but to no avail. BSC comes the closest, especially in terms of active users. However, the ecosystem of products and services is considerably smaller on BSC than on Ethereum. Other networks, like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, are even further removed, despite their ability to process considerably more transactions and at a lower price than Ethereum\n\nFor more information about whether it is a good idea to buy Ethereum, and what are the pros and cons of investing in Ethereum, you can check the video below."
