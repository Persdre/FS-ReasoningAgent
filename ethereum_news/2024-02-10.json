        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has expressed confidence in the future of the network, underscoring its potential to surpass Ethereum in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovation.\n\nSpeaking during a recent interview with Dan Gambardello, host of the Crypto Capital Venture YouTube channel, Hoskinson noted the remarkable growth of the Cardano ecosystem, especially in the face of challenging market conditions. He emphasized the community\u2019s dedication and collaborative efforts in propelling Cardano forward.\n\nDespite initial scepticism labelling Cardano as a \u201cghost chain,\u201d he stressed how the project had defied expectations, boasting over half a billion dollars in total value locked (TVL) during a bear market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had overwhelming participation and constant growth and innovation,\u201d said Hoskinson, highlighting the vibrant activity within the Cardano ecosystem, with numerous projects and transactions fueling its expansion.\n\nAddressing criticisms and comparisons to Ethereum, Hoskinson underscored Cardano\u2019s steady progress and its distinct approach to scalability, governance, and innovation. He pointed out the misconceptions surrounding benchmarks like TVL and ADA price, emphasizing the significance of Cardano\u2019s comprehensive roadmap and its focus on building a robust infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know how to scale, we know how to get fast finality, we know how to get partner chains in, we know how to get rollups in,\u201d Hoskinson asserted, outlining Cardano\u2019s strategic initiatives to address scalability and network efficiency.\n\nAccording to the pundit, a pivotal aspect of Cardano\u2019s future success lies in its governance model and the utilization of its treasury funds. With nearly $750 million worth of ADA in the Cardano treasury, Hoskinson highlighted the community\u2019s governance over these resources, enabling strategic investments in ecosystem growth and development.\n\nMoreover, Hoskinson emphasized Cardano\u2019s collaborative approach and burgeoning partnerships with other blockchain projects. He also highlighted the interoperability and synergies fostered by Cardano\u2019s Partner Chains framework, enabling seamless integration with other blockchain ecosystems.\n\nHoskinson expressed confidence in Cardano\u2019s potential to become the dominant governance system in the crypto space, toppling networks such as Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting recursion and rollups and that means all this stuff that\u2019s happening in Ethereum not only works on Cardano works best on Cardano\u2026so we will be probably one of the dominant zero knowledge layers thanks to all the work,\u201d he added.\n\nIn light of recent developments like the intersect platform and advancements in scalability solutions, Hoskinson asserted that Cardano is poised for exponential growth. He encouraged a shift away from tribalism and adversarial dynamics within the crypto space, emphasizing the collective benefits of collaboration and innovation."

        "content": "Sat 10 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum, the pioneering blockchain recognized for its crypto innovation and flexibility, has reached a historic milestone: that of 2 million daily active users. This unprecedented event not only underscores the platform\u2019s rapid growth but also heralds dizzying developmental prospects for the years to come.\n\nAn Expanding Ecosystem\n\nEthereum has always been at the forefront of blockchain technology, far surpassing its competitors in terms of active users and revenue generation for its holders (HODLers).\n\nThe platform has undergone a radical transformation since its inception, evolving from an energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) system to a more sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) model under the guidance of Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThis transition to PoS, requiring validators to stake a significant amount of the ETH cryptocurrency, has not only reduced the blockchain\u2019s carbon footprint but also strengthened the network\u2019s security and efficiency.\n\nCrossing the threshold of 2 million daily active users is indicative of Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness and robustness.\n\nThe Ethereum community, with its unwavering commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, has made possible what seemed to be a distant goal.\n\nThe successful implementation of Layer 2 (L2) solutions to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs is a key factor in this exponential growth.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Future Anticipations\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum\u2019s price is also a crucial indicator of its vitality and potential.\n\nDespite market turbulence, characterized by significant price fluctuations of major cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has demonstrated impressive resilience and bullish trends, surpassing the $2500 barrier. This performance is partly attributable to the positive anticipation surrounding the launch of the first Ethereum spot ETFs in the United States, a development that promises to inject additional liquidity into the Ethereum market.\n\nThe introduction of an Ethereum spot ETF represents a major step towards recognizing Ethereum as an investable and legitimate asset class. This development could not only attract a broader spectrum of institutional and traditional investors but also strengthen confidence in altcoins. However, regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge, with an ambiguous approach from regulators, underscoring the complexity of classifying Ethereum as a security or currency.\n\nThe future of Ethereum seems more promising than ever, with ongoing technical developments aimed at improving its scalability and further reducing transaction fees. The imminent Denchain upgrade, which targets the enhancement of layer 2 protocols, is particularly anticipated. This technical evolution, coupled with market optimism and increased liquidity due to spot ETFs, positions Ethereum on an upward trajectory towards new peaks.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "A recently published report by Finder conducted in January 2024 and shared with Coingape features the combined opinions of 40 crypto industry experts on the price projections for Ethereum (ETH) up to 2030. This survey, being a notable move to assess the growth potential of Ethereum, has delivered a common idea that there is a great future perspective of ETH among the participants.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Trajectory of Price Through 2030\n\nAs per the findings, the panelists expect a big rise in the market value of Ethereum and an average price of $4,887 by the end of 2024. This upward trend is expected to persist, with projections indicating a further growth to $7,492 by 2025 and an amazing jump to $19,190 by 2030.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese forecasts are all the more positive than the panel surveys in October 2023 and January 2023 and, in another way, highlight that the market and its performance are winning the confidence of market actors.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum (ETH) has had a bullish rally in the last 24 hours with price bouncing between an intra-day low and high of $2,475 and $2,522. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $2,492, a 0.30% surge from the support level. During the rally, ETH market market capitalization surged to $299,492,362,705 while the 24-hour trading volume dipped by 36% to $8,169,785,827.\n\nExpert Ethereum Insights\n\nJonathan Hababou Solomon, co-founder and co-CEO of A.R.I.A., emphasized the significant milestone of Ethereum exceeding $2,470, indicative of a reversion to the bullish mode. Solomon and other experts, including Damian Chmiel of Finance Magnates, noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are strongly correlated. That suggests Ethereum may benefit from the same catalysts that have previously pushed Bitcoin up, such as ETF regimes and halving events.\n\nPedro Febrero, VP of Web3 at RealFevr, noted that Ethereum is in fact undervalued when compared to Bitcoin, considering its massive adoption and capabilities in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, etc. Nonetheless, experts\u2019 viewpoints on Ethereum\u2019s imminent future differed.\n\nWhilst some, including Josh Fraser of Origin Protocol, foresee an ETH peak price of $17,000 in 2024, influenced by such factors as possible ETFs and diminishing sell pressure, others, such as John Hawkins of the University of Canberra, take a more careful approach and predict a decline to $2,000.\n\nThe Consensus on Buying, Holding, or Selling ETH\n\nThe survey shows a strong preference for buying ETH, as 71% of the panelists recommend the acquisition at the current time. The expectation of Ethereum ETFs and the changing discourse around on-chain assets and decentralized applications gives credence to this view. Identically, a very small 3% of the shareholders believe that the best time to dispose of ETH is today because of the belief in the future development of Ethereum.\n\nDiversity of views is what one comes across in the discussion on the current valuation of Ethereum. Due to its impressive growth and potential as a global settlement layer, about half of the panelists think ETH is undervalued. On the other hand, however, a sizable 45% believe that Ethereum is fairly priced given the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential for a similar event happening for Ethereum. Though a small fraction of the market views ETH as overpriced, the persistent system flaws within the Ethereum network are pointed at.\n\nThe survey further looked at the competition between Ethereum and new blockchain platforms, such as Solana. The majority of analysts (66%) have predicted that crypto fans will rely on the usage of Ethereum and Solana, thus taking advantage of the different features each provides. This point of view leads to a diverse and multi-chain future of the blockchain industry where different platforms meet the needs and choices of different groups of users.\n\nRead Also: XRP Price Prediction As Renewed Recovery Hints 14% Surge, But There\u2019s A Catch\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.

        "title": "$3,000 Is Next for Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) Shows Massive Breakthrough, Solana's (SOL) Suspicious Rally - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to evolve with its recent ERC-404 token standard being massively implemented, its native asset is finally gaining some traction on the market. It is showcasing promising growth, and its price trajectory suggests that the coveted $3,000 mark may be on the horizon.\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum's price chart reveals a steady upward trend, with the asset recently crossing the $2,500 threshold. The next significant resistance level appears to be at $2,600, a point that has previously seen sellers stepping in. A break and hold above this level could pave the way for Ethereum's ascent toward the $3,000 psychological and technical barrier.\n\nSupporting this potential growth scenario is the continued development of the Ethereum network, including the anticipated benefits of the ERC-404 update. This new standard is expected to enhance the utility and interoperability of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, potentially increasing demand for ETH as the required \"fuel\" for deploying tokens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there remains a cautionary scenario to consider. Ethereum's rival, Solana, has recently experienced a slowdown due to network outages, which could potentially cause a ripple effect across the broader crypto market. If such events lead to a loss of confidence in blockchain networks or a shift in investor sentiment, Ethereum could face a setback.\n\nA potential price drop scenario could be triggered by technical rejections at the $2,600 resistance level, coupled with negative market sentiment stemming from issues in competing blockchains like Solana. Should Ethereum fail to sustain its momentum, a pullback toward the local support level at $2,300 may occur, where buyers have previously shown interest.\n\nCardano remains strong\n\nCardano (ADA) has recently demonstrated a significant breakthrough in price action, suggesting a bullish trend could be forming. Cardano's price has been tracing an upward trajectory, recently punctuating this ascent by breaching a key resistance level.\n\nA technical analysis of ADA's chart indicates that the cryptocurrency has managed to surpass the resistance near $0.515, which had previously capped several attempts at an upward move. Closing above this level could signal newfound confidence among investors and pave the way for further gains.\n\nOn the growth front, if ADA sustains its momentum above this resistance turned support level, the next target for the asset could be the $0.580 mark. Such a move would represent a significant uptick in market valuation and could attract more attention to Cardano as a viable investment in the blockchain space.\n\nHowever, every market scenario has its counterpart. Should ADA face rejection at higher levels, there is potential for a pullback toward the local support at $0.485. A drop below this point might compel traders to reassess the short-term outlook for Cardano, potentially leading to a consolidation phase or even a deeper correction if broader market sentiment turns negative.\n\nSolana slows down\n\nThe recent price movements of Solana have caught the eye of many in the cryptocurrency community, with its ascent on the charts prompting discussions around the sustainability of its rally. Despite the uptick, there is a pervading sentiment of caution as the momentum behind the rise appears to lack conviction.\n\nAn analysis of Solana's trading patterns reveals that while SOL has made strides to overcome resistance, achieving a local high of approximately $112, the rally's foundation seems tenuous. The support level to watch is around $98.89, where SOL has previously found a degree of stability. Should the asset maintain above this level, it might dispel some of the skepticism surrounding its recent performance.\n\nHowever, the growth scenario for Solana is shadowed by concerns of a potential breakdown. The momentum indicator on the charts suggests that the energy behind the rally is not as robust as investors might desire. If Solana fails to sustain the buying pressure needed to push higher, it could see a retreat back to the support level or even lower, which might trigger a more pronounced sell-off."

        "title": "Ethereum revolutionizes NFTs with ERC-404! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Sat 10 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nA completely new Ethereum standard named ERC-404 is currently under development. Spearheaded by creators \u201cctrl\u201d and \u201cAcme,\u201d this ambitious project aims to merge the fungible ERC-20 tokens with the usually incompatible ERC-721 NFTs. Behind this revolutionary idea lies the potential for fractional ownership of NFTs, a concept with profound implications.\n\nThe ERC-404 Hybrid Token Concept\n\nThe purpose of the ERC-404 standard is to combine the ERC-20 standards, which define fungible tokens such as USDT, with ERC-721, used for unique NFTs. This ambitious merge would result in a hybrid token that brings together the best of both worlds.\n\nSpecifically, ERC-404 tokens would allow multiple wallets to own fractions of the same iconic NFT. This way, it would be possible to own shares in a Bored Ape Yacht Club or a rare digital artwork. These fractional shares would then be tradable or usable, just like any ERC-20 token.\n\nThis disintermediated innovation in the field of NFT ownership opens up new use cases. For instance, lenders could accept fractions of an NFT as collateral, instead of having to seize the entire NFT. However, the technical challenges are complex for a successful integration of the two standards.\n\nEthereum, Adoption, and Criticisms Raised by ERC-404\n\nAlthough its development is still experimental, the ERC-404 standard has already garnered a lot of interest within the crypto ecosystem. Industry giants like Binance and OKX quickly announced their support for the standard before retracting it.\n\nThe Pandora token, the first to adopt ERC-404, experienced explosive growth in its valuation. Other projects using ERC-404 have also emerged, demonstrating the potential of this concept.\n\nHowever, ERC-404 also draws criticisms from within the crypto community. Some developers such as \u201cquit\u201d have warned against security flaws, like the potential theft of fractionated NFTs on poorly-configured lending platforms.\n\nThe creators of the standard have downplayed these risks, attributing the issues more to an incorrect implementation of ERC-404. Regardless, utmost caution remains paramount when it comes to the security of this experimental technology. Its adoption will require thorough audits and checks before it is deemed safe. With their ERC-404 standard, Ethereum developers are pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovation by merging two previously incompatible standards.\n\nDespite the technical challenges and controversies, this promising concept of fractional NFTs is already generating a tremendous amount of excitement. If properly audited and secured, Ethereum\u2019s ERC-404 could become a major revolution for the future of cryptocurrencies and digital ownership. The next steps of this experimental project are crucial.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is facing a reality check as the innovative ERC-404 sector on Ethereum experiences a substantial drop. In the past 24 hours, the market capitalization of ERC-404 tokens has plummeted by 29%, with tokens like PANDORA sliding over 15%, DEFROGS tumbling over 22% and RUG collapsing by a staggering 38%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ERC-404 standard was hailed as Ethereum's beacon of innovation, potentially the new fuel for a bull run akin to the impact of NFTs in 2021 and ICOs in 2017. However, the sharp and swift capitulation in market capitalization raises a lot of unpleasant questions over its viability as Ethereum's \"last hope\" for a resurgence.\n\nThis standard was envisioned to create tokens that are both fungible, like ERC-20, and unique, like ERC-721, adding a layer of value through associated NFTs that could be rare or hold special significance.\n\nTaking PANDORA as an example, purchasing this ERC-404 token on exchanges like Uniswap not only grants the token itself but also an unique NFT, introducing an element of chance and gamification to trading and ownership. Acquiring a rare NFT could potentially amplify an investor's portfolio value, and selling it on platforms like Blur or OpenSea would simultaneously execute the sale of the linked token.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current decline of ERC-404 tokens, however, signals potential trouble for Ethereum. The rapid devaluation challenges the premise that ERC-404 could lead to a new era of growth for Ethereum.\n\nIf ERC-404 tokens continue to lose ground, it could reflect negatively on Ethereum's capacity to innovate and sustain new developmental trends. Ethereum's future now depends on its ability to adapt and overcome the market's skepticism, finding new pathways to innovation that can revive confidence and investment in its ecosystem."

        "content": "Sun 11 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nGeth, short for Go Ethereum, is an open-source software client for the Ethereum network. It is a crucial tool for Ethereum developers, miners, validators, and users. Its popularity is due to the numerous crypto benefits it offers. However, over-reliance on this tool can be harmful, according to warnings from several analysts.\n\nA Challenge Involving Ethereum that Endangers Crypto Exchanges\n\nCoinbase, Kraken, and several other major players in the crypto sphere are facing a critical issue within the Ethereum network. It\u2019s their over-reliance on a single software client named Geth.\n\nThis dependency poses significant risks. Experts warn against the potential catastrophic consequences if a bug were discovered in Geth. As a reminder, this client is used by nearly 80% of Ethereum validators!\n\nRecent incidents, such as a bug in the less frequently used software Nethermind, have already highlighted the vulnerability of the Ethereum ecosystem. With Geth dominating the crypto activities involving validators, any bug in this software could disrupt the processing of transactions.\n\nAnalysts are apprehensive of this prospect. According to them, such a scenario would have severe consequences for the crypto industry players. Moreover, such an incident could result in losses for investors and even lead to a fragmentation of the network.\n\nMany Ethereum validators use the same software, fueling worries about what happens if there's a bug https://t.co/Efrroa4iSs \u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 8, 2024 Coinbase and Kraken are looking for alternatives to Geth to diversify and secure operations on Ethereum\n\nPalliative Initiatives Are Taking Shape\n\nIt must be said that some crypto industry players seem to grasp the magnitude of the situation. Criticisms about the lack of diversity among client software used by validators have spurred some crypto providers to explore alternative solutions.\n\nConsequently, Coinbase and Kraken are actively considering the integration of smaller software clients into their platforms to mitigate risks associated with Geth\u2019s dominance. This already marks the beginning of a response to these growing concerns.\n\nBut the urgency to meet these diversification challenges in a sustainable way is evident. Especially when considering the significant financial stakes involved and the broader implications for the stability and growth of Ethereum.\n\nUltimately, the realization of these diversification efforts and increased vigilance are essential to ensure the stability and long-term success of crypto platforms.

        "title": "Prediction: Solana Will Reach $260 In 2025 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Solana could be on a trajectory to reclaim its all-time high of $260. But a lot still needs to go right.\n\nIn 2023, Solana (SOL -0.86%) was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, up more than 1,000% for the year at one point. While that performance might be impossible to top in 2024, there's reason to think that Solana still has plenty more upside from its current price of $100.\n\nIn fact, Solana might now be on a trajectory to reclaim its all-time high of $260 by the end of 2025. Let's take a closer look at what needs to go right for Solana for this to happen.\n\nSurge in network activity\n\nOne of the most promising signs for Solana has been the rapid growth taking place on its blockchain network. New users, for example, recently surged to their highest level since 2022. Overall network activity, as measured by metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), continues to show signs of improvement.\n\nMost importantly, trading volume on Solana's decentralized exchanges continues to grow quickly. This sudden display of strength in decentralized finance (DeFi) is notable, since it is an area where Solana has historically lagged. In fact, by the end of 2023, Solana was starting to eclipse its chief rival Ethereum (ETH -0.73%) in terms of overall trading volume on its decentralized exchanges.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum\n\nThat brings us to the No. 1 reason why I think Solana has the potential to skyrocket in value between now and the end of 2025: Solana is the one blockchain most capable of supplanting Ethereum as the market leader. Ever since it launched in 2015, Ethereum has reigned supreme in the smart contract blockchain space. But now, nearly a decade later, it looks like Solana could be ready to topple Ethereum.\n\nThe narrative about Solana as a so-called \"Ethereum killer\" has existed since it launched in 2020, due to its superior transaction processing speeds and lower costs. Now this narrative is really gaining steam with high-profile institutional investors. At the end of 2023, for example, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest pointed out on CNBC that Solana was a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum. That quickly led to a 20% boost in valuation.\n\nJust keep in mind, however, that Solana was trading for less than $10 at the end of 2022, and some traders thought it might eventually go to zero. So Solana is still a very risky, speculative investment.\n\nMost notably, I'm concerned that some of the recent surge in activity we've been seeing on the Solana blockchain is really just a lot of smoke and mirrors. The recent surge in trading activity, for example, seems to be coming from the speculative buying and selling of Solana meme coins.\n\nHow high can Solana go?\n\nWhile a price target of $260 for Solana might sound ultra-aggressive, it's really not. By way of comparison, investment firm VanEck recently set a price target of $3,200 for Solana. And we've already seen Solana soar by nearly 1,000% in 2023. So asking Solana to double or triple in value to reach a price it was trading at less than three years ago does not seem to be out of the realm of reason.\n\nMoreover, if you do some quick back-of-the-envelope math, it's possible to see a real path forward to $260. Ethereum's total market cap right now is $277 billion, while Solana's total market cap is $42 billion. So investors currently perceive Ethereum to be 6.5 times more valuable than Solana.\n\nIf you buy into the investment thesis that Solana is chipping away at Ethereum's dominance and setting itself up to eventually supplant Ethereum as the market leader, then the market caps of the two cryptos should converge at some point. From this perspective, the potential upside of Solana might be as high as $650!\n\nIs a price of $260 realistic?\n\nFor Solana to hit a price target of $260, a lot needs to go right. It needs to continue to chip away at Ethereum's dominance in key market niches, especially decentralized finance. It needs to convince more institutional investors that it really does have the potential to be an \"Ethereum killer,\" and it needs to innovate at a rapid pace, in order to attract new users and developers.\n\nThat being said, I'm extremely bullish on Solana going forward. The darkest days of the \"crypto winter\" now seem to be in the rearview mirror. Two years from now, I'm confident that we'll see Solana climbing to an all-time high of $260."

Savvy crypto portfolio managers are shifting significant portions of their funds out of stagnant cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Uniswap (UNI) into this new protocol. We contacted one fund manager to find out why he believes Kelexo (KLXO) could \u201c25x\u201d investor funds in 2024.\n\nThe Case for Ditching Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH) has long been a staple of crypto portfolios, but its glory days may be fading. The move to proof-of-stake drained enthusiasm and price momentum has been lackluster.\n\n\u201cEthereum (ETH) faces too much competition from faster and cheaper layer 1s today,\u201d explains a crypto fund manager. With momentum declining and hype disappearing, he expects Ethereum (ETH) to continue underperforming in 2024 as investors move funds into more promising opportunities.\n\nUniswap (UNI) is in Trouble Too\n\nUniswap (UNI), the leading decentralized exchange built on Ethereum (ETH), faces similar problems according to the same crypto fund manager.\n\nThe Uniswap (UNI) governance token has plummeted from all-time highs of over $44 in may 2021 to just $6.29 today as investor appetite vanishes. With its fortunes tied to Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) declining popularity, analysts think Uniswap (UNI) has little chance of rebounding strongly this year.\n\nThe Kelexo (KLXO) Opportunity\n\nIn contrast, analysts highlight Kelexo (KLXO) as an emerging project with massive upside potential in 2024.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve shifted 25% of my fund\u2019s Ethereum (ETH) and Uniswap (UNI) holdings into Kelexo (KLXO) because I think it could easily 25x from the current $0.022 presale price,\u201d one analyst reveals.\n\nHe highlights Kelexo\u2019s (KLXO) unique features including an advanced peer-to-peer lending platform, rewards programs and crypto debit card as key advantages over the flagging Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, Kelexo (KLXO) provides an innovative lending platform where borrowers and lenders interact directly with no intermediaries. It\u2019s faster, cheaper and more accessible than traditional finance. By eliminating clunky KYC checks, Kelexo (KLXO) offers users instant access to crypto loans and rates as low as 5%. All transactions are recorded transparently on the blockchain too.\n\nWith real utility backing Kelexo (KLXO), analysts predict explosive growth as the platform expands in 2024 and beyond.\n\nA chance at exponential returns\n\nSo for crypto investors looking for mammoth returns rather than marginal gains in 2024, Kelexo (KLXO) presents a compelling opportunity. The presale event makes entry possible at just $0.022\u23e4an incredible discount compared to its expected value later this year according to experts.\n\nTaking some funds out of tired cryptocurrencies Ethereum (ETH) and Uniswap (UNI) and putting them into this new and exciting disruptor makes perfect sense in 2024. Kelexo\u2019s (KLXO) RISE to dominance lifts off this year according to analysts, making now the ideal moment to dive in.\n\nFind out more about the Kelexo (KLXO) presale by visiting the website here.\n\n*This article was paid for.

This paled in comparison to zkSync Era\u2019s 30-day tally of 41.3 million.\n\nThe significant disparity in transaction numbers was due to the difference between the fees on the two scaling solutions. AMBCrypto noticed through L2 Fees that a user had to pay $0.14 on Arbitrum to send ETH while the same task could be performed on zkSync Era at a 64% discount.\n\nHowever, Arbitrum proponents in particular, and those of L2 in general, have pinned their hopes on the upcoming Dencun upgrade.

In contrast, DEXs on Base and zkSync Era couldn\u2019t even cross $300 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ARB\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nARB lifts 8.5% over the week\n\nAs of this writing, the native token ARB was trading in the green, with weekly gains of 8.5%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe jump in ARB value could be just sentiment-driven. As is well-known, ARB doesn\u2019t accrue any value from Arbitrum\u2019s on-chain activity and functions just as a governance token."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH\u2019s recent momentum is the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been the subject of considerable attention in recent days due to its price dynamics and upcoming developments. As of the latest data, Ethereum is trading at $2,450.98, with a 24-hour trading volume of $11,271,429,834 and a market capitalization of $294,438,478,059. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has experienced a positive growth rate of 1.19%, reflecting bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Ethereum\u2019s recent momentum is the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, which introduces proto-danksharding, a feature outlined in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844. This upgrade is poised to significantly enhance the functionality of layer-2 networks, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, by introducing an additional data field called a blob. The implementation of proto-danksharding is expected to increase transaction bandwidth for layer-2 solutions without extending processing timeframes on Ethereum\u2019s main network.\n\nDevelopers have hailed the Dencun upgrade as one of the most significant advancements since the activation of staked ETH withdrawals following Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake model, known as The Merge. The proposed deployment date for the Dencun upgrade is Mar. 13, pending any unforeseen delays. Successful deployments of the upgrade have already been witnessed on major Ethereum testnets, including Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.\n\nIn addition to the Dencun upgrade, another potential catalyst for Ethereum\u2019s price rally is the approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have postponed decisions on ETH ETF approvals until May. Moreover, individual commissioners have expressed differing opinions regarding the classification of Ethereum and similar assets.\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem evolves and new developments unfold, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits further insights into the impact of the Dencun upgrade and the potential approval of an ETH ETF. Traders and investors should monitor these developments closely as they navigate the dynamic landscape of the cryptocurrency market in the coming week.\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade progresses smoothly and gains widespread adoption among layer-2 networks, it could fuel bullish sentiment in the market. Positive feedback from developers and increased efficiency in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem may lead to a surge in demand for ETH, driving prices up by up to 10-15%. However, if Ethereum encounters technical challenges or delays during the implementation of the Dencun upgrade, investor confidence may wane, leading to a decrease in demand for ETH."
