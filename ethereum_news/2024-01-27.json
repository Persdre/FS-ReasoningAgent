        "title": "Where Will Ethereum Be in 5 Years? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum vs. the world: Check out how the smart-contract sector will evolve over the next few years, and how the leading platform compares to its main rivals.\n\nThe latest crypto winter is thawing out as we speak. From crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) driving institutional investor interest to planned technology upgrades to many of the leading crypto platforms, investors have found many new reasons to pay close attention to this space again.\n\nAs a result, smart-contract leader Ethereum (ETH -1.01%) has enjoyed a 46% price jump from the most recent market trough in October 2023. Archrivals Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO) nearly tripled over the same time span -- and up-and-comer Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) more than tripled.\n\nDoes Ethereum have the right moves to counter these high-stakes gambits from its competitors on the grand chessboard of public opinion and developer interest? Let's see how the next three years might play out for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Ethereum echoes Bitcoin's market melody\n\nFirst, let me point out that Ethereum tends to follow the price trends of sector giant Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in the long run -- sometimes amplified and sometimes muted in comparison to its larger cousin, but almost always moving in the same direction. In other words, the two charts are strongly correlated.\n\nSo when Bitcoin gears up for halving the rewards handed out to its miners, as it does roughly once every four years, that event is expected to drive both cryptocurrencies higher over the following year or so. That trend played out in 2016 and 2020 although Ethereum lagged behind Bitcoin's big gains in the former cycle. So the Bitcoin halving, scheduled for late April 2024, should pour fresh fuel on the fires of most cryptocurrencies -- Ethereum included.\n\nThe journey ahead: Ethereum's planned upgrades\n\nThe halving event should provide a rising tide to lift all encrypted boats, but how will Ethereum tackle the soaring competition? Would investors be better off in speed-focused rivals like Avalanche, Cardano, and Algorand in the long run?\n\nWell, let's see. Ethereum is in the middle of a multiyear platform upgrade, formerly known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2. The switch to a proof-of-stake system is already in the books, to be followed by several stepwise technical boosts over the next five to 10 years. The precise order of these updates will vary depending on many external factors, but the process should look something like this, according to the official Ethereum development roadmap:\n\nSharding will split the workload of validating transactions into smaller, more manageable batches. This speed-boosting upgrade is running ahead of schedule, as one early step turned out to be more helpful than expected.\n\nInstead of waiting 15 minutes for validation, the same processing batch could address both the creation and validation of the same transaction. This may be the next step, and a significant upgrade to Ethereum's transaction speed.\n\nSeveral security updates are in the works, aiming to protect the blockchain from different attack types. For example, hardening the blockchain against quantum computing attacks is currently seen as a low priority, but could move up the chain if quantum hardware makes a sudden performance leap. Stay tuned.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum executes every smart contract by referring to externally owned accounts (EOAs). This architecture helps developers pull in real-world data from so-called oracle networks such as Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) , resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative.\n\n, resulting in sophisticated contracts tied to stock prices, currency exchange trends, weather patterns, the moon phase, and so on. But it also adds complexity to the smart-contract system, slowing it down and exposing the platform to more bugs. Therefore, the Ethereum community is exploring different ways to replace this approach with a simpler and faster alternative. Finally, mastermind Vitalik Buterin wants Ethereum to be a stateless system in the long run. This next-level spin on sharding would allow each processing node to manage just a small slice of the blockchain's total data, lowering the costs of participation while increasing processing speeds dramatically. However, this is a true long-term goal requiring dramatic changes to Ethereum's technical platform, and you shouldn't expect it anytime soon.\n\nSo Ethereum is taking steps to match the ultra-fast transaction processing speed of Avalanche and Cardano while also building a more robust and flexible platform for blockchain-based app development. Only time will tell how closely the Ethereum project will stick to its stated long-term plans, but there have been more positive surprises than unexpected snags so far.\n\nEthereum looks ready to rumble\n\nIn my view, the ball is in the court of so-called \"Ethereum killers.\" The leading smart-contract platform looks ready to meet their challenges over the next few years.\n\nOf course, the upstarts aren't sitting on their digital hands. Cardano, Algorand, and Avalanche are also boosting their already fast processing speeds while aiming for greater stability. Any one of them might come up with a game-changing innovation someday.\n\nThe challengers are fighting an uphill battle, though. Ethereum got a head start on the rest of the field, setting industry standards and gathering developer interest several years before the other names even existed. The sheer inertia of an established developer group's existing preferences makes it hard for other platforms to steal Ethereum's smart-contract throne.\n\nBut the presence of several healthy rivals should also drive Ethereum to greater heights in the long run. I can't wait to see how this Gulliver-vs.-Lilliput battle will play out over the years. All four of these cryptocurrencies may have bright futures, but Ethereum has the clearest path to sustained success. The giant isn't even on its knees yet."

        "title": "What Is Ronin? The Ethereum Gaming Chain Behind 'Axie Infinity' and 'Pixels' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn the wide world of crypto, there are now many blockchains specifically designed for gaming\u2014but Ronin was among the first to launch.\n\nGaming blockchains are typically built to offer low transaction fees and a higher number of potential transactions, so they\u2019re supposed to be more affordable and more scalable than blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Some gaming chains are also private, meaning that developers must gain approval from a blockchain\u2019s creators in order to join its ecosystem.\n\nRonin is one of those examples\u2014at least for now, though founders have said they intend to open it up sometime in 2024 for more studios to build on. In the meantime, games like Pixels and Axie Infinity are drawing players to the Ethereum sidechain network. Here's what you need to know about it.\n\nWhat is Ronin?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRonin is a gaming-centric Ethereum sidechain designed to handle transactions at a much faster and cheaper rate than Ethereum's own mainnet. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chain originally launched back in February 2021.\n\nIt originally launched a \u201cproof of authority\u201d blockchain (PoA), meaning individuals Ronin deems reputable run validator nodes, a type of computer software, to confirm transactions on its blockchain. One common criticism of the PoA method, however, is that a lot of trust must be placed in a smaller number of validators\u2014so it\u2019s less decentralized than other methods.\n\nIn March 2022, the Ronin\u2019s bridge experienced a massive $622 million hack. The bridge connects Ronin to Ethereum. The U.S. Treasury blamed North Korean hackers for the attack\u2014and some of the lost funds were eventually recovered. Affected users were fully refunded by the Ronin network and developer Sky Mavis in June 2022.\n\nIn April 2023, the Ronin blockchain switched to the delegated proof-of-stake mechanism (DPoS), meaning that it no longer operates as a PoA blockchain. DPoS allows for more decentralization, as now any Ronin (RON) token holder with at least 250,000 RON staked on its blockchain can \u201cdelegate\u201d or select validators for the network.\n\nWhat is RON?\n\nThe Ronin token, also known as RON, is the gas token for the Ronin blockchain. Ronin network users need a bit of RON to pay for transactions on the blockchain. RON can also be staked to participate in the blockchain\u2019s aforementioned DPoS mechanism, or can be staked for other decentralized finance (DeFi) purposes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRON set an all-time high price of $4.45 in March 2024, beating the long-standing record from 2022. Ronin's token has gained substantially so far in 2024 on the back of hype around Pixels and other games launching on the network, along with a broader markets upswing led by Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is the Ronin Wallet?\n\nSky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Wallet is a crypto wallet for the Ronin blockchain ecosystem that exists as both a web browser extension and a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\nIn early 2024, the mobile wallet\u2019s developers announced new features in an effort to expand its capabilities, adding support for other blockchains like Ethereum sidechain Polygon and the EVM-compatible BNB Chain. It\u2019s also added Binance Pay as a feature, which allows users to buy some of the Ronin ecosystem's tokens.\n\nOther tokens running on Ronin include Axie Infinity's AXS governance token and Smooth Love Potion (SLP) rewards token, Pixels' PIXEL token, and Apeiron's APRS ecosystem token.\n\nWhat is Sky Mavis?\n\nSky Mavis is a crypto tech startup founded in 2018 that created both the Ronin blockchain and its flagship game, Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis has five co-founders: Trung Nguyen, Aleksander Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Viet Anh Ho Sy, and Tu Doan.\n\nAccording to Tracxn data, Sky Mavis has 26 institutional investors, with Animoca Brands and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) among them. Sky Mavis has raised $311 million in funding at time of writing, per Tracxn, with its latest round a Series B that raised $150 million in April 2022. That round was raised to help refund Ronin users after the aforementioned hack.\n\nWhich games are on Ronin?\n\nSky Mavis' own Axie Infinity launched the network, and it's a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired play-to-earn game where players can fight each other in battles where they must pit axolotl-inspired creatures called \u201cAxies\u201d against each other. Every Axie is an NFT that can be bought and sold. Thanks to a recent update, some Axies can now be upgraded, too.\n\nMore recently, Pixels has been the network's biggest hit, delivering a social farming simulation akin to Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, but with crypto incentives and NFT land plots. The game has attracted millions of players, initially fueled by its play-to-airdrop campaigns\u2014but the buzz is still going after the token launch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeyond Axie and Pixels, Sky Mavis has started to onboard other external game developers onto the Ronin blockchain, adding games like Apeiron, The Machines Arena, Kaidro, Tribesters: Island of Solas, and Civitas, to name a few. But some games have left Ronin too\u2014such as Zoids Wild Arena and Battle Bears.\n\nWhat's next for Ronin?\n\nAlong with plans to open up the network to all builders at some point, Sky Mavis has also shared how it plans to expand the network to meet future demand. In April 2024, the company detailed plans to implement zero-knowledge rollups, tapping zkEVM tech to help grow the network in the coming years.\n\nRonin will become more Ethereum aligned. We are Ethereum\u2019s best chance at onboarding everyday people. We\u2019ve been doing it for 6 years but get no recognition since we aren\u2019t a true L2 yet. We will be the #1 ETH L2 by adoption. https://t.co/ekmUWVNmfZ \u2014 Jihoz.ron (@Jihoz_Axie) April 3, 2024\n\nIn a tweet, Sky Mavis co-founder Jeff Zirlin wrote that Ronin will \"become more Ethereum-aligned\" as a result.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nThis story was originally published on January 28, 2024 and last updated with new details on April 8."

        "content": "Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen says that he\u2019s expecting Ethereum (ETH) to correct sharply to below the $1,000 level.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 790,000 YouTube subscribers that historically, ETH often \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows at least twice before moving into a new bull phase.\n\nThe analyst points out the retests of cycle lows in 2015, 2016 and 2020 and says that another low in 2022 has yet to be retested.\n\nCowen forecasts that Ethereum first breaks down in its Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) before ETH/USD follows suit, likely this year.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting is that sometime in the next few months, ETH/BTC breaks down. After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down.\n\nOne of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn\u2019t tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low. Look at all the prior examples\u2026\n\nSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\n\nIt could still take some time given these narratives that are floating around, given the spot ETF for ETH, given the halving narratives, it could take some time for that to play out.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,268.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Key Levels to Watch As Ethereum Price Sparks New Recovery at $2200 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has recently experienced an uptick in demand, particularly noticeable around the $2200 level. This change is highlighted by distinct long-tail rejection candles observed on its daily chart, indicating a decrease in bearish momentum. This shift comes in tandem with the Bitcoin price stabilization above $40000, alongside a broader uptick in altcoin markets, sparking a new relief rally.\n\nOver the past three days, the Ethereum price has seen a nearly 4% increase, now trading around the $2280 mark. Given this renewed buying pressure, can Ethereum leverage this momentum to surpass the $2500 threshold once again?\n\nadvertisement\n\nBear Trap Reboots Recovery Sentiment in ETH\n\nThe Ethereum Fear and Greed Index at 48% reflects a neutral sentiment among traders.\n\nThe $2200 support backed by several technical levels creates a stoned support region.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.3 Billion, indicating a 10.3% gain.\n\nOver the recent fortnight, the Ethereum price experienced a pronounced correction, with its value plunging from $2714 to a low of $2168, marking a significant 20% decrease. During this pullback, the coin price broke below the channel pattern\u2019s support trendline, which underpinned a recovery rally for nearly three months.\n\nHowever, as the broader market\u2019s bearish momentum began to fade, the ETH price demonstrated resilience around the $2200 mark, successfully reclaiming the previously breached support trendline. This reversal marked the prior downfall as a \u2018Bear Trap,\u2019 and triggered additional buying orders in the market, evidenced by considerable short liquidation.\n\nCurrently trading at $2280, if Ethereum can maintain its position above this reclaimed support, it could initiate a 6.85% relief rally, aiming for the $2430 level. This immediate resistance aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, highlighting a pivotal barrier that sellers are likely to defend vigorously.\n\nTherefore, for Ether to continue its upward trajectory and potentially retest the $2700 mark, a breakout above this critical resistance level is essential to gain further momentum.\n\nHas Ethereum Price Entered Downtrend Momentum?\n\nExamining Ethereum\u2019s daily time frame chart, it\u2019s evident that corrections are a regular occurrence. In November 2023, the cryptocurrency underwent a 38.2% correction, followed by a 23.6% retracement in December 2023. Such trends suggest that these retracements, particularly around the 38.2% Fibonacci level, are typical for Ether, often serving as a precursor to subsequent upward movements.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): Amid the recent downturn, the 100-day EMA slope at $2200 showcased its sustainability as valid pullback support.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The daily RSI slope below 45% reflects the market sentiment currently bearish.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "History was made on Saturday when the first ever loan against a domain name was executed with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The significance is that the success marks the birth of a new asset class that can be leveraged to unlock capital for business owners or domain name investors in an expeditious and secure manner.\n\ndeBanked founder Sean Murray was the executor of the transaction. The process involved tokenizing a domain name (domainfi.net) into an NFT and then offering that NFT as collateral on an NFT loan marketplace. When a loan was executed on the platform with a smart contract, the domain name was automatically placed into an ethereum address to be held as escrow. If the borrower were to default on the loan, the smart contract would automatically release the domain name to the lender, who would now have full control of it.\n\nThe process involved two parties, the tokenizing registrar and the NFT loan marketplace. The loan, which was consummated for proof of concept, carried a 10% APY and a 7-day term. It took less than 20 minutes combined to complete the tokenization and loan execution process.\n\n\u201cI was guessing that this capability might still be another year away and I had not even dreamed that I would be the very first one to execute this type of loan,\u201d said Murray. \u201cFollowing this space closely probably contributed to that stroke of luck. There is still time until this is ready to be a consumer-facing product in the marketplace, but the tech already exists and transactions of this nature are already viable. It will be fascinating to watch.\u201d\n\nAbout deBanked\n\ndeBanked was launched in 2010.

        "content": "U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, (ETH) has found itself under the scrutiny of analysts as the digital asset hovers around crucial price levels. A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights, asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2,130, with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2,500.\n\nAs of the latest market data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,262, reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days, showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours, reaching $9,626,210,522, indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.\n\nCrypto Tony's emphasis on the $2,130 and $2,500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts, who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.\n\nPotential bullish catalyst\n\nIn a related development, the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade, known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade. This imminent update has generated considerable buzz within the Ethereum community, as it promises substantial enhancements and alterations to the platform. The Prague upgrade is anticipated to introduce improvements in scalability, security and overall functionality, which could positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory.\n\nThe potential bullish effect of the Prague upgrade on ETH's value has sparked discussions among investors and analysts, with some speculating that the impending changes could serve as a catalyst for a price surge, propelling Ethereum above current levels.\n\nWhile the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, the confluence of technical analysis highlighting key price levels and the anticipation of a major network upgrade contributes to the growing intrigue surrounding Ethereum's future price movements. Market participants are closely monitoring the developments, ready to capitalize on potential opportunities as ETH navigates these crucial junctures in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Shapella hard fork was a controversial upgrade that ignited fears of selling pressure. But the latest data tells a different story.\n\nIn January 2024, Intotheblock\u2019s data revealed the highest Ethereum staking rate, reaching approximately 30 million ETH staked, accompanied by a staking participation rate of over 24%. This milestone suggested a preference for staking over promptly selling off tokens.\n\nEthereum locked-in staking keeps surging, while only 11% of the token supply is currently stored on centralized exchanges.\n\nAnalyzing the latest figures, it\u2019s evident that the much-talked-about Ethereum upgrade, Shapella \u2013 enabling stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 \u2013 did not lead to the widespread unstaking as initially predicted.\n\nEven with the introduction of the new feature enabling stakers to retrieve their tokens, the current staked amount stands at 29.13 million ETH, accounting for 24.2% of the total supply.\n\nAccording to @intotheblock January 2024 witnessed the highest eth staking rate with about 29,128,513.51 ETH staked and a staking participation rate of 24.29%.https://t.co/9ZAwSxhUZm pic.twitter.com/7327HLpUcH \u2014 champagne mami \ud83d\udc95 (@EkponoAkwaowo) January 24, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum staking rate is a metric composed of two components \u2013 rewards for consensus layer duties and priority transaction fees.\n\nThe rewards are guided by Ethereum\u2019s transparent \u201cmonetary policy,\u201d adapting based on the total staked ETH, prioritizing security. The transaction fees, on the other hand, are influenced by the demand on the Ethereum network, typically rising when new information or opportunities emerge.\n\nAs such, expanding the user base and use cases for Ethereum\u2019s staking rate is crucial for enhancing network security, attracting new investments in ether, and establishing connections between digital assets and traditional finance."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency's supporters are hoping this is just the beginning of a long-running bull market.\n\nAfter tanking 68% in 2022, Ethereum (ETH -1.01%) experienced a resurgence last year, as the digital asset soared 91% in 2023. This was on the back of renewed optimism in the crypto industry.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains 49% off its all-time high. And the current dip might be a rare opportunity.\n\nShould investors buy this leading cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,500? Let's look at both the bull and bear cases for Ethereum, so that investors can make an informed decision.\n\nWhat the bulls are saying\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency that incorporated functionality for smart contracts. And this means that it had greater potential to introduce various use cases.\n\nThis includes decentralized applications, in verticals including gaming, social, governance, and even art. But one area that has huge potential is decentralized finance (DeFi). According to coinmarketcap.com, Ethereum has 71% of the $105 billion of total value locked in the entire cryptocurrency industry. This metric measures how much capital is staked or locked up in DeFi applications, indicating Ethereum's dominance.\n\nIn September 2022, Ethereum's network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Supporters had long waited for this upgrade, called The Merge, to make the cryptocurrency better capable of scaling up. This also reduced its energy usage by 99.95%. Furthermore, the hope is that Ethereum can process more transactions at lower costs. And this should continue to make this blockchain network a hotbed when it comes to developer activity.\n\nAnother reason why Ethereum might be on your investing radar has to do with the potential for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hit the market. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin spot ETFs recently, and there's optimism this could happen with Ethereum as well. So far, BlackRock and Ark Invest, among other asset managers, have filed applications. This could bring in massive amounts of institutional capital to Ethereum, which could support a higher price over time.\n\nThe bears have compelling arguments\n\nThe entire premise of cryptocurrencies is to take power away from central authorities and give it to the community. The goal is to create decentralized networks where individuals are in control. The issue with Ethereum, though, is that it's still controlled by a small group of people. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has an outsize influence on the direction of the crypto. Some might view this as a huge risk because he can take actions that are more favorable to himself.\n\nBesides The Merge, Ethereum's leaders have a comprehensive roadmap that includes numerous other upgrades to the network, called the Surge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. While this is encouraging, because it shows how well thought out Ethereum's development pipeline is, it adds tremendous technical risk. Anytime software is changed, a lot can go wrong, thus opening up Ethereum to software bugs that could make it easier for hackers to attack the network and steal people's private keys.\n\nInvestors also can't ignore regulatory concerns. SEC chair Gary Gensler has come out and said before that he views Bitcoin as a commodity, while all other cryptocurrencies are likely securities. This means Ethereum could face a more stringent regulatory framework going forward, which could discourage capital and talent from migrating to it.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum? It depends.\n\n\n\nBoth the bull and bear cases hold a lot of weight. Investors should consider the facts and come to their own conclusion about what to do with this cryptocurrency as it relates to their portfolio composition. Everyone has a different perspective.\n\nIf you're willing to take the risk, accept the uncertainty, and understand that there will be lots of volatility, then initiating a tiny position in Ethereum while it's still below $2,500 might make sense. Of course, it's critical to maintain a long-term mindset of at least five to 10 years if you go this route."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) had depressing week after the historic approval and trading of several crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap plunged hard on Monday following a sell-off from digital asset fund manager Grayscale. The virtual coin dropped below $40,000 (to $38,678) on Tuesday, but slowly recovered as the week went on.\n\nIt is now trading for $41,830, CoinGecko data shows, a less than 1% movement over seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF started trading, it had operated like a closed-end fund where investors could not redeem their shares for BTC. However, following its conversion and subsequent trading, investors started to cash out quickly.\n\nThis led Grayscale to send huge amounts of the cryptocurrency to its custodian, Coinbase, leading to pressure on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off slowed towards the end of the week\u2014likely leading to the rebound in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though: Analysts told Decrypt that Bitcoin \u201ccould see increased appeal\u201d in 2024\u2014if the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut BTC\u2019s plunge in the week hit the wider crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) was a big loser, dropping to $2,186 on Tuesday and never really recovering, logging an 8% loss over the week. It\u2019s now trading for $2,264.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts drop came following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision to delay ETH ETF proposals from both BlackRock and Grayscale.\n\nElsewhere, Solana (SOL) took a beating. It was, at the start of the week, one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies. It has since picked up and is trading for $92.60, a more than 1% seven-day rise.\n\nWhile Dogecoin (DOGE)\u2014the original meme coin and 11th biggest cryptocurrency\u2014pumped at the start of the week over speculation that it might be used for payments on Twitter, it slowly drifted back to where it started. It kicked off the week at $0.08, and is back at the same spot as of writing.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Experts turn their attention to Spot Ethereum ETF: Will Ethereum Classic and NuggetRush benefit again? - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "TLDR:\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is now the strongest narrative in the crypto community.\n\nEthereum Classic is one of the top altcoins looking to rally off a potential approval.\n\nFollowing its 80% increase, NuggetRush could jump 25x after a spot ETF approval.\n\nAlthough the ETF impact on crypto prices has predominantly been negative in the first two weeks, the crypto market has turned its attention to a spot Ethereum ETF. According to recent reports, there are seven ETFs for Ethereum waiting to be approved.\n\nIn other news, Ethereum Classic (ETC) benefited from the last ETH rally and will be looking to extend its gains. Meanwhile, NuggetRush has already yielded gains of more than 80% as investors show support for its impact gaming model.\n\nA Spot Ethereum (ETF) is closer than first expected\n\nMany analysts predicted that it would take a while for Ethereum to get its own spot ETF after the SEC decision on Bitcoin ETF was announced on January 11. However, it is now certain that an ETH spot ETF will be approved soon.\n\nAccording to a recent report, there are seven filings for a spot Ethereum ETF waiting for approval. These applications are from VanEck, Ark Invest, Fidelity, iShares, Grayscale, Invesco, and Hasdex. The SEC has issued deadlines between May and August for these products.\n\nThe Kaiko Research team has reported that approval is the biggest narrative in the crypto space. This is because, unlike Bitcoin, a market rally is expected for Ethereum. Many experts expect the price of ETH to surpass $5,000 before the year ends.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) forms pattern for parabolic rise in 2024\n\nDuring the recent bear market, NuggetRush (NUGX) is one of the best altcoins that remained bullish. In the last few weeks, its price has increased by 80% as NUGX set a new high at $0.018. The massive support for the impact gaming model of NuggetRush has fueled this rally and helped set the ground for a major NUGX rally in 2024.\n\nNuggetRush has created a very cool game that offers a unique play-to-earn (P2E) experience. In this game, players can win gold and NFT rewards by participating in mining challenges. There are multiple landscapes covered in resources like gold that players can mine and earn rewards for themselves.\n\nThe game is designed to be challenging, with players competing against each other to build the largest mining operation. However, NuggetRush stands out as one of the top DeFi projects in its social impact.\n\nAs players earn, a portion of the rewards are sent to artisanal miners in underdeveloped regions. This unique gaming model has set NuggetRush apart from the competition. This is why market experts believe its ERC20 coin, NUGX, could soar by 50x in 2024.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) set to benefit from a SEC approval\n\nWhen the crypto market was bullish in anticipation of Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was one of the biggest gainers. Outperforming ETH, the price of Ethereum Classic jumped by more than 50% to set a 2024 high at $32.00.\n\nAlthough the price of ETC has retraced along with the crypto market, there are still high expectations for Ethereum Classic. Many experts have bullish predictions for ETC because it has become a refuge for PoW miners seeking Ethereum features.\n\nThe network also performed a major upgrade to help Ethereum Classic maintain protocol parity with Ethereum. According to Finbold, Ethereum Classic could rally from $23.00 to $100.00 in 2024, making it one of the best altcoins to buy.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF has become a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community, and for good reason. With approval, we could see a potential rally for ETC while NuggetRush continues to dominate the GameFi sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts : All You Need To Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum stands as a decentralized blockchain platform driven by the Ether token, offering users a versatile range of capabilities. From facilitating transactions to playing games, engaging in cryptocurrency trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs) earning interest through staking, and even participating in social media activities, the platform presents a comprehensive ecosystem.\n\nMany envision Ethereum as the natural progression of the internet. While centralized platforms like Apple\u2019s App Store embody the era of Web 2.0, Ethereum represents the dawn of Web 3.0\u2014a decentralized, community-driven network. This new phase in internet evolution supports decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It\u2019s crucial to note that Ether, not Ethereum, is the designated crypto unit.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNow, let\u2019s unravel some lesser-known facts that add intriguing dimensions to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum takes a different stance on token supply. With over 120 million its tokens circulating, a stark contrast emerges\u2014over ten times more tokens than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by its approaching finite supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum follows a different trajectory, emphasizing abundance over scarcity.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s imminent scarcity pushes its value higher and poses challclassicenges to mining. The philosophy is straightforward: fewer coins available often translate to higher cryptocurrency value. Once a cryptocurrency reaches its maximum supply, mining stops, and market dynamics revolve around supply and demand.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum doesn\u2019t impose a fixed supply cap. Instead, it employs a mechanism called \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d to manage Ether\u2019s inflation rate, ensuring network security and motivating validators.\n\nThe platform\u2019s issuance rate undergoes adjustments through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and community consensus. Diverging from Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap, it introduces a flexible approach, allowing for ongoing adjustments to maintain balance within the network. Notably, EIP-1559 introduces a deflationary element by burning a portion of ETH as a base fee, contributing to the evolving economic dynamics of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Narrative\n\nThe Ethereum community faced a seismic event in 2015\u2014the DAO hack, resulting in a substantial loss of $150 million worth of tokens. To salvage Ethereum from the brink of collapse, a consequential decision was made: a hard fork. However, a faction within the community, guided by the principle of \u201cCode is law,\u201d opted to adhere to the original code. This pivotal moment birthed two chains\u2014the forked chain retaining the name Ethereum, and the original chain christened Ethereum Classic, which continues to follow the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, preserving the ethos of the original code.\n\nThe Genesis: Birth and Philosophy\n\nEthereum\u2019s beginnings trace back to 2013, involving a collective effort by eight individuals, including the visionary Vitalik Buterin, who crafted the coin (ETH) in Switzerland. With its official launch in 2015, Ethereum\u2019s origin story bears the imprint of Buterin\u2019s dissatisfaction with centralized services\u2014a sentiment molded by his experiences in the world of World of Warcraft. This critical perspective formed the philosophical foundation of Ethereum, steering its path toward decentralization.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to avoid confusion between Ethereum and Ether. Ether, the native token, serves as a virtual coin within the Ethereum network, much like other digital currencies. Beyond being a tradable asset, Ether plays various roles\u2014it is used for transactions, runs applications within the Ethereum network, and serves as a means to monetize activities conducted on the platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s move towards Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn the early days, both Bitcoin and Ethereum relied on a process called \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW), where individuals could mine new tokens by validating blockchain transactions on their personal computers. However, in September 2022, Ethereum (ETH) underwent a significant transformation, moving away from PoW to embrace Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder PoS, new coins are created when crypto owners \u201cstake\u201d their own coins, essentially locking them up to participate in transaction verification and, consequently, earn rewards. While this method was already employed by Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), Ether swiftly ascended to become the leading cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.\n\nThe primary motivation behind this shift lies in energy efficiency. The energy consumption associated with Ethereum transactions was staggering, equating to over 100,000 VISA transactions in December 2021. However, post the Ethereum Merge, the energy footprint notably decreased. Observers believe that this change not only influences public perceptions of cryptocurrencies but also holds implications for the future development of popular decentralized finance (DeFi) categories within Ethereum, such as crypto lending.\n\nExploring Alternatives to \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d\n\nEthereum encountered a pivotal moment known as the \u201cSplit,\u201d sparking a quest for alternatives to the traditional \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW) model. As some enthusiasts applaud the reduction in energy costs, not all its formerminers welcomed the Merge, a transition away from the PoW model.\n\nIn September 2022, a revealing graphic displayed a substantial dump of Ethereum (ETH) by miners holding blockchain addresses linked to their mining activities. Expecting a price surge post-Merge, these miners were disappointed, leading to the selling of their ETH holdings.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed a surge in transaction counts, reaching approximately 1.1 million per day in September 2022. This uptick in activity coincided with the aftermath of the Merge and the subsequent dissatisfaction among miners. The dissatisfaction prompted a significant number of miners to part ways, seeking alternative cryptocurrencies for their mining endeavors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Crowdfunding\n\nEthereum\u2019s inception traces back to a community-driven initiative, spearheaded by its creator, Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, Buterin conceived the idea of decentralized blockchain platform, inspired by a sense of dissatisfaction with the limitations he observed in Bitcoin. His vision extended beyond the constraints of existing blockchain technology, aiming to create a platform capable of supporting intricate and diverse applications.\n\nIn 2014, he initiated a community-backed fundraising effort, selling the initial batch of Ethereum tokens known as Ether (ETH) to the public. This crowdfunding campaign marked a significant milestone, surpassing expectations and raising over $18 million in just 42 days. Notably, this successful endeavour propelled the blockchain into the ranks of the first and largest crowdfunded projects in history.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began not only as a technological innovation but as a testament to the power of community support, illustrating how collaborative efforts can pave the way for ground breaking projects in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nBonus: Ethereum\u2019s Growing Influence in Tech Boardrooms\n\nBeyond the realm of developers and investors, Ethereum has captured the attention of major corporations. Giants like Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Intel, and Amazon are exploring itspotential solutions. Enterprise software companies, including IBM and Deloitte, are testing the platform\u2019s networks, signaling a broader acceptance of blockchain technology in corporate landscapes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain, Ethereum stands as a pioneer, symbolizing innovation, adaptability, and community-driven progress. Beyond its decentralized framework, the popular platform embodies the essence of Web 3.0, ushering in a new era of user empowerment. From token dynamics to the Proof-of-Stake transition and corporate intrigue, Ethereum\u2019s journey reflects a dynamic intersection of technological evolution and philosophical principles. As it charts the course for decentralized possibilities, it serves as a testament to collective spirit in advancing blockchain technology."

This upcoming update is called the Prague upgrade, also referred to as the Pectra upgrade, and has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community.\n\nTestnets are essential staging grounds for new features, and the Dencun upgrade will first roll out across several testnets: Goerli on Jan. 17, Sepolia on Jan. 30 and Holesky on Feb. 7, 2024. These testnets will allow developers to fine-tune the upgrade in a controlled environment, ensuring everything operates smoothly before going live on the main network.\n\nSource: Tim Beiko on Ethereum MagiciansThe core development team is currently in a debate over prioritizing the implementation of Verkle trees, a data structure that would optimize storage and access to information on Ethereum. While some developers advocate making Verkle trees the sole focus, others suggest pursuing a smaller feature fork alongside the Verkle development.\n\nThe main argument for concentrating solely on Verkle trees stems from their complexity and the time investment needed to implement them effectively. This could mean that if Verkle trees become the next priority, no new execution layer (EL) features might appear for 12 to 24 months, or possibly longer.\n\nNevertheless, there is an understanding that even if the focus shifts to Verkle trees, minor updates to the Ethereum Layer (EL) might still be necessary. For example, changes to the gas limit for data availability are crucial for Ethereum's scaling solutions and require coordination across both the execution layer and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nThe Prague upgrade is set to include various proposals that aim to refine the Ethereum platform on different layers, including precompiles for specific cryptographic operations, a new EVM object format (EOF) and modifications to smart contract capabilities.\n\nThe Prague upgrade promises to be a significant event that will shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. It is a step forward in ensuring that Ethereum continues to offer a secure, efficient and scalable platform for decentralized applications.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) performance against Bitcoin (BTC) is a leading indicator of market cycles and an altseason. Thus, cryptocurrency traders and investors constantly monitor the ETH/BTC pair for valuable insights.\n\nIn particular, the well-known CrediBULL Crypto has his eyes turned to this pair and warns of a possible Ethereum sell-off. According to him, Ethereum has found a local top against Bitcoin in an expected deviation above previous highs.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto posted this analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on January 25, quoting a previous post where he forecasted the deviation, as happened.\n\nBoom. Beautiful rejection on ETH/BTC as expected. May revisit those local highs but imo a full retrace of ETH/BTC is on the horizon as $BTC recovers from this recent correction and begins it's next impulsive move to the upside, outperforming ETH once again.\n\n\n\nAs I have said before\u2026 https://t.co/HllnRI4Pee pic.twitter.com/uiOqcVvRBO \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nETH/BTC analysis\n\nNotably, the trader points to a breakout from the current support line at 0.04905 BTC per Ethereum. Furthermore, ETH/BTC should continue its downfall through 0.04624 BTC straight to a range below 0.03800 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: CrediBULL Crypto\n\nCrediBULL Crypto explained ETH/BTC will only find a bottom once Bitcoin makes a new all-time high. Therefore, investors must be aware of \u201cany bounces before that,\u201d as they will most likely fade away, in his words.\n\nSince posting, Bitcoin has already outperformed Ethereum by around 2%, validating the above analysis. However, the economic context is a key factor to consider. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything could change swiftly.\n\nOn the other hand, institutional investors are turning to Ethereum and showing support for altcoins and tokenization. Recently, Franklin Templeton backed ETH, SOL, and other cryptocurrencies focused on utility. In the meantime, BlackRock\u2019s CEO shared his vision of tokenization while talking about an expected Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nAll things considered, it is possible that the ETH/BTC pair surprise technical analysts in the near future, depending on further developments involving institutions and the regulatory landscape. Investors must trade cautiously, keeping themselves updated on the adoption and demand for Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
