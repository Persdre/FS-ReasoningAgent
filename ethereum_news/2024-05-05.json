        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Cofounder Says SEC Is \u2018Gaslighting\u2019 Everyone About Crypto - WIRED",
        "content": "Joe Lubin is in a fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Not only is the financial regulator waging war against Ethereum, he claims, but making a grab for jurisdiction over the future of the Internet. So Lubin has decided to punch back.\n\nIn 2015, Lubin was part of the team that created Ethereum, the computer network home to the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, known as ETH. Later that year, Lubin founded Consensys, with the loose ambition to support the development and adoption of Ethereum and built software products on top of the network. In April, Consensys received an unwelcome missive\u2014known as a Wells Notice\u2014from the SEC, informing the company that it was about to be sued. The regulator\u2019s grievance, Consensys was told, had to do with one of the software products in its stable: MetaMask, a crypto wallet that lets users store crypto coins and interact with Ethereum-based apps.\n\nConsensys claims that the SEC notice, which has not been made public, states that MetaMask has made the company into an unregistered securities broker. Specifically, the SEC takes issue with two MetaMask features: one that allows users to trade between different tokens and another that lets them lock up their tokens in exchange for a regular reward, in a process called staking.\n\nOn April 25, Consensys filed a lawsuit of its own against the SEC. The complaint accuses the regulator of an \u201cunlawful seizure of authority over ETH,\u201d which \u201cbears none of the attributes of a security\u201d\u2014the specific type of financial instrument over which the SEC has dominion. The SEC having its way \u201cwould spell disaster for the Ethereum network,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nIn its Wells Notice, the SEC stopped short of calling ETH itself a security, says Consensys, focusing instead on the MetaMask features. But according to Consensys, the agency has long been quietly conducting an investigation into Ethereum, in the view that ETH should be reclassified as such.\n\nThat\u2019s not fair, claims Consensys, because an SEC director has previously described ETH as a commodity, not a security, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a separate US financial regulator, has made the same contention. \u201cConsensys built its business against the backdrop of this regulatory consensus,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIn bringing the lawsuit, Consensys hopes to drag itself and Ethereum out from underneath the SEC, by clarifying the limits of its jurisdiction, and embolden the rest of the crypto industry to retaliate against what it describes as \u201caggressive and unlawful SEC overreach.\u201d An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the specific allegations made by Consensys, saying only that \u201cnoncompliance with the securities laws deprives investors of critical protections, including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosures, segregation of customer assets, safeguards against conflicts of interest, oversight by a self-regulatory organization, and routine inspection by the SEC. It\u2019s investors who get hurt and the American financial markets that may suffer.\u201d\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for brevity and clarity."

        "content": "Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) prices have historically proven very volatile. It's not uncommon to see its value double or triple in a matter of months. In other months, however, its price has been cut in half or worse.\n\nBut what about the long term? If you had invested $300 into Ethereum five years ago, and held on, you'd likely be very pleased with the outcome.\n\nHow profitable has Ethereum been over the last five years?\n\nIf you had put $300 into Ethereum five years ago, you'd have roughly $5,600 today. That's a 1,770% return, even higher than Bitcoin's 1,000% performance over the same period. The S&P 500, for comparison, increased in value by just 87%.\n\nBut before you jump in and buy Ethereum, there are a few important caveats to note.\n\nFirst, Ethereum was still a young, relatively unknown technology five years ago. The crypto industry has come a long way since then, with far greater utility, adoption, and recognition. It's possible that Ethereum's biggest days of growth are behind it.\n\nSecond, these eye-popping returns were only accrued by investors with so-called diamond hands -- that's crypto terminology for holding tight through extreme ups and downs. If you purchased Ethereum five years ago only to sell it at the start of 2023, for example, you'd only be sitting on a 640% gain. That's still impressive, but far less than what patient investors have earned. Conversely, if you purchased Ethereum at the start of 2022 only to sell one year later, you would have lost two-thirds of your original investment!\n\nEthereum has proven a terrific long term investment, but its short term movements are difficult to predict.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ethereum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ethereum wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $544,015!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "When Ethereum was conceived in 2013, little did we know that it would become the center of attraction and rally competitors in the crypto space.\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, what about gas fees? Scalability? Network? Competition? Nothing can stop an ETH Maxi from vehemently pushing the narrative of the first-ever smart contract blockchain layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn every crypto ecosystem, some undeterred believers passionately promote their native token or cryptocurrency to the masses. Nonetheless, the limitation of the currency or the presence of a better alternative; these influencers are the mainstay.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom building DeFi to establishing the fortress for Web3, to its transition to Proof of Stake, Ethereum has proven to be a blockchain flexible enough to adapt and perhaps the only true competitor to Bitcoin. Every other chain either measures itself against Ethereum, builds on top of it (as Layer 2 solutions), or claims to be the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d\u2014a classic anecdote for the crypto saga.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, ETH thought leaders will always remain steadfast. So if you\u2019re here looking for the most influential Ethereum influencers to follow and keep an eye on their updates, you\u2019ve come to the right article.\n\nWho Are Crypto Influencers?\n\nWhether you call them Maxis, Thought Leaders, or KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders), this group of crypto personalities advocates for everything related to cryptocurrency and the blockchain industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir responsibilities go beyond merely owning a social media account with a substantial number of followers.

Keeping track of influencers provides a glimmer of hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum offers numerous opportunities in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. It is the foundation for other blockchains that leverage its layer to create more sustainable networks, enhancing the overall user experience. While most ETH enthusiasts are open to sharing knowledge, there are a few narcissistic territorial maxis who might be an exception.\n\nBest Ethereum Influencers to Follow on Social Media in 2024\n\nInfluencers wield their influence primarily on social media platforms. Several platforms exist where these influencers keep their followers and members of the crypto community informed about the cryptocurrency market.

Following him will keep you informed about the latest developments in the crypto world.\n\nPros and Cons of Following Ethereum Influencers\n\nIt is not recommended to take every word from an influencer\u2019s tweets on social media or a podcast and digest them hook, line, and sinker. Just like everything else that exists, there are perks and drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand their influential materials, you must learn to differentiate what works from what doesn\u2019t.\n\nPros\n\nReliable Sources: These influencers are often the most reliable references to turn to when you encounter random news about Ethereum. They commit themselves to being the avenue through which others stay updated on recent events in the space. Spreading false information would only tarnish their reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Up to Date: When Bitcoin ETFs were under consideration by the SEC, those following BTC maximalists were continuously kept informed about the proceedings. Ethereum ETFs have also been hinted to arrive soon. Can you guess where you\u2019ll find this information? Exactly\u2014ETH maximalists.\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-Time Information: Influencers provide real-time updates on various aspects: market volatility, trends, legal challenges, crypto-government conflicts, recent launches, upcoming airdrops, and more. No one reports it better than these maximalists.\n\n\n\nDeep Insights and Content on Cryptocurrency: First, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) are the go-to sources for news, updates, and events. But beyond that, they analyze these developments and share market sentiments through various mediums such as social media posts, YouTube videos, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), and blogs. KOLs engage in fact-based speculations, discussions, and provide expert opinions.\n\nCons\n\nInformation Overload: Someone needs to tell influencers to cut us some slack. There are too many influencers, each sharing their individual opinions. It\u2019s overwhelming to take in and comprehend all the updates, analyses, and news that come in droves. We have too little time to make sense of it all.\n\n\n\nMisinformation: Having influence doesn\u2019t guarantee that their content is always accurate, especially for those who are not part of the Ethereum team. To avoid this, follow reputable sources like Vitalik and steer clear of influential farmers.\n\n\n\nMarket Influence and Bias: Predictions and analyses by Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) can sometimes be wrong. KOLs are not supreme beings with the ability to control the market through their thoughts. Instead, they use sentiments to sway their audience. Occasionally, they spread hate or bias toward other opinions or chains, subtly influencing their followers.\n\n\n\n**False Hope:**Being bullish is fine, but delivering doses of \u2018hopium\u2019 to susceptible followers who hang on your every word goes against crypto principles. However, for many ETH maximalists, the hype should remain alive.\n\n\n\nEnd Words\n\nEthereum is the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin and the most actively engaged blockchain in the history of distributed ledgers. This prominence places the pioneer smart contract network at the center of numerous discussions within the crypto space.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing criticisms, making comparisons, and staying updated all require experts who can readily highlight and clarify complex topics. Their insights help followers make informed decisions and take enlightened steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that the term \u2018influencer\u2019 doesn\u2019t imply blindly following their investment advice. While influencers play a valuable role, you should never let them entirely dictate your crypto investment decisions. There will always be digital currencies, NFTs to explore, bridges to test, and DeFi projects to consider. But don\u2019t rush into decisions solely because an influencer recommends it. Instead, make your own choices, build a solid rationale, and remember the crypto mantra: DYOR (Do Your Own Research).\n\nFAQs\n\nWho are the best ETH influencers? Vitalik Buterin and every other dedicated Ethereum supporter on social media have everyone\u2019s interests at heart. They are undoubtedly crypto influencers too.\n\n\n\nWill $ETH supersede $BTC? Crypto remains uncertain, leaving room for possibilities. However, $BTC stands strong as the pioneer of crypto, making it challenging for other cryptocurrencies to surpass it.\n\nFrom every perspective, Ethereum\u2019s goal is not to replace Bitcoin but to serve as the decentralized open-source smart contract layer for applications to build upon.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct competition between $BTC and $ETH\u2014only mutual respect (except for the maximalists who might think otherwise).\n\n\n\nWhat impact will the launch of more \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d have on Ethereum? From my viewpoint, it won\u2019t have a significant impact. Ethereum will continue to thrive. The crypto space operates as an open-source collaborative environment.\n\nEthereum will persistently evolve, while other blockchains may create forks. In the end, survival will favor those who adapt.\n\n\n\nWill the growth of other cryptocurrencies affect the future of the Ethereum Blockchain? Ethereum proudly remains the mother of smart contracts. Most ecosystems either build on it, adopt its architecture, or strive to provide better scalability. Therefore, the growth of these projects cannot undermine ETH, as it plays a crucial role in the crypto industry.\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "How much could Ethereum be worth in the near future? One cryptocurrency expert makes a bullish prediction. - KTVZ",
        "content": "\n\nleksiv // Shutterstock\n\nHow much could Ethereum be worth in the near future? One cryptocurrency expert makes a bullish prediction.\n\nSilver ethereum coin with conceptual finance chart in background.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has made headlines in 2024 with the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming halving, Benzinga looks into how Ethereum (ETH) is potentially positioned to make waves in the coming months and years, according to Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood.\n\nArk Invest held its Big Ideas event, an annual opportunity to review high-level market trends and potentially disruptive technologies. At one of these events, Wood asserted that Ethereum could reach a market capitalization of $20 trillion by 2032.\n\nThe current market cap of ETH is around $400 billion and has approached $500 billion in 2024. The market cap of the S&P 500 is around $40 trillion to $45 trillion. If ETH were to amass a market capitalization of $20 trillion, the price per token would be around $166,000.\n\nThe Ark Invest CEO believes the mainstream adoption of ETH as a financial tool will be the main catalyst for this price prediction. Ethereum is a way for people to access decentralized finance applications. The applications allow anyone to interact with different financial actions, such as trading, lending, borrowing and staking, without going through a centralized intermediary. If these applications are adopted on a large scale, the demand for ETH \u2014 and its price \u2014 could increase.\n\nTalks of spot Ethereum ETFs are ongoing. Releasing the ETFs could have an impact similar to that of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which brought in huge amounts of inflows and propelled the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nBut potential ETF sponsors face several regulatory hurdles, particularly related to the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) classification of ETH as a security rather than a commodity as BTC was classified. Despite this, some are still confident that ETH ETFs could come as soon as this year, which could positively affect the price of Ethereum.\n\nWood is known for making extraordinary predictions about tokens well into the future. For example, at Bitcoin Investor Day in March, she predicted that Bitcoin would reach a high of $3.8 million by 2030. While these predictions may have some merit, they are largely speculative and may be influenced by Ark\u2019s entanglement with the assets. The company was one of several that released a spot Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and also offers an Ethereum futures ETF (ARKZ). So, Wood could be giving these predictions as a way to increase engagement with her firm\u2019s products.\n\nIf ETH reaches $166,000 per token by 2030, it would create huge gains. Specifically, an investment of $1,000 would be worth $54,330. An investment of $10,000 would be worth $543,300. These huge profits may not come to fruition, but according to Wood, they are a possibility.\n\nThis story was produced by Benzinga and reviewed and distributed by Stacker Media."

        "title": "Can Tron Overtake Ethereum? - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nTron: Huge in Asian markets despite regulatory scrutiny, powered by Tether.\n\nEthereum: Favored in Western markets for its compliance and innovation, powered by USDC.\n\nEthereum has a higher market capitalization, while Tron sees greater daily user activity, suggesting different levels of market engagement.\n\nThe potential outcomes for Ethereum and Tron range from one dominating the market, both coexisting, or both being overtaken by a new blockchain.\n\nBefore the advent of radar and satellite navigation, sailors often relied on the flight of birds to determine the presence of nearby land masses. Similarly, in the blockchain markets, the \u201cflight patterns\u201d of stablecoins can often tell you quite a lot about the fortunes of a blockchain project.\n\nAs of this writing, Tron is leading Ethereum in USDT supply, with $57 billion on Tron versus $50 billion on Ethereum. What might this mean for blockchain investors? Can Tron overtake its older, more popular rival as the premier Layer-1 smart contract blockchain?\n\nIn short, which token is the better buy in the long term \u2013 ETH or TRX?\n\nIn this guide, we analyze the fundamentals, history, and regional dynamics of both Tron and Ethereum to see if we can find a winner.\n\nThe Fundamentals\n\nBehind bitcoin, Ethereum is the second largest crypto in the world, with a market cap of $386 billion. At just $10.6 billion, Tron is a distant 13th on the table overall (and 9th if you only look at L1 blockchains). Bitcoin towers above them all, with a market cap of $1.24 trillion.\n\nToken Price and Supply\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was worth $3,169, an increase of 178% year over year and 1557% from its value in Q4 2020. Naturally, this price movement has made ETH a popular option among investors for long-term holding.\n\nTRX presents a study in contrast in many ways. Since its launch in 2017, the token has never ventured above a peak of $0.23 in price. At the start of Q2 2024, 1 TRX is worth $0.120, a 6000% increase since 2017 and 173% year-on-year.\n\nBoth ETH and TRX do not have any limits on the number of tokens that can be issued over time. In both blockchains, a set amount of tokens are regularly burnt off to regulate the available supply and maintain an upward price pressure.\n\nDaily Active Users\n\nOn Daily Active Users, our favorite metric, Tron is comfortably ahead of its rivals. The network has around 1.9 million daily users. After crossing the one million milestone in 2022, the numbers have remained relatively stable, with noticeable spikes in 2023 and early 2024.\n\nOn Ethereum, the number of daily active users is only around 465,000. The graph looks relatively flat over the years, barring a few minor spikes here and there. Although there is a slow upward trend, it is pretty clear that holders of ETH typically use the network less often than TRX owners.\n\nNetwork Fees\n\nHigh gas fees have been a perennial problem for the Ethereum network. This has spawned the development of Layer-2 networks (L2s) and sidechains prioritizing lower transaction costs. L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism and sidechains like Polygon offer lower gas fees than the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nEven in 2024, subject to network congestion and demand, gas fees on ETH mainnet can range from less than a dollar to $70 or more. In contrast, transactions on the Tron network usually cost between $1 - $3, subject to network activity.\n\nFurther, Tron also offers free transactions. Users willing to stake TRX on the network can enjoy transactions without gas fees. The limits can vary depending on the quantity of TRX staked.\n\nIn 2024, Ethereum's annualized fees were around $2.75 billion, with a monthly fee of $226 million. Meanwhile, Tron reported annualized costs of $1.52 billion and monthly fees of $125 million.\n\nReputation and Regional Dynamics\n\nAny discussion of the Tron network would be futile without a look at its controversial founder, Justin Sun. A fugitive from the Chinese government, Sun has been accused of everything from insider trading to market making, tax evasion, various forms of financial fraud, money laundering, and more.\n\nEven sections of the Tron white paper were allegedly plagiarized from white papers written by Protocol Labs, another blockchain organization. Sun, who owns the Tron Foundation, was charged by the SEC in 2023 for fraud and violations of US securities laws related to the sale of TRX tokens.\n\nUndoubtedly, investor perception of Tron has been heavily influenced by the negative press generated by Justin Sun over the years. However, despite its early wobbles, Tron has gained traction in key markets outside the US and the EU.\n\nTwo key developments were responsible for this:\n\nThe addition of USDT to the Tron blockchain as a TRC20 token\n\nPartnership with Binance to support the Tron network on the popular exchange\n\nTron enjoyed the early mover advantage in providing an easily accessible electronic payment system based around a stablecoin, with very low fees and instant transactions. This proved highly attractive in regions that suffered from the following situations:\n\nLack of modern banking systems and high cross-border transaction fees (Asia, Africa)\n\nHigh levels of inflation that rendered the national currency unusable (Latin America)\n\nWestern sanctions blocking international bank payments (Russia, Iran)\n\nIn these regions and China, the users have acute real-world payment needs that Tron effectively meets. Most do not care about Justin Sun's reputation; many users may not even know his existence.\n\nUS regulators have repeatedly targeted USDT and Tron for non-compliance with financial regulations. However, they are both entrenched in the global market due to the early mover advantage\u2014rival options like USDC and Arbitrum arrived much later.\n\nHow Ethereum (and USDC) Compares\n\nRegarding reputation, Ethereum\u2019s equivalent to Justin Sun \u2013 co-founder Vitalik Buterin \u2013 has had no major scandals or controversies associated with him. He is generally recognized as an innovator and pioneer of blockchain technologies.\n\nEthereum also has a relatively clean reputation, which has aided its adoption as a platform for crypto innovation and investment in Western markets. In tandem, Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin has emerged as a popular alternative to USDT due to its focus on compliance with US financial regulations.\n\nThe critical thing to note is that while ETH is incredibly popular in the West, it is not widely used for real-world solutions like payments. Crypto is primarily seen as a tool for investment and wealth generation through holding or trading.\n\nIn contrast, Tron and USDT have gained popularity in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Russia as they offer viable alternatives where traditional banking and payment systems have failed.\n\nApplication Ecosystems\n\nA quick look at Dappradar.com reveals a clear mismatch between the two networks. Ethereum has well over 4,000 apps, with over a dozen showing thousands of unique active wallets (UAWs). Here is a quick look at the top 5 dapps on Ethereum:\n\nXterio: A gaming app with over 67k UAWs and transaction volumes of $716k in 24 hours\n\nUniswap V3: A popular trading and AMM protocol with 32k UAWs and $2.7b transactions\n\n1inch Network: A liquidity and DeFi aggregator with 9.4k UAWs and $225m transactions\n\nEigenLayer: A radical new restaking protocol with 8.8k UAWs and $392k transactions\n\nUniswap V2: The predecessor to V3, with 7.87k UAWs and $137m transactions\n\nFurther, Ethereum has over 236 core developers who made over 1.69k code commits in 30 days. According to DeveloperReport.com, the blockchain attracts the maximum number of active developers, with 2,392 as of December 2023.\n\nTron has more modest stats in comparison. Apart from 8 core developers, the blockchain reportedly has only 16 independent developers. The ecosystem is far from thriving, and developer activity seems dead mainly, although the platform has around 1380 apps and protocols.\n\nPayNet Staking: A high-risk staking app with 743 UAWs\n\nDegree Crypto Staking: Another decentralized staking app with over 500 UAWs\n\nTron NRG: A protocol that allows TRX stakers to rent their energy, with 171 UAWs\n\nBitget Swap: A trading wallet with 157 UAWs and $32.6k transactions in 24 hours\n\nJustLend DAO: A decentralized lending app with 119 UAWs and $277k transactions\n\nThese numbers show that Ethereum is way ahead of Tron in terms of ecosystem evolution and developer activity. The vast majority of Tron users are interested only in its USDT payments feature, which is not bad. It has a niche use case that has gained traction in specific parts of the globe.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is miles ahead when it comes to testing and developing new ways to use blockchain technology. If you are looking for innovative services and apps that could gain mainstream acceptance in the future, you are more likely to find those on Ethereum's ecosystem.\n\nScalability and Other Technical Aspects\n\nEthereum and Tron are highly scalable blockchains, unlike bitcoin, which relies on an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus model. While Ethereum uses a basic proof-of-stake model, Tron relies on a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nEthereum, in particular, has a significant lead when working on scaling solutions. Dutzende of L2 chains and side chains are currently under development. Tron presently has one primary L2 under development linked to Bitcoin.\n\nTransaction Speeds\n\nDue to the delegated PoS, Tron can process transactions much faster than Ethereum, resulting in a claimed average speed of around 2000 transactions per second (TPS). The Ethereum 2.0 mainnet can only handle between 15 and 30 TPS.\n\nThis could change with the addition of newer features like sharding to Ethereum via future updates. Besides, the blockchain already offers faster transaction speeds through sidechains and L2s like Arbitrum (4000 TPS), Polygon (65,000 TPS) and Base (2000 TPS).\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nEthereum is more friendly towards developers as it supports a wide array of programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Rust, Dart, Delphi, Go, Java, and Javascript. In contrast, Tron has adopted a narrower approach, supporting only Python and Solidity.\n\nFuture Prospects: Coexistence or Competition?\n\nGiven the highly chaotic and relatively unregulated nature of cryptocurrency markets, making confident predictions about anything is difficult. On the future of the ongoing competition between Ethereum and Tron, we can see at least three ways in which it can play out:\n\nScenario 1: Winner Take All\n\nEthereum's more likely outcome here is a win. It has wider investor acceptance, and its main weakness is slow and expensive transactions. These issues can realistically be solved via future updates and L2s.\n\nA Tron win is less likely for a multitude of reasons. Apart from the charges against Justin Sun, Tron is also under investigation for using its platform to evade sanctions in Russia and for dangerous activities like terrorism financing in the Middle East.\n\nScenario 2: Coexistence\n\nBoth Ethereum and Tron gravitate towards opposing extremes in the crypto world. Ethereum thrives in highly regulated and developed markets as it can attract and sustain more institutional investors. The SEC approved ETH futures in 2023. Spot ETFs could follow suit, probably after another legal battle in the US courts.\n\nMeanwhile, Tron seemingly thrives more in grey, unregulated financial markets and regions where financial inclusion faces significant challenges. As regulators in the West exert greater pressure on the blockchain industry, Tron and USDT could focus more on markets in Asia, Latin America, and Russia.\n\nScenario 3: Another Blockchain Wins\n\nIn this scenario, either an existing or brand-new L1 could rise and disrupt the entire ecosystem, vanquishing Ethereum and Tron. We already have one such contender, Solana (SOL).\n\nSolana already has faster and cheaper transactions and scalability. It is also the fifth most valuable crypto at the time of writing, with a market cap of $61 billion. It is arguably the top L1 contender that has a reasonable chance to overtake Ethereum in the next decade.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nBoth ETH and TRX present interesting opportunities for crypto investors.\n\nETH is the world\u2019s second most popular crypto with exciting long-term holding prospects, decent staking APY, and significant institutional backing.\n\nTRX offers the chance to earn high APY through staking and the advantages of near-zero transaction fees. However, it is significantly more vulnerable to regulatory action.\n\nThese two cryptos have different evolutionary trajectories, audiences, and potential use cases.\n\nMuch depends on your risk appetite and jurisdiction. For US/EU investors who care about compliance and transparency, ETH and USDC are likely safer alternatives to TRX and USDT. But a savvy investor could always buy both.\n\nJoin us at Bitcoin Market Journal and get the best analysis of the leading projects each week."

        "content": "Michael Saylor thinks they won\u2019t launch at all, and even some fund issuers think it\u2019s unlikely this year. Meanwhile, other countries are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nThe battle to launch exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum\u2019s spot price in the U.S. is heating up \u2014 and so far, the journey looks similar to Bitcoin\u2019s long and messy road to approval.\n\nOnce again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is dragging its heels on offering a definitive answer to the applications already made. A green light matters because it would allow investors to gain exposure to ETH without owning the underlying asset.\n\nGrayscale and Franklin Templeton were both due to receive a response from the SEC in April, but the regulator\u2019s now pushed their deadlines back to June.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock have had similar applications kicked into the long grass as well. VanEck and ARK Invest are due to receive a response later this month, but hopes of approval have been dwindling fast.\n\nWhy? Because there are signs that the regulator believes that Ether is a security, and not a commodity like Bitcoin.\n\nYou might also like: What\u2019s next for global finance?\n\nA growing dispute\n\nBack in June 2023, speaking in front of the House Financial Services Committee, SEC chair Gary Gensler had refused to say whether he believes ETH is a security.\n\nThe lack of a clear answer had spooked the crypto industry \u2014 especially considering this contradicted earlier guidance made by his predecessor Jay Clayton.\n\nAnd even earlier than that, around the time of The Merge in September 2022, Gensler had hinted that the staking process may fall under securities rules.\n\nEther\u2019s status matters because it determines which organization holds regulatory oversight in the U.S. \u2014 and if it is a security, this could cause big problems for other altcoins.\n\nConsensus recently sued the SEC and leapt to Ethereum\u2019s defense \u2014 arguing the commission\u2019s \u201cunlawful power grab threatens to undermine America\u2019s position as a leader of the next generation of the internet.\u201d\n\nThe Case for #Bitcoin on the Corporate Balance Sheet pic.twitter.com/LcZ4V2nqV0 \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) May 3, 2024\n\nSaylor\u2019s prediction\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s executive chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal Bitcoin supporter who spearheaded efforts to add hundreds of thousands of BTC to the company\u2019s balance sheet, doesn\u2019t believe that ETFs based on ETH\u2019s spot price will ever see the light of day. Speaking at the annual Bitcoin for Corporations event, he warned:\n\n\u201cSome time this summer, it\u2019ll be very clear to everyone that Ethereum is deemed a cryptoasset security, not a commodity. After that, you\u2019re gonna see that Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Ripple, Cardano \u2014 everything down the stack \u2014 is just a cryptoasset security unregistered. None of them will ever be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will be accepted by Wall Street, none of them will be accepted by mainstream institutional investors as cryptoassets. [Bitcoin] is the one universal, consensus accepted, institutional-grade cryptoasset in the world. There won\u2019t be another one.\u201d Michael Saylor\n\nOf course, you could argue that Saylor was bound to say this \u2014 especially considering that he believes BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is technically and ethically sound. Speaking at the Blockchain Economy Istanbul Summit back in July 2022, he had warned that Ether\u2019s continual upgrades \u201cintroduce new attack surfaces\u201d that undermine security and reliability.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe bigger challenge now appears to be that there\u2019s a lack of dialog between the SEC and firms hoping to bring an Ether ETF to market. As Barron\u2019s reported last month, applicants aren\u2019t being given \u201cthe critical feedback needed to finalize their products.\u201d By contrast, BTC ETF issuers had engaged in a \u201crobust back-and-forth\u201d before their funds started trading.\n\nJan van Eck, whose eponymous investment firm is awaiting a verdict from the SEC, candidly told CNBC in April that he believes the application will \u201cprobably be rejected\u201d \u2014 while Jean-Marie Mognetti from CoinShares predicted that no approvals will happen in 2024.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues to be paralyzed by regulatory uncertainty, where a lack of clarity on Ether\u2019s status is leaving crypto firms exasperated, other jurisdictions are gaining a first-mover advantage.\n\nAlthough trading volumes were rather tepid on the first day, it remains significant that Hong Kong has now launched an ETH ETF, amid speculation this could one day open the door to investors from mainland China.\n\nAs S&P Global recently noted, funds based on Ether\u2019s spot price have already been approved in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany \u2014 with some offering additional yield by offering staking returns as well.\n\nWith ETFs in other territories now boasting billions of dollars in assets under management, the U.S. risks falling further and further behind."

        "content": "Crypto markets flipped bullish after last week\u2019s carnage.\n\nFed Chair Powell said rate hike is \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nHigh inflation and unemployment worries have passed, says analyst.\n\nCrypto markets have recouped losses after last week\u2019s crash, which saw Bitcoin fall as low as $56,000.\n\nThe renewed bullishness comes amid slowing job growth \u2014 a possible sign of easing inflation \u2014 and hopes of rate cuts later this year.\n\nToday, the largest cryptocurrency is back trading at just above $65,000. The second-largest Ethereum is up 11% since its low last Wednesday.\n\nOverall, the wider cryptocurrency market added some $200 billion, according to CoinGecko, since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke on May 1.\n\nHe signalled that a rate hike \u2014 when the central bank raises interest rates and increases borrowing costs for banks and businesses \u2014 would be \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cthe coast is far from clear\u201d for the Federal Reserve to begin lowering interest rates soon, according to Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto is Macro Now\u201d newsletter.\n\nInterest rates in the United States have risen to record highs as the Federal Reserve combats rampant inflation stoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. High interest rates also increase the amount people earn on their bank holdings, another incentive to keep cash rather than spend it.\n\nRate hikes are thus less beneficial for stocks and riskier investments like cryptocurrencies, as seen in last week\u2019s dramatic drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn the first quarter, economic growth in the US slowed to its lowest level in nearly two years. The deceleration was partly attributed to a moderation in consumer spending and a widening trade deficit, or when a country imports more goods than it exports.\n\nWhen rates are higher, business loans become more expensive, which discourages owners from expanding or hiring. The ripple effects can slow the wider economy as well.\n\nRecent employment data released Friday, for instance, revealed the slowest job growth in six months and lower than the average monthly gain over the last year.\n\nStagflation concerns \u2018behind us\u2019\n\nHigh unemployment combined with inflation and slowed economic activity would spell even more trouble for Powell.\n\nPowell\u2019s key objective these days is to avoid stagflation, an economic climate in which the economy continues to face high inflation while in a recession.\n\nAccording to crypto venture capital firm Ryze Labs, that situation looks less likely to occur.\n\n\u201cWith rate hikes off the table and markets already pricing in little to no cuts for 2024, we think this bodes constructively for risk assets,\u201d Ryze Labs analysts told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe worst of stagflationary headwinds might be behind us,\u201d they said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin rose by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,200.\n\nEthereum jumped 1.9% to $3,200.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

This transition has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption, with reports indicating a 99.95% decrease.\n\nA few weeks ago, the network implemented the Dencun upgrade, which was designed to improve its functionality and performance. However, following this upgrade, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline, falling below the $3,000 mark.\n\nETH had recently shown growth, rising by 1.9% in the last 24 hours. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,200, according to CoinGecko data. ETH is up by 64.8% year-to-date and has regained the $3,000 level recently.\n\nAlso read: How High Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Surge This Week?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction for the week\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for the week. According to their analysis, ETH is expected to reach a minimum price of $3,141 and a maximum price of $3,241. The average price is expected to be $3,200.\n\nThe prediction reveals that ETH is unlikely to hit the $4,000 level this week. The recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has been largely attributed to the pump after recent market volatility. With Bitcoin once again back above $65,000, ETH has renewed its rally.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Forecasted To Reach 3 Cents: Here\u2019s When\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space. Its robust ecosystem, which hosts a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continues to drive innovation and adoption.\n\nHowever, Ethereum also faces challenges, such as high gas fees and scalability issues, which have led to the rise of competing blockchain networks."

        "title": "Why Ethereum Game \u2018Fantasy Top\u2019 Is Taking Over Crypto Twitter - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhat\u2019s Crypto Twitter buzzing about now? A game built around Crypto Twitter, believe it or not\u2014one offering sizable rewards and incentives for players.\n\nFantasy Top is captivating the crypto faithful by transforming the industry\u2019s biggest and buzziest social media personalities into Ethereum NFT trading cards on scaling network Blast. Players can crush rivals by creating card lineups that have the best real-world Twitter engagement during each competition, and earn crypto and in-game prizes in return.\n\nCrypto\u2019s biggest tweeters have excitedly embraced it, promoting their own in-game cards or sharing their lineups, as well as bragging about how much their NFTs have surged in value in a short period of time. They\u2019re even forming private groups of holders to discuss strategies and incentivize buyers.\n\nLaunched on Blast mainnet on May 1 by pseudonymous creator Travis Bickle, Fantasy Top is effectively Sorare if it were built around outspoken crypto personalities and traders rather than professional soccer players. The influencers in question earn a small cut of each trade of their own cards, along with other perks\u2014but many appear to have invested significantly into building their own lineups, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is an attention economy And @fantasy_top_ is gamifying it pic.twitter.com/nkN9QYYvY8 \u2014 Tenacious (@TenaciousBit) May 6, 2024\n\nThe list of in-game NFT \u201cheroes\u201d includes meme coin trader of the moment Ansem, 9dcc founder Gmoney, Blast founder Pacman, famed weird tweeter Greg16676935420, DeGods creator Frank, whale NFT traders Pranksy and Machi Big Brother, and even Su Zhu\u2014the co-founder of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nMachi just deposited 700 ETH into his @fantasy_top_ wallet Expecting some big sales today pic.twitter.com/lxWtxOcfU2 \u2014 Clemente (@Chilearmy123) May 6, 2024\n\nFarokh Sarmad of Rug Radio, which is merging with Decrypt, is another one of the featured personalities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s about more than just buying the NFTs of crypto traders you like and putting them in a lineup for each competition, however. There are multiple rarity levels to cards, including the ability to trade up multiple lower-level cards to unlock a higher level, which provides a points boost in each competition.\n\nThere\u2019s another curious wrinkle to consider: Scoring is based on your lineup\u2019s actual social media engagement, which raises the question of what counts as quality engagement\u2014and how that could potentially be manipulated.\n\nSome of the most expensive cards in Fantasy Top. Image: Decrypt\n\nOne \u201chero\u201d in question, content creator Jenn Duong, temporarily put her Twitter account private on Sunday after noticing that one of her Twitter videos had abnormally large engagement numbers. She suggested that users were \u201cbotting\u201d her content, or artificially inflating the engagement, which she feared would cause potential issues with her own play.\n\n\u201cPeople don't want to play fair and I'm not going to risk messing up my X algo,\u201d she tweeted, adding: \u201cPlease do not bot my shit. I don't need it. I'm betting on me, and I want to win on my own merit.\n\n\u201cYou're fucking up the systems for other creators,\u201d she added.\n\nPlease do not bot my shit. I don't need it. I'm betting on me, and I want to win on my own merit. You're fucking up the systems for other creators. \u2014 Jenn (@jenndefer) May 5, 2024\n\nBut the Fantasy Top hype continues unabated, and arguably hit a fever peak early Monday with the announcement of the prize pool for the first \u201cMain Competition\u201d that just began: over $150,000 worth of Ethereum (50 ETH), plus 222,222 Blast Gold that will lead to an airdrop allocation for the network\u2014along with card packs and other in-game rewards.\n\nWhile 50 ETH is no small change for a crypto game that launched last week, the far bigger prize could come from the Blast Gold. Crypto industry observers estimate the value of each Blast Gold above $10, putting that part of the prize pool potentially well above $2 million in total.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\ntrading volume is on the rise for @fantasy_top_ as we approach main tournament #1 current volume is > 50% of Ethereum mainnet's total NFT volume src: https://t.co/q91HcFqt6A pic.twitter.com/1N8tlxnOFm \u2014 hildobby (@hildobby_) May 6, 2024\n\nPlayers scrambled to buy up cards on the Fantasy Top marketplace, generating millions of dollars\u2019 worth of trading on scaling network Blast in the process\u2014equaling more than 50% of the total trading volume on Ethereum mainnet early Monday.\n\nA Flipside Crypto dashboard from analyst Hildobby shows over 7,000 ETH worth of NFT trading volume (over $21 million worth at the current price) and over 31,000 total users this week.\n\nFantasy Top has been a shot in the arm for Crypto Twitter denizens, resuscitating the positive vibes that have been missing in recent weeks amid a market lull. But we\u2019ll see whether a fantasy sports riff featuring Twitter influencers has the depth and intrigue to maintain momentum after the initial novelty and Blast network incentives fade.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Saw a Huge Surge as Furrever Token Hits $1 Million Presale Milestone, Launches $10,000 Competition - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nDespite recent turbulence in the crypto markets, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a remarkable surge in prices over the past two days. This unexpected rally comes amidst a backdrop of uncertainty, indicating renewed investor confidence in these leading cryptocurrencies. Adding to the fervor, Furrever Token (FURR) has achieved a significant milestone, surpassing $1 million in presale funding, and has now launched a lucrative $10,000 competition, further igniting excitement in the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin's Resilience Shines as Whales Drive Market Surge: What's Next for Crypto?\n\nAmidst recent market turbulence, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged resilient, witnessing a remarkable surge driven by whale activity. On May 3, the total market value soared to $2.18 trillion, propelled by a 10% increase in Bitcoin's price to approximately $64,300.75. Notably, over $2.8 billion worth of BTC was accumulated by whales within 24 hours, signaling renewed confidence in the market. Analysts interpret indicators such as the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) and Bollinger Bands, foreseeing a potential short-term turnaround.\n\nDespite recent corrections, market intelligence suggests key support levels and hints at a rebound, fostering optimism among investors. As Bitcoin trades at $61,721, attention turns to sustaining momentum above $59.7K, with the community eagerly anticipating further market growth and potential milestones.\n\nEthereum's Regulatory Challenges and Price Dynamics: Insights for Investors\n\nAmidst its pivotal role in the crypto landscape, Ethereum (ETH) faces a complex interplay of regulatory hurdles and market dynamics, offering crucial insights for investors. Currently trading at $3,158.07 with a 6% increase since yesterday, Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $373 billion. However, the path to launching Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain, with regulatory approval prospects cast into doubt by analysts like Bloomberg's James Seyffart. Seyffart suggests that approval for spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024 is improbable, potentially delayed until 2025, citing cautious behavior from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum's price trajectory reflects this uncertainty, experiencing fluctuations within a ranging channel, with bullish signals indicating potential for testing new highs. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands provide further insights into Ethereum's market momentum and consolidation phase. As Ethereum navigates through regulatory challenges and market fluctuations, its future outlook remains a subject of intense interest, with regulatory decisions poised to significantly impact adoption and integration of Ethereum-based financial products.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): Pioneering Cuteness in Crypto with $1 Million Presale Success and $10,000 Frenzy Bonanza Competition\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) has rapidly ascended as a darling of the investor community, captivating enthusiasts with its innovative approach and endearing charm.

With 65% of tokens available during the presale and a prudent allocation for team tokens locked for a year to reassure investors of the project's long-term viability, Furrever Token has demonstrated a commitment to transparency and sustainability.\n\nTo celebrate its successful presale progression, Furrever Token (FURR) has announced an exhilarating competition: the Furrever Token $10,000 Frenzy Bonanza Competition!

        "content": "Mon 06 May 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nAmid groundbreaking announcements, technological advancements, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove it is both a territory of boundless innovation and a field of regulatory and economic battles. Here\u2019s a rundown of the most striking news from the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, etc.\n\nMicroStrategy perseveres despite everything!\n\nMicroStrategy continued to increase its Bitcoin holdings, reaching an impressive total of 214,400 BTC with a recent acquisition of 122 Bitcoins for $7.8 million. Despite a net loss of $53 million in the first quarter of 2024 and a 5.5% decline in revenue compared to the previous year, the company maintains its strategy of massive investment in crypto. These market movements occurred in a context of increased volatility, affecting the value of the company\u2019s digital assets.\n\nThis bold strategy, although risky given the volatility of the crypto market, is a bet on the long-term profitability of Bitcoin. However, this approach has led to significant financial losses and prevented MicroStrategy from joining the S&P 500, a blow to the company\u2019s attractiveness to investors. The future of this strategy remains uncertain, but it demonstrates a firm commitment to the potential of Bitcoin.\n\nLight sentence for Changpeng Zhao despite serious charges\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, has been sentenced to only four months in prison and a $50 million fine for charges of fraud and compliance failures. This sentence is markedly more lenient than the three years requested by prosecutors and is perceived, by some, as a sign of leniency that downplays the seriousness of the infractions and thus sets a worrying precedent for the industry.\n\nFurthermore, this case highlights the challenges regulators face in an ever-evolving sector and underscores the need for a balance between promoting innovation and protecting investors. Zhao\u2019s case also illustrates the tension between strict regulation and the potential to push key players toward more permissive jurisdictions.\n\nTreasury takes aim at crypto fraudsters in France\n\nIn France, the gap between actual crypto usage and tax reporting is alarming. According to European Central Bank figures, about 5 million French people are crypto users, but only 150,000 tax filings have been recorded. This discovery has prompted Treasury action to take drastic steps to combat tax fraud, partly inspired by the massive fraud already observed in other schemes like MaPrimeR\u00e9nov, where 400 million euros were misappropriated.\n\nTo combat this scourge, the Treasury decided to deploy artificial intelligence for more effective and targeted surveillance. A new anti-fraud legislative framework, including a crypto-specific component, is in preparation. Artificial intelligence will be used to analyze blockchains and detect suspicious activities in real time, modeling fraud patterns to better track and unravel the most complex money-laundering circuits. This technological approach promises constant vigilance and an increased capacity to respond to fraudulent schemes.\n\nBNP Paribas invests in Bitcoin\n\nMay 1, 2024, is marked by a contradictory event in the world of Bitcoin ETFs, with record outflows of $563.7 million in a single day. Despite this tumultuous context, BNP Paribas, the second-largest European bank, has made a significant move towards Bitcoin adoption by investing approximately $40,000 in BlackRock\u2019s IBIT ETF. While modest, this investment is symbolic of the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin by traditional European financial institutions.\n\nThis move by BNP Paribas could mark the beginning of broader institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Until now, this adoption had been mainly by American asset managers and regional banks. BNP\u2019s commitment could encourage other major banks and asset managers to invest in Bitcoin, thereby accelerating its acceptance by the general public and boosting inflows into ETFs and other regulated vehicles.\n\nRippleX revolutionizes XRP with a new feature\n\nRippleX has recently launched an innovative feature, the XLS-68d specification, which aims to simplify and democratize transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This new specification allows platforms to manage fees and account reserves for their users, significantly reducing the complexity and financial barriers associated with using XRP. Users will benefit from what\u2019s called \u201csponsored transactions,\u201d where they can include sponsor signatures in their transactions while maintaining full control of their accounts.\n\nThis advancement is seen as a major step toward the mass adoption of XRP, as it enables platforms to cover the costs of transactions for their users, making XRP accessible to a broader audience.\n\nSEC controversy: Accusations of lying about Ethereum\n\nGary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, is accused of misleading the U.S. Congress about classifying Ethereum as an unregistered security. These revelations, stemming from internal SEC documents exposed during a lawsuit with the company Consensys, show that the agency considered ETH a security for over a year. These actions contradict the public statements of Gensler, who has declined to clarify the SEC\u2019s position on Ethereum during a hearing, avoiding direct questions on the subject.\n\nPatrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has openly criticized Gensler for what he considers deception towards Congress. This situation sheds light on the challenges and contradictions in the SEC\u2019s regulation of cryptos. The outcome of these regulatory debates could have significant implications for the legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in the United States.\n\nPayPal expands its crypto offerings with MoonPay\n\nPayPal has significantly expanded its crypto offerings through a strategic partnership with MoonPay. This collaboration allows PayPal to offer more than 100 different digital assets to its users, thus simplifying the purchase of cryptocurrencies just like an ordinary online purchase. Similarly, this partnership enhances the compatibility of crypto transactions with traditional banking systems and reduces transaction failures, providing a smooth and secure user experience.\n\nTo conclude, this integration guarantees better protection of customer personal data, who no longer need to provide their information separately to MoonPay for transactions. With the addition of popular cryptos such as Solana, Tether, and Dogecoin, PayPal broadens the possibilities for its users in terms of investment and everyday usage of cryptos.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecast As DeFi TVL Jumps To $57B, ETH Poised For $4,000 This Week? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price forecast: ETH is nearing its highest level in a little over a week in tandem with a strong crypto rebound from last week\u2019s bottom. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, upholds the bullish outlook closing in on the $65,000 mark.\n\nLeading altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) and XRP are also in the green, rewarding patient investors. Nevertheless, market doldrums cannot be ignored, especially in light of the many internal and internal factors in play.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExternally, skyrocketing inflation is a hindrance to risk asset classes like crypto. Recently the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged amid persistent inflation in the US since January.\n\nThe outlook for the first rate cut in the year has shifted as the Fed battles to bring inflation to 2%. Experts project that the first-rate cut may come late in the year as opposed to June.\n\nThe current Ethereum price forecast shows the leading smart contracts token hovering at $3,122 on Monday, down a modest 0.5% in 24 hours. Ranking #2 in the market, Ether boasts $374 billion \u2014 a value backed by $10 billion of trading volume.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Does DeFi TVL Impact ETH Technical Outlook?\n\nAccording to data processed and graphically presented by DeFi Llama, the cumulative value of all the assets locked in smart contracts within the ecosystem is back on the move, rising to $57 billion. Although this figure is a pale shadow of the $109 billion record high, persistent increases reduce potential selling pressure.\n\nInvestors show confidence in the long-term value of a coin by staking their holdings to grow their wallets. Staking rewards are distributed daily on an annualized basis, allowing the community to participate in processing transactions and securing the network.\n\nA high total value locked (TVL) reduces the circulating supply and subsequently, the potential selling pressure. Sentiment also improves encouraging more people to buy ETH, thus propping the token for gains.\n\nCan Ethereum Rally To $4,000 In May\n\nInvestors are holding firmly to their positions as the crypto market rebounds in May. April broke several months of a bullish streak ignited in Q4 last year. With major cryptocurrencies waking up strongly this week, aiming for higher levels this week and a rally to $4,000 before the end of May.\n\nThe bullish bet on Ethereum price hinges on the falling wedge seen on the daily chart. Although a bullish pattern, it remains unconfirmed until the price breaks above the upper trendline.\n\nTraders activate their buy orders following this breakout and anticipate a move equal to the distance between the widest points of the wedge \u2014 roughly 25%.\n\nOn the sell side, traders cannot ignore the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46. A careful examination reveals the indicator stuck below the trend line resistance. Should this trend continue, selling pressure will be a ticking bomb.\n\nEthereum price also sits below two bull market indicators; the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50-day EMA. Bulls must reclaim these two key levels to validate their strong grip on the uptrend.\n\nOtherwise, there\u2019s a glaring possibility of another sweep at the $3,000 and $2,800 support areas to collect more liquidity.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Sun 05 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe Ethereum network saw a record influx of new users at the end of April, despite a bearish crypto market. This newfound momentum is rekindling hope, but the influence of \u201cwhales\u201d raises questions.\n\nThe Rush Towards Ethereum\n\nAccording to Santiment, a company specializing in blockchain analysis, April 28 and 29 saw the creation of 266,600 new Ethereum wallets, a record since October 2022. This surge contrasts with the general gloom of the crypto market.\n\nSeveral factors explain this renewed interest:\n\nThe anticipation of upcoming network updates, aimed at improving its performance and security.\n\nThe recent fall in prices, perceived as a buying opportunity by investors looking for bargains.\n\nHowever, behind this improvement hides a more nuanced reality. According to CoinMarketCap, 97% of Ethereum addresses hold less than $1000 in crypto, while a handful of \u201cwhales\u201d concentrate 41% of the circulating supply, according to Clank, a whale tracking platform.\n\nOn average, each whale owns close to 10 million ETH, equivalent to $3.7 million, giving them a considerable influence over the network.\n\nETH Stands Strong Amidst the Storm\n\nDespite concerns related to capital concentration, Ethereum has shown resilience. Its price has risen by 30% since the beginning of the year, while the general crypto market has fallen by 8.75% in one week. Currently, ETH is trading at $2971.73 with a total market capitalization of $352 billion.\n\nThis relative stability reflects investors\u2019 confidence. According to the data available, 74% of Ethereum holders bet on the long term and keep their positions despite the market volatility. This \u201cHODLing\u201d (Hold On for Dear Life) mentality illustrates their belief in the project\u2019s future potential.\n\nThe massive arrival of new users on the Ethereum network sparks optimism, fueled by the anticipation of upcoming improvements and investment opportunities due to the recent drop in prices. However, the concentration of holdings in the hands of a few \u201cwhales\u201d remains a matter of concern for the community. Time will tell if Ethereum can maintain this positive momentum and further democratize its ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Bitcoin price must break through either $70,000 or $50,000 to decide next stable directional bias on weekly time frame.\n\nEthereum price action offers bullish reversal play in the cards for 25% upside potential.\n\nRipple price could climb 8% to $0.60 as XRP bulls sustain higher lows.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains devoid of a directional bias on the higher time frames. In the lower time frames, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the one-day timeframe shows both bulls and bears have folded their hands. This has altcoins in a state of confusion or disarray.\n\nAlso Read: Addressing the crypto investor dilemma: To invest or not?\n\nCryptocurrency prices FAQs How do new token launches or listings affect cryptocurrency prices? Token launches like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB airdrop and Optimism OP influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset\u2019s network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. How do hacks affect cryptocurrency prices? A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. How do macroeconomic releases and events affect cryptocurrency prices? Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates influence risk assets like Bitcoin, mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher. How do major crypto upgrades like halvings, hard forks affect cryptocurrency prices? Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset\u2019s price climbs. This has been observed in Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nBitcoin price needs a stable directional bias\n\nBitcoin price remains range-bound between $60,660 and $70,000. It is trading horizontally and without directional bias. Based on the volume profiles, both bulls and bears are playing it safe, seeing as there are no spikes within the vicinity of the current price.\n\nHowever, with the RSI above the mean level of 50 and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in positive territory, the odds lean in favor of the upside. To confirm this directional bias, however, the bulls must haul BTC to close decisively above $70,000 on the weekly chart.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if bears take over the market amid falling momentum shown by the nose-diving RSI, Bitcoin price could drop below $60,660. In a dire case, the dump could send BTC to the $50,000 threshold, below which the bullish bias would be invalidated.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price consolidates as buyer momentum flatlines, but MicroStrategy tops BTC ownership list\n\nEthereum price has 25% upside potential up its sleeve\n\nEthereum price could make a 25% run north if the descending wedge pattern, a bullish reversal technical formation, is activated. For this to happen, either of two scenarios must take place. First, Bitcoin price must give a clear directional bias that bodes well for altcoins, or secondly, altcoins must suck liquidity from Bitcoin price to initiate an alt season.\n\nA 25% climb above the breakout point for Ethereum price will send ETH to $4,250. For this to happen, however, ETH bulls must clear the resistance order block due to the volume spikes near $3,500 where a lot of bearish activity is waiting to descend on ETH.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased selling pressure could send Ethereum price below the $2,900 support. In a dire case where ETH records a lower low below $2,800, the bullish thesis would be negated.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum could see a brief rally despite Michael Saylor's jab at ETH ETFs\n\nRipple price eyes $0.60\n\nRipple price recorded an intraday high of $0.5703 on Monday with the potential for more gains as XRP bulls continue to show strength. If bulls manage a stable move above the peak of the market range at $0.5715, it would clear the path for a continuation of the uptrend above the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of the larger market range at $0.5847. This could set the tone for Ripple price to test the $0.6000 psychological level, nearly 10% above current levels.\n\nThe RSI continues to record higher lowers, signifying growing bullish strength. A stable move and close above the 50 mean level would confirm the continuation of the uptrend.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if bears take over and profit-booking takes form, the Ripple price could extend its fall. A candlestick close below $0.4952 would encourage more sell orders. For the bullish thesis to be invalidated, however, the price must close below $0.4500 on the one-day time frame.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple lawsuit to see SEC response on Monday, XRP nears 4.5 million mark in liquidity pools"

But recent data indicates that one of them is becoming scarcer.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum on exchanges decline\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the Bitcoin and Ethereum Balance on Exchange metric indicated a decline in the availability of these assets on exchanges.\n\nInterestingly, Ethereum\u2019s balance on exchanges has experienced a more pronounced decrease compared to Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode spanning from March 2023 to the present, the ETH balance on exchanges has plummeted by nearly 6%.\n\nStarting at 16% in March 2023, it has declined to 10.66% as of the latest figures.\n\nConversely, the BTC balance on exchanges has seen a milder decline of almost 2%, dropping from 13% in March 2023 to approximately 11.85% at press time.\n\nThe dwindling balance of Ethereum on exchanges suggested increasing scarcity of the assets available for trading.\n\nTypically, a decline in balance on exchanges implies that holders are withdrawing their assets from trading platforms.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, it could also indicate that holders are withdrawing and staking their assets for potential returns, further reducing the available supply for trading.\n\nHas it affected the number of holders?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s holders on Santiment revealed a consistent growth trend.\n\nAt the time of this assessment, the number of BTC holders had reached almost 54 million, while Ethereum boasted over 121 million holders.\n\nThis data suggests that both assets have steadily accrued holders over the past few months, indicating sustained interest and adoption.\n\nThe increase in the number of holders also aligns with the declining balance of these assets on exchanges, as observed in previous analyses.\n\nThis trend suggests that holders are actively withdrawing their assets from exchanges, possibly for long-term holding or other investment strategies.\n\nSuch behavior is generally interpreted as a positive sign for the assets, as it reflects confidence in their long-term value and utility.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum in profit rises\n\nAnalysis of the Bitcoin and Ethereum supply in profit indicated a recent uptrend. As of this writing, the ETH supply in profit was almost 117 million, while BTC registered nearly 18 million.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThis upward movement aligned with the recent price rebound observed in both BTC and ETH markets.\n\nAs of this writing, ETH was trading at approximately $3,200 with a gain of over 2%, while Bitcoin was priced at around $65,200, also experiencing an increase of almost 2%."

        "content": "Following the emergence of one prominent contributor, Ethereum broke its monthly stablecoin volume record in April. Indeed, the network volume last month was a significant increase over any month for the blockchain previously.\n\nIn April, Ethereum saw its monthly stablecoin volume reach a remarkable $1.12 trillion. Moreover, the majority of that landmark figure was contributed by DAI, whose participation in MEV transactions has accounted for a big part of the volume surge that Ethereum has enjoyed.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Wallet Wakes Up After 8 Years With $5.9 Million\n\nEthereum\u2019s $1.2 Billion Stablecoin Volume in April is a New Record\n\nThe digital asset market has seen a lot of potential in the ever-growing stablecoin market. Indeed, these cryptocurrencies are backed by real assets, typically fiat currencies like the US dollar. Moreover, their prevalence in the industry has been undeniable.\n\nYet, they seem to only be growing in prevalence, as Ethereum broke its monthly stablecoin volume record in April. According to data from The Block, this record-shattering month is connected to the presence of flash loan activity, which catapulted the figure.\n\nSource: Watcher.Guru\n\nAlso Read: Ripple Surges After Stablecoin Announcement: Can XRP Hit $1?\n\nData shows that DAI\u2019s involvement has been a huge catalyst in bringing about a surge in volume for Ethereum. The data shows that a single transaction added nearly a billion dollars in volume on its own.\n\nDAI had been responsible for $636 billion in volume for the month of April. This was undoubtedly the primary stablecoin for Ethereum\u2019s total on-chain volume, whose total reached $1.2 trillion for the first time.\n\nMoreover, those figures are expected to continue to be impressive heading into the month of May. Not only was DAI impressive, but upcoming stablecoins are set to be important in the growth trajectory of the market."

        "content": "Metrics suggested that Ethereum was undervalued.\n\nMarket indicators gave ambiguous signals regarding an upcoming bull rally.\n\nEthereum [ETH] came back on track on the 6th of May as its price once again crossed $3.1k. While the token crossed the psychological resistance, it also consolidated inside a bull pattern.\n\nA breakout above the pattern could allow ETH to reach new highs in the coming weeks.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nLast week was not in investors\u2019 best interest as the king of altcoins\u2019 price plummeted to $2.8k. However, the token gained bullish momentum on the 1st of May as its price moved up steadily.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price increased by over 1.55% in the last 24 hours. At press time, it was trading at $3,144.11 with a market capitalization of over $377 billion.\n\nIn the meantime, World of Charts, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting a falling edge pattern on ETH\u2019s chart.\n\nThe token started to consolidate inside the pattern since the beginning of March. As per the tweet, the correction phase for ETH was over as it was headed towards the upper trendline of the falling wedge.\n\nA successful breakout from the falling wedge pattern could lead to a 45%-50% price rise in the coming weeks. Predicting Ethereum\u2019s price, it might as well surpass its March high if a bull rally happens.\n\nIs Ethereum ready for a rally?\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics to see whether they supported the possibility of a breakout.\n\nNotably, ETH\u2019s Network To Value (NVT) ratio registered a downtick after a sharp increase. A drop in the metric means that an asset is undervalued.\n\nOur analysis of Santiment\u2019s data pointed out a few other bullish metrics. For instance, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio improved over the last week. Its Network Growth was also high.\n\nThis meant that more new addresses were created to transfer the token, reflecting high activity.\n\nHowever, Lookonchain\u2019s latest tweet pointed towards a sell-off. As per the tweet, a whale sold 7k ETH, which, at press time, was worth over $22 million, according to AMBCrypto Converter.\n\nThis seemed bearish, as it hinted that the whale was expecting a price drop.\n\nTo better understand whether a breakout above the falling wedge pattern was possible, AMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAs per our analysis, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and had a value of 49.7, suggesting that the chances of an upward price movement were high.\n\nNonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) supported the bears as it was resting below the neutral mark of 50."

        "content": "Top altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB registered major gains over the last 24 hours\n\nHowever, metrics and technical indicators weren\u2019t all bullish\n\nBitcoin\u2019s last 24 hours have been productive, with the cryptocurrency climbing back above $63,000 on the charts. As expected, most of the market\u2019s altcoins followed suit, with their charts seeing green as well. However, the latter\u2019s performances fueled a fall in Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] dominance. In fact, it hit such a critical level that a fresh altcoin season could be right around the corner now.\n\nAltcoin season is here\n\nCaptain Faibik, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet highlighting an interesting development. As per the same, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is now moving inside a rising wedge pattern. What this means is that the chances of BTC dominance falling over the coming days are quite likely. This would be a positive sign for altcoins as their market cap is likely to surge then.\n\nMags, another famous crypto-analyst, also shared a tweet mentioning a historical event. The tweet stated that in 2020, the altcoin market was in an accumulation phase. That ended in the second half of the year, kick-starting a massive bull rally.\n\nThe analyst believes a similar trend can be seen this time around, further increasing the chances of an altcoin season soon. If the rally happens, then altcoins\u2019 market capitalization can be expected to hike dramatically.\n\nA look at the top altcoins\n\nTo see whether altcoins are preparing for a rally, what better way than to check the performance of the top alts? According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum [ETH], the king of altcoins, pushed its price up by more than 4.5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $3,111.72 with a market cap of over $373 billion.\n\nLike ETH, BNB and Solana [SOL] also turned bullish as their values surged by 3.6% and 5%, respectively. At press time, BNB was trading at $586, while SOL\u2019s value rested at $145.2.\n\nHowever, it was surprising to note that despite the recent price upticks, investors\u2019 confidence in these top altcoins remained low. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH, SOL, and BNB\u2019s weighted sentiments all remained in the negative zone.\n\nHowever, the good news was that Ethereum\u2019s open interest rose slightly along with its price. A rise in this metric is usually a sign that the prevailing price trend is likely to continue.\n\nSOL\u2019s open interest took ETH\u2019s lead as it registered an uptick as well. On the contrary, the same for BNB fell, despite its price recording an uptick on the charts.\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart to see whether it could sustain its bull run. We found that its Money Flow Index (MFI) went sideways after an uptick, while its Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved south.\n\nThese suggested that investors might not see ETH\u2019s price rise explosively in the short term.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nSimilarly, Solana\u2019s technical indicators looked pretty bearish too. Both its MFI and CMF went south, indicating that the token\u2019s rally might not last.\n\nConsidering these data sets, it will be interesting to see how soon a fresh altcoin season comes along."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt's been a quiet Monday morning so far near the top of the cryptocurrency charts, as most of the biggest coins by market cap are trading either sideways or slightly down. Solana is the notable exception, rising nearly 5% over the past day.\n\nSolana is currently trading at $154, pushing its weeklong gain to over 12% per data from CoinGecko. Like many cryptocurrencies, Solana has had a rough month, swinging from a high of $184 to a low of nearly $120 during that span. But it's been ticking back up over the last week as gains outpace those of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThat's true over the last 24 hours as well, with Bitcoin sitting at a price of $63,650, down over 1%, while Ethereum is down over 2% to $3,092 as of this writing. Over the past week, Bitcoin is up by 1.3% while Ethereum remains down by 2.6%.\n\nExpanding out to the top 100 coins by market cap, a couple of the biggest gainers are also deployed on Solana. JUP, the token of decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter, is up 6% today to a current price of $1.14, while meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) is up nearly 5% to $3.43.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana's recent revival also comes as the network sees a surge in new tokens deployed via the network's SPL standard. On Saturday, 14,648 new tokens were deployed on Solana via data from Solscan, setting a new all-time record, and every day over the last two weeks has yielded at least 10,000 new tokens on the network."

        "content": "ETH\u2019s price appreciated by over 5% on 3 May\n\nThis contributed to a hike in the number of short positions liquidated\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] 7% price rally during the intraday trading session on 3 May caused short liquidations on its derivatives market to rally to a two-month high, according to Coinglass.\n\nIn fact, the on-chain data provider went on to reveal that on that day, $35 million worth of ETH\u2019s short positions were liquidated. In comparison, long liquidations totalled just $7.16 million.\n\nLiquidations happen in an asset\u2019s derivatives market when a trader\u2019s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. Short liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly rises, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price decline are forced to exit their positions.\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the altcoin closed on 3 May above $3000 after trading below that price level since the beginning of the month.\n\nDerivatives market traders stay their hands\n\nStill extending its gains at press time, ETH\u2019s price was up by over 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the market-leading altcoin was valued at $3,104.\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that Coinglass data also suggested that the price rally has not instigated any significant activity in ETH\u2019s derivatives market. In fact, trading volume in that market grew by just 2%.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nSimilarly, the coin\u2019s Futures open interest recorded a minor 3% hike over the same period. ETH\u2019s Futures open interest was $10.68 billion at press time. Furthermore, ETH\u2019s Options volume cratered by over 50% during the period under review.\n\nOptions trading grants participants the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified date. Generally, when ETH sees a decline in its Options volume, it means that there is less speculation on its future price movements as market participants wait to see where the coin\u2019s market might be heading next.\n\nA combined reading of the minor hike in ETH\u2019s Futures trading volume and its declining Options volume suggests that the coin\u2019s derivatives market participants have adopted a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. Simply put, they are not placing significant bets on where its price might head next."
