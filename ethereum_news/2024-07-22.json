        "title": "The Investment Case for Ethereum in 2024 - VanEck",
        "content": "Please note that VanEck has exposure to Ethereum.\n\nSince its release in 2015, Ethereum adoption has grown exponentially, attracting hundreds of millions of users, and gaining the attention of mainstream investment firms and payment applications. As a decentralized platform enabling smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party, Ethereum stands out in the cryptocurrency world. This article evaluates Ethereum\u2019s potential as an investment, considering its unique position and future prospects in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: More Than Just a Cryptocurrency\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology but extends beyond being just a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is central to its operations, differentiating it from other digital currencies. The EVM, a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node, executed bytecode and smart contracts \u2013 self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, operating without downtime, censorship, or fraud. This innovation shifts the paradigm from traditional contracts requiring intermediaries to automated, trustless transactions.\n\nMarket Dynamics: Assessing Ethereum's Investment Viability\n\nPrice Influences: Market Sentiment and Global Trends\n\nThe price of Ethereum is influenced by market sentiment, driven by news, social media, and overall attitude towards the crypto market, which significantly impacts Ethereum\u2019s price. Positive news about institutional adoption can lead to price surges, while negative sentiment, such as fears of regulatory crackdowns, can cause price drops.\n\nMarket Sentiment: Investor sentiment plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market, often driven by news, social media, and overall investor attitude towards the crypto space. For example, positive news about institutional adoption of Ethereum can lead to price surges, as seen when large financial institutions announce their support for Ethereum or when there's a growing interest in decentralized finance platforms built on Ethereum. Conversely, negative sentiment, such as the spreading of unfounded rumors or fears of a regulatory crackdown, can lead to significant price drops.\n\nGlobal Economic Trends: Macroeconomic factors such as inflation rates, interest rates, and economic policies in major economies can significantly impact Ethereum's price. For instance, during times of high inflation, some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum as a hedge against their local currency's devaluation. Similarly, changes in monetary policy, such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like Ethereum.\n\nRegulatory Changes: The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is continually evolving and can have immediate impacts on their prices. Positive regulatory news, such as a country legalizing cryptocurrencies or clarifying tax guidance, can lead to price increases. Conversely, negative regulatory actions, such as bans or restrictive regulations in significant markets like the US, China, or South Korea, can lead to sharp declines in price. For example, China's crackdown on cryptocurrency mining and trading in 2021 led to a significant drop in the price of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTechnological Developments: Advances in Ethereum\u2019s technology or its ecosystem can also influence its price. The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), aimed to reduce transaction fees and increase transaction speed and energy efficiency. Such upgrades can lead to positive price movements as they address scalability and cost issues. However, delays or problems in these technological upgrades can lead to negative market reactions.\n\nHistorical Price Analysis: From Launch to 2024\n\nEthereum has experienced significant volatility since its launch, reflecting market dynamics, technological milestones, and investor sentiment.\n\n2017 Boom: Ethereum\u2019s first major price increase occurred in 2017, peaking at around $1,400 in early 2018, alongside a broader cryptocurrency market boom.\n\n2020-2021 Growth: Significant growth in 2020 and 2021 saw Ethereum reaching new highs above $4,000, driven by its growing adoption and the booming DeFi sector.\n\nCrypto ETFs: The adoption of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has further boosted Ethereum\u2019s price. ETFs provide a regulated way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, attracting both individual and institutional investors and increasing demand for Ethereum."

        "content": "ATLANTA, July 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ), a leading global provider of exchange-traded products (ETPs), in partnership with Galaxy Asset Management,1, one of the world's largest digital assets and blockchain investment managers, today announced the launch of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH). QETH is a spot ETP that invests directly in physical Ethereum to offer investors access to the performance of the market price of Ethereum, as measured by the Lukka Prime Ethereum Reference Rate2. QETH begins trading on the Cboe BZX Exchange today, granting investors access to Ethereum investing.\n\nQETH offers investors a differentiated and accessible way of participating in the disruptive ether market. It will leverage Invesco's track record of pioneering innovative ETPs and Galaxy's deep institutional-grade infrastructure and significant expertise in digital asset management.\n\nThe launch of QETH builds on Galaxy's and Invesco's successful joint track record following the launch of the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) in January of this year.\n\n\"Today's launch of Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF will leverage Invesco's experience in managing ETPs and Galaxy's expertise with digital assets to provide investors with efficient and secure exposure to Ethereum,\" says Brian Hartigan, Global Head of ETF and Index Strategy at Invesco. \"QETH joins Invesco Galaxy ETP's BTCO, SATO and BLKC in providing easier access and additional safeguards to US investors looking to create a varied digital assets portfolio with ETFs.\"\n\n\"ETH has served as a core asset in crypto portfolios for a long time, driven by the tremendous success of the Ethereum blockchain,\" said Steve Kurz, Global Head of Galaxy Asset Management. \"With the launch of QETH, we are excited to offer investors exposure to this burgeoning asset class in a format that is familiar, safe, and easy to trade. By combining our unrivalled collective experience in developing best-in-class investment solutions across both traditional and digital asset markets, Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management are well-positioned to continue at the forefront of enabling institutional exposure to the most value-creative corners of the digital asset ecosystem.\"\n\nTo view the full prospectus for the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, please visit this link: https://connect.rightprospectus.com/Invesco/TVT/46148D107/P?site=ETF\n\n1 Galaxy Asset Management is not affiliated with Invesco. Galaxy Asset Management is the Galaxy Division that operates Galaxy Digital Funds, the execution agent of QETH.\n\n2 The Lukka Prime Ethereum Reference Rate represents a fair market value for Ethereum that is aligned to GAAP and IFRS guidelines.\n\nAbout Invesco Ltd.\n\nInvesco Ltd.

Additional information about Galaxy's businesses and products is available on www.galaxy.com.\n\nThe Fund is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. An investor may lose all or substantially all of an investment in the Fund. The Fund is not a mutual fund or any other type of Investment Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder.\n\nShares in the Fund are not FDIC insured, may lose value and have no bank guarantee.\n\nThis material must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.\n\nThe Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind.\n\nThe Trust will not participate in the proof-of-stake validation mechanism of the Ethereum network (i.e., the Trust will not \"stake\" its ether) to earn additional ether or seek other means of generating income from its ether holdings.\n\nEther has historically exhibited high price volatility relative to more traditional asset classes, which may be due to speculation regarding potential future appreciation in value.\n\nThe value of the Trust's investments in Ethereum could decline rapidly, including to zero.\n\nThe further development and acceptance of the Ethereum network, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the network may adversely affect the price of ether and therefore an investment in the Shares.\n\nCurrently, there is relatively limited use of ether in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively extensive use as a store of value, contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\n\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in bitcoin or restrict the use of ether or the operations of the Ethereum network or venues on which bitcoin trades. For example, it may become difficult or illegal to acquire, hold, sell or use ether in one or more countries, which could adversely impact the price of ether.\n\nIn the past, flaws in the source code for ether have been discovered, including those that resulted in the theft of users' ether. Several errors and defects have been publicly found and corrected, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users' personal information. Discovery of flaws in or exploitations of the source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money in contravention of known network rules has occurred.\n\nThe Trust's returns will not match the performance of ether because the Trust incurs the Sponsor Fee and may incur other expenses.\n\nThe Market Price of shares may reflect a discount or premium to NAV.\n\nThe price of ether may be impacted by the behaviour of a small number of influential individuals or companies.\n\nThe Ethereum network and ether face scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective.\n\nCompetition from central bank digital currencies (\"CDBCs\") and other digital assets could adversely affect the value of ether and other digital assets.\n\nPrices of ether may be affected due to stablecoins, the activities of stablecoin users and their regulatory treatment.\n\nA temporary or permanent \"fork\" in the Ethereum network could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. A disruption of the internet may affect the use of Ethereum and subsequently the value of the Shares.\n\nRisks of over or under regulation in the digital asset ecosystem could stifle innovation, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares.\n\nFuture regulations may require the Trust and the Sponsor to become registered, which may cause the Trust to liquidate.\n\nThe tax treatment of ether and other digital assets is uncertain and may be adverse, which could adversely affect the value of an investment in the Shares.\n\nThe venues through which ether trades are relatively new and may be more exposed to operations problems or failure than trading venues for other assets.\n\nThe Trust is subject to the risks due to its concentration in a single asset.\n\nEther spot trading venues are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional equity exchanges.\n\nEthereum transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Trust.\n\nThe opinions expressed herein are based on current market conditions and are subject to change without notice. These opinions may differ from those of other Invesco or Galaxy investment professionals.\n\nThis does not constitute a recommendation of any investment strategy or product for a particular investor. Investors should consult a financial professional before making any investment decisions.\n\nShares are not individually redeemable and owners of the Shares may acquire those Shares from the Fund and tender those Shares for redemption to the Fund in Creation Unit aggregations only, typically consisting of 10,000, 20,000, 25,000, 50,000, 80,000, 100,000 or 150,000 Shares.\n\nInvesco Distributors, Inc. is the US distributor for Invesco's retail products and private placements, and Invesco Capital Management LLC is the investment adviser for ETFs. Both entities are indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of Invesco Ltd.\n\nNA 3687270 7/24\n\nMedia Relations Contact: Stephanie Diiorio, 212-278-9037, [email protected]\n\nSOURCE Invesco Ltd."

        "content": "STAMFORD, Conn., July 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments\u00ae, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset manager*, offering more than 20 crypto investment products, today announced that Grayscale Ethereum Trust (Ticker: ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (Ticker: ETH) have begun trading on NYSE Arca as of 4:00 AM ET today as spot Ethereum ETPs following the recent regulatory approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The launch and commencement of trading for ETH and ETHE represents a groundbreaking achievement for Grayscale\u2019s clients and the broader Ethereum community.\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (\u201cETH\u201d) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (\u201cETHE\u201d) are not funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, unlike most mutual funds or ETFs. Investing involves significant risk, including possible loss of principal. The Trusts may not be suitable for all investors.\n\nETHE has become the largest spot Ethereum ETP with $9.19B AUM as of July 23, 2024, and has come to market with an established and diverse investor base across retail and institutional investors alike.\n\nETH launched today as a lower fee** spot Ethereum ETP through the innovative mechanics of initial seeding by distributing 10% of ETHE's underlying Ethereum. As such, ETH has commenced trading as the second largest spot Ethereum ETP*, with a uniquely diversified investor base, and $1.02B AUM as of July 22, 2024. ETHE\u2019s distribution event is colloquially known as a \u201cspin-off,\u201d and is a corporate action that is not expected to be a taxable event for ETHE nor any beneficial owner of ETHE shares as of the previously announced Record Date of July 18, 2024. Investors are encouraged to consult a tax advisor for related tax guidance.\n\n\"The Grayscale team could not be more excited for ETH and ETHE to begin trading today as spot Ethereum ETPs on NYSE Arca,\u201d said Grayscale Senior Managing Director, Global Head of ETFs David LaValle. \u201cSpot Ethereum ETPs will provide U.S. investors, financial professionals, and asset allocators reliable and convenient access to Ethereum for the first time in the familiar, time-tested ETP wrapper. This is a huge milestone for investors and the ETF market, and demonstrates Grayscale\u2019s ongoing commitment to advancing digital asset investing in the United States.\u201d\n\nGrayscale remains committed to addressing increasing investor and market demand for Ether by expanding its range of Ethereum-focused investment products \u2013 aiming to build a product suite that can cater to investors' unique needs at every stage of their Ether investing journey. Grayscale has been and remains unwaveringly focused on working constructively with its investors, partners, regulators, and policymakers to help deepen the understanding of Ethereum and the Ethereum fee protocol to expand familiar access to the second largest crypto asset by market cap***.\n\n\u201cETH and ETHE will allow investors to invest in Ethereum's potential to create markets, transform financial systems, utilize Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and drive innovation through the trusted ETP wrapper -- without the need to buy, store, or manage Ethereum directly,\u201d said Grayscale Managing Director and Head of Distribution and Strategic Partnerships John Hoffman. \u201cClient demand is growing alongside the maturation of the crypto asset class, and Grayscale is proud to offer pioneering financial products that provide our clients\u2019 choice when considering convenient, registered exposure to crypto assets, like Ethereum.\"\n\nFor additional information about ETH, please visit: https://etfs.grayscale.com/eth For additional information about ETHE, please visit: https://etfs.grayscale.com/ethe.\n\n*By AUM as of July 22, 2024\n\n**Low cost based on gross expense ratio at 0% for the first six months of trading for the first $2.0 billion. After the fund reaches $2.0 billion in assets or after a 6-month waiver period, the fee will be 0.15%. Brokerage fees and other expenses may still apply. See prospectus for additional fee waiver information.\n\n*** By Market Cap as of July 22, 2024\n\nNO OFFER OR SOLICITATION\n\nThis communication is for informational purposes, solely in your capacity as a shareholder of ETHE, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

An investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust should be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of total loss associated with an investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Ethereum, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the shares could lose all or substantially all of their value. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust depends on the acceptance of the digital assets, the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and the fundamental investment characteristics of the digital asset. Digital asset networks are developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that certain high-profile contributors will no longer contribute to the network could have an adverse effect on the market price of the related digital asset. Digital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital assets. The value of ETHE and ETH relates directly to the value of the underlying digital asset, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors.\n\nA registration statement related to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. An investment in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust cannot be made, nor money accepted, until the registration statement is effective. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust carefully before investing.

The value of the shares is closely tied to acceptance, industry developments, and governance changes, making them susceptible to market sentiment. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the value of the Shares depends on their acceptance. Changes in the governance of a digital asset network may not receive sufficient support from users and miners, which may negatively affect that digital asset network\u2019s ability to grow and respond to challenges Investing in the Trust comes with risks that could impact the Trust's share value, including large-scale sales by major investors, security threats like breaches and hacking, negative sentiment among speculators, and competition from central bank digital currencies and financial initiatives using blockchain technology. A disruption of the internet or a digital asset network would affect the ability to transfer digital assets and, consequently, would impact their value.

        "content": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nSpot ether exchange traded funds are set to begin trading on Tuesday. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful it will broaden the investor base for Ethereum, a blockchain technology many argue has a far wider use case than bitcoin. These ETFs will invest directly in ether, which is the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum network. There are already ether ETFs that track futures contracts, but these are the first to track spot ether. Spot ether ETF applications Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH)\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)\n\nBitwise Ethereum (ETHW)\n\nVanEck Ethereum (ETHV)\n\n21Shares Core Ethereum (CETH)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Ethereum (QETH)\n\nFidelity Ethereum (FETH)\n\nFranklin Ethereum (EZET)\n\niShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) Like the spot bitcoin ETFs that launched in January, most are waiving fees initially \u2014 in many cases for up to a year.\n\nBitcoin ETF have been a hit. Will ether ETFs be the same?\n\nBy the standards of ETF launches, spot bitcoin ETFs have been a success: They recently topped $17 billion in net flows year to date since their debut. For a new asset class, that is a big hit. However, at $1.3 trillion in total assets, bitcoin has about three times the value of ether, which has about $414 billion in assets. That may limit the initial appeal of ether ETFs. Bitcoin prices rose going into the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Ether has been a bit spottier: It is up 50% in 2024, but most of the gain came in the first three months of the year. Still, for Ethereum enthusiasts, the primary value of a spot ether ETF is that it's a perfect vehicle to educate the public about the use cases for Ethereum, which are far greater than anything bitcoin has to offer. Ben Johnson, Morningstar's head of client solutions and an ETF research veteran, noted that while bitcoin is often advertised as digital gold, \"Ethereum is more like picks and shovels.\" \"The case for the former is that it is finite and could be a store of value, the latter is not finite and being used to build some real-world applications,\" he said.\n\nWhat the Ethereum platform does\n\nMany investors have never been impressed with bitcoin, primarily because the use case seems limited: It is purely a digital currency. But the Ethereum platform is different. Bitcoin and Ethereum both utilize blockchain, which is a decentralized, immutable ledger to record transaction histories, but they have very different purposes. Bitcoin uses the blockchain as a digital currency. Ethereum utilizes digital money just like bitcoin, but its blockchain has broader purposes. (Ether is the cryptocurrency used in the Ethereum network, but in practice the terms Ethereum and ether are often used interchangeably.) Ethereum is a platform for building smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that enforce a pre-existing contract or agreement. It can be as simple as \"If I do this, you do that.\" The key is that they execute automatically, are done on the blockchain (the Ethereum network) and produce the same result each time they are executed. They also have a wide variety of applications. The most common use is for decentralized finance, or \"DeFi.\" This is just a fancy term for using financial services on the blockchain. In theory, you could perform almost any banking services: Users can send, lend or borrow money, open a savings account, trade stocks or derivatives or other cryptocurrencies, get insurance. Theoretically, you could also do real estate transactions. Users can perform these functions using software called \"decentralized apps.\" The use case goes beyond financial services. Users can play games. Corporations could use it for tracking supply chains. It could even be used as a clearing platform to settle stock trades. Another application for Ethereum: stablecoins. These are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another asset, usually the dollar. Because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are volatile, many DeFi applications rely on stablecoins for lending, borrowing and trading. The promise is a transaction network that \u2014 in theory \u2014 could be a much cheaper and faster way to do business.\n\nDoes this open the floodgates for more crypto ETFs?\n\nIt's not clear whether this latest development will open the floodgates for more crypto ETFs \u2014 or whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will find a way to stop the potential tidal wave. Any applicant for other crypto ETFs would still need to show that the underlying market was not subject to manipulation, a crucial requirement for approval of these funds. But a lot may depend on the political climate. In the past, for commodities, the SEC has traditionally required a regulated futures market to trade alongside the asset. Right now, that only exists for bitcoin and ether, so it would take time to develop futures markets for other crypto products. \"Under the current regime in Washington, that would not change,\" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise told me. \"But if you get a change of regimes in Washington, that could change.\" Regardless, expect a lot of trading. \"These new ETH ETFs will likely trade a lot,\" Johnson at Morningstar told me. \"I'd guess that if and when options on these ETFs become available, this will all go into overdrive.... These ETFs effectively add a whole new wing to the crypto casino.\"\n\nIs Ethereum essentially a tech play?"

        "content": "Key Takeaways The U.S. SEC has approved spot ether ETFs to likely begin trading on Tuesday.\n\nSpot ether ETFs have been assumed to begin trading this summer since the SEC first reversed course on the matter in May.\n\nAccording to one analyst, 20-25% of the inflows seen by the spot bitcoin ETFs this year are expected to be seen in the spot ether ETFs.\n\nQuestions still remain regarding the legal status of ether when it is staked.\n\nMany spot ether exchange traded funds (ETFs) will likely begin trading Tuesday, July 23, 2024 after receiving a final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEther (ETH) is the underlying cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, which is the second-largest crypto network when measured by market cap.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the following spot ether ETFs had effective prospectuses, meaning the SEC had cleared them for trading:\n\n21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH)\n\nBitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW)\n\nFidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH)\n\nFranklin Ethereum Trust (EZET)\n\n\n\nInvesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH)\n\niShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA)\n\nVanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV)\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH)\n\nEther was up about 2.6% as of 5:45 a.m. ET Tuesday.\n\n\n\nOptimism Around Spot Ether ETFs\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs that began trading in January have fueled demand for bitcoin (BTC) and were partially responsible for sending bitcoin to record-highs in March.\n\nSpot ether ETFs are likely to see around 20% to 25% of the flows spot bitcoin ETFs saw in their first few months of existence, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart previously told Investopedia.\n\nEther ETFs could drive ether prices to a record above $5,000, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, wrote in recent commentary. Hougan has predicted that the new ETFs will garner up to $15 billion in new assets over 18 months.\n\nQuestions Around Staking Remain\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain works on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for its operations such as reconciling and recording transactions on the network.\n\nUnlike the proof-of-work mechanism followed by the Bitcoin network where millions of nodes compete for rewards from being the first to verify blocks, Ethereum relies on staking. Staking is a process by which ether holders pledge their crypto tokens to 'validators' who then participate in the transaction verification. The ether owners earn a reward in exchange for locking up their tokens.\n\nThe SEC has in the past raised the question whether ether is a security under its purview, though it has not expressly classified it as one. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classifies both bitcoin and ether as commodities.\n\nThe reason this classification matters: The SEC in the past has also considered staking as a securities offering. The SEC recently sued blockchain technology firm Consensys for offering access to staked ether via their MetaMask wallet.\n\n\n\nThat's probably why for now, none of the spot Ether ETFs will be able to stake the ether they hold, even at the expense of higher returns for investors.\n\n\"I think certainly something like staking, or any feature of the product\u2014we saw that on the bitcoin exchange traded products too, there were features of the product that some people would have liked to see included but weren't, those are always open for reconsideration as far as I'm concerned, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce told Coinage media in a interview.\n\nUPDATE\u2014This story has been updated following SEC approval of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust.\n\nCorrection, July 23, 2024\u2014This story has been corrected to reflect the accurate date that spot ether ETFs begin trading."

Previously, investing directly in cryptocurrencies required navigating unregulated exchanges or managing digital wallets, which could be challenging for traditional investors. By providing a regulated avenue for investment, these ETFs lower the barrier to entry.\n\nThis development is also likely to attract institutional investors who have been hesitant to invest directly in cryptocurrencies due to regulatory uncertainties. Additionally, industry experts and analysts believe the launch of these ETFs could influence the broader cryptocurrency market, increasing demand for Ethereum ($ETH) and potentially impacting price and liquidity.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision also sets a regulatory precedent that may affect future approvals of other cryptocurrency-related financial products. Finally, these ETFs offer a simplified investment process and increased security through regulated financial products, making it easier for investors to gain exposure to the asset without directly holding the cryptocurrency."

Trading of these ETFs is scheduled to start today at 9:30 AM EDT. At the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price stands at approximately $3,525, up 1% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nWhile some analysts predict these ETFs could see inflows of up to $5.4 billion in the first six months, algorithmic trading firm Wintermute offers a more conservative outlook. The firm forecasts lower-than-anticipated demand, projecting inflows closer to $3.2 to $4 billion. Wintermute expects Ethereum ETFs to see 15% to 20% of the flow observed for Bitcoin ETFs, potentially leading to an 18% to 24% price increase for ETH.\n\nTwo factors for \u2018muted demand\u2019 on Ethereum ETFs\n\nWintermute attributes its less optimistic forecast to two key factors.\n\nPrimarily, the absence of a staking mechanism within the ETFs may diminish Ethereum\u2019s appeal as an investment vehicle. Staking, a core component of Ethereum\u2019s security model since its shift to proof-of-stake in 2022, allows users to earn rewards by delegating tokens to the network.\n\nThe inability to stake Ethereum within these ETFs could make them less attractive to yield-seeking investors. Crypto Briefing\u2019s previous coverages on this matter explain the nuances in detail.\n\nWintermute also cites the lack of a shared narrative to attract investors as a potential hurdle for Ether ETFs. Unlike Bitcoin, which has successfully tapped into the \u201cdigital gold\u201d narrative, Ethereum\u2019s more complex ecosystem and diverse applications may make it challenging to present a unified investment thesis to potential ETF buyers.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum\u2019s dual functionality as both a digital currency and a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts may appeal to investors interested in technological innovations and diverse blockchain applications, Wintermute claims. The launch of Ethereum ETFs represents a significant step in making crypto investments more accessible to mainstream investors, potentially impacting both the crypto market and the broader financial landscape."

        "content": "The supply of ether has been growing non-stop since April. Will the weakening of the \u201cultrasound money\u201d narrative hurt ETF inflows?\n\nTuesday marks a historic milestone for crypto as Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs begin trading in the U.S. for the first time. The SEC\u2019s approval has enabled major financial institutions such as Fidelity and BlackRock to offer these regulated investment products, letting U.S. investors invest in ETH more easily and likely increasing demand.\n\nHowever, this significant event coincides with growing concerns about Ethereum\u2019s increasing supply.\n\nSince the Dencun upgrade in March, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy has undergone a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d according to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant. The upgrade was all about making it cheap to transact in Ethereum layer 2s, such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum. It was widely successful in that regard since transacting on an L2 now costs a fraction of what it used to. But it has come at a great cost to ETH tokenomics. \u201cThis upgrade fundamentally changed ETH\u2019s monetary policy and its supply trajectory,\u201d wrote CryptoQuant in a new report seen by Unchained.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Scaling With L2s Has Damaged Its Tokenomics. Is It Possible to Fix It?\n\nSince April, Ethereum\u2019s total supply has been increasing, and now stands at 120.2 million ETH, the highest level since Nov. 2023. The primary cause of this increase is the reduced burning of ETH due to declining activity in the Layer 1, leading to reduced transaction fees. This shift has resulted in Ethereum losing its \u201cultrasound money\u201d narrative, which suggested that ETH could become deflationary by actively reducing its supply over time.\n\nIn the past 30 days, ETH supply has increased by 59,312 ETH (over $200 million at current prices), according to data from the ultrasound.money dashboard. If the supply of ETH keeps increasing at this rate, the supply will be back to what it was at The Merge (the moment when Ethereum transitioned from a proof of work consensus mechanism to a proof of stake one), as noted on X recently by Benjamin Cowen, the CEO and founder of the Into the Cryptoverse newsletter.\n\nHowever, the report from CryptoQuant highlights one positive note: the amount of staked ETH has reached a record high. Approximately 33.7 million ETH, or 28% of the total supply, is now staked. This staked ETH is effectively removed from circulation, potentially reducing selling pressure and supporting the price of ETH. Additionally, market indicators suggest that ETH\u2019s price may have bottomed out, showing signs of a potential upward trend, the report claims."

The trading price of the ether held by the Fund may go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of the Fund\u2019s Shares relates directly to the value of ether, which has been in the past, and may continue to be, highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors. Extreme volatility in the future, including substantial, sustained or rapid declines in the trading prices of ether, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value.\n\nCompetitive pressures may negatively affect the ability of the Fund to garner substantial assets and achieve commercial success.\n\nDigital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the value of the Fund\u2019s Shares depends on the acceptance of ether. Due to the relative unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of digital asset exchanges, which may experience fraud, manipulation, security failures or operational problems, as well as the wider ether market, the value of ether and, consequently, the value of the Shares may be adversely affected, causing losses to Shareholders.\n\nDigital asset markets in the U.S. exist in a state of regulatory uncertainty, and adverse legislative or regulatory developments could significantly harm the value of ether or the Shares, such as by banning, restricting or imposing onerous conditions or prohibitions on the use of ether, validation activity, digital wallets, the provision of services related to trading and custodying ether, the operation of the Ethereum network, or the digital asset markets generally.\n\nThe Index price used to calculate the value of the Fund\u2019s ether has a limited performance history and may be volatile, adversely affecting the value of the Shares.

Also, the Fund does not use any hedging techniques to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from ether price decreases. The Fund is not a leveraged product and does not utilize leverage, derivatives or similar instruments or transactions. The Fund's Shares are not interests or obligations of the Fund's Sponsor or its affiliates, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.\n\nThe amount of ether represented by each Share will decrease over the life of the Fund due to the sales of ether necessary to pay the Sponsor\u2019s Fee and other Fund expenses. Without increases in the price of ether sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the Shares will also decline and you will lose money on your investment in Shares.\n\nSecurity threats to the Fund\u2019s account at the Ether Custodian or Prime Broker could result in the halting of Fund operations and a loss of Fund assets or damage to the reputation of the Fund, each of which could result in a reduction in the value of the Shares.\n\nThe Fund will not stake the ether it holds, so an investment in the Fund\u2019s shares will not realize the economic benefits of staking.\n\nIf the process of creation and redemption of Creation Units encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactions by Authorized Participants intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of ether may not exist and, as a result, the price of the Shares may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV.\n\nFranklin Distributors, LLC.

        "title": "SEC approves ether ETFs as crypto moves closer to mainstream - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot ethereum exchange traded funds, another landmark for cryptocurrency advocates and investors following the debut of bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThe nine ether ETFs, including the conversion of a $9.3bn Grayscale Investments trust and new launches from bitcoin ETF giants BlackRock and Fidelity, gained approval from the SEC on Monday afternoon, and trading began on Tuesday morning. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain and is the second-largest crypto token in the world behind bitcoin with a market capitalisation of about $415bn. The price of ether ticked up about 1 per cent after trading began on Tuesday and is up more than 47 per cent since January 1.\n\nThe approvals, which follow those of ether futures ETFs last year, give crypto a firmer toehold in traditional US finance after January\u2019s launch of the first US spot bitcoin ETFs. The price of bitcoin was up more than 51 per cent year to date on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cTraditional asset management can no longer ignore crypto as an asset class,\u201d said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of crypto fund sponsor Bitwise. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see effectively everyone embrace this space.\u201d\n\nCboe Global Markets, which lists five of the ether ETFs, said initial trading showed \u201cgood market quality\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll products opened for trading smoothly, with strong participation from our dedicated market makers who have been actively quoting and providing liquidity from the outset,\u201d Cboe said in a statement.\n\nAs was the case with bitcoin, ethereum ETF issuers are jostling for investor interest with a relatively tight range of fees. Final expenses for all but one of the products would be below 0.25 per cent, with at least five issuers planning to entirely waive fees at first, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThere is a glaring exception in the pricing war: Grayscale will keep in place the 2.5 per cent management fee for its large converted ethereum ETF while seeding a \u201cmini\u201d version with 10 per cent of the larger ETF\u2019s assets. The smaller sibling is expected to have the lowest post-waiver fee of the initial ether ETFs at 0.15 per cent.\n\nGrayscale in January also kept the fee for its bitcoin ETF management fee at 1.5 per cent \u2014 down from 2 per cent initially, but still way above its competitors. That decision has generated $160mn in fee revenue for Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin ETF so far in 2024, the third-highest of any US ETF and good for 2 per cent of all US ETF revenue, according to Bryan Armour, Morningstar\u2019s director of passive strategies research.\n\nThese ether products are not initially expected to bring in as many assets as the bitcoin ETFs into which investors have put more than $17bn in new money over the past six months since their launch.\n\nWhile the ethereum blockchain has a wide range of uses beyond storing value, investors might not be able to wrap their heads around it as opposed to bitcoin\u2019s common reference point as \u201cdigital gold\u201d, said Tim Ogilvie, global head of institutional with Kraken, a US cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised if you saw a similar explosive start for ETH,\u201d Ogilvie said.\n\nHougan has predicted that ether ETFs would attract about $15bn over their first 18 months on the market. He added that flows into the new funds \u201ccould be a little squirrelly\u201d in the summer."

This development comes less than three months after spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in January.\n\nEight issuers are offering spot Ethereum ETFs with varying fee structures:\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (NYSE: ETH): 0.15% post-waiver fee\n\nFranklin Ethereum ETF (CBOE: EZET): 0.19%\n\nVanEck Ethereum ETF (CBOE: ETHV): 0.20%\n\nBitwise Ethereum ETF (NYSE: ETHW): 0.20%\n\n21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CBOE: CETH): 0.21%\n\nFidelity Ethereum Fund (CBOE: FETH): 0.25%\n\niShare Ethereum Trust (NASDAQ: ETHA): 0.25%\n\nInvesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (CBOE: QETH): 0.25%\n\nAdditionally, Grayscale\u2019s existing Ethereum Trust (NYSE: ETHE) will continue trading with a 2.5% fee. Six of the funds will use Coinbase as a custodian, while VanEck has chosen Gemini and Fidelity will self-custody its ether.\n\nAnalysts project more modest inflows for Ethereum ETFs compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. Citigroup estimates between $4.7 billion and $5.4 billion in inflows over the first six months of trading. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, suggests Ethereum ETF demand may reach about one-third of what was seen with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe ETFs are available to both institutional investors and retail traders. Notably, six of these funds have chosen Coinbase as their custodian, with others opting for different custody solutions. The trading platforms and their respective fees vary, with the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF among those listed.\n\nComparatively, Ethereum ETFs are expected to see lower initial inflows than their Bitcoin counterparts, with projections suggesting up to $1 billion in net inflows monthly for the first half-year. Despite the smaller market size relative to Bitcoin, the introduction of these ETFs is poised to provide a new avenue for cryptocurrency investment."

        "content": "Today, Ethereum ETFs made their long-awaited debut on major stock exchanges. This article will analyze projected inflows for Ethereum ETFs and how they might influence the future price of ETH. By comparing the recent success of Bitcoin ETFs, we will explore the potential impact on Ethereum prices in the coming months.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin ETF inflows and their implications for Ethereum\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs have seen substantial inflows, expectations for Ethereum ETFs are more modest. Since their inception, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted significant investor interest. As of July 18, these financial instruments saw a net inflow of $16.67 billion over approximately six months. Despite being the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum is often perceived differently from Bitcoin. It is not typically seen as a store of value or \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This distinction, combined with Bitcoin\u2019s more established market position, suggests that Ethereum may not attract the same level of ETF inflows as Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has provided conservative estimates for Ethereum ETF inflows and believes that these funds will attract only 10-15% of the inflows seen by Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nI think me comparing Ether ETFs following Bitcoin ETFs to a concert where Sister Hazel comes on after Nirvana is prob why a few ppl coming at me on this and that's ok. Maybe that was harsh but I still see the ether etfs getting 10-15% of the assets of the btc ETFs (altho James is\u2026 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 21, 2024\n\nYou might also like: Election politics or crypto evolution? Speculation abounds as SEC hints at approving Ethereum ETFs\n\nAdditionally, when looking at the derivatives market, the open interest for Ethereum futures and options on the CME is approximately $1.67 billion, while Bitcoin\u2019s open interest stands at $12.56 billion. The CME, which mainly serves institutional investors, shows that Ethereum\u2019s share is about 13.3% of Bitcoin\u2019s. In the broader derivatives market, Ethereum\u2019s total open interest is $20.74 billion compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $54.1 billion, which translates to a 38.34% ratio. These figures reinforce the conservative projections for Ethereum ETF inflows compared to Bitcoin.\n\nAcademic insights into ETF effects on market prices\n\nA question often arises: why would ETF inflows impact the price of an underlying asset, such as Ethereum? Several academic studies have confirmed ETFs\u2019 significant influence on underlying asset prices. Research by Ben-David et al. (2018) demonstrates that ETFs can lead to increased volatility and price deviations from fundamental values in the securities they track. The study attributes these effects to the mechanical rebalancing and trading strategies employed by ETFs, which can amplify price movements and introduce non-fundamental shocks into the market.\n\nFurther supporting evidence comes from Luca J. Liebi\u2019s literature review. The research highlights ETFs\u2019 role in improving market liquidity and price efficiency under normal conditions. Empirical evidence suggests that ETFs, particularly those with high leverage, can magnify price changes in underlying assets due to their rebalancing activities. These studies collectively indicate that ETF inflows tend to push up the prices of the assets they track, lending credence to the hypothesis that Ethereum ETFs could similarly impact ETH prices.\n\nPotential inflow scenarios for Ethereum ETFs\n\nBased on the analysis above, four potential scenarios for Ethereum ETF inflows emerge:\n\nPercentage of Bitcoin ETF Inflows Ethereum ETF Inflows 10% $1.67B 15% $2.50B 20% $3.33B 25% $4.17B\n\nThese projections estimate the potential inflows Ethereum ETFs might experience by the end of 2024, using the $16.668 billion figure for Bitcoin as a baseline.\n\nEthereum price impact analysis\n\nTo estimate the price impact of these potential inflows, four multipliers are considered: 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x. These multipliers reflect varying degrees of price sensitivity to ETF inflows.\n\n10% 15% 20% 25% 0.5x $3,570 $3,655 $3,740 $3,825 1x $3,740 $3,910 $4,080 $4,250 1.5x $3,910 $4,165 $4,420 $4,675 2x $4,080 $4,420 $4,760 $5,100\n\nAssuming a current Ethereum price of $3,400, the estimated price impact by the end of 2024, solely from ETF inflows, would range from $170 to $1,700. With more likely multipliers (1x to 1.5x), the price increase would be between $340 and $1,275. This suggests a potential Ethereum price range of $3,740 to $4,675."

        "content": "Why Savvy Investors Are Turning to Ethereum ETFs After SEC Approval\n\nThe SEC's approval of Ethereum ETFs marks a new era for wealth-building in the crypto market. Investors can now trade Ethereum\u2019s ether through spot exchange-traded funds, following the significant milestone of Bitcoin ETFs' approval in January.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted final approval for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold Ethereum\u2019s ether (ETH), marking a significant milestone for the crypto market. With this decision, American investors now have access to a second major cryptocurrency through easily tradable vehicles, following the earlier approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January.\n\nEthereum ETFs: A Gateway to Crypto Investment\n\nPackaging Ethereum in an ETF wrapper is expected to make it more appealing to conventional investors, who can now buy and sell these funds through traditional brokerage accounts. Since their debut earlier this year, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted substantial investment, and experts predict a similar trend for Ethereum ETFs. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve now fully entered the ETF era of crypto. Investors can now access more than 70% of the liquid crypto asset market through low-cost ETPs.\u201d Hougan says he expects the first few weeks could be choppy, \u201cas money may flow out of the $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) after it converts to an ETP,\u201d although he expects a new ETH all-time high by the end of the year.\n\nAs noted, the conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETF will be a crucial development. ETHE, which offers institutional investors exposure to ETH, previously enforced a six-month lock-up period on its shares. With the transition to an ETF structure, traders can buy and sell more easily. The narrowing discount of ETHE to net asset value suggests that investors who bought Ethereum below par may redeem shares at NAV price upon conversion.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin ETFs: A Comparison\n\nAnalysts often compare Bitcoin to \u201cdigital gold\u201d and describe Ethereum to the \u201copen-source App Store.\u201d While Bitcoin serves as a store of value, Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology enables a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps). Investors seeking exposure to the thousands of applications utilizing blockchain technology are likely to find Ethereum ETFs appealing.\n\nPrice Sensitivity and Inflows\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year significantly impacted BTC\u2019s price, driving it to new all-time highs. Now, attention turns to Ethereum. Crypto analytics firm Kaiko suggests that ETH\u2019s price will be \u201csensitive\u201d to inflows from the newly approved ETFs. Investors are keenly watching the potential impact on the market, especially considering the underwhelming demand for futures-based ETH ETFs launched in late 2023.\n\nBlackRock and Other Asset Managers Join the Fray\n\nAsset management giant BlackRock is actively preparing for the launch of its ETH ETF. The fee structure for BlackRock\u2019s Ether ETF indicates its commitment to establishing a competitive presence in the emerging market. Other asset managers are following suit, each offering varied fee structures to attract investors.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nAs Ethereum ETFs begin trading, the crypto community eagerly awaits their impact on prices and broader altcoin markets. For example, a potential driver for Solana\u2019s alpha momentum in the last week may be an indication that following Ether\u2019s spot ETF launch, SOL may be next in line. Eric Balchunas, a popular Bloomberg ETF analyst who has often been the first to break pertinent news and information wrote on X last week, that after the ETH ETF launch \u201cthen Solana, and then.. it\u2019s prob never going to end. The dam has broken.\u201d His tweet didn\u2019t just create momentum for ETH, but also for a few other large-cap alts like Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nIndeed, investor confidence in the broader altcoin market may also receive a boost. As Ethereum gains more mainstream exposure through ETFs, other altcoins could benefit from increased attention and investment. At the same time the interplay between Bitcoin and Ethereum prices will be closely watched, as both cryptocurrencies often influence each other.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs opens new avenues for investors, potentially reshaping the crypto landscape. Whether ETH\u2019s price reaches $4,000 remains to be seen, but the crypto ETF era has undoubtedly arrived."

Notices posted on Cboe\u2019s website on Friday announced the listing of multiple spot Ethereum ETFs. The ETFs set to begin trading include the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), and VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV).\n\nThis move follows the unexpected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, a surprising shift from the regulator's previous scrutiny of Ethereum-focused firms. The approval came just four months after the first spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the United States. Each listing states, \"We are pleased to announce that One (1) Exchange Traded Product ('ETP') will be listed on Cboe and will begin trading as a new issue on July 23, 2024, pending regulatory effectiveness.\"\n\nEthereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has seen significant interest from investors. The approval and upcoming trading of these ETFs are expected to further boost Ethereum's accessibility among traditional investors. According to CoinMarketCap data, ETH is currently trading at $3,529, rebounding from a dip following the sudden news of President Joe Biden exiting the Presidential race. ETH is up 6.21% over the past week.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s initial approvals in May marked a turning point, as the regulator had previously been cautious about Ethereum, seemingly treating it differently from Bitcoin. However, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs likely influenced the SEC\u2019s decision to extend similar approvals to Ethereum ETFs. The SEC recently dropped its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, paving the way for greater regulatory clarity on the second-largest cryptocurrency."

This transition is part of the preparations for the new fund, which is expected to become active on Wednesday, with ETHE holders receiving proportional ETF positions.\n\nDespite maintaining a 2.5% fee on ETHE, which is higher than its competition, Grayscale\u2019s strategy seems to be aimed at retaining more assets under its management by offering the lower-cost ETH ticker.\n\nFollowing the SEC approval for Spot Ethereum to commence trading, Wintermute, an algorithmic trading firm, predicted that demand for Ethereum ETFs might be lower than anticipated.\n\nHowever, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, remains optimistic and has projected that Ethereum ETFs could reach $15 billion within the first 18 months of trading.\n\nMoreover, Grayscale is just one among several major investment firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, preparing to launch Ethereum ETFs, with demand for these funds projected to be between $3.2 billion and $4 billion."

        "title": "Ether ETFs Make Their Bow, With Uncertainty Ahead - PaymentsJournal",
        "content": "Five spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) are slated to begin trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. They follow the nine bitcoin ETFs that began selling earlier this year as the only two cryptocurrency plays available to investors on the regular stock market.\n\nThe new ETFs include the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF. To jumpstart the introduction, virtually all of the ETH ETF issuers have announced plans to temporarily waive or discount their fees. The discounts run from 50% fee reductions to full waivers and will be in place anywhere from six months to a year.\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs have been highly successful, with more than $17 billion in net inflows since their introduction. The ether ETFs will face an uphill climb in replicating that success, with some industry experts expecting them to garner anywhere between 10% and 20% of the inflows garnered by the bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAs a less widely traded asset, ether is expected to endure more price volatility than bitcoin. As the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, ether has a market cap of just over $400 billion, while bitcoin\u2019s market cap is well over $1 trillion. Analysts looking at the ether ETFs are expecting significant price fluctuations after the introduction. For instance, data from research firm Deribit shows that the implied volatility of ether options rose from 56% to 70% in the past week.\n\nNot Mined but Staked\n\nOne key difference between the two cryptocurrencies is that bitcoin is mined, while Ethereum has switched to staking. In September 2022, Ethereum replaced its energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining mechanism with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism rooted more in financial transactions. Technically speaking, Ethereum is the blockchain platform, while ether is the cryptocurrency derived from that platform.\n\nThis change transformed how new Ethereum is created, making traditional mining obsolete. Staking involves committing ether as collateral to validate transactions on the Ethereum network, which allows you to earn more ether.\n\nOne upshot of the ether ETFs is that they will almost certainly increase demand for the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to a severe supply shortage. The Ethereum Exchange Reserve, which tracks the amount of ether available on cryptocurrency exchanges, is already at multi-year lows."

        "title": "Superstate launches high yield carry fund for Bitcoin and Ethereum using tokens - Fortune",
        "content": "For crypto traders, there has long been an arbitrage opportunity in the spread between the price of Bitcoin in the futures market\u2014which is typically more bullish\u2014and the spot market price. The trouble is that taking advantage of this corner of finance, which is known as the cash-and-carry or basis trade, requires considerable time and attention. That\u2019s why Superstate, a crypto firm that specializes in tokenizing conventional financial services, has created its new Crypto Carry Fund that lets wealthy investors get exposure to spreads in the spot and futures market in the form of an Ethereum ERC-20 token.\n\nSuperstate was founded by Robert Leshner, a former banker who is well regarded in the crypto world for building Compound, one of the first and most successful DeFi platforms. In an interview with Fortune, Leshner said some sophisticated investors have for years earned a yield premium on the arbitrage opportunity in spot and future crypto prices. But by creating a token to carry out the trade, he says, Superstate has made the process more accessible\u2014and also more liquid since traders will be able to swap the tokens\u2014known as USCC\u2014with each other.\n\nSuperstate raised $14 million late last year, and launched its first fund in early 2024, offering tokenized versions of familiar products like Treasury Bills. The new Crypto Carry fund will primarily invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum arbitrage opportunities but, during times when the spread does not offer a problem, will put investors\u2019 money in T-bills and other safe investments instead. Unlike hedge funds, there is no lock-in and returns will be available on a daily basis.\n\nSuperstate co-founder Jim Hiltner says the new Superstate fund will charge customers a fee of 75 basis points, and added this a better deal for investors than seeking exposure to the crypto carry trade through hedge funds, which charge a so-called two-and-twenty rate. Hiltner also stated that the fund is structured so that it will not be vulnerable to margin calls, and that it will carry a cash buffer in any case.\n\nThe biggest catch for most investors is that the new fund is only open to so-called qualified purchasers who have $5 million in assets, while the lowest buy-in is for $100,000. The Superstate founders say they hope that, in time, the assets will become more broadly accessible but that, for now, the new fund is groundbreaking because it is totally compliant with existing U.S. regulations.\n\nIn the bigger picture, SuperState is at the vanguard of a growing corner of the crypto industry that seeks to tokenize conventional assets. While firms, including banks, have dabbled with the idea of \u201creal world assets\u201d on the blockchain for years, the idea appears to be finally gaming momentum as Wall Street comes to fully embrace crypto. Indeed, giants of traditional finance are making a push, including Goldman Sachs, which says it will launch three tokenization projects by the end of the year.\n\nLeshner notes that SuperState\u2019s first fund has already amassed $100 million in assets, and that some big names from traditional finance will soon join a recently-launched industry council dedicated to tokenizing real world assets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting exactly the traction we wanted,\u201d says Leshner. \u201cMore important than AUM is that intermediaries such as prime brokers are getting wired into crypto.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways Spot ether ETFs will start trading on U.S. exchanges Tuesday. Nine ETFs will be traded on the Cboe BZX, Nasdaq, and NYSE Arca.\n\nThe ether ETFs give investors price exposure to their underlying assets.\n\nFees on these new ETFs generally range from 0.15% to 0.25%.\n\nThese ETFs do not come with exposure to Ethereum staking.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved nine spot ether (ETH)exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for trading on U.S. exchanges. Trading for these new crypto investment vehicles will begin today. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhich new ether ETFs start trading today?\n\nThe spot ether ETFs that begin trading today can be found on Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX. Here is a breakdown of each ETF you can find on these three exchanges, in addition to the funds' tickers:\n\nCboe BZX will list the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET) and VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV).\n\nNasdaq will have the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) created by BlackRock, which also manages the largest spot bitcoin ETF under the IBIT ticker.\n\nNYSE Arca will list the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), which will also begin trading on the same exchange.\n\nHow does an ether ETF work?\n\nThe spot ether ETFs are intended to offer exposure to the price of the ether held by the funds. Ether is the underlying cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, the second-largest crypto network when measured by market cap.\n\nBuyers of the ETFs are purchasing shares of funds that hold ether on behalf of their shareholders. Different spot ether ETFs use different sources of data when it comes to pricing ether. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust, for one, uses the CoinDesk Ether Price Index.\n\nNone of the ETFs that will be launched today involve staked ether, which is a potential opportunity cost associated with opting for an ETF over other options, such as self-custody or a traditional crypto exchange.\n\nStaking ether currently has an annual return of 3.32%, according to the Compass Staking Yield Reference Index Ethereum. However, it's possible the SEC will eventually approve the staking of ether held by ETFs.\n\nHow can I trade ether ETFs?\n\nETFs can simplify investors' trading process. In the case of crypto, instead of taking full self-custody of ether and taking care of one's own private keys, the spot ether ETFs allow investors to purchase the underlying cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network via traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nNot all brokerages may offer spot crypto ETFs to their customers today.\n\nWhat are ether ETF fees?\n\nThe fees associated with each individual spot ether ETF were previously revealed in the S-1 or S-3 (depending on the specific ETF) filing associated with the offerings. These fees are 0.25% or lower for all but one.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which is being converted to an ETF, has a 2.5% fee. The Grayscale Mini Ethereum Trust has the lowest fee rate at 0.15%. These fees are charged on an annual basis for the provider's management of the fund and are in line with what was previously seen with the spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBrokerages may also charge their own fees for crypto trading."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a notable price surge Tuesday hours ahead of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) officially beginning to trade in the U.S..\n\nTrading for Grayscale\u2019s Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and its new Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) has already begun on the NYSE Arca, which opened at 4 a.m. Eastern Time. But trading for other spot Ethereum ETFs, like BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), will begin when the Nasdaq opens at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe price of ETH jumped from $3,450 to $3,541 over the course of an hour during European trading hours, following the confirmation from digital asset manager Grayscale that its two spot Ethereum ETFs would commence trading.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of the latest data, ETH is trading at $3,525, showing a 0.1% increase in the last 24 hours and a more substantial 4.5% gain over the past week.\n\nThe launch of Ethereum ETFs has generated significant interest in the crypto community, with various predictions about their potential impact on the market.\n\nCrypto market maker Wintermute forecasted that spot Ethereum ETFs could attract up to $4 billion in capital inflows over the next year, potentially driving the price of ETH up by 24%.\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hogan told Decrypt said he's heard traders doubting whether the new ETH funds will see much success\u2014but he's not buying it.\n\n\"Some people are skeptical that the Ethereum ETPs will be successful, and think the Bitcoin ETPs sucked up all the oxygen. They may be right,\" he said. \"But everywhere I look\u2014from the European ETF market to the Canadian ETF market to Coinbase and other exchanges\u2014when you give investors the choice to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum, they end up buying both. I'm not sure why things would be different here.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, Bitwise, one of the ETF issuers, announced its plans to donate 10% of the profits from its Ethereum spot ETF to Ethereum open source developers, saying it wants to highlight the importance of supporting the underlying technology and ecosystem.\n\nThe enthusiasm for the new ETH funds follows a recent surge in digital asset investment products.\n\nAccording to CoinShares' latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, the crypto market saw inflows of $1.35 billion last week, bringing the total inflows over the past three weeks to $3.2 billion.\n\nNotably, ETH funds have seen a string of weekly net outflows. But last week, ETH funds saw a reversal in their fortunes as investors deposited $45 million. That was enough to outpace Solana funds as the altcoin with the most inflows, year-to-date, at $103 million.\n\n\"The outlook for Ethereum seems to have turned a corner, seeing a further US$45m of inflows last week, overtaking Solana for the altcoin with the most inflows year-to-date,\u201d wrote James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares in a blog post.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETFs Expected to See a Fraction of Inflows Compared to Bitcoin Funds - Wealth Management",
        "content": "With the SEC\u2019s final authorization of spot Ethereum ETFs now official, trading of the ETFs is set to begin Tuesday morning. There is a buzz about the potential appeal of these new products. However, initial demand from RIAs is expected to be muted.\n\n\u201cWe think if the Ethereum product gets somewhere in the range of 20% of where the Bitcoin products are, that would be a good outcome,\u201d said Aniket Ullal, vice president of ETF data and analytics with research firm CFRA.\n\nRelated: Wealth Management EDGE: Bitcoin ETFs Are Winning Over Skeptics to Crypto\n\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency with a current market cap of approximately $416 billion, second only to Bitcoin, with a market cap of $1.32 trillion. The SEC provisionally approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs in May. The SEC asked the issuers to amend their S-1 filings before giving the final greenlight this afternoon.\n\nOn Friday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) posted notices that several Ethereum ETFs will begin trading on Tuesday, pending final SEC approval, which has now been received. The five funds listed by CBOE include Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH) and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH). The fees on these will range from 0.20% to 0.25%, with most of the issuers planning to waive the fees from six months to a year, depending on the investment amount.\n\nRelated: Several RIAs Take Big Stakes in Bitcoin ETFs\n\nIn addition, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, a futures-based Ethereum ETF (ETHE), would be converted to a spot product with a fee of 2.5%. (Grayscale has separately filed for the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), with a 0.15% expense ratio.) NYSE Arca, meanwhile, has approved both ETHE and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), with trading also beginning tomorrow. Meanwhile, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has been approved by NASDAQ.\n\nWhile market observers expect to see some demand for spot Ethereum ETFs from RIAs, it will likely trail the industry\u2019s appetite to date for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Ullal, there are at least two reasons for this. The first is that Bitcoin products tend to be a more popular choice among investors. Ullal noted that Bitcoin currently represents approximately 53% of the total crypto market, while Ethereum represents only 18%.\n\nIn addition, the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs has tended heavily toward individual investors and very small RIAs. CFRA has no way to gauge the exact breakdown of spot Bitcoin ETF investment between RIAs and individuals acting on their own, but a May analysis of 13F forms filed by asset managers with at least $100 million in AUM revealed they own roughly 15% to 20% of total Bitcoin ETFs shares outstanding. \u201cWe do know that it\u2019s very much a retail demand, just based on our conversations with investors and looking into 13Fs,\u201d said Ullal.\n\nSimilarly, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, forecasts that in the first year after their launch, spot Ethereum ETFs will likely amass a third of the assets that spot Bitcoin ETFs currently have. He noted that it would take time for RIAs to get comfortable with the product and for spot Ethereum ETFs to become available on wealth management platforms.\n\n\u201cThere will be less demand initially,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cOver the next year, we are expecting tens of billions of dollars to flow into these ETFs, but it won\u2019t be immediate. I expect Ethereum ETFs to have a third of the assets that the Bitcoin ETFs have and that reflects the current market cap. As advisors gain more knowledge about the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, the enthusiasm for Ethereum will grow.\u201d\n\nChris King, CEO of Eaglebrook Advisors, a crypto investment platform for RIAs that offers Ethereum and Bitcoin SMAs, agreed with that assessment. He said the majority of RIAs can\u2019t recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs right now, as there are still wealth management platforms that haven\u2019t approved them. As a result, the initial buy-in into Ethereum ETFs will likely come from self-directed retail investors and institutions.\n\n\u201cI think the majority of the initial flows, similar to Bitcoin ETFs, are not going to come from the wealth management channel or the advisor channel,\u201d King said. \u201cIn the short to medium term, it\u2019s not that demand is going to be low; it\u2019s that there is still going to be a little bit of friction to access.\u201d\n\nHowever, King said within about eight to 12 months, the majority of flows into spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETFs might start coming from the wealth channel. During that time, interest rates might fall, more wealth management platforms are likely to approve these ETFs, and upward price momentum is expected if current trends hold.\n\n\u201cI think there is going to be an increasing demand for risk assets, and crypto has typically been the fastest horse in the risk asset race, just like it was in 2020 and 2021,\" King said.\n\nRandy M. Long, a registered financial advisor with Long Family Office, based in Reedley, Calif., noted that his firm already has a positive outlook on spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe very much support these,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWe have invested our portfolios in GBTC and ETHE for a few years now, pretty much before any other firms of which I was aware.\u201d\n\nAccording to the independent research and consultancy firm ETFGI, at the end of June, global listed crypto ETFs and ETPs reported year-to-date inflows of $45.6 billion, the highest level on record and up from roughly $566.6 million during the same period the year before. The jump in inflows reflected the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. At mid-year, there were 68 Bitcoin ETFs/ETPs globally, with total assets of $65.97 billion and net new assets of $45.0 million year-to-date. There were 41 Ethereum ETFs/ETPs, with net new assets of $4.1 billion and net new assets of $116 million."

        "content": "The first-ever Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETFs have been greenlighted by the SEC and are set to begin trading tomorrow morning. Interestingly, two relatively lesser-known Ethereum-branded coins seem to have outperformed the marquee asset in 24-hour gains.\n\nWhat Happened: Ethereum Name Service popped more than 5%, emerging as the best-performing cryptocurrency in the last 24 hours. The coin's trading volume jumped 66% to $191 million, signaling significant buying activity.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum Classic popped 3% to hit a monthly high. ETC's trading volume nearly exploded 184% to $452 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded at 10:44 p.m. EDT) Ethereum Name Service ENS/USD +5.63% $28.08 Ethereum Classic ETC/USD +3.06% $24.78\n\nThese increases come despite a drop in Ethereum, which has lost 1.47% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Classic was created as a hard fork of the original Ethereum chain back in 2016 over disagreements within the community following a hack. The new chain inherited the name Ethereum as we know it, while the original one functions as Ethereum Classic.\n\nAdditionally, ENS is a token associated with Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized naming system that converts complex, machine-readable names to ones easily understandable by humans.\n\nSee Also: Dogecoin Up 15% In 7 Days And One Indicator Shows It May Be \u2018Primed For An Aggressive Up Move\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: ENS and ETC are fundamentally different from Ethereum, but many retail investors see them as cheaper alternatives.\n\nIt is worth noting that both ENS and ETC have much lower unit prices than ETH. So, while ETH gains popularity among institutions, individual investors may be tempted to shift their focus to lower-cap \u2018Ethereum\u2019 coins\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $67,503 trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:"

        "content": "Japanese car behemoth Toyota is considering incorporating Ethereum blockchain technology into its vehicles, according to a recent blog post written by Toyota Blockchain Lab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe car giant is conducting research on how to introduce mobility into public blockchains. The concept of mobility, which was originally announced back last April, aims to enhance the value of a car.\n\nThe blog post discussed some challenges of creating a blockchain account for a car. For instance, the account might be lost if the in-car device experiences a failure. The blockchain lab has proposed creating a mobility-oriented account based on the ERC-4337 Ethereum standard, which aims to improve wallet user experience with the help of account abstraction. The standard removes the need for seed phrase reliance while also enabling additional features such as multi-user operations. Car users, dealers, and administrative agencies could be involved in the transaction approval process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToyota Blockchain Lab has added that it is also \"excited\" about the EIP-7702 update that is set to improve the interoperability and efficiency of smart contracts. The update was proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin earlier this year in order to improve account abstraction.\n\nToyota is not new to the burgeoning blockchain space. In 2016, it became the very first member of the auto industry to become part of the consortium spearheaded by prominent enterprise blockchain firm R3. In 2019, the car giant launched its own blockchain lab in order to explore possible applications for the newfangled technology within the auto industry.\n\nLast year, Toyota also provided financial support for Astar Network, a Polkadot parachain."

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given final approval for several spot Ethereum ETFs, allowing them to begin trading on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nOn July 22, the SEC cleared the registration forms for spot Ethereum ETFs from 21Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy. Additionally, registration from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH Trust) were also approved.\n\nFirms had previously received SEC approval for their 19b-4 forms in May, which was a necessary step. However, they needed their registration statements to be finalized before launching.\n\nBloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has also confirmed the approval in a tweet:\n\nSpot Eth ETFs have been made effective by the SEC. The 424(b) forms are rolling in now, the last step = all systems go for tomorrow\u2019s 930am launch. Game on.\n\nEarlier this year, spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved and have since attracted billions of dollars in investment, with over $17 billion in total inflows. However, analysts suggest that Ethereum ETFs might attract less demand.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Ethereum\u2019s price dropped slightly by about 0.6%, currently trading at $3,443 according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nImage Source | CoinMarketCap\n\nThis drop in price seems to align with some analysts\u2019 predictions, such as Wintermute\u2019s projection, which expected \u201clower-than-expected demand\u201d for Ethereum ETFs. This suggests that the initial excitement for Ethereum ETFs may not lead to immediate, significant inflows, unlike the strong demand seen for spot Bitcoin ETFs."

Also, that\u2019s just the companies that reported this morning!\n\nTonight, we\u2019ll hear from Tesla, Alphabet, Visa, Texas Instruments, Enphase Energy, and others.\n\nPivoting to crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum are on investors\u2019 radar this morning as the Ethereum ETFs are set to begin trading today in the US.\n\nBitcoin ETFs began trading in January, but the outlook wasn\u2019t so great for Ethereum ETFs. However, in May the Securities and Exchange Commission made an unexpected move, opening the door for ETF approval later this summer.\n\nWell, that day is today. While analysts don\u2019t expect the Ethereum ETFs to be as popular as Bitcoin, they could see several billion dollars worth of inflows this year.\n\nFor context, Bitcoin ETFs have seen roughly $17 billion in inflows so far in 2024, garnering more than $1.25 billion last week and more than $3 billion over the last four weeks.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s an important and historic day for Ethereum as it finally joins the ETF party.\n\nWant to receive these insights straight to your inbox?\n\nSign up here\n\nThe setup \u2014 GE\n\nI have been watching GE for a while now, waiting for the stock to break out of its range. Will today be that day?\n\nGE reported earnings this morning, so investors will need to see how it holds up in today\u2019s trading session. For what it\u2019s worth, shares are trading higher in the pre-market after the firm beat earnings expectations.\n\nThe stock has been trapped in a trading range for a while now, finding support in the mid-$150s but being contained by downtrend resistance.\n\nIf GE can get above \u2014 and more importantly, stay above \u2014 downtrend resistance, it could open the door to its recent highs near $170, followed by potentially new 52-week highs.\n\nHowever, if GE stock fails to break out, support in the mid-$150s could be back in play. Below that and the selling pressure could accelerate.\n\nOptions\n\nFor some investors, options could be one alternative to speculate on GE. Remember, the risk for options buyers is tied to the premium paid for the option \u2014 and losing the premium is the full risk.\n\nBulls can utilize calls or call spreads to speculate on further upside, while bears can use puts or put spreads to speculate on the gains fizzling out and GE rolling over.\n\nFor those looking to learn more about options, consider visiting the eToro Academy.\n\nIf you want to upgrade your investing knowledge this summer, make sure to join our eToro Academy Learn & Earn Challenge, where you can take courses, pass quizzes, and earn up to $18 in rewards. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nWhat Wall Street is watching\n\nMAT \u2014 Mattel jumped after reports of a takeover offer from L Catterton, while Hasbro may also make a bid. Mattel stated confidence in its standalone strategy, denying any deal talks. Hasbro rose 2.3%, while L Catterton is backed by LVMH, which is reporting earnings today.\n\nGOOG \u2014 Talks between the privately held Wiz and Google parent Alphabet have reportedly broken down. The cloud security company has instead decided to pursue its goals of an IPO rather than come to terms on a $23 billion acquisition deal with Google \u2014 which would have marked the largest acquisition by Google to date.\n\nVZ \u2014 Verizon was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 100 yesterday, tumbling after reporting its Q2 results. Earnings of $1.15 per share were in-line with expectations, while revenue of $32.8 billion missed consensus estimates of $33.04 billion.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nPlease note that due to market volatility, some of the prices may have already been reached and scenarios played out."

        "content": "Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) have already surpassed $1 billion in cumulative trading volume on their first day in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would represent roughly one-fifth of the first-day volumes recorded by Bitcoin ETFs during their blockbuster debut in January.\n\nNotably, Grayscale's ETHE is leading the volume chart with $355 million. Some market participants are concerned about possible selling pressure that could be associated with the product's outflows. Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) comes in second place with $292 million. BlackRock's ETHA is at $187 million.\n\nEthereum, the leading altcoin by market cap, is currently trading at $3,466 on the Bitstamp exchange after dipping by 0.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the launch of Ethereum ETFs seems to be a sell-the-news event, the analysts are now waiting for first-day inflows that will provide them with definitive clues about the level of demand for these products. Coinbase researchers believe that stronger-than-expected inflows could be a bullish catalyst for the market (and vice versa).\n\nAs reported by U.Today , Seyffart and fellow analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that the much-hyped Ethereum ETFs would be able to record roughly $6 billion worth of inflows during the first year. This is a more optimistic prediction compared to the one from JPMorgan, whose analysts expected Ethereum ETFs to significantly underperform. These products might struggle to attract significant demand due to the absence of staking rewards.\n\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz described Ethereum ETFs as \"a game-changer\" for the entire crypto industry. \"It not only opens up access to the second-largest cryptocurrency but also delivers much-needed regulatory clarity, confirming that Ethereum is not a security,\" Novogratz added.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock recently highlighted Ethereum's ability to \"drive digital transformation\" in various industries."

He added: \u201cThis development highlights that crypto is not merely a trend; it illustrates the transformative digital shift in the financial system. We\u2019re proud to be the custodian for eight of the nine newly approved ETH ETFs, entrusted by many leading financial institutions as a reliable,safe, and secure partner.\u201d\n\nHistory often happen gradually, then suddenly. Crypto is no exception. The approval of spot ETH ETFs today is yet another one of those moments. And it validates what we\u2019ve been saying for years: ETH is not a security. https://t.co/1OGfaNr6ro \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) July 22, 2024\n\nThe SEC approved the launch of bitcoin EFTs in January this year when 10 new ETFs began trading and digital asset manager Grayscale Investments also converted its the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. In May this year the SEC also approved spot ethereum ETFs with market participants expecting trading to begin on 23 July 2024. Ether\u2019s $420bn market cap was second only to bitcoin\u2019s $1.3 trillion market cap as of 19 July 2024, according to data provider Morningstar.\n\nIssuers of ethereum ETFs have already listed bitcoin ETFs \u2013 Fidelity, iShares, Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale added Morningstar. The data provider said in a report that WisdomTree and Valkyrie are the two spot bitcoin issuers missing from the spot ethereum list, while 21Shares is issuing its ethereum ETF alone, after joining forces with Ark Invest on its bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments will convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into an ETF, as it did with its bitcoin trust.\n\nRegardless of your feelings about ether or crypto, this kind of first class TradFi treatment (translating benefits into Boomer-ese and and delivering it in the most preferred inv vehicle on Planet (the ETF) is a major deal.

The ETF carries a 0.25% sponsor fee with a one-year waiver reducing the fee to 0.12% on the first $2.5bn assets under management. The asset manager described ethereum, a global technology platform, as similar to an app store that generates value for ether as usage increases and more applications are built on top of it.\n\nJay Jacobs, U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs at BlackRock, said in a statement: \u201cOur clients are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital assets through exchange-traded products which provide convenient access, liquidity and transparency. Ethereum\u2019s appeal lies in its decentralized nature and its potential to drive digital transformation in finance and other industries.\u201d\n\nAnnouncement: Today, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) became the first U.S. ETP to publish its Ethereum addresses and set ENS subnames for each address. 1.ethw.bitwise.eth -> 0xa15c\u20262A69\n\n2.ethw.bitwise.eth -> 0xEd92\u2026b4eF\n\n3.ethw.bitwise.eth -> 0x3339\u20267cB5\n\n4.ethw.bitwise.eth\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SdOGiXkyqP \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) July 23, 2024\n\nMany of the largest tradfi asset managers in the world are launching crypto ETPs.

As a result, unlike bitcoin, holding ether directly could hold a meaningful performance edge over spot ether ETFs for investors willing to engage in staking.\n\nCrypto ETFs and ETPs listed globally gathered net inflows of $44.5bn through to the end of May this year according to ETFGI, the independent research and consultancy firm. ETFGI said in a report that this is a contrast to the $135.6m of net outflows at the same time last year.\n\nSubstantial inflows can be attributed to the top 20 ETFs/ETPs by net new assets, which collectively gathered $3.1bn during May according to ETFGI. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT US) had the largest individual net inflow of $1.2bn in May.\n\nBlockworks Research said in a report that the majority of the eight issuers filing for the ether ETF have set fees between 0.19% and 0.25%, with the exception of Grayscale. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF will maintain a fee of 2.5%, and the mini trust will offer a 0% fee for the first six months of trading, up to $2bn in assets under management. Then the mini trust will then charge 0.15%, undercutting all the competitors\u2019 currently advertised rates.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the mini trust will be seeded with 10% of trust\u2019s current AUM, and investors will receive a proportional distribution of the mini product at creation,\u201d added Blockworks. \u201cGrayscale is likely moving some of its client\u2019s capital into this lower fee product in an attempt to dampen the exodus of funds that was observed with bitcoin trust\u2019s conversion to an ETF. As trading begins, we\u2019ll get our first glimpse into how well this strategy may work for them.\u201d\n\nLaw firm Foley & Lardner said in a blog that the ether ETF approval is a significant milestone for increased institutional and retail investments in crypto ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe approval of these applications occurred without much resistance, which is a notable departure from the contentious process that preceded the approval of bitcoin ETFs,\u201d added the law firm.\n\nThe SEC was forced to approve bitcoin ETFs after losing a lawsuit against Grayscale Investments, which had challenged their previous rejections. However, the SEC approved ethereum ETFs without a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWhile this maneuver might have been to avoid more litigation and public scrutiny, the approval shows a steady departure from \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d and a movement toward actions that promote growth in the cryptocurrency industry and investor freedom,\u201d added the law firm.\n\nFoley & Lardner highlighted that the SEC noted the high correlation between spot ether prices and the CME\u2019s futures market. Morningstar also added that the SEC is unlikely to approve another spot cryptocurrency ETF without them first having a regulated market, which has so far been the CME futures market.\n\n\u201cThe CME doesn\u2019t currently list any other cryptocurrency futures,\u201d said Morningstar. \u201cIt stands to reason that ETF approval is distant for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and ethereum.\u201d\n\nInstitutional interest\n\nFoley & Lardner said: \u201cIn the coming years, it is very possible we will view the SEC\u2019s decision to approve ether ETFs as an important step in what became a trend of integrating cryptocurrency assets into traditional finance networks through ETFs and other financial instruments.\u201d\n\nCrypto ECN Finery Markets said in its second quarter over-the-counter (OTC) review that the recent approval of crypto-related vehicles has sparked institutional interest in adopting crypto for the long term, demonstrated by the increase in crypto OTC flows. In the first half of this year, the OTC institutional crypto market\u2019s total spot transaction volume rose 95% from the first six months of last year.\n\n\u201cThe approval of ETH ETFs may further drive institutional participation in the market,\u201d added Finery Markets \u201cHowever, we believe that the full impact of ETF approvals on the market may not be fully realized until six to nine months later, as it typically takes this amount of time for innovative products to be fully integrated into financial players\u2019 product portfolios and widely adopted.\u201d\n\nFinery Markets noted that the recent launch of a bitcoin ETF in Australia, and similar launches in the US and Hong Kong, reflect global interest in crypto investment vehicles. In addition, issuer VanEck\u2019s recent application for a Solana ETF highlights this growing trend.\n\nWe at @vaneck_us are pleased to announce that @CBOE just filed our 19b-4 to list and trade shares of the FIRST Solana exchange-traded fund in the US! We look forward to engaging with the SEC during the review period. \u2014 matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 8, 2024\n\n\u201cThese developments signify a changing regulatory environment that is becoming more favorable towards digital assets,\u201d added Finery. \u201cThis shift is important as it provides traditional financial institutions with a clear path to enter the crypto space using established financial instruments, taking advantage of current market conditions.\u201d\n\nFuture trends\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said:\n\nPrediction\u2026 An ETF issuer will file for combined spot btc, eth, & sol ETF in next few months. We\u2019re quickly heading down path towards index-based & actively managed crypto ETFs. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 22, 2024\n\nBrett Harrison, founder and chief executive of Architect Financial Technologies, said:\n\nNow that spot ETH ETFs are set to begin trading next week, a question remains \u2014 what is holding the SEC back from approving spot BTC ETF options? Options on BTC future ETFs were available within days of their underlying ETFs\u2019 listings, but to list options on spot commodity ETFs\u2026 \u2014 Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) July 17, 2024\n\nIn May this year the New York Stock Exchange said in a statement it is collaborating with CoinDesk Indices to launch cash-settled index options tracking the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which has been operating since 2014.\n\nThe XBX index benchmarks $20bn in ETF assets under management, and tracks the spot price of bitcoin, denominated in U.S. dollars, in real time across multiple crypto exchanges. It is calculated and published once per second, 24 hours per day, 365 days each year.\n\nAndy Baehr, head of product, CoinDesk Indices, said in a statement at the time: \u201cCollaborating with the NYSE to launch XBX index options opens a new chapter in digital assets, placing important and familiar risk-management tools in the hands of U.S. and global investors.\u201d\n\nIn July this year Eurex said it is expanding its crypto derivatives portfolio with the launch of FTSE Ethereum index futures and options as of 12 August 2024. The derivatives arm of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group launched FTSE Bitcoin Index futures and options in 2023 and more than 100,000 contracts, equivalent to over $3.5bn in notional, have been traded.\n\nFTSE Russell developed the index with Digital Asset Research. The index captures data from vetted assets and exchanges to meet EU Benchmarks. The final settlement rate of the Eurex contracts is determined as the volume time-weighted average of the FTSE DAR Digital Asset Price over a 15 minute period prior to the fixing time."

        "content": "Over the past ten years, Ethereum has transformed the blockchain landscape.\n\nFrom its initial coin offering to becoming the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum has continuously evolved, implementing major upgrades like the shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Layer 2 scaling solutions and cementing its position as a cornerstone of the Web3 ecosystem despite the emergence of several alternatives over the years.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 10-Year Journey\n\nReflecting on its origins, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) began on July 22, 2014, with the price being 2,000 ETH per sale unit per BTC in a fully permissionless environment devoid of venture capital influence or vesting periods.\n\nThis rate only applied for the first 14 days. After that, the price began to decrease gradually, with each subsequent day offering fewer ETH per unit. By the end of the sale period on September 2, 2014, the rate had dropped to 1337.077 ETH per unit.\n\nFast forward to today, and the value dynamic has shifted dramatically. Now, 1 BTC buys less than 20 ETH. Drake pointed out that few assets have matched Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the past decade, and even fewer have surpassed it by a factor of 100.\n\nEthereum has evolved into a crucial component of the blockchain ecosystem. So far, 4.3 million ETH has been burned for gas fees since the introduction of EIP-1559, and many more are expected to be burned with the introduction of blob transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanism now provides $100 billion in economic security, ten times more than Bitcoin, and supports DeFi and restaking, vastly improving the Internet of Value\u2019s economic bandwidth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Institutional Journey Begins\n\nAll eyes are on the spot Ether ETF, which, according to Drake, further signified Ethereum\u2019s growing recognition as a digital commodity, marking the beginning of the crypto asset\u2019s institutional journey.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) will debut five spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on July 23, pending final regulatory approval, as announced by the agency last week. This follows the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval on May 23, which greenlighted the listing of several spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe five Ethereum ETFs scheduled for launch are the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nTo attract investors and secure a market position, most of the ETH ETF issuers are planning to offer temporary fee reductions or waivers as the funds start trading."

ETHW has a low management fee of 0.20% , with the fee set to 0% for the first six months on the first $500 million in assets.1 The fund invests directly in ether (ETH), the world's second-largest crypto asset2 and the driving force behind the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInvestors should note that, unlike many other exchange-traded products, ETHW is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not subject to its regulations.\n\n\u201cThe World\u2019s Most Interesting Crypto Asset\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe Ethereum is the world's most interesting blockchain, and an exchange-traded product gives investors much-awaited exposure to its potential,\u201d said Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. \u201cInvesting in ETH is like making a 'picks and shovels' investment in the underlying infrastructure behind tokenization, stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, decentralized social media, and other killer apps in the blockchain space. Ethereum is also the platform of choice for big brands like Nike, JPMorgan, and others as they experiment with public blockchains.3 And now, thanks to ETHW, investors can gain exposure to Ethereum's growth potential and diversify their crypto exposure with the ease and familiarity of buying a stock.\u201d\n\nEthereum has become the primary platform for stablecoins and DeFi, whose markets today are around $150 billion each.4 Growing awareness of Ethereum\u2019s potential has driven ETH, the asset that powers it, to a market cap of more than $400 billion\u2014second only to bitcoin among digital assets.5\n\nETHW: Blockchain-Native Features, Managed by Veteran Crypto Asset Manager\n\nETHW features several key characteristics:\n\n10% of gross profits to be donated to Ethereum open-source developers. Bitwise has committed to donating 10% of all ETHW profits to two organizations: Protocol Guild, a grassroots funding organization that supports more than 170 core contributors to Ethereum Layer 1 protocol research and development, and PBS Foundation, a non-profit that funds open-source Ethereum block relays and surrounding research. \u201cEthereum, as an open-source technology, is maintained by a dedicated community of open-source developers,\u201d said Hong Kim, Bitwise\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. \u201cEvery investor in ETHW wants Ethereum to continue to advance, and this donation program contributes to that goal.\u201d\n\nBitwise has committed to donating of all ETHW profits to two organizations: Protocol Guild, a grassroots funding organization that supports more than 170 core contributors to Ethereum Layer 1 protocol research and development, and PBS Foundation, a non-profit that funds open-source Ethereum block relays and surrounding research. \u201cEthereum, as an open-source technology, is maintained by a dedicated community of open-source developers,\u201d said Hong Kim, Bitwise\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. \u201cEvery investor in ETHW wants Ethereum to continue to advance, and this donation program contributes to that goal.\u201d Builds on the historic success of Bitwise\u2019s spot bitcoin ETP.

An investment in ETHW is subject to a high degree of risk, has the potential for significant volatility, and could result in significant or complete loss of investment.\n\nETHW is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) and is not afforded its protections.\n\nShares of ETPs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. The NAV may not always correspond to the market price of ether and, as a result, Creation Units may be created or redeemed at a value that is different from the market price of the Shares. Authorized Participants\u2019 buying and selling activity associated with the creation and redemption of Creation Units may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\n\nETHW will not participate in the proof-of-stake validation mechanism to earn additional ether or seek other means of generating income from its ether holdings.\n\nThe amount of ether represented by a Share will continue to be reduced during the life of the Fund due to the transfer of the Fund\u2019s ether to pay for the Sponsor\u2019s management fee, and to pay for litigation expenses or other extraordinary expenses. This dynamic will occur irrespective of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of ether.\n\nThere is no guarantee or assurance that the Fund\u2019s methodology will result in the Fund achieving positive investment returns or outperforming other investment products.\n\nInvestors may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in ether. An investment in the Fund is not a direct investment in ether. Because the value of the Shares is correlated with the value of the ether held by the Fund, it is important to understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, ether.\n\nEther Risk. There are significant risks and hazards inherent in the ether market that may cause the price of ether to fluctuate widely. The Fund\u2019s ether may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access. Investors considering a purchase of Shares should carefully consider how much of their total assets should be exposed to the ether market, and should fully understand, be willing to assume, and have the financial resources necessary to withstand the risks involved in the Fund\u2019s investment strategy.\n\nLiquidity Risk. The market for ether is still developing and may be subject to periods of illiquidity. During such times it may be difficult or impossible to buy or sell a position at the desired price. Possible illiquid markets may exacerbate losses or increase the variability between the Fund\u2019s NAV and its market price. The lack of active trading markets for the Shares may result in losses on investors\u2019 investments at the time of disposition of Shares.\n\nRegulatory Risk. Future and current regulations by a U.S. or foreign government or quasi-governmental agency could have an adverse effect on an investment in the Fund.\n\nBlockchain Technology Risk. Certain of the Fund\u2019s investments may be subject to the risks associated with investing in blockchain technology. The risks associated with blockchain technology may not fully emerge until the technology is widely used. Blockchain systems could be vulnerable to fraud, particularly if a significant minority of participants colluded to defraud the rest. Because blockchain technology systems may operate across many national boundaries and regulatory jurisdictions, it is possible that blockchain technology may be subject to widespread and inconsistent regulation.\n\nNondiversification Risk. The Fund is nondiversified and will hold a single issue. As a result, a decline in the market value of a particular issue held by the Fund may affect the Fund\u2019s value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers.\n\nRecency Risk.

        "title": "Still no bank custodians amongst nine approved ETH ETFs - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Today\u2019s the day that trading starts in Ether ETFs following the long awaited approval by the SEC yesterday. Eight of the nine ETFs have the cryptocurrency held in custody by Coinbase Custody. The only exception is Fidelity Digital Assets, which is looking after the cryptocurrency that underpins the Fidelity ETF. Hence, there are no bank custodians looking after the cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is despite a reported recent relaxation of rules that previously blocked bank custodians. Either the rule relaxations came too late for these ETFs. Or the ETF issuers decided to stick with the same custodians they used for their Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn theory, the SEC\u2019s accounting rule SAB 121 blocks banks from custody because it forces them to include the cryptocurrency on their balance sheet. Given cryptocurrencies are considered high risk, the banks would have to set aside a lot of capital, making custody too expensive.\n\nSAB 121 is still in force despite the House and Senate voting to cancel it. President Biden vetoed their resolutions and an attempt to overturn his veto failed.\n\nCongresswoman Waters revealed that the SEC was discussing SAB 121 modifications with custody banks. This came to light during House debates about overturning the veto. Later that day, Bloomberg reported that banks had been discussing the issue with the SEC since late 2023 and some had satisfied the SEC with their safeguards. Hence, the SEC had agreed they did not need to include the assets on their balance sheets.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, given custody banks have far higher security budgets than the likes of Coinbase, one would have thought that some of the ETFs might have given the bank custodians a try.\n\nEthereum without staking\n\nMeanwhile, until recently the SEC had treated Ether 2 as if it was a security. It made an about turn in May when it classified it as a commodity, opening the path for yesterday\u2019s approval.\n\nNine ETFs were approved by eight issuers: 21Shares, Bitwise, iShares (BlackRock), Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale (2 ETFs), Invesco Galaxy and VanEck.\n\nSeveral asset managers are offering reduced fees, with Van Eck, Bitwise and Franklin Templeton amongst those offering zero sponsor fees for limited periods.\n\n\u201cAfter the success of our spot bitcoin ETF (EZBC) launch in January, we are proud to add EZET to our growing lineup of digital asset ETFs,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Connor, Head of Global ETFs for Franklin Templeton. \u201cWith EZET, we are thrilled to offer our clients additional access to the digital asset ecosystem within a regulated fund structure that integrates seamlessly into traditional portfolios.\u201d\n\nOne notable difference is that in Europe the popular Ether physical ETPs involve staking. 21Shares Ethereum staking ETP has a market capitalization of $510 million and Coinshares\u2019 equivalent ETP is $293 million. However, Ethereum doesn\u2019t rank in the top five ETPs in Europe. 21Shares Solana staking ETP is number three at $987 million.\n\n\u201cOne of the negatives we have seen in the applications is the dropping of staking,\u201d said Chanchal Samadder, Head of Product at asset manager ETC Group. \u201cWe believe staking is a fundamental positive within our Ethereum ETP, ET32. Ethereum investments generate cash flows via staking rewards and, therefore, could be valued like a tech stock.\u201d"

The spot Ethereum fund aims to provide investors with direct exposure to the second-largest Web3 ecosystem by market capitalisation.\n\nTo support the Ethereum ecosystem, Bitwise has pledged to donate 10% of all ETHW profits to two key organisations: Protocol Guild and PBS Foundation. These entities play crucial roles in supporting Ethereum\u2019s core development and infrastructure.\n\nHong Kim, CTO of Bitwise, said: \u201cEthereum, as an open-source technology, is maintained by a dedicated community of open-source developers. Every investor in ETHW wants Ethereum to continue to advance, and this donation program contributes to that goal.\u201d\n\nThe launch of ETHW comes on the heels of Bitwise\u2019s successful Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which amassed $2.7 billion in assets under management within six months of its debut. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes the introduction of spot Ethereum ETPs will further accelerate crypto investment.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETPs started a new ballgame for crypto; the launch of spot ether ETPs moves us to the second inning,\u201d Hougan stated. \u201cMaking bitcoin available in an exchange-traded format brought more than $17 billion of new investment into crypto in a matter of months. We think this launch will extend that run with billions more and drive ETH to new all-time highs in 2024.\u201d\n\nETHW boasts a competitive management fee of 0.20%, with the fee waived entirely for the first six months on the initial $500 million in assets. This approach aims to attract a wide range of investors seeking exposure to Ethereum\u2019s potential.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley emphasised the significance of this launch for retail investors: \u201cNow with ETHW, millions of Americans can gain exposure to Ethereum through their financial advisor or the traditional brokerage and retirement accounts they rely on for their investing activities.\u201d\n\nThe fund\u2019s structure leverages experienced service providers, including Coinbase Custody Trust Company as digital asset custodian, Bank of New York Mellon as administrator, and KPMG as auditor. In a move towards transparency, Bitwise has committed to publishing the Ethereum addresses of all ETHW holdings, allowing investors to verify the fund\u2019s assets directly on the blockchain.\n\nEthereum\u2019s growing importance in the crypto ecosystem is evident in its adoption by major global brands such as Nike, Starbucks, Tiffany & Co, and JPMorgan. The blockchain has become the primary platform for stablecoins and decentralised finance (DeFi), with markets valued at approximately $150 billion each.\n\nBitwise\u2019s launch of ETHW represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of Ethereum investment products. By combining low fees with a commitment to supporting open-source development, Bitwise aims to attract both individual and institutional investors while contributing to the long-term growth of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nInvestors should note that ETHW, like other crypto-based exchange-traded products, is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (PDF) and does not fall under its regulations. As always, potential investors are advised to conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before participating in cryptocurrency investments.\n\n(Photo by Michael F\u00f6rtsch)\n\nSee also: Sam Altman\u2019s blockchain project \u2018World Chain\u2019 opens to developers\n\nWant to learn more about blockchain from industry leaders?

        "content": "As anticipation for spot Ethereum ETFs grows, a dormant Ethereum ICO wallet has been reactivated after nine years. Whale Alert reports that this wallet, now holding 977 ETH, is worth approximately $3.4 million based on Ethereum\u2019s current price of $3,490.25.\n\nThis wallet did not move during the period when Ethereum was at $1, which means that the holder made a huge profit. The reason behind this sudden activity is still unknown, but it fits into a new pattern where old crypto wallets are being activated.\n\nSource : Whale Alert\n\nEarlier this month, another Ethereum wallet that had been inactive since the ICO period was also activated, containing 6,000 ETH or $21.9 million at a price of $3,642.\n\nWhile some may argue that such activities may be indicative of market exits, the Ethereum ecosystem is still healthy. The key metrics for Ethereum seem favorable, which is attributed to the expected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nETH is trading at $3,400 and the trading volume has increased by more than 50% within the past 24 hours to $18.7 billion. The market capitalization of Ethereum is $419. 4 billion, keeping its place as the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the same way, there are indications that inactive Bitcoin wallets are also coming alive. In the past few days, a Bitcoin wallet that was last active more than 10 years ago came back online and showed that it has 25 BTC which is now worth $1.6 million, from $20,399 in 2013.\n\nAnother wallet from the same period indicates an increase of 10,419%, which proves that Bitcoin was profitable for early investors who did not spend their coins.\n\nThe return of old wallets and the expected launch of spot Ethereum ETFs are stimulating interest in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum demonstrating high performance and turnover."

        "content": "Bitwise Asset Management will provide 10% of the profits from the new Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) to the Ethereum Developers. The ETF, which starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 23, tracks the Ethereum (ETH), the second by market capitalization cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ETF will offer direct exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. To start, ETHW will have a 0.20% management fee, waived for the first six months on the first $500 million of assets.\n\nThe donations will be made annually over the next ten years to organizations such as Protocol Guild and the PBS Foundation. Protocol Guild supports Ethereum\u2019s core developers, while the PBS Foundation funds open-source block relays and related research.\n\nHong Kim, CTO of Bitwise, emphasized the importance of these contributions: \u201cEthereum is an open-source technology supported by a community of developers. Every ETHW investor wants Ethereum to grow, which is why we\u2019re implementing this donation program.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the donation announcement, Bitwise has disclosed that all ETHW holdings will be visible through Ethereum addresses. The launch of ETHW follows the success of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which quickly amassed $2.7 billion in assets under management.\n\nMatt Hougan, Bitwise CIO, noted that Ether ETFs could drive Ethereum to new highs by the end of 2024. He contrasted Bitcoin\u2019s role as a monetary asset with Ethereum\u2019s use in powering decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and stablecoins.\n\nDespite the positive news, Ethereum\u2019s price fell 2.40% to $3,449, with a 2.35% drop in market cap to $414.8 billion, though trading volume surged 36% to $18.6 billion, and analysts forecast a potential rise to $5,000 with the ETF approval.\n\nBitwise\u2019s ETHW ETF is a promising development, giving investors direct Ethereum exposure while contributing to Ethereum\u2019s growth. The introductory fee waiver adds further appeal, enhancing the ETF\u2019s value proposition."

        "content": "Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) debuted to robust investor interest within the first 90 minutes of trading, amassing a total volume of $361 million across the nine newly launched ETFs.\n\nBloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared the initial data on social media and noted that the impressive start ranks these ETFs among the top 1% in overall ETF volume, comparable to well-established funds such as TLT and EEM.\n\nLeading the pack, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE reported the highest volume at $147.8 million, followed by BlackRock\u2019s ETHA with $71.4 million and Bitwise\u2019s ETHW at $50.4 million. Fidelity\u2019s FETH also saw significant activity \u2014 recording $49.3 million in volume.\n\nThe other ETFs that contributed to the remarkable 90-minute total include Grayscale\u2019s ETH with $18.4 million, VanEck\u2019s ETHV with $9.3 million, Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZET with $8.5 million; Invesco\u2019s QETH with $4.0 million and 21Shares\u2019 CETH with $2.0 million.\n\nThese figures highlight the strong demand for Ethereum-based investment vehicles, far surpassing the typical volume for new ETF launches, which often struggle to exceed $1 million on their first day.\n\nAccording to Balchunas:\n\n\u201cAs a group, that number [$361 million] would rank them about 15th overall in ETF volume. Compared to a normal ETF launch, which rarely sees more than $1 million on Day One, all of them have cleared that number and then some.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Balchunas had reported that within the first 15 minutes of trading, Ethereum ETFs had already amassed $112 million in volume. This initial surge, while impressive, was about half the volume pace of Bitcoin ETFs on their first day.\n\nBalchunas noted that Ethereum ETFs are performing at about 20% to 25% of the volume recorded by Bitcoin ETFs when accounting for Grayscale outflow, which still represents a very solid showing and is in line with his previous projections.\n\nThe successful initial trading of these Ethereum ETFs reflects growing investor interest in digital assets and their integration into mainstream financial products. This development is expected to further boost the crypto\u2019s visibility and adoption in traditional markets.\n\nFor now, market watchers will be keen to see if this strong start can be maintained throughout the day and what it signals for the future of crypto ETFs.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto asset manager Grayscale has transferred a hefty sum of Ethereum to Coinbase Prime as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) associated with the asset gear up for a trading debut in the U.S. this week.\n\nGrayscale's transaction of $1.01 billion to Coinbase Prime on Wednesday prompted market participants to suggest Grayscale might be preparing for a sell-off to reinvest in another crypto, such as Solana.\n\nJon Campagna, managing partner at crypto hedge fund Nexyst Digital and formerly associated with Coinfund and Blackrock, dismissed these claims in a Tuesday post on X, saying Grayscale is unlikely to reallocate its Ethereum holdings.\n\nIt comes as Grayscale tipped 10% of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) holdings into its separate Ethereum ETF (ETH) on July 18, Campagna explained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new fund is expected to become active on Wednesday, with ETHE holders receiving their proportional ETF positions.\n\nTo facilitate the move, the asset manager transferred $1 billion, or 10% of their $10 billion AUM in ETHE, to Coinbase Prime, as announced a week earlier by Grayscale, Campagna wrote.\n\n\"What will be interesting is to see the outflows from ETHE as they refuse to lower their ... fee,\" Campagna said. \"My guess is those outflows get recycled into inflows into the lower-cost ETFs, like Grayscale's own 15 basis point fee ETH ticker. Brilliant move by them as they quasi-guarantee more assets stay in-house this way.\"\n\n\"Grayscale is not lowering at all,\" Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a post to X on July 18. \"This means they are ten times higher than competition.\" Grayscale is expected to maintain a 2.5% fee on ETHE.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile algorithmic trading firm Wintermute has indicated that the demand for Ethereum ETFs might be lower than expected, analysts remain optimistic about their debut on Wednesday.\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, has said Ethereum could reach as high as $5,000, Decrypt previously reported.\n\nEthereum has already begun to move higher, surpassing $3,500 on July 17 after a significant drop earlier in the month.\n\nGrayscale is among several major investment firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, preparing to launch Ether ETFs.\n\nDemand for the funds is projected to be between $3.2 billion and $4 billion.\n\nEdited by Sebastian Sinclair"

Discover SCENE\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market eagerly anticipates the launch of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), demand may not be as strong as many analysts have predicted, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.\n\nThe expected introduction of Ethereum ETFs comes six months after the successful introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which amassed an impressive $13.8 billion in their first 100 trading days.\n\nWhile the imminent launch of Ether ETFs on July 23 has generated significant interest, market experts are divided on their potential performance.\n\n\u201cAnalysts hold varying views on Ethereum ETFs, with most estimates putting year-one annualized flows in the $4.8-$6.4 billion range,\" a new report by Wintermute stated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm's own analysis, however, suggests a more conservative outlook.\n\n\"Our view is the ETFs will likely see lower-than-anticipated demand, closer to $3.2 to $4 billion,\" the report states. With a \u201cbaseline expectation\u201d that Ethereum ETFs will see 15% to 20% of the flow observed for Bitcoin ETFs, Wintermute forecasts a price increase of 18% to 24%.\n\nThat is lower than some analysts project, with one recently predicting that the price of ETH will hit $5,000 following the launch of Ethereum ETFs, a 50% increase.\n\nThe report attributes this less optimistic forecast to two key factors. First, \"the absence of a staking mechanism diminishing Ethereum's appeal as an ETF vehicle.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe inability to stake Ethereum within these ETFs could make them less attractive to yield-seeking investors who might otherwise be drawn to the potential returns offered by direct Ethereum holdings, the firm said.\n\nSecondly, the report cites \"the lack of a shared narrative to attract investors\" as a potential hurdle for Ether ETFs.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has successfully tapped into the \"digital gold\" narrative, Ethereum's more complex ecosystem and diverse applications may make it challenging to present a unified investment thesis to potential ETF buyers, Wintermute said\u2014noting that Ethereum's flexibility could still appeal to some.\n\n\u201dWithin the ecosystem, Ether operates not only as a digital currency but also as a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis dual functionality has the potential to attract investors who are keen on technological innovations and the diverse applications of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic ETC/USD is trading up by 2.23% to $24.12 during Tuesday\u2019s session after the SEC approved the first Ethereum spot ETFs, which began trading Tuesday.\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum spot ETFs is a significant event for the cryptocurrency market, primarily benefiting ETH.\n\nInstitutional investors, who are more likely to invest through ETFs, will focus on ETH rather than ETC. This shift in attention and investment could cause a relative decrease in demand for ETC.\n\nSee Also: What\u2019s Going On With Wells Fargo Shares? Analyst Lowers Price Target\n\nInitial reactions might have included speculative buying of ETC due to its association with Ethereum.\n\nHowever, as the market rationalizes, investors may realize that the direct beneficiary of the ETF approval is ETH, not ETC. This realization can lead to a sell-off in ETC as the enthusiasm wanes.\n\nAs retail investors look for cheaper alternatives to ETH, they might initially drive up ETC\u2019s price. However, with the spotlight on ETH due to the ETF, the perceived value proposition of ETC might diminish, causing investors to reallocate funds back to ETH, leading to a drop in ETC's price.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is also highly correlated. If Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a downturn despite the positive ETF news, broader market sentiment could turn negative, affecting ETC as well. Traders might sell ETC in response to overall bearish trends in major cryptocurrencies like ETH and Bitcoin.\n\nNow Read:"

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs debut, signaling significant market expansion and institutional acceptance of digital assets.\n\nAnalysts predict ETH price surge, potentially mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s historic rise and impacting financial services.\n\nIn line with our previous update on Grayscale\u2019s Mini Ethereum ETF receiving SEC approval, trading is imminent, starting July 23. The Cboe exchange will launch five new Spot Ethereum ETFs, marking a notable expansion in cryptocurrency investment options.\n\nAs listed in the Cboe listings, five new ETFs will begin trading on July 23: 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETF), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), and the VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV). Detailed in today\u2019s CNF YouTube video below, these ETFs will follow Ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSince Ether is the second-largest digital asset, these ETFs represent a new milestone for U.S. markets, aligning with the SEC\u2019s recent approvals of similar cryptocurrency products.\n\nWill ETH Price Explode?\n\nThis initiative, partly driven by political dynamics in an election year, indicates growing institutional acceptance of digital assets, despite ongoing debates about investor readiness for such innovative investment tools. Analysts are keenly observing, expecting potentially significant impacts on financial services through decentralized smart contract networks, even suggesting ETH could mirror Bitcoin\u2019s 200% surge as reported in a previous CNF report.\n\nAs of now, according to CoinMarketCap data from today, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $3,498.36, having surged by 4.49% in the past week.

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has issued notices of effectiveness for several Ethereum-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as they begin trading today, July 23.\n\nAvailable information on the regulator\u2019s website confirms the effectiveness of the S-1 filing of different issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Invesco, and Fidelity, among others.\n\nPre-market trading is already open, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) opening at $27.50 before falling slightly to $26.64 as of press time.\n\nOn July 22, reports emerged that the SEC had given its final approval for the spot Ethereum ETFs to begin trading on July 23. Asset management firm Grayscale confirmed that its Ethereum ETF products\u2014the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and Ethereum Trust Fund\u2014would start trading on the New York Stock Exchange today.\n\nThis development ends weeks of waiting for ETF products of the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, which the regulator had extensively investigated and initially suggested was a security.\n\nMarket experts hailed the move, pointing out that the ETFs will provide convenient access, liquidity, and transparency for investors looking to gain exposure to digital assets. Jay Jacobs, BlackRock\u2019s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs, said:\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s appeal lies in its decentralized nature and its potential to drive digital transformation in finance and other industries.\u201d\n\nHow will ETH price react?\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price has been largely muted despite the impending launch of the ETFs, blockchain research firm Kaiko reported that it was unclear how the initial inflows from the products could impact the asset.\n\nWill Cai, head of indices at Kaiko, said:\n\n\u201cThe launch of the futures based ETH ETFs in the US late last year was met with underwhelming demand, all eyes are on the spot ETFs\u2019 launch with high hopes on quick asset accumulation. Although a full demand picture may not emerge for several months, ETH price could be sensitive to inflow numbers of the first days.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitwise\u2019s CIO Matt Hougan predicted that the upcoming spot Ethereum ETFs will propel the digital asset\u2019s price to new all-time highs of more than $5,000. He said:\n\n\u201cBy year-end, I\u2019m confident the new highs will be in. And if flows are stronger than many market commentators expect, the price could be much higher still.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum exchange-traded funds will finally hit U.S. markets tomorrow after the Securities and Exchange Commission said yes to the products in May and signed them off for trading today.\n\nThe Bitcoin equivalent has been a roaring success following its launch in January. The funds\u2014which allow investors to buy shares that track the price of the cryptocurrency\u2014received lots of attention as traditional investors previously spooked by the complex crypto space could finally get exposure to an asset on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nSo will traders repeat the rush and flood the new Ethereum funds with cold, hard cash? Can we look forward to an all-time high price for ETH, as some have predicted?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHold your horses, market experts told Decrypt. Things might take a while to settle out.\n\n\u201cI think the inflows are going to disappoint for the ETH ETFs,\u201d Greg Magadini, derivatives director at blockchain data provider Amberdata, told Decrypt. He pointed to demand for Ethereum futures being \u201clackluster\u201d ahead of the launch.\n\nBefore the Bitcoin ETFs dropped, Magadini said, traders were desperate for exposure to the asset, and the derivatives market\u2014which allowed people to bet on the future price of an asset\u2014was buzzing.\n\nThis is simply not the case this time round. \u201cTherefore the demand for ETH exposure is likely to be underwhelming compared to BTC,\u201d he added.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at Jersey-based asset manager CoinShares, pointed to another potential downside: Grayscale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe top crypto asset manager will launch two products: a main ETF and a mini one. The main one will be a conversion from a fund that operates like a closed-end product to an ETF. ETFs, by their very nature, are easy to cash out of.\n\nIt\u2019s expected, Butterfill told Decrypt, that investors will want to cash out of the main Grayscale ETF as soon as it launches\u2014which is exactly what happened when Grayscale converted its Bitcoin trust into an ETF in January, putting downward pressure on the asset\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely the initial weeks will be marred by outflows from the Grayscale ETH product, in a similar way to the Bitcoin closed-end fund that saw outflows when it became an ETF\u2014investors had been \u2018locked in\u2019 due to the steep discount to net asset value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did add that the approval was positive for the digital asset sector as a whole, and eventually \u201cmay enhance market stability and investor confidence.\u201d\n\nAs for the mini fund, Billy Luedtke, CEO and founder of Ethereum-based authentication protocol Intuition, said that the mini trust could help push the price of ETH up.\n\n\u201cThe [mini trust] offers investors an exchange to the new ETFs without tax liabilities, providing a more attractive fee structure to those who might be skeptical,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cWith reduced barriers to entry, enhanced investor attractiveness through improved fee structures and tax benefits, and increased awareness, substantial inflows into Ethereum can likely be expected.\u201d\n\nFinally, Patrick Felder, Prismatic Capital founder and CIO, told Decrypt that the market is expecting flows of around 15-25% of what we're seeing with the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHe added that if inflows come in stronger than that, \u201cwe\u2019ll see a big move up in ETH price as market expectations reset.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

It caught a bit of a bid, McMillin added. \"Now we need to see sustained demand. That is the real test.\u201d"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA question looming over Tuesday\u2019s launch of spot Ethereum ETFs is whether any outflows from a flagship fund at Grayscale could dull investors\u2019 initial excitement.\n\nWhen spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shed more than $2 billion in its first five trading days, as investors took profits or flocked to funds from financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. Initially, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell amid a Wall Street debut, somewhat stifling the buzz around their long-awaited launch.\n\nBoasting over $9 billion in assets under management, the management fee for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has remained steady at 2.5%. Meanwhile, competitors have positioned their products as cheaper alternatives with post-waiver fees ranging between 0.19% and 0.25%.\n\nWith its parallel launch of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), however, the asset manager has come prepared. In the lead-up to Tuesday\u2019s launch, the spinoff fund\u2019s management fee was slashed to 0.15%\u2014an industry-wide low among the firms jockeying for inflows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe purpose of that exercise with the Mini Trust is to keep funds within Grayscale funds,\u201d Andrew O\u2019Neill, Managing Director for Digital Assets at S&P Global Ratings, told Decrypt. He described it as a \u201clower-cost option\u201d for investors.\n\nGreg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, described Garyscale\u2019s Mini Trust as a \u201cstrategic move\u201d in a recent research note, arguing that \u201cGrayscale is now positioned to compete for inflows\u201d after a similar, low-cost alternative was lacking for GBTC in January.\n\nGrayscale plans to launch a mini-sized alternative for GBTC too, which will have an industry-low management fee of 0.15% too. The product is set to launch next week on July 31, according to Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart.\n\nBillions in cash could eventually be directed at Ethereum long-term as a result of spot ETFs, but William Cai, Head of Indices at the research firm Kaiko, told Decrypt that initial outflows from ETHE should be expected as \u201carbitrageurs [...] redeem and close their trades.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor years, ETHE\u2019s shares traded at a discount relative to the amount of Ethereum the product holds because of its structure as a closed-end fund. Given the instant disappearance of that discount in May as spot ETFs were approved, Cai said, \u201cThere very likely will be fund outflows.\u201d\n\nGrayscale seeded its Mini Trust with $1 billion worth of Ethereum from its legacy product, representing 10% of ETHE\u2019s underlying assets. At the same time, ETHE\u2019s investors gained a corresponding amount of shares in the Mini Trust, which were distributed in a way that \u201cis not expected to be a taxable event,\u201d according to a press release from the asset manager.\n\nStill, the prospect of taxes levied on would-be sellers of ETHE could be a key factor. A company executive from an asset manager, who declined to be named while speaking about a competitor, told Decrypt that a steep tax bill could prevent existing ETHE investors from exiting.\n\n\u201cUnless you have a massive capital gain and want to avoid paying taxes, you\u2019re going to rotate to a lower-fee product,\u201d they said. \u201cThe question is whether they will rotate to [Grayscale\u2019s Mini Trust] or a competitor\u2019s fund. I imagine you\u2019ll see both.\u201d\n\nWhile an initial glimpse at the performance of spot Ethereum ETFs won\u2019t be posted until U.S. markets close, Ethereum\u2019s price fell as Tuesday trading progressed. As of this writing, Ethereum\u2019s price had fallen 0.5% over the past day to $3,450, though Bitcoin's price has fallen more than 2% by comparison.\n\nWhile any outflows could weigh on investors\u2019 hopes within the coming days, Grayscale\u2019s Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt that the bigger picture is similarly important.\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research expects that spot Ethereum ETPs will see significant net inflows over the coming months,\u201d he said, adding that in light of Tuesday\u2019s launches, \u201cinvestors may be under-appreciating the importance of this milestone.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "VanEck Launches ETHV: Ethereum ETF Providing Spot Ether Exposure - Business Wire",
        "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VanEck is today launching the VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), which provides spot ether exposure through an exchange-traded product. ETHV trades on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Sponsor fees will be waived through 7/22/2025 or the first $1.5B in AUM. After that, the sponsor fee will be 0.20%.\n\n\u201cInvesting in Ethereum presents an opportunity for pure play exposure to the economics of blockchain software, and we\u2019re pleased to be able to deliver in the U.S.,\u201d said Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck. \u201cWe look forward to engaging with clients about the role ether can play in a diversified portfolio, particularly as an aggressive growth investment.\u201d\n\nVanEck has long been an advocate and vocal leader bringing direct digital assets exposure to the exchange-traded product space. VanEck took the lead in filing for an exchange-traded spot ether product in 2021, and previously was the first established ETF issuer to file for a futures-based bitcoin ETF in 2017, followed by a filing for a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund in 2018. At the start of this year, the firm launched the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), which provides spot bitcoin exposure.\n\nVanEck\u2019s efforts around digital assets, like in many of the categories where the firm has been an established leader, have been global in focus. The firm\u2019s European arm currently manages 12 crypto exchange-traded products, while its MarketVector index subsidiary was the first regulated index provider to launch a suite of digital asset indexes featuring its flagship Bitcoin & Ethereum Benchmark Rates. A timeline of VanEck\u2019s industry-leading efforts in digital asset thought leadership and product development can be found here.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting day not just for our team, but for investors more broadly,\u201d added Kyle DaCruz, Director, Digital Assets Product at VanEck. \u201cETHV opens the door for investors who may have been curious about the role ether can play in their portfolio, but who might have been precluded from accessing it for a variety of reasons. It\u2019s important to note that ether and bitcoin are very different assets, providing very different types of exposure. While we\u2019re excited to be introducing ETHV, we\u2019re just as excited to be at the forefront of educating all types of investors as to just what ether is and what makes it unique.\u201d\n\nETHV joins growing suite of VanEck digital assets offerings\n\nETHV joins HODL in a VanEck digital assets fund family that also includes the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP), which focuses on those companies driving the growth of the digital assets economy. The firm also oversees several digital assets-focused private vehicles for institutions and accredited investors, and was the first established global asset manager to market in Europe with a range of digital assets ETPs, bringing the firm\u2019s total assets in crypto-linked products to approximately $2B globally.\n\nVanEck\u2019s X feed, @vaneck_us, is a go-to source for updates on the firm\u2019s digital asset efforts and much more. The firm\u2019s digital assets research team, led by Matthew Sigel, regularly publishes deeply researched commentary, insights and predictions for the space, which can be accessed here.\n\nAbout VanEck\n\nVanEck has a history of looking beyond the financial markets to identify trends that are likely to create impactful investment opportunities. We were one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international markets. This set the tone for the firm\u2019s drive to identify asset classes and trends \u2013 including gold investing in 1968, emerging markets in 1993, and exchange traded funds in 2006 \u2013 that subsequently shaped the investment management industry.\n\nToday, VanEck offers active and passive strategies with compelling exposures supported by well-designed investment processes. As of June 30, 2024, VanEck managed approximately $107.7 billion in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs and institutional accounts. The firm\u2019s capabilities range from core investment opportunities to more specialized exposures to enhance portfolio diversification. Our actively managed strategies are fueled by in-depth, bottom-up research and security selection from portfolio managers with direct experience in the sectors and regions in which they invest. Investability, liquidity, diversity, and transparency are key to the experienced decision-making around market and index selection underlying VanEck\u2019s passive strategies.\n\nSince our founding in 1955, putting our clients\u2019 interests first, in all market environments, has been at the heart of the firm\u2019s mission.\n\nGeneral Disclosures\n\nThis is not an offer to buy or sell, or a recommendation to buy or sell any of the securities, financial instruments or digital assets mentioned herein. The information presented does not involve the rendering of personalized investment, financial, legal, tax advice, or any call to action.

An investment in the VanEck Ethereum ETF (\u201cETHV\u201d) or the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (\u201cHODL\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cTrusts\u201d) may not be suitable for all investors. Before investing you should carefully consider the Trusts\u2019 investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.\n\nInvesting involves significant risk, and you could lose money on an investment in the Trusts. The values of ether and bitcoin are highly volatile, and the value of the Trusts\u2019 shares could decline rapidly, including to zero. You could lose your entire principal investment. For a more complete discussion of the risk factors relative to the Trusts, carefully read the prospectuses.\n\nThe Trusts\u2019 investment objectives are to reflect the performance of the price of ether (in the case of ETHV) or bitcoin (in the case of HODL) less the expenses of each Trust\u2019s operations. The Trusts are passive investment vehicles that do not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of ether or bitcoin.\n\nThe Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\u201c1940 Act\u201d) or commodity pools for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d). Shares of the Trusts are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds. As a result, shareholders of the Trusts do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.\n\nAn investment in either of the Trusts is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, the historically and potentially future extreme volatility of ether and bitcoin, various potential factors that may adversely affect the liquidity of the Trusts\u2019 shares, the limited history of the indices from which the value of ether or bitcoin and hence the value of Trusts\u2019 shares will be determined, potential threats to the Trusts\u2019 respective custodians, and the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of ether and bitcoin trading platforms, all of which may ultimately adversely affect the value of shares of the Trusts. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of risks pertaining to the Trusts. Please read carefully the prospectuses for a complete list of potential risks.\n\nBecause shares of the Trusts are intended to reflect the price of the digital assets held in the Trusts, the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting digital asset prices. Additionally, shares of the Trusts are bought and sold at market price, not at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\n\nThe Trusts\u2019 shares trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk and will fluctuate in market value. The value of the Trusts\u2019 shares relate directly to the value of the digital assets held by the Trusts (less their expenses), and fluctuations in the price of the digital assets could materially and adversely affect an investment in the Trusts\u2019 shares. The price received upon the sale of the shares, which trade at market price, may be more or less than the value of the digital assets represented by them. The Trusts do not generate any income, and as the Trusts regularly issue shares to pay for the Sponsor\u2019s ongoing expenses, the amount of digital assets represented by each Share will decline over time.\n\nThis content is published in the United States for residents of specified countries. Investors are subject to securities and tax regulations within their applicable jurisdictions that are not addressed on this content. Nothing in this content should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any investment in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction, nor is it intended as investment, tax, financial, or legal advice.

The Marketing Agent for the Trusts is Van Eck Securities Corporation. VanEck Digital Assets, LLC., and Van Eck Securities Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of Van Eck Associates Corporation.\n\n\u00a9 Van Eck Associates Corporation, 666 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017\n\nPhone: 800.826.2333\n\nEmail: info@vaneck.com\n\nImportant Disclosures \u2013 VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (\u201cDAPP\u201d)\n\nThe VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (\u201cDAPP\u201d) does not invest in digital assets directly or indirectly through derivatives.\n\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks, which is part of a new and rapidly changing industry, is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, the slowing, stopping or reversing of the development or acceptance of the digital asset networks may adversely affect the price of digital assets and therefore cause the Funds to suffer losses, regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in digital assets or restrict the use of digital assets or the operations of the digital asset networks or venues on which digital assets trade in a manner that adversely affects the price of digital assets. Digital assets generally operate without central authority (such as a bank) and are not backed by any government, digital assets are not legal tender and federal, state and/or foreign governments may restrict the use and exchange of digital assets, and regulation in the United States is still developing.\n\nAn investment in the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP) may be subject to risks which include, among others, risks related to investing in digital transformation companies, special risk considerations of investing in European issuers, equity securities, small- and medium-capitalization companies, information technology sector, financials sector, foreign securities, emerging market issuers, market, operational, index tracking, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, passive management, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, non-diversified and industry concentration risks, all of which may adversely affect the Fund. Emerging market issuers and foreign securities may be subject to securities markets, political and economic, investment and repatriation restrictions, different rules and regulations, less publicly available financial information, foreign currency and exchange rates, operational and settlement, and corporate and securities laws risks. Small- and medium-capitalization companies may be subject to elevated risks.\n\nInvesting involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing.

        "title": "Industry group releases Ethereum DeFi handbook - DLNews",
        "content": "A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on July 23. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Aleks here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nWhy EigenLayer is losing steam.\n\nOne Ethereum group is trying to get ahead of DeFi regulations.\n\nA wrinkle in the $125 million Multichain mystery.\n\nEigenLayer cools off\n\nEigenLayer started the year on a tear.\n\nThe protocol that pioneered \u201crestaking\u201d launched in June 2023. But after folks like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned it could destabilise Ethereum, EigenLayer capped its own growth at the outset, limiting how much crypto users could deposit.\n\nEarly this year, it lifted those caps.\n\nWithin a month, it became the second-largest protocol on Ethereum. As of February 1, EigenLayer users had deposited a little more than $2 billion in crypto.\n\nBy March 1, that figure was just under $10 billion.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nVenture capitalists got in on the action. Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million. Affiliated \u201cliquid restaking\u201d projects raised millions, too.\n\nAt the time, I wondered: How much of EigenLayer\u2019s value came from users who really believed the protocol was a \u201cgroundbreaking evolution\u201d and how much came from the \u201cairdrop farmers\u201d using it as their latest cash cow?\n\nWe\u2019re getting our answer now.\n\nThe total value of crypto in EigenLayer peaked in June at $20 billion. It\u2019s since fallen to just under $16 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s because airdrop farmers are leaving, according to one analyst. Now that restaking airdrops have come and gone, investors seek greener pastures.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t all bad.\n\n\u201cRestaking will continue to be a massive market, and an important influence on the overall Ethereum network,\u201d the analyst, Ian Unsworth of Kairos Research, told me.\n\nA DeFi handbook?\n\nWhile politicians and regulators pass laws that cover stablecoins, centralised exchanges, and crypto-based exchange-traded funds, they\u2019ve largely steered clear of DeFi.\n\nMake no mistake, though: Those regulations will come. And one project is trying to get ahead of the next regulatory onslaught.\n\nThe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an industry group, has released its DeFi Risk Assessment Guidelines, an in-depth handbook detailing the risks involved in working with DeFi and how to assess, manage, account for, and mitigate them.\n\nThe guidelines will enable DeFi protocols to take a proactive approach to compliance, while also helping regulators draft regulation that doesn\u2019t stifle innovation.\n\nRegulators in the United Arab Emirates and the European Union are already using the EEA\u2019s guidelines, according to Dyma Budorin, co-chair of the EEA\u2019s DRAMA working group and CEO of blockchain security firm Hacken.\n\nBudorin said the handbook will be useful to traditional financial institutions that are considering jumping into DeFi.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what DeFi risks are, and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t step into DeFi,\u201d he told us. \u201cDeFi protocols that plan to cooperate with old money can use the DeFi Risk Assessment Guidelines as best practice references.\u201d\n\nMultichain hack\n\nWhen crypto bridge Multichain shuttered last summer, citing pressure from Chinese police and an apparent $125 million hack, Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong dismissed speculation that it was an inside job.\n\nHe isn\u2019t so sure anymore.\n\nKong, whose firm lost money in the hack, tells me he can\u2019t rule out that someone affiliated with Multichain made off with the loot.\n\nThe Fantom Foundation has made a similar accusation in a Singapore court.\n\n\u201cI was a little bit too trusting of what Multichain was saying to us,\u201d Kong said.\n\nThe Fantom Foundation was able to confirm that Multichain CEO Zhaojun He was arrested and is awaiting charges.\n\nIt was also able to confirm that other employees were arrested, though they were eventually released.\n\nWhile none of the information is conclusive, certain facts have fanned suspicion that last summer\u2019s event wasn\u2019t a garden-variety hack.\n\nFirst of all, the movement of the stolen crypto post-hack was highly unusual.\n\nSecond, Multichain briefly reopened in November, allowing someone to make a complicated, lightning quick arbitrage trade for $1 million.\n\n\u201cWe believe it to be someone (or some individuals) from Multichain\u2019s former team,\u201d Kong said.\n\nA Multichain representative could not be reached for comment. The company has not defended itself at any stage in Fantom\u2019s lawsuit in Singapore, which began in 2023.\n\nAnd a person familiar with the inner workings of Multichain told DL News the company\u2019s team didn\u2019t plan an inside job.\n\n\u201cThe truth will be known when the police make the case public,\u201d said the person, who requested anonymity out of concern for their family in China.\n\nData of the week\n\nKeep an eye on political memecoins, which have been fluctuating wildly amid the political chaos in the US.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDoland Tremp, a memecoin based on Republican candidate Donald Trump, soared 30% to about 55 cents.\n\nJeo Boden, a play on the president\u2019s name, plunged 59% to about one cent.\n\nA token dubbed Kamala Horris (chart below) skyrocketed 131%.\n\nKamala memecoin jumps on Biden withdrawal. A memecoin inspired by Vice President Kamala Harris jumped after President Joe Biden said he would not seek reelection.

Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has just launched its own crypto passport, which it\u2019s calling an \u201cBinance Account Bound Token.\u201d\n\nBut will it really satisfy lawmakers and regulators?\n\nGot a tip about DeFi?

        "title": "Wintermute: Ethereum ETFs May Face Lower Than Anticipated Demand, ETH Could Gain 24% - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Wintermute: Ethereum ETFs May Face Lower Than Anticipated Demand, ETH Could Gain 24%\n\nAs the Ethereum (ETH) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is officially approved by the SEC and set to launch on July 23, Algorithmic trading firm Wintermute believes demand may not live up to the high expectations set by many analysts\n\nWintermute's latest report offers a more conservative outlook on Ethereum ETFs. \"Analysts hold varying views on Ethereum ETFs, with most estimates putting year-one annualized flows in the $4.8-$6.4 billion range,\" the report states. However, Wintermute forecasts lower-than-anticipated demand, predicting flows closer to $3.2 to $4 billion. The firm expects Ethereum ETFs to capture only 15% to 20% of the flow observed for Bitcoin ETFs and forecasts a price increase of 18% to 24%.\n\nThis projection is significantly lower than some more optimistic forecasts, such as one analyst's prediction that ETH could hit $5,000 following the ETF launch, representing a 50% increase. As of now, Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,475.66.\n\nWintermute attributes its cautious outlook to two main factors. First is the absence of a staking mechanism within the ETFs, which could diminish their appeal to yield-seeking investors. Staking allows users to delegate Ethereum tokens to the network in exchange for rewards. The inability to stake within these ETFs might make them less attractive compared to direct Ethereum holdings.\n\nSecondly, Wintermute points to the lack of a cohesive narrative to attract investors. Unlike Bitcoin, which has successfully promoted itself as \"digital gold,\" Ethereum's more complex ecosystem and diverse applications could make it challenging to present a unified investment thesis. However, the report notes that Ethereum's dual functionality, as both a digital currency and a platform for decentralized applications, could still appeal to investors interested in technological innovations and the varied applications of blockchain technology."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Officially Begin Trading in the US - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "After weeks of speculation, Spot Ethereum ETFs are officially set to begin trading today. The launch signifies only the second crypto-based ETF in the United States after Bitcoin\u2019s debuted in January of this year. With BTC marking a massive moment in the sector\u2019s history, many are hopeful that Ethereum can mirror its success.\n\nThe arrival looked like it was in doubt just three months ago, with things changing rapidly. The US Securities and Exchange Commission allowed S-1 filings to become official on Monday, which was the final green light for the products to go live today. The impending arrival has already seen ETH surpass the $3,500 mark, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nJUST IN: Spot Ethereum ETF trading officially live. July 23, 2024\n\nAlso Read: SEC Officially Approves Spot Ethereum ETF Trading for Tomorrow\n\nEthereum ETF Trading is Officially Live\n\nIn a post to X (formerly Twitter), Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong discussed what is a monumental day for crypto. As the Ethereum ETF began trading, Armstrong called the launch, \u201canother huge step for regulatory clarity,\u201d in the US. Specifically, it\u2019s confirmation that ETH is not a security.\n\nAmid that ongoing debate, eight issuers are set to launch Spot Ether ETFs on Tuesday. Specifically, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, Fidelity, iShare, and Invesco. Among those, Grayscale is set to launch both an Ethereum Mini Trust, and an ETH Trust.\n\nAlso Read:Bitcoin: Can Ethereum ETF Arrival Spur BTC to $70,000?\n\nSix of those launching funds will feature cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as the custodian. However, both VanEck and Fidelity have taken a different approach. The former is using Gemini, while Fidelity has opted for self-custody.\n\nNow, all eyes are on how the investment product will perform. Earlier this month, Kraken executive Thomas Perfumo told Bloomberg the ETF is a \u201crising tide that will lift all boats.\u201d Yet, it is unlikely to reach the heights of Bitcoin. The token reached an all-time high mark of $73,000 just three months after the product launched."

        "title": "The spot ETF on Ethereum obtain final approval from the SEC - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Today, the SEC marks another important milestone with the final approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nThe registration statements will become effective on Monday, allowing the companies in the running to finally launch their Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) products. This news comes in a context of growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, although some analysts predict lower demand compared to the spot bitcoin ETFs, approved earlier this year.\n\nThe approval process of the SEC for Ethereum Spot ETFs\n\nAn ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument that tracks the price of an underlying asset and can be traded on the stock exchange like a share. A spot ETF on Ethereum, specifically, invests directly in Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThis type of ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to buy, hold, and manage the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nThe path towards the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum has followed a rigorous process, similar to that already seen for ETFs on bitcoin. The interested companies had to submit detailed registration statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory body of financial markets in the United States.\n\nThese statements include crucial information about custody structures, investor protection mechanisms, and security measures adopted to prevent fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe news of the final approval was met with enthusiasm by the cryptocurrency community and institutional investors, marking another step towards the mainstream adoption of digital assets. However, not everyone shares the same level of optimism regarding the demand that spot ETFs on Ethereum might generate.\n\nThe demand expectations\n\nThe approval of spot ETFs on bitcoin at the beginning of the year had a significant impact on the market, attracting billions of dollars in new investments. This success was largely attributed to the popularity and notoriety of bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d. In contrast, some analysts predict that spot ETFs on Ethereum might encounter lower demand.\n\nThere are several reasons behind these expectations. Firstly, while Ethereum is certainly a cryptocurrency of great relevance, its main use is as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApp), rather than as a store of value. This could limit the interest of investors looking for an alternative asset to bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the recent volatility of the cryptocurrency market has led to greater caution among investors. Despite this, Ethereum continues to demonstrate its resilience and its capacity for innovation, as evidenced by the recent technical evolutions and the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe introduction of spot ETFs on Ethereum still represents an important opportunity to diversify investment portfolios. It offers an accessible and regulated option for those who wish to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency management.\n\nFurthermore, the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum could encourage further favorable regulatory developments, paving the way for new financial products based on other cryptocurrencies and digital resources.\n\nThis could potentially attract an even greater number of institutional investors, increasing the liquidity and stability of the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe final approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum marks a crucial moment in the history of cryptocurrencies. Despite predictions of lower demand compared to bitcoin ETFs, this innovation offers investors a new tool to access one of the most innovative and dynamic digital assets.\n\nWith the entry into force of the registration statements on Monday, the market is preparing to welcome with interest and attention this new investment opportunity."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs set to launch on Tuesday as the SEC declares issuers' prospectus effective.\n\nBitcoin Conference coinciding with ETH ETFs launch week could help drive a rally for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum traders display uncertainty despite bullish predictions surrounding ETH ETFs' launch.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down nearly 1% on Monday as the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed via its website on Tuesday that it has given the final approval for spot ETH ETFs. Considering the ETH ETF launch and the upcoming Bitcoin Conference, this week could prove crucial for Ethereum.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin Conference, ETH inflows\n\nEthereum may be set for an explosive week ahead with several potential bullish catalysts on the horizon:\n\nAccording to SEC updates on its website, it has approved the S-1 registratements of spot ETH ETF issuers.\n\n\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\n\n\nThe Exchange NYSE Arca confirmed that it has approval to list and begin trading Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF on Tuesday. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) had earlier revealed that Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Franklin Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF will also begin trading on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin 2024 Conference will kick off on July 25, and with Republican nominee Donald Trump set to discuss a potential US Bitcoin strategy during the conference, Bitcoin is expected to see a brief rally. Many expect ETH to largely benefit from the rise due to its positive correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launching in the same week.\n\n\n\nTraditional investors seem to be bullish on ETH ETFs' launch as Ethereum investment products recorded $45 million in inflows last week, according to CoinShares data. The move brought its year-to-date net flows to $103 million.\n\n\n\nSeveral experts including analysts from Bitwise and Galaxy have predicted that ETH ETFs will see inflows of about $3 billion to $5 billion within the first six months of launch.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum traders are uncertain despite upcoming Tuesday ETH ETF launch\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,460 on Monday, down about 1% on the day. In the past 24 hours, ETH has seen $39.87 million in liquidations, with long and short liquidations accounting for 76% and 24%, respectively.\n\nEthereum is expected to see increased volatility this week following Tuesday's potential launch of ETH ETFs. This is evident in ETH options' implied volatility, which jumped from 56% to 70% last week, according to data from Deribit.\n\nIn addition, ETH options with a notional value of $1.89 billion will expire on Friday. The strike price of these options is heavily concentrated around $3,700, with a Put/Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.45. Since the PCR favors calls, it signifies that most traders are bullish, betting on the price of ETH to rise above $3,700 before the month ends.\n\nEnd-of-month options expiry has triggered a significant decrease in ETH options open interest in the past two months. If a similar move occurs this time around, it may signify uncertainty among ETH investors. ETH futures open interest declining slightly by 1% in the past 24 hours also aligns with the uncertainty among options traders.\n\nAnother key metric to watch is the ETH futures Long/Short Ratio, which is at 0.88. This indicates that a larger portion of ETH futures traders are bearish.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nWith uncertainty brewing in the market despite the confirmation of ETH ETFs' launch, the bullish sentiment from inflows may not be able to trigger a massive rally this week, as many predict. On the upside, ETH could rise by 8% to the $3,731 key level while finding support around $3,205 on the downside."
