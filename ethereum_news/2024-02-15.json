        "title": "Attacking Ethereum Costs More Than an Attack on Bitcoin: CoinMetrics - Unchained",
        "content": "The cost to attack Bitcoin ranges from $5 billion to $20 billion, while it would cost over $34 billion to attack Ethereum, according to CoinMetrics. Even then, researchers found no way for the attacker to profit and the network would still survive.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could now be resilient to 51% attacks,\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could now be resilient to 51% attacks, according to new research from on-chain analytics firm CoinMetrics.\n\nA 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners or malicious actors that control more than half the network\u2019s mining hash rate in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) environment or nodes in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) setting, putting them in control over the network.\n\nOf course, the bigger the network is, the harder it becomes to control the majority of hashing power, and now it appears it might be too difficult to execute an attack on the two largest blockchains \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nResearchers quantified the Total Cost to Attack (TCA) of these blockchains and found that it\u2019s more expensive to carry out a malicious act like this than to participate in the network honestly.\n\nLucas Nuzzi, CoinMetrics\u2019 head of research and development, shared excerpts from the academic paper\u2019s findings on X. By the researchers\u2019 estimates, in order to attack Bitcoin, someone would have to buy 7 million ASIC miners \u2013 the cost of which would likely be higher than $20 billion, based on how the market would react to a relentless buyer.\n\n4/ But these ASICs are not for sale! How do you buy 51% of them? One way to do that is to simulate using historical ASIC market data (thanks to https://t.co/C4YC0XjzxI) to see how that market would react to a relentless ASIC buyer In one scenario, that cost alone is close to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fnS6DrLSY8 \u2014 Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) February 15, 2024\n\nEven if a nation-state attacker had the financial resources to manufacture their own ASICs for the attack, the only model that could be reverse engineered would be the Bitmain AntMiner S9, which also has a manufacturing cost of over $20 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the researchers estimate that the total cost to attack Ethereum would be more than $34 billion, with an ETH price of $2,279 (the current price of ETH is $2,830), the total amount of ETH staked at 28.8 million, and a validator count of 899,840. This would also take more than six months due to the churn limit preventing stake from being deployed all at once\n\nOne major concern that industry watchers have raised over the years is the potential threat from Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) provided by staking services like Lido and RocketPool. Lido, in particular, controls 31% of staked ETH, close to Ethereum\u2019s economic security threshold of 33%, meaning that network finality could be disrupted if these nodes colluded.\n\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, an attacker could not leverage LSDs to buy access to block templates,\u201d said Nuzzi.\n\n9 We also find no ways for a nation-state attacker to continuously run a 51% / 34% attack if the goal is to destroy these networks. The possibility of retaliation techniques makes ideologically driven attacks costly at each retaliation round. In the end, the network survives. \u2014 Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) February 15, 2024\n\nUpdated on Feb. 16, 2024, at 6:34 am EST: A previous version of the article misstated the cost to attack Ethereum as $34 million rather than $34 billion. Unchained regrets the error.\n\nUpdated on Feb. 16, 2024, at 7:30 am EST: Change the title from \u201c51% Attacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum Impossible: CoinMetrics\u201d to \u201cAttacking Ethereum Costs More Than an Attack on Bitcoin: CoinMetrics\u201d"

        "content": "NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of digital asset that is unique and indivisible, meaning another asset of equal value cannot replace it. Ethereum and NFTs are often associated with each other, as they are typically created, traded, and stored on the Ethereum network. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities allow for the creation of unique tokens, which can be used to represent digital assets such as art, music, videos, and other types of creative works. These tokens are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a secure and transparent way to verify digital asset ownership and transfer.\n\nIn addition to providing a platform for creating and trading NFTs, Ethereum also provides a way to establish royalties and other payment structures for the use of digital assets. This allows creators to benefit from their digital works\u2019 ongoing use and value. Overall, the relationship between NFTs and Ethereum is symbiotic, as the Ethereum blockchain provides a powerful platform for creating, trading, and establishing value for these unique digital assets. As NFTs continue to gain popularity and use cases, it is likely that Ethereum will remain a key player in this emerging space."

        "title": "How the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Will Affect Ethereum\u2019s Market - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is on the edge of its seat as the next Bitcoin halving event approaches in 2024, an event that promises to reshape the landscape for Bitcoin and its peer cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Are you looking to know about the effect of the upcoming Bitcoin halving on Ethereum?\n\nIn this blog, we will look at the effect of Bitcoin halving on Ethereum, its effect on investor sentiment, market liquidity, and the interplay between supply and demand.\n\nImpact of past Bitcoin halvings on Ethereum prices\n\nThe effects of Bitcoin\u2019s second and third halving events on Ethereum\u2019s prices, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market, offer insights into the intricate dynamics between leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nEffect of Ethereum prices after the second Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 9, 2016, and was characterized by a significant reduction in the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. This event had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency market at large, including Ethereum.\n\nThe price of one ETH went from $14 before the BTC halving to $11 at the time of halving. Experts noted that the price of Ethereum kept plummeting up to 25% until the halving occurred in July 2016. Post-halving, the price of ETH displayed some signs of recovery.\n\nAt the end of three months following the halving, the price of ETH was only 1.8% higher, signifying a stunted recovery.\n\nLet us understand the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s staking supply, which recently crossed 25%, providing key insights into its resilience and potential for growth.\n\nEffect of Ethereum prices following the third Bitcoin halving\n\nThe third Bitcoin halving took place on May 11, 2020, further reducing the block reward to 6.25 BTC. This event preceded a dramatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. The anticipation and aftermath of the halving contributed to a bull market in cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe price of one ETH, before halving, stood at $160. However, after the halving process, the price of ETH experienced a significant spike, with prices immediately reaching up to $211. After a month following the Ethereum halving, the price of ETH soared even further to a staggering $249.\n\nWithin three months of halving, ETH went up by a whopping 88.6%, priced at $398, as compared to the time of halving.\n\nHow will the upcoming Bitcoin halving affect Ethereum in 2024?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 is anticipated to significantly influence Ethereum prices through various interconnected mechanisms and market dynamics. Here\u2019s a detailed exploration of the points mentioned:\n\n1. Historical performance and market dynamics\n\nEthereum\u2019s price dynamics in relation to past Bitcoin halving events offer valuable insights. This pattern suggests that Ethereum could similarly benefit from the 2024 Bitcoin halving.\n\nSuch trends highlight Ethereum\u2019s growing integration and responsiveness to Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles, suggesting potential bullish momentum for Ethereum in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2024 Bitcoin halving.\n\n2. Deflationary mechanisms\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s transition to a deflationary model, particularly through mechanisms like the Ethereum triple halving, plays a crucial role in its value dynamics.\n\nThis triple halving encompasses reduced ETH issuance, the burning of ETH via EIP-1559, and staking rewards, all of which contribute to reducing the circulating supply of ETH. This deflationary pressure is likely to enhance Ethereum\u2019s appeal as an investment, especially in the context of the crypto market\u2019s cyclical booms typically triggered by Bitcoin halving events.\n\nSuch mechanisms ensure that Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics are increasingly favorable, making it a compelling investment in the broader narrative of digital scarcity and value appreciation post-Bitcoin halving.\n\nReflect on the aftermath of the last Bitcoin halving by exploring these five essential insights, offering valuable lessons for Ethereum investors anticipating the next halving event.\n\n3. Investor sentiment and strategic investment\n\nThe anticipation surrounding Bitcoin halvings often generates significant market interest, potentially leading to increased investment in Ethereum as part of broader cryptocurrency market gains.\n\nInvestment strategies like diversification and Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) become particularly relevant as investors look to mitigate the volatility associated with halving events while capitalizing on potential market upswings.\n\nThis strategic shift in investment behavior could see more capital flowing into Ethereum, buoyed by its solid fundamentals and the speculative interest generated by the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAmid speculation about Ethereum\u2019s future, explore all potential bearish scenarios for Ethereum, providing a balanced view of its prospects as the Bitcoin halving approaches.\n\n4. Technological innovation\n\nThe halving event underscores Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and the technological resilience of blockchain networks, setting a backdrop that encourages innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s foundational role in decentralized applications (dAFpps) and its ongoing development initiatives position it favorably for continued growth and adoption.\n\nThe broader context of technological innovation and scarcity, highlighted by Bitcoin\u2019s halving, reinforces Ethereum\u2019s value proposition, potentially driving its price up as the market anticipates increased adoption and use-case expansion.\n\n5. Regulatory landscape and security measures\n\nThe evolving regulatory framework and advancements in security protocols across the cryptocurrency sector are pivotal to Ethereum\u2019s investment outlook. As the industry seeks regulatory clarity and enhanced security measures, the overall appeal of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, is likely to increase.\n\nThis is particularly relevant in the period surrounding the Bitcoin halving, where market optimism and the influx of institutional and retail investment can be significantly influenced by perceptions of regulatory stability and security.\n\nGemini\u2019s report highlights the potential impact of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals on the market, suggesting that similar regulatory milestones could positively affect Ethereum by enhancing its legitimacy and accessibility to a broader investor base.\n\nEthereum price prediction following the 2024 Bitcoin halving\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $2800.29. As we look toward the future of Ethereum, our projections predict that by the end of 2024, Ethereum is expected to reach approximately $3200, marking a significant upturn from its current valuation.\n\nWhile this forecast positions Ethereum\u2019s price notably below its peak historical high, it signals robust confidence in the asset\u2019s growth potential and resilience within the volatile crypto market.\n\nThis anticipated rise reflects the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, driven by continuous innovation and its pivotal role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, hinting at a promising horizon for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s 11th AMA sheds light on the future of scalability and security, factors crucial for understanding Ethereum\u2019s positioning in a post-halving crypto market.\n\nWhy should you invest in Ethereum in 2024?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum in 2024 could be a strategic move for various reasons, based on insights from multiple sources:\n\n1. An ecosystem of dApps\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s largest ecosystem for dApps. With almost 3000 dApps running on its blockchain, Ethereum offers a wide range of utilities beyond simple transactions, including DeFi games, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more. This diverse application base could drive further demand for Ethereum.\n\n2. Ethereum Merge completion\n\nThe Ethereum Merge, transitioning the network from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), marks a significant upgrade. It makes Ethereum greener and more scalable, which could attract more users and developers, potentially increasing the value of Ethereum over time.\n\n3. Innovation and uncensorable apps\n\nEthereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of uncensorable applications, providing a level of freedom not controlled by central authorities. This capability emphasizes its role in fostering innovation across various sectors, including electricity, healthcare, and finance, positioning Ethereum as a host for groundbreaking solutions.\n\n4. Staking rewards\n\nWith the shift to PoS, Ethereum staking has become an avenue for earning passive income. Stakers contribute to network security and, in return, receive rewards. This not only supports the Ethereum ecosystem but also offers a sustainable earning opportunity for investors.\n\n5. Long-term price potential\n\nAlthough predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently speculative, some analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term trajectory. Anticipations of continued growth in the DeFi sector and Ethereum\u2019s fundamental strengths suggest the potential for price appreciation in the years to come.\n\nThese reasons highlight Ethereum\u2019s pivotal role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domains, emphasizing its potential as a valuable investment in 2024. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile, and investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial situation and risk tolerance before investing.\n\nConsider the broader market dynamics with a look at the impact of Bitcoin ETFs and three events that could trigger a bull run, offering perspectives on Ethereum\u2019s market potential in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s cyclical events.\n\nSumming up\n\nIn conclusion, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and its effect will be a watershed moment for Bitcoin and Ethereum. While it\u2019s clear that the event will have far-reaching implications, the exact nature of its impact on Ethereum\u2019s market remains to be seen.\n\nAs such, both investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor the developments leading up to and following the halving, as they will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s market in the years to come."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana All Jumped Double-Digits This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin jumped again this week as investors flooded into the crypto industry.\n\nThe crypto market came to life this week as Bitcoin (BTC -0.33%) passed $52,000 and the $1 trillion market cap level. As of noon ET on Friday, Bitcoin is up 10.2% over the past seven days and is holding strong.\n\nBitcoin isn't the only winner in crypto. Ethereum (ETH -0.67%) is up 12.2% to $2,784 per token and high-throughput blockchain Solana (SOL -0.19%) is up 4.7%, although it was up over 10% for the week just a few hours ago.\n\nWhat's driving the crypto market\n\nThe simple driver of crypto right now is the flow of funds into the industry. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen hundreds of millions of dollars of inflows this week alone and now holds over 100,000 Bitcoins. That's enough to inflate the entire market.\n\nBitcoin's rise is particularly interesting given competing forces in the market. A strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates have typically correlated to Bitcoin declining, but that trend is being offset by tech and growth stocks rising, which Bitcoin is directly correlated with.\n\nTraders have speculated that Bitcoin has become a safe haven for international investors or there's an increased pool of buyers because of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but the reality is money is coming into Bitcoin at a much faster pace than it's going out and that's driving the price.\n\nEthereum and Solana keep up\n\nEthereum is up in part because traders are expecting it to be the next crypto ETF. That would be the natural next step, although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn't said it will allow any ETFs beyond Bitcoin's.\n\nSolana could be another ETF candidate, but it's up in part because of airdrops in the ecosystem that has brought more liquidity and value, some of which is flowing back to the Solana token.\n\nIt's not unusual for tokens like Ethereum and Solana to climb alongside Bitcoin and that's at least one of the drivers of the tokens this week.\n\nWhat's ahead for crypto?\n\nOutside of just token values rising, Coinbase Global's earnings release this week showed optimism about crypto exchanges and also crypto use cases. Coinbase is seeing more adoption among institutions and developers and is also pushing for regulatory clarity about what's a security and what isn't in crypto.\n\nAs the industry leader in the U.S., Coinbase's position and activism are very important to the crypto industry and when it's reporting healthy financial results that bodes well for the industry.\n\nI think all of these factors working together are very bullish for cryptocurrencies in general and even exchanges and development companies like Coinbase. But it'll be a bumpy ride and the gains earned this week could evaporate next week. So, prepare for the volatility ahead -- any dips could be a buying opportunity for investors."

        "title": "Raoul Pal Predicts Massive Rally for Ethereum And Solana In Current Bull Cycle - TradingView",
        "content": "ZyCrypto\n\nRenowned macro-investor and Real Vision founder Raoul Pal has predicted a massive rally for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in the ongoing bull cycle.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast with Anthony Scaramucci, founder of global alternative investment firm SkyBridge Capital, Pal discussed the factors driving the growth of cryptocurrencies and their potential to save economies from a monetary meltdown.\n\nPal explained that the current debt cycle and the debasement of currency by central banks are driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies. He believes that people are looking for alternative investments due to the fear of a potential global economic meltdown caused by excessive debt and the devaluation of fiat currencies. He also mentioned that the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is creating new use cases and driving up the adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhen asked about his confidence in the growth of Ethereum and Solana, Pal stated that he believes ETH will reach a price of between $15,000 and $20,000 in this bull cycle. The pundit further underscored that SOL will reach a price of $750 and $1,000 in the same period.\n\nHe emphasized that he is very aggressively positioned in crypto as he believes that the issues of printing of money and excess debt will be the feature of the next two years and crypto will be the best-performing asset class.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually 100% of my liquid net worth in [crypto] and I have been actually for since 2020. And I use the bear markets to add into because I think we are in a once in a lifetime wealth accumulation opportunity for everybody be rich or poor,\u201d said Pal.\n\nNotably, the pundit did not provide a specific timeline for when he expects the crypto market to reach its peak. However, many experts are closely monitoring the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin bull market has historically started around 12 to 18 months after a halving event. If this pattern were to repeat itself, the next bull market peak would likely be in the third or fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nPal also discussed the role of gold and silver in the current economic climate, stating that while they have always played a role as a global store of wealth, they do not work as well in a digital age. He emphasized he prefers crypto over the two assets, as it offers the same benefits and has the added advantage of a technology super-cycle behind it.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,790 after a 7.73% surge in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, SOL was exchanging hands at $110, reflecting a 3.51% gain over the same period."

The quarter marked a turnaround to profit with a net income of $273 million, a stark contrast to the $2 million loss in the previous quarter and the first profitable quarter since Q4 2021.\n\nTransactional activity was central to Coinbase\u2019s income, with consumer crypto trading pulling in $493 million\u2014a near doubling from the third quarter\u2014and institutional transaction revenue increasing twofold to $36.7 million. The exchange processed over $29 billion in consumer trading volume, a 164% rise from the previous quarter.\n\nSubscriptions and services also contributed notably to revenues, generating $375.4 million, a share of which was derived largely from stablecoin and blockchain rewards, amounting to $171.6 million and $95.1 million, respectively.\n\nArmstrong added, \"For anybody worried about cannibalization, ETFs have been positive for the industry, which has been additive for Coinbase.

        "content": "However, although disagreement is extremely important in finance, in this paper we intend to sidestep the fundamental discussion about cryptocurrencies. We will focus instead on the cold, hard numbers, and examine the return, risk, and correlations of the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market shares \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will then use those numbers to provide some insights into whether they justify an allocation, and to what extent. And we will examine that in the context of three industry standard approaches to portfolio construction \u2013 the Global Market Portfolio, Risk Parity, and Optimization. Each have their own merits and idiosyncrasies, and each will attack potential allocations to cryptocurrencies from a slightly different angle. Sure, it might not be as much fun as a full-blooded and torrid debate, but it will be based on facts and well-researched forecasts, and not opinions \u2013 surely not a bad thing for investors. Figure One alludes to one of the many ways in which digital assets are disrupting traditional finance. It shows the indexed returns to several traditional assets (global stocks and bonds, denominated in US dollars), as well as the returns to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies to date which together account for approximately 70% of the space. Note that we use post-2017 data to accommodate for data availability, mainstream media awareness for the asset class, and growing institutional interest (e.g., Bitcoin CME futures launching in 2017).\n\nHowever, before you conclude that Bitcoin and Ethereum have generated returns broadly like traditional assets, but with a more volatile path, take another careful look at the chart. You will see that we have had to present the returns on a compressed scale on the left-hand side of the chart (technically known as a \u201csemi-log scale\u201d). And the reason is that because the cryptocurrency returns have been so extreme (effectively exponential) that showing everything on a more usual linear scale would reduce the bond and stock market returns to, effectively, a flat line."

        "content": "A DeFi trader's apparent $30,000 to $1.1 million gain from trading Pandora was largely due to receiving tokens via Sablier, not just market buys.\n\nSablier is a DeFi platform used by projects to distribute tokens on a payroll or as part of a token vesting schedule.\n\nThe apparent success of a DeFi trader turning nearly $30,000 into $1.1 million in five days has sparked widespread fascination.\n\nThe anonymous trader, who owns the Ethereum wallet 0x88, invested in Pandora, a buzzy Ethereum token and NFT hybrid. And DeFi users keen on monitoring onchain data \u2014 DeFi trading is transparent thanks to public blockchains \u2014 noted their purported $1 million earnings.\n\nThe tale of instant riches inspires hope in many punters of DeFi.\n\nBut a closer examination by DL News suggests the situation is more complex than initially thought.\n\nAnalysis of the trader\u2019s wallet history shows that they didn\u2019t market-buy all the Pandora tokens they eventually sold; rather, they received more than half of the tokens from Sablier.\n\nSablier is a DeFi platform used by projects to distribute tokens on a payroll or as part of a token vesting schedule. Generally, tokens are only vested if there was a token pre-sale or a similar arrangement.\n\nBut according to messages seen by DL News on a Telegram channel run by the Pandora team, a pre-sale was not conducted. Pandora did not immediately respond to DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nPandora emerged last week as the first implementation of the new \u2014 untested and experimental \u2014 ERC404 token standard that exists as both a token and an NFT.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn order to hold the NFT a user must buy at least one whole fungible token. If they then sell that token, or a fraction of the token, the NFT is burned, or removed from the supply.\n\nOpening Pandora\u2019s box\n\nThe mysterious trader held a total of 78 Pandora tokens worth $2.5 million at the token\u2019s peak. Although the trader did purchase tokens in the project early, their gains did not all come from market purchases. Most of the gains came from the tokens received via Sablier.\n\nThe story began on February 4 when the Pandora project gave them what\u2019s called a Sablier Lockup NFT, which represents ownership of 45 Pandora tokens.\n\nAfter receiving 45 Pandora tokens via Sablier, the mysterious trader also made a series of token purchases. They bought 33.59 Pandora tokens at an average price of $889, before spreading their sales over 35 transactions as the token rallied some 3,500%.\n\nThe 0x88 wallet sold 77 Pandora tokens across 35 transactions. (Dexscreener)\n\nThe trader\u2019s wallet had direct interactions with a few other wallets, which indicates they may be connected in some way, either the same individual controls them all, or the wallets are part of a larger group of individuals.\n\nThe first, wallet 0x22, seems to be a transit wallet without any special features. Another wallet, 0x0d has a balance of $172,000 and is actively airdrop-farming on protocols like Manta, Blur, and Blast. Lastly, wallet 0x2c, which is only two days old, already holds almost $1 million \u2014 coming directly from the trader\u2019s Pandora wallet.\n\nPandora's price\n\nSince launching on February 2, the project has done over $550 million in trading volume on decentralised exchanges and over $3 million in volume on NFT marketplaces on Ethereum.\n\nThe success of Pandora has also led to dozens of other projects launching ERC404 collections, resulting in gas spikes on Ethereum mainnet and numerous suspected rug pulls.\n\nThe total market value for ERC404 projects sits at $151 million, with nearly $21 million in total trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "content": "Almost 8,300 validators each with 32 ETH are currently waiting in line to begin staking, while 161 validators are trying to exit, a sign of continued interest in restaking.\n\nThe number of Ethereum validators waiting to enter the network is at its highest mark since the start of October.\n\nThe queue for validators to start securing the Ethereum network is significantly longer than the line for validators to relinquish their responsibilities of confirming blocks, a sign of interest in restaking, the practice of re-using ether (ETH) already securing the base layer of Ethereum in additional ways. The more validators that are securing the Ethereum blockchain, the more ETH is available to be restaked.\n\nThe enter queue is 51 times bigger than the exit queue at press time, according to data provided by blockchain explorer beaconcha.in. Nearly 8,300 validators each with 32 ETH are currently waiting in line to begin staking, while 161 validators are trying to exit.\n\nThe validator queue is a mechanism aimed at stabilizing Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus. If validators didn\u2019t have to wait, a huge and sudden influx of ETH could either enter or exit, causing an abrupt change in the security system for the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization.\n\nThe number of validators waiting to enter the network is at its highest mark since the start of October. At press time, the number of active validators \u2013 those currently securing the Ethereum blockchain and not waiting in the queue \u2013 exceeds 943,000.\n\n\u201cThe validator queue started to increase in the beginning of Feb, while the ETH staking yield is still below 4%. This [increase] coincides with EigenLayer\u2019s staking cap raise on 2/5,\u201d wrote Kelly Ye, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nARVE Error: src mismatch\n\nprovider: youtube\n\nurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxsVKw7SdAs&t=7s\n\n\n\nsrc: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs?start=7&feature=oembed\n\nsrc mod: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs?start=7\n\nsrc gen: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs\n\n\n\nError: src mismatch\n\nMore ETH Available to Be Restaked\n\nWith 32 ETH each, the roughly 8,300 validators will bring in about $746.3 million in total to secure Ethereum. Consequently, this also means that more ETH is available to be restaked.\n\nEigen Layer, the protocol widely known for its restaking technique that extends Ethereum\u2019s security to additional applications and networks, has been a popular destination for crypto denizens\u2019 liquid staking tokens (LST).\n\nPeople have been able to deposit their LSTs into EigenLayer, but the team placed caps on each LST pool. The team has temporarily lifted caps on the number of LSTs people can deposit into the protocol several times. The latest cap raise occurred on Feb. 5, which saw the value locked in EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts more than triple from $2.156 billion to nearly $7.034 billion in 10 days, data from DefiLlama shows.\n\nAs the number of validators entering the population outpaces those leaving, the rewards per validator will continue to shrink. Ethereum staking APR started at above 5% in June 2023 and has since decreased 129 basis points to nearly 3.8% at press time, according to data provided by beaconcha.in.\n\nHowever, Decentral\u2019s Ye noted that \u201cwe expect ETH staking interest to continue to grow as the staking theme continues to grow. ETH currently has about 32.5% staked, which is still lower than other big [proof-of-stake] chains.\u201d\n\nThe price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency for Ethereum, has increased 3.2% in the past 24 hours and 17.5% over the past seven days to trade at $2,851, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRonin, a Ethereum sidechain designed for blockchain games, announced Thursday that it will reduce RON token rewards paid to liquidity providers on its Katana decentralized exchange (DEX) starting in March.\n\nSky Mavis, the company behind the network and its flagship game Axie Infinity, said that it plans to cut liquidity pool token emissions in multiple waves, slashing the daily token rewards by approximately 50% each time. Doing so will reduce the number of tokens being added to the circulating supply on a daily basis.\n\nThe network said that the average annual percentage rate (APR) for providing liquidity has jumped from around 20% to 70% in recent months. However, the amount of tokens pooled has not grown proportionally to match the increase in rewards.\n\n\"This means the increase in reward value did not drive meaningful outcomes in DEX liquidity provision, and may have gone past the optimal level of incentives,\" the announcement said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, rewards will be reduced in phases. The first phase, planned for March 1, will cut emissions by over 60,000 RON per day, or around 5.4 million RON per quarter. At the current price, that\u2019s a cut of more than $174,000 worth per day or $15.6 million worth each quarter.\n\nAdditional phases will continue reducing rewards over the course of 2024. The reduction aims to curb \"over-incentivization\" of liquidity providers and lead to better equilibrium for token prices, according to the network. It will also free up more of the RON token supply for other initiatives that could drive user growth.\n\nThe market reacted positively to the news, as the price of RON jumped shortly after the announcement, according to data from CoinGecko. Ronin is up 7% on the day to a current price of $2.90, pushing the token\u2019s 30-day gains to 56%. RON was just listed on major crypto exchange Binance earlier this month, which was cited as one of the reasons behind this rewards cut.\n\nThe network has seen a dramatic rise in active users over the last few months after the blockchain-based farming game Pixels migrated over from Polygon in October. Pixels will launch its own PIXEL token on February 19 after running a play-to-airdrop campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

\ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nUniswap v4's launch is tentatively set for Q3 2024.\n\n\n\nFrom community-built Hooks (https://t.co/WyaGr1Ti1t), to events, to Twitter Spaces, the\u2026 \u2014 Uniswap Foundation (@UniswapFND) February 15, 2024\n\nThe new version of the industry-leading DEX will leverage the recent Ethereum improvement proposals (EIP, specifically EIP-4788, EIP-1153, and EIP-4844) for a more efficient utilization of liquidity in the platform\u2019s pools.\n\nWith v4, the concept of \u201chook\u201d will be introduced for the first time in DeFi, which allows the injection of custom logic at specifically designated points for pools, swaps, fees, and other LP positions.\n\nThis amplifies the use cases of Uniswap and explores new solutions for smart contract engagement, with significant reductions in gas fees and always immediate interactions, combined with better resource management for end users.\n\nThe positive effects of Dencun on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nWhile Uniswap awaits the implementation of Dencun on the Ethereum blockchain, the community of the world\u2019s leading smart contract platform is buzzing with excitement for one of the most significant updates ever witnessed so far.\n\nDencun was previously launched on January 17th on the Goerli testnet (with some difficulties and a 4-hour delay) specifically to test some new features.\n\nOn January 31st, it was then the turn of the Sepolia testnet, and finally on February 11th, the Holesky testnet, completing the final preparations before the arrival in mainnet.\n\nNow the official launch to the general public, as highlighted by the blockchain research company \u201cNethermind\u201d, is scheduled for March 13th at 13:55:35 UTC, at block height \u201c8626176\u201d.\n\nThe Ethereum developers have decided on the official launch date unanimously during the so-called consensus level call 127 after the success of Holesky.\n\nEthereum's Dencun upgrade is set for March 13.\n\n\n\nIt introduces several key changes, including EIP-4844, EIP-1153, and EIP-4788.\n\n\n\nHow will Dencun affect L2 valuations, and what does this have to do with Uniswap?\n\n\n\nSubscribe and read to find out.https://t.co/0fHx7Y3Zd7 \u2014 Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) February 15, 2024\n\nFrom a technical point of view, Dencun will enable a new type of transaction called \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d that will help reduce transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s rollups, with obvious benefits also for DEXs like Uniswap.\n\nMore precisely, the \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d is a preliminary measure of the technical functionality of \u201cdanksharding\u201d, which opens the doors to future implementations on the L1 backbone infrastructure.\n\nFor now, Dencun will be responsible for compressing the transaction data contained in the rollups and storing part of it in an external storage, helping to reduce the weight of the blocks and thus reducing fees for the end user.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the same update will help reduce the cost of data available on Ethereum, creating advantageous conditions for projects such as Celestia, Avail, and EigenDA.\n\nWith the L2 market on Ethereum experiencing strong growth, as reported by the increase in the overall TVL of this sector, we expect Dencun to revolutionize the aspect of network scaling by bringing greater efficiency and a larger influx of new users."

        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying at an impressive rate alongside its peer Bitcoin, which almost touched $53,000 on Thursday. Investors seem to be spoilt for choice, especially with altcoins making incredible strides. As discussed earlier today, investors are likely to start redistributing capital from Bitcoin profits into altcoins, propping tokens like ETH for a larger breakout targeting $4,000 in Q1.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: A Rally In The Making\n\nEthereum price bullish outlook comes amid impressive performance of Bitcoin ETFs which achieved a humongous cumulative net inflow of $4 billion on February 1.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInvestors perceive this surge as validation of Bitcoin and crypto from traditional investors. ETFs allow institutions to seek exposure to BTC without dealing with the complexities associated with navigating exchanges, owning physical digital and assets which require special custody services.\n\nAway from the BTC ETF, Ethereum is poised for a larger breakout due to the upcoming Dencun upgrade. All three testnet launches have been completed implying that developers will be announcing the final dates for the mainnet debut before the end of Q1.\n\nOptimism for a spot Ethereum ETF has also started to build. Following the approval of BTC ETFs, speculators turned to Ethereum as the next-in-line digital asset.\n\nThe approval of an Ether ETF, although a long shot at the moment, considering the hawkish stance of regulators in the US on whether Ethereum is a security or not, is expected to drive prices higher as witnessed with Bitcoin.\n\nAmid these expectations and potential market mover factors, Ethereum seeks a breakout above $2,800 to extend the leg to $3,000 and subsequently to $3,600 before the end of February.\n\nFor starters, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator backs the uptrend, displaying a buy signal and green histograms above the neutral area.\n\nIf interest in ETH continues this week, holding above $2,800 would signal confidence in the uptrend and possibly ignite FOMO among investors as they speculate on further price increases this week.\n\nSupport is expected at $2,700 on the downside. However, if profit-taking destabilises Ethereum price, traders may want to consider $2,500 and $2,200 as key support areas.\n\nBlockchain data by IntoTheBlock reveals that over 7.8 million Ethereum addresses are currently in profit, while 5.45 million addresses deal with unrealized losses.\n\nThe largest support area stands out at $2,365 \u2014 the average price at which 1.72 million wallets purchased slightly over 5 million ETH. Based on the chart below, Ethereum price has a higher chance of rallying to higher levels above $3,000 as opposed to dropping to January\u2019s support at $2,200.\n\nThat said, Ethereum could still be a steal if bought at the current market value. In case of dips to lower support areas, consider a dollar-cost average strategy to make the most out of the sublime bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "The recent movement of a sizeable quantity of Ethereum (ETH) from Binance to an unidentified wallet, as revealed by Whale Alert, has generated a great deal of curiosity and conjecture in the cryptocurrency world. This transaction, which involved 11,999 ETH worth over $31.8 million, demonstrates that whales are responding strategically to the state of the market.\n\nThe positive mood has been prevalent in the cryptocurrency market, as evidenced by the large rises in Ethereum and other altcoins, as well as in Bitcoin. Whale Alert\u2019s latest observations suggest that whales of ETH might be taking advantage of this momentum by hoarding more of the cryptocurrency, possibly in anticipation of future price rises.\n\nSignificant cryptocurrency transfers from exchanges to private wallets frequently indicate bullish optimism among leading market participants. These transfers may lead to price increases if demand increases or stays constant since they decrease the amount of goods offered on exchanges. A further layer of intrigue to market dynamics is provided by the activation of a dormant premine address containing 100 ETH after 8.5 years, which suggests the return of long-term holders to the market.\n\nThe idea of heightened market interest and perhaps optimistic mood is further supported by the present price of Ethereum, as well as by the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent performance and the spike in Open Interest in Ethereum futures. These occurrences are critical events that might point to important changes in the dynamics of the Ethereum market and have an impact on future price movements.\n\nEthereum Gains Momentum\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s euphoric ascent reaching $50,000, focus is now turning to Ethereum, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Regarding ETH\u2019s future course, there is also growing optimism among analysts, including Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, as reported by TWJ.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current price, as reported by Coinmarketcap, is $2,661.01. Almost 180% more has been traded for the digital asset in a 24-hour period, with a volume of almost 19 billion. ETH has increased by 7.11% in the last 24 hours and by 14.53% on the weekly chart. This optimistic momentum highlights ETH\u2019s tenacity and suggests room for more expansion."

        "title": "This Is How Much You Would Need to Spend to Execute 51% Attacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "A 51% attack occurs when a single network miner or group of miners controls more than half of a blockchain network\u2019s hash rate. Theoretically, this would enable the attacker to block transactions from taking place in the blockchain, alter the sequence of new transactions, and potentially revert past transactions (referred to as \u201cdouble spending\u201d) by tampering with blockchain data.\n\nHowever, a recent study indicates that executing such attacks is financially unviable within the current security setups of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAttacking Bitcoin and Ethereum Not Worthwhile\n\nWith reference to December 31, 2023, and considering an Ethereum price of $2,279, a total staked ETH amounting to 28.8 million ETH, and a validator count of 899,840 validators, CoinMetrics\u2019 calculations suggest that an attacker would need around $34.39 billion to execute a 34% attack on the network.\n\nIf the assault were to commence on December 31, 2023, it would require the attacker until June 14, 2024, to breach the 33% threshold to gain control over the network.\n\nAttacking Bitcoin would also prove to be equally far-fetched. Researchers estimate that the attacker would face production expenses of over $20 billion, as they would need to manufacture nearly 40 million units of the S9.\n\nUsing the most powerful ASIC available, like the upcoming Bitmain S21, would cost around $5.6 billion by December 2023, roughly a quarter of the expense of using the S9. This estimation is based on a unit cost of $2,240 and a production volume of 2.5 million machines.\n\nWhile more cost-effective than the \u201cnaive\u201d approach, the research asserted that manufacturing at this efficiency and scale would require cooperation with the manufacturer. However, the attacker would probably encounter supply chain issues and potential retaliation.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that the current state of security in Bitcoin and Ethereum makes attacks economically unfeasible and provides empirical evidence of Nash Equilibrium in these networks.\u201d\n\nThe study concluded that the security measures of Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached a level where the costs and dangers linked with 51% attacks significantly outweigh the potential benefits. It indicates that hostile actions become less appealing when compared to alternative strategies like honest engagement in the network or refraining from attacking.\n\n51% Attack Risks Extend Beyond Leading Blockchains\n\nThe assessment may be true for top blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the same cannot be said for many other networks that have surfaced in the past decade.\n\nBitcoin SV, a blockchain formed as a split from Bitcoin Cash and championed primarily by entrepreneurs Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright, experienced three instances of 51% attacks in 2021. Similarly, the lesser-known privacy-focused crypto Firo, previously known as Zcoin, faced a similar ordeal. Even Ethereum Classic wasn\u2019t spared by rogue actors."

        "content": "The XRP price is currently struggling to retain $0.52, with commentators dubbing the token undervalued, but what could this price be if XRP captured the $299 billion market cap of Ethereum?\n\nXRP retained the spot as the second-largest crypto asset at some point, only below Bitcoin (BTC), the firstborn cryptocurrency, in market capitalization. The crypto asset overtook Litecoin (LTC) in market cap in 2015 and held the second spot until 2016, when Ethereum (ETH) stole the show.\n\nXRP Battled Ethereum for Second Spot\n\nXRP battled Ethereum for the second spot from 2016 to 2018, eventually reclaiming it in December 2017 when its market cap soared to $95.8 billion while Ethereum remained at the $70 billion mark. ETH retook the spot after a brief period, but the supremacy battle lingered until late 2019.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum has continued to hold the second spot since then, with the SEC lawsuit, which came up in December 2020, exerting more bearish pressure on XRP. While Ethereum\u2019s market cap soared to a high of $575 billion in November 2021 during the bull run, XRP only had a valuation of $60 billion.\n\nOver the years, XRP has also relinquished the third and fourth spots to Binance Coin (BNB) and Tether (USDT). Most recently, it gave up the fifth spot to a rallying Solana (SOL), whose market cap has now skyrocketed past $47 billion amid the reclamation of a $100 price.\n\nXRP now sits sixth among the largest crypto assets by market cap, with a valuation of $28.5 billion at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, USDC, Circle\u2019s stablecoin, boasts a market cap of $27.9 billion despite its woes last year.\n\nXRP Price at $299B Market Cap\n\nSeveral XRP proponents have bemoaned the asset\u2019s underperformance over the years, as it goes from a competitive stance against Ethereum to relegating itself to the sixth position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nWhile some market analysts predict an imminent comeback from XRP, these projections remain speculative at this time. However, if XRP had followed a similar growth trajectory to Ethereum\u2019s, what would its price be right now, considering its current circulating supply?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum currently has a market cap of $299 billion at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, XRP\u2019s circulating supply comes in at 54.5 billion coins, per CoinMarketCap (CMC) data. If XRP had imitated Ethereum\u2019s growth to reach the $299 billion valuation, its price right now would be $5.53.\n\nNotably, this price would represent a new all-time high for XRP, which currently trades for $0.5227. XRP would need to skyrocket by a massive 957% from its current value to clinch the $5.53 price.\n\nIf XRP achieves a market capitalization of $1 trillion like Bitcoin, XRP price would be approximately $18."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to lead the market north, with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices following the intermediate trend. However, as the apex cryptocurrency faces a formidable blockade, the market could correct soon before the next leg up. Low trading volumes characteristic of weekends is one factor to consider, and volatility is likely to increase over the next two days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC eyes $60,000 but correction looms\n\nBitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. What are altcoins? Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. What is Bitcoin Dominance? Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\nBitcoin price could correct as weekend volatility settles in\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has made three successive attempts to shatter past the upper boundary of the ascending parallel channel at $53,000. However, the efforts have been futile, likely because of buyer exhaustion as BTC is already overbought, indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position above 70.\n\nAmid low trading volumes characteristic of weekends, increased volatility could see Bitcoin price drop 5% to the $49,170 support level. In a dire case, the drop could extend to the confluence between the midline of the channel and the upper boundary of the supply zone at $46,760. A break and close below the midline of this order block at $45,554 would confirm the extension of the fall.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, with the bulls still having a strong presence in the BTC market, evidenced by the large volumes of green histogram bars in positive territory, Bitcoin price could shatter the $53,000 barricade. In a highly bullish case, the gains could extrapolate 5% to the $55,000 level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Prediction: $55,000 in sight despite overbought state as BTC adversary turns coat\n\nEthereum price to provide another buying opportunity\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is likely to retract, giving sidelined investors another buying opportunity and delaying the $3,000 milestone for a while. The likely target for the drop is the confluence between the horizontal line and the midline of the channel at $2,689, around 7% below current levels.\n\nIn a dire case, Ethereum price could pivot around the $2,600 support, levels last tested on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, with bulls still at play, Ethereum price could extend the gains to clear the range high at $2,867. In a highly bullish case, the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token could extend a neck north to the $3,000 psychological level, a milestone last tested on April 5.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum follow as BTC shows no signs of stopping\n\nRipple price faces strong overhead pressure\n\nRipple (XRP) price is suffering the weight of growing overhead pressure due to the 100 and 200-day SMAs at $0.5889 and $0.5671, respectively. Resistance due to the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel has reinforced the pressure.\n\nIf XRP bulls show weakness, Ripple price could drop to lose support due to the 50-day SMA at $0.5510. An extended fall could send the payments token to the $0.5368 support, or in a dire case, retest the midline of the channel, which coincides with the Parabolic SAR at $0.5000. Such a move would denote a 10% drop below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nMeanwhile, with XRP bulls still maintaining a presence in the market, as seen by the MACD position in positive territory, Ripple price could foray north, shattering the roadblocks to hit the $0.6000 psychological level. In a highly bullish case, the XRP price could extend to the $0.6421 resistance level, last tested on December 28.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price could climb to $1 target if Ripple scores another win in SEC lawsuit"

        "content": "Genesis Global has been approved by the bankruptcy court to sell around 35 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with an estimated value of $1.3 billion. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision during a court hearing held in White Plains, New York.\n\nThis approval authorizes Genesis to monetize its holdings of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust.\n\nGenesis to Sell its GBTC Shares\n\nIn addition to the $1.3 billion in GBTC shares, Genesis intends to sell over 11 million shares in two Grayscale Ethereum Trusts, with a combined value exceeding $200 million, as detailed in a court filing dated February 2.\n\nThis will result in a total of approximately $1.6 billion shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) combined.\n\nHowever, Genesis\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, attempted to delay the proposed sale until after the bankruptcy court decides on the subsidiary\u2019s debt repayment plan, which is scheduled for later this month. DCG expressed concerns that premature Grayscale share sales could depress prices, minimizing potential recoveries for Genesis creditors.\n\nJeffrey Saferstein, representing DCG, also emphasized the need for careful consideration to avoid the rapid unloading of shares. Additionally, DCG sought the right to seek input on selling Grayscale shares.\n\nDespite these objections, Judge Sean Lane ruled in favor of Genesis, asserting the company\u2019s right to determine the strategic sale of its assets. He emphasized that the sales would be conducted over time with the assistance of a broker to prevent any rapid unloading of shares, which could adversely affect prices.\n\nLane justified his decision by highlighting the \u201cconsiderable expertise\u201d of Genesis and its creditors in crypto, suggesting that they are well-equipped to maximize the value of the Grayscale shares.\n\nSEC and NY Attorney General Settlement\n\nMeanwhile, Genesis is moving forward with its liquidation plan, which entails shutting down the company and repaying customers in cash or cryptocurrency, depending on the nature of their deposits.\n\nThe company has reached settlements with the U.S. SEC and New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this month, resolving their objections to its bankruptcy plan.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlements, the SEC will be paid a $21 million fine if Genesis has any surplus funds after repaying customers. Furthermore, any funds recovered from the bankruptcy proceedings will be used by the New York Attorney General to assist creditors allegedly defrauded by Genesis."

        "content": "The unique active addresses metric was yet to break out of a two-year downtrend.\n\nAnalysis of the liquidation levels showed ETH bulls could be in for a surprise.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has traded within a range since mid-December. This range extended from $2116 to $2614, and its mid-point at $2365 has served as a significant horizontal level over the past ten weeks.\n\nOn Monday, the 12th of February, Ethereum bulls achieved a daily trading session close at $2659, above the range highs. Since then, short liquidations have also increased as prices continued to soar.\n\nAnalyzing whether the active address count spurred this rally\n\nA massive uptick in unique active addresses accompanied the 2017 and 2020-21 bull run. Moreover, beyond November 2021, when the active address count began to decrease, ETH bulls made an attempt to push prices past the $4k mark. They were met with failure.\n\nThe current rally that Ethereum is on stretches back to October 2023. The 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the active addresses shows a gradual uptrend, according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\nHowever, considering the past two years, the metric has not set a series of higher lows and higher highs. Therefore, a true uptrend on the higher timeframe was not yet established for the active addresses metric.\n\nYet, ETH prices reached a high not seen since May 2022. This suggested that the coming months and years could see users flock to the Ethereum network alongside an enormous increase in demand, and subsequently, price.\n\nThe derivative markets showed intense bullish sentiment\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed the Open Interest (OI) data of the past three years from CryptoQuant. The higher timeframe uptrends have been accompanied by a sustained uptrend in the OI, showing bullish sentiment amongst speculators.\n\nSince October 2023, the 7-day SMA of the OI rose from $1.7 billion on 1st October to stand at $6.74 billion on 15th February. The climbing OI alongside the rally meant bullish conviction remained strong in the futures markets.\n\nThe Liquidation Levels Heatmap from Hyblock was examined to understand where the next areas of interest lay. AMBCrypto noted that the $2730-$2835 pocket was breached. This zone was estimated to have multiple liquidation levels measuring anywhere from $10 billion to $15 billion.\n\nETH would likely face a rejection near the $2900 mark after sweeping these giant liquidity pockets. The liquidity near $3000, based on the six-month look-back chart above, was scant. A deep retracement back toward the $2000 zone to take out the liquidations there made sense.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt was unclear if this bearish move would materialize, given the strength of bulls in recent weeks.\n\nA move below $2500 would be necessary to give credence to expectations of a drop to $2000. Until then, a drop toward the $2500-$2600 region would present a buying opportunity."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could extend gains by 5% to $55,000 as BTC bulls hold their breath.\n\nEthereum price could leap 7% to $3,000 if ETH bulls keep their profit appetite in check.\n\nRipple price garners strength for an 11% move to $0.6000, levels last tested on January 12.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pumping hard, with altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) following in line. The apex cryptocurrency continues to recover some of the ground lost during the past years.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price posts a new range high as Gensler details economic difference between BTC and the US Dollar\n\nBitcoin eyes $55,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price could take $55,000 soon, a 5% climb above current levels that does not seem so far right now. With strong technical indicators behind it, BTC is confronting resistance at the upper boundary of the ascending channel.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, suggesting rising momentum that could send Bitcoin price higher. The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are also flashing green with large volumes in positive territory, showing a strong bullish presence in the BTC market. This is accentuated by the MACD moving higher above its signal line (orange band).\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, considering BTC is overbought, investors should not be surprised if a pullback happens, which could send Bitcoin price below the midline of the channel and into the supply zone (turned bullish breaker) between $44,300 and $46,760. A break and close below the $45,554 midline would confirm a continuation of the fall.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price $50,000 milestone short-lived as US CPI inflation signals persistent inflationary pressure\n\nEthereum price could leap to $3,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s $3,000 target is now within reach as ETH bulls keep their profit appetite in check. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token has breached resistance due to the midline of the channel with the potential for a 7% climb to the forecasted target.\n\nThe MACD and AO both show a strong bullish grip, while the RSI hints at rising momentum, which could ferry Ethereum price to the psychological level, last tested on April 26, 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nLike BTC, however, ETH is also overbought, with the RSI above 70. With this, a correction is likely, with Ethereum price likely to descend 6.5% to $2,600 or in a dire case, revisit the $2,500 level. Such a move would denote a 10% drop below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Classic price coils up for a breakout with $30 in the cards for ETC\n\nXRP bulls are back in the game\n\nRipple (XRP) price has sustained a recovery since early February, showing that XRP bulls are back in the game. With Bitcoin showing directional bias, altcoins are following and the remittance token is not far behind.\n\nWith the RSI above 50, coupled with a bullish effort seen in the green histogram bars of both the MACD and AO, Ripple price could extend the gains 11% to retake the $0.6000 psychological level.\n\nRipple price is sitting in the upper half of the Bollinger Bands, between the centerline and the upper band at $0.5196 and $0.5428, respectively. This accentuates the bullish thesis.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit booking could cut the rally short, sending XRP price below the midline of the channel. In a dire case, the altcoin could descend to the $0.4734 support floor, levels last seen on October 12.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple unveils plans for crypto custody while XRP price trades sideways"

        "content": "Crypto intelligence firm Coin Metrics has revealed in its latest research that it has become impractical for nation-states to dismantle the BTC and ETH network through 51% attacks, given the prohibitive expenses involved.\n\nA 51% attack involves gaining majority control over a network\u2019s hash rate in proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin or staking in proof-of-stake networks such as Ethereum, allowing for possible manipulation of the blockchain.\n\nThe study, conducted by Lucas Nuzzi, Kyle Waters, and Matias Andrade of Coin Metrics, introduces the \u201cTotal Cost to Attack\u201d (TCA) metric to estimate the expenses involved in such malicious activities. Their findings suggest that attacking either Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) would not be financially feasible or profitable for attackers, essentially nullifying the incentive for such actions.\n\n9 We also find no ways for a nation-state attacker to continuously run a 51% / 34% attack if the goal is to destroy these networks.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of retaliation techniques makes ideologically driven attacks costly at each retaliation round.\n\n\n\nIn the end, the network survives. \u2014 Lucas Nuzzi (@LucasNuzzi) February 15, 2024\n\nFor Bitcoin, the attempt to gain control would necessitate acquiring around 7 million ASIC mining rigs, an investment of about $20 billion. However, the market lacks the availability of such a vast number of ASIC rigs, and even if a potential attacker decided to manufacture them, the cost would still exceed $20 billion.\n\nProducing S9 mining rigs would incur costs exceeding $20 billion | Source: Coin Metrics\n\nThe scenario renders the attack not only impractical but also economically inefficient, with the most advantageous double-spend attack yielding a mere 2.5% return on a hypothetical $40 billion expenditure to gain $1 billion.\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase limits Zcash trading as ViaBTC poses risks of 51% attack\n\nEthereum faces a similar situation with its transition to a proof-of-stake model, where the report evaluated the feasibility of a 34% attack by Lido validators. The analysis concluded that any attempt to compromise the Ethereum network using Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) would be both costly, exceeding $34 billion, and time-consuming, taking up to six months due to the churn limit, which restricts immediate stake deployment.\n\nAttacking Ethereum with LSDs would cost over $34 billion | Source: Coin Metrics\n\nAdditionally, the logistical challenge of managing over 200 nodes and incurring significant expenses, such as $1 million on Amazon Web Services, further diminishes the plausibility of such an attack.\n\nNic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, commended the report for providing a detailed and empirical examination of the impracticality of 51% attacks on these leading cryptocurrency networks.\n\nHe noted that previous analyses lacked the concrete, data-driven approach seen in Coin Metrics\u2019 research, marking it as a pivotal contribution to understanding the security and resilience of Bitcoin and Ethereum against potential nation-state-level threats."

        "content": "There\u2019s plenty of talk recently about crypto going mainstream, triggered especially by events around spot bitcoin ETFs in the US. These products were approved and launched in January, which is significant in itself, but what has followed is a hugely impressive start, which has seen net flows for all BTC ETFs cumulatively surpass $3 billion, while two of the funds (IBIT and FBTC) are already\u2013despite being only around a month old\u2013in the top ten funds for year-to-date flows.\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Flows\n\nThe ETFs are center stage and demand has been relentless, but there are further indicators suggesting that crypto is coming in from the cold, with a series of recent announcements regarding tie-ups between crypto products and mainstream, well-known companies.\n\nEthereum Name Service and GoDaddy\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) has been around since May 2017, and is a domain name service operating on Ethereum Ethereum Ethereum is an open source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality. Created in 2014, Ethereum now stands as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap at the time of writing.As a decentralized cryptocurrency network and software platform, Ethereum represents the most prominent altcoin.

Ethereum also enables the creation Distributed Applications, or dapps. Understanding EthereumEthereum boasts its own programming language, Read this Term. What that means is that an Ethereum wallet address (which looks like a long, random string of numbers and letters) can be mapped to a readable, ownable domain name on the Ethereum blockchain Blockchain Blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or other altcoins.One of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.

The ledger can be public or private (permissioned). In this sense, blockchain is immune to the manipulation of data, making it not only open but verifiable. Because a blockchain is stored across a network of computers, it is very difficult to tamp Read this Term. Up to now, though, ENS domain ownership has been relatively niche, with distinctive .eth domain names common in crypto circles (or among Ethereum devotees, at least), but still\u2013from a wider perspective\u2013limited in adoption.\n\nAs such, it looks significant that ENS has now partnered with GoDaddy, one of the biggest names in regular (non-crypto) internet naming services and web hosting. With over 20 million users, GoDaddy is highly recognizable, and so a shift towards crypto\u2013and Ethereum specifically\u2013is worth noting, keeping in mind also that applications for spot ETH ETFs are currently being processed by the SEC.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to remember that ENS was never a direct competitor to GoDaddy and similar services, since the Ethereum-based product was not intended to supersede the standard Domain Naming Service (DNS). Rather, the intent was to work in parallel alongside regular mechanisms, and the ENS/GoDaddy collaboration underlines this ambition, providing easy inter-connection between Ethereum and established web architecture.\n\nDNS has been the internet's backbone for 40 years, but blockchain-based identifiers face limitations. Can supporting them with DNS create a more secure and integrated solution? Find out here:#DNS #Blockchain #InternetEvolution\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/QmjiUaKdE7 \u2014 GoDaddy (@GoDaddy) February 10, 2024\n\nThrough GoDaddy, users will be able to connect a standard DNS domain name with an Ethereum wallet address (just as ENS provides a connection between ENS domain name and wallet address). What\u2019s more, Ethereum gas fees (which vary and can at times be very expensive) are cut out of the equation through a mechanism called Gasless DNSSEC, which may be a critical factor, since excessive gas fees can be an obstacle to bringing on board new Ethereum users.\n\nMetaMask and Robinhood\n\nWhen it comes to crypto hot wallets, browser-based MetaMask\u2013with well over 22 million downloads since it launched in 2016\u2013is the dominant product, allowing users to hook up permissionlessly with DEXes, NFT marketplaces, and anything else web3-related.\n\nAnd when it comes to online stock trading aimed squarely at retail participants, Robinhood is among the most dominant platforms, with around 11 million monthly active users. Since 2018, Robinhood has also supported crypto trading, and so it now follows coherently that the trading platform has announced a partnership with MetaMask.\n\nWhat makes this connection stand out is that MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet option, meaning that users are holding their own assets without the need for a third party. By integrating with MetaMask, Robinhood is allowing users to buy crypto assets through Robinhood itself, but to custody them in their own wallets, creating a crossover between the centralized platforms of the regular web, and the more self-reliant ethos that is central to web3 and crypto.\n\nAnd again, as with the ENS/GoDaddy partnership, we\u2019re seeing crypto-native products seeking not to replace existing companies and ways of operating, but rather to work alongside them and establish connectivity.\n\nThe MetaMask/Robinhood partnership also establishes further on-ramps from traditional finance and fiat currency, to web3 products and crypto, potentially enabling broader crypto adoption. However, viewed alongside the new BTC ETFs, there\u2019s a key difference at play, as the ETFs enable exposure to bitcoin without needing on-ramps, while Robinhood and MetaMask are making it easier for users to actually hold their own crypto, which can then be put to use in decentralized applications.\n\nTransak and Visa\n\nIt was reported at the end of January that global payments giant Visa is entering into a partnership with crypto payments firm Transak. Again, this collaboration works to provide accessible connections between fiat and crypto, easing friction around off-ramps, and in the process solving a recurring concerns around crypto ownership: the need to be able to cash out easily when required.\n\nThe Transak/Visa partnership will enable real-time card withdrawals (from crypto to fiat), and remove complication around local crypto regulations, due to Transak\u2019s compliance with rules and regulations around the world, and its multiple licenses allowing operations in a variety of global regions.\n\nHere again, then, we have traditional finance and crypto (or, perhaps, web2 and web3) each playing to their respective strengths while moving towards integrated cooperation. This appears to be mutually beneficial for both sectors, and in that case, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are further partnerships still to come between traditional firms and crypto products."

These two crypto ecosystems are the leaders of the crypto market. But they are distinctly different in terms of their functionalities and advantages. Understanding this divergence can be crucial for your crypto investment choices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the safest crypto investment over Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is often nicknamed the \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its longevity and its increasing value over time. It is now widely regarded as a store of value and a hedge against often rampant inflation.\n\nMoreover, its simplicity and history make it an appealing choice for cautious, or even wary, investors. On this point, it stands out significantly from Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum firm.\n\nThe latter offers a decentralized platform that allows the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just limited to being a simple cryptocurrency.\n\nThanks to its flexibility, this platform paves the way to new prospects in various sectors such as finance and logistics, among others. This leads some to say that Ethereum represents decentralized innovation where Bitcoin is a safe investment choice. However, this doesn\u2019t always settle the question of choosing between these two crypto platforms.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum: how to make the choice?\n\nThe choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum mainly depends on your investment goals and your risk tolerance as an investor. Generally, Bitcoin is a good option if you\u2019re looking to preserve value, due to its stability and reputation as a safe asset.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for growth opportunities, Ethereum might be particularly attractive because of its potential for innovation and its diversity of applications. This characteristic makes it an undisputed solution in terms of application development, due to its structure that\u2019s especially suitable for deploying dApps in a relevant way.\n\nEither way, these two crypto platforms share one common factor. As with the majority of cryptocurrencies, they are subject to high volatility and face uncertain regulations in many regions around the world. Even though Bitcoin features a more established technology while Ethereum is constantly evolving with regular updates.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum will depend on your investor profile and your long-term goals. Hence the need to do your own research beforehand to take into account your particularities in terms of crypto investment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

The token is still up 10.82% for the week, but it has started to lose some of its gains, dropping from $2,841 to its current level in a matter of four hours. In that period, the token lost 2.6%.\n\nThis rapid drop could mean that Ethereum is in for more decline over the rest of the day and perhaps into the weekend as well.\n\nOn Monday, Ethereum started to gain momentum and moved from $2,824 up to 2,854 at its peak this week. The coin\u2019s high point was Thursday, and it held onto its gains into Friday morning until the bears got ahold of Ethereum. It appears that those ETH gains are now being cashed in. As the price declines, ETH\u2019s trade volume is dropping rapidly, down 21% over the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Strong Performance\n\nBitcoin (BTC) also dropped today, after a strong week that parallels Ethereum\u2019s performance week in a lot of ways. That leading coin started to climb sharply Tuesday as well, though the bulls were already busy with it Saturday.\n\nBitcoin climbed high this week, starting off Sunday at around the $48,000 level and going as high as $52,706 before the gains started to slow and the momentum tapered off. Bitcoin has been erratic today, moving between highs and lows as investors wait to see what will happen.\n\nBecause of its recent strong performance, many industry insiders are expecting Bitcoin to move higher very soon. They may just be in for a flat or declining weekend first.\n\nBitcoin had a rough January but has been on the rise through most of February, indicating that it could be headed to a much higher level very soon."

        "content": "A Solana-based (SOL) decentralized rendering altcoin is trading sideways despite the news that the top US crypto exchange platform would be adding support for it.\n\nIn a new announcement, Coinbase says that it\u2019s going to be listing Render (RENDER), a decentralized altcoin that allows users to share their unused GPU (graphics processing unit) power to render graphics and visual effects for other projects as a means of earning rewards.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will add support for Render on the Solana network (SPL token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on Coinbase and CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported.\u201d\n\nThe digital asset had a lukewarm response to the listing, as it is trading for $4.91 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease over the last 24 hours.\n\nRender used to be an Ethereum-based (ETH) token, but it switched over to Solana in late 2023. According to Jules Urbach, the project\u2019s founder, the move greatly enhanced the utility of the protocol.\n\nSays Urbach,\n\n\u201cMoving Render\u2019s core infrastructure to Solana is a watershed moment that unlocks major new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase, it will be supporting both the Solana and Ethereum versions of the asset, noting that the tokens have slightly different names across blockchains.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will support trading of the Render token on both Ethereum and Solana networks. Render on the Ethereum network will retain the ticker RNDR while Render on Solana will have the ticker RENDER and will be named Render (Solana) on our trading platform.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum: This is how this blockchain skyrocketed DeFi's TVL! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Fri 16 Feb 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi) defines the total value of assets locked in DeFi protocols and smart contracts. In other words, it measures the total amount of cryptocurrencies locked and utilized in various decentralized financial services. These services include liquidity pools, borrowing and lending protocols, decentralized exchange platforms (DEXs), among others. TVL is often seen as an indicator of the popularity and adoption of different DeFi protocols. It acts as a barometer of this crypto ecosystem. Indeed, according to recent data, DeFi\u2019s TVL is at the peak of its form thanks to the dynamism of Ethereum. This article explains the ins and outs of this trend.\n\nDeFi at its Highest Level in 20 Months Thanks to Ethereum!\n\nDeFi is experiencing a robust resurgence, marked by a substantial increase in its total value locked (TVL). This is shown by recently published data by crypto platform DefiLlama. According to it, the DeFi\u2019s TVL has exceeded $69 billion, reaching its highest point in the last 20 months.\n\nThis resurgence is not limited to any specific blockchain, as various protocols from different networks contribute to the upward trend. Most notably is Ethereum. In just the past month, Ethereum\u2019s TVL has jumped an impressive 37 %, reaching about $41 billion at present.\n\nThis increase can be attributed to the influential role played by protocols such as EigenLayer, which have contributed to a significant influx on the Ethereum network. Concurrently, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto, Ether (ETH), has witnessed a remarkable rise, with bullish sentiments aiming for the $3,000 mark as the next target. A spike that coincides with the announcement by Franklin Templeton of its plans to launch an Ethereum Spot ETF, reinforcing the positive trend prevailing in the market. But then, what are the blockchains that are positively impacting DeFi\u2019s TVL, besides Ethereum?\n\nThe Key Role of Solana and Arbitrum in DeFi\u2019s TVL Rise\n\nAccording to data, Solana and Arbitrum have played a major role in increasing DeFi\u2019s TVL by attracting significant attention and substantial investment flows.\n\nIn February, for example, Solana experienced a remarkable increase in its TVL, which reached $1.90 billion. It\u2019s Solana\u2019s highest TVL since mid-2022. This increase follows a substantial upward trajectory. Solana\u2019s TVL soared by 47 % in the month of January alone and over 500 % since October 2023.\n\nThe dynamism can be credited to platforms like Jupiter, Kamino, and Jito. They are indeed the key catalysts that have attracted considerable capital into the Solana ecosystem. Not to mention, the phenomenon of airdrops has triggered fervor within the crypto community, further consolidating the inflow of funds into Solana-based projects.\n\nSimilarly, Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution designed for Ethereum, has seen a notable rise in its TVL. It reached a record level of $2.9 billion. This increase is attributed to the involvement of key protocols such as GMX, Hyperliquid, and Camelot, which have significantly contributed to Arbitrum\u2019s growth.\n\nThe simultaneous rise of Solana and Arbitrum underscores the increasing importance of level 1 and 2 solutions in the crypto landscape. Indeed, these platforms not only offer scalability solutions but also provide a fertile ground for the development of innovative projects and decentralized applications (dApps). Interestingly, even the Bitcoin network has played a role in the increase of DeFi\u2019s TVL.\n\nThe Unexpected Contribution of Bitcoin to the Surge in DeFi\u2019s TVL\n\nTraditionally, the Bitcoin network is not associated with decentralized finance. However, its influence on the recent dynamism of DeFi\u2019s TVL is noted by experts. Over the past month, the TVL of Bitcoin-based DeFi has experienced a remarkable increase, reaching $927.5 million. This represents an impressive rise of 182.9 %. An increase attributed to the emergence and adoption of protocols such as Merlins Seal, Lightning Network and Thorchain.\n\nThe expansion of DeFi\u2019s TVL across various blockchain networks highlights something significant. Namely, that this segment of crypto is experiencing sustained evolution, marked by a transition towards a multi-chain paradigm. This development underlines the growing importance of interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem and indicates the broader acceptance and integration of DeFi principles.\n\nFurthermore, the remarkable growth of DeFi\u2019s TVL across the Bitcoin network is revealing of the burgeoning relevance of BTC. This goes beyond its role as a store of value or means of exchange. While it is commonly regarded as an autonomous crypto, the integration of BTC into DeFi highlights its versatility and adaptability within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, the success of Bitcoin-based DeFi protocols signals a paradigm shift in the perceived utility of the leading crypto. BTC is no longer just seen as a digital currency. It is now recognized as a viable platform for decentralized financial applications. This contributes to the diversification and expansion of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, analyzing the dynamism of Ethereum and its impact on DeFi\u2019s TVL reveals a positive evolution in the crypto ecosystem. The recent increase in TVL, marked by the essential contribution of Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum and even the Bitcoin network, demonstrates the emergence of a multi-chain paradigm in decentralized finance. The increasing integration of Bitcoin into DeFi also underlines its versatility and relevance beyond its traditional role. This phenomenon sheds new light on the perception of the Bitcoin blockchain as a viable platform for decentralized financial applications, which serves to contribute to the diversification and expansion of the DeFi ecosystem in its entirety.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gaming community, as well as Ethereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB) whales, are now directing their attention towards novel cryptocurrencies.\n\nDeeStream (DST) emerged as a blockchain project poised to revolutionize the live streaming industry. They perceive it as having the potential to experience a significant surge in value. This article delves into the reasons behind this growing interest and exploration of DeeStream (DST).\n\nSupporters of DeeStream (DST) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nEthereum (ETH) to continue a bullish run?\n\nEthereum (ETH) recently concluded a bullish rally, experiencing an approximately 11% surge from $2361 to $2631 over the past week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis rally has contributed to Ethereum's notable performance, further evidenced by a substantial increase in trading volume, nearly doubling recently. The surge in volume signals investor confidence in the sustainability of this bullish trend.\n\nBinance (BNB) facing regulatory challenges\n\nDespite a modest over 6% increase in the past month, with prices rising from $303.94 to $323.22, Binance Coin (BNB) appears disconnected from the ongoing crypto rally, reflected in its relatively low uptick in trading volume compared to Ethereum (ETH). This divergence suggests that Binance\u2019s (BNB) gains may not be attributed to the broader market rally.\n\nThese developments occur against the backdrop of Binance (BNB) facing regulatory challenges and the recent criminal sentencing of its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The impact of these events is palpable in the market, as evidenced by Binance's (BNB) recent displacement from its market capitalization position by Solana (SOL).\n\nDeeStream (DST) welcomes new supporters\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB) whales are turning their attention towards the presale of DeeStream (DST), a novel decentralized streaming platform poised to disrupt the industry. Unlike centralized platforms like Kick and Twitch, DeeStream (DST) offers a decentralized model that empowers token holders through its governance system. As the live-streaming market is projected to soar to a valuation of $247 billion by 2027, DeeStream (DST) holds a significant first-mover advantage in this burgeoning sector.\n\nStreamers can seamlessly join the platform by completing a straightforward registration process and sharing their channel link with fans. In addition to earning revenue through Dee gifts, subscriptions, and packages, streamers benefit from fan engagement, while fans can participate in reward programs and earn cryptocurrency by completing tasks and reaching milestones. Moreover, the platform offers a swap service enabling users to exchange various cryptocurrencies with zero commission charges, facilitating seamless transactions globally.\n\nInvestors keen on participating in the presale , currently underway for just $0.035."

        "title": "XRP Army Applauds: SEC Nears End Of 'ETH Gate' Investigation - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly concluding its investigation into allegations of conflict of interest within its ranks, particularly concerning the regulation of Ethereum (ETH). The investigation, dubbed \u2018ETH Gate,\u2019 has garnered widespread attention, especially from the XRP community, which has long criticized the SEC\u2019s approach to crypto regulation.\n\nETH Gate Investigation In \u2018Final Stages\u2019\n\nTristan Leavitt, President of the government watchdog group Empower Oversight, shared critical updates on X (formerly Twitter) regarding the SEC\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) nearing the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of its inquiry. This investigation was initiated following Empower Oversight\u2019s referral to the OIG in May 2022, highlighting potential financial conflicts of interest by SEC officials in cryptocurrency-related decisions.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 The SEC has disclosed to @EMPOWR_us that the SEC OIG is in the \"final stages\" of an investigation into the cryptocurrency-related financial conflicts of interest Empower referred to the OIG in May 2022. https://t.co/IuYfNAsYXb\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Tristan Leavitt (@tristanleavitt) February 15, 2024\n\nA focal point of controversy involves William Hinman, former Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance, who, despite financial ties to the law firm Simpson Thacher\u2014a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance\u2014played a pivotal role in guiding the SEC\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies. Hinman\u2019s 2018 declaration that Ether was not considered a security by the SEC raised eyebrows, given his undisclosed financial interest and the subsequent rise in Ether\u2019s value.\n\nEmpower Oversight\u2019s FOIA efforts unveiled that Hinman had consulted with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin of Consensys before his infamous \u201cHinman speech,\u201d despite guidelines to avoid such engagements. \u201cSimpson Thacher is a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Its cryptocurrency, Ether, is a competitor with others like Bitcoin and Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP. So Hinman clearly shouldn\u2019t have been helping guide the SEC\u2019s enforcement decisions on cryptocurrencies,\u201d Leavitt highlighted.\n\nThe president of the government watchdog also expressed his combativeness and declared that Empower is ready to sue the SEC if it doesn\u2019t begin producing the documents by February 23. \u201cThe American people deserve transparency. The silver lining is that now we know one reason for the stonewalling [\u2026] However, whether the OIG report thoroughly addresses all the issues we raised remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nOn the implication for a potential spot Ethereum ETF, Leavitt answered, \u201cUnclear. We don\u2019t know the scope of their investigation yet\u2026 but we are in the process of finding out.\u201d\n\nXRP Army Reacts\n\nThe issue has gained considerable attention in the documentary \u201cXRP Unleashed\u201d by Fruition Films, where legal expert John E. Deaton criticized the scenario as \u201cregulatory capture 101.\u201d Reflecting on the documentary\u2019s insights, Deaton emphasized today:\n\nWe must have our ethics\u2019 rules followed, and when they\u2019re not, they must be enforced. America is at its greatest when we have a level playing field and we allow the best technologies and innovations to compete fairly. And we must ALWAYS stand up against gross government overreach.\n\nThe XRP community\u2019s reaction has been one of cautious optimism. Influential XRP influencer Mr. Intuitive (@BlackberryXRP) remarked, \u201cLast week: ETHgate is dead nothing will happen. This week: Investigation results coming soon.\u201d This sentiment underscores the shifting perceptions around the investigation\u2019s impact and growing attention.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, known as \u201cETH whistleblower\u201d who is currently preparing a fraud lawsuit against Ethereum\u2019s founders, echoed a defiant tone: \u201cI keep saying they will NOT bury this & we will expose them. I beat the SEC, DOJ, FBI & more. Unprecedented. I never doubted I\u2019d win. Why? I never let them get into my head & I exposed their weaknesses. Don\u2019t underestimate them or think they\u2019re invincible. They\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nAs the SEC nears the conclusion of its \u2018ETH Gate\u2019 investigation, the crypto community remains vigilant, hopeful for outcomes that could foster greater transparency, ethics, and fairness in the regulatory landscape. The final report by the OIG is eagerly anticipated, with potential far-reaching effects on the future of crypto regulation and enforcement.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.56954.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

The purpose of this program is to encourage and support research activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn the previous funding round which was in 2023, the Foundation was successful, funding 43 projects from 20 different countries.\n\nThe foundation garnered an impressive 250 applications, signaling a huge worldwide interest for Ethereum research.\n\nLeveraging this momentum, the foundation extends its invitation to an even broader array of researchers and institutions from across the globe to partake in this grants round.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization that supports the development and growth of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform.\n\nEstablished in 2014, the foundation is not a company or a traditional non-profit, but rather a coordinating force that fosters the Ethereum ecosystem without controlling it.\n\nThe EF was initially funded by an online public crowd sale in 2014, where participants bought Ether (ETH) with Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s initiatives include the Ecosystem Support Program, which provides both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the Ethereum community.\n\nThe foundation also organizes the annual Devcon conference for Ethereum developers, researchers, thinkers, and makers.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Foundation Fellowship Program aims to address gaps in representation across cultures, nationalities, and economic classes.\n\nAs of April 2023, the Ethereum Foundation owns approximately 0.297% of the total Ether supply, which is approximately 350,000 ETH. The foundation also owns $300 million in non-crypto assets, mainly held in fiat currencies.\n\nIt is led by the leadership of an executive board consisting of Aya Miyaguchi, Vitalik Buterin, and Patrick Storchenegger.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, the total funds allocated for the initiative are $1 million. While the application is open, the deadline is set for 23:59 UTC on March 4th, 2024. Furthermore, it expresses particular interest in a diverse range of domains, encompassing applied and theoretical cryptography, economics, game theory, security, consensus protocols, formal verification, peer-to-peer networking, society and regulation, and hardware.\n\nOther details provided include that applications must be in English and submitted in PDF format. Proposals should comprise a detailed description, budget, and timeline for the proposed scope of work. An applicant profile, along with a public repository or link to published work, is required. Additionally, projects must produce formal academic research. Research output must be open-access with a free and permissive license.\n\nRestricted projects include anything illegal in the local jurisdiction, financial products and services (trading platforms, investment products, stablecoins, lending or betting platforms), art or social impact projects not aligned with this round\u2019s scope, projects seeking retroactive funding, and those planning token launches or public funding rounds.\n\nFunding decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the impact of the proposed research, the research team\u2019s experience, and the clarity of the proposal."

Its market value exceeded $1 trillion, marking a significant achievement not witnessed since November 2021. A firm close above $52,700 is expected to open the door for a potential climb to $60,000 and beyond. If this trend persists, Bitcoin is likely to surpass its previous all-time high of $69,000 very soon.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cBitcoin hits $52.5k as any doubts that bears had for a return from the $50k mark were shattered because of significant buying interest from institutional investors. Blackrock alone now holds more than 100,000 BTC. The next resistance for BTC is however not very far away and a small retracement can be expected around the $53k mark. ETH (+6%) on the other hand also broke past $2.8k as it went back to May 2022 levels. Ethereum is currently in high demand from staking and re-staking derivatives in the market. If ETH and BTC do not see a heavy correction, an altcoin season might be on the cards as we approach the bitcoin halving in April.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin surged to $52,000, reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap after 26 months, hinting at further gains. Despite a Tuesday dip below $50,000 on U.S. inflation data, BTC bounced back. The rally pushed BTC's market value past $1 trillion for the first time since Dec. 2021, rising 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 6%, while Ethereum (ETH) reached $2,750, its highest since May 2022. Bullish sentiment persists, targeting $75,000, fueled by robust inflows into U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs, including BlackRock's IBIT. Analysts foresee BTC's uptrend with a key support level of $46,000 but caution about slowing momentum.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's rally above $50,000 this week saw most long-term holders profit, despite the recent market decline following the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Glassnode's analysis suggests that this decline was a typical bull market correction. Long-term holders are selling their coins, partly due to the ETF craze and the outflow of Bitcoin Trust in the grayscale. However, newer bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity and others have attracted over $10 billion, offsetting the selling pressure. With less than 13% of total supply still in the red and strong trading volumes for new ETFs, the worst of Grayscale's selloff may be behind us.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe Total Crypto Market has increased by 5% from the last day to $1.95 trillion, fueled by a new Bitcoin all-time high (ATH) again for this year. The market optimism around Bitcoin halving continues as Bitcoin has regained a $1 trillion market cap above $52,000 and is just 30% away from ATH. One event investors should pay close attention to is the recent Genesis court approval to redeem its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings valued at $1.3 billion and potential impacts on the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cThe crypto market continues to rise, with Bitcoin and Ethereum hitting their highest points of the year. This growth is fueled by increased investments in Bitcoin spot ETFs and positive sentiment about the upcoming halving event. For Bitcoin to keep climbing, it needs to close above $52,000. Likewise, Ethereum aims to break the $2,900 barrier on its way to $3,300. Alts have also started showing strength, tokens like STX and IMX have surged by over 25% in just a few days.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

It serves its role as just a cryptocurrency, earning high esteem among crypto enthusiasts for its significant worth and the distinct investment opportunities it offers. Recently, Ethereum has gained spotlight following spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. In 2023, while the US crypto market was focused on Bitcoin ETFs, Blackrock\u2019s proposal for an Ethereum-based ETF shifted the spotlight to Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. This shift, alongside a positive market trend and a crypto rally in late October, helped Ethereum\u2019s value surpass $2,000, a significant milestone it hadn\u2019t reached in months. Ethereum\u2019s rise was further triggered after the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, leading to a peak in Ethereum\u2019s value in nearly two years by January 12. Looking ahead, Ethereum is set for notable upgrades with the upcoming Deneb and Cancun updates. The Dencun upgrade is particularly significant, introducing proto-danksharding to improve network scalability, reduce gas fees for users, and enhance interoperability with other blockchains, paving the way for more efficient cross-chain interactions. Amid all these, our Ethereum price prediction aims to explore the future trend of ETH price with in-depth technical analysis to offer profitable investment opportunities. Looking for crypto with more potential than Ethereum? Explore our guide to the best crypto to buy now.\n\nEthereum And Its Use Cases\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015, revolutionized blockchain technology by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) beyond just supporting cryptocurrencies. It introduced its native coin, Ether (commonly referred to as Ethereum or ETH), which is used for transactions on the blockchain. [ccpw id=60480] can be traded, staked for blockchain contributions, and was initially part of a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, where complex computations added blocks to the blockchain. However, this system was environmentally costly, using more energy annually than Kazakhstan, and led to slow, congested transactions.\n\nAnd we finalized!\n\n\n\nHappy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nTo address these issues, [ccpw id=60480] transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in 2020, allowing holders to add blocks based on their ETH holdings. This shift, known as The Merge, was completed on September 15, 2022, making the network more efficient and environmentally friendly.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Hype And Current Status\n\nCurrently, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs operational, the crypto community is speculating about the potential approval and timing of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the situation is complex. The SEC has not clarified if ether qualifies as a security, a determination that could impede an ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was contentious, narrowly passing with a one-vote margin, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s vote. Gensler emphasized that this approval does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin by the SEC and should not be interpreted as openness to approving crypto asset securities in general.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nThese factors, among others, have led to mixed opinions about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved soon. While banks generally view such approval as improbable, crypto experts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook.\n\nProponents expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval this year draw parallels to the recent approval process of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMatt Kunke, a research analyst at the crypto market making firm GSR, predicts a 75% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in May. His optimism is based on Grayscale\u2019s Court of Appeals victory and the subsequent green light for Ethereum Futures ETF. He believes these developments indicate that a spot Ethereum ETF approval is imminent.\n\nKunke also noted that if the SEC rejects the current spot Ethereum ETF applications in May, an appeal is likely to follow. In such a scenario, he suggests that the SEC might choose the easier route of approval, while still maintaining a cautious approach towards other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC has recently postponed Grayscale Investments\u2019 request to transform its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This decision came just a day after the SEC similarly deferred BlackRock\u2019s application for a comparable ETF proposal.\n\nMarket sentiment has shown a degree of optimism regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETF by May 23, the deadline set by the SEC for the Ark 21Shares application. However, according to JPMorgan (JPM), the likelihood of the SEC granting approval for the ETF by this date is estimated to be no higher than 50%.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Price History\n\n[ccpw id=60480] price history has seen significant fluctuations. Launching at around $2.77 in 2015, it surpassed $10 in 2016 but faced setbacks due to a hack. In 2017, it crossed $100 and briefly went over $1,000 in early 2018 during a crypto bubble, then stabilized around $300 for the next three years.\n\nIn early 2021, Ethereum\u2019s price surged, nearly reaching $4,000 in May. Despite a summer dip, it rebounded, partly driven by the NFT craze. [ccpw id=60480] hit a record high of $4,891.70 in November as [ccpw id=60415] also soared.\n\n2022 was challenging for crypto, with Ethereum nearly falling below $1,000 despite the successful completion of The Merge.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum saw a period of recovery, surpassing the $2,000 mark in April for the first time in almost a year. However, it experienced a downturn in early June, dropping to $1,624.14 by June 15. The market then rebounded, and following a decision that Ripple\u2019s XRP was not a security on exchanges, Ethereum peaked at $2,026.20 on July 14.\n\nBy December 9, Ethereum\u2019s value climbed to $2,401.76, the highest since May 2022. On December 13, it was trading around $2,180. The price peaked again at $2,445.02 on December 28, before closing the year at $2,281.47. However, Ethereum started this year on a bearish note as spot Bitcoin ETF approval triggered a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event in the market, plunging ETH price toward the $2,100 level.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Technical Analysis\n\nEther gained momentum after it surpassed the $2,400 resistance level, showcasing strong buying interest from investors. Over the last few hours, ETH price faced strong buying pressure near the $2,700 level and knocked the $2,830 level; however, it faced resistance from the bears. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,802, surging over 1.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nInvestors are currently attempting to hold the price beyond the $2,800 resistance, indicating a continuation of the upward trend. Should the buyers maintain the upward trend above immediate Fib channels, the ETH/USDT pair might surge to the key $3,000 mark. At this level, short-term traders could begin to take profits and trigger a correction.\n\nThe pressure is increasing on the bears. To plunge the bullish momentum, they must lower and keep the price under the EMA20 trend line. If successful, the pair could retreat to the $2,600 level and might prepare for a retest of the $2,400 level. However, this support zone will likely attract buyers to accumulate more ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction By Blockchain Reporter\n\nYears Minimum ($) Average ($) Maximum ($) 2024 1,336.16 2,802.23 3,694.71 2025 4,724.31 4,851.80 5,044.96 2026 6,432.54 6,864.13 7,024.51 2027 8,436.93 8,610.28 9,225.42 2028 7,356.01 7,853.56 8,372.82 2029 10,476.50 11,116.55 11,267.95 2030 14,884.16 15,434.11 15,892.40 2031 21,468.24 21,708.27 23,002.47 2032 30,257.37 30,703.18 31,393.21 2033 41,282.84 42,125.08 42,202.84\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024\n\nIn 2024, the price of 1 Ethereum is expected to attain a minimum level of $1,336.16.

By the year\u2019s end, it is projected that Ethereum will achieve a minimum value of $41,282.84. Furthermore, there is potential for the ETH price to attain a maximum of $42,202.84.\n\nMonths Minimum ($) Average ($) Maximum ($) January $41,245.82 $42,007.91 $42,497.92 February $41,246.33 $42,161.73 $42,302.38 March $41,297.03 $41,378.26 $41,765.65 April $41,267.28 $41,400.21 $41,485.31 May $41,319.28 $41,392.19 $41,490.75 June $41,300.92 $42,302.38 $42,936.63 July $41,344.06 $42,514.19 $42,719.22 August $41,244.98 $42,425.09 $42,899.07 September $41,311.39 $41,376.66 $42,313.83 October $41,319.64 $42,527.33 $42,649.53 November $41,307.98 $42,248.30 $42,560.79 December $41,282.84 $42,125.08 $42,202.84\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: By Experts\n\nAccording to the Ethereum price prediction by Coincodex, it is forecasted that Ethereum\u2019s value will increase by 7.61%, reaching $2,394.45 by January 31, 2024. The technical indicators used by Coincodex suggest a current Bearish sentiment, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a Neutral stance at 49. In the past 30 days, Ethereum has experienced 40% green days, showing a 5.25% price volatility.\n\nCoincodex\u2019s analysis currently advises against purchasing Ethereum. Their forecast, considering historical price trends of Ethereum and Bitcoin halving cycles, estimates the yearly low for Ethereum in 2025 to be around $2,161.48. However, they also predict that Ethereum\u2019s price could soar up to $6,389.27 in the following year.\n\nVanEck, a prominent global investment fund house, holds a bullish stance on Ethereum, viewing it as a \u201ctriple-point asset\u201d that serves as a capital asset, a consumer asset, and a store of value. VanEck believes that, under favorable conditions, Ethereum\u2019s market cap could surpass $2 trillion.\n\nBen Ritchie, the managing director of Digital Capital Management, forecasts that Ethereum could potentially end the year at around $2,500, provided positive developments continue.\n\nWell-known cryptocurrency blogs such as Gov Capital and Traders Union also share a bullish outlook on Ethereum. Gov Capital predicts Ethereum\u2019s value could reach $7,200 by 2025. Anton Kharitonov, an analyst at Traders Union, anticipates that Ethereum could be trading at about $6,196.08 by the end of 2025, with the potential to increase to $31,656.34 by 2030.\n\nIs Ethereum A Good Investment? When To Buy?\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s future performance is challenging. The cryptocurrency has shown strong buying confidence, recovering well from the news of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. Additionally, Ethereum is progressing with new upgrades and there\u2019s rising speculation about a potential spot Ethereum ETF, which has positively influenced its price.\n\nHowever, the much-anticipated Merge, expected to significantly enhance Ethereum, did not have a substantial impact on its price. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also means that Ethereum\u2019s value could decrease at any moment. It\u2019s noteworthy that Bitcoin\u2019s value declined following the approval of its spot ETFs last week.\n\nConversely, the increasing amount of Ethereum being staked indicates that The Merge has been technically successful and well-received in the community. It is suggested to invest in ETH at a price of $1,800-$1,900 for a solid return in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, renowned as a technologically advanced and established cryptocurrency, is poised to maintain its leading position in the altcoin market in the upcoming years, as indicated by the aforementioned Ethereum price prediction. Differing from Bitcoin, Ethereum functions as a utility token. While its price is significantly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s movements and broader macroeconomic factors, Ethereum\u2019s value is also affected by a variety of crypto-specific elements.\n\nAdditionally, the trends in cryptocurrency and equity markets typically exhibit parallel movements. However, over the past year, these markets have shown a divergence. For instance, numerous tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL) have reached all-time highs, while the cryptocurrency sector continues to experience a bear market.\n\nRecent improvements in macroeconomic conditions, like the slowdown in inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s pause on interest rate hikes, have not led to a corresponding positive impact on cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum. This raises questions about the factors influencing the crypto market\u2019s reaction to these economic changes.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is a blockchain platform that introduced Ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency used for transactions on its network. Launched in 2015, Ethereum is notable for enabling decentralized applications (DApps) and transitioning to a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system.\n\nWhat are Ethereum ETFs and their current status? Ethereum ETFs are proposed exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum. The current status is uncertain, as the SEC has not yet approved any Ethereum ETFs, and their potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s value and the broader crypto market is a subject of speculation.\n\nWhat factors could influence Ethereum\u2019s price in the future? Ethereum\u2019s price could be influenced by various factors including market trends, technological upgrades like Deneb and Cancun, regulatory decisions, the outcome of Ethereum ETFs, and overall investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market."

        "title": "700% Gains Coming? Why Some See Ethereum ETH Price Hitting $20,000 Eventually - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ether price crossed $2,800 on February 15th for the first time since early 2022, nearing its historic peak above $4,900 reached in late 2021.\n\nThe recent rally has been driven by a confluence of factors \u2013 anticipation of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the US, increasing levels of staking participation locking up circulating supply, and overall positive market sentiment.\n\nTLDR\n\nEther (ETH) price breaks above $2,700 on Feb 15, 2024 for the first time since May 2022 as traders anticipate potential approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US\n\nSeveral major financial firms like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Ark Invest have filed for a spot ETH ETF which could significantly boost institutional demand\n\n25% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply is now locked in the ETH 2.0 staking contracts as investors deposit more ETH to earn staking rewards of ~4% per year\n\nOver 943,000 validators are now active on the Ethereum Beacon Chain as staking participation continues to increase, improving network security\n\nAnalysts predict ETH price could rapidly approach its all-time high around $5,000 if bullish momentum continues, with $3,500 as a key medium-term target\n\nSeveral major financial services firms like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock and Ark Invest have already secured regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2023.\n\nThey are now racing to launch the first spot ETH ETF, which would open the floodgates for trillions in institutional capital to invest directly into the asset.\n\nThe SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs helped propel BTC price over $50k this year. Market participants expect a similar impact on ETH prices if spot ETH ETFs get the green light.\n\nIn parallel, staking participation on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain continues to steadily rise. 25% of the total circulating supply of ETH is now locked up in staking deposits, reducing sell-side pressure.\n\nOver 943,000 validators are actively participating in the consensus process on Ethereum as it transitions to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nValidators earn ~4% annual yield as rewards for their capital locked up as collateral, creating a passive income stream that has boosted participation.\n\nAs staking levels increase, so does the security of the chain making 51% attacks virtually impossible due to the cost associated with obtaining such a large chunk of ETH supply.\n\nETH\u2019s pivot to proof-of-stake is also environmentally sustainable, in line with institutional investors and funds growing focus on ESG mandates. This makes it likely the SEC greenlights spot Ether ETFs.\n\nWith consoldiation around the $2,800 levels, analysts say ETH looks poised to challenge its historic peak around $5,000 later in 2024.\n\nKey target levels on the way up are $3,500 which was the April 2022 top, and $4,200 which marked the pre-crypto winter peak in November 2022.\n\nContinued spikes in staking deposits locking up ETH supply, approval of spot ETH ETFs allowing new institutional capital inflows, as well as broader crypto bull run returning could be the perfect storm that sees Ether trade firmly into 5 digits for the first time ever."

        "title": "Comparing Solutions of 2 Crypto Giants: Lightning Network vs Ethereum 2.0 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The crypto market is steadily gaining momentum. Now investors\u2019 focus shifts towards the market leaders \u2014 Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, these networks didn\u2019t age well regarding scalability. Both BTC and ETH experience high gas fees and network congestion in times of high traffic.\n\nTheir developer communities remain highly active and are pushing out scaling solutions to solve these issues. The Lighting Network attempts to scale payments and allow users to send BTC quickly. Ethereum\u2019s recent upgrade to 2.0 introduced proof of stake and opened the path to sharding.\n\nIn this article, we explore these solutions in detail and assess whether swapping ETH to BTC is a good idea.\n\nExploring Lightning Network\n\nThe LN is a scaling solution for Bitcoin that Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja introduced in 2016. The idea behind it is to provide users with a solution to use BTC as a form of payment instead of a store of value.\n\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s architecture, the network remains purposefully slow for security reasons. However, the limited number of tps (~7 tps) prevents users from using BTC for daily payments or microtransactions. As a result, holders prefer to hoard Bitcoin instead of spending it.\n\nThe Lightning Network acts as a second layer to the Bitcoin network. Users can execute transactions at a much larger scale and for much cheaper than on the underlying network. Theoretically, LN aims to achieve 1 million tps, rivaling any digital payment system available.\n\nExploring Ethereum 2.0\n\nUntil 2022, Ethereum used a PoW algorithm similar to Bitcoin\u2019s for confirming transactions. As a smart contract blockchain, the model quickly showed its limitations. Gas fees skyrocketed and transactions were ground to a halt during high activity on the chain.\n\nDevelopers implemented Ethereum 2.0, a scaling solution that introduced PoS. While this didn\u2019t improve the cost and speed of transactions, it alleviated the network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, the development team is pushing out another scaling solution called sharding. This would allow users to execute transactions on usage-specific sidechains. As a result, this could alleviate the strain on the underlying Ethereum blockchain while simultaneously conserving its security features.\n\nLightning Network vs Ethereum 2.0 Comparison\n\nWhat are the differences between these solutions? Are they as dissimilar as an ATOM vs LINK comparison? Sharding and LN both rely on the concept of sidechains with some crucial differences depicted below.\n\nScalability\n\nLightning Network aims to provide BTC users with affordable and near-instant transactions. The goal is to enable Bitcoin microtransactions for small payments.\n\nEthereum\u2019s sharding doesn\u2019t have a theoretical scaling limit. It depends on the number of sharded chains and the rollup model for confirming transactions on the relay blockchain.\n\nConsensus Mechanism\n\nThe Lightning Network doesn\u2019t use a consensus for transactions on the network. Instead, it opens payment channels between two parties. Once one of the parties chooses to close the payment channel, the protocol confirms the transactions on the blockchain.\n\nETH holders can stake their assets to participate in the consensus mechanism. These validators confirm the transactions where malicious actors can have their ETH destroyed.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe Lightning Network uses specific smart contracts. They rely on special signature states from the parties participating in the payment channel. The security and decentralization rely on the nodes in the LN.\n\nEthereum uses PoS, with a highly decentralized network and more than 800,000 validators.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nEthereum provides smart contract capability for deploying decentralized applications on its network. The Lightning Network, on the other hand, focuses on payments only.\n\nFinal Remarks on Lightning Network and Ethereum 2.0\n\nBoth the LN and Ethereum 2.0 are highly capable scaling solutions that improve upon BTC and ETH. They set the foundations for the mass adoption of these blockchains. Bitcoin can become a genuine payment vehicle, while Ethereum provides infrastructure for DeFi.\n\nImage by Miloslav Ham\u0159\u00edk from Pixabay"

        "title": "Is XRP Really Undervalued? Deep Dive Into the Price and Market Cap Potential - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nIs XRP Really Undervalued? Deep Dive Into the Price and Market Cap Potential\n\nStory Highlights Many believe XRP is currently priced lower than its potential, with some predicting a 957% surge if it matched Ethereum's market cap.\n\nXRP once challenged Ethereum, but legal issues and competition pushed it down to 6th place among crypto assets.\n\nAnalysts offer potential price projections if XRP rebounds, but uncertainties remain.\n\nXRP, currently battling to maintain the $0.57 mark, is considered by many as an undervalued token in the cryptocurrency market. The big question circulating: What if XRP could match Ethereum\u2019s substantial $299 billion market cap?\n\nXRP\u2019s Rise and Fall\n\nXRP once stood as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and held its position until Ethereum surged in 2016. The battle for supremacy continued until December 2017, when XRP\u2019s market cap soared to $95.8 billion, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $70 billion. Ethereum regained the second spot, and the battle continued until late 2019.\n\nThe SEC lawsuit in December 2020 cast a shadow, impacting XRP\u2019s standing. Despite Ethereum hitting $575 billion during the November 2021 bull run, XRP lagged at $60 billion. Now, it sits at the sixth spot among crypto assets, valued at $28.5 billion.\n\nLosing ground to Binance Coin (BNB), Tether (USDT), and Solana (SOL), XRP faces challenges. Formerly a rival to Ethereum, it now strives for relevance. Analysts speculate on a potential XRP comeback, but uncertainties persist.\n\nProjected XRP Prices\n\nIf XRP were to mirror Ethereum\u2019s market cap at $299 billion, each XRP coin could be valued at $5.53. A staggering 957% surge from its current $0.5727, this hypothetical price would rewrite the token\u2019s narrative, marking a new all-time high.\n\nDreaming big, if XRP reached a $1 trillion market cap like Bitcoin, its potential price could be around $18 per coin. A bold move, this scenario hints at substantial growth for the resilient token.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhile these projections are speculative, they fuel discussions about XRP\u2019s potential and its ability to reclaim a more prominent position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCan XRP rise again, reclaiming its historical glory, and find a lasting place in the crypto realm? Keep an eye on this space."
