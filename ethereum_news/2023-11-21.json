        "title": "Exploring Ethereum: a comprehensive look at ETH and its ecosystem - OKX",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered what Ethereum is and how it's different from other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\n\nEthereum is a decentralized network of computers worldwide that follows a set of rules known as the Ethereum protocol. This network serves as a platform for creating and using applications, communities, organizations, and digital assets, allowing anyone to do so without relying on a centralized power. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), pays for network activities, including the computation necessary to build and run decentralized apps (DApps) and organizations on Ethereum.\n\nThat's only scratching the surface about Ethereum, and in this article, we take a close look at the ecosystem, its native token, and how Ethereum is impacting the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nTL;DR\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows smart contracts and DApps with its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), used for transactions.\n\nETH, launched in 2015, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is essential for Ethereum network operations.\n\nEthereum's smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, facilitating automated, secure, and efficient transactions and applications without intermediaries.\n\nThe Merge has caused Ethereum to move to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which has significantly affected ETH issuance and energy consumption. This shift has had a massive impact on the network's sustainability and ETH's economic model.\n\nDespite challenges like competition from other blockchains, scalability issues, high transaction fees, regulatory risks, and security threats, Ethereum's future looks bright. This is due to numerous technological enhancements and advances in token standards.\n\nWhat's Ethereum and how does it differ from Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are fundamental cryptocurrencies that have helped accelerate the transformation of blockchain. However, the technologies are significantly different in their aim and operation. Ethereum uses blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, but also serves as a platform for DApps by applying smart contracts. These contracts are programmed to execute the conditions of an agreement automatically \u2014 an action that's directly included in the code.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, was created as a decentralized alternative to fiat currency. It aims to be a store of value and a medium of exchange. Blockchain technology creates a decentralized accounting ledger for Bitcoin transactions, removing the need for a single authoritative body.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum's blockchain is built to do even more. Through this platform, developers can build and launch various applications. This can be anything from video games to intricate financial systems. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is used to execute and manage transactions within this environment.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum has become a base for thousands of crypto token projects, each using the technology to power their own DApps.\n\nWhat ultimately separates Ethereum from Bitcoin is its technical basis. Ethereum has a faster block time than Bitcoin, meaning it can process transactions in less time. This is necessary for applications that demand rapid transaction speeds.\n\nFor many, the comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin is rooted in the distinction between their respective capabilities. Where Bitcoin is mainly a medium of exchange, Ethereum is more of a development platform with added features like smart contracts. This has resulted in a significant market cap for cryptocurrencies operating on decentralized blockchain technology.\n\nWhat is ETH?\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin created ETH, which has since become the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value behind Bitcoin. Unlike conventional currencies, ETH isn't regulated by any governing body. The token is a tradable asset class on multiple crypto exchanges.\n\nETH stands out in the crypto space because it's not just a medium of exchange or a store of value. ETH is used to run operations on the Ethereum network, such as executing smart contracts and DApps. To perform these processes, users must pay a fee in Ether, often called \"gas,\" given to miners to incentivize them to validate transactions on the blockchain.\n\nETH plays an essential part in the maturing DeFi environment, which aims to reproduce and modernize traditional financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without intermediaries. ETH is widely employed as collateral, a form of currency, and a unit of account in various economic protocols in DeFi.\n\nTraders and users hold ETH for various reasons: some \"hodl\" it long term, speculating on the growth of the Ethereum network and the broader adoption of blockchain technology. Others use it more actively for trading and accessing the network's capabilities.\n\nTo sum up, ETH is an essential component of the Ethereum network and the basis of the DeFi space.\n\nHow do Ethereum's smart contracts work?\n\nEthereum is renowned for its smart contracts. These contracts don't follow conventional guidelines. Instead, their terms are encoded into computer code. Smart contracts are located on the Ethereum blockchain, an open system that guarantees the underlying action or agreement will be carried out without disruption, control, deception, or outside influence.\n\nSmart contract functionality\n\nImagine a smart contract as a vending machine. When you choose a product (a digital deal or contract), you pay the necessary amount of ETH and the machine (the smart agreement) will instantly execute the deal in line with the encoded requirements. This system removes the need for intermediaries such as lawyers or brokers, which minimizes expenses and boosts effectiveness.\n\nThe power of automation in blockchain\n\nWhen the set parameters are fulfilled, smart contracts can autonomously enforce and complete the obligations of a deal. This way, these contracts can automate the administrative and transactional processes. This capability is game-changing in areas like finance, real estate, and legal operations, where complex agreements are common.\n\nDApps and beyond\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain serves as the base for various DApps. These applications are hosted on a peer-to-peer network instead of a single computer. The advantages of using DApps built on Ethereum are bolstered by blockchain technology's security, reliability, and transparency. From DeFi to NFTs, the range of applications is rapidly increasing.\n\nEthereum's smart contracts provide a reliable, clear, and efficient approach to supporting digital purchases and arrangements, creating change that could influence many industries positively.\n\nWhat are the real-world applications of Ethereum?\n\nEthereum's most notable use is in DeFi, which encompasses smart contract-powered loans and other financial activities. Ethereum stands out because of its decentralization, transparency, automation, and immutability, making it suitable for many different applications across various industries.\n\nBanking, crowdfunding, and web hosting are just some of the ways Ethereum has changed how people transact and interact. For example, Ethereum offers new ways of processing loans, borrowing, and trading digital assets.\n\nSmart contracts on Ethereum can be used to set up trustless and secure crowdfunding initiatives. At the same time, prediction markets employ the technology to create decentralized platforms for forecasting the results of events. Ethereum has also been used to create decentralized web services, spotlighting its influence in multiple domains.\n\nEthereum's blockchain technology supports various real-world applications across different industries, and several companies are actively leveraging its capabilities:\n\nTake-Two: In August 2023, the publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto gaming franchise announced the development of Sugartown, a Web3 game built on Ethereum. Sugartown's plot follows three agricultural animals that, by chance, open a wormhole from another world to Sugartown, allowing odd creatures known as Ora\u2019s to enter the city. Using their inventiveness, the Ora\u2019s turn Sugartown into a lively destination that offers enjoyable activities and amusements.\n\nING : The Dutch bank has been involved in multiple Ethereum-based projects. One example is Komgo, which aims to optimize trading documents. ING is also a part of Fnality, a payments settlement consortium, and has been working on Bamboo, a bilateral letter of credit.\n\nTD Ameritrade: As a brokerage firm, TD Ameritrade has embraced Ethereum by supporting ErisX, a CFTC-regulated spot exchange that leverages Ethereum smart contracts. What's more, the firm allows customers to trade Ethereum futures through the platform.\n\nThe above examples show how Ethereum's blockchain can enable secure, open, and effective trading of digital assets, the production of NFTs, and underpin a variety of financial activities.\n\nHow does Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake affect ETH?\n\nEthereum's shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), known as \"The Merge,\" has had a profound impact on the issuance and economics of ETH:\n\nPre-merge issuance:\n\nMiners issued ~13,000 ETH/day under PoW.\n\nAnnual inflation rate was approximately 4.61%.\n\nPost-merge issuance:\n\nIssuance reduced to validators issuing ~1,700 ETH/day under PoS.\n\nAnnual inflation rate now approximately 0.52%.\n\nTotal new ETH issuance down by ~88%.\n\nSustainability:\n\nThe Merge eliminated energy-intensive mining activities.\n\nValidators require a smaller reward, contributing to lower issuance.\n\nETH burning:\n\nTransactions require a base fee that gets burned, removing ETH from circulation.\n\nOn days of high network demand, the burning can offset the daily ETH issuance, potentially leading to deflation.\n\nValidator economics:\n\nValidators are incentivized to withdraw rewards over 32 ETH.\n\nWithdrawal limits are in place to maintain network stability.\n\nThe switch to PoS has significantly cut ETH's inflation rate and enhanced the blockchain's sustainability. The supply and demand for ETH is now affected by less issuance and the burning of transaction fees, which may sometimes result in net-zero inflation or deflation.\n\nWhat are the risks and challenges facing Ethereum and ETH?\n\nMany believe the risks and challenges that could affect Ethereum and ETH center on issues with functionality and value.\n\nCompetition from other blockchains\n\nNetworks like Solana and Cardano, which offer faster and cheaper transactions, are emerging as competitors that could potentially erode Ethereum's market share. However, one positive from increased competitive pressure is the potential for fresh innovation.\n\nScalability and storage\n\nAs Ethereum's blockchain increases, it's faced with scalability issues. The need for large storage capacity is growing faster than for Bitcoin. If this need is not managed effectively, it could result in the network exceeding the available resources which could cause problems with performance.\n\nHigh transaction fees\n\nEthereum's network can be too costly for transactions with little monetary value due to high fees. This could restrict its use to only those transactions with higher values, potentially impeding its day-to-day utility.\n\nRegulatory risks\n\nRegulations surrounding the DeFi and NFT segments running on Ethereum could change. If these segments are prohibited or limited in their use of Ethereum, it could diminish demand for transactions on the network.\n\nSecurity threats\n\nEthereum's layered architecture is susceptible to a variety of attacks:\n\nReplay attacks : hackers can copy and use transaction details again if crucial factors such as timestamps and nonces aren't handled correctly.\n\nFalse top-up attacks : errors in the confirmation process of tokens traded on platforms can result in the theft of possessions.\n\nHoneypot attacks : scam contracts that trick users into thinking they can steal ETH when in fact they lose it.\n\nShort URL attacks : bad input validation in exchanges can make transfer amounts look bigger than they are.\n\nAirdrop hunting attacks : these attacks involve the exploitation of airdrop functions to accumulate wealth illicitly.\n\nArbitrary storage writing attacks : the potential for attackers to change the data stored in smart contracts.\n\nGas exhaustion denial of service attacks: agreements that use up all the gas in a block, leaving no room for processing other transactions.\n\nWhat's the future outlook for Ethereum and ETH?\n\nA combination of market analysis, recent technological developments, and new innovations in token standards are shaping the future outlook for Ethereum and ETH.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nEthereum's price is predicted to hover between $1,800 and $1,900 throughout 2023, with resistance at $1,760 and potential dips to $1,600. The average trading price is expected to be around $1,880.75, and some analysts predict returns of around 5%. An ascending triangle technical trading setup indicates a bullish trend, suggesting Ethereum's rally could continue.\n\nBy November 2023, forecasts anticipate a value increase of 4.3%, reaching approximately $2,038.14. The market sentiment at November 2023 was neutral to bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a state of \"Greed.\"\n\nTechnological developments\n\nEthereum's transition from PoW to PoS with The Merge has reduced its energy consumption and improved security. Further upgrades, such as Danksharding, are expected to enhance Ethereum's scalability, speed, and efficiency, potentially strengthening its position in the crypto space.\n\nWith these technological advancements and a robust developer community, Ethereum is expected to sustain its growth and success.\n\nInnovation in token standards\n\nA notable innovation in 2023 is the introduction of ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts (TBA). This new Ethereum token standard significantly expands the functionality of NFTs, enabling them to act as their own smart contract accounts.\n\nThis overcomes the limitations of the previous ERC-721 standard by allowing for seamless interactions and improving the real-world usability of digital assets.\n\nEthscriptions\n\nEthscriptions are a new innovation on the Ethereum blockchain. They offer a way to share data \u2014 currently only images \u2014 without the need to create ERC-721 tokens. They differ from NFTs in their use of calldata for storage, lower creation and transfer costs, and their native hosting on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEthereum Follow Protocol (EFP)\n\nBrantly Millegan proposed the EFP in spring 2023. The protocol allows users to follow each other natively on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe vision is to build an essential social graph structure that's focused on Ethereum and can be incorporated with pre-existing platforms like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).\n\nEthereum's future looks encouraging, bolstered by positive market movements, regular upgrades to its technology, and the emergence of new token standards that should help improve the platform's usefulness and features.\n\nBecause of this, Ethereum has the potential to keep growing and become an even more significant player in the world of digital currencies. As with all projects and tokens, it's wise to continue researching and following updates to Ethereum to stay up to speed with its developments.\n\nThe final word\n\nEthereum stands out as an influential platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, powered by Ether (ETH).\n\nThe shift from PoW to PoS with the arrival of The Merge demonstrates Ethereum's dedication to progress and sustainability. This is seen in the network's growing scope of uses beyond transactions, paving the way for further DeFi innovation. Despite certain obstacles, such as scalability issues and rival protocols, Ethereum continues to push forward and find new users.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve with new technological advancements, its impact on the digital and financial landscape is poised to grow. What future do you envision for Ethereum in this rapidly changing ecosystem?"

        "title": "Crypto Started With Grand Dreams, Then Backroom Deals. Now It\u2019s Mired in Lawsuits - WIRED",
        "content": "Joel Dietz says crypto is rotten, and he\u2019s going to court to try to prove it. Dietz is a self-described \u201cfounding member\u201d of Ethereum, the computer network on which the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency is housed. He didn\u2019t pen the code, but in 2014, before Ethereum had launched, he worked as an evangelist of sorts, \u201cshowing people how it worked and why it was important,\u201d Dietz says. He received a batch of cryptocurrency in return.\n\nIn the early days, working in crypto felt like \u201cbuilding the future of the internet,\u201d says Dietz. It was about transparency, egalitarianism, and decentralization (crypto shorthand for transferring control over apps and infrastructure from the few to the many.) Dietz believed that open source\u2014the practice of making software code available for anyone to see, use, and riff upon\u2014could usher in this new dawn. \u201cBut things have gone offtrack from the original vision,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a rotting body here, and it smells.\u201d\n\nIn a state court in California, Dietz is suing former collaborator Aaron Davis for allegedly swindling him out of an ownership stake in MetaMask, an Ethereum-based crypto wallet, as part of the kind of \u201cseedy backroom deal,\u201d says Dietz, that has become \u201cendemic\u201d in crypto. Named as codefendants are Dan Finlay, with whom Davis publicly partnered on MetaMask; Consensys, the software company that owns the wallet; and Joe Lubin, Ethereum cofounder and Consensys CEO.\n\nIn a statement given to WIRED, Finlay dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d Dietz has been \u201cfalsely marketing himself\u201d as a founder to garner the respect of prospective investors, he said, but \u201chas no relation to MetaMask or any of its technology.\u201d\n\nDietz is certainly after financial compensation. In March of 2022, Consensys was valued at $7 billion, and MetaMask is among its most successful products. But, Dietz claims, the lawsuit is a small way of drawing attention to the state of crypto, which has been blighted by a series of legal battles, many of which boil down to an abuse of power or position. US regulators have filed civil charges against the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges\u2014among them Binance, Coinbase, and Gemini\u2014which are alleged to have either misled, mistreated, or endangered crypto investors. In July, Alex Mashinsky, founder of crypto lender Celsius, was charged by the US Department of Justice with \u201corchestrating a scheme to defraud customers.\u201d Earlier this month, Sam Bankman-Fried, once the golden boy of crypto, was found guilty of overseeing a multibillion-dollar fraud at his FTX exchange. In these cases, decentralization was a mirage.\n\n\u201cThe industry needs cleaning up,\u201d Dietz says. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\nMetaMask is a crypto wallet in the form of a web browser extension. It lets users hold crypto tokens compatible with Ethereum, of which there are thousands, and interact with software that runs on the network. Over time, it became a foundational piece of crypto infrastructure, used by more than 100 million people. Dietz says he came up with the idea."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nAccording to the latest data from 100eyes Crypto Scanner, Ethereum is approaching a horizontal support point at around $1,925.\n\nThis follows a dynamic 24-hour trading period where Ethereum's price fluctuated between $1,940.08 and $2,018.93, currently standing at $1,989.80.\n\nThis represents a 1.2% increase compared to the previous day, with its market capitalization now at approximately $239 billion and a substantial 24-hour trading volume of $23 billion.\n\nMore buying opportunities?\n\nHorizontal support is a significant concept in the trading of cryptocurrencies. It refers to a price level at which a downward trend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that Ethereum nears this key level of $1,925, investors and traders are closely monitoring its movement for potential buying opportunities or signs of a further price drop.\n\nThe top altcoin dropped in tandem with other major cryptocurrencies on Tuesday due to the bombshell Binance news.\n\nTraders are still greedy\n\nDespite this, Ethereum's current sentiment remains in 'greed' territory, with the Ethereum Fear and Greed Index indicating a score of 56 \u2014 suggesting that market sentiment is still optimistic.\n\nDespite recent fluctuations, ETH is up by 66% since the beginning of the year. This robust increase is a potential factor contributing to the prevailing optimistic sentiment among investors, even as the cryptocurrency approaches its horizontal support level.\n\nEthereum's performance over various periods has shown a mixed trend, with a 5-day decrease of 2.84% but an 11.34% rise over the past month and an 18.20% increase in the last three months."

        "content": "A new Ethereum layer-2 rollup, announced Monday, has already attracted $27 million in total value locked (TVL), but there\u2019s a twist: It doesn\u2019t yet exist.\n\nThe promised network, Blast, would launch as an optimistic rollup in February 2024, but its backers immediately began soliciting deposits into a smart contract \u201cbridge.\u201d\n\nIn the span of half a day, the contract has amassed enough ether (ETH) and dai (DAI) to put it at number 16 in rollup tracker L2Beat\u2019s TVL rankings, ahead of established names such as derivatives DEX Aevo and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nThe announcement touts Blast as \u201cthe only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins,\u201d meaning it taps into Ethereum staking yield by directing all ETH to Lido and uses DAI to tap MakerDAO\u2019s growing US Treasury bill yield through its Dai Savings Rate (DSR), currently at 5%.\n\nBlast\u2019s development team, led by pseudonymous Blur co-founder Pacman, raised $20 million from venture capital firms Paradigm and Standard Crypto, joined by a motley crew of angel investors and crypto influencers.\n\nEarly reaction has focused on the one-way nature of the \u201cbridge\u201d \u2014 once you cross you can\u2019t exit until after Blast actually launches and withdrawals are enabled.\n\nNormally, a bridge allows assets to flow both ways. This contract is apparently controlled by a five-key multi-signature wallet. However, of the five addresses, one contains no ether and has no transaction history, and the other four were recently funded by a single address.\n\nThat calls into question the independence of the signing cohort.\n\nAccording to Pacman, there\u2019s no need to worry.\n\n\u201cThe Blast Early Access bridge contract does use a multisig, and each signer is a unique contributor to Blast,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cThis is the same security model that other L2s like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum utilize \u2014 these L2s are all upgradeable via multisig as well.\u201d\n\nBlockworks also contacted Paradigm and Standard Crypto for comment.\n\nL2Beat designated the project \u201cupcoming\u201d rather than \u201cactive\u201d as a result of its current implementation.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe use of Lido has drawn the ire of Ethereum community members concerned with centralization risk in staking providers, including Dankrad Feist, who called it \u201ca very bad idea\u201d on X.\n\n\u201cETH and liquid staking derivatives are different assets with different risk profiles (and rewards), and users should have a choice about which one they want to use,\u201d he said.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, given that Paradigm is an investor in both Lido and Blur.\n\nCritics also question the use of a multi-level-marketing style referral campaign, which doles out points, of unknown value, to incentivize sending invitations to prospective new users.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe site explicitly promises an airdrop based on early access participation. Points earned are expected to be redeemable in May 2024.\n\nPoints systems have increasingly been used as a growth bootstrapping mechanism by protocol developers \u2014 including Pacman\u2019s prior marketing of Blur \u2014 and are widely seen as a precursor to an airdrop or something else of value.\n\nUpdated Nov. 21, 2024 at 12:15 pm ET with comment from Pacman and Nov. 22 at 5:57 am ET with additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "The newly launched Ethereum Layer 2 network, Blast has attracted significant attention on the announcement day with it recording nearly a $30 million inflow of bridged funds within hours.\n\nDespite not being able to withdraw bridged funds until the mainnet launch in February 2024, users are bridging funds to Blast with its TVL now reaching approximately $40 million, as per data from Etherscan.\n\nBlast is an optimistic rollup and it claims to be the first layer 2 network offering native yield on ETH and stablecoins including USDC, USDT, and DAI. It participates in ETH staking and gives back yields to users with additional rewards. It also introduces auto-rebasing stablecoin USDB to reward users with stablecoin yields.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more.\n\n\n\nDetails on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nThe novel L2 is currently live in the early access phase which can only be accessed via an invite code.

He shared plans to launch new NFT applications for Blur using Blast\u2019s tech and infrastructure.\n\nI will oversee the development of both @BLUR_io and @BLAST_L2.

        "title": "Cloudflare Blocks Abusive Content on its Ethereum Gateway - TorrentFreak",
        "content": "Cloudflare is a content-neutral Internet infrastructure service. The company aims not to interfere with the traffic of its clients and users but, in some cases, it has to take action. This means responding to DMCA subpoenas and takedown requests for hosted content, for example. In addition, Cloudflare now reports it has blocked access to 'abusive' content on its Ethereum gateway.\n\nOne of Cloudflare\u2019s main aims is to make the Internet more secure while respecting the privacy of its users.\n\nThis laudable goal is broadly respected but in common with other internet services, abuse of Cloudflare\u2019s services can lead to conflicting situations.\n\nThe California-based company previously terminated service to controversial sites including the Daily Stormer and Kiwi Farms. These actions were taken voluntarily, with Cloudflare citing an immediate threat to human life as the reason for the Kiwi Farms intervention.\n\nDomain Blocking\n\nIn addition to these rare events, the Internet infrastructure company is also subject to court orders from around the globe. In some cases, these orders require the company to block access to piracy-related domain names.\n\nCloudflare mentions these blocking orders in its latest transparency report which covers the second half of 2022. The report doesn\u2019t mention the number of court orders or blocked domains, but it confirms that Cloudflare complies with legitimate legal rulings.\n\n\u201cIf we determine that the order is valid and requires Cloudflare action, we may limit blocking of access to the content to those areas where it violates local law, a practice known as \u2018geo-blocking\u2019,\u201d Cloudflare writes.\n\nDNS Blocking\n\nDNS blocking orders apply locally and shouldn\u2019t affect people in other countries. However, things got more complicated recently when an Italian court required Cloudflare to restrict access to three torrent sites through its public DNS resolver 1.1.1.1.\n\nCloudflare fiercely objected to the order but ultimately lost the legal battle. That left the company with no other option than to take action. But, instead of blocking content through its global DNS resolver, it geo-blocked the domains for Italians.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that those websites used Cloudflare services, Cloudflare took steps following the issuance of the order to disable access to those websites for users in Italy or from Cloudflare equipment in Italy.\n\n\u201cCloudflare took action to geoblock all three domains that were addressed by the court\u2019s order and were using our service at the time the orders were issued via Cloudflare\u2019s pass-through CDN and security services,\u201d the company added.\n\nIPFS and Ethereum Restrictions\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Cloudflare further notes that it has implemented access restrictions on its public Ethereum gateway. The company doesn\u2019t store any content on the Ethereum network, nor can it remove any. However, it can block access through its service.\n\nIf Cloudflare receives valid abuse reports or copyright infringement complaints, it will take appropriate action. The same applies to the gateway for the decentralized IPFS network.\n\nIn its previous transparency report, Cloudflare already mentioned more than 1,000 IPFS actions a figure that increased slightly in the second half of last year. At the same time, Cloudflare also restricted access to 99 \u2018items\u2019 on the Ethereum network.\n\nSince these are \u2018gateway\u2019 related restrictions there\u2019s no impact on the content hosted on IPFS or Ethereum. Instead, it will only make it impossible to access content through Cloudflare\u2019s service.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many of these restrictions are abuse or copyright-related, as not much context is provided. The Ethereum actions are, at least in part, a response to the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s sanctions against the cryptocurrency tumbler Tornado Cash.\n\n\u201cThose sanctions raise significant legal questions about the extent to which particular computer software, rather than individuals or entities that use that software, can be subject to sanctions,\u201d Cloudflare writes.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, to comply with legal requirements, Cloudflare has taken steps to disable access through the Cloudflare-operated Ethereum Gateway to the digital currency addresses identified in the designation.\u201d\n\nDMCA Notices and Subpoenas\n\nThere are more obvious copyright responses as well. While Cloudflare generally doesn\u2019t block content in response to DMCA notices for customers that use its CDN services, it does remove infringing content permanently hosted on its servers.\n\nThese hosting services have expanded over the years and the same is true for the volume of valid DMCA notices received, up from 18 to 972 in the span of a year, as shown below. That\u2019s still a fairly modest number for a company with millions of customers.\n\nFinally, Cloudflare reports that the number of civil subpoenas, including those issued under the DMCA, has decreased. Rightsholders including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) typically use these requests to obtain identifying information about Cloudflare customers.\n\nIn the second half of last year, the company received 20 civil subpoenas which targeted 57 domain names. That\u2019s the lowest number since Cloudflare first disclosed this statistic five years ago, signaling a downward trend.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of Cloudflare\u2019s latest Transparency Report is available here (pdf)"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2023, Blast, a new second-layer solution on Ethereum (ETH), caused unprecedented hype on social media. By press time, over $87 million in liquidity is injected into this on-chain bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is Blast, novel Ethereum staking L2: Highlights\n\nBlast L2 protocol attempts to change the way Ether (ETH) is staked on-chain. It employs a number of eccentric mechanisms designed to offer more profitable and seamless staking for ETH holders.\n\nBlast is promoted as a second-layer protocol on top of Ethereum (ETH), the largest programmable blockchain.\n\nPer the statement of its team, Blast automatically stakes all injected crypto in Lido and redistributes staking rewards between investors if its L2.\n\nAlso, users who bridge stablecoins, automatically get USDB, Blast's auto-rebasing stablecoin, to enjoy additional yield from MakerDAO's on-chain T-bill protocol.\n\nBlast team will enable withdrawals on Feb. 24, 2024, while redemption of Blast Points is set to kick off in May.\n\nThe project siphoned over $87 million in Ether and stablecoins in less than 24 hours upon launch.\n\nImage by 21 Shares via Dune Analytics\n\nBy press time, its TVL metric demonstrates over 20,000% daily growth, which makes it arguably the fastest growing L2 in Ethereum (ETH) history.\n\nBlast, most overhyped Ethereum L2 in Q4, 2023\n\nBlast, a novel L2 on Ethereum, is attempting to make ETH staking more profitable via the concept of \"native yield.\"\n\nBlast L2: Basics\n\nBlast is the second-layer solution on the top of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. Per its official statement, Blast is developed by contributors of Blur, a dominant NFT marketplace. Also, it is said to be funded by heavyweight VCs Paradigm, Standard Crypto and Primitive Ventures with the participation of top angel investors Andrew Kang and Santiago Santos.\n\nSimply put, the protocol attempts to offer more inclusive and profitable staking for ETH and stablecoin holders than its competitors.\n\nWith Blast, ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2. Ether-denominated yield from an L1 staking protocol (initially Lido) is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nBlast attempts to integrate real-world assets into the ETH staking process. All of its customers who inject stablecoins get USDB, Blast's native asset. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO protocol pegged to U.S. 10-year T-bills.\n\nBlast L2: When will the token arrive?\n\nBlast released a three-step timeline for its operations:\n\nEarly access (already live from Nov. 21): Bridge goes live, Blast Points distribution starts. Mainnet launch (expected on Feb. 24, 2024): dApps go live, ETH withdrawals enabled by team. Redemption (expected in May 24, 2024): Blast Points redemption activated.\n\nUsers will only be able to withdraw what they inject into Blast three months after the start of its early access campaign.\n\nBlast Ethereum L2: Risks\n\nBesides the high volatility of cryptocurrency and other \"regular\" considerations necessary for crypto investors, there are some extra risks associated with the project so far:\n\nNobody can predict the price of Ether and associated assets on the day of the unlocking; the stakes-USD-denominated valuation can either spike or shrink.\n\nAirdrop of token is not guaranteed; its rules are also yet to be announced.\n\nInterest in building dApps on this L2 cannot be predicted.\n\nAs such, users should be extra cautious when working with every early-stage cryptocurrency protocol."

        "content": "Bitcoin price must hold above the critical support at $36,788 to keep hope for a continuation of the intermediate trend alive.\n\nThe $1,935 support level continues to hold for Ethereum price but the slump is likely to continue 5% lower.\n\nRipple price extends south, invalidating the bullish thesis with the potential for a further 8% slump to $0.5392.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains bearish, but there is hope, after the US Department of Justice may just have cleared the path for the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to some analysts, one of the stumbling blocks to the approval was the dominance of Binance exchange in the industry.\n\nLots of chatter on this Blackrock #Bitcoin ETF. And rightfully so. Blackrock more or less IS is the US government. They\u2019ve also received approval on 575/576 of ETF applications.\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say- there is no chance, and I mean zero, that this ETF is approved with Binance in\u2026 \u2014 Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) June 16, 2023\n\nAlso Read: With Binance market dominance under threat, experts say path for spot Bitcoin ETF is now clear\n\nBitcoin price tests key support\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is showing weakness, recording a 3% fall on the day, with most of these losses recorded following news around Binance exchange. Testing the critical support at $36,788 and with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing weakening momentum, BTC could fall.\n\nIncreased selling pressure below the $36,788 mean threshold of the supply zone stretching from $36,276 to $37,301 could open the drains for an extended fall, with experts anticipating a crash to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlready, the Awesome Oscillator\u2019s (AO) histogram bars are soaked in red and inching closer to the midline by the day. This points to the bears steadily taking over.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, increased buying pressure from investors looking to capitalize on the retest of $36,788 could send Bitcoin price north, first clearing the local top at $37,972 before testing the range high at $37,980 and ultimately claiming the $40,000 psychological level, 10% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price holds above critical support at $36,788 as Binance CEO CZ begins BTC halving countdown\n\nEthereum price struggles to keep $1,935 support base\n\nEthereum (ETH) price risks losing the critical support at $1,935, marking the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker that extend between $1,864 and $2,004. If the $1,935 level fails to hold, it could spell doom for token holders, with ETH likely sliding to the $1,800 psychological level, or in the dire case, invalidating the bullish thesis below $1,753.\n\nBoth the RSI and the AO support this outlook, edging south as momentum continues to fade.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased buying pressure, enough to vindicate Ethereum price from the grasp of the aforementioned supply barrier above $2,009 could spur optimism, setting ETH back above the ascending trendline. This could clear the skies for a stretch to $2,136, denoting a 10% ascent from the current level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price dilemma or buy signal before 60% rally"

        "content": "The global division of Spanish financial institution Banco Santander \u2013 Santander Private Banking International \u2013 has reportedly introduced a new feature that enables customers with Swiss accounts to engage in the investment and trading of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nGiven Banco Santander\u2019s extensive history of more than 160 years and its broad customer base of 166 million individuals, the private banking division, which attends to 210,000 affluent clients and oversees assets and deposits amounting to around $315 billion, holds significant influence.\n\nHence, the decision to permit high-net-worth clients associated with Santander Private Banking International to engage in BTC and ETH trading is noteworthy and has notable implications for the industry.\n\nSantander\u2019s Historic Move\n\nAlthough Santander\u2019s initial launch of cryptocurrency trading services is said to be limited to BTC and ETH, the banking giant plans to expand its offerings to include other cryptocurrencies once they meet the specified screening criteria, as per information obtained from an internal communication leak reported by Coindesk.\n\nThe report states that Santander initiated the provision of BTC and ETH trading services in response to client requests via relationship managers.\n\nThe bank intends to safeguard the private cryptographic keys of the tradable assets within a regulated custody framework.\n\nJohn Whelan, head of crypto and digital assets at Santander, reportedly said in an email,\n\n\u201cThe Swiss regulation related to digital assets is one of the first and most advanced in the world since it provides clarity and a comprehensive regulatory environment for our clients. As holding of crypto as an alternative asset class continues to expand, we expect that our clients prefer to rely on their existing financial institutions to be responsible for their assets.\u201d\n\nSantander is yet to officially confirm the development.\n\nTryst With Crypto\n\nThe latest development comes almost a year after Santander announced its intention to restrict UK customers from making real-time payments to cryptocurrency exchanges, citing a commitment to shielding its customers from potential scams.\n\nIt had then cited witnessing \u201ca large increase in UK customers becoming victims of cryptocurrency fraud\u201d behind the decision. The financial giant also expressed intention to further \u201cprotect customers\u201d by blocking all faster payments they identify to cryptocurrency exchanges from Santander accounts, a move that was expected to be implemented during 2023\n\nHowever, by June 2023, the bank had shifted its stance and initiated an educational series for its customers focused on digital assets.\n\nWhat makes this change noteworthy is its alignment with a growing interest from institutional entities in crypto assets. Many traditional institutions have joined the trend of embracing Bitcoin ETFs to offer their clients an indirect exposure to cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Sohrab is a passionate cryptocurrency news writer with over five years of experience covering the industry. He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights A rising wedge pattern leads to the current recovery trend in ETH.\n\nThe ETH price may rise 12% before hitting significant resistance at $2250\n\nA bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of the wedge pattern should intensify the buying momentum.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin struggling to surpass the $38,000 mark and delayed approval from the U.S. SEC for some Bitcoin spot ETF has led to a correction in ETH price after hitting a monthly barrier of $2137. Within a fortnight, the coin price has plunged 6% to currently trade at the $2008 mark.\n\nHowever, this correction could be a minor pullback before the Ethereum price takes the next recovery leap, indicating the ETH price prediction has a bullish outlook for the near future\n\nHealthy Retracement Keeps Ethereum Recovery Intact\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ongoing correction in the Ethereum price can be followed using a downsloping resistance trendline of the 4-hour time frame chart. The coin price reverted several times from the overhead trendline reflecting the market sentiment of selling on a bullish bounce.\n\nUntil this trendline is intact, the ETH price may prolong its ongoing downward trend. However, as per the Fibonacci retracement tool, this pullback is still above the 50% retracement level, which is considered healthy for bullish momentum and carries a long-term recovery.\n\nThus, the market participants bullish on Ethereum should wait for a breakout above the resistance trendline to get better confirmation of trend continuation. The post breakout would surge the prices 12% higher to hit the upper resistant trendline of the long-coming wedge pattern around $2200-$2500.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD indicator: A bearish crossover between the MACD and signal lines projects as a correction trend in action.\n\nEMA: the 20-day EMA slope is offering strong pullback support to the ETH price\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Hit $2500?\n\nA look at the Daily time frame Chart shows the Ethereum price has been carrying a steady uptrend under the influence of a rising wedge pattern. As the anticipated rate is likely to reach the upper resistance of the pattern, the coin price may witness an intense surge in selling pressure around the $2250 mark.\n\nThe historical data shows a retest to the upper trendline has often resulted in a significant correction within the wedge pattern. Thus, for better confirmation of a bullish trend, the buyers must surpass this overhead trendline.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, the wedge pattern breakout could lead the ETH price rally to $3400."

        "content": "So, a new chain has emerged, and this time, it comes with backing from the big names including Paradigm and Standard Crypto. It\u2019s called Blast, and they say, \u201cBlast is the first L2 that incorporates native yield. Your balance on Blast compounds automatically.\u201d\n\nBlast yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The yield from these decentralized protocols is passed back to Blast users automatically. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On Blast, it\u2019s 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins.\n\nHere\u2019s how Blast works.\n\nAuto Rebasing\n\nUsers transact in ETH. Dapps are built around ETH. Blast was designed from the ground up so that ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2.\n\nL1 Staking\n\nBlast only became possible this year following Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade. ETH yield from L1 staking, initially Lido, is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nT-Bill Yield\n\nUsers who bridge stablecoins receive USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol. USDB can be redeemed for USDC when bridging back to Ethereum.\n\nBlast contributors have raised $20m from Paradigm, Standard Crypto, eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, Jeff Lo, and other crypto-natives.\n\nA quick comparison done on the website of Blast shows that it is better than Optimism and Arbitrum in terms of giving native yields, and it shares all the gas revenues with the developers on the chain, and there are substantial incentives to devs compared to what the devs on the other two chains get.\n\nRight now, users can bridge their funds to Blast, get an early entry into the Airdrop leaderboard, and invite friends to make a team that deposits at least 5 ETH in total, so that they qualify for the squad reward where the entire squad is rewarded with points. The Blast Community Airdrop is split between Early Access Members (50%) and Developers (50%). The ETH that you deposit right now is available for withdrawal in February 2024 when Blast Mainnet gets launched, and the actual distribution of Blast airdrop is going to happen in May 2024.\n\nIf you need invite codes for Blast, you can tweet reply to me @thecaptaingates and I will try to share a few as and when I get them from the squad. Make sure you RT the post that mentions Blast."
