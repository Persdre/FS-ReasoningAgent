        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Hard-Fork Strategy to Protect Ethereum From Quantum Attacks - The Quantum Insider",
        "content": "Insider Brief\n\nEthereum co-founder floats a hard fork strategy to safeguard Ethereum funds against potential quantum computer attacks.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s strategy involves a series of measures designed to fortify Ethereum\u2019s defenses.\n\nSome community members have voiced concerns over the efficacy of such measures if quantum computers capable of decrypting Ethereum wallet.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy aimed at safeguarding Ethereum funds against potential quantum computer attacks. This proposal has ignited a widespread discussion on the necessity of quantum security measures within the blockchain ecosystem, as reported by Blockchain.News.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed strategy involves a series of measures designed to fortify Ethereum\u2019s defenses in the event of a quantum computing breach.\n\nA quantum computer\u2019s theoretical ability to solve certain mathematical problems far more efficiently than classical computers are the cause for concern. These cryptographic techniques serve as much of blockchain\u2019s security. Quantum computers could \u2014 again, theoretically \u2014 undermine Ethereum\u2019s cryptographic bedrock by decrypting private keys and compromising the integrity of smart contracts. This quantum capability could also disrupt consensus mechanisms, centralizing control or threatening the security of staked assets, which would Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability and undermining trust in the platform.\n\nKey Steps\n\nKey steps were discussed in the Ethereum Research forum. The steps include the reversion of all blocks subsequent to the detection of a quantum attack, the suspension of traditional externally owned account (EOA) transactions to prevent further vulnerabilities, and the introduction of a new transaction type tailored for smart contract wallets that aligns with the anticipated RIP-7560 standard.\n\nThe proposal also outlines the implementation of an innovative transaction type or opcode that would enable users to submit STARK proofs. These proofs verify the user\u2019s knowledge of a private preimage and a public address generated through approved hash functions, culminating in the replacement of the user\u2019s account code with a quantum-resistant validation mechanism.\n\nAmong these deliberations, the web site reported that some community members voiced concerns that these measures would not be effective if people with malevolent intentions secure quantum computers capable of decrypting Ethereum wallets. These skeptics argue that distinguishing between legitimate owners and attackers could be extremely difficult under such circumstances. They advocate for the adoption of NIST standardized algorithms in a hybrid configuration with classical algorithms, such as combining the Dilithium and ed25519 algorithms, despite the resultant increase in block sizes due to the high number of signature and public key sizes of many current post-quantum schemes.\n\nAlternative propositions include the development of machine learning systems dedicated to the surveillance and identification of anomalous transactions, serving as an early warning mechanism to activate a fail-safe fork.\n\nThe Ethereum community\u2019s engagement with these quantum security challenges underscores the sector\u2019s proactive stance in navigating the security arms race posed by quantum computing advancements. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets, along with the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic solutions in digital signature applications, epitomize the blockchain sector\u2019s commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of technological threats.\n\nIf you found this article to be informative, you can explore more current quantum news here, exclusives, interviews, and podcasts."

        "content": "London Stock Exchange To Accept Bitcoin and Ethereum ETNs Applications Starting Next Quarter\n\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has announced plans to accept applications for Bitcoin and Ether crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the second quarter of 2024. However, the exact date has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAccording to the LSE's Crypto ETN Admission Factsheet, eligible ETNs must be physically backed and non-leveraged. They must also be backed by Bitcoin or Ether and have a market price or value measure of the underlying asset that is publicly available.\n\nThe underlying crypto assets must be held in a cold wallet or similar storage solution, including cold staking, and by a custodian subject to Anti-Money Laundering laws in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland, or the United States.\n\nETNs are debt securities that provide exposure to an underlying asset. They allow investors to trade securities that track the performance of crypto assets during the exchange's trading hours.\n\nThe U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has stated that it will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a market segment for crypto-backed ETNs.\n\nHowever, these products can only be offered to \"professional investors,\" such as credit institutions and investment firms. However, it will not be available to retail investors, with the statement saying:\n\n\u201cThe FCA continues to believe cETNs and crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. As a result, the ban on the sale of cETNs (and crypto derivatives) to retail consumers remains in place.\u201d\n\nThe FCA has also emphasized that cryptocurrencies are still deemed \u201chigh risk and largely unregulated,\u201d and warns the public that their investments could go to zero. The UK government has recently ramped up regulatory efforts in the crypto industry, including allowing law enforcement to seize crypto assets suspected of being involved in illicit activities without a conviction."

Discover SCENE\n\nAmerica's biggest cryptocurrency exchange met with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week over Grayscale's proposed spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund.\n\nPublicly-listed Coinbase gave a presentation to Wall Street's top regulator where it talked about Grayscale's proposed product, documents filed on Wednesday from the regulator show.\n\nIn October, Crypto fund manager Grayscale filed an application with the SEC to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETH ETF. The proposed ETF would give investors direct exposure to the second biggest cryptocurrency; it would trade on a stock exchange\u2014allowing investors to buy shares that track ETH's price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinbase's presentation showed that the crypto exchange had spoken about potential market manipulation and how the exchange would have a \"comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will assist in surveilling for fraud and manipulation.\"\n\n\"Spot markets for ETH are highly indicative of a market resilient to fraud and manipulation,\" the presentation said, adding that the cryptocurrency has \"mechanisms that significantly limit ETH\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.\"\n\nIn January, the SEC gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs to start trading. After a decade of denials, the investment vehicles now trade on stock exchanges, and have been a roaring success, with huge inflows.\n\nGrayscale was one fund manager that received approval; it converted its popular Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nNow, along with other reputable financial institutions, it is trying to get approval from the regulator to do the same with ETH, the second biggest digital coin by market cap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinbase analysis shows correlation b/w ether futures & spot markets every bit as strong as w/ bitcoin markets\u2026 Add-in that SEC approved CME-traded ether futures ETFs and I\u2019m not sure what grounds for disapproval of spot ether ETFs would be. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) March 8, 2024\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered last month said in a report that it expected ETH ETFs to get approval from the SEC by May\u2014and that the asset price could soar as a result.\n\nOn Friday, ETH hit $4,000 per coin for the first time since 2021.

        "title": "3 Reasons Ethereum Price Could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum price broke above $3,9500 barrier again on Feb. 22, while Bitcoin price rally struggles for momentum: 3 vital market metrics suggest ETH could further extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are historically closely correlated, but in 2024, ETH seems to have gained the upper hand. A deep dive into the on-chain data trends and expert analysis provides key insights into which asset would come out on top as the year unfolds.\n\nIs Ethereum better than Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nSo far in 2024, Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two largest assets in the crypto sector have attracted billions of dollars in capital inflows. As of March 2024, BTC is trading at historic all-time highs of $71,200, while ETH price attempts to establish a steady support above the $4,000 milestone.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the price charts shows that ETH currently has the upper hand having outperformed BTC by 7% in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nEthereum (ETH vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Price action January to March 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nThe chart above shows that ETH price has increased 79% between Jan 1 and March 11 2024, which is significantly higher than Bitcoin\u2019s 72% price gains.\n\nHowever, while ETH currently has the upperhand, to determine which asset is a better value for money in 2024, it is important to examine the market catalyst driving both assets.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that both assets are driven by separate narratives and market catalysts in 2024.\n\nFor Ethereum, the ongoing ETH ETF filings, liquidity staking derivatives, the Eigen-layer re-staking and Dencun upgrade have emerged major themes within the ecosystem in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, the dominant themes for Bitcoin are the rapidly growing demand from the 10 newly-approved BTC ETFs and the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 19 2024.\n\nThese key events have triggered diverse changes in on-chain transaction trends and investment patterns across both ecosystems, leading to Ethereum price outpacing Bitcoin.\n\n3 reasons Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nRetail investors are rallying behind ETH as Institutions dominate BTC markets\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 10 new Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 11 2024 marking a real milestone moment for the cryptocurrency sector. Within the 2 months post-launch the ETFs have rapidly acquired about 800,000 BTC, about 4.2% of the total supply in circulation.\n\nEvidently, Bitcoin price has benefited immensely from record-breaking inflows made by the corporate institutional investors in 2024. But interestingly, the ETF\u2019s dominance has triggered a skittish reaction among BTC retail investors, much to the apparent advancement of the Ethereum ecosystem growth.\n\nSantiment\u2019s total holders metric estimates the total number of active or funded wallet addresses that currently exist on a blockchain network. It serves a proxy for measuring the level of adoption among retail investors and the mass markets.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Total Holders vs Bitcoin (BTC) | Source: Santiment\n\nIn the last 50-days dating back to Jan. 21, the Ethereum network has attracted 3.59 million new holder addresses, while 200,000 BTC addresses emptied their wallets and exited the network.\n\nThis rare on-chain trend suggests that the retail mass markets are overwhelming behind Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes more concentrated in the hands of fewer whale investors and corporate entities, it puts BTC price at risk of market manipulation and external shock from the macroeconomic fronts.\n\nThe significant increase in new holder addresses on the Ethereum network compared to the number of BTC addresses emptying their wallets suggests a divergence in retail investor sentiment between the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nFirstly, this trend indicates that retail investors are increasingly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, potentially due to Ethereum\u2019s promise of profit-optimization and passive income from its low-risk staking yield to its retinue of decentralized finance applications (DApps).\n\nFurthermore, the growing dominance of institutional investors and corporate entities in the Bitcoin market introduces a new layer of uncertainty and potential risk. While institutional adoption has been a key driver of Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally, it also increases the susceptibility of the market to large-scale sell-offs or coordinated trading strategies by these influential players.\n\nIn the event of a tradfi market downturn or macroeconomic policy changes, the concentrated ownership of Bitcoin in the hands of highly-sensitive Wall Street players could exacerbate BTC price declines and lead to heightened market volatility.\n\nBitcoin Miners Trading Bearish while Ethereum Node Validators remain bullish\n\nThe divergence in the current trading disposition of Bitcoin miners and Ethereum node validators is another vital market catalyst that could drive ETH price further ahead of BTC. On the Bitcoin network, miners dedicate computing resources to validate transactions and secure the network in exchange of BTC block rewards. Ethereum, since its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), now relies on its node validators for that critical function.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving event slated for April 19, will see miners\u2019 rewards slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.13 BTC. With the event now less than 40-days away Bitcoin miners have entered a selling frenzy in a bid to cash-in before the halving date.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Miner Reserves December 2023 to March 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs of Dec. 29 2023, Bitcoin miners held a total of 1.96 million BTC. But as the halving date drew closer, the miners rapidly offloaded 300,000 BTC, cutting down their balances to just 1.93 million BTC at press time on March 11 2024.\n\nValued at the current prices of $71,200, the miners have sold $21.5 billion worth of BTC in Q1 2024 ahead of the halving.\n\nIf the Bitcoin miner\u2019s selling trend persists, it could slow down the BTC price rally, especially in comparison to Ethereum whose node validators have been accumulating more coins in recent months.\n\nEthereum node validators have doubled down on their bullish positions, depositing 2.4 million ETH worth $9.7 billion into the beacon chain staking contracts since Jan. 2024, meanwhile Bitcoin miners entered a $21.5 billion selling spree.\n\nEthereum (ETH 2.0) Staking Deposits Jan 2024 \u2013 March 2024 | Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nAt press time on March 11, the total staking deposits on the ETH 2.0 beacon chain stood at $1.4 million ETH, representing a 2.4 million ($9.7 billion) increase in 2024.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin miners, Ethereum node validators continue to double-down on their long-term bullish positions as ETH price edges further above the $4,000 mark. Positive speculations surrounding the Dencun upgrade, and progress of ETH ETF filings are key catalysts incentivizing ETH stakeholders\u2019 bullish disposition.\n\nWith these catalysts still in play, ETH could witness even more coins taken out of circulation, while BTC circulation supply increases as miners increase selling pressure as the halving approaches.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Head of Digital Assets to Cryptoquant also echoed this stance in a recent interview with Cryptoquant.\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, ETH tends to outperform BTC in the halving year, right? So I don\u2019t want to lose the forest for the trees. I don\u2019t think there will be flippening, but I do think when the year (2024) is said and done, ETH will have outperformed BTC.\n\nIf these scenarios play out as predicted, ETH price will likely extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead.\n\nTechnical Indicators Highlight Ethereum\u2019s Path to $5,000\n\nIn summary, Ethereum is expected to pull greater retail market demand than Bitcoin and also experience a temporary decline in circulation supply amid rising staking deposits. These key factors put ETH price on a path to a new all time highs above $5,000.\n\nETH is currently trading above the $4,030 range at the time of writing on March 11. IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money chart shows that Ethereum has a relatively clear path to reaching a new all time-high.\n\n\n\nAs seen below, the chart highlights the $4,500 territory as the largest resistance cluster above the current prices. At that range, 617,760 addresses had acquired 1.6 million ETH at the average price of $4,557.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConsidering that they have been holding at a loss for 3-years, many of those holders could move to close their positions once Ethereum prices approach their break-even point.\n\nIf ETH price can establish a steady support level above that $4,500 area, it could potentially propel ETH price to a new all-time high above $5,000."

        "content": "In a recent shift of perspective, Bloomberg analysts have significantly lowered the forecast for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by May \u2014 setting the probability at a mere 35%.\n\nAccording to Eric Balchunas, the odds are down sharply from previous estimates, which ranged between 60% and 70%.\n\nThe revision reflects growing skepticism about the regulatory green light for Ethereum ETFs, contrasting the previously more optimistic stance.\n\nNo sign of activity\n\nThe caution among analysts follows recent discussions between Coinbase, Grayscale, and the SEC regarding the potential conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust into an ETF. While such meetings might usually indicate a positive trajectory, the absence of subsequent SEC commentary has tempered expectations.\n\nBalchunas and other analysts \u2014 including James Seyffart and Eleanor Terret \u2014 said that there is a distinct lack of activity in the regulatory circles despite the deadline being two months away.\n\nIn contrast, there was a flurry of activity among the SEC and spot Bitcoin ETF issuers for more than 10 weeks before the applications were approved.\n\nSeyffart said:\n\n\u201cThis Ethereum ETF cycle feels like the opposite of Bitcoin ETF approval odds at the moment. The more we see/hear (and don\u2019t see/hear), the less optimistic I become.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analysts added that the activity could pick up pace in the coming days. They also said that the expectation remains that an ETH ETF will be approved sometime this year \u2014 even if not in May.\n\nCautiously hopeful\n\nDespite these lowered expectations, some industry observers like Variant Fund\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Jake Chervinsky, remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the upcoming weeks could provide clearer signals about the SEC\u2019s direction.\n\nHowever, he also raised concerns that the SEC may treat Ethereum like a security and would be unwilling to approve the applications without judicial intervention.\n\nThe overall sentiment appears to be veering towards skepticism, with major investment banks such as JPMorgan and TD Cowen also projecting unlikely approval by May.\n\nIn contrast to the Bloomberg analysts, the crypto market-making firm GSR has maintained a more hopeful stance, initially estimating a 70% chance of approval.\n\nHowever, the firm recently admitted that this optimism might soon wane if there\u2019s no visible progress in the next month.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Chartered has said multiple times that the SEC is likely to approve Ethereum ETFs in May.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 8:54 pm UTC on Mar. 11, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 3.37% over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s focus on L2s comes at a cost, spreading liquidity across dozens of blockchains.\n\nLayer 3 blockchain ZkLink Nova, which aggregates liquidity across five L2s, launched Monday.\n\nEthereum\u2019s mass market appeal rests on so-called layer 2 blockchains: faster, cheaper blockchains that funnel into Ethereum, letting users dodge its notoriously high transaction fees.\n\nThere are more than 40 of these layer 2 blockchains, according to one estimate. Most are islands unto themselves: although protocols like PancakeSwap, a decentralised exchange, can be found on several layer 2 blockchains, assets on the many versions of PancakeSwap are siloed.\n\nA new layer 3 blockchain \u2014 a layer 2 for layer 2s \u2014 aims to fix that.\n\nZkLink Nova, which launched Monday, aggregates liquidity across five layer 2 blockchains: zkSync, Linea, Arbitrum, Manta, and Mantle.\n\n\u201cThe point is to deploy products that can, sort of, unify liquidity and users,\u201d Declan Fox, head of business development at Linea, told DL News.\n\nThat means that an application deployed on those blockchains effectively shares assets. This larger pool of assets \u2014 or deeper liquidity, in market-speak \u2014 should make it easier to execute large trades without affecting an asset\u2019s price.\n\nThe L2 boom\n\nLike all blockchains, Ethereum groups transactions into blocks, then appends them to an immutable ledger. Its transaction fee reflects the demand for space in each block, spiking along with user activity.\n\nBut a spike in activity can send the cost of a single transaction well above $100, an astronomical sum for the average investor.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nDevelopers have bet the most convenient road to mass market appeal goes through cheaper layer 2 blockchains, which batch transactions before appending them to Ethereum.\n\nThat plan is coming to fruition. There are more than 40 layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT, and another 35 in development.\n\nExisting layer 2 blockchains have processed almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself over the past year, according to data collected by Jack Gorman, a data scientist at venture capital firm Variant Fund.\n\nEthereum users have enjoyed massive savings: The average cost to swap tokens on Ethereum was just under $17 Monday morning, according to l2fees.info. It was between $0.68 and $2.16 on the major layer 2 blockchains the website tracks.\n\nlayer 3 blockchains take the concept a step further, creating a sort of blockchain-based Russian nesting doll in which each layer is cheaper than the last.\n\nzkLink Nova\n\nUnlike the few existing layer 3 blockchains, zkLink Nova will be general purpose rather than application specific.\n\nZkLink spokesman Neil Liew said Nova would offer \u201creal interoperability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Nova there is no need to bridge assets across chains, because the same ERC-20 token on zkSync and Linea, for example, is represented as a single token on zkLink Nova,\u201d he said. \u201cNova simplifies DeFi by presenting a unified ecosystem for users and DApps, promoting a seamless blockchain experience.\u201d\n\nWhile it aggregates transactions across several blockchains, it settles on Linea, an L2 that also runs on zero-knowledge technology. ZK technology creates \u201cproofs\u201d that are posted to Ethereum for verification.\n\n\u201cYou get additional savings on the settlement cost,\u201d Fox said.\n\n\u201cRather than having to verify your proof directly on Ethereum, which is costly \u2026 what you\u2019re doing now is, you\u2019re actually settling on Linea, and Linea gas price is orders of magnitude cheaper than Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLiew said zkLink will add other L2 blockchains in the future, and should be considered a complimentary, rather than competitive, product.\n\n\u201cWe are facilitating more user flow and liquidity flow into their chains and enhancing capital efficiency between the chains,\u201d he said.\n\nZkLink\u2019s three-step roadmap includes the eventual launch of ZKL, a governance token issued to incentivize a decentralised sequencer \u2014 the technology that orders transactions on layer 2 and layer 3 blockchains.\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

For reference, the Bitcoin price is actively in discovery mode, and it just recorded another all-time high (ATH) above $71,000 as optimism surrounding the coin remains sustained.\n\nDespite the $250,000 price target, Raoul Pal is not convinced this is the best the digital currency could do. He noted that the valuation could be higher depending on the trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF has remained the dominant catalyst driving the price of BTC to new heights. The daily accumulation from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Ark Invest and Bitwise, notably surpassed the amount of BTC generated through mining.\n\nWhile an average of 5,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC is stacked up daily, only about 900 BTC are generated across the board, creating a notable supply shock that might help drive the price toward the estimated $250,000 in the long term.\n\nEthereum and Solana get high targets\n\nIn addition to the Bitcoin forecast, Raoul Pal projected a $17,000 to $20,000 surge for Ethereum this bull cycle, while he noted that Solana might jump as high as $700 to $1,000.\n\nWhile the duo of Ethereum and Solana have not retested their respective ATHs at $4,800 and $260 this ongoing bullish run, Raoul Pal has always highlighted their fundamentals as a key catalyst that can drive growth in the long term.\n\nOther analysts have even more bullish projections for Bitcoin as well as Ethereum and Solana, and time will tell how high the three digital currencies will grow this bull cycle."

        "content": "Bitcoin's streak of generating new all-time highs may not be over, prompting growing interest in other key digital assets.\n\nIt's another hot start to what looks likely to be another big week in the cryptocurrency world. Leading cryptos are once again surging, with Bitcoin (BTC 0.16%), Ethereum (ETH -0.28%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -3.98%) all making big moves.\n\nAs of 12:15 p.m. ET Monday, these three mega-cap cryptos had surged 3.8%, 2.9%, and 0.9%, respectively, over the prior 24 hours. Importantly, Bitcoin made a new all-time high above $72,500. In the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), continued capital inflows into those funds are creating a clear supply-and-demand imbalance for this top crypto. This catalyst, as well as anticipation of the upcoming halving event in April -- which will cut the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half and thus reduce the volume of new Bitcoin being created -- is exacerbating expectations that Bitcoin's recent momentum can continue.\n\nMost investors who follow crypto can understand the rather simple dynamics driving Bitcoin higher. But for more complex reasons, Bitcoin's recent surge could also mean continued upside for Ethereum and Dogecoin, two projects that are very different from Bitcoin in key ways.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin's move a sectorwide phenomenon?\n\nThere's certainly something to be said about Bitcoin's status as the key crypto benchmark other digital assets are valued against. The Bitcoin/U.S. dollar exchange rate is very important in the crypto world, with Bitcoin largely being viewed as the currency of choice for this sector. That should mean that as Bitcoin becomes more valuable, other tokens relative to Bitcoin should become relatively cheaper, at least compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, during previous rallies, this hasn't been the case. And while capital is clearly flowing in one direction (toward Bitcoin via these exchange-traded funds), it's also true that retail investors and even some large money managers are finding ways to accumulate other cryptocurrencies ahead of what many expect could be a continued rally in risk assets.\n\nFor Ethereum specifically, the possibility that a spot Ethereum ETF could be approved as soon as May is a key catalyst many investors are watching. The Ethereum network is also undertaking a number of upgrades, including the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which is expected to unfold within two days. As investors may remember, \"the Merge\" upgrade created significant hype for this network as Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake protocol from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol. The Dencun upgrade will look to build on that progress, with a focus on reducing Layer-2 transaction costs and making the network more efficient.\n\nFor meme tokens like Dogecoin, it has been \"party on,\" mostly due to the risk-on atmosphere that has been building in pockets of the market. Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin that rely more on the value of their community and backers have seen outsized interest as a result of surging asset prices across the board in this sector. For now, the thesis supporting Dogecoin's rise may be as simple as \"price goes up,\" but it's also true that leveraged bets to the upside via long perpetual contracts are playing into Dogecoin's surge in recent days.\n\nHow long will this party continue?\n\nUntil we see some sort of slowdown in the flow of capital into Bitcoin, it appears increasingly unlikely we'll see the kind of material pullback many crypto bears have been predicting. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have siphoned an incredible amount of capital from institutional investors in record time, and the level of demand has surprised even some of the most ardent crypto bulls. If Ethereum and other digital assets can see similar waves of investment, all bets are off with respect to how long this period of price appreciation may last.\n\nUpgrades and other utility-generating use cases for a wide range of cryptocurrencies (and select meme tokens can be included in this group) could drive the fundamental investing thesis behind these digital assets as well. While I'm less enthusiastic about Dogecoin's long-term prospects relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, its recent move is worth noting. In the crypto sector, speculative interest can manifest itself in significant near-term volatility, as we've seen play out in the past. Accordingly, these are three tokens every investor interested in the crypto space will want to watch moving forward."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, is adequately prepared to counter the potential threat posed by a large-scale quantum computing attack on the network.\n\nIn a recent post on Ethereum Research dated March 9, Buterin outlined a sudden \u201cquantum emergency\u201d where quantum computers are suddenly accessible, and malicious actors can exploit them to steal users\u2019 assets.\n\nHe discussed Ethereum\u2019s readiness to handle such a situation, emphasizing its ability to mitigate the impact and protect users\u2019 funds in the event of such an attack.\n\nIf the blockchain were to undergo a hard fork, users would just need to update their software, minimizing the risk of fund loss. Buterin elaborated that the hard fork would involve rolling back the Ethereum network to a point where it\u2019s evident that significant theft occurred and then halting all regular transactions from that moment onward.\n\nDevelopers would then introduce a new transaction type, outlined in EIP-7560, specifically designed to enable transactions from smart contract wallets.\n\nIn a scenario where transactions are made from an Ethereum wallet, the signature of the transaction discloses the public key. In a \u201cpost-quantum era,\u201d this exposure could potentially reveal the user\u2019s private key.\n\nThe proposed quantum-resistant Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introduces a new transaction type that relies on Winternitz signatures and advanced cryptographic techniques like STARKs. This aims to update existing wallet validation mechanisms, ensuring enhanced security against quantum threats without compromising user privacy.\n\nThis verification code utilizes ERC-4337 account abstraction, which is the foundational technology of smart contract wallets. It prevents the exposure of private keys when signing transactions in the future, thus making these accounts resistant to quantum attacks."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum developers will roll out the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade on Wednesday, March 13. Developers have told Decrypt that the impact on gas fees for Ethereum scaling networks will be dramatic, with some estimating that they'll drop by 75% immediately.\n\nThe name is a portmanteau of Cancun and Deneb, two separate upgrades that have been combined to create the term \"Dencun.\" A word of caution for Ethereum upgrade first-timers: There's nothing that users need to do. Be wary of any blog, email, or Twitter (aka X) post that says otherwise and asks you to click a link or connect your wallet.\n\nLeading up to the upgrade, Dencun has already been pushed live on several of Ethereum's testnets. But the real push, to Ethereum's mainnet, will occur later this week. The upgrade is happening roughly a year after the Shanghai upgrade from April 2023, when the newly upgraded proof-of-stake network made it possible for users to unstake their ETH.\n\nThis new upgrade is targeted at addressing core aspects of Ethereum\u2019s framework, including its scalability, security, and overall user experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of proto-danksharding, a cutting-edge concept designed to significantly reduce transaction fees and increase processing speed across the network.\n\n\"This is the beginning of a new paradigm for how Ethereum operates,\u201d Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, which builds layer-2 network Optimism, told Decrypt earlier this month.\n\nThe optimization is expected to make Ethereum a more attractive network to build on for startups, which could add even more protocols to its already bustling decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nEthereum has long hosted the largest DeFi ecosystem when measured by the number of protocols. In fact, it has seldom accounted for less than half of the entire total value locked in DeFi projects. At the time of writing, there are 990 Ethereum-based projects, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upgrade also includes several key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), each tailored to enhance specific functionalities within the network. For example, EIP-7044 will introduce programmable staking exits.\n\nValidators secure the Ethereum network by locking up 32 ETH as their pledge to keep their validator client running and handle the transactions that come their way. If they don't, they stand to lose a portion of their 32 ETH to penalties.\n\nFor users who don't have 32 ETH to become a solo staker, there are pooled staking options. They allow users to deposit any amount of Ethereum and earn a share of the staking rewards (minus the pool fees, of course).\n\nBut what happens if the validator with whom you've staked your ETH experiences downtime and part of your staked funds get slashed?\n\nEIP-7044 will make it possible for ETH validators and stakers to store instructions for when to exit their position\u2014called perpetually valid signed voluntary exits\u2014in smart contracts, and specify when they should be carried out.\n\nFor example, someone running a validator node may want to exit if their hardware remains inactive for a certain number of blocks processed. This is an important protection for validators because they could face mounting fines if they're unable to process transactions on time.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Amidst this bull run, ETH prices tapped new yearly highs, feeding optimism around the crypto\u2019s outlook. The big question now is: just how high can Ethereum trend in the months ahead?\n\nAnalysis of price charts reveals Ethereum, with its $479 billion market cap, has surged past the $4,000 level for the first time in two years. A 75% increase in trading volumes to $22 billion supports this signal of strengthening upside momentum.\n\nAfter logging 15% gains last week, ETH has rallied 60% across the past 30 days.

However, prices could also consolidate or correct before any potential further upside.\n\nEthereum hit its all-time high of $4,891 on November 16, 2021. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency is just 18% away from breaching its previous all-time highs.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Forecasted To Surge 540% & Hit New ATH: Here\u2019s When\n\nOf course, if existing market conditions deteriorate again, Ethereum may see a downside. However, indicators presently favor the ongoing bullish structure persisting through February.\n\nSo, with ETH firmly back in recovery mode, early technical clues support the growing narrative of history repeating itself this cycle. If Bitcoin manages to sustain the $71,000 level, ETH and other altcoins could stage a bullish outlook in the coming days."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes a Quantum-Resistant Hard Fork for Ethereum Jessie A Ellis Vitalik Buterin proposes a hard fork strategy for Ethereum to protect funds against quantum computer attacks, sparking a community-wide discussion on quantum security.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy. This preemptive measure is designed to protect user funds in the event that quantum computers become capable of breaking current cryptographic defenses.\n\nThe proposal, outlined in a discussion on the Ethereum Research forum, highlights the urgency of preparing for quantum computers' ability to solve problems like the discrete logarithm, which underpins the security of many current cryptographic algorithms including those used by Ethereum.\n\nThe proposed hard fork would entail the following steps:\n\nReversion of all blocks following the detection of large-scale quantum attacks. Disabling traditional externally owned account (EOA) transactions to prevent further vulnerability. Introduction of a new transaction type for smart contract wallets, in line with the anticipated RIP-7560 standard. Implementation of a new transaction type or opcode allowing users to submit STARK proofs, demonstrating the knowledge of a private preimage and a public address derived through approved hash functions. The user's account code would then be replaced with a new, quantum-resistant validation code.\n\nThe conversation in the Ethereum community is informed by a range of expert inputs. One participant shared a visual aid to help understand the proof statement, while others discussed existing quantum-secure fallbacks for wallets and the integration of preimages into ECDSA signature nonces to create fail-stop signature schemes.\n\nSome community members have cautioned that if quantum computers capable of cracking Ethereum wallets are already in malicious hands, it might be too late to differentiate between legitimate owners and attackers. They suggest that instead of relying on stateful post-quantum algorithms, Ethereum should use NIST standardized ones in hybrid mode with a classical algorithm, like combining Dilithium with ed25519. This would, however, increase block sizes due to the large signature and public key sizes of current post-quantum schemes.\n\nOthers have proposed the development of machine learning systems to monitor and detect abnormal transactions as an early warning system to trigger a fail-safe fork.\n\nThe community's response underlines the importance of staying ahead in the security arms race against quantum computing. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets are already in development, as is the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic measures in other digital signature applications.\n\nThis initiative by the Ethereum community reflects the broader blockchain ecosystem's commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of emerging technological threats. As quantum computing advances, the blockchain sector's proactive stance on security promises to be a critical factor in its long-term viability and trustworthiness.\n\nThe Ethereum team and community's proactive approach to quantum security demonstrates a clear recognition of the challenges ahead and a willingness to address them head-on. This ongoing conversation will likely shape the future of Ethereum's infrastructure and set a precedent for other blockchain platforms."

        "title": "Comparison Between Solana and Ethereum - ForexLive",
        "content": "When evaluating the blockchain space, two platforms frequently come up for comparison: Solana and Ethereum. Both have garnered significant attention, each with its own set of strengths that appeal to different users and developers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nPerformance and Transaction Speed\n\nOne of the most notable differences between Solana and Ethereum is in terms of performance, particularly transaction speed. Solana has made a name for itself with its high throughput capacity, being able to handle about 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum currently processes roughly 30 TPS. This stark contrast is due to Solana\u2019s unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (PoH), combined with the Proof of Stake (PoS) model, which allows for quicker validation of transactions and blocks.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to a PoS system through its Ethereum 2.0 update, aiming to increase its transaction speed and reduce energy consumption. However, until this transition is complete, Solana takes the lead in performance.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is another crucial factor in the comparison. Solana's architecture gives it a significant scalability edge, allowing for the support of thousands of nodes without sacrificing speed. Ethereum, with its current architecture, faces challenges in scaling, although layer two solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum are providing off-chain scaling options. The shift to Ethereum 2.0 also promises to address these concerns by introducing sharding, which will spread the network load across 64 new chains.\n\nCost\n\nTransaction costs are vastly different on Solana compared to Ethereum. Solana boasts extremely low transaction fees due to its efficient processing capabilities. Ethereum's fees, however, can vary widely and tend to be much higher, especially during periods of network congestion. This aspect makes Solana more attractive for microtransactions and decentralized applications (dApps) requiring a large number of transactions.\n\nDecentralization and Security\n\nEthereum is widely recognized for its level of decentralization and security, having a large and diversified network of nodes. While Solana\u2019s architecture has led to a smaller node count, its newer network hasn't yet faced the same level of scrutiny or attack as Ethereum. Thus, Ethereum might be seen as more secure and decentralized at this moment.\n\nEcosystem and Adoption\n\nEthereum has a first-mover advantage, being the pioneer for smart contracts and dApps. It has an enormous and thriving ecosystem with a multitude of dApps, tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Solana is newer but growing quickly, developing its ecosystem and attracting developers with its performance benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether Solana is \"better\" than Ethereum depends largely on what metric you're measuring. If transaction speed and cost are your primary concerns, Solana may appear to be the superior platform. If decentralization, security, and ecosystem maturity are more important, Ethereum might be the preferred choice. Ultimately, the \"better\" platform will depend on the specific needs of the users and developers, and the continuous evolution of both platforms keeps this as an ongoing conversation in the blockchain community."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH-USD) levels are currently under scrutiny as cryptocurrency analysts and investors peer into its performance after breaking the $4,000 value area \u2013 a level not seen for ETH since December 2021.\n\nAs the leading altcoin and second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap behind Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum has fundamentally redefined how applications are built and operated on the Internet. It boasts a robust ecosystem that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nThis in-depth analysis of the daily and weekly charts reveals a nuanced picture: weekly indicators signal caution, while daily trends suggest resilience and potential for continued upward momentum.\n\nAnalysis of the Daily Chart: Potential for Continued Uptrend\n\nETH-USD Daily Chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical conditions on the daily chart exhibit signs of bearish sentiment. The Composite Index, a crucial momentum indicator, has decisively crossed below its moving averages and is a bearish warning sign, indicating potential downward pressure on price.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO), which remains above the zero line. The DPO\u2019s position indicates underlying strength, suggesting that the prior uptrend may continue despite the immediate bearish outlook.\n\nInsights from the Weekly Chart: Indicators Suggest Caution\n\nETH-USD Weekly Chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nExpanding our analysis to the weekly timeframe reveals a broader perspective of Ethereum\u2019s market trajectory. The trendlines, extending back to July 2022, illustrate a dominant upward trend, with the recent steepening slope suggesting a parabolic rise.\n\nThe immediate support level on this parabolic trendline is identified at $3,687. Furthermore, the Composite Index has reached historical resistance levels and shows a downward slope, while the DPO marks its highest levels since August 2021, signaling potential volatility.\n\nThe Outlook Is Mixed\n\nWhile long-term indicators suggest a cautious approach due to bearish signals, hidden strength on the daily chart and the strong support levels identified on the weekly chart offer a counterbalance. These insights suggest that while near-term volatility is likely, given the increased institutional interest in Ethereum and a broader bullish mood for crypto, a resumption of the uptrend has a strong probability of occurring."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been on a tear since late last year, as buying interest perked up in anticipation of a regulatory nod for spot Bitcoin BTC/USD exchange-traded funds. Although the rally stalled after the SEC approval came through in early January, it resumed after the lull.\n\nWhich of the widely owned and popular cryptos generated better returns for investors?\n\nStratospheric Climb: After a forgettable 2022, most cryptocurrencies began to take off in 2023, with most of the upside taking place toward the back half of the year. The upside is in part due to bargain hunting as investors looked past scandals and general risk aversion improved. But much of the buoyancy came on the back of optimism over the spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the impact it would have on the space.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF was perceived as a way for investors to gain more exposure to digital assets without having to directly own them, which could encourage wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin ended 2022 with a loss of over 64% at $16,547.50. The crypto began a slow and steady recovery in 2023, and the rally began to accelerate only after the apex crypto broke above a key resistance around $30,000 in late-October. After moving sideways for much of January, the Bitcoin rally reaccelerated in February.\n\nDespite warnings from skeptics about a potential correction, crypto investors appear to have thrown caution to the winds and continued buying.\n\nSee Also: Best Online Cryptocurrency Brokers\n\nReturns From Investment: Bitcoin is trading just shy of the $70,000 mark after pushing past the level last week. The performance of Ethereum ETH/USD, the second-biggest crypto, has been a silent performer.\n\nMeme coin Shiba Inu SHIB/USD, though late to the party, has made strong gains this year. Dogecoin DOGE/USD, another favorite, has also gained traction.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical scenario in which an investor made a $1,000 bet on each of these cryptos, here\u2019s how much return it would have generated now.\n\n$1,000 invested in Bitcoin at the end of October would have fetched 0.029 Bitcoin. It would be worth $1,975.87 now (based on Saturday\u2019s closing price). This translates to a return of about 98% in little over three months.\n\nThe same $1,000 invested in Ethereum at the end of October would have fetched 0.55 of the crypto. This would be worth about $2,150, a return of about 115%.\n\nIf the investor had put in the dollars in SHIB, the $1,000 would have got him 125,000,000 SHIBs. The same would be worth $4,250, a 325% return.\n\nIf the investor had opted to plow in $1,000 in DOGE at the end of October, he would have received 14,646 of the meme coin. At Saturday\u2019s closing, the holding would be worth $2,623, a gain of 162%.\n\nAt last check, Bitcoin rose 1.61% at $69,472.43, Ethereum was up a modest 0.31% at $3,906.97, while SHIB fell 4.61% to $0.000034 and Doge slipped 3.25% to $0.174072, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next: \u2018May Be I Should Buy Some Bitcoin,\u2019 Says Bill Ackman As He Weighs In On Energy-Guzzling Crypto Mining, MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor Says He Would Like To Discuss 1-On-1\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving an Ethereum (ETH) spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has significantly decreased.\n\nThis is evidenced by market sentiment on platforms like Polymarket, where the approval odds dropped to 24%.\n\nDespite the crypto community's optimism earlier this year, recent developments indicate a growing skepticism about the SEC's approval of Ethereum ETFs, particularly in the lead-up to the anticipated decision date of May 23.\n\nDiminishing optimism\n\nEleanor Terrett, a reporter at Fox Business, has noted that there has been a significant change in mood regarding the SEC's stance on Ethereum ETFs.\n\nInsiders suggest that the SEC, under Chairman Gary Gensler, is less engaged in discussions about Ethereum ETFs compared to their Bitcoin counterparts, hinting at a possible contentment with the progress made with Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, political pressure from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs, seems to be influencing the regulator's approach toward Ethereum products.\n\nRegulatory delays\n\nThe SEC has recently postponed its decision on various Ethereum ETF proposals, including those from financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity. This has set the stage for further uncertainty despite the fact that such an outcome was expected by market analysts.\n\nThis delay signals a cautious approach from the SEC, mirroring its previous hesitance with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg, has tempered expectations for Ether ETFs, likening them to an opening act following a headliner. Jake Chervinsky, Variant's chief legal officer, speculated the SEC's cautious approach is influenced by political resistance and market volatility.\n\nDespite this, the crypto industry remains hopeful, looking for signs of potential approval in the regulator's future actions and commentary."

        "content": "New York, Mar 10, 2024 -Bitcoin has captured the limelight in recent weeks as it surged to a new record high, yet another major cryptocurrency , Ether, has been enjoying its own meteoric rise.Launched in 2015, Ether, also known as Ethereum , is by far the second-largest digital currency in terms of total value, now estimated at over $460 billion.Along with other cryptocurrencies including Solana and Dogecoin, it benefited from the regulatory approval in the United States of a new bitcoin investment product, the exchange traded fund -- or ETF -- in mid-January, said James Butterfill of the investment company CoinShares.These ETFs allow investors to profit from any change to the price of cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly, while also letting them sell at any time.The launch of crypto ETFs has led to an influx of new money, sending bitcoin to a fresh record on Friday of $70,085.Bitcoin's rise has been well-documented, but Ether's has been even more impressive, surging almost 72 percent year to date in comparison to bitcoin's 61 percent rise.This strong performance is largely due to \"expectations that an Ethereum ETF could be approved in the United States,\" according to Dessislava Aubert of research firm Kaiko.Several asset management companies have applied for authorization from the US financial markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to market these Ether investment products.The SEC must rule on the first such applications, from VanEck and Ark 21Shares, by May 23 at the latest.\"Ethereum has started to wake up as investors are anticipating a potential approval,\" Michael van de Poppe of MN Trading told AFP, adding that \"people are rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum as a potential investment opportunity.\"Beyond the ETF effect, the digital currency dreamed up by Russian programmer Vitaly Buterin has several other cards up its sleeve.For Simon Peters of cryptocurrency exchange eToro, Ethereum is also buoyed by the prospect of \"Dencun,\" a major upgrade to the technology underlying this digital currency, scheduled for March 13.This major change will improve transaction processing capacity and cut transaction costs, but also has the potential to unleash the growth of an ecosystem with multiple applications.\"Bitcoin's primary use is as store of value, while Ethereum has much more potential use cases,\" Peters told AFP.For example, it is the destination of choice for non-fungible tokens -- or NFTs -- the certificates of digital authenticity that caused such a stir three years ago.The two cryptocurrencies are not in direct competition, according to van de Poppe from MN Trading, because Bitcoin is \"hard money,\" while Ether \"is basically an investment for the entire blockchain and smart contract ecosystem.\"Ethereum has already successfully negotiated two major technical transformations in recent years, including the switch to a less energy-intensive system in September 2022.James Butterfill said there is \"increasing optimism\" that a \"Dencun\" upgrade will \"go without a hitch,\" which would reinforce the currency's credibility.He added that Ether, by the very nature of its operation, offers the \"added benefit\" of interest generated by its holders.The mechanism for creating this currency involves owners putting up existing Ether coins as collateral in a process known as \"Proof of Stake,\" which differs from bitcoin's energy-intensive method involving highly complex calculations, known as \"Proof of Work.\"Ether investors who agree to put up some or all of their holdings receive a fee of a few percent a year, in addition to any potential capital gain if the currency appreciates in value.The \"Proof of Stake\" process adopted in September 2022 has significantly increased the amount of Ether used as collateral, notes Simon Peters, currently at 21 percent compared with just 10 percent 18 months ago.\"There is less Ethereum in circulation,\" he said, adding: \"If demand increases, given the squeeze in supply, then price should follow.\"\"I think that Ethereum is going to be outperforming Bitcoin,\" said Michael van de Poppe, adding the total market capitalization of Ethereum could end up exceeding that of bitcoin."

        "content": "The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has attracted a fresh influx of investors, driving a notable increase in trading volume. This trend has generated a wave of optimism that extends beyond Bitcoin itself.\n\nBut this hasn\u2019t made the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF any earlier as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently evaluating the possibility of such a fund. Despite the uncertainty, experts appear to be bullish on the trajectory of the world\u2019s largest altcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bullish Outlook\n\nBitcoin is gearing up for another important event this year in the form of halving, which is scheduled for April this year. Looking at the previous halving events, Matthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s Head of Digital Assets, for one, has shared a bullish outlook for Ethereum.\n\nThe executive expressed doubt regarding the occurrence of a \u201cflippening,\u201d a scenario where Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin as the leading crypto asset. However, he anticipates that Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin in terms of performance.\n\nIn a statement to CryptoQuant, Sigel said,\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, ETH tends to outperform BTC in the halving year, right? So I don\u2019t want to lose the forest for the trees. I don\u2019t think there will be flippening, but I do think when the year is said and done, ETH will have outperformed BTC.\u201d\n\nDelays in Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe VanEck exec discussed the regulatory challenges facing the asset class in the United States, noting that the government\u2019s reluctance to involve banks and brokers poses a significant hurdle.\n\nThis cautious approach by financial institutions has affected the listing of ETFs related to crypto assets as well, with the SEC once again delaying its decision to approve or reject BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF.\n\n\u201cThe US government doesn\u2019t want banks and brokers to touch these assets, right? So as you see the distribution strategies by money managers and financial advisors, you will notice that the banks and the bank-owned brokers have been slow, or are not listing these ETFs as well. We do expect that regulation to change over time, but it is a considerable headwind and we constantly have to remind ourselves that this is not a US asset class. This is the anti-dollar.\u201d\n\nA similar sentiment was echoed by Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer of crypto firm Variant. He said the SEC is facing increasing political pressure and navigating through market instability, both of which may impact its decision-making process on spot Ethereum ETFs."

        "content": "Last week, bitcoin hit new records in volatile trading for the first time since 2021, before more subdued trading over the weekend.\n\nThe price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $72,022.16, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it reached an all-time high of $72,750.16.\n\nAt the same time, heightened leverage in the crypto market has led to the biggest price swings in nearly a year, with funding rates at their highest levels since January 2021 and bitcoin open interest at all-time highs.\n\nInflows into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs continue to drive the cryptocurrency's price action. Last week, crypto investment products saw record inflows totaling $2.7 billion, according to CoinShares. That put the year-to-date total at $10.3 billion, just off the record of $10.6 billion for all of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, ether broke $4,000 for the first time since December 2021, lifted in part by bitcoin. It was last higher by 3% at $4,034.00.\n\nInvestors were also looking ahead to the Ethereum network's next big tech upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun,\" this week. In the past, the crypto asset has rallied into the day of the upgrade and then seen traders sell on the event.\n\nCiti analyst Alex Saunders pointed out in a note Monday that price action could look different for Dencun given the strength of other key crypto catalysts in play at the moment \u2013 specifically, the inflows into bitcoin ETFs, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the potential that the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve trading of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. in May.\n\nCompanies whose performance is tied to the price of bitcoin was mixed on Monday. Crypto exchange Coinbase advanced gave back earlier gains but closed just under flat as the broader rally in tech cooled. Bitcoin proxy Microstrategy rose 4% after the company purchased another roughly 12,000 bitcoins for more than $821 million in cash, according to a filing.\n\nMiners fell. Marathon Digital lost 12%, CleanSpark fell 16%, Iris Energy lost 5% and Riot Platforms slipped 4%. These were some of the biggest stock market gainers in February but have turned lower for March as investors digest the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, when mining companies' revenue will be slashed.\n\nNew U.K. crypto trading products\n\nElsewhere, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said Monday that it would allow exchanges to list cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded products for the first time \u2013 two months after spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S.\n\nSpecifically, the FCA said it would not object to requests from recognized investment exchanges to create a U.K.-listed market segment for crypto-backed exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. The London Stock Exchange said it will accept applications for the admission of bitcoin and ether ETNs from the second quarter of this year.\n\nUnlike an ETF, which is a fund that holds assets, an ETN is an unsecured debt security issued by a bank. It is typically linked to a market index or other benchmark. An ETN promises to pay out at maturity the full value of the index, minus management fees.\n\nBitcoin bulls note this will lead to increased institutional investment into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They say this will, in turn, impact the price positively as more serious money floods into the market."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has surpassed $4,000, reaching a new yearly high and marking a significant milestone in its recovery.\n\nThis price surge reignites interest in ETH and signals strong momentum within the broader crypto market.\n\nCatalysts like the upcoming Dencun upgrade, potentially reduced gas fees, and growing DeFi & NFT sectors drive ETH\u2019s growth.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has finally made a triumphant comeback, breaking through the $4,000 barrier for the first time since late 2021. This surge in price occurred right alongside Bitcoin\u2019s successful attempt at setting a new ATH at over $71k. ETH\u2019s present price milestone underscores the leading altcoin\u2019s resilience and further highlights the increasing optimism surrounding the crypto industry\u2019s future.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nThe recent climb of Ethereum\u2019s price can be attritbuted to a number of different related factors. These include the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which promises significant improvements in the Ethereum network\u2019s scalability and reduced transaction fees, and is expected to happen sooner rather than later. Ethereum also remains as the dominant platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, which have continued to thrive and keep growing up to now.\n\nKeeping Up with Bitcoin\n\nThe news of ETH\u2019s $4,000 breakthrough coincides with BTC\u2019s surge to an entirely new ATH price of more than $71,000. As Bitcoin spends more time trading sideways in the next few weeks or months, it is highly expected that altcoins like Ethereum will take over the narrative as part of the typical \u201caltcoin season\u201d that comes along with every recorded instance of increased institutional and retail interest.\n\nThe last time that ETH\u2019s price was at the $4,000 level was back in late 2021, which is more than 24 months ago. Its return to this price level now is taken by some experts as a signal of bullish sentiment resurgence. At the same time, it can also be seen as reinforcement of the positive correlation between BTC\u2019s price performance and the broader altcoin market.\n\nUnleash the potential of leverage trading!

        "content": "Unibot\u2019s native token fell past $50 today.\n\nConflict has broken out between the popular Telegram bot\u2019s Ethereum and Solana developers.\n\nBoth sides traded accusations of breach of trust.\n\nUnibot\u2019s token fell more than 40% today as news emerged of infighting between its Ethereum and Solana developers of the popular Telegram trading bot with over $1.1 billion in volume.\n\nUnibot\u2019s Ethereum developers said they had ended their collaboration with their Solana counterparts, accusing them of reneging on previous agreements.\n\nThe Solana group confirmed the split, announcing plans to rebrand from Unibot\u2019s Ethereum team.\n\nUnibot is a Telegram trading bot on both Ethereum and Solana. It first emerged on the Ethereum mainnet last May, followed by a Solana deployment in January.\n\nUnibot users, especially those who use the Solana-based iteration, now find themselves in the lurch.\n\nToday\u2019s split is the latest problem to rock Unibot, which was previously hacked for $5.6 million last year. These problems have contributed to the project falling further behind its major rival, Banana Gun bot.\n\nUnibot and Banana Gun bot belong to a class of projects that allow crypto users to trade tokens using only a few simple commands on Telegram.\n\nUnibot token slumps below $50 amid in-fighting between project teams\n\nTelegram bots have evolved into a crypto niche in their own right and boast a $1.6 billion market capitalisation, according to Coingecko.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nApart from trading, several bots also share revenue with users, and some of them help traders automate airdrop farming activities.\n\nUnibot developers lance accusations\n\nThe Ethereum developers behind Unibot accused the Solana group of a breach of trust because the latter also launched a version of the bot on the Blast blockchain without its approval. Blast is a layer-two blockchain built by the same team behind the NFT marketplace Blur.\n\nUnibot\u2019s Ethereum developers accused its Solana counterparts of refusing to undergo the KYC identification process, too.\n\nAs such, the Unibot Ethereum team demanded the Solana group change its name which is currently Unibot on Solana.\n\nFollowing the split, the Unibot Ethereum developers launched a Unisol X frontend for users on Solana as an alternative to the Unibot on Solana bot. They decided to launch a second front because they are no longer working with the Solana group.\n\nResponding to Unibot\u2019s accusations, Reethmos, the pseudonymous Unibot on Solana builder, said the split would not affect its users.\n\nUnibot has earned over $53 million in revenue since inception. (whale_hunter/Dune)\n\nReethmos countered Unibot\u2019s statement and accused the Ethereum developers of engineering the split because the Solana team blocked their access to the bot\u2019s revenue.\n\n\u201cThey farmed $30 million from tax farming but apparently it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Reethmos said on X, formerly Twitter. Tax farming is the practice of levying fees on token swaps, and Unibot\u2019s Ethereum developers earn 40% of the tax imposed on trading the token.\n\nUnibot generates revenue across all chains, which is shared among token holders. To qualify for the revenue share, holders must hold at least 10 Unibot tokens.\n\nOf the $53 million in cumulative revenue the bot has generated, $48.2 million has been realised on the Ethereum deployment.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

ETH cleared the $3,950 level and traded close to the $4,000 resistance zone. It traded to a new multi-month high above $3,990 and recently started a consolidation phase.\n\nThere was a pullback below the $3,920 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,211 swing low to the $3,9983 high. Ethereum price is now consolidating near $3,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is also a short-term breakout pattern forming with resistance at $3,950 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

If there is a move above the $4,120 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,220 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,350.\n\nAre Dips Limited In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,950 resistance, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,600 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,211 swing low to the $3,9983 high. The next key support could be the $3,400 zone. A clear move below the $3,400 support might send the price toward $3,250. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,800\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,950"

        "title": "Ethereum surges past $4,000 for the second time in its history - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price neared the $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2021 on March 8, 2024. As of March 11, it has gone past $4,000, the second time in the entire price history of Ethereum. The upward movement in Ether's price seems to be fueled by anticipation surrounding Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade and the potential approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\n\nAs of writing, ETH is holding down at $4,010 and continues to be on the rise, while other major cryptocurrencies are also displaying positive sentiment, with Bitcoin at $71,085.\n\n\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, considered the most substantial enhancement to the Ethereum network since the merger, aims to incorporate several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, which introduces \"proto-danksharding.\"\n\n\n\nProto-danksharding is a feature designed to enhance transaction processing by utilising blobs, thereby expediting transactions and reducing costs for layer-2 chains and rollups dependent on Ethereum. The Ethereum developers have scheduled the Dencun mainnet launch for March 13.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is optimism about the SEC's potential approval of spot Ether ETF applications. It's expected that the SEC will announce its decision on all spot Ether ETF applications simultaneously, similar to its approach with Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, to maintain fairness among issuers. The statutory deadline for the SEC's decision on ETFs is set for May 23.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the SEC's decision-making process for Ether ETFs won't be as prolonged as it was for Bitcoin ETFs. Drawing from the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11, a spot Ether ETF product is anticipated to attract significant capital inflow into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that institutional investors may increase their exposure to Ether once attention shifts from Bitcoin's recent all-time high to the potential of an ETH ETF. This could lead to liquidity consolidating at higher levels, potentially triggering price rallies in the long term. With the potential for increased institutional interest and capital inflow, Ethereum's position as the second-largest cryptocurrency is poised for further growth.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has been rallying rapidly over the last few weeks, breaking past several resistance levels. Yet, the price has reached a significant level that could hold the market for a while.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been steadily rising, making higher highs and lows. The market has left the 200-day moving average far behind, a behavior typically seen during crypto bull markets.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price is trying to pierce through the $4,000 resistance level after failing to do so last week.\n\nIf the breakout occurs, ETH will likely reach a new all-time high. However, judging by the massive overbought signals on the RSI, a pullback looks pretty probable in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has been consolidating below the $4,000 level for a while. Yet, the bullish momentum has seemingly kicked in again, and ETH is on the verge of blowing past the $4,000 resistance zone.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index also shows values above 50% but is still not overbought in this timeframe. Therefore, the market might still rise higher before an eventual correction.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rate\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has yet to reach a new all-time high, market participants expect the price to rally much higher. This optimistic behavior can easily be witnessed in future market sentiment.\n\nThis chart presents the Ethereum funding rates, which indicate whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their orders more aggressively on aggregate. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, while negative values point to pessimism by market participants.\n\nThe chart demonstrates that the funding rates have been showing extremely high values recently, even higher than during the last all-time high. While this aggregate buying pressure is not inherently bad, it can lead to a potential long-liquidation cascade that could cause short-term price drops."

        "content": "In case you\u2019re under any illusions, crypto is back, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has given it a huge regulatory boost.\n\nThe LSE announced today that it will start accepting applications for the admission of bitcoin and ether crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the second quarter of this year.\n\nETNs are debt securities that provide exposure to an underlying asset. Crypto ETNs enable investors to trade securities that track cryptoassets on-exchange during London trading hours, and they are traded on their own dedicated trading segments.\n\nConditions for LSE admission\n\nAccording to a factsheet published by the LSE, the Exchange will only consider applications for admission in respect of Crypto ETNs where the issuer can demonstrate:\n\nThe proposed Crypto ETN is physically backed, has a reliable and publicly available market price or other value measure of the underlying, and has Bitcoin or Ethereum underlying crypto assets.\n\nThe underlying cryptoassets must be wholly or principally held in \u2018cold storage\u2019 or subject to arrangements that achieve an equivalent outcome to cold storage and held by a custodian or custodians subject to AML regulation in the UK, EU (or EEA, where equivalent laws apply), Jersey, Switzerland, or US.\n\nFurther, crypto ETNs admitted to trading on LSE are only appropriate for professionals and are only available under trading segments specifically designated as \u201cProfessional investors only.\u201d\n\nAccording to the LSE, \u201cthe exact launch date will be confirmed in due course.\u201d\n\nStill, it encourages early engagement from prospective issuers interested in admitting Crypto ETNs to trading on the Exchange.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated today that it will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a UK-listed market segment for crypto asset-backed Exchange Traded Notes (cETNs).\n\nIt specifies that:\n\n\u201cExchanges will need to continue to ensure sufficient controls are in place, so trading is orderly and proper protection is afforded to professional investors. ETNs must meet all the requirements of the UK Listing Regime, for example on prospectuses and on-going disclosure.\u201d\n\nThe LSE\u2019s move follows the SEC's approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to be listed on US exchanges in January.\n\nLead image: \"London Stock Exchange\" by jam_90s is licensed under CC BY 2.0."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nU.Today has prepared the top three news stories over the past day.\n\nEthereum ETF approval odds plummet, here's why\n\nAccording to data provided by Polymarket , the odds of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) dropped to 24% . The pessimistic analysis follows the agency's recent delay in its decision regarding Ethereum ETF proposals from BlackRock and Fidelity, with the final deadline being postponed to May 23. In a recent X post , Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett noted a major change in sentiment regarding the SEC's stance on Ethereum ETFs. Based on Terrett's conversations with insiders, the regulator spearheaded by Chairman Gary Gensler seems to be less involved in discussions about Ethereum ETFs compared to their Bitcoin analogues, which may indicate that it is content with the progress achieved with Bitcoin ETF approvals. Another factor that appears to be influencing the SEC's approach to Ethereum products is political pressure from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have voiced dissatisfaction with the agency's approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) whales disappear as large transactions plummet\n\nData shared by IntoTheBlock demonstrates that Shiba Inu is witnessing a notable decline in whale transactions , with their value dropping by 14%. Whale transactions are often considered a crucial sign of financial activity on crypto markets since these large holders have the power to affect prices with their sizable trades. If this activity decreases, it may indicate that whales are either taking profits and exiting their positions or reallocating their investments to other assets. Even though the dwindling of whale movements may be viewed as a negative trend, it is not always harmful. Whales frequently sell their holdings in order to realize gains, particularly following a big price surge like the one that SHIB recently had. This whale sell-off behavior can help stabilize prices following volatile times, fostering a more stable and less manipulable market environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBullish Bitcoin price prediction hinted at by Samson Mow, hold tight"

        "content": "Last week, Ethereum attempted a surge past $4,000 levels, however, faced selling pressure at this point and has partially retraced back. At press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price is trading 2% down at $3,866 with a market cap of $464 billion. All eyes are currently on the Etheruem Dencun upgrade scheduled to go live on the mainnet ahead of this week. However, the optimism around spot Ethereum ETF seems to waning down with time.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely?\n\nFox Business Journalist Eleanor Terret shared her observations stating that optimism surrounding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before May 23rd appears to be diminishing.\n\nadvertisement\n\nConversations with knowledgeable individuals indicate that recent meetings have been largely one-sided, with issuers and custodians actively pushing the SEC staff to expedite the process. However, it seems that the SEC staff have not been as responsive or engaged in meaningful discussions compared to their handling of spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nTerret further added that SEC chairman Gary Gensler perceives that he has already satisfied industry demands with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Furthermore, prominent anti-crypto politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren are reportedly displeased with the SEC\u2019s decision to greenlight Bitcoin ETFs and are actively opposing the possibility of Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nThe sources said: \u201cStaff has been very hard to gauge on this and we\u2019re not sure if anyone really knows what\u2019s going on in their heads. But they\u2019re going to have to start work soon if it\u2019s going to have a shot.\u201d\n\nNo Strong Correlation Between ETH spot and Futures ETF\n\nEric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg, noted that the U.S. SEC staff has not provided any feedback to the issuer of the Ethereum spot ETF application, contrasting with their involvement during the Bitcoin spot ETF evaluation.\n\nThis lack of engagement is viewed unfavorably, especially considering the notable correlation between Bitcoin spot and future ETF approvals. However, the correlation between Ethereum spot and future ETFs is not as robust, suggesting a potentially less optimistic outlook for Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum price has witnessed some pullback, analysts are optimistic about the ETH rally to continue going further. As reported, analysts see a minimum gain of an additional 25% in Ethereum all the way to $5,000. However, post the Dencun Upgrade, it will be interesting to see how the bulls sustain the momentum.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

ETNs are debt securities that track an underlying asset but are traded and settled through a central market entity like a stock exchange and securities depository.\n\nThe news helped push bitcoin and ethereum higher. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, hit $72,000 for the first time while ethereum touched $4,000 for the first time since December 2021.\n\nThe UK had become one of the last major markets to hold out against the trading of crypto-related securities, even though the government has been championing the country as a potential centre for digital asset markets.\n\nIn 2021 the FCA banned crypto-related derivatives, which included exchange traded products, owing to concerns over the amount of leverage, or borrowing, available to consumers. Some operators offered as much as 100 times leverage on bitcoin.\n\nThe ban \u2014 which also covered unleveraged securities \u2014 has drawn sharp criticism from members of the crypto industry, who argue that the UK cannot become a leading market for digital assets unless retail investors are given regulated and easy routes into popular tokens such as bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is by far the most well-known crypto asset, and for it to be very difficult for the UK public to be able to buy it, how can we claim to be a crypto hub if we only offer risky ways of buying this asset?\u201d said Tim Lowe, strategic adviser at London-based institutional staking firm Attestant.\n\nRegulators in other major markets have become increasingly comfortable with investors buying crypto-linked securities, as long as the securities are in a regulated product.\n\nAt the start of the year the US approved spot bitcoin ETFs, following countries in the EU, Australia and Canada. Hong Kong has also signalled it will approve ETNs. The newly approved group of US spot bitcoin ETFs, including ones issued by BlackRock and Fidelity, have collectively pulled $10bn since their launch in January, according to crypto investment group CoinShares.\n\n\u201cWith increased insight and data due to a longer period of trading history, the FCA believes exchanges and professional investors should now be able to better establish whether crypto-ETNs meet their risk appetite,\u201d the regulator said in a statement.\n\nIt continues to believe \u201cthat crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. As a result, the ban on the sale of ETNs . . . to retail consumers remains in place.\u201d\n\nThe LSE said that securities behind the ETNs could not be leveraged. They must be kept in an offline storage vault and held by custodians subject to anti-money laundering rules in the UK, EU, Jersey, the US and Switzerland."

Despite a slight increase of 0.42%, ETH tested the $4,000 price level on that day.\n\nAt the time of this writing, it was trading at around $3,900, reflecting a 0.7% increase.\n\nEthereum continued to maintain a strong bull trend at press time, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

A decisive action to save the flagship of the crypto ecosystem before it\u2019s engulfed by the raging waters of the next quantum revolution.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Operation Renaissance\n\nIt was Vitalik Buterin, the visionary behind Ethereum, who lit the fuse. An emergency plan will be put in place to secure the network \u2013 a hard fork of a magnitude equal to the threat it faces.\n\nThe first crucial step: to completely disable transactions from the classic wallets. Too vulnerable to quantum attacks. Instead, new \u201csmart\u201d wallets will take over. Built upon the very structure of the Ethereum blockchain, they will benefit from crypto armor resistant to the capabilities of these future quantum monsters.\n\nBut the cornerstone of this renaissance operation lies in the integration of STARK proofs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge). A mechanism that will enable users to reliably verify their ownership of assets without having to expose their private keys, even to the verification system itself. A cutting-edge cryptographic breakthrough.\n\nA transitional mechanism will also be deployed to allow holders to safely migrate their funds to this new fortified system. A renaissance that will not come without pain for users, forced to undergo a lengthy software update process. But it is a necessary sacrifice on the altar of resilience against the existential threat posed by quantum computers.\n\nToday, Ethereum once again defies the doubts of skeptics to lead the way to a new post-quantum world. Where digital ownership will withstand the onslaught of mass destruction weapons that will be quantum computers. A new era that remains science fiction for now, but towards which the leading network of the blockchain is advancing, prepared for battle.

        "content": "With the recent approval of Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, attention has now shifted to the possibility of an Ethereum [ETH] ETF.\n\nHowever, unlike its counterpart, the path to approval for ETH ETFs remains uncertain, leaving the market speculating about a potential timeline.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has offered no clear indication of whether the commission will approve a spot Ether ETF anytime soon.\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Gensler avoided directly addressing the question, opting not to prejudge any filings.\n\nHe noted,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudge anyone filing, and as you said, there are ten filings in front of us.\u201d\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cSo, news alert, I\u2019m not going to prejudge that. But to your question, we look at the facts and circumstances and that which was in front of us.\u201d\n\nWill ETH ETF receive similar validation?\n\nAmidst the anticipation surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF, major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are already vying for a spot in the market.\n\nDespite optimism fueled by the presence of ether futures ETFs and Grayscale\u2019s past success against the SEC, Bloomberg\u2019s senior analyst Eric Balchunas warns that the SEC\u2019s silence could signal potential hurdles.\n\nEric highlighted,\n\n\u201cNormally I\u2019d say this was good sign but as far as I know the Staff has not given any comments yet to the issuers, which is not a good sign as we past when they gave comments on btc ETFs.\u201d\n\nNotably, while Gensler remained ambiguous about the ETH ETF approval, his disapproval of the crypto industry was evident, despite his role in the recent Bitcoin ETF vote.\n\nThe future of ETFs\n\nIn the interview, Gensler criticized the crypto industry for widespread fraud and abuse, pointing to recent bankruptcies.\n\nHe slammed intermediaries for not disclosing how they handle investors\u2019 money, comparing their actions to things that wouldn\u2019t be allowed on traditional stock exchanges.\n\nWith the potential approval of an ETH ETF looming, there\u2019s speculation that it could open doors for broader acceptance of similar crypto ETFs in traditional finance.\n\nHowever, Gensler\u2019s conspicuous silence on the SEC\u2019s stance hints at a complex approval process ahead, leaving investors and market participants in anticipation."

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen its price hover stubbornly below the $4,000 mark in recent days, despite registering over 10% gains in the past week. This consolidation phase has analysts pondering whether it\u2019s a healthy pause before further ascension or a sign of a potential correction.\n\nETH/USD Technical Analysis Paints a Mixed Picture\n\nLooking at the ETH/USD technical indicators:\n\nResistance: The immediate hurdle for ETH bulls lies at the $3,850 level. A decisive break above this point could propel the price towards $4,000 and potentially higher.\n\nSupport: The first line of defense in case of a pullback sits at $3,740. A clear breach below this level could see ETH revisit the $3,650 zone or even the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally, around $3,550.\n\nMoving Averages: The 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are currently acting as dynamic support for ETH prices, indicating a short-term bullish bias.\n\nMomentum Indicators: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the hourly chart is losing some momentum in the bullish zone, suggesting a potential slowdown in the upward trend. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above 50, signifying that the market isn\u2019t yet overbought.\n\nPossible Reasons for Consolidation in Ethereum Price\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to ETH\u2019s current consolidation:\n\nProfit-taking: After a significant weekly rally, some investors might be taking profits, leading to a temporary price pullback.\n\nWider market correction: If the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a correction, ETH could be dragged down along with it.\n\nMacroeconomic factors: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising interest rates, could dampen investor sentiment across riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nLatest Developments to Know Before Trading Ethereum\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Approval Delays: Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret reported diminishing optimism surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23rd. Her sources suggest a lack of engagement from the SEC staff compared to Bitcoin ETF applications. Additionally, prominent anti-crypto politicians are reportedly opposing Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Quantum Readiness: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed confidence in the platform\u2019s ability to counter a potential quantum computing attack through a hard fork and new transaction types. This would involve a network rollback and user software updates to protect existing wallets.\n\nDeFi Resurgence: The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has seen a significant uptick, reaching a $100 billion total value locked (TVL) for the first time since May 2022. Ethereum maintains its dominance in DeFi with a 59% market share. Lido, an Ethereum-based staking protocol, remains the leader with $39 billion TVL.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe next few days will be crucial for determining the direction of ETH\u2019s price. A sustained break above $3,850 could signal a continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a drop below $3,740 with increasing selling pressure could indicate a more significant correction."

        "title": "JPMorgan credits Ethereum for Crypto boost; Whales favoring this new AI Altcoin over Solana - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "Analysts at global investment bank JPMorgan have noted three primary catalysts for the crypto boost, naming Ethereum (ETH) as a significant reason for the surge in crypto retail interest. The altcoin\u2019s contributions are highlighted by two impending yet substantial developments within its ecosystem: the Dencun upgrade and the prospective approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. Whale interest in the new AI altcoin InQubeta (QUBE) rises as market sentiment for Solana (SOL) drops.\n\nWith a promising price entry and a prevalent recommended presale, InQubeta is attracting institutional investors. This gem coin merges the blockchain and artificial intelligence industries, guaranteeing a unique and revolutionary crowdfunding model. This article explores Ethereum\u2019s role in the crypto boom and the rising whale interest in the Solana competitor.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Attracting Whales with NFT-backed features\n\nInQubeta is a top-rated AI token on the decentralized cryptocurrency list with impressive features that attract investors to the platform. This ICO offers a crowdfunding model backed by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ensuring all willing participants can hold equity in AI tech startups without needing a considerable budget. Equity in these startups is minted into trending NFTs that are fractionated, allowing investors to own blocks in different projects, thereby diversifying their portfolios and reaping immense rewards from the growth of these startups.\n\nInQubeta is set to clear the eighth stage of its recommended presale as more whales gain interest in the token. Less than 9% of this stage is left, selling at $0.0245 per token, after which the price will increase to $0.028 apiece. The presale has recently hit the $11 million milestone as more tokens are purchased daily and whales buy in bulk. Over 861 million QUBE tokens have been sold, with investors looking to claim substantial returns upon launch.\n\nThis blockchain ICO is topping the decentralized cryptocurrency list with a deflationary token burn model that aims to reduce the supply of tokens in circulation, raising demand and market value over time. A buy-and-sell tax imposed on transactions within the platform funds a dedicated pool that rewards users who stake their QUBE tokens, further reducing supply and raising demand. From trading NFTs to offering exciting opportunities for diversified earnings and passive income, InQubeta continues to thrill investors, welcoming whales to purchase its presale at discounted rates.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Pushing the Crypto market with exciting developments\n\nAccording to JPMorgan analysts, the Ethereum network is credited with two of the three catalysts that will drive crypto prices over the coming months. The team, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a top-rated market strategist, has noted that the revival of retail impulse in February reflects market anticipation for the Bitcoin halving event, the Dencun upgrade, and the possible spot ETH ETF approvals. While the first two catalysts are priced in, the spot ETH ETF approval only has a 50% chance based on their on-chain data analysis.\n\nThe major upcoming upgrade for Ethereum, Dencun, is set to be released on March 13th. The upgrade merges Cancun and Deneb, two more minor upgrades on the network. It focuses on the execution and consensus layers of the network to enhance scalability, efficiency, and security while significantly reducing transaction fees on layer 2. The decision regarding the SEC approval for the spot ETH ETFs is expected to be made in May, but skepticism remains as the SEC Chairman has yet to clarify whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity.\n\nSolana (SOL): Continued defiance among top Altcoins\n\nAnticipation for a Solana rally is rising as the token maintains an upward trend, even with expectations of a market reversal for altcoins following recent pullbacks. Its charts indicate a solid bullish trend, as analysts note a series of high lows and higher highs. Following its week-long rally, analysis of the token\u2019s on-chain data predicts a promising trajectory in March, putting SOL within reach of possibly hitting its all-time high of $259.96.\n\nSOL-based products, particularly its decentralized exchanges (DEXes), have witnessed increased user interest. The project\u2019s DEXes have had their most productive week as DeFiLlama\u2019s data, analyzed by AMBCrypto, signified a cumulative volume of $11.24 billion between February 25th and March 2nd. Solana has surpassed all top smart contract blockchains, including Ethereum, with a total value locked (TVL) that surged by 52% in the past month and a 177% weekly growth rate.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe crypto market is rallying, with a boost credited to Ethereum based on on-chain data analyzed by the JPMorgan team. Whale interest in Solana has dwindled as investors turn to other projects with impressive utility and exciting offerings. The AI altcoin is attracting whale investments with its trending NFTs and revolutionary crowdfunding model. Investors anticipate substantial returns upon launch, as the project has proposed a list price of $0.0308, a 340% increase from its initial cost.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

The PPI shows upward movement, which could have consequences for consumer prices now.\n\nIncreased PPI could be a sign of broadening the market outside the region. Cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, are generally referred to as having the ability to act as an inflation hedge just like other precious traditional assets, such as gold.\n\nTraders and investors in the crypto market are keeping a keen eye on the CPI and PPI data which will then determine the Fed\u2019s potential decision on upcoming rate-hike plans.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade \u2013 March 13\n\nEthereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun Upgrade, set for March 13, marks a significant milestone in the platform\u2019s evolution.\n\nBy integrating \u201cDeneb\u201d with the name of a famous tourist destination \u201cCancun,\u201d the upgrade will lead to improved scalability, security, and network efficiency. Proto-Danksharding and many other EIPs will be introduced, which aim at lowering costs of Layer 2 approaches, improving security measures, and creating a more rewarding staking experience.\n\nEIP-4844 could, conceivably, bring a drastic downfall in Ethereum\u2019s settlement costs quite effectively. This is a significant development in the context of Ethereum\u2019s pursuit of resolving its scalability challenges.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Sentencing \u2013 March 28\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, faces a potential prison sentence of up to 110 years on the 28th of March.\n\nBitcoin Halving \u2013 March \u2013 April\n\nBitcoin halving was predicted to happen earlier on 6th March. Nevertheless, we can expect the Bitcoin halving to take place supposedly around April or May.\n\n\u201cFor the previous halving in 2012 and 2016, the market followed by substantial price rise for bitcoin; a bullish narrative for the 2024 halving came up as the market talk\u201d, indicates Rikke Staer, the CEO of Coinify.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Options and Spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 WHEN?\n\nCryptocurrency traders are anxiously waiting for the arrival of a spot bitcoin ETF options which may be several months away.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC is given a time extension until the end of May to make its decision regarding the first spot ETH ETF applications.\n\nThe green signal to the spot Bitcoin ETFs options and the spot Ethereum ETFs being approved are likely to introduce new dynamics in the crypto market.\n\nRegulatory clarity on spot Bitcoin ETF options and potential spot Ethereum ETFs is a key factor driving investor sentiment in the crypto space.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s interest rate, the sentencing of SBF and the Bitcoin halving to occur in a few weeks are likely to be the main news stories in the crypto industry, affecting traders\u2019 perceptions and strategies."
