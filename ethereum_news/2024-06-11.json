        "content": "Photo: Pixabay\n\nThe US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) recently approved \u201con an accelerated basis\u201d rule-change proposals from three exchanges looking to list spot Ethereum exchange-traded products. Most observers had expected the SEC to reject the applications on the basis that they were filed as commodity ETFs and the SEC deems Ether (or ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform) to be a security.\n\n\u201cThe approval order leverages research from Bitwise and the SEC examining the correlation between spot Ether prices and the price of regulated Ethereum futures contracts,\u201d says Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto index fund manager Bitwise. \u201cThe fact that there is a large, robust and regulated futures market in Ethereum had a big impact on the decision.\u201d\n\nBryan Amour, Morningstar\n\nAnother factor was removal of staking from the filings. Ethereum relies on staking to ensure the security of the network, rewarding users who participate in block production and validation through a portion of newly created ETH.\n\nHigher staked amounts help secure the network further by making it more immune to 51% attacks. A 51% attack is an attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by an entity or group that controls more than 50% of the network and thus can prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations and to reverse non-confirmed transactions.\n\nEthereum"

        "content": "While lagging behind Solana, TON\u2019s daily active addresses have exceeded Ethereum\u2019s figures every day except for one thus far in June. Some believe TON could close the distance in market cap with Solana.\n\nThe price of TON has increased nearly 392% to around $7.40 in the past year, making its market cap stand at $18 billion.\n\nThe Open Network (TON) Blockchain is showing signs it may be the next Solana by virtue of challenging the historical smart contract leader, Ethereum.\n\nDriven by Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet built into every app and the rampant play of mini-games, the TON blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in daily active addresses every day in June except one, a sign of growing popularity for the network connected to Telegram, the popular messaging application with more than 900 million monthly active users.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Artemis, TON has averaged 465,200 daily active addresses in June with a high of 568,300 on June 3, levels Ethereum has not crossed as the latter has yet to see more than 400,000 daily active addresses on its base layer in the month, excluding its various layer 2s.\n\n\u201cFor early ecosystems such as TON, we believe [daily active users] is a better metric to watch than [total value locked] or fees, as gathering users is a higher priority than making money,\u201d wrote Kelly Ye, portfolio manager at liquid venture firm Decentral Park Capital, in her weekly newsletter published on May 20.\n\nDespite having higher levels of daily active addresses than Ethereum, TON\u2019s growing figures still dwindle in comparison to Solana\u2019s which has averaged roughly 1.64 million daily active addresses in June.\n\n\u201cTON is good for the blockchain industry as data shows it\u2019s adding net new activity,\u201d wrote Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at Artemis, in a Telegram message to Unchained. \u201cDaily active addresses on both Solana and TON have increased over the course of the year, indicating TON is onboarding new addresses.\u201d\n\nTON\u2019s Opt-Out Wallet Launches With Massive User Base\n\nTelegram\u2019s built-in community aided by its in-app crypto wallet has helped propel TON\u2019s level of daily active addresses to where it is currently, argued Jehan Chu, an investor in the TON ecosystem and managing partner of blockchain venture capital firm Kenetic.\n\nThe native crypto wallet in Telegram is \u201can opt-out wallet, which means other than the 30 or 40 million US users who are geoblocked, the other 860 million Telegram users all have a crypto wallet natively [and] automatically,\u201d Chu said in a conversation with Unchained. \u201cLet that sink in\u2026 That is Thanos-level kind of change.\u201d\n\nTelegram has been able to scale its technology as well as the onboarding of its large user base through the official rollout of Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet, launched in Sept. 2023. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s not really about wallets. It\u2019s about the seamless integration of web3 technology into where users already are,\u201d namely messaging, \u201cone of the highest traffic destinations for users on a daily basis,\u201d said Chu.\n\n\u201c99.999% of blockchain projects are a tech idea trying to create a community \u2013 from nothing. According to CoinMarketCap there are more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s a hard road for most,\u201d wrote Dan Morehead, CEO of crypto-focused venture firm Pantera, in the company\u2019s May announcement about how TON was its largest investment ever. \u201cTelegram is a community [of over 900 million users] integrating blockchain technology. That\u2019s just got to be easier.\u201d\n\nPantera, which has $4.7 billion in assets under management, cited other reasons in its rationale for investing in TON, including its values as a neutral platform independent of state influence and easy onboarding process.\n\nGames Drive Record Levels of Activity\n\nWhat has driven the recent surge in activity is another factor that led Pantera to its massive investment: an ecosystem of mini-applications which include chatbots and games. Referring to Telegram\u2019s increased levels of daily active addresses, Chu said it arose from \u201ca combination of things \u2013 obviously, games are a big driver.\u201d A number of mini-games within Telegram have attracted substantial attention from its users, such as Notcoin, Hamster Kombat, and Catizen.\n\nNotcoin, a free game on Telegram where over 35 million users have tapped their screens to earn tokens, rolled out its cryptocurrency in May and has since garnered a market cap of $1.6 billion, data from CoinGecko shows. Similarly, Hamster Kombat has nearly 33.6 million subscribers in its Telegram channel, while Catizen has over 3.6 million users.\n\nBloomberg also reported on Tuesday that many in the crypto space believe this trend of mini-games in Telegram \u201ccould be the \u2018killer app\u2019 that will define the current bull market.\u201d\n\nWhile they don\u2019t interact with the TON blockchain, popular trading bots such as BONKbot native to Solana and Banana Gun, which is on Ethereum, depend on Telegram to generate fees from enabling crypto users to trade on their mobile devices. Telegram also has trading bots for the TON blockchain, such as sTONks and TOB Bot.\n\n\u201cWe believe that similar TON-native Telegram bots will become the preferred user experience for many traders,\u201d according to Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera.\n\nThe price of TON has increased nearly 392% to around $7.40 in the past year, bringing its market cap to $18 billion. Despite outpacing the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, BTC and ETH, TON\u2019s price performance this last year is not as strong as Solana\u2019s, whose native token soared 860% in the same period to a market cap of more than $68 billion.\n\nAccording to Decentral Park Capital\u2019s Ye, TON has solid potential \u201cto close the gap in market cap with Solana this cycle.\u201d\n\nCorrection (June 13, 2024 11:14 A.M. EST): The previous title erroneously referred to TON Blockchain as belonging to Telegram. Following the SEC\u2019s ruling, Telegram has no relationship with The Open Network (TON) Blockchain, which is now stewarded by the TON Foundation. Unchained regrets the mistake."

Deploy a high-throughput L2 as *permissionlessly* as a smart contract. pic.twitter.com/74wyw5Xknq \u2014 Celestia (@CelestiaOrg) June 10, 2024\n\nDeveloped by Succinct Labs, Blobstream enables Celestia\u2019s data roots to be streamed to an Ethereum light client on-chain. The solution offers high-throughput data availability (DA) for Ethereum layer 2 solutions (L2s), secured by cryptoeconomic guarantees.\n\n\u201cThis provides permissionless, high-throughput DA to Ethereum L2s, secured by cryptoeconomic guarantees rather than reputation or hidden trust assumptions,\u201d stated Celestia.\n\nPreviously, Ethereum developers faced throughput limitations, prompting them to move to alternative layer 1 networks or rely on centralized services for DA.\n\nBlobstream allows developers to continue their work within the Ethereum ecosystem. Builders can create customizable, high-throughput blockspace without the need for permissions or committees while ensuring security through cryptographic economic guarantees.\n\nApart from the launch, the Celestia team announced that Blobstream on the Ethereum mainnet is now accessible on Celestia\u2019s blockchain explorer Celenium.\n\nAccording to Celestia\u2019s blog announcement, Succinct Labs has introduced Blobstream X, a zero-knowledge (ZK) implementation that streamlines the verification of Celestia validator signatures on-chain with a single ZK proof. This reduces validator overhead, simplifies the Celestia protocol, and accelerates the streaming of data root commitments for Ethereum L2s.\n\nAs noted, both Blobstream and its ZK implementation are currently available on testnet. Following code audits and Celestia\u2019s upcoming launch, the community will be able to deploy Blobstream on Ethereum Mainnet and L2s to enhance streaming DA.\n\nPrior to this deployment, Celestia had already brought Blobstream to Arbitrum Orbit, Starknet, and Base, marking a continuous commitment to improving the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s infrastructure."

        "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has brought attention to a notable trend in the Ethereum market. Over the past three weeks, the number of Ethereum addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH has surged by 3%. This increase indicates a significant spike in buying pressure among large-scale investors, often referred to as \u201cwhales.\u201d\n\nThis uptick in large holders could signal a positive outlook for Ethereum, as increased accumulation by whales often precedes significant price movements. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring these developments, anticipating potential impacts on the broader crypto market.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum\u2019s price stands at $3,698.25, with a 24-hour trading volume of $12.20 billion and a market capitalization of $444.30 billion. Despite this bullish activity among major holders, the ETH price has slightly dropped 0.28% in the past 24 hours.\n\nWill Ethereum Break $4,000 or Drop Below $3,650?\n\nIn a recent analysis, prominent crypto analyst Crypto Patel outlined potential scenarios for Ethereum (ETH) price movements. Patel\u2019s insights delve into both bullish and bearish outcomes, providing a detailed forecast based on current trading patterns.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading within a bull flag or parallel channel pattern against the USDT. This setup typically indicates a period of consolidation before a potential breakout. Traders and investors are keenly observing these patterns to determine their next moves.\n\nAccording to Patel, a bearish scenario could unfold if ETH breaks below the crucial support level of $3,650. Should this happen, Ethereum might experience a significant drop towards $3,152. This level is noteworthy as it represents the last Fair Value Gap (FVG), a region where prices previously moved quickly, leaving little traded volume behind.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum manages to stay above the level of $3,152 support, then it turns into a bullish one. As Patel predicts, following this, ETH can rally up to $4,000 in the meantime. Go past that resistance, and a hugely bullish wave could knock Ether to $6,000-$7,000.\n\nCrypto Patel\u2019s analysis reiterates the importance of vigilance on important support and resistance levels in this existing trading scenario. Traders must remain alert and change their strategies according to these potential breakout points.\n\nRelated Reading | DOGE Enters Key Wyckoff Phase: Major Spike Predicted Amid Market Volatility"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a significant development on the crypto market, crypto exchange Coinbase has witnessed the largest Ethereum (ETH) outflow of the year, amounting to over $1 billion. This massive movement, reported by CryptoQuant, has sparked discussions and speculations about its potential implications for ETH and the broader market.\n\nCryptoQuant's data reveals that more than 336,000 ETH were withdrawn from the trading platform, totaling an approximate value of $1.17 billion on June 12, 2024. This event marks the fifth instance in 2024 where withdrawals from Coinbase have exceeded 150,000 ETH. The range of these transactions has varied from $400 million to $1.1 billion, indicating the involvement of substantial market participants.\n\nWho's behind withdrawals?\n\nThe scale and frequency of these withdrawals suggest that they are not driven by individual Ethereum traders . Instead, the transactions are likely the actions of whales or unknown institutional players. This assumption aligns with the observation that such large-scale movements are typically beyond the capacity of retail traders and are more characteristic of significant entities with major holdings and strategic market positions.\n\nThe exact reasons behind this enormous withdrawal remain speculative. However, historical patterns and market behaviors provide some insights. Similar large-scale withdrawals were observed on Coinbase for Bitcoin (BTC) before the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year. This has led to speculation that the current ETH outflow might be driven by anticipation of potential Ethereum spot ETFs in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPositive indicators for long term\n\nIf these withdrawals are not merely internal movements by the exchange, they could signal a positive indicator for Ethereum's long-term prospects. Reducing the circulating supply of ETH, particularly in such large quantities, can create scarcity, leading to upward pressure on its price. This supply-demand dynamic is a fundamental principle on asset markets and is especially pertinent on a volatile and sentiment-driven crypto market."

        "content": "Ethereum is termed the \"digital oil\" of the digital future by the world's largest bank, ICBC.\n\nSEC is yet to provide feedback on ETH ETF S-1s despite expectations of the agency's comments earlier on Friday.\n\nEthereum's recent sell-off may be temporary, considering bullish events on the horizon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down over 6% on Tuesday as the general crypto market is trending downward. Despite the bearish sentiment, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China has commended Ethereum's growth, describing it as \"digital oil.\"\n\nDaily digest market movers: SEC stays mute, ICBC commends ETH\n\nIn a recent report, the world's largest bank, the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), hailed the growth of Ethereum and Bitcoin. While comparing Bitcoin to Gold due to its scarcity, the bank also termed Ethereum \"digital oil,\" noting its role in \"providing a strong platform\" for supporting a host of Web3 innovations.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum ecosystem sees impressive Q1 earnings, issuers plan to market ETH as the \u2018ultimate app store\u2019\n\n\"Ethereum has been continuously upgrading its technology in terms of security, scalability and sustainability, providing technical power for the digital future,\" the report states.\n\nMeanwhile, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to respond to prospective spot ETH ETF issuers on Tuesday, more than one week after they filed their S-1 registration statements on May 31. Issuers had expected the agency to comment on their filings on June 7. However, they have yet to get any feedback and now expect the SEC to provide comments this week, a source told The Block. According to Nate Geraci, issuers will file another round of amendments after they receive the SEC's comment.\n\nThe SEC approved spot ETH ETF 19b-4 filings of issuers on May 23. Before spot ETH ETFs can begin trading though, the agency must approve the issuers' S-1 registration statements. SEC Chair Gary Gensler told Reuters last week that the timing of the S-1 approval depends on how fast issuers respond to the agency's comments.\n\nRead more: Ethereum's price suffers slight decline amid Hong Kong's plan to allow staking in ETH ETFs\n\nWhile the wait continues, issuers have stated that they plan to market the ETFs as a \u201cproducing tech stock\u201d or the \u201cultimate app store.\u201d\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum's recent setback may be temporary\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,490, down over 6% on Tuesday. The market appears to be in risk-off mode ahead of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and Federal Open Market Committee decision on June 12, according to QCP Capital.\n\nThe market decline has accelerated ETH liquidations, with long liquidations accounting for $48.39 million of a total of $52.58 liquidations in the past 24 hours.\n\nAlso read: Is Ethereum price forming a local top?\n\nETH open interest (OI) has declined by about $680 million between Friday and Tuesday. Specifically, ETH options OI also reduced by $1.21 billion in the same time range. Coupled with declining options volume, this confirms the bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nETH has breached the $3,618 support and is looking to extend the downward move below the $3,457 price level. With spot ETH ETFs on the horizon, the current sell-off may prove to be a temporary setback and a good accumulation zone. A further plunge below the $3,300 support will strengthen the bearish trend."

        "content": "Issuers of prospective spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are still in limbo, waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide feedback on their S-1 filings. According to two sources, these drafts were initially submitted on May 31, with the issuers anticipating comments from the SEC by June 7. Yet, at least two issuers have reported receiving no feedback as of now. One source mentioned that they now expect the SEC\u2019s comments to arrive later this week.\n\nThis delay follows a statement by SEC Chair Gary Gensler on CNBC, where he indicated that the approval process for the S-1 forms would \u201ctake some time.\u201d The uncertainty over the timeline remains, with one source previously suggesting that the S-1 forms might need at least two more rounds of draft filings before being ready for final approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Launching Process\n\nThe path to launching these spot Ethereum ETFs involves a two-step process. The initial step was the approval of the 19b-4 forms, which was completed on May 23. The current focus is on the S-1 filings, which, once approved, will pave the way for the ETFs to start trading.\n\nThe draft filings have revealed some intriguing details about the upcoming products. Notably, BlackRock is seeding its ETF with $10 million, indicating strong initial capital backing. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton has outlined a competitive fee structure, planning to charge a 0.19% fee.\n\nAs the market eagerly awaits the launch of these spot Ethereum ETFs, a significant question lingers: Can they replicate the success of the spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, Jag Kooner, offers a tempered outlook, estimating that the Ethereum ETFs will attract around 10-20% of the inflows that have been directed towards their Bitcoin counterparts.\n\nThe potential launch of these Ethereum ETFs marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market, offering investors a new avenue to gain exposure to Ethereum. However, the timeline remains uncertain as issuers and investors alike wait for the SEC\u2019s next move. The ongoing wait underscores the regulatory complexities involved in bringing innovative financial products to market, reflecting the cautious approach of the SEC in navigating the evolving landscape of digital assets."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, June 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market is rife with opportunities and evolving narratives.

        "content": "The Open Network a.k.a TON has recorded a surge in its daily active addresses count surpassing those of Ethereum, thanks to Telegram\u2019s 900 million user base. Despite its fledgling ecosystem, TON\u2019s steady growth looks promising, driven largely by the immense distribution power of Telegram. Despite these positive indicators, questions remain about whether its growth is sustainable and if it can emerge as a challenge to bigger rivals such as Ethereum in the long run.\n\nThe Flippening CT ignores TON\u2019s quiet growth, fueled by Telegram\u2019s 900M user base, which has driven its daily active addresses above Ethereum. At its core, the token is a bet on Telegram\u2019s distribution. Though the ecosystem is nascent, its early growth is promising. But is it enough?\n\nTON\u2019s Daily Users Beat Ethereum 3\n\nAs critics point to the ecosystem\u2019s nascent stage, its initial adoption metrics are impressive. The token had a blistering rally this year, exceeding Bitcoin\u2019s price by roughly 120%. Apart from this, TON led the altcoin pack with a remarkable surge of 110% growth in non-empty wallets over the past six months. Bitcoin may have the most non-empty wallets, but the altcoin\u2019s growth is the fastest in this category. This surge in wallet activity positions TON as a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market, showcasing increasing interest and engagement from investors and users alike.\n\nWith a net change of 16.8K wallets, the token has seen exponential growth in its user base, indicating growing confidence in the project and its underlying technology. This surge comes amidst a broader trend of heightened interest in cryptocurrencies, fueled by increased institutional adoption, growing mainstream acceptance, and evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nTON\u2019s Silent Surge\n\nHowever, the latest surge can be due to several factors. Firstly, the integration with Telegram provides an enormous built-in user base, which facilitates easier adoption and use of TON\u2019s services. Secondly, the simplicity and efficiency of TON\u2019s blockchain, designed to handle high transaction volumes with low fees, appeal to users looking for an alternative to Ethereum\u2019s often congested and expensive network.\n\nWith Telegram\u2019s backing, the token has a unique advantage in terms of user reach and engagement. If the network can capitalize on this foundation and continue to grow its ecosystem, it could emerge as a formidable player in the crypto space. In conclusion, while TON\u2019s quiet rise might have been overlooked by many, the underlying trends suggest a significant shift in the crypto landscape."

        "title": "Is Ethereum price forming a local top? - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price struggles to surpass the $4,000 mark.\n\nOn-chain data suggests that the short-term whales are booking profits.\n\nETH development activity and active addresses slow down.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price faces struggles to surpass the $4,000 barrier. On-chain data reveals that investors appear to be capitalizing on gains, contributing to the emergence of a potential local peak. This situation can be seen in the decreasing ETH development activity and a corresponding slowdown in active wallet addresses, suggesting a pivotal moment in the trajectory of Ethereum's price journey.\n\nEthereum whale activity\n\nData from CryptoQuant's 7-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio reveals the relative aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers. A value above one suggests buyer dominance, while a value below one indicates aggressive selling.\n\nThe chart below reveals that the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has remained below one and has been declining sharply in recent days. This indicates that most futures traders are aggressively selling Ethereum, either for speculative reasons or to take profits. This significant drop in the metric is a bearish signal, suggesting the current downward retracement in ETH could persist if this trend continues and a local top forms.\n\nETH Taker Buy Sell Ratio chart\n\nSantiment\u2019s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator provides daily network-level Return On Investment (ROI) data based on a coin\u2019s on-chain transaction volume, offering insights into market sentiment. Sharp spikes in a coin\u2019s NPL suggest holders are selling at significant profits, while steep dips indicate holders are realizing losses, potentially signaling panic sell-offs and investor capitulation.\n\nFor ETH, the NPL indicator spiked from 36.69 million on June 10 to 1.06 billion on June 11. This positive trend suggests holders are selling at significant profits, hinting at the formation of local tops.\n\nETH Network Realized Profit/Loss chart\n\nSantiment\u2019s data of Active Addresses indicates the number of unique addresses that participate in transactions on a blockchain or cryptocurrency network within a given day. This metric is used to gauge the level of network activity and user engagement. Higher Active Addresses typically suggest increased usage and interest in the cryptocurrency, whereas lower Active Addresses mean weakening demand and diminished confidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\nAs in ETH\u2019s case, the number of Active Addresses is decreasing constantly, from 644,950 addresses on March 20 to 450,000 addresses on June 11. This 30% fall in Active Addresses indicates weakening demand and diminished confidence in ETH.\n\nETH Active Addresses chart\n\nSantiment\u2019s Development Activity indicates project development activity over time based on a number of pure development-related events in the project's public GitHub repository.\n\nAn increase in metric typically signals ongoing efforts to maintain, innovate, and enhance the protocol, which investors and stakeholders view positively. Conversely, a decrease in the index may trigger concerns regarding the project's sustainability, innovation capacity, and community involvement over the long term.\n\nIn ETH\u2019s case, a sharp fall in the index from 329 on May 19 to 270 on June 11 implies that Ethereum's developing activity is constantly decreasing, signals concerns regarding the project's sustainability, innovation capacity, and community involvement over the long term, which adds further credence to the bearish outlook.\n\n\n\nETH Development Activity chart\n\nAnalyzing the declining Taker Buy Sell Ratio, surging Network Realized Profit/Loss, dwindling Development Activity, and diminishing Active Addresses collectively implies a potential local top for Ethereum's price. Nonetheless, a shift in market sentiment fueled by positive US CPI news this Wednesday, coupled with significant institutional investment inflow into Ethereum spot ETFs, has the potential to negate the bearish outlook and propel ETH towards retesting its all-time high at $4,878."

Sign up to receive the latest stablecoin news, content and availability: https://t.co/ifguG77bO6 \u2014 Ripple (@Ripple) June 12, 2024\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also described RLUSD as \u201cReal USD.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name of the Ripple stablecoin [is] RLUSD; I like to call it Real USD or Ripple USD,\u201d said Garlinghouse at the XRP Ledger Apex 2024 this week.\n\nPegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, RLUSD will be fully backed by a combination of USD, short-term US Government bonds, and cash equivalent assets, as previously reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nWith the new product, Ripple aims to diversify its stablecoin offerings. In addition, the company expects to enhance support for DeFi applications, including AMM exchanges, by providing a reliable asset solution.\n\nThe announcement follows Ripple\u2019s recent acquisition of Standard Custody and the appointment of its CEO, Jack McDonald, as Senior Vice President overseeing the stablecoin division yesterday.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple has chosen Axelar\u2019s interoperability platform for its XRPL EVM sidechain, favoring its user-friendly approach over the previously considered XLS-38 bridge. The company said Axelar\u2019s integration with prominent projects and its security features were key factors in this decision.\n\n3/ We're migrating to @axelarnetwork for its robust security and efficiency in cross-chain transactions. \"Axelar is a battle-tested, production-ready bridge to bring XRP as a native currency to the XRPL EVM Sidechain.\u201d \u2014 @FerranPrat12, @Peersyst CEO. \u2014 RippleX (@RippleXDev) June 12, 2024\n\nDespite recent progress, RLUSD has faced regulatory roadblocks. In a legal document filed in May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims that Ripple\u2019s proposed stablecoin is an unregistered crypto asset. According to the SEC, the stablecoin is evidence that Ripple might keep doing things that violate securities laws."

        "content": "MetaMask users can now stake small amounts of Ether through the wallet.\n\nThe new offering charges higher fees than market leader Lido.\n\nMetaMask is going all in on the $116 billion market in Ethereum staking.\n\nConsensys, the firm behind the top crypto wallet, announced Wednesday the launch of Pooled Staking, a new offering that will let those with small amounts of Ether pool their tokens and earn staking rewards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple way to be rewarded for contributing to the security of Ethereum,\u201d Matthieu Saint Olive, a senior product manager at Consensys, told DL News. \u201cThis solution will be competitive.\u201d\n\nPreviously, only users with 32 Ether could stake through MetaMask.\n\nThe Pooled Staking launch puts MetaMask on an equal footing with other staking providers that accept small amounts of Ether for staking.\n\nBut it could be an uphill battle for MetaMask to break into this highly-competitive market.\n\nSaint Olive said MetaMask will charge Pooled Staking users 15% of their staking rewards for its service \u2014 much higher than leading Ethereum staking provider Lido\u2019s 10%.\n\nThe market for Ethereum staking is huge. Almost 33 million Ether tokens worth $116 billion are staked on the blockchain, earning at least 3.1% per year, paid in Ether.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLido dominates the market, accounting for almost 29% of all Ether staked.\n\nLido dominates the Ethereum staking market. (Dune Analytics/@hildobby)\n\nBy providing a more accessible option to MetaMask users, Consensys is hoping its Pooled Staking feature can compete against dozens of other options, many of which, like Lido, offer lower fees.\n\nStaking fees\n\nStaking on Ethereum is complex.\n\nIt requires in-depth technical knowledge, a stable internet connection, and a minimum of 32 Ether \u2014 worth $113,000. Mistakes can cause significant financial losses.\n\nBecause of this, many Ethereum users choose to stake through a third party provider.\n\nStaking providers usually take a percentage of rewards \u2014 between 10% and 25% \u2014 in exchange for helping their users stake.\n\nAt the low end, Lido, Binance Staked ETH, and Mantle Staked ETH charge a 10% fee on staking rewards.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Wrapped Staked ETH sits on the high end, charging 25%.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s 15% Pooled Staking fee, Saint Olive says, falls somewhere in the middle.\n\n\u201cUsers care more about the rewards they actually receive, and how secure the solution is, rather than the provider fee itself,\u201d Saint Olive said.\n\nSecurity and convenience\n\nThe new offering may appeal to more casual crypto users because of its convenience.\n\nMetaMask users can start staking their Ether via the wallet\u2019s interface.\n\nHowever, MetaMask also gives users the option to stake through rival staking providers Lido and Rocket Pool \u2014 both of which offer lower staking fees \u2014 through the same interface.\n\nAs for security, Pooled Staking will use the same staking system used by Consensys Staking, the firm\u2019s enterprise-grade staking product.\n\nConsensys says it has received third-party security certifications for both Consensys Staking and MetaMask.\n\nConsensys Staking has 33,000 Ethereum validators with more than 1 million Ether staked, equivalent to 3.3% of all staked Ether, according to the Pooled Staking announcement.\n\nEven so, it says it has never had one of its validators get slashed.\n\nSlashing is when the Ethereum network takes Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish data when they are supposed to, or don\u2019t publish the correct data.\n\nIn November, Bitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, suffered a $200,000 loss after nearly 100 of its validators were slashed for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nIn October, 20 of Lido\u2019s validators were also slashed, costing the protocol $45,000.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "In the NFT market, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) took center stage with revenues exceeding $4.27 million. The Ethereum Name Service uses NFT technology in its decentralized URL method on the Ethereum blockchain, even though it isn\u2019t an NFT collection per se. Users may convert addresses on Ethereum into formats that are simple to read with this method. In essence, an ENS domain registration grants you a distinct NFT that is linked to the domain name of your choice, which you can then transfer or sell as with any other NFT.\n\nDiverse Range of Top Sellers\n\nFollowing closely behind ENS, the $PIZZA BRC-20 NFTs, hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain, secured the second position with $2.18 million in sales. Even though it topped the charts on Sunday with $7.12 million, sales of this collection fell. With $1.24 million in sales, Guild of Guardians Avatars on the Immutable network took third place.\n\nWith sales of $987,910, the Blast\u2019s Fantasy Top collection came in fourth place, and with $635,539 in sales, the Genesis Fanta Field collection on Solana made its debut in the top 10. With $583,411 in sales, the DMarket collection, a component of the Mythos network also left its impact, coming in sixth.\n\nWith $470,907 in sales, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a flagship NFT from Yuga Labs and the second-highest seller ever, finished the day in eighth place. The OKX NFT Creation series, based in Polygon, came in just behind, taking eighth place with $414,817 in sales. With sales of about $350,000 apiece, two more Polygon collections Matr1x Fire Weapon and TTAvatars rounded out the top 10.\n\nBlockchain Breakdown\n\nRegarding the blockchain, Ethereum, under the leadership of ENS, commanded the most daily sales amounting to $8.45 million, a notable rise over $4.51 million the day before. The daily sales volume on the Bitcoin blockchain was $4.11 million, a decrease from the $11.03 million that was reported on June 9. Sales on the Solana blockchain were $2.68 million, however transactions on the Polygon blockchain totaled $2.44 million, which was a greater volume. Immutable recorded $1.56 million in sales, while the Blast blockchain recorded $988,646 in sales.\n\nIn summary, ENS\u2019s surge in NFT sales, alongside a diverse range of collections and blockchain activity, underscores the growing prominence and dynamism of the NFT market."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent data from CryptoQuant indicates a bearish outlook for Ethereum (ETH), suggesting that the current downward trend might continue if prevailing conditions persist. Ethereum, struggling to maintain momentum above the $4,000 mark, is facing significant pressure from futures market participants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n$ETH's plummet might persist in the short term\n\n\n\n\u201cThis trend suggests that the majority of futures traders have been selling #Ethereum aggressively, either for speculative purposes or to realize profits.\u201d \u2013 By @Greatest_Trader\n\n\n\nLink \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/yz9DVphQ8l \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2024\n\nThe provided chart illustrates the seven-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, an indicator used to gauge the aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers on the futures market. This metric is crucial for understanding market sentiment and potential future price movements. A value above one indicates buyer dominance, suggesting more aggressive buying activity. Meanwhile, a value below one signals seller dominance, pointing to more aggressive selling activity.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum, the chart reveals a troubling trend. The ratio has consistently failed to climb above one and has been on a sharp decline recently. This decline indicates that the majority of futures traders are selling ETH aggressively. This selling could be driven by speculative strategies or the need to realize profits amid market volatility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImplications of current trend\n\nThe significant drop in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio is a bearish signal. It suggests that sellers are outweighing buyers, leading to increased downward pressure on Ethereum's price. If this trend continues, ETH might struggle to break through resistance levels, potentially leading to further price declines.\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to this aggressive selling behavior. For instance, the overall bearish sentiment on the crypto market could be influencing ETH traders to sell off their positions in anticipation of further declines. Moreover, traders might be realizing profits from previous gains, contributing to increased selling pressure."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices wavered Wednesday as investors parsed commentary from the Federal Reserve that provided new insight into the U.S. central bank\u2019s fight against inflation.\n\nPolicymakers\u2019 move to leave interest rates unchanged for an 11th consecutive month was a foregone conclusion, based on movements in Fed futures markets. At its most restrictive position in over 20 years, the Fed kept its benchmark borrowing rate at a range between 5.25% and 5.50%.\n\nThis month\u2019s release of a so-called \u201cdot plot,\u201d however, suggested shot callers at the U.S. central bank have seen a notable shift in financial conditions since March. The Fed in its most recent Summary of Economic Projections had penciled in three rate cuts through years-end.\n\nThe dot plot released Wednesday suggested Fed policymakers now think one rate cut could be more appropriate\u2014interpreted by the market as a hawkish sign. The projection went beyond the two rate cuts that economists had expected the Fed could telegraph, as it looks to keep rates higher for longer in the face of a strong economy and U.S. labor market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptocurrency prices had risen earlier in the day on news that inflation had slowed to 3.3% in the 12 months through May. The report indicated that consumer prices for American goods and services rose slightly less last month than economists had expected.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s announcement, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell. Just 15 minutes after the Fed\u2019s move, for example, Bitcoin\u2019s price swiftly fell 1.2% to around $69,000 from $69,900. Meanwhile, the prices of Ethereum and Solana also ticked down at similar rates.\n\nThe Fed has maintained in recent months that it will not cut rates until it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed that stance on Wednesday and said, \u201cSo far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,\u201d Powell added in a statement. \u201cIn recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s policy meeting, futures traders penciled in a 61% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, likely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing rates. That figure fell to 59% following the release of Powell\u2019s written remarks.\n\nNot long before U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed began lifting interest rates from near-zero to cool a red-hot economy. While inflation has come down significantly since then, Powell affirmed Wednesday that the U.S. central bank\u2019s quest to 2% isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nPowell pointed to Wednesday\u2019s Consumer Price Index report, where inflation was flat on a month-to-month basis in May, as a sign of potential progress. \u201cLet me say that we welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals,\u201d Powell added, of which one is \u201cmaximum employment\u201d among U.S. workers.\n\nThe price of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, typically face pressure as interest rates rise and the payouts on holding cash and U.S. Treasuries become more attractive. Investors anticipate the opposite would happen as the Fed loosens U.S. monetary conditions.\n\n\u201cWe can't know what the future holds, but in the meantime, we've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance,\u201d Powell said, adding that the Fed is looking for a gradual decline in inflation and greater balance in the labor market. \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress here.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add a further quote from Powell.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies popped Wednesday after a widely watched inflation gauge showed that U.S. consumer prices increased last month by less than economists had expected.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.3% in the 12 months through May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists\u2019 forecast of 3.4%. Previously, the index tracking American goods and services showed that consumer prices rose 3.4% annually.\n\nImmediately following the report\u2019s release, Bitcoin jumped 2.8% to around $69,500 from $67,900. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Solana, showed gains of over 3% over the past day, but their prices had still fallen over the past week after Friday\u2019s flash crash.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite opened in the green. The move came just hours before the Federal Reserve\u2019s June policy meeting, where the U.S. central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady for an 11th straight month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Fed\u2019s decision loomed, Bitcoin is nearing a price of $70,000 as of this writing, showing gains of over 4% over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, U.S. inflation was flat. The reading followed a 0.3% bump in consumer prices in April and a 0.4% increase in March and February.\n\nWhile investors had already anticipated that Fed policymakers would leave interest rates untouched Wednesday, rate cut hopes for September strengthened, however. That chance rose after the report\u2019s release to 62% from 46%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\n\nLikely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing costs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that policymakers need \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation is heading to its target of 2% annually before loosening monetary policy through rate cuts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShifting rate cut expectations dented Bitcoin\u2019s price in April, knocking the cryptocurrency away from all-time highs above $73,000 a month prior. However, analysts say Bitcoin could test those prices again as a path toward rate cuts emerges with more certainty and a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cAt this point, my confidence in Fed rate cuts is pretty high,\u201d Grayscale's Head of Research Zach Pandl said on Twitter (aka X), adding that rate cuts becoming a base case again is good for the strength of Bitcoin relative to the dollar in a separate post.\n\nLow Core CPI inflation in May => Fed rate cuts again the base case => bad for Dollar, good for Bitcoin $BTC pic.twitter.com/2Ntlfl3iJs \u2014 Zach Pandl (@LowBeta_) June 12, 2024\n\nMarkets largely shrugged at hotter-than-expected U.S. job growth last Friday. Still, hours after the figures were released, Bitcoin plunged alongside the rest of the crypto market, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of liquidations in leveraged crypto positions.\n\nOn Wednesday, the dollar value of liquidated positions was comparatively muted. Within the past four hours, $10 million worth of crypto long positions have been purged, while bearish traders saw $39 million worth of short positions be closed, per data from CoinGlass.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "Ethereum Futures Traders Selling Aggressively, Will ETH Price Drop Further? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Amid the broader cryptocurrency market correction, the Ethereum (ETH) price has faced significant selling pressure, with its price dropping 3.5% to $3,550. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume has surged by 84%, reaching $14.8 billion.\n\nEthereum Futures Traders Sell Aggressively\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price struggling to surpass the $4,000 mark, traders might want to focus on the behavior of futures market participants, as per the CryptoQuant report. The chart below displays the 7-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers. A value above one indicates buyer dominance, while a value below one indicates aggressive selling.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs shown in the chart, the ratio has failed to rise above one and has been declining sharply in recent days. This trend suggests that most futures traders have been selling Ethereum aggressively, either for speculative purposes or to realize profits. This significant drop in the metric is a bearish signal, indicating that the current downward retracement could continue if this trend persists.\n\nOn the other hand, Santiment\u2019s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) suggests that holders are selling at significant profits, while steep dips indicate holders realizing losses, potentially signaling panic sell-offs and investor capitulation.\n\nFor ETH, the NPL indicator spiked dramatically from 36.69 million on June 10 to 1.06 billion on June 11. This positive trend indicates that holders are selling at substantial profits, hinting at the formation of local tops.\n\nUncertainty Surrounding Spot Ether ETF Approval\n\nAnalysts believe that ETH is failing to catch the bullish momentum as there\u2019s no clarity on how long it would take for the SEC to approve the S-1 filings. Despite the Ethereum investment inflows hitting record last week, investors aren\u2019t sure whether this shall continue further.\n\nHowever, even if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves filings from BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, and other firms this week, investors worry that the current market conditions are not conducive to demand for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nFor the Ethereum price, there\u2019s a notable support zone, comprising the 100-day moving average at $3,430 and the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $3,419.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the Ethereum whale accumulation continues or not going ahead. Additionally, macroeconomic concerns are showing further signs of stress.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Investing.com - Twelve cryptocurrency wallets purchased 156,733 from Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) in the past few hours, valued at approximately $574 million. This transaction was completed at an average price of $3,664 per Ethereum.\n\nHowever, despite these purchases, Ethereum's price is struggling amid corrections that have hit the crypto market in general.\n\nIf you're looking for an opportunity to invest in crypto companies' stocks amid the recent market movements, Investing Pro provides you with the necessary tools to make informed investment decisions. Despite the challenges Ethereum faces after the massive purchase of 156,733 units worth nearly $574 million, there is still optimism for price increases due to the supply on exchanges dropping to a level not seen in seven years. Subscribe now and get an additional discount by using the code SAPRO2. Click here to subscribe.\n\nWill Ethereum's price drop by 7%?\n\nAccording to data from the analysis platform Spot On Chain, 11 out of the 12 cryptocurrency wallets withdrew about 13,059 Ethereum. Notably, one of the wallets \u2013 0xdfa, withdrew a slightly higher amount, 13,084 Ethereum.\n\nMeanwhile, the supply of Ethereum on cryptocurrency exchanges has significantly decreased, reaching its lowest level in seven years, as reported by blockchain data from Glassnode. Lark Davis, an experienced crypto investor, highlighted this trend.\n\n\"The supply of Ethereum on exchanges is at its lowest level in 7 years, and as a result, the price of Ethereum could rise significantly.\"\n\nAt the same time, the crypto community is abuzz with the recent approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Ethereum ETFs. This development is a crucial advancement for the cryptocurrency market, opening the door for significant potential investments, reflecting the early success seen with ETFs.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent crypto researcher Bobby Banzai predicts monthly inflows of $569 million into Ethereum ETFs. His predictions are based on the performance of international ETFs and futures data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nDespite these positive developments and market optimism, the immediate impact on Ethereum's price has been unfavorable. Following these large purchases, Ethereum's price has dropped by 4.91% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading around $3,494.18. Spot On Chain attributed this to the possibility that the transactions from new wallets could be part of over-the-counter (OTC) deals, which do not directly affect the market price. The data analysis platform's forecast indicates cautious short-term expectations for Ethereum, predicting a potential 7% correction from the current market price.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum faced challenges this Tuesday, with the digital currency market undergoing a price correction. If this downward trend continues, Ethereum's next support level could be at $3,302.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, has dropped by about 3%, has fallen around 7%, and has decreased by approximately 7%."

Meanwhile, issuers plan to market Ethereum as the 'ultimate app store\u2019.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Low exchange supply, high ETF inflows, \u2018ultimate app store\u2019\n\nEthereum has recorded several amazing feats in the past few days despite its recent price decline. Here are the latest ETH market movers:\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, only 10.5% of the total ETH supply was left on exchanges as of June 8. Coupled with the declining exchange supply, data from IntoTheBlock shows that large ETH holders (addresses with >10K ETH) recorded a net inflow of 267K ETH on Thursday, the highest daily accumulation since March. This shows that investors are becoming increasingly bullish on ETH, potentially because of the expectation of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum's price suffers slight decline amid Hong Kong's plan to allow staking in ETH ETFs\n\nRecent Bitwise research revealed that crypto protocols on Ethereum generated more revenue than Robinhood, Reddit, Yelp and Etsy in Q1 2024. \"These applications are a testament to the resilience, creativity, and vision of the global crypto industry,\" said Bitwise.\n\n\n\nGlobal Ethereum ETFs witnessed about $69 million in inflows \u2014 their highest inflow since March. Inflows across ETH ETFs will likely continue to rise as investors expect spot ETH ETFs to begin trading in the US in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nHigh inflows follow predictions from Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, Jag Kooner, that spot Ethereum ETFs could attract around 10-20% of flows witnessed in spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHe built his predictions around the historical flows seen in Gold ETFs after they launched in 2004 and how it paved the way for subsequent flows in Silver ETF launches in 2006. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has previously shared a similar analysis comparing ETFs of Bitcoin to those of Gold and Ethereum to Silver.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum ecosystem active users spike 55% in Q1, 2x ETH ETF records impressive volume\n\nMeanwhile, executives of different issuers, including Van Eck, 21Shares and Franklin Templeton, deliberated on the potential demand for Ethereum ETFs in a recent panel session moderated by Eric Balchunas. According to Balchunas, the executives plan to \"position it (Ethereum) as being like a 'producing tech stock', 'ultimate app store', very different pitch than BTC.\"\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum to see a potential bullish reversal\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,661 on Monday after the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data on Friday cooled signs of any potential breakout above the $3,900 resistance. The NFP news briefly sent ETH below the $3,618 support before a slight recovery. ETH liquidations sit at $9.47 million, with the majority coming from long liquidations worth $6.99 million.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAccording to data from Laevitas.ch, the ETH futures premium dropped from around the 15% mark to 13% on Monday \u2014 its lowest level since the SEC's position response toward spot ETH ETFs \u2014 signaling dwindling investor interest. The futures premium stays around 5% to 10% in neutral market conditions.\n\nRead more: Ethereum open interest surges by 50%, SEC Chair says ETH ETF launch will take more time\n\nETH Open Interest (OI) also declined from $16.97 billion on June 6 to $16.37 billion on Monday, a $600 million decrease. However, considering prices declined faster than OI, investors may still be confident of a bullish reversal, indicating the bearish move could be temporary.\n\nAs a result, ETH will likely sustain a horizontal move slightly tilted toward an upward movement. The $3,900 resistance is the key price level for ETH to overcome before any significant breakout. A sustained move below the $3,618 support will invalidate the bullish thesis."

        "content": "U.Today - Although was beginning to gain traction on the market, the severe and ongoing consolidation that produced virtually nothing and only pulled ETH at about $3,800 was an important signal pointing to the asset's potential future performance.\n\nDespite its early strong momentum, the price action of ETH has surprised a lot of traders. After hitting resistance at about $3,800, Ethereum entered a consolidation phase. The current decline that we have observed, which is frequently an indication of market indecision, was foreseen in this instance by sideways movement. Over the past few days, Ethereum's price has dropped significantly, approaching $3,500.\n\nThe market had been feeling bullish overall, so many people were surprised by this sudden decline. There are several possible reasons for this unforeseen behavior. Initial liquidity issues could be crucial. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment are always important. Ethereum's performance may have been impacted by recent global financial trends, regulatory news or even bigger sell-offs on the market. It is also critical to keep in mind that fluctuations in (such as the decline below $70,000) frequently have an impact on the entire cryptocurrency market, including Ethereum.\n\nTechnical indicators show that there was a significant sell-off of ETH in a short period of time. Reentry by buyers onto the market may indicate potential for expansion. Moving averages also show another concerning pattern: the shorter-term MAs crossing below the longer-term MAs, which is typically a bearish signal. Despite the recent downturn, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong.\n\nBitcoin is struggling\n\nBitcoin is struggling to cross the $70,000 threshold for a number of reasons. The significant lack of purchasing power is one of the main causes. Bitcoin's price previously reached all-time highs due to significant capital inflows.\n\nA decreasing number of new purchasers are nevertheless willing to make these high-level investments, according to the state of the market. The lack of buying interest is making it difficult for Bitcoin to surpass the psychological $70,000 barrier.\n\nThe change in institutional behavior is another important component. Institutions are now shifting money away from Bitcoin ETFs despite the fact that they were crucial to Bitcoin's earlier rallies. This change is partially the result of people looking for better returns in alternative asset classes or new developments in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe potential price of Bitcoin is weakened by diminished institutional support because a significant portion of the buying pressure that raised prices came from these large-scale investors.\n\nFurthermore, strong fundamental drivers that have historically sparked enormous bull runs are absent from Bitcoin at the moment. While the NFT craze played a similar role in 2021, the ICO boom in 2017 propelled Bitcoin to previously-unheard-of heights. There is currently no trend or invention like this propelling investor capital and enthusiasm toward Bitcoin on a large scale.\n\nThe struggles of Bitcoin are also reflected in technical indicators. It appears that neither overbought nor oversold conditions exist as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been circling around neutral. This neutral RSI adds to the general sense of indecisiveness and uncertainty on the market, further impeding any meaningful price movement.\n\nin trouble\n\nXRP's current state is really problematic. The asset has lost numerous key support levels like the 50 EMA, psychological levels at $0.5 and others. Such performance certainly puts XRP down on the list of better-performing assets. However, the only question now is: will it reach the yearly low of $0.44?\n\nXRP has been steadily losing value over the last few weeks as it has been in a downtrend. The first real red flag appeared when the 50-day EMA disappeared. After that, XRP dropped below both the critical psychological support level of $0.5, which is represented by the orange line on the 100-day EMA, further deteriorating its technical outlook.\n\nThe annual low of $0.44 is the next significant support level for XRP. The likelihood of reaching this level appears to be growing given the state of the market and technical indicators. There is a long-term bearish trend indicated by the 200-day EMA, which is still significantly above the current price.\n\nThe absence of significant purchasing power is one of the primary causes of XRP's downfall. The asset finds it difficult to hold onto its value, much less increase it in the absence of substantial buy-side interest. Due to investor caution brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties, the overall market conditions for cryptocurrencies are currently not very favorable.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

        "content": "Among the news from yesterday, the SEC added ProShares\u2019 request to those that should be definitively approved for the issuance of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIn May, it had approved eight more, but evidently, the one from ProShares had not yet arrived.\n\nThe fact is that, despite having already approved the requests, the process to reach the final approval of all the documentation is not yet complete, and it is assumed that it will not be before July, or at most the end of June, so in fact there is still time to submit new applications.\n\nSEC news: The approval of ProShares\u2019 Ethereum ETF\n\nThe document published yesterday by the SEC reveals that NYSE Arca has proposed a rule change to list and trade shares of the ProShares Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe fund will be simply called ProShares Ethereum ETF, and for now it does not yet have a ticker.\n\nNow the SEC will allow time to submit public comments on this request until the end of the month, and then it will have 45 days to approve, disapprove, or extend the request.\n\nIt is however very likely that the final decision will come along with all the others, just as it happened both in May and January, when in a single day the SEC approved all the requests for the issuance of a spot Bitcoin ETF on the US exchanges.\n\nSo now there are nine requests that should be approved in July, and since for this ProShares request there is time until the end of June to submit comments, it seems likely that the block approval cannot happen before July.\n\nThe approval process\n\nSpecifically, what the SEC approved en bloc in May are the requests to be able to issue an Ethereum spot ETF on the US exchanges submitted by eight companies with the 19b-4 form.\n\nThis is actually just the first step, because to reach the final approval it is necessary for the SEC to also approve the S-1 form.\n\nCurrently, not all eight applicant companies have already submitted this final S-1 form, although at least one (BlackRock) has already done so.\n\nCertainly, it has not yet been presented by the ninth applicant, namely ProShares.\n\nThe approval of the S-1 form constitutes the definitive green light, after which the shares of the ETFs can effectively land on the stock exchange.\n\nIn January, when the S-1 forms of the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, the actual landing on the stock exchange took place the day after, because everything was already ready.\n\nThe same thing could happen for those on Ethereum, given that for several weeks now the issuing companies have been preparing for the actual launch.\n\nMoreover, although the SEC will most likely approve the S-1 forms all together, it is not certain that the ETFs will be listed on the same day, so there is a bit of competition among the different issuers to be among the first to have the opportunity to launch the actual trades on the stock exchange.\n\nThe successo\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January on the US exchanges have had great success from the very beginning.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that in the first weeks the Grayscale ETF took advantage of this to liquidate many BTC, given that previously it was a fund traded only OTC that could not easily liquidate the underlying and that over the years had accumulated as many as 620,000 BTC.\n\nIt is hypothesized that something similar could happen this time as well, given that one of the ETFs is precisely the Grayscale Ethereum Trust which holds more than 10.7 billion dollars of ETH.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has gone from 28.5 billion dollars to 19.2, and since it is hypothesized that Ethereum ETFs could attract capital equal to about a quarter or a fifth compared to those of Bitcoin, the risk that the current 10.7 billion is too much exists.\n\nTherefore, after the actual stock market debut, it will be necessary to distinguish between daily trading volumes, which could be significant, overall capital inflows or outflows on all new ETFs, and Grayscale liquidations.\n\nIn light of this, although in the case of high trading volumes this launch can immediately be defined as a success, it will be necessary to wait for the situation to stabilize before being able to issue a definitive judgment.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, it was evident from the beginning that the new ETFs were a success, but it took a few weeks before this success could start to have positive effects on the price of BTC.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that the price of ETH is not growing in these days of anticipation, probably also because in reality a drop in its price is expected after the actual landing on the stock exchange of its new ETFs."

        "content": "Neither Gary Gensler nor Elizabeth Warren is a fan of crypto. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn a warm evening in late September 2023, Mike Novogratz, the billionaire hedge funder turned crypto investor, walked into a restaurant in Washington, D.C. In town from New York, the CEO of Galaxy Digital had spent the day on Capitol Hill visiting with Congress as part of a contingent of crypto entrepreneurs \u2014 most of them young people of color \u2014 organized by industry giant Coinbase to send a message to Democrats at a moment when crypto was increasingly seen as a Republican cause. Some key lawmakers hadn\u2019t even shown up to the meetings. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat, and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating that they don\u2019t see crypto as progressive,\u201d Novogratz, an outspoken progressive who has donated millions of dollars to the party, including to Joe Biden in 2020, told me.\n\nOne Democrat was causing more frustration than any other: Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He had spent the bulk of his tenure in the Biden administration attacking crypto, rejecting the need for new industry regulations, suing or threatening a wide swath of crypto companies, and blocking new products like crypto ETFs. And much of the party seemed to be taking their cues from him.\n\n\u201cGensler is becoming a real problem for our industry,\u201d lamented Novogratz of his former Goldman Sachs colleague. \u201cPart of me wants to take him by the neck and crack it. And I probably would, but I don\u2019t want to get blood on my nice suit.\u201d He gestured to his cream-colored attire.\n\nNow, nine months later, many elected Democrats have done a legislative version of what Novogratz had in mind and offered a meaningful (if partial and hardly unanimous) rebuke of Gensler and the faction of the party \u2014 led by Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 that has been fiercely anti-crypto. In May, the Senate voted 60-38, including 11 Democrats and independent Kyrsten Sinema, to roll back an SEC accounting rule for digital assets, defying a veto threat by President Biden. (The bill would have allowed financial institutions to hold crypto on behalf of customers without having to account for it on their balance sheets, treating it the same way as traditional assets.) Chuck Schumer voted for it, an unusual move by the Democrat and Senate majority leader in that he effectively bucked the will of his party\u2019s leader. So did Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Ron Wyden. Then, a week later, 71 Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, helped pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, in the House, against the opposition of Gensler\u2019s SEC and the White House \u2014 a historic event in that it was the first successful vote for a bill that sets out to regulate cryptocurrency at all. Both measures were actively supported by crypto-industry lobbying groups. Late in the evening on the last Friday in May, Biden followed through on vetoing the Senate measure, but the parallel actions by both houses of Congress on two separate pieces of legislation unmistakably signified the moment when the Democrats ceased to be a straightforwardly anti-crypto party.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the public policy, Gary Gensler is just wrong about this,\u201d Congressman Wiley Nickel, a North Carolina Democrat who co-sponsored the House bill, told me. He hoped the vote (regardless of the bill\u2019s fate in the Senate) would signal that many Democrats do not share the beliefs of Gensler and Warren. \u201cIf Biden allowed Gary Gensler to be the only voice on this, he definitely would lose a significant number of votes,\u201d Nickel added. \u201cIf the Democratic Party were the party opposed to web3, to blockchain and crypto, we would only lose votes.\u201d\n\nThen on May 23, another surprise twist complicated the picture even more. After initially signaling that it would block a slate of new financial products (called ETFs, or exchange-traded funds) that would allow average investors a much easier route to purchase ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, the SEC suddenly \u2014 and, to many observers, shockingly \u2014 flipped and approved eight of them, including one from Novogratz\u2019s company. \u201cThe sense is that the tone from the SEC has just changed literally overnight,\u201d Emilie Choi, the president and COO of Coinbase, said at a conference just before the approval. \u201cProbably the administration sensing some panic, I guess.\u201d\n\nThere were signs that in the weeks leading up to these developments, Democrats had indeed begun to panic about the political implications of being pegged as hostile to crypto. Probably not coincidentally, this occurred after Donald Trump announced that his campaign would accept donations in crypto and that he would \u201cbuild a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!\u201d At a campaign event for holders of Trump\u2019s NFTs at Mar-a-Lago in May, the former president called up Ryan Selkis, an influential crypto entrepreneur who had previously voted for Biden, to speak at the podium, and Selkis threw his weight behind Trump.\n\nWell\u2026\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to share that I was in Mar-a-Lago tonight, but President Trump spoke very highly about crypto and then\u2026invited me and @MihailoBjelic on stage to say a few words.\n\n\n\nFight for crypto.\n\n\n\nSupport President Trump. pic.twitter.com/bPAnvFlxMp \u2014 Ryan Selkis (d/acc) \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@twobitidiot) May 9, 2024\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, the Democrats in crypto, the tenor of their conversation on the Hill and their friends in the White House, changed. It went from \u2018Guys, you really should pay attention to this\u2019 to \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re going to lose,\u2019\u201d says a person close to the industry. \u201cYou\u2019ve listened to Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren for so long, and now we\u2019re backed into a corner.\u201d Warren, of course, has been a chief enemy of crypto for years, making her belief that the industry is primarily a scam a core part of her platform. In a campaign ad last year, she included the Politico headline \u201cElizabeth Warren Is Building an Anti-Crypto Army.\u201d\n\nPressure had been building on Democrats to extend an olive branch to crypto supporters for months. A Coinbase-backed pro-crypto super-PAC called FairShake, which has raised nearly $100 million this election cycle, helped defeat Katie Porter in the California Senate primary in March, running attack ads against her for being an ally of Warren\u2019s. Recent polls showed that 20 percent of registered voters have owned crypto, amounting to some 35 million Americans, disproportionately made up of young Black men \u2014 an important cohort to Democrats. \u201cThat\u2019s a very sizable group, and a lot of them are single-issue voters,\u201d says Nickel. \u201cAnd they were being organized, and real money, material money, was going into it,\u201d says a veteran Democratic strategist.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those issues that there\u2019s no one really against it. You\u2019re not going to pick up any new votes for being against crypto,\u201d says the strategist. \u201cThere\u2019s only upside politically and policywise to be for it, and only downside politically and policywise to be against it.\u201d\n\nThe crypto landscape has also changed recently. While many in Washington had believed \u2014 or hoped \u2014 crypto would simply die and disappear after the collapse of FTX and the incarceration of Sam Bankman-Fried, the opposite proved true: Bitcoin recently traded at all-time highs thanks in part to new bitcoin ETFs, approved by Gensler\u2019s SEC in January, that made the cryptocurrency more accessible to regular Americans. Yet the SEC and Congress had yet to lay out a regulatory path for the industry to operate legally, nor had they enacted much in the way of practical protections for consumers. Frustration was growing among Democrats that they had fumbled the issue in a way that might even cost them a meaningful number of votes in 2024. \u201cThe approach that both Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren have advocated, refusing to regulate the technology on the grounds that that will be the best way to kill the technology, no longer makes any sense \u2014 it\u2019s a failed policy,\u201d says a person who has worked in prior Democratic administrations. \u201cBased on our polling, there are millions of voters who are going to vote against Joe Biden on the basis of Gary Gensler\u2019s approach on this issue. With democracy on the line, that\u2019s just a phenomenally irresponsible approach to take.\u201d\n\nWhile Congressional Democrats were reluctant to admit that Trump\u2019s pivot from a not particularly crypto-friendly first term had played a role in how they got a higher-than-expected number of their peers to vote for legislation favored by the crypto industry, Washington lobbyists and crypto advocates said it seemed to break the dam. \u201cThe shift is due to a long-term engagement effort by industry with congressional Democrats. The landslide is due to one person: President Trump,\u201d Selkis told me. \u201cThe president broke Elizabeth Warren\u2019s evil spell over the Democrats in the Senate, House, and White House.\u201d\n\nWhether the White House will adopt a friendlier crypto stance before the election is still something of a mystery. There are signs that a shift is in progress, though. Notably, Biden did not threaten to veto the House legislation the way he did the Senate measure, saying instead that while he opposed it, he was \u201ceager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets.\u201d (Justin Slaughter, the policy director for Paradigm, a crypto VC firm that has been one of the most active industry players in Washington, called it \u201cthe most positive statement by this or any White House on crypto, ever.\u201d)\n\nThis is the most positive statement by this or any White House on crypto, ever.\n\n\n\nThe key phrase is \u201cThe Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets\u201d & also states importance of developing them in US. https://t.co/zrG6X8Hzjy \u2014 Justin Slaughter (@JBSDC) May 22, 2024\n\nBiden\u2019s late-Friday veto of the Senate bill followed a flurry of efforts by Democrats in Congress to talk him out of it, including coming up with alternative paths to give Biden an out without going back on his word. Nickel, for one, told me he hoped Gensler would just withdraw the rule altogether. There is significant skepticism within the party about whether Biden\u2019s action was the right move. With its anti-crypto tenor, the veto amounts to \u201cpolitical malpractice,\u201d says the Democratic strategist, using a term I heard from other Democrats about the White House\u2019s crypto approach. \u201cI do think the White House, sooner rather than later, is going to make the decision that they don\u2019t want Gary Gensler to potentially impact their ability to win the election. And he has, full stop \u2014 he has. Millions of crypto voters are going to vote up or down on this.\u201d\n\nBiden just lost the crypto vote.\n\n\n\nWhat a stupid, stupid mistake. pic.twitter.com/4pk6nTczTl \u2014 Avichal - Electric \u03df Capital (@avichal) May 31, 2024\n\nEven for pro-crypto Democratic voters, though, flipping pro-Trump on this single issue is a huge leap. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of soul-searching happening in the industry, and it is quite complicated for a lot of folks who grew up voting Democrat to think on some level, Why does this guy that I voted for, and this party that I voted for, want to put my industry out of business?\u201d says the person close to the crypto industry. \u201cI\u2019ve seen colleagues wrestle with this.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Records Largest Outflow From Coinbase Topping 300K ETH, Price Gains Loom? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by global market cap, has again emerged as the talk of the crypto town today, June 12. The token recorded the withdrawal of over 300K coins from Coinbase recently, marking one of the largest exchange outflows of the year. This colossal outflow from Coinbase has stirred a whirlpool of speculations surrounding ETH\u2019s future price trajectory, tilting the balance toward the bullish side. Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the token\u2019s on-chain statistics.\n\nOver 336K ETH Withdrawn From Coinbase\n\nAccording to a post shared by CryptoQuant on X, based on this year\u2019s data, it can be clearly seen that on June 11, the exchange outflow totaled 336,284 ETH. Of particular note, this is the fifth time this year that more than 150K ETH has been withdrawn from the exchange. This totals over $1 billion in value, adding a layer of intrigue to the withdrawals and Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics. The large transactions range between $400 million and $1.1 billion each.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlthough the exact cause of these withdrawals could vary, high chances prevail that whales or as-yet-unknown institutions have driven these withdrawals. Should this be true, ETH\u2019s long-term prospects shine with bullishness.\n\nCryptoQuant previously recorded similar activities orbiting ETH before the commencement of spot Bitcoin ETFs, deeming it to be due to traders\u2019 anticipation of an overall market rally. Similarly, the withdrawal valued over $1 billion comes in tandem with approval in spot ETH ETFs recently. Crypto market enthusiasts continue to extensively eye the token as ETH remains poised to face the implications of reduced supply on exchanges.\n\nAlso Read: Chainalysis Bags Dismissal In $80M Employment Contract Breach Lawsuit\n\nEthereum Price Jumps\n\nWhereas, after the data surfaced in the market, the ETH price gained 3.02% to trade at $3,641. The token\u2019s market cap jumped 3.33% to $437.54 billion.\n\nCoinglass data illustrated that ETH futures OI dipped 1.67% to $15.86 billion, followed by a derivatives volume dip of 1.80% to $25.58 billion. This data aligns with Ethereum\u2019s recent bearish turn, wherein the token plunged from the $3,800 level to even below $3,500.\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI hovered at around 46, hinting that the asset is in neutral territory. Should buying pressure further prevail in the market, as in the abovementioned case, ETH could witness a additional bolstered price movement ahead. Nonetheless, selling pressure encountered by the token poses a risk to price.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF To See Majority Inflows Linked To Arbitrage, Here\u2019s Why\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMetaMask, a leading Ethereum wallet and browser extension, has launched its pooled staking service, allowing users to stake any amount of ETH.\n\nEthereum staking is the mechanism by which validators on the proof of stake network participate in consensus, or the verification of transactions before they're added to the blockchain. If their nodes process blocks of transactions that are online and process blocks when assigned, they collect rewards. And if they don't, they can see their staked ETH slashed as a penalty.\n\nBut users need 32 ETH to become a validator\u2014a criteria that 99% of holders fall short of, MetaMask said in its press release.\n\nThe pooled staking will allow MetaMask users to stake any amount of ETH and earn rewards for contributing to the network's security. The service is currently available to a small group of users, with a broader rollout expected soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, it will not initially be available in the United States or United Kingdom.\n\nThe crackdown on staking services in the U.S. has been severe. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Kraken $30 million in a settlement over charges that its crypto staking service constituted an unregistered offering of securities. Coinbase saw its staking service curtailed after the SEC made similar allegations against the San Francisco-based crypto exchange.\n\nIn the U.K., things are a bit less dire\u2014but still unclear.\n\nEconomic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami promised in Feburary this year that staking and stablecoin rules would be read in six months. When asked about progress during a Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit, he said he's still confident the rules will be implemented.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"What I\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins,\" Afolami said during the London event. \"Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSome members of the Ethereum community have seen the regulatory pressure or lack of clarity as an opportunity to further decentralize the network. As it stands, the U.S. accounts for 50% of all validator nodes on the network, followed by Germany with 12%, South Korea with 6%, and the UK with 4%, according to Etherscan.\n\nMatthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at Consensys\u2014the company behind Metamask\u2014emphasized the simplicity and control offered by the new service. \u201cMetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-grade validators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards, and making Ethereum more secure,\u201d he said.\n\nMetaMask's pooled staking is backed by Consensys Staking, which manages over 33,000 Ethereum validators and more than 1 million ETH staked. The company boasted in its press release that its has zero slashed validators and a 99.9% validator participation rate.\n\nMetaMask's move into pooled staking pits it against established players like Lido and Coinbase, which does still offer its staking service internationally and in several U.S. states. Together the two providers account for almost 45% of the 33 million ETH\u2014worth $116 billion at the time of writing\u2014that's been staked on the network.\n\nLido, the largest liquid staking platform, allows users to stake ETH and receive Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH) tokens, which can be used in DeFi applications while earning an annual percentage yield (APY) around 3.8%. The project's extensive liquidity and integration with numerous dApps make it a formidable competitor.\n\nMeanwhile Coinbase, though it has had to cut back on its staking service availability, is still the second-largest pooled staking provider by a wide margin. Its 15% portion is three times the size of the next couple competitors Figment, Ether.fi, and Kiln.fi."

        "title": "\u201cBitcoin\u2019s Next Move Could Be $100,000, But This Is Still Altcoin Season\u201d: Analysts Predict Ethereum and BlockDAG Network Takeover - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, June 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysts are offering a variety of predictions for Bitcoin's future price movements, reflecting a range of optimism influenced by upcoming events and historical trends. However, the broader cryptocurrency market indicates a burgeoning altcoin season, where altcoins, particularly those involved in AI and decentralized finance (DeFi) like BlockDAG Network and Ethereum, might outshine Bitcoin in the short and longer term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin Trend to $100,000\n\n\n\nOne of the most influential factors in Bitcoin price predictions is the recent Bitcoin halving event, occurred in April 2024. This event, which occurs roughly every four years, cuts the reward for mining Bitcoin in half, effectively reducing the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been followed by significant price increases. For example, post-halving price surges have been observed in past cycles, leading some analysts to forecast that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs of $100,000 now two months after the 2024 event.\n\nDan Tapiero, a prominent crypto analyst, predicts that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by late 2024 or early 2025. Tapiero cites the halving event and the increasing adoption of blockchain technologies by both countries and companies as key factors driving this potential rise. Similarly, Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered Bank also believes Bitcoin could test the $100,000 mark next year, driven by banking sector turmoil, the halving event, and the end of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.\n\nBeyond these optimistic forecasts, other analysts provide a more nuanced view. For instance, projections for Bitcoin's 2024 price range from a low of around $27,341 to a high of $118,102, reflecting the cryptocurrency's inherent volatility. This wide range highlights the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin's market behavior, influenced by various macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and shifts in investor sentiment.\n\nLooking further ahead, some predictions are even more bullish. By 2030, Bitcoin's price is anticipated to reach between $149,316 and $265,318, suggesting a potential increase of over 850% from its current levels. These long-term projections are often based on the assumption that institutional interest and mainstream adoption will continue to grow like it has done since 2009, providing an even stronger foundation for Bitcoin's value appreciation.\n\nAltcoins: Ethereum and BlockDAG Network Lead\n\n\n\nAnalysts point out that while Bitcoin may reach new highs, it lacks the explosive potential of many altcoins in the current market environment. The altcoin market shows substantial upside potential, driven by innovations in AI and blockchain technology. For instance, AI-focused cryptos like Bittensor, Fetch.ai, and Openfabric AI are gaining traction due to their novel applications in decentralized machine learning and AI-driven tasks.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum continues to be a critical player, with expectations of significant growth due to its extensive use in DeFi and other blockchain applications. Analysts suggest that Ethereum, along with BlockDAG Network , which offer scalable and efficient blockchain solutions, could lead the next phase of blockchain adoption.\n\nEthereum is poised to lead the altcoin season in 2024, according to several analysts and market experts. This potential leadership is attributed to various factors, including technological upgrades, regulatory developments, and the overall momentum in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOne of the critical drivers for Ethereum's potential leadership is the upgrades to its network. The most notable of these is the EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) upgrade, which took place in March 2024 and aimed to significantly reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability. This improvement is benefiting Ethereum's layer 2 (L2) networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, making Ethereum more efficient and attractive for users and developers.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is another catalyst for Ethereum's rise. ETFs make it easier for institutional investors to invest in Ethereum without dealing with the complexities of direct cryptocurrency transactions. The recent approval of Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong has already generated optimism in the market. There is also speculation about potential ETF approvals in the United States, which could further drive institutional adoption.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Historical Patterns\n\nHistorically, altcoin seasons follow significant events in the cryptocurrency market, such as Bitcoin halvings. Analysts like Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and Josh Olszewicz highlight that Bitcoin's recent performance often precedes a shift in investment towards altcoins. They suggest that Ethereum's underperformance relative to Bitcoin recently indicates a potential for a significant catch-up, especially as technological and regulatory developments come to fruition.\n\nCrypto analyst Ash Crypto has pointed out that Ethereum's current price action resembles the bullish breakout observed in 2020. If Ethereum follows a similar trajectory, it could reach new all-time highs overcoming the $4,000 mark and can catalyze a broader altcoin rally, potentially leading to a substantial increase in altcoin valuations.\n\nAt the same time, BlockDAG Network represents a significant advancement in blockchain technology, aiming to address some of the inherent limitations of traditional blockchain systems. Utilizing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG combines enhanced transaction speeds and security with high decentralization, creating a robust framework for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto mining.\n\nBlockDAG has garnered significant attention and investment since its inception. It has raised substantial funds through its presale, highlighting strong investor confidence. For instance, the project has already raised over $50 million and is seeing daily inflows of $500,000 that has left analysts claiming it could lead the altcoin market together with Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs market dynamics evolve, it is essential to recognize the distinct opportunities presented by different projects within the cryptocurrency landscape. Bitcoin's potential rise to $100,000 reflects its status as a digital store of value, while the altcoin market, especially with projects like Ethereum and BlockDAG Network, promises higher returns driven by technological advancements and new use cases. This diversification highlights the importance of a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment, balancing between established assets like Bitcoin and emerging technologies within the altcoin space.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

After the SEC recently allowed a spot in Ethereum ETF, people anticipated quick action on S-1 registrations. However, until now, issuers have not received any response from the commission, headed by its chairman, Gary Gensler. Following the first draft submission deadline, the timing of this communication has generated a lot of anxiety in the sector.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs cited on social media platform X by Nate Geraci, sources close to the SEC have indicated that at least one of the applicants is expected to get the long-awaited comments by the end of this week. Based on this information, Stakeholders have expressed hope and doubt, given that the SEC has not been known to act quickly regarding cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the recent retraction by Ark Invest, which had initially expressed interest in launching an Ethereum ETF in partnership with 21Shares, points to the risks and ambiguity that define this endeavor.\n\nSEC\u2019s Mixed Signals Stir ETH ETF Market Anxiety\n\nAdding to the confusion, the SEC has not been clear on its stand on the matter, which was not helped by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s recent comments on CNBC. Although the 19b-4 applications for a spot in Ethereum ETF got the green light, the absence of communication after the deadline has created suspense and concerns among potential issuers. This case shows how the SEC has to walk a thin line between promoting innovation and protecting investors in the risky crypto space.\n\nDespite these challenges, the interest in Ethereum as a viable investment vehicle remains strong. In its official statement, Ark Invest did not change its view on Ethereum\u2019s potential and long-term value, even if it had to give up on its ETF dreams. This sentiment is prevalent across the industry, as the conviction in Ethereum\u2019s establishment in the digital asset ecosystem remains strong.\n\nAs the week progresses, financial analysts watch the SEC\u2019s next moves. Major financial entities like JPMorgan have expressed caution, suggesting that the inflow into spot Ethereum ETF might be less than some expect. However, an approving nod from the SEC could significantly alter this outlook, potentially unlocking a new wave of institutional and retail investment into Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Spotlights Ethereum Layer 2 Progress, Hints Next Milestone\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary trader Peter Brandt has recently updated his outlook on the Ethereum (ETH) price chart, highlighting a worrying pattern. Thus, Brandt has identified a controversial head-and-shoulders top formation, which is typically seen as a bearish indicator, suggesting that the price may soon fall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis pattern usually signals a reversal from a bullish trend to a bearish one, often resulting in a significant drop in price.\n\nDespite identifying this bearish pattern, Brandt stressed that he is not short on cryptocurrencies. This is particularly interesting given that just a month ago, in early May, Brandt announced that he was officially short on Ethereum futures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, at that time, he made it clear that he refrains from shorting the spot market due to counterparty risk and always uses stop-loss orders to manage his risk.\n\nThis is# an arguable head and shoulders top. I do NOT short cryptos pic.twitter.com/gjC0OPoJm3 \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 11, 2024\n\nBrandt's current stance seems to be a shift from his previous position. While he is now signaling a potential bearish trend, the price of ETH has continued to rise. Currently trading at $3,500, the altcoin has seen a significant increase from its price a month ago, when it was trading at less than $2,900.\n\nThe head and shoulders top pattern highlighted by Brandt could be a critical warning for traders and investors. If the pattern holds true, the price of Ethereum could face a downturn in the near future. However, the market's recent behavior suggests a complex scenario, where traditional chart patterns and market sentiment are not entirely in tune."

        "content": "Biaoqing\n\nBeijing, China, June 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- It\u2019s no longer rumour that Biaoqing coin is going to be listed on popular Exchange Bitmart: and other leading exchanges would be coming onboard soon.\n\nBiaoqing Launched on June 9th on the Ethereum blockchain, $BIAO has experienced remarkable price growth. In less than a day, its market cap soared from a few thousand dollars to more $6 million, capturing the attention of the crypto space.\n\nThe team has big plans for the Biaoqing project. They are already listed on CoinMarketCap, the biggest crypto data aggregator, and are marketing in every way possible: billboards in the busiest places around the world, trending on various platforms (X, Telegram, dextools, etc.), partnerships with crypto influencers and crypto hedge funds, and many other initiatives. They are also hosting regular Twitter Spaces to keep the community updated and plan to continue their efforts to market $BIAO internationally.\n\n$BIAO is a memecoin based on the biggest meme that ever existed in China and the eastern world in general: Biaoqing. Biaoqing features a series of facial expressions printed on the head of a panda. It is a real phenomenon in Asia, to the point that it's impossible not to have seen it in any of their group chats. The Biaoqing faces are used as frequently as Westerners use their emojis. Like many other famous memes before them, $BIAO aims to rally memecoin enthusiasts around a meme that has never been truly presented in the crypto sphere.\n\nBecause of its narrative of being the \"Pepe of China,\" $BIAO immediately showed a lot of potential. The numerous Biaoqing memes surrounding the project, as well as their qualitative branding, contributed to its viral potential. The Biaoqing faces are hilarious and have tremendous potential to capture the hearts of every meme lover.\n\nIt is important to note that, like every other successful memecoin before it, $BIAO has a lot of originality. Western memes are saturating the market, and we've seen almost all of them represented by a token. But Eastern memes are still absent from the memecoin space, leaving a big gap to be filled. With Biaoqing being the number one meme in China, this could start a new trend. All of this suggests that $BIAO will most likely have a bright future.\n\n$BIAO is available on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network, without transaction taxes. It will also be listed on centralized exchanges, which, considering their tremendous trading volume, should happen very soon.\n\nWith a strong team, hilarious memes, extensive connections, the true originality of being the biggest meme in Asia, and aggressive marketing, Biaoqing shows promise. However, potential investors should conduct their own research before investing. Trade safely!\n\nStory continues\n\nSocials:\n\nWebsite: https://biaoqing.live/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/biaoerc20\n\nX(Twitter): https://x.com/biaoerc20\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has started reviewing an application from investment firm ProShares to create an Ethereum ETF.\n\nAccording to a report, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca had filed a proposed rule change that would allow it to list and trade the ProShares Ether ETF. However, the SEC publishing the filing doesn\u2019t mean approval yet, but it kicks off the formal review process.\n\nHowever, the SEC said there will be a 21-day period for the public to share comments on the proposed ETF. After that, SEC officials will have 45 days to approve, reject, or extend their review of the application thereafter.\n\nSEC just added the ProShares' Ethereum ETF Filing to its website. (That is extremely quick) Instinct initially says this wont launch on day 1 with the other ETFs whenever that is but who knows. This is interesting. https://t.co/VU0bYo3Gjr pic.twitter.com/npZYnljBmY \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 10, 2024\n\nIf approved, ProShares Ether ETF would directly track the price of Ethereum itself. Investors could buy shares to get exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price without actually buying and holding the crypto directly, which can be complicated.\n\nMoreover, ProShares plans to have Coinbase Custody Trust Company hold the actual Ethereum backing the ETF shares.\n\n\u201cThis is interesting,\u201d commented Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart regarding the filing. However, he cautioned that the ProShares ETF may not launch simultaneously with several other Ethereum spot ETFs that were approved by the SEC in May but still await final registration clearance.\n\nETFs from issuers like BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Valkyrie could begin trading as early as July according to some experts. Regardless of exactly when the first Ethereum ETF hits the market, its arrival would mark a major milestone for the crypto industry.\n\nIn addition to its proposed spot ETF, ProShares has already launched leveraged and inverse Ether futures ETFs this month that allow traders to speculate on the price of Ethereum. The asset manager was also one of the first to offer a Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021."

        "content": "ICBC, the largest bank in the world, claims that the crypto Ethereum represents the driving technical force of the digital future, defining it as \u201cdigital oil\u201d. At the same time, it describes Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nAccording to the bank ICBC, the crypto Ethereum is \u2018the digital oil of the 21st century\u2019\n\nAs anticipated, the largest bank in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is defining Bitcoin (BTC) as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and Ethereum (ETH) as \u201cdigital oil\u201d.\n\nIn a new report shared by Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets at VanEck, the ICBC praises the two main criptovalute by market capitalization.\n\nThe report indicates that the market demand for digital assets is robust, driving innovation in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe market demand drives the continuous evolution of digital currencies.\u201d\n\nThe report compares Bitcoin to gold, highlighting that the cryptocurrency has additional advantages:\n\n\u201cBitcoin maintains scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus, while simultaneously solving issues related to its divisibility, authenticity, and transportability. Its monetary attributes are weakening, while its asset attributes are strengthening.\u201d\n\nDefining Ethereum as \u201cdigital oil,\u201d the report praises the various features of the ecosystem of the leading smart contract platform. Although ICBC highlights some shortcomings of the network, it believes that technological progress will resolve them over time.\n\n\u201cEthereum has consistently improved its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing a technical foundation for the digital future.\u201d\n\nSustainability, security, and efficiency\n\nFurthermore, the report reiterates how Ethereum introduces Turing completeness with its unique programming language (Solidity) and the virtual machine (EVM).\n\nAllowing developers to create a wide range of smart contracts and complex applications, providing strong support to blockchain technology.\n\nNot surprisingly, says the report, its flexibility is widely recognized in the sectors of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and it is also expanding to physical infrastructure networks (DePin).\n\n\u201cIn essence, the Turing completeness of Ethereum allows it to execute any programming instruction with the necessary resources and correct instructions, but it also poses several practical challenges. Looking to the future, Ethereum developers will continue to work to balance sustainability, security, and efficiency.\u201d\n\nEthereum under pressure: bear forecasts dominate the market\n\nEthereum, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is going through a difficult period.\n\nIts price has indeed failed to surpass the threshold of 4,000 dollars, generating concern among traders and investors.\n\nTo better understand the current market dynamics, it is useful to observe the behavior of the participants in the futures market, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAn important indicator is the Taker Buy Sell ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers compared to sellers.\n\nA ratio greater than one indicates that buyers are more aggressive, while a ratio less than one shows greater aggressiveness on the part of sellers.\n\nExamining the 7-day moving average chart of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum, it is noted that the ratio, which has never exceeded one, has collapsed in recent days.\n\nThis indicates that the sellers have been more active in the futures market, continuing to sell short or to cash in the profits from the gains at the beginning of the year.\n\nA drop so marked in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio is not generally a positive sign for Ethereum. In fact, it indicates that the majority of futures traders are bear on Ethereum and expect a further price drop of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the macroeconomic context, several factors could reverse this trend. Good news, such as new partnerships, technological discoveries, or regulatory approvals, could restore investor confidence and drive up the price of Ether."

In addition, the introduction and development of stablecoins provide a bridge for the digital currency market to connect to the real world,\u201d ICBC highlighted.\n\nThe bank acknowledged the fact that Ethereum has its programming language known as Solidity but more importantly, ICBC highlighted how the network supports developers. Per the bank\u2019s published statement, ETH allows developers to deploy complex smart contracts as well as Decentralized Applications (DApps). ICBC believes strongly that this has made Ethereum the mainstay in inventive new fields like Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nFurthermore, the top China-based bank sees this sentiment transcending gradually to the physical infrastructure network.\n\nCommunity Awaits Final Approval For spot Ethereum ETF\n\nICBC\u2019s endorsement for the altcoin comes while the crypto industry is waiting for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to finally approve spot Ethereum ETF trading. The regulator has requested the submission of amended and updated S-1 registration from all Ethereum ETF applicants.\n\nLast week, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman hinted at the possibility of a slow process for the final spot Ethereum ETF trading approval. In his words, the approval of the necessary S-1 forms \u201cwill take some time.\u201d\n\nIt is worthy of note that after the submission of the S-1 applications, the Commission would provide filers with its first feedback which will in turn prompt more changes to be made.

        "content": "How are the crypto Pepe (PEPE), Kaspa (KAS), and Ethereum (ETH) performing? Below is an overview of current and future prices and the latest news featuring them.\n\nFluctuations in the price of Pepe: return to the all-time high or descent towards critical support?\n\nWhen the price of Bitcoin fell below the crucial support level of $68,000, the meme coin sector experienced a significant contraction, with the main cryptocurrencies in this segment seeing a substantial loss of value.\n\nAmong the most affected tokens, PEPE has continued to show a marked bear trend, recording a correction in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith the bearish sentiment dominating the market, a question arises spontaneously: will the price of Pepe manage to retest its all-time high (ATH) or will it slip towards the critical support level of $0.00000880?\n\nAfter a week of weak performance, Pepe managed to regain momentum, recording an impressive growth of 157.85% before encountering a pullback at the resistance level of $0.00001150.\n\nThe bulls managed to reclaim the support level of $0.00000880, which led to a doubling of the price over the next eight days, culminating in a new ATH of $0.00001718 on May 27.\n\nHowever, after reaching this new all-time high, Pepe experienced a sharp bear reversal.\n\nSince then, the price of the coin has been traded under strong selling pressure, indicating a negative influence for the meme coin in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIf the price manages to stay above the support level of $0.00001150, the bulls could regain momentum, potentially pushing the price of PEPE to test the resistance level of $0.00001410.\n\nFurthermore, if the bull manage to keep the price at that level, Pepe could be preparing to retest its previous ATH within the current month.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bear were to prevail, the price of Pepe could drop below the support level of $0.00001151 and head towards the critical support of $0.00000880 in the coming weeks.\n\nKaspa ready to reach the all-time high after overcoming the key resistance\n\nThe proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency Kaspa seems ready to reclaim its all-time high of $0.18, after surpassing the long-term resistance level located at $0.14.\n\nBetween April 12 and June 2, the price of KAS oscillated within a range, forming a horizontal channel. The upper part of the channel acts as resistance, while the lower part represents support. KAS found resistance at $0.14 and support at $0.1.\n\nSince the beginning of June, KAS has recorded a significant increase in trading volume. For example, on June 3, the daily trading volume of the altcoin reached 165 million dollars, the highest level since November 2023, according to data from Santiment.\n\nThis increase in trading activity pushed the price of KAS above the upper line of its horizontal channel on June 3, indicating a close above the resistance.\n\nThe analysis of price movements on a daily chart suggests that KAS could continue its bull trend.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) and the money flow index (MFI) of the altcoin were respectively at 79.91 and 70.44, confirming an increase in demand. These indicators show that the buying pressure on KAS has surpassed the selling pressure.\n\nThe price of the crypto Ethereum compared to PEPE and Kaspa\n\nThe recent data from CryptoQuant has highlighted a bear phase for Ethereum (ETH), with futures traders showing a strong selling bias.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is closely watching these developments, especially as Ethereum struggles to stay above $3,500, adding further pressure to an already unstable market.\n\nThe data from CryptoQuant provides an insight into the current market conditions of Ethereum, suggesting a possible continuation of the negative trend. The analysis focuses on the \u201cTaker Buy Sell Ratio,\u201d a key indicator of market sentiment in the futures sector.\n\nThis metric measures the balance between buying and selling activities: a ratio above 1 indicates a predominance of buyers, reflecting greater buying pressure, while a value below 1 highlights aggressive selling.\n\nUnfortunately for investors and Ethereum enthusiasts, this ratio has recently fallen below 1, indicating that sellers are outnumbering buyers.\n\nThis bearish trend is confirmed by the significant drop in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which has shown a clear shift towards the dominion of the sellers.\n\nAggressive sales could be driven by traders looking to capitalize on speculative gains or reduce risks in a context of high market volatility.\n\nThe persistence of this trend represents a worrying signal for the short-term prospects of Ethereum, which struggles to find stable support levels.\n\nThe cryptocurrency analyst Shayan BTC, who shared this update on the quick-take platform of CryptoQuant, observed:"

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Whether Bitcoin Hits Another All-Time High or Not - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum and Solana are set to soar higher in 2024, even if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways.\n\nAfter Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $73,750 in mid-March, crypto investors were understandably excited about where it could head next. The crypto seemed poised to skyrocket past the $100,000 level this year. But Bitcoin continues to trade right around the $70,000 mark, leaving some crypto investors searching for potential alternatives.\n\nIf you're one of those investors, there are two cryptocurrencies to put on your radar screen right now: Ethereum (ETH -0.14%) and Solana (SOL -0.11%). Both will potentially soar higher in 2024, whether or not Bitcoin goes along for the ride.\n\nEthereum\n\nThe big catalyst for Ethereum right now is the recent approval of eight new spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They're set to start trading soon, and when they do, it could lead to a huge influx of new investor money into Ethereum.\n\nWhile this influx of money isn't likely to be anywhere close to the amount of money that flooded into the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, it's nonetheless expected to be significant. For example, JPMorgan Chase predicts that the influx of new money into spot Ethereum ETFs could be as high as $3 billion over the next six months. And K33 Research, an independent crypto research firm, thinks the number could be as high as $4 billion.\n\nThe thought of so much new money flowing into Ethereum, which is already up 70% for the year, has some investors giddy. For example, some think Ethereum might outperform Bitcoin over the next six months, simply due to the potential impact of the ETF boom. When you add in the fact that Ethereum continues to roll out new tech upgrades to its core blockchain, there's growing cause for optimism.\n\nSolana\n\nLike Ethereum, Solana is up 70% for the year. This comes on the back of a monster year in 2023 when it skyrocketed more than 900%. While Solana's upward trajectory has cooled somewhat of late, there's still potential for an enormous move upward in the second half of the year.\n\nOnce you take a quick look at Solana's core metrics, you'll understand why. Just about every key metric has experienced tremendous growth over the past 12 months. The number of users is way up, transaction activity is way up, and the size of the Solana blockchain ecosystem continues to grow by leaps and bounds.\n\nIn no small part, this has to do with soaring consumer adoption. Solana has become the go-to blockchain for buying, selling, and launching meme coins. Even big-time celebrities (well, OK, B-list and C-list celebrities) are getting in on the action, with rappers, reality stars, and musicians launching meme coins of their own on Solana. Since these celebrities have millions of followers on social media, it's possible to argue that Solana is getting a free marketing blitz directed at its core user demographic (young, tech-savvy, and with plenty of disposable income to spend on crypto).\n\nThe good news is that all of this is uncorrelated with what's happening on the Bitcoin blockchain, so Solana can soar higher, even if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways.\n\nThe Layer 1 investment thesis\n\nEthereum and Solana share one key trait in common: They're both Layer 1 blockchains. This means that they're the fundamental building blocks of the blockchain world. When it comes to any key blockchain niche -- such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, or decentralized Web3 applications -- the core starting point is always the Layer 1.\n\nThat's what has me excited about Ethereum and Solana as potential Bitcoin alternatives. If you buy into the general notion that a crypto bull market rally should help to inject new life into every single niche of the blockchain and crypto world, then Ethereum and Solana should be among the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats, and Ethereum and Solana are two of the biggest boats out there. Even if you're on the sidelines about Bitcoin, it might be time to take a closer look at Ethereum or Solana."

        "content": "In a surprising development for the cryptocurrency, Litecoin (LTC) has surpassed both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in network activity. Indeed, the asset has surpassed the two leading cryptocurrencies, as LTC saw a 110% surge in daily active addresses over the last week, according to Santiment.\n\nThe development was the first time that Litecoin was able to surpass the two prominent digital assets. Moreover, its daily active address figures reached heights of 728,000, surpassing BTCs 593,000 and 419,000 by Ethereum. Subsequently, all eyes are on LTCs potential to orchestrate an epic rally from the metric.\n\nSource: Blockchain Reporter\n\nAlso Read: CFTC Calls Ethereum & Litecoin Commodities in KuCoin Lawsuit\n\nLTC Rally Incoming? Litecoin Could Build Off its Victory Over BTC and ETH\n\nThe digital asset market has been at the center of the finance sector, with the midpoint of 2024 fast approaching. Bitcoin had carried its early momentum to an all-time high in March, reaching $73,000. Moreover, Ethereum joined the leading cryptocurrency as the second asset to receive spot ETF approval this year.\n\nHowever, both of those cryptocurrencies were surpassed in one key metric by an unlikely competitor. Indeed, Litecoin (LTC) has recently beaten both Bitcoin and Ethereum in network activity. Specifically, the asset saw a massive surge in daily active addressees that exceeded both the leading assets.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nAlso Read: Litecoin Transactions Surpass 180 Million in 2023 as Adoption Accelerates\n\nMoreover, the market is now observing how LTC could respond to the metric increase. An influx of daily active addresses shows a growing consumer base, which should impact the price. However, the asset has seen its value decrease over the last several weeks.\n\nLitecoin is currently in the midst of a 4% decline over the last month, according to CoinMarketCap. Trading at $77.74 currently, there is hope that it could surge in the coming days. Over the past 24 hours, its volume has surged almost 60%, which is an interesting part of the growing equation."

        "content": "Wed 12 Jun 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nCryptocurrencies are going through a tumultuous period, marked by a significant drop in prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two main cryptos, are particularly affected. This decline raises questions about the future of the market and the forces at play. Let\u2019s analyze this situation in detail.\n\nSelling Pressure: A Threat to Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, often perceived as a safe haven in the crypto sphere, is not immune to market fluctuations. The crucial support level to watch on the daily chart is $66,205. This threshold coincides with a major resistance line.\n\nA close below this level could intensify selling pressure, leading to a further drop in price.\n\nConversely, the most important resistance level for Bitcoin is $69,667. Recently, this level has generated strong resistance pressure, preventing the price from rising.\n\nA daily close above this threshold could rekindle the hope of an uptrend. However, investors need to stay cautious, as market movements are often unpredictable.\n\nIf the flagship crypto closes below $66,205, selling pressure could accelerate. This situation could push the price to new lows, further eroding investor confidence.\n\nIncreased market volatility heightens risks, making predictions difficult. Traders should therefore closely monitor these critical levels.\n\nEthereum: Between Consolidation and Selling Pressure\n\nEthereum, the second largest crypto, is also under significant pressure. On the daily chart, a consolidation has emerged after breaking out of a triangle pattern.\n\nThis consolidation is often a sign of stability, but the current selling pressure has broken the key support level.\n\nFor the ETH crypto, the most important support level is $3,502. A daily close below this level could trigger an increase in selling pressure, nullifying recent optimistic gains linked to ETFs. This situation would be concerning for investors who hoped for a sustainable rebound.\n\nThe key resistance level for this crypto is the 9 EMA average of $3,689. A daily close above this level could give a boost to the price, paving the way for a recovery. However, the market remains fragile, and investors need to stay vigilant against unpredictable fluctuations.\n\nIn the coming days, Ethereum\u2019s behavior around support and resistance levels will determine its trajectory.\n\nInvestors need to be ready to react quickly to market moves to minimize losses and maximize potential gains. Patience and caution are essential in this uncertain period.\n\nMacroeconomic Factors: A Determining Influence\n\nThe price fluctuations of Bitcoin and the ETH crypto cannot be fully understood without examining macroeconomic factors. The global economic situation plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency movements.\n\nEconomic reports, such as employment data in the United States, have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFor example, a recent report revealed stronger-than-expected job growth in May, contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s decline. This data influences investors\u2019 decisions and trading strategies.\n\nDecisions by central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, also affect cryptocurrencies. For example, lower interest rates can make risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. However, uncertainties around future central bank decisions add a layer of complexity to market analysis.\n\nOverall investor sentiment also plays a role. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can lead to massive sell-offs, while excessive optimism can lead to impulsive buying.\n\nInvestors need to stay informed and vigilant, adopting a proactive approach to managing risks. Caution is essential in this uncertain landscape. The future of cryptos remains promising, but the road is fraught with challenges. Indeed, the risk of liquidation persists around 71k.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "content": "Wed 12 Jun 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nAfter a rise of more than 20%, Ethereum\u2019s price is undergoing a bearish correction. Let\u2019s examine the future outlook for ETH together.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Situation\n\nAfter rising from $3,000 to $3,800 following the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price stabilized before facing bearish pressure, bringing it down to $3,500. This decline was fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s slight drop, which pulled the entire cryptocurrency market with it. Currently, the cryptocurrency seems to be stabilizing, demonstrating renewed interest from buyers. At the time of writing this article, one Ether is worth slightly more than $3,500. Thus, it is below the $3,800 mark, which corresponds to the point of control noted since its last rebound.\n\n\n\nThe point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest trading volume over a given period, indicating a key support or resistance zone.\n\nThe next value area to consider is just below the Ethereum price level, specifically below the $3,000 mark. This area coincides with the identified support zone at the same price level.\n\nEthereum remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, continuing to confirm the idea that the cryptocurrency is in an uptrend. However, it should be noted that Ethereum\u2019s momentum is being revised downwards, as evidenced by the oscillators and Ethereum\u2019s own price.\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market. Today, he is a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of self-employed traders active since 2017. You\u2019ll find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around the financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere.\n\nA Closer Look at Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest of perpetual contracts linked to Ethereum has recently followed the course of its underlying asset. Coupled with a still-positive funding rate, this demonstrates majority participation from buyers in Ethereum derivatives. However, it should be noted that, although positive, these rates have been slightly revised downwards, reflecting a slight capitulation from buyers. This phenomenon could be explained by increasing selling pressure, but also by liquidations, particularly marked on the buyers\u2019 side.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USD\n\nThe liquidation heatmap of ETH/USDT over three months reveals that the liquidation zone at $3,700 was recently reached. It seems to have triggered buying interest that was not sustained, allowing the bearish movement to continue. Currently, the most significant liquidation zones are on both sides of the current price. Above, we can note the $3,900 zone. Below, we can note the $3,000 zone. The price approaching these levels could trigger a massive number of orders, thus increasing the risk of a period of heightened volatility for Ethereum. These zones therefore represent a crucial point of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price remains above $3,300, we could anticipate a bullish recovery up to $3,900 or even $4,000. The next resistance to consider would then be $4,100. If the upward movement continues, this could mark a new high at $4,500 and even reach Ethereum\u2019s ATH, just below $4,900. At this stage, it would represent a rise of more than 37%.\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price fails to stay above $3,300, we could envisage a return to around $3,000. The next support to consider, if the bearish movement continues, would be in a price range between $2,800 and $2,700. At this stage, it would represent a decrease of around -13%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter an initial rise followed by stabilization, Ethereum\u2019s price has faced bearish pressure, partly due to a decline in the overall cryptocurrency market. Currently, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilization with renewed interest from buyers. Although these fluctuations cast doubt on Ethereum\u2019s future direction, its underlying trend remains bullish, favoring the idea of a potential rebound. However, it will be crucial to closely monitor the price\u2019s reaction to the different key levels to confirm or invalidate current hypotheses. It is also important to stay vigilant against potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let\u2019s remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum price broke out downward from a consolidation zone, invalidating the previous bullish flag. Meanwhile, the markets eagerly await the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday to know whether interest rates will get cut or spike higher.\n\nThe price of Ethereum was $3,448 during American trading hours on Tuesday, a 6% drop in the last 24 hours and a further 9.7% decrease in 7 days, as per CoinGecko data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH/USD Price Prediction: Bears Take Hold of the Market, These Are the Support Levels to Watch\n\nETH price was previously trending in a consolidation zone, part of a larger bull flag market structure. Bull flags are bullish, and the markets expected the pattern to resolve upwards. However, the Ethereum price experienced great downward pressure in the early morning hours of June 11.\n\nThe price of Ethereum broke below the range, invalidating the bull flag on the 4-hour timeframe. Nevertheless, on the daily timeframe, ETH price action is still trending above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), albeit very close.\n\nIf bears persist, ETH price may drop further and find support at the 50-day SMA, which also coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. This will put the price of ETH around $3,400. Further below, key support areas exist around $3,200 and $2,900.\n\nOn the flip side, if the bulls overpower the bears, the ETH price may rally and test the lower boundary of the range around $3,650. If ETH continues to rise, it may re-enter the range and move sideways between $3,700 and $3,950 before breaking to the upside and heading towards $4,200. Currently, $3,650 is the strongest resistance level for Ethereum price action.\n\nWhy is the Ethereum Price Crashing?\n\nThe drop in Ethereum price comes a day ahead of the FOMC meeting and also coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price. The crypto community thinks that the recent market panic is connected to the FOMC outcome.\n\nThe panic is of FOMC and PPI outcome coming on wed and thurs. My guess is we will pump back strong after FOMC and PPI numbers\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f#Bitcoin #altcoins \u2014 \u20bf SatMaxx \u20bf (@vinee202) June 11, 2024\n\nMarket analysts from Bankrate forecast that the FOMC will leave interest rates at a 23-year high in the upcoming meeting. However, they also estimate that there will be three or fewer rate cuts before the end of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum fundamentals remain strong, as the mainnet continues to dominate in fees over Layer 2s, generating 20X more fees than the top L2s combined.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors remain alert for Wednesday and Thursday since FOMC and PPI data may influence the next direction of Ethereum price and the general markets. Ethereum\u2019s positive fundamentals may help sustain the price if FOMC results and comments turn out negative for the markets\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "title": "Ethereum Struggling With MEV Bots, Executive Argues That Solana Has Succeeded - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Unlike Bitcoin, where transactions are ordered on a first-come, first-served basis, Ethereum and Solana rely on a pool of validators to confirm transactions and add them to the next block. This process allows for flexibility, as users can expedite their transactions by paying higher fees.\n\nAt the protocol level, prioritizing transactions based on gas fees has inadvertently led to the rise of complex Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots on Solana and Ethereum. By exploiting the system, these bots have become a significant factor in the ongoing debate about gas fees.\n\nMEV Bots Pushing Gas Fees Higher On Ethereum?\n\nNow, the debate surrounding validators, gas fees, and the impact of MEV bots on Solana and Ethereum is escalating. Mert Mumtaz, the co-founder of Solana RPC provider Helius, taking to X, highlighted the role of a single sandwich bot, Jaredfromsubway, which was the top source of gas fees on Ethereum.\n\nThis bot alone is responsible for a staggering 142 ETH per day, surpassing fees paid by major players like Coinbase.\n\nWith this MEV bot being the highest source of gas fees on Ethereum, the co-founder argues that by not subsidizing validators, the Ethereum Foundation is indirectly endorsing MEV bot operators to continue \u201crobbing\u201d retail traders.\n\nAs it is, Ethereum, notorious for its scalability issues, is the most expensive network to transact on. Though on-chain scaling is a concern, the proliferation of MEV bots as seen with Jaredfromsubway, could be contributing immensely.\n\nIs Solana Doing A Better Job At Addressing MEV Bots?\n\nIn light of this, the analyst points out that Ethereum developers have failed to address the MEV menace despite years of dedicated research and solutions at various protocol levels.\n\nBecause of this persistent problem and coordinated and extensive research that continues to fail in Ethereum, the analyst thinks Solana is doing much better in handling the impact of MEV bots on gas fees.\n\nSolana currently and actively subsides most of its validators. The subsidy, absent in Ethereum, penalizes operators engaging in MEV operations, discouraging the behavior. Nonetheless, it is crucial to know that the subsidy is on voting costs and not the cost of hardware and operation.\n\nEven so, some think this approach only offers \u201cband-aid\u201d solutions. If anything, they argue that Solana actually \u201cinvented\u201d and \u201cweaponized\u201d MEV. There are other claims that SOL holders like Multicoin Capital prioritize chains based on their MEV capture potential.\n\nRecently, some of these subsidized validators were caught enabling MEV to \u201csandwich\u201d users. While the Solana Foundation swiftly removed their stake, it remains to be seen whether MEV attacks will stop.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "In what is certainly a positive note for the entire industry, the world\u2019s largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), has recently applauded the evolution of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. In a recently published report, the lender praised cryptocurrencies for their importance in an ever-shifting financial landscape.\n\nSpecifically, the bank compared Bitcoin to gold while highlighting its rapid growth in a more digitized economy. Additionally, it called Ethereum \u201cdigital oil\u201d while referencing the power of the ecosystem to power a host of Web3 applications and programs throughout the growing marketplace.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 World's largest bank, ICBC, says \"#Bitcoin retains the scarcity similar to gold.\" June 11, 2024\n\nAlso Read: BTC: Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 in the Next 10 Days, Says Analyst\n\nICBC Praises Bitcoin and Ethereum for Rapid Growth and Evolution\n\nThere is no denying that the digital asset market has been a massive part of 2024 so far. With the midpoint fast approaching, there have already been two crypto-based spot ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Moreover, the prominence of the asset class has surged in recent months.\n\nThat has seemingly caught the attention of the world\u2019s largest bank, ICBC, which has recently applauded the evolution of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Specifically, the world\u2019s leading lender published a report that highlighted what makes these tokens so important and impressive. VanEck head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel went as far as to call the report \u201ca love letter\u201d to BTC and ETH.\n\nThe bank compared Bitcoin to gold, noting that the toke \u201cretains a scarcity similar\u201d to the metal. Throughout 2024, both gold and BTC have surged to all-time highs as they have dominated the investment sector.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency: 3 Coins To Buy Now Before Ethereum Hits $5,000\n\nAlternatively, they noted Ethereum is \u201cdigital oil\u201d in its potential to power applications across Web 3. The bank highlighted how these two assets are growing and evolving to be better used within the market. Specifically, they reference market demand as leading BTC value as an asset to \u201cconsistently\u201d strengthen.\n\nMoreover, they note Ethereum has a similar benefit, in that the asset \u201chas been continually upgrading its technology\u201d in varying areas. The report highlights security, scalability, and sustainability, as the most focused aspects that have yielded impressive returns as far as exposure and adoption.\n\nThese two tokens are currently leading the entire market. They have both received exchange-traded products this year and should continue to grow. This kind of reverence for their trajectory only showcases how mainstream institutions are beginning to value that growth."

Specifically, wallets holding over 10,000 ETH showed growth beginning around the 19th of May.\n\nAt this point, the number of such wallets was approximately 952, and Ethereum was trading at around $3,074.\n\nThe number of wallets holding over 10,000 ETH grew from around 952 to approximately 980 as of this writing.\n\nDespite the ETH price increase to around $3,700, these addresses have continued accumulating more Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, AMBCrypto\u2019s look at the mega whale chart over the last 30 days revealed a noticeable development: the trend has flipped to the upside.\n\nThis indicated an increase in accumulation by most of the major wallets, reflecting heightened buying pressure.\n\nWith this move, it is just a matter of time before the price picks up\u2014a trend that these addresses are betting on.\n\nMore Ethereum flows out of exchanges\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow on CryptoQuant showed that it had been dominated by negative flows in the last few weeks.

However, the RSI is on a downward trend, indicating that a further price decline could push it below the neutral line.\n\nThis means that while the trend is currently bullish, it is weakening."

        "content": "Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December\n\nAs the upcoming elections draw closer, former President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in various sectors, including cryptocurrency, could play a significant role. Many are wondering if Trump is a big crypto investor himself as recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump reached a quick $33 million high last week. According to Arkham, he currently holds 475.6 ETH, worth $1.73 million.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn December 2023, Trump sent over 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens to Coinbase, presumably to sell. At the time, the Ethereum was worth $2.3 million. However, ETH has since performed well, and Trump may regret selling too soon.\n\nIf Trump were still holding all 1,075 ETH he sent to Coinbase, they would be worth around $3.9 million, nearly 60% higher than what he sold them for, as ETH reached higher than $3,600 today. If he held and sold now instead, Trump could have had $1.6 million more in his portfolio.\n\nWith many investment management firms aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, some experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s continued market share growth and its leading status among smart contract platforms could propel its value to a $2.2 trillion market cap, or approximately $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nTrending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nWhile Trump might regret his sale, the ETH was free. He acquired the tokens through an NFT project that utilized his name, image, and likeness, granting Trump royalties through his licensing deals.\n\nThe Trump Digital Trading Cards project was minted in December 2022 for $99 each. The 45,000 unique NFTs feature photos of Trump in different settings and poses. Currently, the cheapest NFT is on sale for a little less than $500 (0.14 ETH), and the most expensive sale goes for 37 ETH (worth nearly $150,000 at the time).\n\nHowever, the Trump NFT projects do not stop there. Trump released another project in late 2023, coined the \"Mugshot Edition,\" a nod to his legal troubles. It offered personalized rewards, with those who bought at least 47 Trump cards getting to have dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago and receiving a piece of the suit Trump wore for his mugshot when he was arrested in August.\n\nAs Trump continues to earn royalties and performs well on the campaign trail, it will be interesting to see how he manages his ETH position going into the presidential election in November. Mark Cuban said earlier this week on X, that crypto could be a big factor in tipping the scale in favor of Trump this November.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Price Reach $70,000 This Week As Ethereum, Solana Scream Buy? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto markets have been swimming in a sea of red in the last few days after Bitcoin price crashed to the $66,000 zone. Investors are now scanning the markets for optimal re-entry positions ahead of the next upward move. Key market-moving events this week include the FOMC meeting on June 12 and the Producer Price Index (PPI) data release on June 13. Market analysts anticipate that Bitcoin will react sharply to these developments.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum and Solana are also preparing for their next upward moves. Here is a complete breakdown of how these assets may perform in the coming days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Price Eyes $72,000 as ETF Volumes Hits ATH\n\nBitcoin price traded around $67,405 during European business hours on Wednesday, a 0.2% drop in the last 24 hours. With just 9 hours to go before the FOMC meeting, Bitcoin is struggling to stay above $67,000.\n\nBTC price action is trending above the 50-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMA), which is a bullish indicator for Bitcoin investors. The June 12 daily candle is also showing signs of a struggle and indecision between the bull and the bears.\n\nThe asset has been trending inside a consolidation zone for the past four weeks. Despite the slide in price, Bitcoin fundamentals remain strong, with BTC Spot ETF total cumulative flow surpassing $292 billion. This signals round 2 of massive accumulation. For comparison, the first round of BTC ETF accumulation saw Bitcoin surge from $38,000 to $73,000.\n\nWith this important metric underway, and with dovish comments from FOMC officials, Bitcoin price may hit and surpass $70,000 this week.\n\nEthereum Price Prepares to Test $3,600\n\nEther dropped by 7.6% to $3,521 over the last 7 days, following the market-wide crash. According to the recent Ethereum price prediction by CoinGape analysts, ETH had previously surged in price after the SEC approved 8 ETH ETFs. However, facts emerging later about the nature of the approved applications killed the hype. BlackRock is still pursuing the approval of its S-1 Form, which many Ethereum investors find bullish.\n\nEthereum price broke downward from a consolidation zone it had been in for about 3 weeks. Initially, the zone was part of a bull flag that usually resolves upwards. However, following Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price, the market structure was invalidated.\n\nEthereum may be preparing to bounce back upward, using $3,300 as support. Investors are waiting for the FOMC outcome in order to make their decisions later today. If bullish news graces the crypto space, Ethereum price may break back into the previous range and touch $4,000.\n\nSolana Price Flashes a Huge Buy Signal, $285 Target in the Works\n\nAlthough the recent general market downturn has affected many cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s price has braced the storm relatively well. Solana price prediction shows the staking token trading around $151 during European business hours on Wednesday, a 2% decrease in 24 hours and a further 12.9% decrease in 7 days. Nevertheless, SOL price action remains bullish and in an uptrend.\n\nSitting at a $69.7 billion market cap, Solana has been dominating the markets. Currently, the price action is trending above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) but below the 50-day moving average.\n\nSOL price has been making higher lows for 275 days straight, an impressive bullish streak. The asset is now in a symmetrical triangle, which may resolve in either direction. However, since Solana\u2019s price is in an uptrend, the chances of resolving upward may be higher than otherwise.\n\nA break above the symmetrical triangle may result in a 59% surge in price that will set the SOL price around $285. This will also be an all-time high price for the asset. Solana network has been an exceptional performer, with nearly half a million tokens launched in May 2024.\n\nOn its way up, SOL price may encounter resistance around $196, $228, and $267. Conversely, $132, $126, and $110 may provide robust support for the asset.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCrypto investors are eagerly awaiting the FOMC announcement in less than 10 hours (at press time). Expert forecasts point to no hikes or cuts, but officials\u2019 comments may either hurt or boost cryptocurrency prices. Investors are hoping for dovish comments from Jerome Powel and his counterparts to avoid further bleeding in the crypto markets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "content": "Crypto traders always look out for the best coin to invest in to earn exciting returns. The emergence of meme coins coupled with the value they possess has made them a great option for many investors and companies who trade in cryptocurrency. As time goes by, many more meme coins are introduced into the space, with each of them striving to be the most valuable.\n\nTop cryptocurrency blockchains are not left out in this race. They have created their version of meme coins which has also gone bullish since their day of launch. Two top blockchains with valuable meme coins in the market space are Tron and Ethereum. Even with the growth of these coins, experts still believe that Raboo, an AI-meme coin yet to be released, is forecasted to be the best meme coin. This is one of the best coins to buy now and is promised to have a boost of 100X its presale token on launch day. So here is your chance to invest in a coin that will give you a greater value in the future.\n\nTron Is Rising\n\nThe meme coins on the Tron chain struggled to show significant growth when they were first released into the market. Despite being a part of a top cryptocurrency blockchain, these Tron chain coins showed low performances and holders found themselves regretting their decision to invest. However, recent market trends show that these coins are finally moving in the positive direction, causing holders to hang on a little.\n\nThe price of Tron has increased by 2.7% over the last week, and currently trades at $0.118. Tron's value is on the rise at the moment but is there a guarantee that it will be maintained? This is a question that bothers the minds of holders investing in the coin.\n\nEthereum Whales Predict An Enormous Rise In Value of ETH Soon\n\nEthereum whales are entities that can influence Ethereum cryptocurrency market because they hold a substantial amount of the coin. They wield a level of power and sometimes try to bend the market to their will. With the recent presale token of Raboo, Ethereum whales have hope for the future.\n\nThe current price of Ethereum is $3,518 and its value dropped by 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Now because Raboo operates under the Ethereum network, it could be great news for the coin. It is expected that ETH moves uptrend following the surge of Raboo, making Ethereum whales excited because they could use this to their advantage.\n\nRaboo: AI - Moneda meme que puede traer retornos masivos\n\nInvestors who are always on the market in search of an opportunity they can jump on, have discovered Raboo. With a cheap presale token of $0.0048 and a potential to rise to 233% before the end of the year, investors are not going to sleep on this offer at all. They believe that Raboo isn't just any coin and with time, they are going to enjoy an exponential return.\n\nRaboo is breaking new ground everyday and experts are running out of words to describe its potential. It is one of the best coins to buy now and you don't have to wait till launch day to start enjoying benefits.\n\n$RABT is an exciting coin with quality features that work with AI to produce memes that bind holders together. It fosters a community of meme coin enthusiasts where they can learn more about the basis of crypto and the growth of the $62 billion meme coin market.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the growth of Tron and the power of Ethereum whales in the market space, investors continue to focus on Raboo which is yet to be released. The potential of this meme coin is enormous and experts believe that it could be one of the leading coins in the future.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here:\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official"

Based on a VanEck analysis, @crypto_birb believes that ETH could be worth $154K (AU$233.5K) by 2030, with a base target of US$22K (AU$33.3K).\n\nVanEck\u2019s target for ETH by 2030, source: Adrian Zdu\u0144czyk via X\n\nAccording to Zdu\u0144czyk and VanEck the optimal crypto portfolio is 70% in BTC and 30% in ETH \u2013 and they say adding 6% of crypto to the standard 60/40 portfolio will boost profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanEck Believes Huge Price Target Driven by US$66 Billion in Free Cash Flows\n\nSo how did the American investment manager come to that lofty price prediction?\n\nIt\u2019s simply a \u201cprojection of Ethereum generating $66 billion in free cash flows by 2030 and applying a 33x valuation multiple\u201d says Zdu\u0144czyk.\n\n2) Portfolio Boost: 6% Crypto Allocation\n\n\n\nAdding 6% crypto to a 60/40 portfolio boosts the Sharpe ratio, with a minor drawdown impact.

The platform\u2019s robust economic activity is further underscored by a settlement value of US$4tn (AU$6tn) and US$5.5tn (AU$8.3tn) in stablecoin transfers, reinforcing these growth figures, he added.\n\nBy 2030 it is expected that 71% of the network revenue will come from finance, based on a strong user base and transaction fees much lower than those of credit card processors and payment apps.\n\nOther bullish forces for ETH are the increasing importance of layer-2 networks and the potential of AI integration.\n\nFurther, Zdu\u0144czyk believes Ethereum will become a Sharpe Ratio leader. The Sharpe Ratio assesses an investment\u2019s performance against a risk-free asset, adjusting for risk; a higher ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe analyst calculates that a portfolio consisting of 71.4% Bitcoin (BTC) and 28.6% Ethereum (ETH) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.43. This indicates that this combination of BTC and ETH provides a favourable balance between expected return and volatility when compared to other potential combinations of these two cryptocurrencies.\n\nSharpe Ratio comparison BTC/ETH, source: @crypto_birb via TradingView\n\nRelated: Analyst Miles Deutscher Unveils 20X Portfolio Strategy for the Upcoming Bull Run\n\nFinal words of warning though, Zdu\u0144czyk says that 2030 is well past his \u201ctimeframe of interest\u201d and in general long-term predictions are obviously fraught with uncertainty. He believes there will be a possibly prolonged bear market in 2026, which is why he will be looking to exit the market in 2025."

For Ethereum, balances dipped below 16 million ETH, valued at under US$59 billion. This trend has been consistent since before July 2020, accelerating post-pandemic and through various market cycles, including the 2021 peak and the 2022 Terra-FTX contagion.\n\nA decline in exchange balances is generally looked at as bullish because it gives the narrative that investors are \u2018holding\u2019 which means they are transferring their coins to private wallets, a process popular in the crypto markets.

AML for Ethereum employs sophisticated algorithms to cross-reference addresses against watch lists and databases containing known fraudulent addresses. This verification process helps detect and prevent transactions involving suspicious parties.\n\nEthereum Address Tracking and Monitoring\n\nTracking and Ethereum address monitoring in real-time are essential aspects of AML compliance. AML solutions continually observe transactions associated with specific Ethereum addresses, instantly flagging suspicious activity. This proactive approach prevents Ethereum fraud and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nSecure Ethereum Transactions\n\nEthereum AML checks protect against fraud and enhance the overall security of transactions on the Ethereum network. By verifying the legitimacy of participants, these checks add an extra layer of trust and transparency to Ethereum transaction security.\n\nPreventing Ethereum Fraud\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has been susceptible to various types of fraud, including Ponzi schemes and phishing attacks. AML solutions for Ethereum are vital in preventing such fraudulent activities by identifying and blocking transactions associated with known scam addresses.\n\nCompliance with the Ethereum Blockchain\n\nAs governments and regulatory bodies worldwide scrutinize cryptocurrency transactions, AML compliance on the Ethereum blockchain becomes increasingly crucial. Cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and other Ethereum-based services are subject to these regulations, and adhering to AML checks is necessary to ensure their legitimacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, understanding AML checks is essential for anyone involved in cryptocurrencies. These checks go beyond preventing fraud; they also contribute to the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of Ethereum as a blockchain platform. As the crypto ecosystem grows, AML compliance remains a fundamental requirement, ensuring that Ethereum remains a secure and trusted space for all users."

A negative CMF value is a sign of market weakness. It suggests capital outflow and indicates a bearish bias toward an asset.\n\nFurther, the negative values of ETH\u2019s Elder-Ray Index confirmed the bearish bias toward the altcoin. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nWhen its value is negative like this, bear power is dominant in the market.\n\nAs of this writing, the value of ETH\u2019s Elder-Ray Index was -209.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIf ETH\u2019s selling momentum mounts, its price may drop below the $3500 territory to exchange hands at $3403.\n\nIf invalidated and bullish sentiment returns to the market, ETH\u2019s price might rally toward $3610."
