        "title": "The Investment Case for Ethereum in 2024 - VanEck",
        "content": "Please note that VanEck has exposure to Ethereum.\n\nSince its release in 2015, Ethereum adoption has grown exponentially, attracting hundreds of millions of users, and gaining the attention of mainstream investment firms and payment applications. As a decentralized platform enabling smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party, Ethereum stands out in the cryptocurrency world. This article evaluates Ethereum\u2019s potential as an investment, considering its unique position and future prospects in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: More Than Just a Cryptocurrency\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology but extends beyond being just a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is central to its operations, differentiating it from other digital currencies. The EVM, a sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each Ethereum node, executed bytecode and smart contracts \u2013 self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, operating without downtime, censorship, or fraud. This innovation shifts the paradigm from traditional contracts requiring intermediaries to automated, trustless transactions.\n\nMarket Dynamics: Assessing Ethereum's Investment Viability\n\nPrice Influences: Market Sentiment and Global Trends\n\nThe price of Ethereum is influenced by market sentiment, driven by news, social media, and overall attitude towards the crypto market, which significantly impacts Ethereum\u2019s price. Positive news about institutional adoption can lead to price surges, while negative sentiment, such as fears of regulatory crackdowns, can cause price drops.\n\nMarket Sentiment: Investor sentiment plays a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market, often driven by news, social media, and overall investor attitude towards the crypto space. For example, positive news about institutional adoption of Ethereum can lead to price surges, as seen when large financial institutions announce their support for Ethereum or when there's a growing interest in decentralized finance platforms built on Ethereum. Conversely, negative sentiment, such as the spreading of unfounded rumors or fears of a regulatory crackdown, can lead to significant price drops.\n\nGlobal Economic Trends: Macroeconomic factors such as inflation rates, interest rates, and economic policies in major economies can significantly impact Ethereum's price. For instance, during times of high inflation, some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum as a hedge against their local currency's devaluation. Similarly, changes in monetary policy, such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like Ethereum.\n\nRegulatory Changes: The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is continually evolving and can have immediate impacts on their prices. Positive regulatory news, such as a country legalizing cryptocurrencies or clarifying tax guidance, can lead to price increases. Conversely, negative regulatory actions, such as bans or restrictive regulations in significant markets like the US, China, or South Korea, can lead to sharp declines in price. For example, China's crackdown on cryptocurrency mining and trading in 2021 led to a significant drop in the price of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTechnological Developments: Advances in Ethereum\u2019s technology or its ecosystem can also influence its price. The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0, with its shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), aimed to reduce transaction fees and increase transaction speed and energy efficiency. Such upgrades can lead to positive price movements as they address scalability and cost issues. However, delays or problems in these technological upgrades can lead to negative market reactions.\n\nHistorical Price Analysis: From Launch to 2024\n\nEthereum has experienced significant volatility since its launch, reflecting market dynamics, technological milestones, and investor sentiment.\n\n2017 Boom: Ethereum\u2019s first major price increase occurred in 2017, peaking at around $1,400 in early 2018, alongside a broader cryptocurrency market boom.\n\n2020-2021 Growth: Significant growth in 2020 and 2021 saw Ethereum reaching new highs above $4,000, driven by its growing adoption and the booming DeFi sector.\n\nCrypto ETFs: The adoption of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has further boosted Ethereum\u2019s price. ETFs provide a regulated way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies, attracting both individual and institutional investors and increasing demand for Ethereum."

        "title": "SEC approves ether ETFs as crypto moves closer to mainstream - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot ethereum exchange traded funds, another landmark for cryptocurrency advocates and investors following the debut of bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThe nine ether ETFs, including the conversion of a $9.3bn Grayscale Investments trust and new launches from bitcoin ETF giants BlackRock and Fidelity, gained approval from the SEC on Monday afternoon, and trading began on Tuesday morning. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain and is the second-largest crypto token in the world behind bitcoin with a market capitalisation of about $415bn. The price of ether ticked up about 1 per cent after trading began on Tuesday and is up more than 47 per cent since January 1.\n\nThe approvals, which follow those of ether futures ETFs last year, give crypto a firmer toehold in traditional US finance after January\u2019s launch of the first US spot bitcoin ETFs. The price of bitcoin was up more than 51 per cent year to date on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cTraditional asset management can no longer ignore crypto as an asset class,\u201d said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of crypto fund sponsor Bitwise. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see effectively everyone embrace this space.\u201d\n\nCboe Global Markets, which lists five of the ether ETFs, said initial trading showed \u201cgood market quality\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll products opened for trading smoothly, with strong participation from our dedicated market makers who have been actively quoting and providing liquidity from the outset,\u201d Cboe said in a statement.\n\nAs was the case with bitcoin, ethereum ETF issuers are jostling for investor interest with a relatively tight range of fees. Final expenses for all but one of the products would be below 0.25 per cent, with at least five issuers planning to entirely waive fees at first, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThere is a glaring exception in the pricing war: Grayscale will keep in place the 2.5 per cent management fee for its large converted ethereum ETF while seeding a \u201cmini\u201d version with 10 per cent of the larger ETF\u2019s assets. The smaller sibling is expected to have the lowest post-waiver fee of the initial ether ETFs at 0.15 per cent.\n\nGrayscale in January also kept the fee for its bitcoin ETF management fee at 1.5 per cent \u2014 down from 2 per cent initially, but still way above its competitors. That decision has generated $160mn in fee revenue for Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin ETF so far in 2024, the third-highest of any US ETF and good for 2 per cent of all US ETF revenue, according to Bryan Armour, Morningstar\u2019s director of passive strategies research.\n\nThese ether products are not initially expected to bring in as many assets as the bitcoin ETFs into which investors have put more than $17bn in new money over the past six months since their launch.\n\nWhile the ethereum blockchain has a wide range of uses beyond storing value, investors might not be able to wrap their heads around it as opposed to bitcoin\u2019s common reference point as \u201cdigital gold\u201d, said Tim Ogilvie, global head of institutional with Kraken, a US cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised if you saw a similar explosive start for ETH,\u201d Ogilvie said.\n\nHougan has predicted that ether ETFs would attract about $15bn over their first 18 months on the market. He added that flows into the new funds \u201ccould be a little squirrelly\u201d in the summer."

        "content": "Cboe Confirms Spot Ethereum ETFs Will Start Trading on July 23\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) has confirmed that several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will commence trading on Tuesday, July 23. Notices posted on Cboe\u2019s website on Friday announced the listing of multiple spot Ethereum ETFs. The ETFs set to begin trading include the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), and VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV).\n\nThis move follows the unexpected approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May, a surprising shift from the regulator's previous scrutiny of Ethereum-focused firms. The approval came just four months after the first spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the United States. Each listing states, \"We are pleased to announce that One (1) Exchange Traded Product ('ETP') will be listed on Cboe and will begin trading as a new issue on July 23, 2024, pending regulatory effectiveness.\"\n\nEthereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has seen significant interest from investors. The approval and upcoming trading of these ETFs are expected to further boost Ethereum's accessibility among traditional investors. According to CoinMarketCap data, ETH is currently trading at $3,529, rebounding from a dip following the sudden news of President Joe Biden exiting the Presidential race. ETH is up 6.21% over the past week.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s initial approvals in May marked a turning point, as the regulator had previously been cautious about Ethereum, seemingly treating it differently from Bitcoin. However, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs likely influenced the SEC\u2019s decision to extend similar approvals to Ethereum ETFs. The SEC recently dropped its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, paving the way for greater regulatory clarity on the second-largest cryptocurrency."

        "title": "Ether ETFs Make Their Bow, With Uncertainty Ahead - PaymentsJournal",
        "content": "Five spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) are slated to begin trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. They follow the nine bitcoin ETFs that began selling earlier this year as the only two cryptocurrency plays available to investors on the regular stock market.\n\nThe new ETFs include the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF. To jumpstart the introduction, virtually all of the ETH ETF issuers have announced plans to temporarily waive or discount their fees. The discounts run from 50% fee reductions to full waivers and will be in place anywhere from six months to a year.\n\nThe bitcoin ETFs have been highly successful, with more than $17 billion in net inflows since their introduction. The ether ETFs will face an uphill climb in replicating that success, with some industry experts expecting them to garner anywhere between 10% and 20% of the inflows garnered by the bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAs a less widely traded asset, ether is expected to endure more price volatility than bitcoin. As the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, ether has a market cap of just over $400 billion, while bitcoin\u2019s market cap is well over $1 trillion. Analysts looking at the ether ETFs are expecting significant price fluctuations after the introduction. For instance, data from research firm Deribit shows that the implied volatility of ether options rose from 56% to 70% in the past week.\n\nNot Mined but Staked\n\nOne key difference between the two cryptocurrencies is that bitcoin is mined, while Ethereum has switched to staking. In September 2022, Ethereum replaced its energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining mechanism with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism rooted more in financial transactions. Technically speaking, Ethereum is the blockchain platform, while ether is the cryptocurrency derived from that platform.\n\nThis change transformed how new Ethereum is created, making traditional mining obsolete. Staking involves committing ether as collateral to validate transactions on the Ethereum network, which allows you to earn more ether.\n\nOne upshot of the ether ETFs is that they will almost certainly increase demand for the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to a severe supply shortage. The Ethereum Exchange Reserve, which tracks the amount of ether available on cryptocurrency exchanges, is already at multi-year lows."

        "content": "For crypto traders, there has long been an arbitrage opportunity in the spread between the price of Bitcoin in the futures market\u2014which is typically more bullish\u2014and the spot market price. The trouble is that taking advantage of this corner of finance, which is known as the cash-and-carry or basis trade, requires considerable time and attention. That\u2019s why Superstate, a crypto firm that specializes in tokenizing conventional financial services, has created its new Crypto Carry Fund that lets wealthy investors get exposure to spreads in the spot and futures market in the form of an Ethereum ERC-20 token.\n\nSuperstate was founded by Robert Leshner, a former banker who is well regarded in the crypto world for building Compound, one of the first and most successful DeFi platforms. In an interview with Fortune, Leshner said some sophisticated investors have for years earned a yield premium on the arbitrage opportunity in spot and future crypto prices. But by creating a token to carry out the trade, he says, Superstate has made the process more accessible\u2014and also more liquid since traders will be able to swap the tokens\u2014known as USCC\u2014with each other.\n\nSuperstate raised $14 million late last year, and launched its first fund in early 2024, offering tokenized versions of familiar products like Treasury Bills. The new Crypto Carry fund will primarily invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum arbitrage opportunities but, during times when the spread does not offer a problem, will put investors\u2019 money in T-bills and other safe investments instead. Unlike hedge funds, there is no lock-in and returns will be available on a daily basis.\n\nSuperstate co-founder Jim Hiltner says the new Superstate fund will charge customers a fee of 75 basis points, and added this a better deal for investors than seeking exposure to the crypto carry trade through hedge funds, which charge a so-called two-and-twenty rate. Hiltner also stated that the fund is structured so that it will not be vulnerable to margin calls, and that it will carry a cash buffer in any case.\n\nThe biggest catch for most investors is that the new fund is only open to so-called qualified purchasers who have $5 million in assets, while the lowest buy-in is for $100,000. The Superstate founders say they hope that, in time, the assets will become more broadly accessible but that, for now, the new fund is groundbreaking because it is totally compliant with existing U.S. regulations.\n\nIn the bigger picture, SuperState is at the vanguard of a growing corner of the crypto industry that seeks to tokenize conventional assets. While firms, including banks, have dabbled with the idea of \u201creal world assets\u201d on the blockchain for years, the idea appears to be finally gaming momentum as Wall Street comes to fully embrace crypto. Indeed, giants of traditional finance are making a push, including Goldman Sachs, which says it will launch three tokenization projects by the end of the year.\n\nLeshner notes that SuperState\u2019s first fund has already amassed $100 million in assets, and that some big names from traditional finance will soon join a recently-launched industry council dedicated to tokenizing real world assets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting exactly the traction we wanted,\u201d says Leshner. \u201cMore important than AUM is that intermediaries such as prime brokers are getting wired into crypto.\u201d"

Given Ethereum's current price of $3,400, that would imply a rally of more than 40% within a relatively short period of time.\n\nThat's certainly possible, given how well Ethereum has performed over the first half of the year. But a lot still needs to go right. Here's a closer look at two key factors that could propel Ethereum to the $5,000 mark by 2025.\n\n1. Continued growth of Ethereum's blockchain ecosystem\n\nFirst and most importantly, Ethereum needs to see continued growth in core segments of its sprawling blockchain ecosystem. One of the most important of these segments is known as decentralized finance (DeFi), which refers to traditional financial products and services reinvented with the help of blockchain technology. As such, DeFi offers the potential for faster, cheaper, and better solutions than those currently offered by traditional Wall Street providers.\n\nIn order to come up with a reasonable future price forecast for Ethereum, it is important first to come up with a ballpark figure for how much market value Ethereum can realistically create over the next few years. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has crunched the numbers and determined that blockchain networks such as Ethereum could potentially generate $5 trillion in new market value by 2030.\n\nThat may sound like a huge, pie-in-the-sky number, but not when you take into account emerging trends such as asset tokenization, which refers to the process of transforming traditional financial instruments into digital assets that live on the blockchain. The faster that the process of asset tokenization takes place, the more valuable Ethereum becomes. According to consulting firm McKinsey, asset tokenization could be a $2 trillion market opportunity by 2030, and Ethereum stands to be a key beneficiary.\n\n2. Mainstream investor acceptance of Ethereum ETFs\n\nEven if you don't buy into the idea of blockchain-powered financial products transforming the modern financial system, there is one other path to Ethereum soaring to the $5,000 mark: the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs, which are scheduled to begin trading this summer. In a bullish scenario, as much as $4.8 billion in new investor money could flow into these new ETFs, helping to boost the price of Ethereum.\n\nTo get a sense of how much of a boost these ETFs may provide, consider the example of the spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.33%) ETFs, which began trading in January. Over the ensuing six months, the price of Bitcoin soared from approximately $45,000 to $70,000, for a gain of nearly 55%. For the sake of argument, let's assume that the new Ethereum ETFs are not as successful as the Bitcoin ETFs, and the gains are not as significant. But even a rally of 40% would still be enough to propel Ethereum to the $5,000 mark by 2025.\n\nIs Ethereum a $2 trillion asset?\n\nIn fact, a price forecast of $5,000 may turn out to be conservative. For example, investment firm VanEck came up with a base-case price forecast of $22,000 for Ethereum for the year 2030. This assumes that Ethereum can continue to make inroads in areas such as DeFi and Web3, and that key blockchain metrics continue to see improvement over the next five years. At a price of $22,000 per coin, Ethereum would have an implied valuation of more than $2 trillion, making it more valuable than all but a handful of companies in the world.\n\nIf you are thinking about investing in Ethereum, keep in mind that crypto can be incredibly volatile and unpredictable. There's always the chance that Ethereum will no longer continue to see rapid gains after a remarkable first decade of growth. Tech issues could prevent it from scaling past a certain point, and the arrival of new competitors could blindside it.\n\nThat being said, if you think that we're on the cusp of a major bull market rally, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar as a cryptocurrency capable of soaring in value over the next several years."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETFs Expected to See a Fraction of Inflows Compared to Bitcoin Funds - Wealth Management",
        "content": "With the SEC\u2019s final authorization of spot Ethereum ETFs now official, trading of the ETFs is set to begin Tuesday morning. There is a buzz about the potential appeal of these new products. However, initial demand from RIAs is expected to be muted.\n\n\u201cWe think if the Ethereum product gets somewhere in the range of 20% of where the Bitcoin products are, that would be a good outcome,\u201d said Aniket Ullal, vice president of ETF data and analytics with research firm CFRA.\n\nRelated: Wealth Management EDGE: Bitcoin ETFs Are Winning Over Skeptics to Crypto\n\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency with a current market cap of approximately $416 billion, second only to Bitcoin, with a market cap of $1.32 trillion. The SEC provisionally approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs in May. The SEC asked the issuers to amend their S-1 filings before giving the final greenlight this afternoon.\n\nOn Friday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) posted notices that several Ethereum ETFs will begin trading on Tuesday, pending final SEC approval, which has now been received. The five funds listed by CBOE include Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH) and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH). The fees on these will range from 0.20% to 0.25%, with most of the issuers planning to waive the fees from six months to a year, depending on the investment amount.\n\nRelated: Several RIAs Take Big Stakes in Bitcoin ETFs\n\nIn addition, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, a futures-based Ethereum ETF (ETHE), would be converted to a spot product with a fee of 2.5%. (Grayscale has separately filed for the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), with a 0.15% expense ratio.) NYSE Arca, meanwhile, has approved both ETHE and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), with trading also beginning tomorrow. Meanwhile, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has been approved by NASDAQ.\n\nWhile market observers expect to see some demand for spot Ethereum ETFs from RIAs, it will likely trail the industry\u2019s appetite to date for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Ullal, there are at least two reasons for this. The first is that Bitcoin products tend to be a more popular choice among investors. Ullal noted that Bitcoin currently represents approximately 53% of the total crypto market, while Ethereum represents only 18%.\n\nIn addition, the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs has tended heavily toward individual investors and very small RIAs. CFRA has no way to gauge the exact breakdown of spot Bitcoin ETF investment between RIAs and individuals acting on their own, but a May analysis of 13F forms filed by asset managers with at least $100 million in AUM revealed they own roughly 15% to 20% of total Bitcoin ETFs shares outstanding. \u201cWe do know that it\u2019s very much a retail demand, just based on our conversations with investors and looking into 13Fs,\u201d said Ullal.\n\nSimilarly, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, forecasts that in the first year after their launch, spot Ethereum ETFs will likely amass a third of the assets that spot Bitcoin ETFs currently have. He noted that it would take time for RIAs to get comfortable with the product and for spot Ethereum ETFs to become available on wealth management platforms.\n\n\u201cThere will be less demand initially,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cOver the next year, we are expecting tens of billions of dollars to flow into these ETFs, but it won\u2019t be immediate. I expect Ethereum ETFs to have a third of the assets that the Bitcoin ETFs have and that reflects the current market cap. As advisors gain more knowledge about the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, the enthusiasm for Ethereum will grow.\u201d\n\nChris King, CEO of Eaglebrook Advisors, a crypto investment platform for RIAs that offers Ethereum and Bitcoin SMAs, agreed with that assessment. He said the majority of RIAs can\u2019t recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs right now, as there are still wealth management platforms that haven\u2019t approved them. As a result, the initial buy-in into Ethereum ETFs will likely come from self-directed retail investors and institutions.\n\n\u201cI think the majority of the initial flows, similar to Bitcoin ETFs, are not going to come from the wealth management channel or the advisor channel,\u201d King said. \u201cIn the short to medium term, it\u2019s not that demand is going to be low; it\u2019s that there is still going to be a little bit of friction to access.\u201d\n\nHowever, King said within about eight to 12 months, the majority of flows into spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETFs might start coming from the wealth channel. During that time, interest rates might fall, more wealth management platforms are likely to approve these ETFs, and upward price momentum is expected if current trends hold.\n\n\u201cI think there is going to be an increasing demand for risk assets, and crypto has typically been the fastest horse in the risk asset race, just like it was in 2020 and 2021,\" King said.\n\nRandy M. Long, a registered financial advisor with Long Family Office, based in Reedley, Calif., noted that his firm already has a positive outlook on spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe very much support these,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWe have invested our portfolios in GBTC and ETHE for a few years now, pretty much before any other firms of which I was aware.\u201d\n\nAccording to the independent research and consultancy firm ETFGI, at the end of June, global listed crypto ETFs and ETPs reported year-to-date inflows of $45.6 billion, the highest level on record and up from roughly $566.6 million during the same period the year before. The jump in inflows reflected the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. At mid-year, there were 68 Bitcoin ETFs/ETPs globally, with total assets of $65.97 billion and net new assets of $45.0 million year-to-date. There were 41 Ethereum ETFs/ETPs, with net new assets of $4.1 billion and net new assets of $116 million."

        "content": "The first-ever Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETFs have been greenlighted by the SEC and are set to begin trading tomorrow morning. Interestingly, two relatively lesser-known Ethereum-branded coins seem to have outperformed the marquee asset in 24-hour gains.\n\nWhat Happened: Ethereum Name Service popped more than 5%, emerging as the best-performing cryptocurrency in the last 24 hours. The coin's trading volume jumped 66% to $191 million, signaling significant buying activity.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum Classic popped 3% to hit a monthly high. ETC's trading volume nearly exploded 184% to $452 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded at 10:44 p.m. EDT) Ethereum Name Service ENS/USD +5.63% $28.08 Ethereum Classic ETC/USD +3.06% $24.78\n\nThese increases come despite a drop in Ethereum, which has lost 1.47% in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Classic was created as a hard fork of the original Ethereum chain back in 2016 over disagreements within the community following a hack. The new chain inherited the name Ethereum as we know it, while the original one functions as Ethereum Classic.\n\nAdditionally, ENS is a token associated with Ethereum Name Service, a decentralized naming system that converts complex, machine-readable names to ones easily understandable by humans.\n\nSee Also: Dogecoin Up 15% In 7 Days And One Indicator Shows It May Be \u2018Primed For An Aggressive Up Move\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: ENS and ETC are fundamentally different from Ethereum, but many retail investors see them as cheaper alternatives.\n\nIt is worth noting that both ENS and ETC have much lower unit prices than ETH. So, while ETH gains popularity among institutions, individual investors may be tempted to shift their focus to lower-cap \u2018Ethereum\u2019 coins\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $67,503 trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:"

        "content": "Daily Email Feature US Spot Ethereum ETFs Due to Start Trading\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the start of trading of spot ethereum exchange-traded funds just six months after spot bitcoin EFTs launched in January this year.\n\nTom Duff Gordon, VP international policy at Coinbase, said in an email that the approval marks a significant milestone in the crypto ecosystem, emphasising the ongoing shift towards the global transition to digital assets. He added: \u201cThis development highlights that crypto is not merely a trend; it illustrates the transformative digital shift in the financial system. We\u2019re proud to be the custodian for eight of the nine newly approved ETH ETFs, entrusted by many leading financial institutions as a reliable,safe, and secure partner.\u201d\n\nHistory often happen gradually, then suddenly. Crypto is no exception. The approval of spot ETH ETFs today is yet another one of those moments. And it validates what we\u2019ve been saying for years: ETH is not a security. https://t.co/1OGfaNr6ro \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) July 22, 2024\n\nThe SEC approved the launch of bitcoin EFTs in January this year when 10 new ETFs began trading and digital asset manager Grayscale Investments also converted its the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. In May this year the SEC also approved spot ethereum ETFs with market participants expecting trading to begin on 23 July 2024. Ether\u2019s $420bn market cap was second only to bitcoin\u2019s $1.3 trillion market cap as of 19 July 2024, according to data provider Morningstar.\n\nIssuers of ethereum ETFs have already listed bitcoin ETFs \u2013 Fidelity, iShares, Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale added Morningstar. The data provider said in a report that WisdomTree and Valkyrie are the two spot bitcoin issuers missing from the spot ethereum list, while 21Shares is issuing its ethereum ETF alone, after joining forces with Ark Invest on its bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments will convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust into an ETF, as it did with its bitcoin trust.\n\nRegardless of your feelings about ether or crypto, this kind of first class TradFi treatment (translating benefits into Boomer-ese and and delivering it in the most preferred inv vehicle on Planet (the ETF) is a major deal.

The ETF carries a 0.25% sponsor fee with a one-year waiver reducing the fee to 0.12% on the first $2.5bn assets under management. The asset manager described ethereum, a global technology platform, as similar to an app store that generates value for ether as usage increases and more applications are built on top of it.\n\nJay Jacobs, U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs at BlackRock, said in a statement: \u201cOur clients are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital assets through exchange-traded products which provide convenient access, liquidity and transparency. Ethereum\u2019s appeal lies in its decentralized nature and its potential to drive digital transformation in finance and other industries.\u201d\n\nAnnouncement: Today, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) became the first U.S. ETP to publish its Ethereum addresses and set ENS subnames for each address. 1.ethw.bitwise.eth -> 0xa15c\u20262A69\n\n2.ethw.bitwise.eth -> 0xEd92\u2026b4eF\n\n3.ethw.bitwise.eth -> 0x3339\u20267cB5\n\n4.ethw.bitwise.eth\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SdOGiXkyqP \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) July 23, 2024\n\nMany of the largest tradfi asset managers in the world are launching crypto ETPs.

As a result, unlike bitcoin, holding ether directly could hold a meaningful performance edge over spot ether ETFs for investors willing to engage in staking.\n\nCrypto ETFs and ETPs listed globally gathered net inflows of $44.5bn through to the end of May this year according to ETFGI, the independent research and consultancy firm. ETFGI said in a report that this is a contrast to the $135.6m of net outflows at the same time last year.\n\nSubstantial inflows can be attributed to the top 20 ETFs/ETPs by net new assets, which collectively gathered $3.1bn during May according to ETFGI. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT US) had the largest individual net inflow of $1.2bn in May.\n\nBlockworks Research said in a report that the majority of the eight issuers filing for the ether ETF have set fees between 0.19% and 0.25%, with the exception of Grayscale. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF will maintain a fee of 2.5%, and the mini trust will offer a 0% fee for the first six months of trading, up to $2bn in assets under management. Then the mini trust will then charge 0.15%, undercutting all the competitors\u2019 currently advertised rates.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the mini trust will be seeded with 10% of trust\u2019s current AUM, and investors will receive a proportional distribution of the mini product at creation,\u201d added Blockworks. \u201cGrayscale is likely moving some of its client\u2019s capital into this lower fee product in an attempt to dampen the exodus of funds that was observed with bitcoin trust\u2019s conversion to an ETF. As trading begins, we\u2019ll get our first glimpse into how well this strategy may work for them.\u201d\n\nLaw firm Foley & Lardner said in a blog that the ether ETF approval is a significant milestone for increased institutional and retail investments in crypto ETFs.\n\n\u201cThe approval of these applications occurred without much resistance, which is a notable departure from the contentious process that preceded the approval of bitcoin ETFs,\u201d added the law firm.\n\nThe SEC was forced to approve bitcoin ETFs after losing a lawsuit against Grayscale Investments, which had challenged their previous rejections. However, the SEC approved ethereum ETFs without a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWhile this maneuver might have been to avoid more litigation and public scrutiny, the approval shows a steady departure from \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d and a movement toward actions that promote growth in the cryptocurrency industry and investor freedom,\u201d added the law firm.\n\nFoley & Lardner highlighted that the SEC noted the high correlation between spot ether prices and the CME\u2019s futures market. Morningstar also added that the SEC is unlikely to approve another spot cryptocurrency ETF without them first having a regulated market, which has so far been the CME futures market.\n\n\u201cThe CME doesn\u2019t currently list any other cryptocurrency futures,\u201d said Morningstar. \u201cIt stands to reason that ETF approval is distant for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and ethereum.\u201d\n\nInstitutional interest\n\nFoley & Lardner said: \u201cIn the coming years, it is very possible we will view the SEC\u2019s decision to approve ether ETFs as an important step in what became a trend of integrating cryptocurrency assets into traditional finance networks through ETFs and other financial instruments.\u201d\n\nCrypto ECN Finery Markets said in its second quarter over-the-counter (OTC) review that the recent approval of crypto-related vehicles has sparked institutional interest in adopting crypto for the long term, demonstrated by the increase in crypto OTC flows. In the first half of this year, the OTC institutional crypto market\u2019s total spot transaction volume rose 95% from the first six months of last year.\n\n\u201cThe approval of ETH ETFs may further drive institutional participation in the market,\u201d added Finery Markets \u201cHowever, we believe that the full impact of ETF approvals on the market may not be fully realized until six to nine months later, as it typically takes this amount of time for innovative products to be fully integrated into financial players\u2019 product portfolios and widely adopted.\u201d\n\nFinery Markets noted that the recent launch of a bitcoin ETF in Australia, and similar launches in the US and Hong Kong, reflect global interest in crypto investment vehicles. In addition, issuer VanEck\u2019s recent application for a Solana ETF highlights this growing trend.\n\nWe at @vaneck_us are pleased to announce that @CBOE just filed our 19b-4 to list and trade shares of the FIRST Solana exchange-traded fund in the US! We look forward to engaging with the SEC during the review period. \u2014 matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 8, 2024\n\n\u201cThese developments signify a changing regulatory environment that is becoming more favorable towards digital assets,\u201d added Finery. \u201cThis shift is important as it provides traditional financial institutions with a clear path to enter the crypto space using established financial instruments, taking advantage of current market conditions.\u201d\n\nFuture trends\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said:\n\nPrediction\u2026 An ETF issuer will file for combined spot btc, eth, & sol ETF in next few months. We\u2019re quickly heading down path towards index-based & actively managed crypto ETFs. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 22, 2024\n\nBrett Harrison, founder and chief executive of Architect Financial Technologies, said:\n\nNow that spot ETH ETFs are set to begin trading next week, a question remains \u2014 what is holding the SEC back from approving spot BTC ETF options?

The derivatives arm of Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group launched FTSE Bitcoin Index futures and options in 2023 and more than 100,000 contracts, equivalent to over $3.5bn in notional, have been traded.\n\nFTSE Russell developed the index with Digital Asset Research. The index captures data from vetted assets and exchanges to meet EU Benchmarks. The final settlement rate of the Eurex contracts is determined as the volume time-weighted average of the FTSE DAR Digital Asset Price over a 15 minute period prior to the fixing time."

        "title": "Ethereum Turns 10: A Decade of Blockchain Revolution - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Over the past ten years, Ethereum has transformed the blockchain landscape.\n\nFrom its initial coin offering to becoming the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum has continuously evolved, implementing major upgrades like the shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Layer 2 scaling solutions and cementing its position as a cornerstone of the Web3 ecosystem despite the emergence of several alternatives over the years.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 10-Year Journey\n\nReflecting on its origins, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) began on July 22, 2014, with the price being 2,000 ETH per sale unit per BTC in a fully permissionless environment devoid of venture capital influence or vesting periods.\n\nThis rate only applied for the first 14 days. After that, the price began to decrease gradually, with each subsequent day offering fewer ETH per unit. By the end of the sale period on September 2, 2014, the rate had dropped to 1337.077 ETH per unit.\n\nFast forward to today, and the value dynamic has shifted dramatically. Now, 1 BTC buys less than 20 ETH. Drake pointed out that few assets have matched Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the past decade, and even fewer have surpassed it by a factor of 100.\n\nEthereum has evolved into a crucial component of the blockchain ecosystem. So far, 4.3 million ETH has been burned for gas fees since the introduction of EIP-1559, and many more are expected to be burned with the introduction of blob transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s staking mechanism now provides $100 billion in economic security, ten times more than Bitcoin, and supports DeFi and restaking, vastly improving the Internet of Value\u2019s economic bandwidth.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Institutional Journey Begins\n\nAll eyes are on the spot Ether ETF, which, according to Drake, further signified Ethereum\u2019s growing recognition as a digital commodity, marking the beginning of the crypto asset\u2019s institutional journey.\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) will debut five spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on July 23, pending final regulatory approval, as announced by the agency last week. This follows the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval on May 23, which greenlighted the listing of several spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThe five Ethereum ETFs scheduled for launch are the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nTo attract investors and secure a market position, most of the ETH ETF issuers are planning to offer temporary fee reductions or waivers as the funds start trading."

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto asset manager Grayscale has transferred a hefty sum of Ethereum to Coinbase Prime as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) associated with the asset gear up for a trading debut in the U.S. this week.\n\nGrayscale's transaction of $1.01 billion to Coinbase Prime on Wednesday prompted market participants to suggest Grayscale might be preparing for a sell-off to reinvest in another crypto, such as Solana.\n\nJon Campagna, managing partner at crypto hedge fund Nexyst Digital and formerly associated with Coinfund and Blackrock, dismissed these claims in a Tuesday post on X, saying Grayscale is unlikely to reallocate its Ethereum holdings.\n\nIt comes as Grayscale tipped 10% of its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) holdings into its separate Ethereum ETF (ETH) on July 18, Campagna explained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new fund is expected to become active on Wednesday, with ETHE holders receiving their proportional ETF positions.\n\nTo facilitate the move, the asset manager transferred $1 billion, or 10% of their $10 billion AUM in ETHE, to Coinbase Prime, as announced a week earlier by Grayscale, Campagna wrote.\n\n\"What will be interesting is to see the outflows from ETHE as they refuse to lower their ... fee,\" Campagna said. \"My guess is those outflows get recycled into inflows into the lower-cost ETFs, like Grayscale's own 15 basis point fee ETH ticker. Brilliant move by them as they quasi-guarantee more assets stay in-house this way.\"\n\n\"Grayscale is not lowering at all,\" Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a post to X on July 18. \"This means they are ten times higher than competition.\" Grayscale is expected to maintain a 2.5% fee on ETHE.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile algorithmic trading firm Wintermute has indicated that the demand for Ethereum ETFs might be lower than expected, analysts remain optimistic about their debut on Wednesday.\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, has said Ethereum could reach as high as $5,000, Decrypt previously reported.\n\nEthereum has already begun to move higher, surpassing $3,500 on July 17 after a significant drop earlier in the month.\n\nGrayscale is among several major investment firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, preparing to launch Ether ETFs.\n\nDemand for the funds is projected to be between $3.2 billion and $4 billion.\n\nEdited by Sebastian Sinclair"

Discover SCENE\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market eagerly anticipates the launch of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), demand may not be as strong as many analysts have predicted, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.\n\nThe expected introduction of Ethereum ETFs comes six months after the successful introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which amassed an impressive $13.8 billion in their first 100 trading days.\n\nWhile the imminent launch of Ether ETFs on July 23 has generated significant interest, market experts are divided on their potential performance.\n\n\u201cAnalysts hold varying views on Ethereum ETFs, with most estimates putting year-one annualized flows in the $4.8-$6.4 billion range,\" a new report by Wintermute stated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm's own analysis, however, suggests a more conservative outlook.\n\n\"Our view is the ETFs will likely see lower-than-anticipated demand, closer to $3.2 to $4 billion,\" the report states. With a \u201cbaseline expectation\u201d that Ethereum ETFs will see 15% to 20% of the flow observed for Bitcoin ETFs, Wintermute forecasts a price increase of 18% to 24%.\n\nThat is lower than some analysts project, with one recently predicting that the price of ETH will hit $5,000 following the launch of Ethereum ETFs, a 50% increase.\n\nThe report attributes this less optimistic forecast to two key factors. First, \"the absence of a staking mechanism diminishing Ethereum's appeal as an ETF vehicle.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe inability to stake Ethereum within these ETFs could make them less attractive to yield-seeking investors who might otherwise be drawn to the potential returns offered by direct Ethereum holdings, the firm said.\n\nSecondly, the report cites \"the lack of a shared narrative to attract investors\" as a potential hurdle for Ether ETFs.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has successfully tapped into the \"digital gold\" narrative, Ethereum's more complex ecosystem and diverse applications may make it challenging to present a unified investment thesis to potential ETF buyers, Wintermute said\u2014noting that Ethereum's flexibility could still appeal to some.\n\n\u201dWithin the ecosystem, Ether operates not only as a digital currency but also as a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis dual functionality has the potential to attract investors who are keen on technological innovations and the diverse applications of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a No-Brainer Buy After the Bitcoin Halving? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "If history is any guide, Ethereum could be on track to post stellar gains during the current Bitcoin halving cycle.\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC -4.33%) halving that took place on April 19 was one of the most eagerly anticipated events of the year for crypto investors. Three previous halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020 have led to spectacular gains for Bitcoin, and the expectation was that this year's halving would kick off yet another bull market cycle.\n\nWhat many investors may not realize, however, is that other cryptocurrencies can also post spectacular gains once the Bitcoin halving cycle starts. One crypto on my radar right now is Ethereum (ETH -7.12%), which could be on track for rapid price appreciation over the next 12 months. Let's take a closer look at why.\n\nBitcoin's impact on the Ethereum ecosystem\n\nKeep in mind that Ethereum is both a cryptocurrency as well as a blockchain ecosystem. This is important, because any new bullish sentiment around Bitcoin tends to benefit the components of these blockchain ecosystems, simply due to the greater interest that investors have in everything crypto-related. This can include everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges, all of which are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn many ways, then, the Bitcoin halving is a rising tide that lifts all blockchain boats. This is exactly what happened during the previous Bitcoin halving cycle that kicked off in May 2020. Growing excitement around the Bitcoin halving led to investors looking for other cryptocurrencies that could benefit, and that naturally led them to Ethereum, which has the largest and most diversified blockchain ecosystem of any cryptocurrency.\n\nAs a result of all the new money flooding into the Ethereum ecosystem from crypto investors, the value of Ethereum began to soar. Over a 12-month period starting from the date of the Bitcoin halving in May 2020, Ethereum soared by more than 1,732%.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that this same phenomenon will occur yet again for Ethereum in 2024. After all, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. But there are simply so many use cases for Ethereum that I'm increasingly confident that investors will find new sources of value within its sprawling blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLaunch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe second reason why Ethereum could soar in the post-halving cycle has to do with the imminent launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission officially gave the go-ahead for these new Ethereum ETFs at the end of May. By coincidence, this happened to line up with the date of the Bitcoin halving in mid-April. So it's now only a matter of time before investor money starts to flow into these ETFs, helping to push up the price of Ethereum.\n\nAdmittedly, there's not as much investor demand for the spot Ethereum ETFs as for the spot Bitcoin ETFs. But as much as $3 billion might flow into these ETFs by the end of 2024. At the very least, this new influx of money would help to soak up any new selling pressure in the crypto market.\n\nHow high can Ethereum go?\n\nThe combination of these two factors could send Ethereum higher over the next 12 months. A growing number of analysts and investors now think that Ethereum could regain its all-time high of $4,891 sometime by the end of 2025. And, from there, Ethereum could soar as high as $22,000 by the year 2030, according to investment firm VanEck.\n\nObviously, a lot needs to go right for Ethereum to skyrocket in value. So keep your eyes on the shifting sentiment around the Bitcoin halving, and how that influences investor perceptions of the value that can be unlocked within blockchain ecosystems. If history is any guide, Ethereum might end up being the no-brainer buy of this Bitcoin halving cycle, just like it was in 2020."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs debut, signaling significant market expansion and institutional acceptance of digital assets.\n\nAnalysts predict ETH price surge, potentially mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s historic rise and impacting financial services.\n\nIn line with our previous update on Grayscale\u2019s Mini Ethereum ETF receiving SEC approval, trading is imminent, starting July 23. The Cboe exchange will launch five new Spot Ethereum ETFs, marking a notable expansion in cryptocurrency investment options.\n\nAs listed in the Cboe listings, five new ETFs will begin trading on July 23: 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETF), the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH), the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH), and the VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV). Detailed in today\u2019s CNF YouTube video below, these ETFs will follow Ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSince Ether is the second-largest digital asset, these ETFs represent a new milestone for U.S. markets, aligning with the SEC\u2019s recent approvals of similar cryptocurrency products.\n\nWill ETH Price Explode?\n\nThis initiative, partly driven by political dynamics in an election year, indicates growing institutional acceptance of digital assets, despite ongoing debates about investor readiness for such innovative investment tools. Analysts are keenly observing, expecting potentially significant impacts on financial services through decentralized smart contract networks, even suggesting ETH could mirror Bitcoin\u2019s 200% surge as reported in a previous CNF report.\n\nAs of now, according to CoinMarketCap data from today, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $3,498.36, having surged by 4.49% in the past week. See the price chart below.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum exchange-traded funds will finally hit U.S. markets tomorrow after the Securities and Exchange Commission said yes to the products in May and signed them off for trading today.\n\nThe Bitcoin equivalent has been a roaring success following its launch in January. The funds\u2014which allow investors to buy shares that track the price of the cryptocurrency\u2014received lots of attention as traditional investors previously spooked by the complex crypto space could finally get exposure to an asset on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nSo will traders repeat the rush and flood the new Ethereum funds with cold, hard cash? Can we look forward to an all-time high price for ETH, as some have predicted?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHold your horses, market experts told Decrypt. Things might take a while to settle out.\n\n\u201cI think the inflows are going to disappoint for the ETH ETFs,\u201d Greg Magadini, derivatives director at blockchain data provider Amberdata, told Decrypt. He pointed to demand for Ethereum futures being \u201clackluster\u201d ahead of the launch.\n\nBefore the Bitcoin ETFs dropped, Magadini said, traders were desperate for exposure to the asset, and the derivatives market\u2014which allowed people to bet on the future price of an asset\u2014was buzzing.\n\nThis is simply not the case this time round. \u201cTherefore the demand for ETH exposure is likely to be underwhelming compared to BTC,\u201d he added.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at Jersey-based asset manager CoinShares, pointed to another potential downside: Grayscale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe top crypto asset manager will launch two products: a main ETF and a mini one. The main one will be a conversion from a fund that operates like a closed-end product to an ETF. ETFs, by their very nature, are easy to cash out of.\n\nIt\u2019s expected, Butterfill told Decrypt, that investors will want to cash out of the main Grayscale ETF as soon as it launches\u2014which is exactly what happened when Grayscale converted its Bitcoin trust into an ETF in January, putting downward pressure on the asset\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely the initial weeks will be marred by outflows from the Grayscale ETH product, in a similar way to the Bitcoin closed-end fund that saw outflows when it became an ETF\u2014investors had been \u2018locked in\u2019 due to the steep discount to net asset value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did add that the approval was positive for the digital asset sector as a whole, and eventually \u201cmay enhance market stability and investor confidence.\u201d\n\nAs for the mini fund, Billy Luedtke, CEO and founder of Ethereum-based authentication protocol Intuition, said that the mini trust could help push the price of ETH up.\n\n\u201cThe [mini trust] offers investors an exchange to the new ETFs without tax liabilities, providing a more attractive fee structure to those who might be skeptical,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cWith reduced barriers to entry, enhanced investor attractiveness through improved fee structures and tax benefits, and increased awareness, substantial inflows into Ethereum can likely be expected.\u201d\n\nFinally, Patrick Felder, Prismatic Capital founder and CIO, told Decrypt that the market is expecting flows of around 15-25% of what we're seeing with the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHe added that if inflows come in stronger than that, \u201cwe\u2019ll see a big move up in ETH price as market expectations reset.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "What is Optimism (OP): Guide to One of Ethereum\u2019s Layer-Two Scaling Solutions - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry, in general, has become much more popular in the past couple of years. This saw the development and launch of hundreds if not thousands, of decentralized applications (dApps) in various fields, such as DeFi, gaming, learning, trading, investing, and so on.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, including but not limited to the massive bull run in 2021, the rise of non-fungible tokens, the popularity of memecoins, and more. This saw hundreds of thousands of users flocking to whatever the next trend may be.\n\nUnlike previous cycles, however, this time, we also saw regular users take advantage of on-chain availabilities and interact with various dApps such as Uniswap, OpenSea, and so forth. And while this had a massively beneficial effect on the industry\u2019s growth and valuation, it also highlighted some very critical issues.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum\u2014where the lion\u2019s share of dApp activity takes place\u2014struggled in terms of affordability, scalability, and even accessibility. Layer one alternatives like Solana also proved insufficiently effective in handling the massive load of user requests.\n\nThis brought up a topic that\u2019s been largely discussed in the cryptocurrency community for years\u2014scalability. Now that scaling solutions have become essentially imperative for the industry\u2019s future growth, projects like Optimism have seen the light of day.\n\nOne of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions, Optimism aims to solve some of the network\u2019s underlying issues, with a particular focus on scaling.\n\nQuick Facts About Optimism\n\nOptimism\u2019s mainnet went live on December 2021\n\nOptimism launched its native token (OP) on May 31st, 2022.\n\nA total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nWhat is Optimism?\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum scaling solution. In essence, its purpose is to help the main network run smoothly by taking some of its transactional load. In technical terms, Optimism is an \u201cOptimistic rollup,\u201d and it\u2019s important to understand what rollups do before diving deeper.\n\nWhat is a Rollup?\n\nRollups are one of the multiple scaling solutions intended to help Ethereum achieve a higher transaction throughput.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation explains that they \u201cperform transaction execution outside layer 1, and then the data is posted to layer 1 where consensus is reached.\u201d\n\nThe main benefit of this is that it reduces the load on the main network while also guaranteeing the broadcasted information by its native security.\n\nThere are two main types of rollups, mainly differentiated by their security models:\n\nZero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups \u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain.\n\n\u2013 these run the computation off-chain and then submit proof of validity to the chain. Optimistic rollups \u2013 these assume that transactions are valid by default and only run computation through fraud-proof if there\u2019s a challenge.\n\nOptimism falls within the second category, and, as you may have probably guessed already, its parent chain is Ethereum.\n\nHow Does Optimism Work?\n\nThe big idea that makes Optimism interesting to most is the Optimistic Rollup. The following is a brief explanation of the concept\u2019s fundamental principles.\n\nHowever, the TLDR is that an Optimistic Rollup is another way of calling a blockchain designed to take advantage of the security of another network that acts as a parent one.\n\nBlock Storage\n\nAll of the blocks on Optimism are stored within a specific smart contract that\u2019s built on Ethereum and is called CannonicalTransactionChain \u2013 CTC to make it easier. They are helped within a list that\u2019s inside of the CTC, and it\u2019s append-only.\n\nThe CTC contains code that guarantees that the current list of blocks can\u2019t be altered by newer transactions on Ethereum. However, this guarantee can be broken if the Ethereum network itself undergoes a reorganization (reorg) and the order is changed.\n\nBlock Production\n\nThe \u2018sequencer\u2019 is the single party that manages block production on Optimism. It helps with the network by delivering the following:\n\nInstant transaction confirmations and state updates;\n\nConstructing and executing layer-two blocks;\n\nSubmitting user transactions to layer one.\n\nIt has no mempool, which means that the transactions are accepted (or rejected) immediately. This happens in the order they are received. When someone sends a transaction, the sequencer will check if it\u2019s valid (pays a sufficient fee) and apply it to the local state as a block that\u2019s pending. These pending blocks are then batched and periodically submitted to Ethereum\u2019s network for finalization.\n\nThe main goal of this batching is to reduce the overall transaction fees by spreading certain fixed costs over all of the transactions within a single batch. Of course, this fee may vary depending on the network load at the time when the transactions were sent to the sequencer.\n\nBlock Execution\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that Ethereum nodes download blocks from Ethereum\u2019s network that\u2019s peer-to-peer. Optimism nodes, on the other hand, download blocks directly from the CTC append-only contract.\n\nTwo primary components make up Optimism nodes: the Ethereum Data Indexer and the Optimism Client Software.\n\nEthereum Data Indexer\n\nIt\u2019s designed to reconstruct the optimism blockchain from blocks that are published to the CTC contract. It\u2019s also called the data transport layer.\n\nOptimism Client Software\n\nThis one closely resembles Geth, which means that Optimism, overall, is very similar in its design to Ethereum. This is also because Optimism shares the same Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), account and state structure, gas metering mechanism, and fee schedule.\n\nFault Proofs\n\nUsing an Optimistic Rollup means that state commitments are published to Ethereum\u2019s network directly without requesting proof of their validity. Fault proofs are requested when a state commitment is challenged. If it\u2019s challenged successfully, it is removed and eventually replaced by another one.\n\nThis documents provide a more in-depth and technical explanation of the terms and overall process described above.\n\nHow to Bridge Assets Between Layers\n\nWith layer-two scaling solutions such as Optimism, being able to swap assets between different layers is obviously of paramount importance.\n\nThere are multiple ways to do it. First and foremost, you can hop on the official website and use the bridge provided there. This would only require you to have a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask.\n\nFrom there, you have to select the network from which you want to bridge tokens. This is the supported list:\n\nThere are also options to bridge from centralized exchanges, but it\u2019s critical to note that these happen through providers that Optimism has simply linked to\u2014meaning there\u2019s no endorsement. You should proceed with caution and after conducting thorough due diligence.\n\nFrom there, the process is particularly simple, as all you need to do is confirm the amount and sign the transaction in your wallet.\n\nThere are a couple of options for bridging assets from optimism. You can use a third-party bridge or the official bridge instead. The following is an example of the latter, but keep in mind that bridging from Optimism to Ethereum takes seven days.\n\nAll you need to do is click the arrow in between the value boxes, and this will switch the above transaction. If you haven\u2019t added Optimism to MetaMask, this will also handle it for you. From there, you only have to confirm the amount and sign the transaction:\n\nGovernance: Optimism\u2019s Model\n\nThe native cryptocurrency of the Optimism ecosystem is the OP token.\n\nOptimism is governed by the so-called Optimism Collective. According to the official website, the collective is:\n\n\u201c\u2026 a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.\u201d\n\nThat said, the governance of the Optimism Collective itself will consist of two separate houses: The Token House and the Citizens\u2019 House. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe Token House\n\nThe launch of the OP token and the Token House set forth the beginning of the governance of Optimism. OP itself was distributed to hundreds of thousands of addresses, who engaged in community-oriented behavior through the first airdrop (more on that later.)\n\nIn any case, members of the Token House are responsible for deliberating, submitting, and voting on various proposals. To do so, OP holders can either vote directly o choose to delegate their voting power to a third party.\n\nIn essence, the Token House votes on proposals of the following types:\n\nProtocol u grades\n\nInflation adjustment\n\nTreasury appropriations\n\nRights protection\n\nGovernance fund grants\n\nThe Citizens\u2019 House\n\nAt its core, the Citizens\u2019 House is an experimental attempt at a non-plutocratic governance model. It is responsible for retroactive public goods funding.\n\nThe above brings us to our next point, which is the OP token.\n\nIntroducing the OP Token\n\nThe OP token was launched through an airdrop, which distributed a total of 5% of the total supply.\n\nThat said, qualifying users included:\n\nDAO voters\n\nMulti-Sig signers\n\nRepeat Optimism users\n\nGitrcoin donors\n\nIf you suspect you are eligible, you can check out any associated wallets on the official claim page.\n\nMany wonder if there will be a new airdrop, and the short answer is \u2013 yes. The team has made it clear that it plans to allocate a total of 19% of the supply for this purpose. Here\u2019s what the overall tokenomics of OP look like:\n\nPlease visit the official website for a more complete look at the economics behind the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nOptimism has quickly become one of the most popular Ethereum scaling solutions. Most recently, the Optimism Foundation released a proposal to upgrade the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, which is a new generation of decentralized Rollup architecture developed by Optimism Labs. Speaking on the matter, the team said:\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the post-Bedrock experience will be a positive change for developers in the Optimism ecosystem and have received consistent excitement for the upgrade from our partners. We are committed to making this upgrade a success and are eager to see the results in the months and years to come.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting to monitor how the different layer twos fare in the coming years as the battle between optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups continues."

        "title": "This week could be explosive for ETH: Ethereum ETFs to debut in the US on Tuesday - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum ETFs set to launch on Tuesday as the SEC declares issuers' prospectus effective.\n\nBitcoin Conference coinciding with ETH ETFs launch week could help drive a rally for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum traders display uncertainty despite bullish predictions surrounding ETH ETFs' launch.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down nearly 1% on Monday as the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed via its website on Tuesday that it has given the final approval for spot ETH ETFs. Considering the ETH ETF launch and the upcoming Bitcoin Conference, this week could prove crucial for Ethereum.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ethereum ETFs, Bitcoin Conference, ETH inflows\n\nEthereum may be set for an explosive week ahead with several potential bullish catalysts on the horizon:\n\nAccording to SEC updates on its website, it has approved the S-1 registratements of spot ETH ETF issuers.\n\n\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\n\n\nThe Exchange NYSE Arca confirmed that it has approval to list and begin trading Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF on Tuesday. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) had earlier revealed that Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Franklin Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF will also begin trading on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin 2024 Conference will kick off on July 25, and with Republican nominee Donald Trump set to discuss a potential US Bitcoin strategy during the conference, Bitcoin is expected to see a brief rally. Many expect ETH to largely benefit from the rise due to its positive correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launching in the same week.\n\n\n\nTraditional investors seem to be bullish on ETH ETFs' launch as Ethereum investment products recorded $45 million in inflows last week, according to CoinShares data. The move brought its year-to-date net flows to $103 million.\n\n\n\nSeveral experts including analysts from Bitwise and Galaxy have predicted that ETH ETFs will see inflows of about $3 billion to $5 billion within the first six months of launch.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum traders are uncertain despite upcoming Tuesday ETH ETF launch\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,460 on Monday, down about 1% on the day. In the past 24 hours, ETH has seen $39.87 million in liquidations, with long and short liquidations accounting for 76% and 24%, respectively.\n\nEthereum is expected to see increased volatility this week following Tuesday's potential launch of ETH ETFs. This is evident in ETH options' implied volatility, which jumped from 56% to 70% last week, according to data from Deribit.\n\nIn addition, ETH options with a notional value of $1.89 billion will expire on Friday. The strike price of these options is heavily concentrated around $3,700, with a Put/Call Ratio (PCR) of 0.45. Since the PCR favors calls, it signifies that most traders are bullish, betting on the price of ETH to rise above $3,700 before the month ends.\n\nEnd-of-month options expiry has triggered a significant decrease in ETH options open interest in the past two months. If a similar move occurs this time around, it may signify uncertainty among ETH investors. ETH futures open interest declining slightly by 1% in the past 24 hours also aligns with the uncertainty among options traders.\n\nAnother key metric to watch is the ETH futures Long/Short Ratio, which is at 0.88. This indicates that a larger portion of ETH futures traders are bearish.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nWith uncertainty brewing in the market despite the confirmation of ETH ETFs' launch, the bullish sentiment from inflows may not be able to trigger a massive rally this week, as many predict. On the upside, ETH could rise by 8% to the $3,731 key level while finding support around $3,205 on the downside."

        "content": "Widely-followed cryptocurrency analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe detailed his altcoin trading strategy, highlighting a substantial allocation to coins in the Ethereum ETH/USD ecosystem.\n\nWhat Happened: In a video shared on his official YouTube channel, Van de Poppe underlined the significance of investing in the right coins amid a hype-based market sentiment. He informed that he's \"heavily\" into the Ether ecosystem.\n\nThe analyst specifically pointed out the high expectations he has from the two Layer-2 network tokens, Arbitrum ARB/USD and Optimism OP/USD.\n\n\"I\u2019m even more interested in them because there is more activity going into the Ethereum ecosystem and due to the spot ETFs, it\u2019s going to be even better,\" he remarked.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin Critic Elizabeth Warren Backs Kamala Harris For Presidency After Biden Withdraws From The Race: \u2018She\u2019s Ready To Step Up\u2019\n\nVan de Poppe revealed that he will continue to HODL these coins at this time as they are vastly undervalued. \"There's no point in selling them quite early.\"\n\nWhy It Matters: This commentary comes a week after Van de Poppe emphasized Ethereum\u2019s low valuation and long-term upside prospects.\n\nHe had predicted that Ethereum would reach a new all-time high faster than the rest of the market and described the upcoming launch of spot ETFs as a major catalyst.\n\nAs things stand, the funds tracking the spot price of Ethereum are set to debut this week, marking a new milestone for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Ether was exchanging hands at $3,508.72 trading mostly flat in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

        "content": "Ethereum whales also known as major investors are gradually returning to the market following recent positive developments around ETH, which demonstrates renewed optimism among institutional and retail investors around the crypto asset. Current data shows that the whales have amassed 426,000 ETH in light of rising excitement over the introduction of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nEthereum Whales Acquires 426,000 ETH In One Week\n\nBurak Kesmeci, a verified author and analyst at leading on-chain analytics provider, CryptoQuant, spotted the recent rise in ETH accumulation among major investors, which has triggered hope within the community about an impending potential price rally for the crypto asset.\n\nAfter observing recent data, the expert reported that Ethereum whales acquired 426,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.4 billion at its current price in one week, particularly between July 22 and July 28. The analyst also pointed out that the whale wallets holding at least 0.1% of the total amount of ETH have continuously displayed positive net flows, throughout the previous month.\n\nAccording to Burak, this spike in accumulation was identified after a price recovery from recent lows below the $3,000 threshold. The expert also attributed the uptick to the frenzy around the launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs last week, garnering significant inflows since its inception.\n\nFollowing the launch of the spot ETFs last week, Blackrock\u2019s fund, ETHA, has seen the highest inflow, recording a net inflow of $442 million. Bitwise\u2019s ETHW, takes the second spot with over $265 million in net inflows, while Fidelity\u2019s FETH saw a net inflow of about $214 million. Despite witnessing significant outflows on day one trading, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE has managed to amass a net inflow of over $164 million.\n\nBurak highlighted that in just 4 trading days, spot Ethereum ETFs excluding ETHE have received investments totaling more than $1.17 billion. Due to the rate of these substantial inflows, Burak is confident that a rally could be on the horizon for ETH as seen with Bitcoin following the inception of spot BTC ETFs in January. \u201cOf course, as adaptation increases and becomes easier, a rally similar to what we see in Bitcoin is expected to occur in ETH,\u201d he stated.\n\nETH Price Begins The Week On A Positive Note\n\nThe price of Ethereum is currently demonstrating positive momentum, triggering sentiment about further gains. After falling to $3,200 on Sunday, the crypto asset has experienced a slight rebound, targeting the $3,400 price level.\n\nThis price rebound might be attributed to the current whale accumulation, as such heightened interest and adoption around a crypto asset is mostly considered a bullish factor that could impact prices.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum has recovered by about 3.90% in the past day, trading at $3,385. Its market cap has attracted an uptick of over 3.71%, but its trading volume is still displaying negative sentiment, falling by more than 19% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from LinkedIn, chart from Tradingview.com"

Moreover, the market is hopeful it can mirror Bitcoin\u2019s success. The leading cryptocurrency debuted its ETF in January. Just three months later, the BTC reached an all-time high price of $73,000.\n\nThe decision caps a years-long process to get ether ETFs approved by the SEC, giving investors a new crypto asset to invest in. Ether ETF applicants first received 19b-4 form approvals back in May. However, many delays on the SEC\u2019s end in looking over the final documents occurred. Now, we are less than 24 hours away from the first trades of a Spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Is ETH a Lock for $4,000 After ETF Launch?\n\nHow Will Ethereum Perform Against Bitcoin After Spot ETF Launch?\n\nFurthermore, an interesting note is the timing of the approval. The SEC is greenlighting the launch date of the Ethereum ETF during the biggest Bitcoin conference of the year. This week isn\u2019t just about Bitcoin anymore, as Ethereum is joining the spotlight with its ETF launch tomorrow. BTC and ETH represent the only two cryptocurrencies with an ETF in the US, but more are expected to be launched in the coming year. The first Solana SOL-based ETFs have already gotten applications sent out, and other cryptocurrencies like XRP expect to join the ETF conversation as well.\n\nCboe will house most of the first trading of Ether ETFs, with more exchanges likely jumping in shortly after trading commences. Upon the Ethereum ETFs\u2019 debuts, the entire cryptocurrency market expects to jump as it did following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January."

When funding rates exceed 1.2% per week, it can indicate that the crypto market is overheating and likely to correct. Currently, the funding rate is at 0.04%, or about 0.8% on a weekly basis. This could indicate moderate but noteworthy growth.\n\nExperts agree that ETH could see significant growth in the coming weeks. According to some analyses, ETH price could reach around $6,216.99 by the end of 2024. Other long-term forecasts suggest that ETH could reach up to $40,000 by 2030. These predictions are based on the growing adoption of dApps and continuous improvements in blockchain technology.\n\nCurrent data from the Ethereum futures market shows a moderately bullish trend! Supported by high open interest and an increasing buy ratio. However, investors must remain vigilant for signs of excessive optimism that could precede corrections. By closely monitoring key indicators and staying informed on crypto market trends, investors can better navigate the volatile environment of Ethereum futures.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

The crypto market has seen a significant shift in investor confidence. The newly-refreshed optimism is shown in the $14 billion trading volume.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s price charts show a significant breakthrough. The 24-hour chart shows considerable volatility, with ETH prices going between $3420 and $3560.\n\nSeeing this surge go past key resistance levels has captured the attention of traders, and this could, in turn, attract more market participants.\n\nBroader Crypto Trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s strong performance is a sign that the whole cryptocurrency market is doing well. The 7-day chart shows ETH prices moving between $3,300 and $3,550, showing ongoing interest.

While the current surge is impressive, it\u2019s essential to be careful with cryptocurrency markets as they can change quickly.\n\nETH Price Projections\n\nWhile no one can predict prices with certainty, some experts have suggested the following:\n\nShort-term (1-3 months): ETH might reach $4,000 if it keeps increasing. Medium-term (6-12 months): ETH could hit $5,000-$7,000. Long-term (2-5 years): A few optimistic guesses say ETH could go to $10,000 or higher. Very long-term (5-10 years): Some analysts believe ETH could reach $20,000-$50,000, citing increased adoption, technological advancements, and the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nEthereum\u2019s big jump past $2,000 and the $14 billion in trading volume are important milestones.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu and Ethereum: Price Prediction Analysis\n\nWhile the surge and future guesses are exciting, staying cautious is best.

        "content": "With the leading cryptocurrency performing well last week, all eyes are on if Bitcoin can capitalize on the arrival of Spot Ethereum ETFs. The investment products are confirmed to launch Tuesday. Could that serve as the catalyst for Bitcoin returning to the $70,000 mark?\n\nThe asset is currently just 8% away from that notable price point. Over the last seven days, the crypto has increased by more than 7%, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin last surpassed the crucial $70,000 mark in March of this year, reaching an all-time high of $73,000.\n\nSource: Watcher.Guru\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF: BlackRock Reveals 0.25% Fee in Updated Filings\n\nCan Ethereum ETF Lead Bitcoin Back to $70,000?\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg earlier this month, Kraken executive Thomas Perfumo called the ETH ETF arrival a \u201crising tides lifts all boast story.\u201d He reiterated that the investment product is \u201ca big deal,\u201d while noting it is set to bring both attention and \u201ccapital flows,\u201d to the asset class.\n\nThat could be good news for the leading crypto. Indeed, Bitcoin may continue its positive performance when the Ethereum ETFs debut, as it looks to target $70,000. Although it has retreated slightly, the token reached the $68,000 mark on Monday. That could set the tone for a continued increase.\n\nThe token did fall some on Sunday. US President Joe Biden\u2019s announcement of his withdrawal from the 2024 election led to $159 million being liquidated in futures contracts, according to Coinglass. However, that didn\u2019t stop Bitcoin from facing a notable comeback to its current price.\n\nSource: Watcher.Guru\n\nAlso Read: Donald Trump\u2019s $844K Bitcoin Roundtable: Worth It?\n\nBRN Analyst Valentin Fournier believes market volatility will lead to a price surge. \u201cIf this trend persists, Bitcoin could cross $70,000 tomorrow with the launch of Ethereum ETFs,\u201d the analyst told Decrypt. \u201cAlthough a parabolic acceleration for Bitcoin seems unlikely at this time, positive ETF inflows could sustain the rally longer than previously expected.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing macroeconomic factors could also play a role. Although BTC is not expected to reach the heights it had hit in March, it is still expected to react positively. A surge to $70,000 should not be ruled out by traders. Yet, how long it lasts at that level is the most important question."

Traders are on high alert with Ethereum price analysis revealing that a breakout above $4,000 could be inbound not to mention the possibility of ETH reaching new record highs.\n\nA notable 2.3% increase in the last seven precedes the launch of ETFs. However, due to resistance at $3,500, bulls must be deliberate when pushing for a breakout. Should whales decide to sell ETH following the event, a short-lived fall to $3,200 may come first before the next major trend reversal.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Whales Deposit Into Exchanges Ahead Of ETF Launch\n\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) unveiled last week that five spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will start trading on the platform on July 23 with the only condition being \u201cpending regulatory effectiveness.\u201d\n\nIn May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) licensed rule changes allowing the exchanges to list several spot Ethereum ETFs. Despite the achievement, the agency needed time to sign off on all the operators\u2019 S-1 registration documents.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s developments, the list of the spot ETH ETFs expected to start trading on Tuesday includes Franklin Ethereum ETF, 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn preparation for the live trading, Ether ETF issuers have announced a raft of measures including temporarily waving and discounting fees to gain the first mover advantage.\n\nIt has been estimated the Ethereum ETFs will attract fund inflows in billions over the next few months. With such a trend, Ethereum price could gain tracking taking out the $4,000 resistance in the quest for a new record high above $5,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum whales seem to preparing for a sell-the-news event considering noticeable blockchain activity in the last 9 days. According to Spot On Chain, two large-volume investors transferred 25,865 ETH worth approximately $89 million to centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nThe first investor whose address starts with 0xbec moved 11,965 ETH to Binance worth around $41.4 million at an exchange rate of $3,457.

        "content": "Ethereum has been experiencing a prolonged period of bearish price action. The altcoin has been relatively quiet, with its price declining, leaving many investors and traders feeling uncertain. However, a notable bullish proponent continues behind the scenes, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics.\n\nIn the last few days, on-chain data has revealed a significant accumulation pattern for ETH. This bullish catalyst has materialized in the form of whale accumulation, where large investors, commonly called \u201cwhales,\u201d have been making substantial purchases of Ethereum. These whales have acquired hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH, signaling their anticipation of an imminent price surge.\n\nEthereum Whales Buy $440 Million Worth Of ETH\n\nThis intriguing accumulation pattern was brought to light on social media platform X by renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez. According to the data shared by Martinez from CryptoQuant, Ethereum whales have recently made a significant move by accumulating 126,000 ETH, valued at approximately $440 million, within a remarkably short span of 48 hours.\n\nThe CryptoQuant analysis chart revealed that this buying trend was primarily driven by addresses holding more than 100,000 ETH each, classifying them as ultra-whales. These ultra-whales represent the most influential and substantial investors in the Ethereum market, and their activities often have a pronounced impact on market trends and investor sentiment.\n\nFurther analysis of the chart indicates a notable increase in the total balance held by this elite group of traders. On June 28, the cumulative holdings of these ultra-whales stood at around 5.1 million ETH. However, by June 30, this figure had surged to over 5.23 million ETH. This upward trajectory in holdings becomes even more pronounced when we consider the balance from an earlier point, which was 5.05 million ETH on July 22.\n\nWhy The Accumulation?\n\nThe accumulation can be attributed to whales positioning themselves for a well-anticipated bull run in light of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Investors are beginning to perceive a shift in these spot ETFs, with collective inflows into other Ethereum ETFs starting to outpace outflows from Grayscale\u2019s ETHE.\n\nThe launch of these Spot Ethereum ETFs has yet to translate into a price rally for Ethereum. Their launch has kicked off a sell-the-news event. Since launch, ETH has experienced a decline of approximately 12.8% and recently bottomed at $3,090. Despite this downturn, many analysts maintain a bullish sentiment for Ethereum. This shows that investor confidence remains strong, even if this sentiment is largely psychological.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,150. On-chain buying trend shows that many whales are preparing for an altcoin rally that\u2019s set to be spearheaded by Ethereum. On-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals that limit buy order volumes for altcoins are increasing across various exchanges. This has caused the creation of huge buy walls, which in turn reflect preparations for an altcoin rally.\n\nFeatured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Polygon network has seen a surge in RWA interest, including a recent ECB trial.\n\nMATIC traction on the price charts has slowed slightly, with $0.51 as a key price level.\n\nPolygon [MATIC] founder Sandeep Nailwal has acknowledged rising Real World Asset (RWA) interest in the Ethereum [ETH] L2 network. His remarks followed the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) recent bond issuance trial.\n\n\u2018So many RWA\u2019s launching on Polygon organically is very encouraging\u2026Polygon POS is already second only to Ethereum mainnet in terms of the RWA value created.\u2019\n\nHowever, according to RWA.xyz data, the statement was overstated. The platform showed that Polygon was the fifth-largest network based on total market cap, especially in the US tokenized securities market.\n\nWill the RWA interest boost MATIC price?\n\nThe rising RWA interest revealed some positive network effects, as denoted by a surge in MATIC\u2019s daily active addresses, per Sentiment data.\n\nAdditionally, the news update on the ECB trial on the network flipped MATIC\u2019s Weighted Sentiment to positive. However, the metric dropped towards the neutral level as of press time, which could dent market sentiment on MATIC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the daily active address also tanked, which could derail further price upside with fewer users engaging with the altcoin.\n\nMATIC recovery cooled off\n\nOn the price front, MATIC surged 3% on 19th July after Nailwal\u2019s remarks. However, MATIC\u2019s overall recovery in July stalled above $0.55 and retraced to $0.51. The mixed reading on key price chart indicators signaled traders\u2019 caution.\n\nNotably, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) recovered but remained muted below the average level (50). It meant that the recent recovery didn\u2019t gather enough buying pressure to guarantee a stronger upside.\n\nAdditionally, CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) was above average but hovered near the equilibrium level, denoting inflows surged but stagnated in the past few days.\n\nThe above readings suggested that MATIC could struggle to break the overhead hurdle and daily order block above $0.55 (red).\n\nHowever, the $0.51 level was also a crucial demand interest level, as shown by the chart and whale order data.\n\nThe bounce at $0.51 was marked by about $26 million in buy orders in the derivatives market on Binance exchange. Additionally, demand surged in the MATIC spot market, with over $500K in bids at the level.\n\nHence, given the whale interest and massive volume at $0.51, it was a crucial level for any MATIC speculator looking for market entry into the altcoin."

        "content": "Mon 22 Jul 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nBetween revolutionary announcements, technological developments, and regulatory turmoil, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a limitless territory of innovation and a battlefield of regulatory and economic battles. Here is a summary of the most notable news from the past week around Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.\n\nBitcoin surpasses Visa and Mastercard in transaction volume\n\nBitcoin has reached a historic milestone by surpassing Visa and Mastercard in terms of daily transaction volume. According to data from Glassnode, the leading crypto asset recorded a volume of $46.4 billion, compared to $6.5 billion for filtered economic transactions. This surge is due to increasing adoption and innovations such as the Runes protocol. With a market capitalization of about $1.3 trillion, Bitcoin is redefining traditional payment systems.\n\nBinance can invest in US Treasury bonds\n\nThe world\u2019s leading crypto exchange, Binance has received approval to invest customer funds in US Treasury bonds. This strategic decision allows the company to diversify investment options for its users. It offers greater security and stability compared to more volatile crypto assets. The announcement also led to a notable increase in the price of Binance Coin (BNB). This reflects investor confidence in Binance\u2019s fund management and paves the way for similar initiatives.\n\nJD Vance: Trump\u2019s Pro-Bitcoin Running Mate for 2024\n\nDonald Trump has chosen Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Vance, known for his support of cryptocurrencies, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in Bitcoin and advocates for a crypto-friendly legislative framework. This nomination aims to attract the crypto-enthusiast electorate and marks a pro-crypto shift for Trump, who now accepts cryptocurrency donations for his campaign.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF hits the market on July 23\n\nThe long-awaited launch of the first spot Ethereum ETFs is scheduled for July 23, 2024, according to a recent confirmation from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe). Listed funds include the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). These ETFs offer a regulated and secure option to invest in Ethereum. They could attract more institutional investors and strengthen the legitimacy of the crypto market.\n\nWhale transactions destabilize XRP price\n\nRecent massive XRP transactions made by whales have caused significant volatility in the token\u2019s price. After accumulating more than 130 million, these investors managed to push the price of XRP to 63 cents. However, the crypto asset\u2019s price then fell by 8% to around 55.8 cents. These large holders\u2019 significant movements demonstrate their direct impact on the market and the difficulty in maintaining price stability in the short term.\n\nThat\u2019s the essentials to remember for this week.

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs have racked up around $1.24 billion in inflows over the past week as spot markets recover.\n\nPreliminary figures from Farside Investors suggest that Friday, July 19, saw inflows of $384 million, with Fidelity leading the pack at $140 million inflows.\n\nThis marks eleven consecutive trading days with a positive flow to these institutional investment products. Even Grayscale saw an inflow of $20 million to its GBTC spot ETF on Friday, the first positive flow day for the fund for a week.\n\nEthereum ETF Dates\n\nOn July 19, the CBOE announced that five spot Ethereum ETFs will begin trading on July 23, \u201cpending regulatory effectiveness.\u201d\n\nThe five products set to start trading next week are the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nCboe new listings\u2026 It\u2019s happening.

Existing ETHE shareholders will receive a proportional distribution of shares in its new Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) on July 31.\n\nOn July 19, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that from a value point of view, \u201ca theoretical person has $1,000 in ETHE or GBTC.

The eight approved digital products are likely to go live on the Chicago Board Option Exchange (Cboe) and NYSE Arca on July 23.\n\nKey Developments and Expectations\n\nJames Seyffart, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst in an explanatory post on X regarding the much anticipated digital asset, shared what investors and stakeholders can expect once spot Ethereum ETF begins trading. One of the notable developments will be on the official website of the SEC.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat are we expecting today for the Ethereum ETFs? We expect them to begin trading tomorrow.

Here are the race entrants: pic.twitter.com/AkBxEjBRvv \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 22, 2024\n\nAccording to Seyffart, after the close of market on July 22, the SEC website will have to update its platform with new filings. The update will signal to the global community that the ETFs prospectuses are now effective.\n\nNotably, the entrants on the Cboe include Franklin Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum ETF and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF. Each of the aforementioned have a waiver on transaction fees ranging from six months to one year except Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF with no waiver granted by the issuer.\n\nAdditionally, the five issuers trading on the Cboe have Coinbase as their custodian with the exception of VanEck Ethereum ETF. Gemini will serve as the custodian for VanEck.\n\nImplications of Spot Ethereum ETF Launch\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, Bitwise Ethereum ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Trust will be trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The trio also have Coinbase as their custodian.\n\nThe broader crypto community will be keenly watching the milestone event when trading goes live, particularly, investors in Ethereum ETF and how it will impact on the price of ETH. Principally, stakeholders will be interested to see if the development will cause market excitement with visible trading surge.\n\nWhile there have been several bullish predictions for the effect trading of spot Ethereum will have on price, some analysts consider the SEC\u2019s approval and listing for trading a major win already.

        "content": "Ethereum has been on the verge of surging past the $3.5k resistance level over the last five days\n\nTraders can anticipate a rally towards $3.9k, but chances of a bearish reversal thereafter would solidify\n\nEthereum [ETH], at the time of writing, was trading below the $3.5k-$3.6k resistance zone. Its momentum has stalled over the past week. In fact, a recent report revealed that the taker buy-sell ratio fell below 1 too.\n\nThis indicated a reduction in buying pressure in recent days.\n\nThe daily RSI signaled bullish momentum, but the OBV was closer to the lows of a range from May. This was not a good sign for the bulls.\n\nHence, AMBCrypto investigated whether the on-chain metrics leaned bearishly or bullishly.\n\nRecent positive netflows explain stalled momentum\n\nThe exchange netflow data revealed that over the past week, 57.98k ETH flowed into exchanges. Over the past month, 70.11k ETH flowed in.\n\nThis meant more inflows than outflows, which in turn precipitated potentially greater selling pressure in the altcoin\u2019s market.\n\nAdditionally, the in/out of the money graph revealed that by volume, the $3171-$3276 zone was the strongest demand zone.\n\nMeanwhile, the $3.5k and $3.7k resistance levels might pose as opposition to the market\u2019s bulls.\n\nOn-chain metrics underline Ethereum\u2019s stagnancy\n\nThe 180-day mean dollar invested age (MDIA) metric has been trending higher since April. A prolonged uptrend is not welcome as it indicates reduced network activity and investments getting stagnant.\n\nOn the other hand, the development activity has been robust regardless of ETH\u2019s price trend, which long-term investors would appreciate.\n\nThe daily active addresses and network growth saw a spike on 22 June, but both metrics have receded since. The age-consumed metric has also been quiet over the past week.\n\nOverall, the metrics showed that Ethereum would have a tough time climbing past the $3.6k-$3.7k resistance.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThis point was reinforced by AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the liquidation heatmap. After sweeping the pool of liquidity at $2.8k, Ethereum has rebounded healthily. Two liquidity clusters at $3.7k and $3.9k loomed ahead.\n\nIt could attract prices to them and reverse the trend, just as investors get excited about the potential for Ethereum to break the $4k resistance level."

        "content": "Mt Gox, the infamous Bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014, appears to be gearing up for a significant repayment to its long-waiting creditors. This development comes at a crucial time, coinciding with the imminent launch of Ethereum ETFs. The intersection of these two events has sparked intense speculation about their potential impact on the crypto market, particularly on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.\n\nMt Gox Prepares for Major Bitcoin Repayment\n\nAccording to data sourced from Arkham, Mt Gox has recently caught the attention of on-chain analysts with a series of small Bitcoin transfers. The most recent transaction involved 0.021 BTC (valued at approximately $1,390 USD) sent to an address 1C9Vo\u2026t81Fa. This transfer occurred just minutes before the report was issued and mirrors a similar transaction made exactly six days prior.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese micro-transactions are believed to be part of a testing phase for their transfer capabilities. The duplicate nature of these transactions, both involving 0.021 BTC from a Mt Gox-associated address, was also confirmed by Arkham. Speculations have arisen stating that these small-scale transfers could be a precursor to larger movements.\n\nThe cautious approach adopted is particularly noteworthy given the exchange\u2019s troubled history and the significant assets still under its control. Reports indicate that their related addresses hold approximately 138,000 BTC, currently valued at around $8.91 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Real Bedford FC Purchases Additional $4.5 Million Worth of Bitcoins\n\nEthereum ETF Launch and Market Outlook\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is showing strong signs of recovery, buoyed by bullish sentiment surrounding the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum ETFs on July 23. This optimism has been further fueled by predictions from industry experts like Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, who suggests that the market may soon see the filing of a combined spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETF.\n\nThis development has contributed to the overall positive market sentiment, Bitcoin price surpassed $68,000 but however trades at $67,346.8 and Ethereum price on the other hand rose above $3,550 but has also slightly dropped, trading at $3,496. All these come in anticipation of the spot Ethereum ETF launch. The market\u2019s enthusiasm is reflected in the significant increase in total cryptocurrency trading volume, which has risen by more than 43% over the last 24 hours.\n\nAs the launch date for Ethereum ETFs approaches, market participants are closely watching for potential shifts in investment patterns and regulatory responses that could shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption and integration into traditional financial systems.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple CTO David Schwartz Bets on Joe Biden\u2019s Replacement for Crypto Vote\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Crypto market will see a Trio of combined Spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, and SOL soon.\n\nSpot crypto ETFs have rapidly drawn billions from investors, reflecting high interest.\n\nCombined ETFs could offer diversified exposure, increasing demand and reducing risk.\n\nSolana (SOL), the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has established itself alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of crypto\u2019s Big Three. With Bitcoin and Ethereum already having spot ETFs or about to launch them, it\u2019s likely that Solana will get one too. This could significantly impact SOL, potentially even greater than what we\u2019ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nNate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, has speculated that issuers might soon pursue a combination of spot ETFs encompassing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This prediction highlights the growing anticipation surrounding multi-crypto ETFs.\n\nCould this be the next big thing?\n\nThe Surge of Spot Crypto ETFs\n\n2024 has been a landmark year for spot crypto ETFs, which have captivated the market and attracted billions from eager investors. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11 injected fresh optimism into the crypto space, paving the way for similar offerings for Ethereum. The success of Bitcoin ETFs has not only sparked increased investor interest in Ethereum but has also driven Bitcoin prices up to $74,000.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched, more crypto exchange-traded products are now possible, including a potential ETF for Solana. The success of these initial ETFs shows that investors are eager for more options and managed crypto investments.\n\nThe Industry is Changing\n\nIn a recent tweet post, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, believes that issuers may soon apply for combination spot ETFs that include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nPrediction\u2026\n\n\n\nAn ETF issuer will file for combined spot btc, eth, & sol ETF in next few months.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re quickly heading down path towards index-based & actively managed crypto ETFs. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 22, 2024\n\nThis move is expected to offer investors a diversified exposure to the top-performing digital assets, reflecting the growing interest and maturity in the crypto market.\n\nGeraci further noted that the ETF industry is swiftly moving towards the adoption of both index-based and actively managed cryptocurrency ETFs. This transition reflects a growing demand for diversified and strategically managed crypto investment options.\n\nBy combining major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a single ETF, investors would gain exposure to a broader range of assets, potentially reducing risk and increasing investment appeal.\n\nPositive Signs for the Markets\n\nThe rise of crypto ETFs marks a big shift, changing the view of crypto from just a speculative asset to a key part of investment portfolios. More involvement from financial institutions adds credibility to crypto assets.\n\nThis positive development has boosted the crypto market, with Bitcoin trading at $67,878. Meanwhile, Ethereum is hovering around $3,514, and Solana is trading at $181.\n\nAlso Check Out: SOL Price Prediction: Post 40% Jump, Solana Eyes $200 Break To Hit $250!\n\nSolana is gaining traction.

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nEthereum ETF Launch is Just a Few Moments Away: Will This Be the Turning Point for the ETH Price Rally?\n\nStory Highlights The spot Ethereum ETF is expected to launch in the next 24 hours, while the ETH price consolidated below $3500\n\nThe historical pattern suggests the price has experienced a significant drop after each event and hence a similar pattern is feared to reciprocate\n\nThe Ethereum price is testing one of the crucial supports after the bears intensified their activity since the start of the day. Besides the market, participants remain vigilant ahead of the spot Ethereum ETF launch as they continue to hold crucial support. With this, the possibility of a major swing continues to prevail over the Ethereum price rally, but at the same time, the probability of a fakeout also haunts the rally.\n\nThe weekly chart displays that the price continues to trade within a pattern and hence it suggests that one final dip may begin a parabolic run towards a new ATH, maybe to a 5-digit figure. The ETH ETF is set to go live in the next 48 hours, and the sentiments have absorbed the Bitcoin selloff from the German government. Therefore, the launch is expected could bring new money and energy into the crypto space. Amid the bullish sentiments, is the ETH price prone to a pullback before the launch?\n\nAfter the bullish weekend close, the ETH price reached one of the crucial price zones which may trigger a 30% rise as it happened earlier in February. Previously, the price marked a pivotal resistance and consolidated for a range which triggered a massive run to mark a yearly high above $4000. Therefore, the upcoming price action suggests, that even if the price breaks the support at $3486, it may drag the price with a small range as the bulls could hold a strong base at $3350.\n\nThe MACD is displaying a drop in the selling pressure but the DMI is neutral, remaining within the bearish range. Although the +Di & -Di underwent a bullish close, the levels failed to maintain an ascending trend while the ADX continued to trade towards the south. On the other hand, the Ichimoku cloud is close to turning bullish which is flashing huge bullish signals for the upcoming ETH price rally.\n\nThe launch of the spot ETH ETF is expected to have a nominal impact on its price and also on the entire market. However, after a small pullback, the journey towards a new ATH above $5000 may be imminent."
