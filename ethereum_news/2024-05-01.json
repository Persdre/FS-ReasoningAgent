        "title": "The SEC has Ethereum in its crosshairs. But does the agency think Ether is a security? - Fortune",
        "content": "For weeks, speculation has mounted that the Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to cross the crypto Rubicon and declare Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, a security. As the deadline looms for a decision on spot Ether ETFs, the move seems like the last option for an agency seemingly determined to find reasons to reject crypto products, even though prior, high-ranking staffers had argued that Ether was a commodity and out of its wheelhouse. The implications would be catastrophic for the broader crypto industry, with even mainstays like Fidelity offering trading services for Ether.\n\nConfirmation appeared to come last Thursday when Consensys\u2014an early developer for Ethereum, and the company behind the popular MetaMask wallet\u2014filed a lawsuit against the SEC, revealing it had received a Wells Notice and had been the subject of a yearlong investigation into Ethereum\u2019s security status. And then, on Monday, Consensys refiled its complaint, unredacting certain sections that had hinted the SEC officially believed Ether to be a security. The smoking gun, it turned out, was a formal order opening an investigation, signed by enforcement director Gurbir Grewal in April 2023, into the possible offers and sales of \u201ccertain securities, including, but not limited to ETH.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited proof was explosive. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has refused to take a stance on Ether\u2019s security status, including under questioning by House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) just a few days after the secret formal order, as well as when I interviewed him last November. Despite that lack of clarity, the SEC allowed the launch of Ether futures ETFs last October, which implies a view that Ether is not an unregistered security. Furthermore, despite launching a number of lawsuits against crypto companies since April 2023, the agency has never named Ether to be a security in its complaints. Predictably, the revelation drew rage from the crypto industry and beyond, with McHenry tweeting that Gensler \u201cknowingly misled Congress.\u201d\n\nThe whole situation seemed strange, even by the bizarro standards of the SEC versus crypto war, where reality is often obscured behind layers of bluster and exaggeration. Why would the SEC privately take such an incendiary stance, and share it with one of its main targets, while publicly contradicting itself?\n\nPart of the confusion stems from the significance of a formal order, which, according to the SEC\u2019s enforcement manual, commission staff draft to be reviewed by the enforcement director and serves as the necessary first step to an investigation that empowers staff to subpoena witnesses and take evidence. As Lowenstein Sandler partner Christopher Gerold confirmed, formal orders are not \u201cconclusory,\u201d meaning they do not represent legal conclusions. That, instead, would come as part of a Wells Notice, which informs potential defendants of the end of an investigation.\n\nIn other words, just because the formal order seemed to indicate the SEC\u2019s view that ETH is a security at the beginning of an investigation does not make it the agency\u2019s official stance. That would also provide a more generous explanation as to why Gensler did not take a stance on ETH\u2019s status back in April 2023\u2014it was at the onset of the investigation, with the agency deciding whether it would diverge from the view of earlier commissions. And according to a person familiar with the issue, the Wells Notice received by Consensys this April included no language about ETH being a security.\n\nOf course, that could change if and when the SEC files its lawsuit against Consensys, which will focus on MetaMask\u2019s status as an unregistered broker-dealer, as well as its staking products. The complaint could very well name ETH to be one of the unregistered securities offered by MetaMask. And, as Duke Financial Economics Center lecturing fellow Lee Reiners told me, all indications point to the SEC naming ETH as an unregistered security as a rationale for rejecting Ether ETFs.\n\nStill, contrary to popular opinion amid the crypto industry, the agency has not yet taken the stance. \u201cIt\u2019s premature and inaccurate to claim that the SEC has decided anything at this point,\u201d Reiners said. But don\u2019t be surprised if we finally get an answer in the next few weeks.\n\nLeo Schwartz\n\nleo.schwartz@fortune.com\n\n@leomschwartz\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBinance founder and former CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao was sentenced to four months in federal prison on Tuesday for money laundering violations, despite prosecutors requesting 36 months.

        "content": "Who Holds The Most Ethereum (ETH)? How Coinbase, Grayscale, Robinhood And Binance Stack Up\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of blockchain is that everything is public. All transactions, wallets and portfolios are entirely accessible to anyone, allowing for an unprecedented amount of insight into a financial asset class.\n\nThe uses of the data can range from monitoring overall trading activity and flows to seeing what the largest wallets and firms are doing with their positions. Arkham Intelligence is a blockchain analytics platform particularly interested in the second application. It cross-references financial disclosures by firms and individuals with on-chain activity to match up entities with specific wallet addresses.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDogecoin millionaires are increasing \u2014 investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\nWith Arkham's insights, anyone can see how the largest entities in crypto are trading. One interesting application is looking at the largest firms in the space.\n\nCoinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the world, operates a centralized exchange, wallet service and a layer-2 called Base. Coinbase's portfolio is worth nearly $80 billion. The wallet is composed almost entirely of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). The firm holds over 900,000 BTC, currently worth over $55 billion. It also holds over 6.6 million ETH worth roughly $20 billion.\n\nWhile Coinbase operates as a crypto custodian, Grayscale is a crypto asset manager. It creates a handful of funds and ETFs that allow investors to access crypto products. In January, it was one of the first companies to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) converted from a previously released futures ETF. Grayscale's portfolio has more than 99% of its value in ETH and BTC. It owns 303,050 BTC worth $18.6 billion and 2.98 million ETH worth $9 billion. Grayscale holds $27.6 billion in crypto assets.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nWhile it is mostly known for its equity platform, Robinhood began offering crypto several years ago. The crypto platform offers a handful of the most popular tokens, but the portfolio is mostly invested in ETH, BTC and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The wallet has 140,000 BTC worth $8.6 billion, 1.5 million ETH worth $4.7 billion and 42.5 trillion SHIB worth $1 billion.\n\nAs the largest crypto exchange in the world, it is no surprise that Binance (BNB) has the largest portfolio, worth over $200 billion. It holds 165 million BNB worth $94 billion, 640,000 BTC worth $40 billion, $27.2 billion worth of Tether (USDT) and 4.4 million ETH worth $13.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase has the largest ETH holding on the list. Its $20 billion of ETH is more than 5% of the total supply. The four firms hold a combined 15.5 million ETH, which is roughly 12.7% of the supply.\n\nWhile this may make it seem like the supply of ETH is heavily concentrated among a few entities, Coinbase, Robinhood and Binance hold assets for their customers. The portion of the supply held by these firms is under the discretion of the millions of people who hold ETH on these brokerages.\n\nRead Next:\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Who Holds The Most Ethereum (ETH)?

        "title": "Ethereum has burnt $12.7bn since the London hard fork. But that may be slowing down - DLNews",
        "content": "It's been 1,000 days since Ethereum first started burning transaction fees.\n\nBut the mechanism, which offsets new tokens issued on the network, is slowing down.\n\nMore efficient transactions, an explosion of activity on layer 2 networks, and the recent Dencun upgrade have all helped reduce the amount of Ether the network burns.\n\nWith the implementation of an upgrade known as EIP-1559 as part of the London hard fork in August 2021, Ethereum became the first blockchain to start burning a portion of the fees users spend on transactions.\n\nThat was 1,000 days ago.\n\nThe move, the blockchain\u2019s faithful hoped, would help counterbalance the issuance of new Ether tokens on the network, creating a more sustainable monetary policy.\n\nAnd it worked. Over the following 1,000 days, Ethereum users have burnt some 4.3 million Ether, worth over $12.7 billion just by using the network.\n\nWhen Etherum slashed Ether emissions by switching to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in September 2022, the network became deflationary \u2014 meaning more Ether was, on average, burned by the network than new Ether was issued.\n\nBut in recent months the rate at which Ethereum is burning tokens is slowing.\n\nA combination of more efficient transactions, an explosion of activity on layer 2 networks, and the recent Dencun upgrade have all helped reduce transaction fees \u2014 and thus the amount of Ether the network burns.\n\nThe lower fees are great for users. But if Ethereum can\u2019t attract enough activity to offset the drop, it could easily lose its deflationary status, potentially throwing its economic model into question.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhy is the burn slowing?\n\nWhen Ethereum users transact on the network they must pay a fee denominated in Ether.\n\nThis fee is made up of two parts: a so-called base fee charged by the network, and a priority fee, paid to block builders as an incentive to get the transaction processed faster. Ethereum burns base fees, and gives priority fees to those processing transactions.\n\nWhen activity on Ethereum increases, the network automatically raises the base fee users must pay.\n\nThe average base fee on Ethereum must stay above 23 gwei these days to ensure the network burns enough Ether from transaction fees to keep it deflationary. Gwei is a measurement for small amounts of Ether.\n\nOver the past 1,000 days, gas fees have averaged 41 gwei. If this trend continues, Ethereum\u2019s supply is set to shrink by 0.76% over the coming year.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to believe it might not.\n\nEthereum\u2019s March 13 Dencun upgrade introduced a new feature that cut the fees Ethereum layer 2s needed to pay to submit transactions to the main Ethereum network by as much as 98%.\n\nSince Dencun, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees have fallen from an average of 58 gwei on March 13, to just 7 gwei on May 2.\n\nAdditionally, more users are making the jump from Ethereum to layer 2 networks \u2014 separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum that rely on it for security.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time high of over 11 million weekly transactions in 2021, transactions on Ethereum have slowly declined to around 8 million per week at the end of March.\n\nAt the same time, weekly transactions on Arbitrum and Optimism, the two biggest layer 2s, have soared to a combined 18.5 million.\n\nWith fewer users transacting on Ethereum, the demand for transactions \u2014 and thus fees paid on the network \u2014 is falling.\n\nIncreasing gas efficiency\n\nCode improvements that reduce the amount of data smart contracts on Ethereum need to handle, should also reduce fees in the coming months.\n\nFor example, decentralised exchange Uniswap, the most frequently used Ethereum DeFi protocol which users have spent over $1.4 billion in fees transacting on, has included several optimisations for its upcoming Uniswap v4 version.\n\nV4 is expected to improve gas efficiency between swaps and liquidity operations, as well as reduce the cost of creating new liquidity pools by 99%.\n\nFuture versions of other top Ethereum protocols will likely also optimise for transaction fees.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWill the SEC approve an Ethereum ETF this year?\n\nOptimism among market participants is fading\u2014and now that the SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum as a security has been made public, those hopes may have been shot down for good.\n\n\u201cIf this SEC approves a spot Ethereum ETF before the election, I will eat my HODL hat,\u201d Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at Van Eck, an Ethereum ETF applicant, told Decrypt.\n\nThat\u2019s because of a lawsuit filed last week by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC, which revealed that the Commission believes Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security\u2014and that the SEC has, for the last year, pursued investigations on that basis. Consensys wants a court to declare Ethereum as a non-security, preempting any forthcoming charges from the SEC. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo be clear, the SEC has yet to bring charges against Consensys, or anyone else, that formally allege Ethereum is a security. But the revelations in the Ethereum giant\u2019s lawsuit have already had far-reaching implications, with top Washington lawmakers accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of lying to Congress last year about the agency\u2019s position on ETH.\n\nWhile the long-term impact of SEC\u2019s investigations into Ethereum plays out, in the more immediate term this means spot Ethereum ETFs likely aren\u2019t happening\u2014at least, not without another legal fight.\n\nSpot market Ethereum ETFs would allow Wall Street firms and investors to gain indirect exposure to ETH without having to deal with crypto exchanges or wallets. After a decade of denials from the SEC, spot Bitcoin ETFs finally gained approval for trading in the U.S. market in January\u2014but only after Grayscale, one of the biggest digital asset managers in crypto, successfully sued the SEC to make it happen.\n\nStill, after Bitcoin ETFs got the green light, analysts assumed spot ETH ETFs were right behind, with approval likely by summer. Now analysts and ETF issuers on Wall Street aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum ETF applicants are expected to hear back from the SEC regarding approval by May 23. By last month, analysts were already cooling on the prospect that these initial filings would gain approval; this week\u2019s news has only further convinced experts that ETH ETF applications have a ways to go.\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, opined on Twitter this week that the SEC\u2019s now-evident position on ETH\u2019s security status likely means spot ETH ETFs aren\u2019t coming to Wall Street any time soon. And that\u2019s because ETFs based on commodities and securities operate on different rules, he said.\n\nYes dif rules, 33 act for commodities \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 29, 2024\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear, though, that the SEC\u2019s apparent hostility towards Ethereum has spooked would-be ETH ETF issuers\u2014at least not yet. A spokesperson for crypto fund manager 21Shares, the first-ever Ethereum ETF applicant in the U.S., told Decrypt that the firm remains committed to seeing its petition approved.\n\nVan Eck, a more traditional Wall Street investment firm, remains all-in as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s digital assets research chief Matthew Sigel believes the product will be approved \u201cin time.\u201d\n\nBut he emphasized that Van Eck\u2019s experience bringing crypto to Wall Street has never been without conflict. This week\u2019s news constituted just one additional bump in a road the firm always expected to be long and winding.\n\n\u201cThis has been war since January of 2022, it's been a war for the entire Biden tenure,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of our investment thesis for this asset class is that it will continue to win the bigger battles in the courts over time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Risk assets across the board got a boost from the Fed, with these three tokens seeing market-beating upside.\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector is getting a nice boost today from yesterday's commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The market received a jolt from Powell's commentary in a press release; he suggested the direction of the next Fed move will most likely be lower. The market had previously priced in some chance of an interest rate hike, which appears to be off the table, at least for now.\n\nWith a more accommodative monetary policy environment likely ahead, risk assets across the curve saw a big boost over the past 24 hours. Of course, the further out on the risk curve investors go, the more protracted this move can be. For top cryptos Bitcoin (BTC -3.28%), Ethereum (ETH -2.30%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -7.20%), it's meant a 24-hour move of 3.8%, 2.2%, and 4%, respectively, as of 4 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, there are some token-specific factors at play with these three tokens that investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's moving these closely watched digital assets.\n\nThe rally continues\n\nSince hitting a new all-time high right around the time of its most recent halving, Bitcoin's rally has faltered. Expectations for a potential continuation of this fall had taken hold because of economic factors that could affect the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut with interest rate hikes seemingly off the table, analysts have grown increasingly bullish on Bitcoin over the near and medium term. Lower interest rates should bring the U.S. dollar down, inflating the price of various commodities and goods that act as stores of value. For those who buy into this thesis for Bitcoin, that's a great thing. Indeed, yesterday's press conference likely had the greatest impact on Bitcoin for this very reason.\n\nEthereum's status as a commodity or store of value of sorts is also debatable. In second position in terms of market capitalization in this sector, Ethereum should benefit from a similar trend of capital flowing into cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin investors have benefited from. That's because the market is still expecting the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum ETFs at some point (though some suggest it's possible the SEC could still deem this asset a security), which should improve the supply and demand dynamics around this token. As Ethereum has shifted to a proof-of-stake protocol and taken on some deflationary measures for its token, there's a strong bull case building in the market that the same drivers that took Bitcoin on its run to record highs could be in play for Ethereum this year.\n\nDogecoin remains among the most speculative crypto assets out there, meaning it's a top choice for traders and investors looking to play short-term price swings in the market. It's no surprise that Dogecoin has seen a more pronounced move than its larger peers, for this reason alone. However, large liquidation data tied to a previous decline in these three tokens in recent days could also play a part in today's rally. Investors appear to have been looking for any reason to load up on risk and put capital to work on this dip. This recent macro catalyst appears to have provided the needed push.\n\nIs this rally poised to continue?\n\nToday's move needs to be put into context. Bitcoin declined to a low of around $58,000 per token yesterday, and while it's moving toward the $60,000 mark at the time of writing, that's still well off its all-time high of around $73,000 hit earlier this year. So, there's certainly both upside and downside potential in the near term, as this token did gap up quite quickly in short order.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin tend to follow Bitcoin's lead, so I'd say this is the token most investors should be focused on right now. I'm of the view that if a number of bullish catalysts materialize in the coming days, it's entirely possible Bitcoin could make another run at a new high, and Ethereum and Dogecoin could follow. It's just a question of whether this specific macro catalyst can be amplified by some additional news. Right now, there's not much on my radar, so I'm going to sit out this recent pop."

Discover SCENE\n\nIn the hours leading up to the next Federal Reserve meeting, investor pessimism has hit Bitcoin and Ethereum hard.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC has dropped 7.6% and ETH is down 6% over the past 24 hours. The Bitcoin price is hovering around $57,000, while the Ethereum price is stuck at just under $2,900, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe volatility has been hellish for derivatives traders. In the past 24 hours, $457 million worth of crypto futures positions have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass. And no big surprise, $392 million of those were long contracts.\n\nTraders opening futures contracts are essentially placing bets on future price action. To be long on an asset is to bet the price will go up. And to be short on it is to bet it'll go down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd it's not just blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have been impacted. Sagging prices have been widespread throughout the market. In fact, out of the whole top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinGecko, just a few assets have escaped the sea of red, barring stablecoins that have managed to maintain their pegs, such as Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee will publish its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.. Back in February, investors seemed certain that May would be the month that the FOMC finally cut interest rates\u2014which is usually a bullish sign for risk assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThat's because lowered interest rates usually coax traders out of U.S. Treasuries to chase gains in riskier assets, like equities and crypto assets.\n\nThe Fed's key interest rate currently stands at a high of 5.25% to 5.5% and has been unchanged since July 2023 as the central bank aims to curb inflation. Policymakers have been keeping a close eye on inflation, which is currently 3.5%, in hopes to get it closer to 2% before considering rate reductions. But that's becoming a distant hope, as last month inflation increased to the highest it's been since September.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTraders had a small jolt of hope in March, when the Swiss Central Bank announced it was cutting interest rates. \u201cFor some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability,\u201d the central bank wrote in its decision at the time. But it seems the sentiment in Switzerland hasn't spread to other major central banks.\n\nJust a month ago, traders seemed certain that the Fed might lower interest rates in June, according to the CME Fed Watch tool. But sentiment has soured. Traders don't expect to see the Fed ease interest rates until December\u2014and even then it's just a 75% majority that seem to feel that way."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Federal Reserve Wednesday elected to keep its key interest rate steady as the central bank\u2019s focus on fighting inflation compounded pain in the crypto market.\n\nIn his typically cautious tone, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% was difficult but added that he thought it was \u201cunlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said, but warned that it was \u201clikely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path to 2% inflation.\u201d\n\nHe would not reveal to reporters when there would be a rate cut.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d Powell added in a prepared statement.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen 4.6% and 1.3% over the past day to $57,600 and $2,945, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen slightly throughout the trading day.\n\nBut while the daily shift is broadly downward, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have marked slight increases over the past hour, including ahead of and since the rate announcement. Bitcoin is up 1% over the past hour, while Ethereum has perked up by 2% during the same span.\n\nSigns of stubborn inflation have lent traders pause, as fears boiled over last month that the Fed could be forced to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Those jitters were elevated recently by a stronger-than-expected rise in inflation and growth in wages in the first quarter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShifting rate expectations are driving Bitcoin\u2019s price more as spot Bitcoin ETFs see pittering inflows, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt Monday. For Ethereum, the pressure comes as a court battle over its regulatory status in the U.S. continues to come to light.\n\nInflation has fallen steadily from multi-decade highs in 2022, but it remains above the Fed\u2019s target of 2% annually. When inflation clocked in at 3.5% in the 12 months through March, a lack of change compared to the previous month\u2019s release caused crypto markets to shudder immediately.\n\nThe Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at a target range of between 5.25% and 5.5% since July of last year, pushing forward for months with the highest rates in more than 23 years.\n\nHigher interest rates, which can slow the economy through increased borrowing costs, are generally bad news for risk assets like stocks and crypto. That\u2019s because the payout on cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries becomes relatively more attractive as rates move and stay higher.\n\nThough the Fed in March had penciled in three quarter-percentage point cuts for 2024, traders have grown less hopeful. According to the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, financial market participants may see only one rate cute\u2014or zero\u2014by year\u2019s end.\n\nAs rate cut expectations inched further out in April, Bitcoin notched its worst month since November 2022. Coming off all-time highs in March, Bitcoin fell 14% throughout the month to around $60,000.\n\nIn April, Powell said that inflation hasn\u2019t come down as quickly as policymakers expected, suggesting rate cuts could still be far out. Yet the Fed chair signaled interest rates, where they currently are, could also be sufficient to get the job done too.\n\n\u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward with additional reporting by Mathew Di Salvo."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin is advising people to \"decentralize your own security,\" after weighing in on a Twitter discussion about using cold wallets.\n\nTo prove his point, Buterin said that he keeps 90% of his crypto funds in a mutisig Safe wallet.\n\n\"M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust,\" he wrote. \"Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other.\"\n\nThe \"m-of-n\" Buterin referred to describes one of the ways multisig, or multi-signature, wallets can be set up. The first variable refers to minimum number of signatures required to sign a contract, therefore spending or transferring funds from the wallet. The second variable refers to the total number of possible signatories that exist for the wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conversation started after a developer and research, who goes by the pseudonym 0xkofi on Twitter, urged crypto traders to think about how devastating it would be to lose all their funds and avoid it by investing in cold storage.\n\nThe above is why I use a multisig (@safe) for >90% of my personal funds \ud83d\ude42 M-of-N, some keys held by you (but not enough to block recovery), the rest held by other people you trust. Don't reveal who those other people are, even to each other. Decentralize your own security. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 1, 2024\n\n\"Your hardware wallet will be your fortress of solitude,\" Kofi wrote. \"It will allow you to sleep peacefully at night. It will protect you so that you can survive this game long enough to win.\"\n\nBut not everyone is sold on that being the right way to protect their personal crypto stash. Peter Watts, Uneven Labs CEO and the founder of Reservoir, a developer platform for launching NFT collections, highlighted the risks involved in relying on hardware wallets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"When using a hardware wallet, the biggest risk becomes yourself,\" he wrote, adding that someone might find a stashed private seed phrase, or a user could secure it so well that they can't retrieve it themselves.\n\nThat's when Buterin chimed in to describe how he makes sure that he isn't the single point of failure for the security of his cold storage wallet.\n\nPeople often think of @safe wallets as a team only solution. While this might have been true in early 2020, the user base has since evolved significantly. Today, individuals make up more than 99% of @safe users, including notable ones like @VitalikButerin and @punk6529 https://t.co/EyZuKpF2xa \u2014 Daniel (@danftz) May 1, 2024\n\nAlthough Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets have often been treated as a product to help DAOs and other groups manage shared treasuries, there's a lot of individuals who use them in a similar way to Buterin.\n\n\"Today, individuals make up more than 99% of Safe users, including notable ones like Vitalik Buterin and Punk6529,\" wrote a SafeDAO contributor and delegate known as Daniel on Twitter.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

This wallet contains millions worth of Ethereum.\n\nThis premined whale had spent almost nine years in dormancy \u2013 this means since 2015, the year that followed the end of the Ethereum initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nThe reactivated wallet contains almost 2,000 ETH worth $5,876,786.\n\n\ud83d\udca4 A dormant pre-mine address containing 1,969 #ETH (5,876,786 USD) has just been activated after 8.8 years!https://t.co/MzyVVkMhIc \u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 2, 2024\n\nEthereum Foundation dumps ICO ETH\n\nPrior to this awakening, an ancient wallet that belongs to the Ethereum Foundation was reactivated after nine years.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRedstone, a new Ethereum scaling network designed for fully on-chain games and \u201cautonomous worlds,\u201d launched its mainnet today\u2014with a number of early games already available for play.\n\nDeveloped by Ethereum startup Lattice, Redstone was built via Optimism\u2019s OP Stack scaling tech. But it\u2019s much more than a rebranded riff on the layer-2 tech that also powers networks like Base and Zora\u2014Redstone has been significantly retooled for the needs and demands of video games, particularly those that use blockchain for much more than asset ownership.\n\n\u201cWe've had core developers come along and make really cool contributions to the OP Stack,\u201d Optimism co-founder Ben Jones told Decrypt\u2019s GG. \u201cThis is the first [network] that\u2019s not just tweaking dials a little bit.\u201d\n\nMany crypto or \u201cWeb3\u201d games utilize technologies like NFTs for unique user-owned items or cryptocurrencies for decentralized economies. But fully on-chain or autonomous games also put their game logic or rules on-chain, working within the capabilities but also limitations of the decentralized technology to power playable games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\ud83d\udd34\ud83e\udea8Today, we\u2019re announcing Redstone, a super cost-effective L2 for onchain games, worlds, and other ambitious applications.@redstonexyz is a Plasma-inspired Alt-DA chain, built on the OP Stack.https://t.co/Rqnnhu5bmu \u2014 Lattice (@latticexyz) November 15, 2023\n\n\u201cMost of the time, when you fully embrace the medium or the system you're building to, you tend to get more interesting results\u2014and sometimes better harmonization\u2014just purely from a product development perspective,\u201d Lattice co-founder and CEO Justin Glibert told Decrypt\u2019s GG.\n\nGlibert says his team has embraced this model of building entirely on Ethereum, a \u201ccomputer that had to be multiplayer out of necessity, and not out of choice.\u201d Following early experimental games like Dark Forest, zkDungeon, and OPCraft that his team created or helped build on other chains, they\u2019ve designed Redstone to better suit such games\u2014and it\u2019s open to the public.\n\n\ud83c\udfc1\ud83d\udd34\ud83e\udea8 Coming soon to Redstone Mainnet: @DFArchon. DF Archon is building DF Ares, community-run rounds of the beloved onchain game Dark Forest. They bring new flavor and new plugins to the classic DF gameplay! Get ready for May 1st. https://t.co/9Dn5e51hRj pic.twitter.com/A0nuusqhjw \u2014 Redstone Chain (@redstonexyz) April 23, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCertainly, crypto games can be built on layer-1 networks, as well as general-purpose layer-2 scaling networks. But fully on-chain games can be held back by the way those networks are typically designed. Games need low latency speeds, for example\u2014and with such a constant flow of player inputs, they need to cut down on the friction of interacting with a blockchain.\n\nRedstone is built for just that, and it also features the first implementation of Plasma Mode, an alternative data availability protocol co-developed by Lattice and OP Labs. Plasma Mode allows for increased transaction throughput via an off-chain data availability provider, but also includes a permissionless Ethereum layer-1 feature that lets any user challenge suspicious inputs.\n\nIn short, Plasma Mode picks different kinds of design trade-offs to power games and other high-throughput decentralized apps, but also includes an on-chain capability to challenge potential threats. It\u2019s inspired by the Plasma concept that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin co-authored back in 2017 (and recently shined a fresh light on), and will be available throughout the OP Stack going forward.\n\nThat\u2019s paired with MUD, Lattice\u2019s engine for on-chain Ethereum games. It\u2019s being used by the studio\u2019s own Sky Strife, a tactical strategy game in the vein of Nintendo\u2019s classic Advance Wars that\u2019s available to play today. Other Redstone launch games also use MUD, plus EVE Online developer CCP Games is using the engine for its Project Awakening game\u2014though Glibert said that CCP has yet to choose a network for that project.\n\nAlong with Sky Strife, the initial lineup of Redstone games includes titles like Biomes, a Minecraft-like sandbox game; DF Ares, a community-driven revival of Dark Forest; and Downstream, which has been described both as an \u201cinfinitely moddable MMO\u201d and the \u201cworld's first post-singularity civilization simulator.\u201d\n\nA screenshot from Sky Strife. Image: Lattice\n\nOne of the more distinctive games on the launch list is DEAR, a game by ARPA that sounds like a cross between an abstract art project, a virtual pet simulator, and a crypto-fied social experiment. Or as an ARPA representative described it, \u201cDEAR is a digital creature that transforms under the collective behavior of all players\u2014a tug of war between two factions, whether you feed or abuse the creature.\u201d\n\n\u201cExperimental\u201d is a fair term to describe most of what\u2019s happening around Redstone and fully on-chain games. Some of the early games look far from mass-market in aesthetic and are built around new and unfamiliar concepts.\n\nThere are various benefits to being fully on-chain, Glibert said, such as the ability to easily deploy modifications to games and create new business models around existing games. Fully on-chain games (FOCGs) can\u2019t be shut down or erased from existence like some Web2 games, while autonomous worlds (AWs) could yield new kinds of play mechanics and experiences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis onchain game introduces an interplay of LOVE and HATE, with a PVP twist.

DEAR exhibits purposeful behaviour and mimics essential human interactions,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gRw2c5ucHc \u2014 ggQuest (@gg_quest_gg) April 24, 2024\n\nWhether there\u2019s a business here, however, remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cMost of the studios out there that have raised capital to build on-chain games\u2014nobody knows if it's actually going to be a valuable market,\u201d said Glibert. \u201cI would say most of the people that are doing this seriously, they also don't know if there's actually a mature-enough business model today to do it.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019re still building, attempting to push the edges of what\u2019s possible on-chain.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of noise of \u2018how to monetize\u2019 before a FOCG actually takes shape,\u201d ARPA co-founder and CTO Majorknight told Decrypt\u2019s GG. \u201cRushed monetization is the killer of innovation. At best, it creates one-hit-wonders like the play-to-earn games we have seen and doesn't have anything to do with making FOCGs, or improving the infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world's first Post Singularity Civilisation Simulator\u201d???

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap in the last 24 hours, underwent a significant price drop of approximately 7.8%. This sharp decline has raised alarms among investors, particularly against the backdrop of widespread turbulence in the Ethereum market. The sudden downturn has prompted a thorough investigation into the factors driving this decline.\n\nEthereum Price Plunge Amid Whale Activity\n\nOf particular significance is the occurrence of a significant whale 0x035 offloading event involving 1,767 ETH, valued at approximately $5.4 million, which was transferred to the leading exchange Upbit. This substantial movement of Ethereum tokens by a single entity has further fueled bearish sentiments within the market, exacerbating uncertainties surrounding Ethereum\u2019s future price trajectory.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMoreover, data from on-chain trackers has shed light on the substantial whale activity surrounding Ethereum, particularly within the past few hours leading up to the price plunge. The transfer of 1,767 ETH to Upbit a centralized exchanges (CEX) shows the scale of whale involvement in Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics. Notably, Whale Alert\u2019s data confirms the magnitude of this transaction, emphasizing the significant value transferred to Upbit.\n\nThese recent developments, marked by Ethereum selloffs and heightened whale activity, have intensified concerns among investors regarding Ethereum\u2019s short-term outlook. The phenomenon of whales capitalizing on profit opportunities amid the absence of a post-halving rally has further contributed to the prevailing sentiment of caution within the Ethereum community. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification as a security have added an additional layer of apprehension, amplifying the overall market volatility and reinforcing the need for vigilance among market participants.\n\nAlso Read: Possible Outcomes of FOMC Meeting, How Would Bitcoin And Crypto Market React?\n\nEthereum Market Analysis and Insights\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Ethereum\u2019s recent price decline and heightened market volatility, a comprehensive analysis of its current market dynamics offers valuable insights into its ongoing performance and future prospects. At present, Ethereum\u2019s price stands at $2,904, reflecting a significant 7.8% decrease over the past 24 hours, indicative of the mixed sentiments prevailing within the market.\n\nFurther examination of derivatives data reveals an 8.30% decrease in ETH\u2019s open interest and it is currently valued at $7.6 Billion. This decline in open interest highlights the evolving nature of Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics and the potential impact on investor sentiment and trading activity.\n\nDespite these challenges, TRON founder Justin Sun\u2019s accumulation of significant amounts of ETH signals confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future potential and may serve as a catalyst for renewed investor interest in the token.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s median gas fee has reached its lowest point in three years, standing at 6.43 gwei as of April 27. This notable decline in gas prices offers potential relief for users, particularly amidst ongoing concerns regarding high transaction fees on the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF Outflows Jump to $161 Million Ahead of FOMC\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

The recent fall backed by increasing volume hints at the sellers\u2019 conviction to lead the asset value lower as BTC goes Sub-60K.

If the bulls can manage to haul BTC back above the $59,200 level, it could solidify the recovery, effectively meaning that BTC has bottomed out at $56,552.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin price remains in the woods amid falling momentum and growing bearish sentiment, as shown by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) momentum indicators.\n\nIf the Bull Market Support band fails to hold as support, Bitcoin price could extend the fall toward the $52,000 threshold, or in a dire case, test the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, with the RSI holding well above the mean level of 50, and the AO still in positive territory, all hope is not lost for BTC bulls. And while a flip of $59,200 into support would solidify a recovery rally, the bearish thesis will only be invalidated once BTC breaks and closes above $72,000.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price reclaims $59K as Fed leaves rates unchanged\n\nEthereum price still flirts with 25% upside potential\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern. This bullish pattern will be executed after a decisive breakout above the upper trendline in the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe target objective for this pattern is a 25% move toward $4,250, determined by measuring the height of the wedge and superimposing it at the expected breakout point. The descending wedge pattern remains viable, given that the Ethereum price continues to hold above $2,900 in the 12-hour timeframe.\n\nETH/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, with the lower highs of the RSI, the bears could have their way, sending Ethereum price below the $2,900 buyer congestion level. Such a move would not only negate the bullish reversal pattern but also encourage more sell orders.\n\nTraders looking to open long positions for ETH should wait for the RSI to reclaim above 50 mean level, a move that could be accompanied by a bounce of Ethereum price above the lower boundary of the pattern. A 12-hour candlestick close above $3,212 would provide a good entry.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum attempts recovery from dip amid unchanged interest rates and accusations leveled at SEC Chair\n\nRipple price defends against further downside\n\nRipple price could pivot around $0.4952, marked by the 50% Fibonacci placeholder, as XRP bulls show commitment to defend the $0.5000 threshold. The RSI has managed to record higher lows in the one-day timeframe, which points to growing bullish momentum.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see the XRP price bounce with the prospect of reclaiming the $0.5715 peak of the range. In a highly bullish case, the gains could be seen in the rippling price foray above $0.6000, which is almost 17% above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if the 50% Fibonacci placeholder fails to hold as a support, the Ripple price could drop. A candlestick close below $0.4782 would produce a lower low, hinting at a possible trend reversal.\n\nSpooked holders would then pull the trigger, sending Ripple price below the $0.4500, or in a dire case, roll over to $0.4188. This would mean a fall of nearly 20% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP sustains above $0.50 as traders digest news of Ripple XRP Ledger entry in the Japanese market."

        "title": "Ethereum: Exchange inflows spikes - FXStreet",
        "content": "During significant pullbacks in cryptocurrencies, there is often a fear of further weakness in specific coins, leading to increased transactions from private wallets to exchanges. This trend is particularly evident when inflows to exchanges spike, a sign that pessimism may be reaching late stages in the current market cycle. For example, with Ethereum, we're seeing exactly this pattern: as the price declines, exchange flows have notably increased on the spot market, indicating that traders are concerned about potential further drops.\n\nThis scenario, however, could signal a potential turning point. Market sentiment often shifts from pessimism to optimism and vice versa, and when sentiment reaches an extreme, it's wise to be on the lookout for a possible reversal. Currently, it seems Ethereum might stabilize in the coming days or perhaps into next week.\n\nHowever, it's interesting to note the contrast with Bitcoin. Exchange inflows for Bitcoin haven't reached the same extremes, suggesting that investors may have more confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term stability compared to altcoins. This disparity could indicate that investors believe the altcoin season might be over, preferring to hold Bitcoin for the longer term.\n\nGet Full Access To Our Premium Elliott Wave Analysis For 14 Days.

        "content": "Despite the ongoing price dip, Ethereum sees record wallet growth with 267K new addresses on April 28 and 29, the highest since October 2022.\n\nEthereum has witnessed a significant spike in new wallets hosted on the network, marking a notable resurgence in interest amidst a general market downturn.\n\nAccording to data shared by Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, nearly 267,000 new Ethereum wallets were set up on April 28 and 29. This is the largest two-day increase observed since early October 2022, suggesting a robust expansion of the Ethereum network. This growth occurs in contrast to Ethereum\u2019s recent price dip.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Ethereum saw a milestone as April came to an end. 266.6K new wallets were created on April 28th and 29th, the highest 2-day stretch of network growth since October 8th and 9th, 2022. It is a strong that $ETH continues expanding despite dipping prices. https://t.co/SN6xqc3JXV pic.twitter.com/KDcjhY30y5 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 1, 2024\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite the economic uncertainties and fluctuating market conditions, Ethereum continues to attract a diverse array of users. This surge in new wallets could potentially be linked to ongoing developments, such as improvements in scalability and security through its continued upgrades.\n\nAnother analysis by CoinMarketCap reveals an uneven spread of Ethereum across different addresses. The vast majority of Ethereum addresses, approximately 97.49%, hold between $0 and $1,000 worth of the cryptocurrency.\n\nOnly a small fraction, 2.40%, hold between $1,000 and $100,000, with the remaining 0.10% of addresses holding over $100,000 in Ethereum. This data indicates that while a few hold large amounts of Ethereum, most users possess relatively small balances.\n\nWhale Movements and Influence\n\nDespite their limited numbers, Ethereum whales control a substantial portion of the total holdings. According to data from Clank, a whale tracking platform, whales hold about 40.75% of Ethereum\u2019s total circulating supply. These large holders play a role in Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics, capable of influencing price movements significantly.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nClank\u2019s data further shows that the average holdings of these whales amount to 9,839,698 ETH, valued at $3.66 million. This sizable influence is also evident in the \u201cWhale of the Day\u201d transaction within Binance, where an internal transfer of over $45 million worth of Ethereum occurred.\n\nHolding Patterns Among Ethereum Investors\n\nThe holding time for Ethereum varies significantly among different addresses. According to the latest data, a large majority, 74.43%, are long-term holders, which reflects a strong confidence in the potential future value of Ethereum.\n\nMedium-term holders, or \u201cCruisers,\u201d make up 21.31%, while only a small percentage, 4.26%, are classified as \u201cTraders\u201d who hold their positions for shorter durations.\n\nDespite a price decline of 3.80% over the last week, Ethereum is still performing relatively well compared to the broader cryptocurrency market, which saw an average decline of 8.80%. As of today, the price of ETH stands at $2,992, with a total market capitalization of $355.6 billion."

        "content": "Ethereum saw two sizeable waves of profit-taking in the past month that projected doubts about an upcoming rally.\n\nThe ETH whales have added to their stash, with retail being keen to sell.\n\nEthereum [ETH] saw a rejection from the $3360 resistance level over the weekend. This outlined short-term bearish sentiment.\n\nIn other news, the latest Dencun upgrade was a success, helping L2 solutions reach low gas fees.\n\nThe next target for the developers is called Prague. Even though hopeful news was breaking, on-chain metrics showed a lack of faith from market participants.\n\nThe clues from the Ethereum supply distribution\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the supply distribution showed that almost every wallet holding anywhere from 1 to 100k ETH has been selling in recent months.\n\nThe micro wallets with under 0.1 Ethereum were the ones buying, hopeful of a rally after Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] halving.\n\nIn the past, when the 100k-1 million token holder cohort was added to their stash, it came during a market rally. Sometimes it preceded a major retracement, like it did in mid-January.\n\nThe second half of April saw this cohort quiet down, neither adding to nor selling their supply.\n\nThe 1 million- 10 million cohort saw a sharp uptick in early March. Since then, they too have been quiet. Together, it showed that the large participants expected bullish sentiment in the coming months.\n\nA sharp spike in the 100k- 1 million holders\u2019 supply could be useful for traders to mark local tops and imminent retracements.\n\nDoes fear still rule the market?\n\nThe network realized profit/loss (NRPL) grows during periods of swift price appreciation as profits pile up. The first two weeks of March saw strong price rallies alongside NRPL spikes.\n\nThis indicated profit-taking activity.\n\nHowever, the NRPL has trended downward since then. It saw occasional spikes, such as in late March and mid-April, each smaller than the last.\n\nThis showed participants were keen on booking profits even though the price was just above the $3k support zone.\n\nIt indicated a lack of faith, which is part of the extended retracement Ethereum has witnessed in the past two months.\n\nOn the other hand, the mean dollar invested age (MDIA) has trended strongly higher in the past month. This metric shows that the asset is in an accumulation phase once again.\n\nIt fell sharply during the rally to indicate holders were realizing profits en masse.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIn the past month, the HOLDer sentiment has been stronger than the collective urge to book profits.\n\nIn conclusion, the metrics showed both fear and hope were present in the market, but long-term investors have more reason to hold on than to sell."

        "content": "Analysts predict peak cycle for Bitcoin and Ethereum amid regulatory uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory debates and SEC allegations intensify negative sentiment toward Ethereum.\n\nAs Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency, dips below the $60,000 threshold, analysts suggest that BTC may have reached its peak for this cycle.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seems to be mirroring the movements of Bitcoin, as both cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing a downward trend.\n\nCommenting on the uniqueness of this crypto cycle, crypto veteran Alex Kr\u00fcger said,\n\n\u201cThe crypto cycle has been almost entirely driven by the bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cETH has been a major disappointment, but it has performed well overall for stakers and airdrop farmers.\u201d\n\nWhy is Ethereum losing its limelight?\n\nUndoubtedly, Bitcoin achieved remarkable performance by reaching new record highs in this cycle. However, Ethereum\u2019s position has declined, falling below Solana in terms of product-market fit and retail trader popularity.\n\nThis raises a question: Can Ethereum\u2019s price plummet to $2500 within the next 7 days?\n\nWell, to answer this, AMBcrytpo analyzed the liquidation levels for ETH.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the Ethereum market has a cluster of liquidation levels between $2640 and $2750, attracting traders due to high liquidity. Additionally, this price range aligns with a bullish order block observed at the range highs, further reinforcing its significance.\n\nThis underlines that Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to decline to this liquidity pocket before a potential reversal.\n\nThe concerns surround ETH\u2019s classification as a security\n\nMoreover, the ongoing debate surrounding whether ETH is a security has intensified negative investor sentiment toward Ethereum.\n\nAmidst these metrics, a new development also took place wherein Rep. Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee noted,\n\n\u201cNew court filings indicate that @SECGov Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of #ETH at a @FinancialCmte hearing to conduct oversight of his agency.\u201d\n\nThis highlights the increasing uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status and its impact on investor sentiment.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, @TheDustyBC, a content creator, took to X (Formerly Twitter) and said,\n\n\u201cEthereum not being kind on the feelings today.\u201d\n\nWay forward\n\nHowever, now with the hawkish stance at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on the 1st of May. And, the Hong Kong ETFs being a major disappointment, the execs are still waiting for the tables to turn. Needless to say, Kr\u00fcger claims,"

Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 45.31, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 40.50.\n\nAt these values, the indicators signaled a preference for coin distribution over accumulation.\n\nFurther, the coin\u2019s MACD line (blue) rested below its signal line (orange) and approached the zero line at press time.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s MACD line rests below its signal line, it indicates a rise in bearish momentum.

The downtrend was persistent in April and the selling volume was growing.\n\nThe indicators were bearish on the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe disappointment from the Hong Kong ETFs\u2019 volume on the first day outlined the sentiment toward ETH and crypto.

If the daily session closes below this level, the price would very likely head toward the next support zone at $2600.\n\nThis region also has confluence with the former range highs that ETH traded within a few months ago. The RSI on the 1-day timeframe has been below neutral 50 for most of April, highlighting consistent downward momentum.\n\nThe OBV also slipped below a support level recently and retested it as resistance. Ethereum is likely to register sizeable losses before reaching the next notable level on the indicator.\n\nThe hunt for liquidity could see ETH go south\n\nThe closest cluster of liquidation levels for ETH was downward. The $2640-$2750 region presented an attractive pocket of liquidity.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt also has confluence with the bullish order block highlighted at the range highs.\n\nIt is expected that ETH will descend to this liquidity pocket before a reversal.

About 266.6k new wallets were created on the 28th of April and 29th, the biggest 2-day stretch of network expansion since October 2022.\n\nNetwork expansion is one of the primary measures for determining if a cryptocurrency is gaining or losing traction. The onboarding of new users indicated confidence in ETH\u2019s long-term potential, ignoring short-term blips.\n\nRetail users enter ETH market\n\nOn further scrutiny, it came to light that retail users were jumping on the bandwagon. The addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 units of ETH increased significantly while the prices plunged, as per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nInterestingly, the cohorts holding more than 1 ETH were selling off, as evident in the drop in their ETH reserves.\n\nThe aforementioned findings suggested that retail interest was strong for ETH and healthy inflows from this segment could contribute to a relief rally in the days ahead.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

Bitcoin dropped to $56,494 \u2013 A level last seen on 28 February 2024. Market sentiment skewed towards the side of fear as investors rebalanced their portfolios in expectation of no rate cuts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s MVRV Ratio (7-D) fell to -8.099%, at press time. On average, Bitcoin holders were underwater. It suggested that the market value was significantly lower than the price at which most acquired BTC.\n\nIt could also be taken as a sign of undervaluation. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s market report for the month of April, Bitcoin will continue its downward journey for the majority of trading sessions in May.\n\nHowever, the report discusses three factors (Related to BTCFi, Options ETF, and Solana) that could reverse the king coin\u2019s trajectory. Investments through BTC ETFs will have a bigger impact on price, compared to the fed rate cut anticipation or geopolitical strains.\n\nSince 24 April, BTC ETF outflows have been outweighing the inflows. On 30 April, a $161 million outflow was registered \u2013 The highest in the last three days.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s report throws light on a fresh perspective though \u2013 It reveals numerous institutions are seeking approval for Bitcoin ETFs. If these ETFs are green-lit in May, it could lead to a significant hike in demand, potentially driving the price north.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s savior \u2013 Runes\n\nThe rise of DeFi on the Bitcoin blockchain could save traders from registering massive losses in the coming months (AMBCrypto\u2019s report dives into its full details).\n\nInterestingly, the 7-day moving average of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap to transaction fee ratio fell below that of Ethereum. It highlighted a huge surge in activity on the Bitcoin network since the launch of the Runes protocol. Basically, this ratio indicates how much money is flowing into a cryptocurrency relative to the transaction fees being paid.\n\nAltcoins\u2019 performance in April\n\nFollowing Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps, the price of other cryptocurrencies also fluctuated by a significant degree. April was a volatile month for most altcoins. The broader market witnessed a downturn due to geopolitical tensions and inflation fears. However, some sectors thrived, like gaming tokens.\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s report, Ethereum\u2019s dominance has been challenged by Solana, whose DeFi market share has been surging steadily. Meanwhile, an Ethereum ETF is still pending SEC approval, and staking on the Ethereum blockchain is on the rise, raising concerns about its future as \u201cmoney.\u201d\n\nTake a look at AMBCrypto\u2019s Market Analysis \u2013 April 2024 Edition\n\nDive into April\u2019s market trends, valuable data, and exclusive insights to help yourself navigate through May\u2019s market movements.\n\nThe report delves deep into key topics like \u2013\n\nRising popularity of DeFi on Bitcoin\n\nAmerica\u2019s love for memecoins\n\nFall in USDT\u2019s dominance\n\nSolana\u2019s TVL masterstroke\n\nNFT market\u2019s recovery\n\nMarket forecast for May\n\nYou can also download the full report here."

With 10+ years of writing experience, I am a Crypto Journalist by chance, exploring, and learning all the dynamics of the sci-fi action-filled crypto world. Currently, focusing on cryptocurrency news and price data. With a passion for research and challenging my capabilities, I am slowly getting into the crypto arena to bring new insights every day.\n\nAnalyst Davinci, in his latest video, discussed the potential impact of Bitcoin roll-ups on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, suggesting a remarkable tenfold increase. While historically associated with Ethereum, rollups may soon revolutionize Bitcoin\u2019s transaction capacity and functionality, according to a team of crypto developers.\n\nThe analyst observed that Bitcoin is struggling to break free from its current situation on the charts. Despite attempting to rally again, he anticipated this might be its last push before a potential breakdown. He noted it could mark a critical moment if Bitcoin drops back to or below $60,000.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a chance of a bounce from that level, he suggested considering a short position. Assessing the risk-reward ratio, he highlighted the potential for a downward move, possibly reaching down to the red line. This presented an opportunity for a profitable short trade on Bitcoin, which he recommended considering if it was missed earlier.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\nLooking at Ethereum\u2019s chart, it keeps trying to go up but keeps getting stopped by a price level that used to be its support. It\u2019s acting as tough resistance, making it hard for Ethereum to climb higher. If Ethereum drops below $3200, it could be in big trouble, possibly falling even more.\n\nAnalyzing where Ethereum might go next, it looks like $2500 could be a significant target for its price to drop. This means Ethereum might have a rough patch ahead. However, Ethereum and Bitcoin are expected to do well in the long run, regardless of challenges from regulators like the SEC and governments.\n\n\u201cYou cannot stop a technology whose time has come,\u201d he declared confidently, assuring his audience of brighter days ahead in the world of crypto.\n\nAlso Check Out : Here\u2019s When Bitcoin (BTC) Price Will Initiate a Fresh Rally"
