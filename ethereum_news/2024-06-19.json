        "title": "SEC closes investigation into Ethereum 2.0, no securities charges against ETH: Consensys - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "SEC's decision marks a turning point for Ethereum, likely confirming its commodity status.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has wrapped up its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 and will no longer pursue legal action claiming that ETH sales are securities transactions, according to a recent announcement from Consensys.\n\nConsensys said this is a major win for Ethereum developers and businesses. It removes a cloud of uncertainty that could have hampered Ethereum\u2019s growth.\n\nIn March, an update on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub repository revealed that the organization was under investigation by an unnamed \u201cstate authority.\u201d After the discovery, Fortune reported that the SEC pursued an \u201cenergetic legal campaign\u201d to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nUncertainty intensified after Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC in April. Part of the company\u2019s effort was seeking a court ruling that would declare that Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is not a security.\n\nFOX Business reported in late April that the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, headed by Gurbir Grewal, initiated a formal investigation into Ethereum\u2019s status as a security in March 2023. The investigation, known as \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201c, explores transactions and activities associated with Ethereum dating back to 2018.\n\nAs noted, the SEC\u2019s latest decision comes after Consensys sent a letter to the SEC arguing that the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs implies ETH is not a security, and the SEC should close the investigation. The move likely hinged on considering ETH a commodity, much like BTC, and signifies no forthcoming legal challenges.\n\nDespite this progress, Consensys said the quest for definitive regulatory guidelines continues, especially concerning services like MetaMask Swaps and Staking. The team is still seeking broader clarity from the SEC on crypto regulations.\n\nOur fight continues. In our lawsuit, we also seek a declaration that offering the user interface software MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate the securities laws. It should not take a lawsuit to provide the much-needed regulatory clarity to allow an industry that serves\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024"

        "content": "Ethereum fans can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its investigation into the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nEthereum development studio Consensys shared the news on X overnight.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0,\u201d the company posted.\n\n\u201cThis means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIndications of an SEC probe into Ethereum and entities supporting the protocol circulated in March, when Fortune reported the agency was investigating three unnamed related companies for potential securities violations.\n\nConsensys then sued the SEC one month later, alleging regulatory overreach. The suit claimed chairman Gary Gensler sought to grab power over the crypto space, using legal maneuvers that would force ETH into a security definition following its switch to proof of stake in September 2022.\n\nPart of those filings disclosed that Consensys had received a Wells notice from the SEC, indicating the agency\u2019s intent to sue. The Fort Worth firm, which owns popular web3 infrastructure including crypto wallet MetaMask and API provider Infura, was founded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin.\n\nWhile the SEC probe was expected to be dropped following approval of a suite of spot ether ETFs last month, the formal notice puts to bed one of crypto\u2019s primary existential threats, at least for now.\n\nFormer SEC chair Jay Clayton had initially backed SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman\u2019s notion that ether was no longer a security in 2019, as there was no central entity in control of the cryptocurrency at the time. No official statement had been given by the agency, however, and Gensler had seemingly been walking back those thoughts ever since.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Alexander Grieve, government affairs lead at venture capital firm Paradigm, tweeted a copy of the SEC\u2019s letter to Consensys. It reads:\n\n\u201cWe write to provide notice that we have concluded the investigation in the [matter of Ethereum 2.0]\u2026. based on the information we have as of this date, we do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against your client, Consensys Software Inc. with respect to this investigation.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe letter added that the notice was given under guidelines in the Securities Act which state that it \u201cmust in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nAll good news for Consensys but other legal threats still loom over crypto. So far, there\u2019s no word of the SEC\u2019s Uniswap probe being dropped, although a lawsuit has not yet been filed.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Let's break down when you can expect them to hit the market and who's behind the scenes making it happen.\n\nEthereum ETF Launch \u2013 When\u2019s the Big Day?\n\nInvestors and traders are clutching their Ethereum wallets in anticipation of the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF guru, Eric Balchunas, has circled July 2nd on the calendar. This date could be a game-changer, opening up a fresh route for folks to dive into Ethereum.\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s in the Game?\n\nThe road to getting these ETFs approved has been a wild ride. The SEC has given the green light to the 19b-4 forms for eight big players, including heavyweights like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. This stamp of approval is a big deal, letting these companies move forward with their ETF plans.\n\nThe SEC has also tossed some light comments on the S-1 filings back to the issuers. This is a good sign that things are moving in the right direction. SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinted during a budget chat on June 13th that we might see these ETFs get the nod by September. Back on May 23rd, the SEC gave a thumbs-up to the 19b-4 filings from eight companies for Ethereum ETFs. This is a solid signal that these ETFs are just around the corner. Investors and traders are watching like hawks, knowing that the launch of Ethereum ETFs could shake up the crypto market in a big way.\n\nMarket Projections\n\nGetting a grip on the market projections for the Ethereum ETF can be a game-changer for crypto traders and investors. Let\u2019s break down VanEck\u2019s price forecast and the expected institutional money flow.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Price Projection\n\nVanEck, a big player in asset management, has thrown out a bold prediction for Ethereum (ETH). They reckon Ethereum could hit $22,000 by 2030. This guess is based on Ethereum pulling in around $66 billion in \u201cfree cashflows.\u201d\n\nInstitutional Capital Inflows\n\nThe launch of spot Ethereum ETFs is set to draw in a hefty amount of institutional cash. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered thinks the inflows could be anywhere from $15 billion to $45 billion in the first year alone.\n\nThese numbers show just how much Ethereum ETFs could shake up the market. If you\u2019re into crypto trading or investing, this is something you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nImpact on ETH Prices\n\nPrice Rally Prediction\n\nEveryone\u2019s buzzing about the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, and it\u2019s got the crypto world in a tizzy. QCP Capital, a trading firm out of Singapore, thinks this could send ETH prices soaring. They\u2019re talking a 60% jump, similar to what happened when spot Bitcoin ETFs got the green light back in January.\n\nMarket Reaction and Price Fluctuations\n\nThe market\u2019s been all over the place since the news dropped on June 13th. ETH took a nosedive from $3,558 to $3,464, hitting its lowest point for the month. But it didn\u2019t stay down for long, bouncing back up by 0.69% to $3,517.\n\nEven with these ups and downs, the market isn\u2019t exactly screaming \u201cbullish.\u201d It looks like ETH might still be stuck in a bit of a rut, influenced by some bearish vibes. Check out the recent price movements.\n\nFor traders and investors, keeping tabs on these shifts is key. Knowing how the market\u2019s reacting can help you make smarter moves with your investments.\n\nApproval Process Updates\n\nSEC Chair\u2019s Statements\n\nDuring a budget hearing on June 13th, SEC Chair Gary Gensler mentioned that the approval process for Ethereum ETFs is expected to wrap up by summer, with a likely nod by September. The timeline hinges on how quickly issuers respond to the SEC\u2019s feedback. This has stirred up quite the buzz in the crypto world.\n\nPrice Impact and Market Sentiment\n\nEven with worries about the drawn-out approval process for Ethereum ETFs, Gensler\u2019s recent comments hint at a September green light, giving issuers more prep time. After the June 13th announcement about the potential approval, ETH\u2019s price saw some ups and downs.\n\nETH\u2019s price dipped from $3,558 to $3,464, hitting its lowest in June. But as of the latest update, ETH has bounced back a bit, up 0.69% to $3,517. Despite these price swings, the indicators didn\u2019t show a strong bullish vibe, suggesting ETH might still be swayed by bearish trends. This mixed market sentiment highlights the cautious optimism about the potential Ethereum ETF approval."

        "content": "Consensys: SEC Closes Investigation Into Ethereum\n\nLeading Ethereum developer Consensys revealed late Tuesday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to close its investigation into Ethereum 2.0. This announcement marks a pivotal moment for Ethereum developers and the broader crypto industry.\n\nThe decision follows the SEC's approval of Ethereum spot ETFs last month. Consensys had responded to this approval by sending a letter to the SEC, pointing out that the funds were based on ETH being classified as a commodity. The letter sought clarification on how this classification would impact the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaura Brookover, an attorney for Consensys, took to Twitter to share the SEC's notification letter along with the company's full statement. \"Things have changed remarkably fast since we filed our lawsuit against the SEC in late April, culminating in today\u2019s development,\" Brookover wrote. \"After more than a year, the Ethereum investigation is finally over with no charges against anyone.\"\n\nDespite the positive news, the SEC's correspondence included a standard disclaimer, noting that the conclusion of the investigation should not be interpreted as an exoneration or a guarantee that no future action would be taken.\n\nWhile the closing of the Ethereum investigation is a significant victory, Consensys remains critical of the SEC's overall approach to crypto regulation. \"The closing of the Ethereum investigation is momentous, but it\u2019s not a cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under the SEC\u2019s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime.\""

        "title": "Ethereum gets huge win as SEC closes investigation into securities sale allegations - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The SEC has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, determining that sales of ETH are not securities transactions. The decision comes after a letter from Consensys on June 7, seeking clarity following the May approvals of ETH ETFs, which were based on ETH being classified as a commodity. Consensys stated,\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0. This means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nEthereum rose over 4% overnight following the news, pulling the rest of the crypto market with it as many projects positive over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is the notable exception, down 0.74% according to CryptoSlate data as of press time.\n\nConsensys announced this development as a significant victory for Ethereum developers and the broader industry. The closure of the investigation signifies a pivotal moment for the Ethereum community, providing a reprieve from potential regulatory actions that could have categorized ETH as a security. The SEC\u2019s decision aligns with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) stance, which has consistently classified ETH as a commodity.\n\nDespite this positive outcome, Consensys continues its legal battle against the SEC to secure further regulatory clarity. The company argues that the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions against blockchain developers and technology providers have been overly aggressive and unlawful. Consensys\u2019s lawsuit also seeks a declaration that offering user interface software like MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate securities laws.\n\nAs Consensys emphasized, the legal fight is not just about Ethereum but about safeguarding the future of blockchain innovation in the United States. The SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum had posed a risk to adopting and developing blockchain technologies, with potential negative implications for US leadership in this sector. By challenging the SEC\u2019s authority, Consensys aims to prevent what it describes as an unlawful power grab that could hinder technological advancements and economic opportunities.\n\nThe resolution of the Ethereum investigation marks a critical juncture, but Consensys insists that the broader regulatory environment still requires significant reform. The company\u2019s lawsuit highlights the need for clear guidelines that support innovation while ensuring compliance with existing laws. As the blockchain industry evolves, resolving these regulatory issues will be crucial in determining the pace and direction of technological progress.\n\nAccording to Consensys, fighting for regulatory clarity is essential to ensuring blockchain technology continues growing and contributing to the economy. The company\u2019s actions reflect a broader concern within the crypto community about the need for balanced regulation that fosters innovation without stifling growth.\n\nIndustry participants and regulators alike will closely watch the outcome of Consensys\u2019s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. The case highlights the tensions between regulatory oversight and technological innovation, a dynamic that will shape the future of blockchain technology and its applications.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The head of digital assets research at VanEck, Matthew Sigel, is outlining how Ethereum (ETH) could reach a price of $154,000, which the asset manager set as the bull case target in a report released weeks ago.\n\nIn a new interview on Bankless, Sigel says that Ethereum could reach a six-figure price by increasing its market share.\n\n\u201cIn that case, ETH would be capturing 90% of all smart contract value intermediation\u2026 so the penetration rates get pretty chunky, so Ethereum essentially accounts for 15% of the total financial markets. And then 50% of the advertising market hosted on open-source blockchains. And between 20% to 25% of information technology (IT) infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI) going through open source blockchain.\u201d\n\nAccording to VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, the state of the global macro economy would also influence Ethereum\u2019s prospects of reaching a six-figure price.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019d say in that world probably emerging markets are doing very well and the US dollar is doing extremely poorly. And the US regulatory state has either like fully embraced open-source digital assets, which I think is unlikely, or you completely seeded them to other countries. And then in that bull case, Ethereum is capturing a pretty sizable percentage of the value.\u201d\n\nIn the report released earlier this month, VanEck set a base case target for Ethereum of $22,000, a potential gain of 518% from the current level. To hit the bull case target, Ethereum would have to appreciate by 4,225% from the current price.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,560 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Hoskinson, whose own project, Cardano, has previously faced SEC inquiries regarding its ADA token, reposted the news and gave his silent co-signature.\n\nCautiously optimistic\n\nThe timing of Consensys' news, amid reduced trading volumes due to closed U.S. markets, suggests an attempt to boost market sentiment. Despite speculation about the inevitability of the SEC's decision following the ETF approvals, Consensys' affirmation provided a noticeable boost to the altcoin markets in recent hours.\n\nNevertheless, market observers are awaiting the reopening of U.S. exchanges on Thursday to gauge the full impact on broader market dynamics.\n\nWhile the SEC's move is seen as positive for Ethereum, uncertainties remain around the pending MetaMask staking process, suggesting continued regulatory challenges.\n\nIn sum, Ethereum's clearing of regulatory hurdles, supported by industry figures such as Hoskinson, could be crucial in shaping future developments in blockchain technology and investor confidence."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf the SEC is no longer investigating Ethereum, does that mean other similar cryptocurrencies are off the hook?\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday informed Ethereum software company Consensys that it has dropped its investigation into \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d referring to the blockchain network\u2019s transition to proof of stake nearly two years ago.\n\nThis combined with the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs for trading in the U.S. has been widely perceived as an admission by the Commission that Ethereum is not a security, which in turn could mean that other proof-of-stake coins like Solana and Polygon are also not securities. But legal experts who spoke with Decrypt have warned against thinking in such black and white terms.\n\n\u201cI expect that the letter has little to no impact on the legal classification of other [proof-of-stake] coins,\u201d Drew Hinkes, an attorney who specializes in digital assets, told Decrypt. \u201cThose other tokens were presumably not investigated in the investigation of Ethereum 2.0 and their facts as to creation, distribution, etc. are likely different from those of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsensys sued the SEC earlier this year in a preemptive move after receiving a Wells Notice, which typically indicates the regulator intends to bring an enforcement action. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) In its lawsuit, Consensys revealed the SEC has been operating under the assumption that Ethereum is an unregistered security for at least a year, partially because of the network\u2019s switch to proof of stake.\n\nProof of stake refers to a system in which cryptocurrency network users pledge their assets\u2014in this case ETH\u2014in order to participate in validating transactions and securing the network. Users who stake are then rewarded in ETH for their trouble, with yields ranging from 1% to 4% APY, depending on the staking platform.\n\nEthereum, which once operated much more like the energy-intensive Bitcoin blockchain, completed its transition to proof of stake in September 2022 after a years-long process. At the time, questions immediately arose as to whether staking could implicate federal securities laws in the United States. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he believed staking could run afoul of the law because \u201cthe investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe SEC has now apparently changed its view. But even if the Commission is no longer investigating Ethereum, it could proceed differently with other tokens, says Hinkes, according to the manner in which those specific assets were initially sold. The SEC may also consider factors like the state of the technology, the mechanics of its block validation, and more, according to the attorney.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMatt Corva, a lawyer for Consensys, seemingly concurs, posting yesterday on Twitter: \u201cWe don't know [if Polygon, Solana, or other coins are securities] because the SEC has evaded showing their homework on precisely why they've now concluded that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe don't know the specifics of import for other coins.\u201d\n\nNot all companies can spend millions of dollars and thousands of hours dealing with an unlawful investigation - and they shouldn't need to. We know Bitcoin is not a security and we know Ethereum is not a security. What about Polygon, or Solana, or any other coin? \u2014 Matt Corva (@MattCorva) June 19, 2024\n\nOther legal experts are similarly befuddled by the SEC\u2019s opaqueness.\n\n\u201cThe SEC was very careful in the language it used in its letter,\u201d crypto criminal defense lawyer Carlo D'Angelo told Decrypt. \u201cWithout a more specific statement from the SEC, or a definitive ruling from a court, it remains unclear how the agency views ETH and other [proof of stake networks].\u201d\n\nWhile the end of the Ethereum investigation might not be a carte blanche for proof-of-stake coins, one expert believes it\u2019s a good building block.\n\nSebastian Heine, head of risk and compliance at institutional staking company Northstake, claims it does \u201cstrengthen\u201d some cases, but every coin is \u201ctoo individual\u201d to make sweeping statements. \u201cThe SEC is still very crypto negative so there shouldn\u2019t be any high expectations from the SEC acting favorably towards other proof-of-stake coins,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Coinbase Lists Pre-Launch Ethereum Restaking Protocol at $12.2 Billion Valuation\n\nIn a recent development, Coinbase has listed the Ethereum (ETH) restaking protocol project, EigenLayer (EIGEN), for pre-launch trading. Coinbase\u2019s announcement on X confirmed that EIGEN is now open for trading ahead of its official launch on Coinbase\u2019s International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. This is specifically for users in eligible jurisdictions outside of the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nThe exchange explained, \u201cYou can now trade EIGEN-PERP with up to 2x leverage. EIGEN opens with a price of $7.307 and an Implied FDV of $12.2 B.\u201d EigenLayer enables ETH holders to re-stake their tokens for use as \u201ccryptoeconomic security\u201d for protocols other than Ethereum, in return for protocol fees and rewards. An example: if you staked $100 of ETH for 10 years at a rate of 5%, you would have $127. However, if you restaked the original ETH just one time for a total of $100 staked across 2 protocols for 10 years at a rate of 5%, you would have $154.\n\nThe pre-launch trading feature on Coinbase is a novel addition. It permits users to trade perpetual futures contracts on tokens that are yet to be launched. Once the underlying token is launched on relevant spot exchanges, the instrument transitions to a standard perpetual contract. Its accepted collateral/margins were listed as USDC, BTC, and ETH with a minimum order size of 10 USDC.\n\nHowever, Coinbase has also issued a warning to users about the increased risks associated with trading pre-launch digital assets. The exchange emphasized the need for users to fully understand the risks involved before trading contracts.\n\nThe listing of EigenLayer\u2019s restaking protocol on Coinbase for pre-launch trading marks a significant step in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market. This move not only provides traders with an opportunity to engage in futures contracts on tokens that are yet to be launched, but it also reflects the growing acceptance and integration of Ethereum-based protocols in the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of pre-launch trading on Coinbase could potentially pave the way for other exchanges to follow suit, thereby expanding the range of trading options available to cryptocurrency investors. However, it\u2019s crucial for traders to heed Coinbase\u2019s warning and fully understand the risks associated with pre-launch trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Coinbase Lists Pre-Launch Ethereum Restaking Protocol at $12.2 Billion Valuation originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The saga of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) pursuit of Ethereum continues to unfold, with a recent development offering a glimmer of hope for the future of the world's second-largest blockchain.\n\nLet's rewind a bit. Back in April, Consensys, a prominent Ethereum development firm, shocked the crypto world by suing the SEC. This lawsuit stemmed from a Wells Notice \u2013 a precursor to enforcement action \u2013 received by Consensys, hinting at the SEC's potential classification of Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, as a security.\n\nThis move by the SEC was met with widespread criticism. Many saw it as an overreach of regulatory authority, with the potential to stifle innovation in the burgeoning DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space. Consensys argued that Ethereum is a decentralized network, and ETH functions more like a commodity than a security.\n\nFast forward to June, and a surprising twist has emerged. News broke on Wednesday that Consensys announced the closure of the SEC's investigation into Ethereum 2.0 (the upcoming upgrade to the Ethereum network). While Consensys clarified that the fight isn't entirely over, this development is a significant victory for the Ethereum community.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\n\"The closing of the Ethereum investigation is momentous, but it\u2019s not a cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under SEC\u2019s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime,\" Consensys said in a tweet.\n\nThe news provided a boost for cryptocurrencies across the board, with Ethereum climbing from its Tuesday low of around $3,380 to sit at $3,527 at time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\n\nThe closure of the SEC's investigation is a positive sign for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency space. It suggests that the SEC may be re-evaluating its stance on how to classify decentralized blockchain networks and their native tokens. This could pave the way for a more collaborative approach between regulators and the crypto industry.\n\nThe recent developments hold potential implications for the long-awaited approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. These ETFs would track the price of ETH directly, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without needing to hold the underlying asset themselves.\n\nThe SEC's previous stance on Ethereum created uncertainty for these ETF proposals. However, with the closure of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation, the path to approval for Spot Ethereum ETFs might be clearer. Regulatory clarity from the SEC is still needed, but this positive development increases the chances of seeing these ETFs come to fruition in the US sooner rather than later.\n\nWhile the recent news is encouraging, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US remains murky. The closure of the investigation specifically focused on Ethereum 2.0, leaving the status of ETH under the SEC's radar.\n\nConsensys, for instance, has emphasized that they are still seeking broader clarity from the SEC on how regulations apply to features like MetaMask Swaps and Staking.\n\nBitwise Revises ETF Filing\n\nIn a further sign of optimism for the Ethereum ecosystem, Bitwise Asset Management recently revised its filing for its spot Ethereum ETF, ETHW. This revision notably includes a potential $100 million investment from crypto investment firm Pantera Capital. The initial seed capital investment by Bitwise amounted to $2.5 million, facilitating the purchase of ETH prior to the listing.\n\nOther spot Ethereum ETF S-1 amendments are expected in the coming days. Two sources told The Block that there is a Friday deadline for prospective ETF issuers to respond to SEC comments regarding their S-1 forms. The sources described the comments as \u201clight\u201d and \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\nElsewhere\n\nBlockhead Wants You!\n\nAre you a university undergraduate who's as passionate about crypto as you are about writing?

        "content": "Asset manager Bitwise, whose spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB) stands as the fifth largest in terms of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) assets under management, is making significant moves in the cryptocurrency ETF space, particularly with its Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETF. Recently, the firm revealed that it received $2.5 million in seed investment interest for this fund, with Pantera Capital expressing interest in acquiring up to $100 million in shares. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this interest isn\u2019t binding, which means potential buyers might choose not to purchase any shares.\n\nRecently, the SEC approved 19b-4 forms for eight Ethereum ETFs, pushing the approval process forward. This comes after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stated last week that he expects approvals could come this summer and mentioned that issuers are smoothly working through the process. Analysts are hopeful these ETFs could get the green light before July 4.\n\nIs ETH Going to Boom?\n\nIt seems like today\u2019s positive news has caused Ethereum\u2019s price to rise almost 5% at the time of writing. Nevertheless, when using TipRanks\u2019 technical analysis tool, the indicators seem to point to a neutral outlook. Indeed, the summary section pictured below shows that nine indicators are Bullish, compared to four Neutral and nine Bearish indicators.\n\nStill, Ethereum has greatly outperformed both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Bitcoin since 2019, according to data from TipRanks. In fact, $10,000 invested in Ethereum would be worth over $242K today compared to over $95K for Bitcoin and almost $24K for SPY, as per the image below. Although past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future results, the fact that ETH is smaller than Bitcoin does provide it with the potential to continue outperforming."

        "title": "Ethereum: The Cryptocurrency Star Worth Watching - TipRanks",
        "content": "Ethereum is the cryptocurrency star worth watching. If you\u2019ve ever watched a heist movie where the protagonist pulls off an incredible feat against all odds, then you\u2019ll understand the thrill surrounding Ethereum (ETH-USD) in the financial world. Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has grown from an ambitious project to a pivotal player in the cryptocurrency space, capturing the attention of investors and tech enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Magic Behind Ethereum\n\nEthereum isn\u2019t just another cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps). These smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, operating without downtime, censorship, or fraud. This revolutionary technology shifts the paradigm from traditional contracts requiring intermediaries to automated, trustless transactions.\n\nThe core of Ethereum\u2019s operations is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which runs these smart contracts. This unique capability differentiates Ethereum from other digital currencies, making it more than just a cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat Drives Ethereum\u2019s Price?\n\nSeveral factors influence Ethereum\u2019s price. Market sentiment plays a significant role, driven by news, social media, and overall attitudes toward the crypto market. For instance, when large financial institutions show support for Ethereum or there\u2019s growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms built on Ethereum, prices often surge. Conversely, fears of regulatory crackdowns can cause significant drops.\n\nGlobal economic trends also impact Ethereum. During times of high inflation, investors might turn to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum as a hedge against currency devaluation. Moreover, changes in monetary policy, such as interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like Ethereum.\n\nTechnological advancements are another crucial factor. The ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, which promises to reduce transaction fees and increase transaction speed and energy efficiency, has the potential to drive prices higher. However, delays or issues in these upgrades can lead to negative market reactions.\n\nA Volatile History\n\nEthereum has experienced significant volatility since its launch. The first major price surge occurred in 2017, peaking at around $1,400 in early 2018. Another significant growth period was from 2020 to 2021, driven by its growing adoption and the booming DeFi sector, pushing prices above $4,000.\n\nShould You Invest in Ethereum?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum is about more than just buying a cryptocurrency; it\u2019s about betting on a platform with wide-ranging applications. Ethereum\u2019s technological edge, particularly its smart contract functionality, has the potential to reshape industries from finance to art. Its influence is evident, with many top cryptocurrencies based on or linked to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to compare Ethereum with other investment options. While Ethereum offers high growth potential, it also comes with higher volatility and risks, particularly regulatory and technological challenges.\n\nThe Future Looks Bright\n\nExperts are generally optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s long-term potential, although they acknowledge the volatility driven by regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market adoption. Ethereum 2.0 aims to bring scalability, security, and sustainability improvements, which could significantly impact its performance and adoption.\n\nAccording to recent analysis, Ethereum could become a powerhouse among digital assets, with a predicted token price of $11.8k by 2030. Its combination of a globally distributed infrastructure, smart contract capabilities, and a digital commerce model enables trustless transactions, making it a strong contender for capturing economic value.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is priced at $3,531.92, reflecting a 50.60% increase year-to-date.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum stands out in the cryptocurrency world due to its technological innovation, market influence, and application versatility. As it continues to evolve, Ethereum\u2019s adaptability and resilience will likely keep it at the forefront of the digital revolution. However, potential investors should approach with caution, recognizing the inherent volatility and risks associated with the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "After adjusting for this year's rally in crypto prices, TON, Aptos, and Sui have grown faster than other blockchains in terms of TVL since January.\n\nArbitrum and Optimism, meanwhile, have seen outflows despite a jump in active addresses.\n\nA trio of blockchains born in the post-Terra \u201ccrypto winter\u201d have been the fastest risers of 2024.\n\nAfter adjusting for this year\u2019s rally in crypto prices, The Open Network associated with messaging app Telegram, or TON, along with Aptos and Sui, a pair of blockchains based on the Facebook-built Move programming language, have grown faster than rivals.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Coinbase analyst David Han, who compared the boom to competitors including Solana, Ethereum, and major Ethereum rollups.\n\nAdjusting for price \u201chelps to isolate how much TVL growth arises from net new value creation instead of pure price appreciation,\u201d Han wrote in a mid-year review on the industry.\n\nTotal value locked is a metric that tracks the value of crypto deposited in blockchains\u2019 myriad DeFi applications.\n\nTON launched in December 2022. Aptos and Sui went live in October 2022 and May 2023, respectively.\n\nBase was the lone Ethereum-based rollup to outperform aggregate TVL growth, said Han. Crypto deposited in Arbitrum and Optimism, two of the longest-running rollups, has declined since the start of the year.\n\nNevertheless, these blockchains have benefitted from Ethereum\u2019s March upgrade, dubbed Dencun. That upgrade made it far cheaper to use rollups.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEven as the dollar value of crypto deposited in rollups hits all-time highs, total transaction fees they have collected has plummeted since the upgrade, according to Han.\n\nMoreover, rollup users \u201chave grown tremendously \u2026 as fees have dropped post [Dencun],\u201d Han notes \u2014 particularly on Arbitrum.\n\nTON\u2019s growth\n\nTON\u2019s massive rally this year coincides with the deployment of Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin on the blockchain in April.\n\nThe TON blockchain has a crypto wallet integrated into the Telegram messaging app, allowing users to send USDT to their contacts worldwide directly from the app.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only incentive the TON team introduced to promote USDT adoption on the network.\n\nUsers who store USDT on their Telegram mobile wallets can earn up to 50% annualised yields \u2015 much higher than the average DeFi interest rate offered by lending protocols.\n\nThe yield comes from TON token rewards for providing liquidity on major decentralised exchanges on the blockchain.\n\nBut the network hasn\u2019t been able to attract established DeFi projects to deploy their protocols on the chain.\n\nAleks Gilbert is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum, the leading smart-contract Layer-1 blockchain, has witnessed a sharp decrease in its open interest, which has dropped to $11.5 billion. It has dropped by $1.5 billion in the span of two weeks, according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\nOpen interest in Ethereum peaked on June 5, and since then, $400M of liquidations have taken place, with long liquidations standing at $285 million.\n\nPrior to June 5, the previous all-time high in Ethereum\u2019s open interest stood at $9.5 billion in 2021, when ETH\u2019s price touched its all-time high of approximately $4,800.\n\nOpen interest is the total number of open derivative contracts that have not yet been settled.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA decrease in open interest thus bodes well for Ethereum, as market sentiment points to there being less chance of wild price swings in either direction caused by excess leverage. When those swings happen, it leads to liquidations in either direction.\n\nETH is currently trading at $3,616, an increase of 2% in the past 24 hours. The asset clocked a moderate gain of 3.1% in the past 7 days, according to CoinGecko.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent uptick can be attributed to short liquidations, as $19.33 million was liquidated in the past 24 hours, while long liquidations stood at $11.11 million, according to derivatives analytics platform Coinglass.\n\nOn Tuesday, leading Ethereum developer Consensys announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 without filing any charges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d the company tweeted.\n\nThis development comes as a positive surprise for market participants, as previously a report indicated that the SEC had internally deemed the asset to be a security.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously said that U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are likely to launch sometime during summer, however, he refused to provide clarity on whether the SEC considered the asset a security or a commodity.\n\nInstitutions have already started to express their interest in Ethereum ETFs.\n\nPantera Capital Management LP plans on investing $100 million when trading in U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs begins, according to Bitwise Asset Management. If Pantera Capital follows through with the purchase, it will not be able to sell the purchased shares in the open market for a period of six months.\n\nEarlier this month, global asset manager VanEck dubbed Ethereum \u201cdigital oil\u201d and forecasted that the leading smart-contract cryptocurrency will reach $22,000 by 2030.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to close its investigation into Ethereum, according to a recent announcement by Consensys, the developer behind the MetaMask wallet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company revealed that it sent a letter to the SEC in early June seeking confirmation that the May approval of a spot Ethereum ETF signaled the end of the regulatory case against the major altcoin.\n\nThe development has sparked mixed reactions on the crypto market. While Ethereum's apparent regulatory clearance led to a rebound in crypto prices after a prolonged decline, the XRP community has reacted with frustration and skepticism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum gets SEC nod, XRP fans see red\n\nAs one may recall, there has been a long-standing \"feud\" between XRP and ETH, centering on allegations that Ethereum received preferential treatment from the SEC, to the detriment of XRP and other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as \"ETHGate.\"\n\nBill Morgan, a prominent XRP enthusiast and attorney, expressed his dissatisfaction with the SEC's preferential treatment of the main altcoin. He noted that the recent decision marks Ethereum's second \"free pass\" from the SEC, highlighting what he sees as arbitrary and inconsistent regulatory practices.\n\nEthereum\u2019s second free pass from the SEC almost exactly 6 years after the Hinman free speech.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s and Ripple\u2019s different treatment will forever show how arbitrary the SEC has been in crypto. https://t.co/Coxf6czO9r pic.twitter.com/WNcacVYhNE \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 19, 2024\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Hinman speech, in which former SEC Director William Hinman stated that Ethereum was not a security, is a key point of contention. Morgan believes that this speech set a precedent that unfairly benefited ETH, while leaving Ripple, the company associated with XRP, open to legal challenges.\n\nOther XRP supporters echoed these sentiments, with some calling for legal action against the SEC and alleging that the Ethereum community used financial influence to secure favorable regulatory outcomes."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe second wave of the crypto ETF marketing blitz has officially begun, with crypto index fund manager Bitwise releasing a \u201cnational TV ad\u201d on Thursday talking up the Ethereum network.\n\n\u201cUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4pm,\u201d the company wrote in a tweet on Thursday with an accompanying video.\n\nUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 40-second commercial featured an old man role-playing as the traditional stock market that\u2019s only \u201cawake\u201d from 9:30am to 4pm, contrasted with a young man representing Ethereum\u2014a blockchain that never goes offline.\n\n\u201cStablecoins, NFTs, loans... people can access me 24/7,\u201d the young man tells his elder. \u201cYou\u2019ll get after it again on Monday.\u201d\n\nFollowing the post, Bitwise revealed that it had minted the video as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Half of the ad\u2019s proceeds will go directly to the commercial\u2019s two actors.\n\nThe simple, short pitch mirrors that of the array of Bitcoin ETF commercials that hit the airwaves late last year. Promoters like Galaxy Digital said Bitcoin \u201cembodies empowerment in the digital age,\u201d while HashDex pitched it as the next \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d in financial technology after the credit card.\n\nBitwise was also the first of many issuers to run a Bitcoin ETF ad at the time, recruiting help from Johnathan Goldsmith\u2014the most interesting man in the world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat influx of ads preceded the Bitcoin spot ETF rollout that occurred roughly a month later, attracting billions of dollars in investments. As of today, expert analysts believe Ethereum ETFs are weeks away from going live, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas forecasting a simultaneous launch on July 2.\n\nGrayscale ran a TV commercial about Ethereum in March in support of its existing $10 billion Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which it intends to convert into an Ethereum ETF. However, Bitwise's ad is the first to go out for a proper Ethereum ETF after regulators officially approved them for public trading in late May.\n\nWhile no other Ethereum ads have emerged yet, future ETF providers have been talking up the asset\u2019s investment thesis. Much like Bitwise, VanEck in early June pitched Ethereum as a new and improved set of global financial rails, forecasting that ETH would hit $22,000 by 2030.\n\nLikewise, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan posted a thread on Thursday arguing why investors may want to diversify into Ethereum alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cAdding ETH to a portfolio over a full crypto market cycle has historically boosted both your absolute and risk-adjusted returns compared to adding BTC only,\u201d said Hougan.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs may not cause upward surge in ETH price as many expect - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum ETF issuers are expected to file updated S-1s before weekend following Bitwise filings.\n\nSEC didn't explicitly declare ETH a commodity despite closing Ethereum 2.0 investigation.\n\nEthereum's increased implied volatility may be misleading as institutions may employ similar cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy when spot ETH ETFs launch.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price increased over 4% in the past 24 hours after the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its Ethereum 2.0 investigations amid expectations of spot ETH ETFs. However, the recent excitement surrounding ETH ETFs may not lead to the expected price increase.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Bitwise files updated ETH ETF S-1, SEC drops Ethereum 2.0 investigation\n\nBitwise filed an updated S-1 draft for its spot ETH ETF with the SEC after the agency commented on issuers' initial S-1 filings last week. The filing disclosed that asset manager Pantera Capital will purchase $100 million of the ETF shares when it launches.\n\nAlso read: Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETF\n\nBloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had earlier shifted his over/under date prediction for when ETH ETFs will launch to July 2 after saying he heard that the SEC's first round of comments on the S-1s were \"light\" and \"nothing major.\" He also mentioned that the agency expects issuers to return these drafts before the end of the week with a decent chance of working to declare them effective next week.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum infrastructure provider Consensys announced that the SEC's enforcement division is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, meaning that the agency \"will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\"\n\nConsensys disclosed that the decision comes after it sent a letter to the SEC on June 7 asking whether the approval of spot ETH ETFs on May 23 indicates the agency would end its Ethereum 2.0 investigation.\n\nRead more: Ethereum survives SEC scrutiny: Enforcement division closes investigation into Ether, Consensys says\n\nHowever, the SEC's letter to Consensys didn't confirm whether it was concluding that ETH is a commodity. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also failed to give a direct answer when questioned if ETH is a commodity in a Senate hearing last week.\n\nFortune earlier reported that the SEC began investigating the Ethereum Foundation and several Ethereum-related firms based on ETH's potential security status.\n\nETH technical analysis: Could Ethereum's price fail to rise following ETF launch?\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,557, up more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Total ETH liquidations in the past 24 hours are at $34.37 million with $22.34 million in short liquidations exceeding those of longs.\n\nETH implied volatility (IV) rose to 65% in the front end after its price rebounded following the latest developments discussed above, according to QCP Capital analysts. Implied volatility measures how much the market expects the future price of an asset or options contract to change over a certain period.\n\n\"Despite uncertainty surrounding the reception of ETH ETFs, capturing 10-20% of BTC ETF flows will propel them above $4,000, nearing its peak of $4,800,\" noted the analysts.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum resumes downtrend as Canada sees another staked ETH ETF launch\n\nHowever, Amberdata's director of derivatives, Greg Magadini, believes the current excitement surrounding spot ETH ETFs and its expected impact on the price of ETH may be unfounded.\n\n\"I continue to remain skeptical that this relative volatility premium remains persistent. A lot of cold water was splashed on the BTC ETF inflows narrative, given the speculation that funds are merely trading the BTC basis as opposed to taking outright ETF exposure,\" wrote Magadini.\n\nThe statement follows a stalemate in Bitcoin's price despite record ETF inflows after reports that hedge funds are employing a cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy on the top digital asset. Typically, hedge funds gain spot exposure to Bitcoin through spot BTC ETFs and then short its equivalent futures contract, profiting from its higher futures premium and funding rate fees.\n\nMagadini expects institutions to employ a similar strategy with ETH ETFs when they go live, potentially triggering a sideways price movement for the number one altcoin.\n\nHe also pointed to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) Ethereum open interest (OI) compared to Bitcoin.\n\n\"The true resolution to this question [about persistent of [E]ther vol premium] comes when we see the actual ETF inflows and volume. If this looks anything like the CME OI between BTC futures and ETH futures, I think ETH still doesn't have the mainstream enthusiasm that BTC has seen,\" noted Magadini.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAs of the time of writing, Ethereum CME OI is at $1.32 billion, while Bitcoin's figure is $10.14 billion.\n\nA breakout above the $3,900 resistance could see ETH beat this cycle's current high of $4,000 and rally to a new all-time high above the $4,878 price level. However, a breach below the $3,300 support may send ETH crashing to lows around the $2,852 level."

        "content": "Stuart Alderoty, Ripple's top legal mind, still has some questions left after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission unexpectedly dropped its investigation into Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Alderoty described the SEC's decision as a \"big win\" for Ethereum studio Consensys, he is still not sure whether it means that the company's offers and sales of the Ether token are not securities. Moreover, the legal status of Ether itself largely remains in a grey area.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to clarify whether or not the Ether token can be considered to be an unregistered security. Alderoty is now wondering what Gensler's response to such a question would be now that the agency has abruptly ended its probe into Consensys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, the Ethereum backer filed a lawsuit against the agency after a Wells notice of impending enforcement action. Consensys accused the SEC of recklessly hurting market participants and developers by attempting to label Ether as a security. The studio also defended its popular MetaMask wallet, denying the SEC's claims that it had violated securities laws by acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.\n\nIn a sudden reversal, the SEC ended up not recommending an enforcement action, sending the price of the Ether token higher earlier this week.\n\nHowever, the status of Metamask and staking remains unclear, according to Alderoty."

        "title": "The SEC has changed its mind: it now considers Ethereum a commodity - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "It seems that the SEC has changed its mind about Ethereum, and now considers it a commodity.\n\nThat he had changed his mind about Ethereum was already clear from the moment he approved the requests for the issuance of spot ETH ETFs in May, but now another confirmation has arrived.\n\nThe renunciation of the SEC: Ethereum is a commodity\n\nIn fact, last night Consensys announced on its official X profile that it has received a notification that the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nThis, according to Consensys, would mean that the SEC will no longer accuse those who allow the buying and selling of ETH of allowing the exchange of unregistered securities.\n\nAfter the transition to Proof-of-Stake, in September 2022, the SEC had started to believe that ETH could be considered a security, given that the introduction of PoS also generates the possibility of earning simply by staking one\u2019s tokens.\n\nHowever, it is not the SEC that decides what should be considered a security, and what instead a commodity, and last year a court explicitly ruled on the XRP case stating that when this cryptocurrency is traded on secondary markets (the exchanges) it cannot be considered an investment contract, and therefore not even a security.\n\nAt that point, many began to think that if a court were ever forced to rule on Ethereum (ETH), it would have supported more or less the same thing, but the SEC did not want to hear about it anyway.\n\nThe role of ETF approval\n\nFor these reasons, it was expected that the SEC would reject the requests to issue an ETF on spot ETH in May, as it considered ETH an unregistered security and therefore not tradable on regulated markets.\n\nAnd instead, unexpectedly, ended up approving these requests.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the past it had also rejected requests for the issuance of spot Bitcoin ETFs, despite BTC always being considered a commodity.\n\nIt always took a court ruling, issued last year, to effectively force the SEC to approve them.\n\nInstead in May, evidently, he had already changed his mind.\n\nThe hypothesis circulating is that, being in the electoral campaign for the November presidential elections, the current Biden administration did not want to go looking for trouble with the crypto community, precisely at a time when his challenger Trump seems to be able to become a political reference point in the USA for this community.\n\nSo the SEC, probably reluctantly, in May approved the requests for spot ETH ETFs, after the resounding success in traditional markets of spot BTC ETFs in the first part of the year, and now it has effectively found itself unable to sustain the hypothesis that ETH should be considered an unregistered security.\n\nThe volte-face of the SEC: the agency changes its mind on Ethereum (ETH), it is a commodity\n\nThe point is that, if the SEC really considered ETH an unregistered security, it would not have been able to approve spot ETFs collateralized in ETH.\n\nSo it was already clear from May that the SEC had changed its mind about Ethereum, from this point of view, even if probably reluctantly and in a not at all convinced way.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC is in all respects a government agency, whose heads and members can be replaced by the government. Therefore, ultimately it is the American government that decides its policy, and not the internal bodies.\n\nAt this point, it was also inevitable that the SEC would decide not to proceed with the case against Ethereum, deemed an unregistered security, because it would have effectively meant self-accusing of having violated the law by authorizing an ETF on an asset considered non-tradable according to market regulations.\n\nThe result is that not only has the SEC approved spot ETH ETFs on US exchanges, but it has also inevitably had to stop accusing Ethereum of being an unregistered security.\n\nAt this point in the USA, it can be stated that ETH should be considered a commodity, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe company Consensys\n\nConsensys received this notification because on June 7th they sent a letter to the SEC asking the agency to confirm that the approvals of the spot ETH ETFs in May were based on the fact that ETH was considered a commodity. In response, the agency was forced to admit that it had closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe company, however, also states that its fight continues, because it is now also requesting an official statement regarding the fact that the offer of the MetaMask Swaps and Staking user interface software does not violate security laws.\n\nConsensys in fact is the company that developed the well-known crypto wallet MetaMask, within which exchange functionalities have also been integrated for some time now.\n\nMetaMask is probably the most used wallet for Ethereum in the world, and Consensys is the leading company in this field, excluding non-profit organizations like the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe founder of Consensys is Joseph Lubin, who in turn was also one of the secondary co-founders of Ethereum. He is a true giant in this sector, and this is why he insists so much even at high levels to prevent the authorities from stopping Ethereum.\n\nOne of the things he did was to sue the SEC itself, in an attempt to prevent the agency from imposing its will beyond its rightful role.\n\nAs of now, it can be stated that this battle of Consensys against the SEC is concluding with a victory for the crypto company, and a defeat for the government agency, even though theoretically it is not yet a completely concluded battle. At this moment, however, a final reversal of the situation seems rather difficult."

        "content": "The SEC has backed down on its Ethereum investigation.\n\nThe community slammed the Howey test.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly \u2018closing\u2019 the investigation into Ethereum [ETH] 2.0 and ConsenSys, the firm behind Meta Mask wallet.\n\nReacting to the update, ConsenSys stated it has \u2018survived SEC\u2019 and marked a win for ETH developers.\n\n\u2018Ethereum survives the SEC. Today we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\u2019\n\nEthereum 2.0 refers to the post-Merge era, when the network changed from PoW (proof of work) to PoS (Proof of Stake). Clarifying the impact of the update on ETH sold post-Merge, the firm added,\n\n\u201cThis means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions.\u201d\n\nSEC \u2013 Ethereum tussle, and community reactions\n\nIn April, Consensys sued the SEC for an \u201cunlawful power grab,\u201d accusing the SEC of going after it and its developers and classifying ETH as \u2018security.\u2019\n\nHowever, much has changed since the lawsuit, with an easing of the war on crypto and partial approval of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nSo, the SEC\u2019s decision to back down from the investigation wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. Part of SEC\u2019s statement on the move read,\n\n\u201cWe do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the Commission against your client, Consensys Software Inc., with respect to this investigation.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Alexander Grieve, Government Affairs officer at Paradigm, suggested that the SEC\u2019s letter was \u201cunusual\u201c and \u201cpretty evasive\u201d regarding notification.\n\nHowever, the update brought up the Howey test debate again. The SEC typically uses the test to determine whether an investment product is a security.\n\nReacting to the SEC-Ethereum update, Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, commented,\n\n\u201cGood. It was a silly theory of liability, to begin with\u2026How do you explain both this decision and the other projects maligned by the SEC\u2019s broken Howey analysis?\u201d\n\nAnother analyst and tech investor, Fred Krueger, called the Howey test \u201ca joke\u201c and suggested the decision was political.\n\nETH price action\n\nApparently, the update seems to have turned a previous headwind into a tailwind for major ETH investors.\n\nA few hours after the update, a whale scooped up $19.7 million worth of ETH. As of press time, ETH was up +3% in the past 24 hours and traded at $3.5K.\n\nAdditionally, the Open Interest (OI) rates were up 4%, denoting a substantial inflow of liquidity into the derivatives market and could give bulls a leg up."

        "content": "VanEck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel believes financial institutions are gearing up for the imminent launch of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US despite the funds pending regulatory approval.\n\nSigel said in a social media post on June 18 that hedge funds are strategically positioning themselves as they actively anticipate the ETFs will be approved.\n\nHe added that data from K33 Research indicates a significant rise in inflows to Ether exchange-traded products (ETPs) outside the US markets, which suggests that large investors are preparing for the regulatory green light for the spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAccording to Sigel:\n\n\u201cHedge funds are front-running the ETH ETF approvals, ETH on exchanges is near an all-time low, and fundamentals are improving. I could be eating BBQ HODL hat by July 4th. And you\u2019re bearish?\u201d\n\nSupporting this observation, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant reported a downtrend in ETH supply on exchanges, which is a sign that major players are accumulating Ethereum.\n\n\u2018Open-source App store\u2019\n\nIn a recent interview on the Bankless podcast, Sigel said that VanEck views Ethereum as an \u201copen-source App Store,\u201d positioning it as a more versatile and productive asset compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe firm believes that Ethereum ETFs could eventually become more successful than their Bitcoin counterparts due to the broader market for income-producing assets.\n\nAccording to Sigel:\n\n\u201cOverall, there\u2019s a bigger market for income-producing assets than for inert assets like Bitcoin (BTC). It\u2019s not impossible that in a decade, the market for an Ethereum ETF could surpass that of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSigel emphasized the need to educate traditional financial market participants about Ethereum\u2019s significance. He drew analogies to help clarify ETH\u2019s potential, highlighting its productive nature and its ability to allow anyone to create a storefront on its network at a lower cost than major tech companies.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cWe think of Ethereum as a productive asset that offers an open-source App Store with integrated payments functionality. We aim to elucidate the mechanics of how Ethereum works and provide a detailed analysis of its profit and loss statements.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

Farcaster still enjoys relatively low usage, but the platform still offers relatively high decentralization for users. Buterin spoke about the Lens Protocol, a decentralized application where users own their content, which speaks volumes about Ethereum\u2019s vision of bringing decentralized interaction online.\n\nWe're still here! And a lot of that idealistic open internet stuff has actually moved forward quite a bit, eg. we have farcaster and lens, quadratic and retroactive funding, zupass, privacy-preserving ways to send ETH, ZK voting implementations\u2026 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 19, 2024\n\nButerin highlighted the importance of quadratic funding for the Gitcoin Grants as a fairly fresh concept of community funding for projects. This means they can fund different projects depending on what the community wants, thus, funding moves in the direction of accomplishing collective will.\n\nHe also mentioned that post-launch funding encourages schemes that have already proved useful and effective in practice, thus helping developers engage in more meaningful, effective project development.\n\nPrivacy improvements are also important according to Buterin in future Ethereum development. Buterin mentioned using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and zero-knowledge voting as critical innovations that allow verification of transactions and votes that occur in a black-box fashion while preserving privacy in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhile meme coins have surged in popularity, often overshadowing more substantial, utility-driven projects, Buterin acknowledges this trend but contrasts it with the significant developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized social networks."

According to a recent report, the SEC informed ConsenSys that it is willing to end its investigation into Ethereum\u2019s status as a security. Following this announcement, the price of Ethereum (ETH) saw a significant bounce, rising 5% and nearing the $3,600 mark.

In the lawsuit, ConsenSys sought a declaration stating that offering these features doesn\u2019t violate securities laws under any condition.\n\nThe Ethereum software firm has also expressed frustration that a lawsuit is essential in order to bring the regulatory clarity essential for the industry to thrive. ConsenSys stated that clear guidelines are essential for the advancement of crypto technologies and innovations.\n\nFollowing the Wells Notice, the U.S. SEC has not yet charged ConsenSys regarding the MetaMask Wallet with swaps and staking features. ConsenSys made the Wells Notice public back in April, indicating that it could face charges in the forthcoming days and weeks.\n\nETH Price Surge Ahead\n\nFrom its weekly lows of $3,381, the Ethereum price has bounced back strongly. While the ICO whale has been dumping Ethereum recently, other big players have joined in to scoop the supply from the exchange.\n\nAs per on-chain data provider Santiment, a prominent whale has withdrawn a total of 16,604 ETH, valued at $58.6 million, from crypto exchange Binance in the past 19 days. The ETH whale reportedly purchase the coins at an average value of $3,600.\n\nInterestingly, the whale purchased an additional 5,603 ETH, worth $19.7 million an hour later the SEC announced permanent suspension of the investigation into Ethereum.\n\nThis big whale withdrew 16,604 $ETH (~$58.6M) from #Binance at an avg price of $3,600 in the past 19 days!

        "content": "The United States Justice Department has strongly opposed Virgil Griffith\u2019s plea to reduce his sentence for violating sanctions on North Korea.\n\nIn a filing on June 17th at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams argued against Griffith\u2019s request to shorten his prison term from 63 months to potentially as low as 51 months.\n\nFormer Ethereum developer Griffith was sentenced in April 2022 along with a $100,000 fine, with his projected release set for January 2026 considering time served.\n\nWilliams emphasized Griffith\u2019s deliberate actions, accusing him of intentionally evading U.S. sanctions to provide blockchain and cryptocurrency expertise to North Korea. Despite knowing the regime\u2019s aggressive stance and human rights abuses, Griffith\u2019s defense claimed he suffered from obsessive-compulsive and narcissistic personality disorders, contributing to his fascination with North Korea.\n\nImage Source: PACER (June 17 filing contests Virgil Griffith\u2019s sentence reduction motion)\n\nThe case stemmed from Griffith\u2019s participation in a 2019 blockchain conference in Pyongyang, where he reportedly lectured on how North Korea could use crypto to bypass sanctions. Prosecutors also pointed out disciplinary issues Griffith faced in prison, including minor infractions like attempting to steal soap and tea.\n\nGriffith\u2019s legal team sought a reduced sentence based on updated sentencing guidelines. They argued that under the revised rules, his prison term could be shortened by up to a year, potentially allowing for release in January 2025. During his sentencing, Griffith expressed remorse and claimed to have overcome his fixation on North Korea, citing the example of sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\nJudge Kevin Castel, however, noted Griffith\u2019s opportunistic behavior and lack of consistent ideology. Despite ongoing legal proceedings, the U.S. Department of Commerce has already imposed a 10-year export ban on Griffith, prohibiting him from engaging in transactions involving certain commodities, software, or technology until 2032.\n\nGriffith\u2019s legal team has been given 14 days to respond to the government\u2019s arguments. The outcome will determine whether Griffith\u2019s sentence is modified, but his future activities are already significantly restricted under existing sanctions."

        "title": "Comparing Avalanche and Ethereum: Which One Is Better? - Modern Diplomacy",
        "content": "Blockchain technology is developing quickly with several platforms springing up to meet the numerous demands and difficulties in the decentralized ecosystem. Among these, Ethereum and Avalanche stand out as two of the most prominent and innovative blockchain networks.\n\nDedicated platforms like Coindataflow.com offer a comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche price predictions. Developers, businesses, and investors can access complete information on prices, market capitalizations, charts, and statistics for both Avalanche and Ethereum. To find out which one is better, you should read the article below where we compare Avalanche and Ethereum.\n\nThe Basics of Ethereum\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, is a distributed platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It introduced the concept of a programmable blockchain, allowing for the creation of a wide range of applications beyond just cryptocurrencies. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, following Bitcoin.\n\nKey Features of Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts : The platform\u2019s primary innovation is its ability to execute smart agreements, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.\n\n: The platform\u2019s primary innovation is its ability to execute smart agreements, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) : The platform is the backbone of the DeFi movement, hosting numerous financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries.\n\n: The platform is the backbone of the DeFi movement, hosting numerous financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Wide Adoption: With a large developer community and numerous projects built on its platform, Ethereum boasts extensive adoption and a robust ecosystem.\n\nAvalanche: The Essentials\n\nAvalanche, launched in 2020 by Ava Labs, is a high-performance blockchain platform that aims to deliver unprecedented scalability, speed, and security. It utilizes a unique consensus mechanism called Avalanche consensus, which is a combination of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) protocols. Avalanche\u2019s native cryptocurrency, AVAX, has gained significant traction in the market.\n\nKey Features of Avalanche:\n\nHigh Throughput : Avalanche can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), significantly higher than Ethereum\u2019s current capacity.\n\n: Avalanche can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), significantly higher than Ethereum\u2019s current capacity. Low Latency : Transactions on Avalanche are confirmed in under a second, providing a seamless user experience.\n\n: Transactions on Avalanche are confirmed in under a second, providing a seamless user experience. Interoperability : Avalanche supports the creation of custom blockchains (subnets) that can interoperate with each other and other blockchain networks.\n\n: Avalanche supports the creation of custom blockchains (subnets) that can interoperate with each other and other blockchain networks. Eco-Friendly: Utilizing PoS, Avalanche is more energy-efficient compared to Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, which the latter plans to transition away from with Ethereum 2.0.\n\nComparison of the Crucial Aspects\n\nPerformance and Scalability\n\nWhen it comes to performance and scalability, Avalanche has a clear advantage over Ethereum. Avalanche\u2019s consensus mechanism allows it to achieve a higher TPS and lower latency, making it more suitable for applications requiring fast and efficient transactions.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current PoW mechanism limits its scalability, leading to network congestion and high gas fees during peak times. However, ETH\u2019s upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0, which will implement PoS, aims to address these issues and improve scalability.\n\nEcosystem and Adoption\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem is one of the largest in the blockchain space, with a vast number of dApps, DeFi protocols, and developer tools. The platform\u2019s first-mover advantage has resulted in widespread adoption and a strong network effect.\n\nIn contrast, Avalanche is relatively new but has quickly gained traction due to its superior performance and flexibility. However, the adoption of Avalanche is growing rapidly, with many projects choosing to build on its platform due to its technical advantages.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity is a critical aspect of any blockchain network. Ethereum has a long track record of being a secure platform, although it has faced some high-profile hacks and vulnerabilities in the past. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to enhance security further.\n\nAvalanche, with its novel consensus mechanism, also offers robust security features. Its PoS system reduces the risk of 51% attacks and ensures network stability.\n\nDevelopment and Flexibility\n\nBoth blockchain platforms offer flexible development environments. Ethereum\u2019s EVM is widely used and well-supported, making it easier for developers to create and deploy dApps.\n\nAvalanche, on the other hand, offers more flexibility with its subnet feature, allowing developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific use cases. This feature makes Avalanche an attractive option for enterprises and projects requiring specialized blockchain solutions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDetermining which blockchain platform is better between two notable blockchain platforms ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of the user. Ethereum boasts a mature ecosystem, extensive developer support, and a solid track record, making it a reliable choice for many projects. However, Avalanche\u2019s superior performance, scalability, and flexibility make it a compelling option, especially for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.\n\nAs Ethereum transitions to Ethereum 2.0, the competition between these two platforms is expected to intensify, bringing further innovations and improvements to the blockchain space. For developers, businesses, and investors, both Avalanche and Ethereum offer unique advantages that can be leveraged to build the next generation of decentralized applications and services.\n\nCarefully consider the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. Thus you can make an informed decision on which one best suits your needs in the constantly changing domain of blockchain technology."

        "content": "Wed 19 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nIn an unexpected turn that has galvanized the crypto market, Ethereum (ETH) experienced a 3% increase following the announcement of the SEC\u2019s conclusion of its investigation into Ethereum 2.0. This decision marks a decisive turning point for the blockchain industry and could have profound implications for the future of decentralized finance.\n\nTriumph for Ethereum! The crypto regulator ends the investigation!\n\nThe news was welcomed with enthusiasm by the Ethereum community! Because it dispels a large part of the regulatory uncertainty that weighed on the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. ConsenSys, a major player in Ethereum\u2019s development, confirmed that the SEC had closed its investigation without pressing charges. This implies that the sale of ETH is not considered a securities transaction.\n\nThe SEC concludes its investigation into Ethereum\n\nThis regulatory clarification comes at a crucial time for Ethereum, which is preparing for the transition to Ethereum 2.0. A major update aimed at improving the scalability and sustainability of the crypto network. This, by moving from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The SEC\u2019s decision could therefore accelerate the adoption and integration of Ethereum into traditional financial systems.\n\nA victory that propels Ethereum!\n\nThe immediate impact of this announcement was a significant increase in the price of Ethereum! The ETH crypto surged to over $3,100! Supported by a favorable court victory and increased network activity. Investors and developers see this as a validation of Ethereum\u2019s legitimacy as a commodity rather than a security, which could encourage further innovation and investment in the space.\n\nHowever, despite this victory, ConsenSys continues its legal battle to obtain clear regulations for the crypto industry. Which is essential for the innovation and growth of blockchain technology. The company is seeking a declaration that offering user interfaces for services such as MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate securities laws.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nThe end of the SEC\u2019s investigation into Ethereum 2.0 is a major victory for the entire crypto industry. It could not only boost investor confidence in Ethereum but also set a precedent for how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the future.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Choosing Polygon over Ethereum to Build Efficient dApps - Appinventiv",
        "content": "Polygon aims to give people numerous choices when they create dApp on Polygon. Some developers keep security over speed while others compromise on security for lowered fees and speed \u2013 the technology is building multiple Ethereum-centric scaling solutions to address all these different features.\n\nEthereum has remained a pillar in the cryptocurrency space. Right from DeFi to smart contracts and even NFTs, Ethereum has remained one of the key innovations of Web3. However, inspite of the glaring success, the technology has struggled with massive network congestion, high network fees, and lowering transaction throughput \u2013 factors that have created a scope for newer crypto projects coming in to scale it. Polygon is one such project.\n\nOriginated in 2017, India-based software company Polygon Technology scales Ethereum without sacrificing on its decentralization benefits. With the number of dApps on Polygon having reached 53,000, businesses are using the technology\u2019s low fees and fast speed to build Ethereum-powered dApps.\n\nIn this article, we are going to look into the different facets of Polygon and what makes the technology better than using Ethereum for dApps development.\n\nHow does the Polygon dApp builder work?\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables developers to build dApps on Ethereum without getting stuck with Ethereum\u2019s limitations.\n\nHow it does that is by developing a layer 2 solution using off-chain on-chain concepts and different governance models like Proof of Stake, which helps the network lower its energy footprint by 99.95% \u2013 one which Etherum has also reached after The Merge. In addition to using a PoS architecture where the network participants stake MATIC for validating the transactions, Polygon enables developers to use its open source SDK to launch their Polygon dApp at the back of multiple scaling techniques:\n\nZK-Rollups: The ethereum-based technology acquired a zero-knowledge (ZK) protocol developer, Mir, for USD 400 million. What this protocol does is it enables transaction authenticators to validate the encrypted data without actually accessing the information enabling them to generate the verification proof in under 170 milliseconds.\n\nOptimistic Rollups: It consists of bundling several off-chain transactions into massive batches before submitting them in Ethereum. This way, the fixed costs get spread across multiple transactions that reduce the end-user fees. In essence, this scaling technique assumes off-chain transactions validity without pushing out validity proofs for the on-chain transaction batches by following a fraud-proving methodology to identify transactions having discrepancies.\n\nPlasma Chains: This scaling technique builds a child-parent relationship in Ethereum\u2019s main chain. For example, the plasma chains can deploy their own dApps on Polygon which comes in handy when the other sidechains get hacked or are down. Additionally, the plasma chains tend to deliver off-chain transactions at higher efficiency levels.\n\nAt the back of these scaling methods, while the answer to how much time does it take to build dApp on Polygon is same as that on Ethereum or other blockchain technology, the transaction speed and cost difference is unmatched.\n\nFeatures of Polygon for dApp development\n\nThe technology merges the capabilities of sovereign blockchains and Ethereum into an attractive feature set that helps developers build a decentralized app on Polygon that is highly efficient, scalable, and speedy.\n\nEthereum compatibility\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon you work on a platform with complete Ethereum compatibility to tech stack, languages, standards, and tools.\n\nHigh scalability\n\nThe technology is built on dedicated blockchains, a scalable consensus algorithm, and a customized Wasm execution environment.\n\nCompetitive network Greater security\n\nPolygon dApp development is built on a modular \u201csecurity as a service\u201d facility offered either by Ethereum or a pool or validators.\n\nInteroperability\n\nThe technology comes with a native support for the arbitrary messaging passing bridges for external systems and can easily connect with Ethereum main chain using the bridging SDKs polygon offers.\n\nGood user experience\n\nWhen you build dApp on Polygon it is very similar to one on Web2 purely at the back of a facility like instantaneous transaction finality.\n\nModularity\n\nPolygon comes with high extensibility, customization, upgradability, community collaboration, and a short time-to-market.\n\nThese features of Polygon for dApp development are designed to bring the technology at par with the adoption of Ethereum minus all the limitations of the latter. This makes it profitable for developers and enterprises alike to build a decentralized app on Polygon.\n\nAmidst these feature sets and the obvious benefits of Polygon for dApp development, is it time to let go of Ethereum? And on a technological level, what difference does Ethereum hold from Polygon dApp development?\n\nCreating dApps on Polygon vs Ethereum\n\nWhile The Merge moved Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, bringing down its 112 TWh of energy consumption down to 0.01 TWh, the technology is where Polygon already is.\n\nThe Merge however, didn\u2019t change the high variable transaction cost that Ethereum comes with \u2013 a factor that Polygon addresses on a massive extent. In addition to this, the transaction processing speed has also remained unchanged, which in case of Polygon dApps development is only 65,000 transactions per second at the back of the Layer 2 scalability solution.\n\nLet us look into the differences to understand why it makes sense to build dApps on Polygon.\n\nFactors Ethereum Polygon Foundation 2013 2017 Scalability 10 TPS 7000 Market Cap 139.56 Billion 7.698 Billion Average transaction fees 0.4876 US$0.01 Programming language Solidity Solidity, Golang, Vyper Transaction Deterministic Finality Instant 5 minutes Total dApps 2970 53,000\n\nWhile Polygon\u2019s popularity is on a fast rise, there are some issues that are still prevalent in the technology. For understanding Polygon to its entirety, it is critical to know the limitations it comes attached with. Let us give a brief look at them:\n\nEthereum Dependency: Ethereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations.\n\nEthereum lies at the center of Polygon\u2019s ecosystem as its settlement layer. This has resulted in Polygon being completely dependent on Ethereum for its operations. Under Development: Presently, Polygon comes with Matic POS Chains and Matic Plasma as scaling solutions.

Other scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zk Rollups, Sidechains, Validum Chains, and Enterprise Chains, etc. are still in their developmental stages with an unsurety around when they would be live. Matic Plasma Chains: Polygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma.\n\nPolygon plasma chains can only be used for a limited set of use cases. Comparatively, POS Chains are a lot more famous since they offer greater user experiences and flexibility when compared to Matic Plasma. Competition: There are a number of scaling solutions such as Solana, Cosmos, Polkadot, etc. which are gaining steady momentum. They are making use of Ethereum and other blockchains to offer better user experience. Amidst this, we might see other solutions coming up and taking Polygon\u2019s market share.\n\nWith everything we have covered up until this point, one thing is clear \u2013 even though the technology has some limitations which need to be addressed, the benefits of Polygon for dApp development are unignorable. However, for an entrepreneur what is necessary is to know the use cases on which they can create dApp on Polygon.\n\nThe use cases to build dApp on Polygon\n\nThe biggest reason why dApp development service providers like Appinventiv choose Polygon is the fact that the end product is the same as what results from Ethereum app development but the customer experience is much greater. So while the businesses get the same Ethereum-powered app, their users get an innovative user experience, higher lowered transaction speed, and minimal transaction fees.\n\nPayments: Polygon platform is engineered to create dApps that speed up the payment process, powering almost real-time payment settlement via specialized API and SDK integration. This enables apps, users, and merchants to instantly perform transactions through multiple cryptocurrencies, usually through the ETH or ERC-20 tokens. This system is being rolled out in three distinct phases: 1. ERC-20 token payments 2. Token transfer in cross-chain 3. Fiat-based payment models.\n\nLending Platform: The next use case to consider when you build dApp on Polygon is creating a module that would enable lenders to analyze users credit ratings and building a smart contract that would automate the loan disbursement journey.\n\nGames: The Layer 2 sidechain scaling solution of Polygon makes blockchain-based gaming platform development efficient and fast. With Ethereum and Polygon working together, the platform will be able to address the lag issues that non-Polygon blockchain games face.\n\nOther Use Cases: There are a range of other use cases to consider when you build a decentralized app on Polygon such as enabling fast settlement times required for decentralized exchanges to provide faster and cheaper trading.\n\n[Also Read: How to monetize with your dApp?]\n\nAmidst these use cases, the Polygon ecosystem is fast expanding. Here\u2019s a look into some of the top applications that are a part of the network\n\nAdditionally, most of the dApps require a method to sign transactions without submitting in the users\u2019 private keys details. On the back of its scalability enhancements, the technology helps in enabling an open identity framework for the dApp, thus solving the privacy issue.\n\nThese use cases are only a surface-level explanation of why businesses should develop dApp on Polygon. There are a range of other applications that can be built on Polygon.\n\nUltimately, even though Polygon dApps are built upon Ethereum, there are some very critical differences between them, specifically in transaction speed and cost. Such costly gas fees and slow transactions can lead to poor user experience that would leave a negative impact on the platform\u2019s adoption. On this note, it makes better business sense to select Polygon, thanks to its ability to back faster transactions and lowered gas fees.\n\nAt Appinventiv, it is our constant endeavor to think about our clients\u2019 customers first and this is the reason why we make dApp on Polygon. Using the technology we have built a range of decentralized apps right from a crypto wallet app to a DeFi exchange all promising a positive customer experience.\n\nLooking to explore the technology for your next dApp project?

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) to Start Gaining Some Strength, Is XRP Finally in Uptrend? Shiba Inu (SHIB) May Still Hit $0.00002: Here's How - U.Today",

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is finally regaining some of its lost position. The second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market has already tested the $3,600 threshold. While the 26 EMA break did not happen, the fact that Ethereum tested that threshold may become a foundation for a bullish reversal in the foreseeable future.\n\nEthereum needs to rise above critical support levels in the near future. In particular, the $3,400 and $3,352 support levels are crucial. Ethereum could indicate strength and the possibility of further upward momentum if it can stay above these supports.\n\nTraders are keeping a careful eye on these levels for any indications of persistently bullish activity. The most likely reason behind the reversal is the exhaustion of bulls.\n\nInvestors should monitor the $3,600 resistance level, as a break above it may trigger a fresh upswing in price. Overall Ethereum's long-term potential \u2014 fueled by growing adoption thanks to the ETF and technological advancements \u2014 remains intact even though short-term fluctuations are to be expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's surprising strength\n\nXRP faces a 26 EMA resistance level after the bounce from $0.46, which is a strong signal for the asset. Despite losing the $0.5 support level, the short-term outlook is surprisingly positive for XRP. Key resistance levels to watch include $0.52 and $0.54, where a break above these could indicate further upward movement.\n\nA sustained price above $0.46 is critical for XRP in the near term. With its solid support, this level might serve as the basis for a resurgence. As long as XRP can overcome the immediate resistance at $0.52, traders are hopeful about a possible rebound.\n\nStill, there is cause for concern regarding the asset's long-term performance. The future of XRP is clouded by enduring regulatory challenges, most notably the ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. Since bad news can cause prices to drop sharply, market sentiment is also an important consideration.\n\nThe outcome of these legal challenges and public perception of the cryptocurrency market will have a significant impact on XRP's long-term prospects. Even though the short-term outlook is promising and could result in gains if resistance levels are overcome, investors should exercise caution. XRP has a number of long-term issues that could affect how well it performs in the upcoming months.\n\nShiba Inu is plummeting\n\nShiba Inu's drop below $0.00002 was dramatic and clearly should be treated as a signal of a potentially upcoming price drop. However, there is an important factor to consider: the short-term price drop is not set in stone, so bulls may still have enough reserves to buy back.\n\nSpecifically, $0.000019, $0.000022 and $0.000023 are three important price levels to keep an eye on. Each of these levels represents potential resistance or support areas that could determine Shiba Inu's next move.\n\nAt these prices a significant buyback might stop the current downward trend but if it does not hold, losses could continue. Short-term maintenance above $0.000019 is critical. A breakdown below this level could result in additional selling pressure because it has served as a significant level of support. On the other hand, a recovery of $0.000022 and $0.000023 would suggest a return of bullish momentum and might draw additional buyers into the market.\n\nThe popularity of Shiba Inu is fueled by its active social media presence and thriving community frequently causing their prices to fluctuate sharply. Sentiment can shift quickly, which can have a major impact on price, so traders need to be prepared for that.\n\nFurthermore, Shiba Inu's performance may be impacted by changes in the larger cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu's long-term prospects hinge on its capacity to sustain interest and usage among the cryptocurrency community. Long-term growth may be possible for the project if it keeps coming up with new ideas and draws in users."

        "content": "Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty and pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan still believe the SEC\u2019s decision to end an investigation into Ethereum 2.0 does not absolve ETH of regulatory uncertainty.\n\nBoth legal experts expressed this view shortly after Ethereum developer Consensys Inc. revealed that the SEC does not recommend an enforcement action based on its investigations into certain sales of ETH.\n\nRipple CLO Highlights Regulatory Uncertainty Surrounding Ethereum\n\nReacting, the Ripple CLO congratulated Consensys on the win but raised concerns about the uncertainty regarding ETH\u2019s regulatory status.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe quizzed whether the conclusion of the Ethereum 2.0 investigation indicates the SEC does not think Consensys offered ETH as a security. Additionally, he suggested that the SEC might still view ETH as a security.\n\nFurthermore, Alderoty questioned SEC chair Gary Gensler\u2019s potential response regarding ETH\u2019s regulatory status. Lastly, the Ripple CLO noted that the regulatory status of Metamask\u2019s staking and swap services could be in question due to the SEC\u2019s refusal to address the matter in its recent response.\n\nHe expressed frustration with the lack of clear regulatory guidance for the U.S. crypto industry, which could hinder innovation in the country.\n\nA big win for Consensys, though questions remain. Does this mean the SEC thinks Consensys\u2019 offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions and/or that ETH itself is not a security? What will Gensler say if now asked? What is the status of MetaMask and staking? This is\u2026 \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 19, 2024\n\nPro-Ripple Lawyer Reacts\n\nPro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan echoed a similar sentiment, suggesting that the SEC\u2019s decision not to pursue enforcement action following its Ethereum 2.0 investigation fails to clarify the regulatory status of the second-biggest crypto by market cap.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe contrasted the regulatory ambiguity surrounding ETH with the legal clarity XRP received from a federal judge last year, raising a rhetorical question about which situation is preferable.\n\nCome on people. Would you prefer a letter like this sent to one company, or a finding from a judge that a token itself is not a security. Gensler will continue not to answer when asked whether Ethereum is a security. He can\u2019t do that with XRP. pic.twitter.com/kPbeirslFE \u2014 bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 19, 2024\n\nFurthermore, the lawyer speculated that Gensler would continue to refrain from answering whether ETH is a security but cannot do so with XRP. This is because U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres held that XRP in itself is not a security.\n\nFight Continues\n\nThough the SEC has ended investigations into Ethereum 2.0, Consensys is still embroiled in a lawsuit against the securities regulator. The Ethereum developer filed the suit in April, requesting a Texas court to declare the staking and swap services offered on Metamask as non-securities.\n\nSince the SEC did not comment on the status of Metamask\u2019s staking and swap services, Consensys stated that its legal fight with the regulator would continue."

        "title": "Double-Whammy For Ethereum: Price Collapses, Exchange Supply Dries Up - TradingView",
        "content": "The winds of change are blowing through the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem. Despite tentative signs of recovery after recent dips, the price has struggled to stay afloat in the last 30 days. Additionally, a more intriguing trend has emerged: a mass exodus of ETH from cryptocurrency exchanges. This movement, marked by declining exchange supply and net outflows, has analysts buzzing with potential bullish implications.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Takes Control In Market Meltdown, Dominance Climbs To 9-Week Peak\n\nDwindling Stockpiles: Exchanges Feeling The Squeeze\n\nFor years, cryptocurrency exchanges have served as the lifeblood of the digital asset market. They provide the platform for buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies, with a significant portion of any given coin\u2019s total supply residing within their digital vaults. However, when it comes to ETH, a dramatic shift seems to be underway.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nAccording to a recent analysis of on-chain data, the balance of ETH on exchanges has plummeted to its lowest level in eight years, hovering around a mere 10.20%. This translates to a significant portion of ETH holders withdrawing their coins from exchanges, effectively taking them off the market for immediate sale.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nThe reasons behind this exodus remain open to speculation. Some experts believe it could be a strategic move in anticipation of the upcoming Ethereum Merge, a major network upgrade that will transition the blockchain from proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model. This shift could potentially unlock staking opportunities for ETH holders, incentivizing them to hold onto their coins for longer periods.\n\nOutflows Dominate: A Sign Of Accumulation Or Caution?\n\nFurther bolstering the \u201caccumulation theory\u201d is the dominance of net outflows on exchanges in recent days. This metric tracks the difference between ETH entering and leaving exchange wallets. A negative netflow, as seen currently, indicates that more ETH is flowing out than coming in. This suggests that investors are not only withdrawing their existing holdings but also refraining from depositing new ETH onto exchanges, potentially signaling a growing sense of long-term bullishness.\n\nHowever, some analysts caution against overly optimistic interpretations. The decline in exchange supply could also be attributed to a more cautious investor sentiment in the face of recent market volatility. With the broader cryptocurrency market still recovering from a slump, some holders might be opting to move their ETH to private wallets for safekeeping, waiting for a more opportune moment to re-enter the market.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView"

The continuous discussion about securities laws and cryptocurrency rules has reached a turning point with this ruling.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.

This means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nSEC Drops Ethereum 2.0 Investigation\n\nConsenSys announced that the Enforcement Division of the SEC has decided against filing charges claiming that ETH sales qualify as securities transactions.\n\nThis result follows a June 7 letter from ConsenSys asking the SEC to verify that the May approvals of ETH Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) signaled the end of the Ethereum 2.0 inquiry because ETH is a commodity.\n\nBlockchain researcher Collin Brown and many other cryptocurrency enthusiasts applauded the announcement. \u2018Ripple (XRP) will follow, knowing they are on the right side of history,\u2019 Brown said. The crypto community, which has long been scrutinized by the SEC\u2019s strict enforcement system, shares this opinion in large measure.\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING \ud83d\udea8#Ethereum 2.0 gets the green light!

CoinMarketCap reports that the price of ETH at the moment of writing is at $3,567.10, up 3.48% over the previous day. With a 1.26% increase over the last week, ETH has remained bullish, reflecting robust market confidence in the wake of the SEC ruling.\n\nPrevious to this, CNF reported on updated estimates from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas that Ethereum ETFs may start trading as early as July 2. This move strengthens confidence in Ethereum and the larger crypto market by offering a more controlled and stable setting for business expansion.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price increased by nearly 3% in the last seven days.\n\nSelling pressure on ETH continued to remain high.\n\nWhile most cryptos\u2019 prices were declining, Ethereum [ETH] decoupled from the market as it went the other way. In fact, the king of altcoins was outshining Bitcoin [BTC] on a key front, which hinted at a bull rally in the coming days.\n\nEthereum beats Bitcoin\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH bulls stepped up their game over the last seven days as the token\u2019s price increased. The token\u2019s daily chart also remained green as it moved up marginally.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,575.26 with a market capitalization of over $437 billion.\n\nWhile that happened, Ki Young Ju, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet pointing out an interesting development.\n\nAs per the tweet, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio was rising, suggesting that ETH\u2019s market was heating up relative to its on-chain fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, ETH managed to outperform Bitcoin in terms of MVRV ratio growth rate. The tweet also mentioned that, given the current ETF situation, this might be an ETH-only season.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that historically, when ETH surges, other alts tend to follow.\n\nIs ETH ready for a bull rally?\n\nSince the aforementioned dataset suggested that the chances of ETH showcasing a bullish performance were high, AMBCrypto planned to check its on-chain metrics.\n\nAs per our analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven days\u2019 average, meaning that selling pressure was high.\n\nAdditionally, its Coinbase premium was red, indicating that selling sentiment was dominant among US investors. Nonetheless, the Korea premium looked optimistic as it indicated that Korean investors were willing to buy ETH.\n\nA few of the technical indicators also looked bullish on the king of altcoins. For instance, the MACD displayed the possibility of a bullish crossover.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick and was resting at the neutral mark at press time.\n\nAdditionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also moved northward, hinting at a price increase in the coming days.\n\nAMBCrypto then checked Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to look for possible targets for this week if ETH remains bullish.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nWe found that ETH might first touch $3,660, as liquidation would rise sharply at that level. A rise in liquidation often results in short-term price corrections.\n\nA successful breakout above that level might allow ETH to reach $3.8k. However, if the bears takeover, then investors might witness ETH drop to $3.28k this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "U.Today - is finally entering reversal mode, with the price of the first cryptocurrency sliding in above the $65,000 zone. However, it is still moving below key support levels like the 50 EMA and is currently consolidating at the 100 EMA. The most decisive factor for a recovery would be momentum that is not present at this exact moment.\n\nIt is critical that Bitcoin maintains above $65,000 for the near future. Strong support has been seen at this level, which might serve as the basis for a reversal. If Bitcoin is able to overcome the immediate resistance at the 50 EMA or roughly $67,000, traders are hopeful of a possible rebound.\n\nAdditionally, the RSI which is centered on 47, shows that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold, pointing to a period of consolidation prior to any notable movement. The macroeconomic environment as a whole is one factor influencing Bitcoin's current performance. Investor sentiment in a variety of markets, including cryptocurrency, has been influenced by worries about inflation and possible interest rate increases by central banks.\n\nBitcoin's long-term prospects are still promising despite these obstacles because of its growing institutional adoption and ability to act as an inflation hedge. Given its continued institutional interest and widespread adoption, Bitcoin's long-term prospects appear bright.\n\n's questionable position\n\nWhile Solana clearly gained some respectable strength back in May, the situation for the asset has changed, and it has been going down steadily for the past 20 days. The SOLETH chart, often used for gauging market volatility, is clearly exhausted and might provide us with some growth in the future.\n\nThe Solana vs. chart, which contrasts the two most powerful altcoins available, is an important comparison. This comparison makes the relative strength and possible volatility of the altcoin market easier for traders and investors to understand.\n\nA positive outlook for altcoins overall is frequently indicated by Solana's strong performance versus Ethereum and vice versa. Because SOLETH captures the growth and performance dynamics of two significant cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin, it is regarded as a barometer for market volatility. In the domains of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), Solana and Ethereum are renowned for their strong ecosystems and noteworthy use cases.\n\nSignificant movements in these two assets may point to more general trends on the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum frequently serves as a benchmark since it is the bigger and more well known of the two. Conversely, Solana stands for more recent quickly expanding blockchain initiatives. It is possible to infer market sentiment regarding innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency space from the interaction of these two assets on the chart.\n\n's unexpected bounce\n\nCardano somewhat bounced from a local support level at approximately $0.35, with the potential to fight with the 26 EMA for momentum in the next few days. This bounce is a small but crucial step toward breaking an aggravating downtrend that has plagued the cryptocurrency for months.\n\nHolding above $0.35 is critical for Cardano in the near term. This level has provided a lot of support and might provide the groundwork for a future upswing. Cardano may indicate the start of a recovery phase if it can muster enough momentum to test and possibly break above the 26 EMA.\n\nAn RSI of about 37 indicates that ADA is in oversold territory, which may draw in buyers searching for cheap points of entry. But Cardano has not exactly performed well over the long haul. Even with the community's strong support and the project's lofty objectives, ADA has had difficulty holding onto its value. Cardano has experienced a protracted decline and has not been able to return to its prior highs since hitting its all-time high in early 2022.\n\nNumerous reasons contribute to this subpar performance, including the general mood of competition from rival blockchain platforms and slower-than-anticipated development progress. Although anticipated by many investors, the Cardano ecosystem has not yet produced the ground-breaking applications.\n\nAlthough the deployment of smart contracts on the Cardano network was a big step forward, neither the number of dApps nor user adoption has increased significantly as a result of it. Some investors have become frustrated with ADA's slow development, which has made them doubt the company's long-term prospects.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

        "content": "ETH ETF launch is now closer than ever as issuers begin submitting amended S-1s.\n\nWhales have been positioning for launch, suggesting ETFs will be a key market catalyst in summer.\n\nMarket analysts have been waiting for amended S-1s (registration statements) from potential spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF issuers, which are the last step before the SEC approves them for launch.\n\nDigital asset manager and potential issuer, Bitwise, began this last step on 18th June. It submitted its amended S-1 to the agency, but the fee charges haven\u2019t been included yet.\n\nReacting to the update, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted,\n\n\u2018I believe this filing from @BitwiseInvest is the first of the amended #Ethereum ETF S-1\u2019s. This will contain the changes from the SEC\u2019s first round of comments.\u2019\n\nThe analyst added that Pantera Capital, a crypto-focused VC firm, was planning to put $100 million into Bitwise\u2019s ETH ETF product (ETHW)\n\n\u2018Looks like Panterra will be putting up to $100 million into @BitwiseInvest\u2019s Ethereum ETF \u2014 $ETHW\u2019\n\nThe VC reportedly pumped $200 million into Bitwise\u2019s spot US BTC ETF product in January.\n\nOther issuers are expected to submit their amended S-1s in the coming days. However, Seyffart noted that the amends \u2018might not need additional but might require tweaks\u2019.\n\n4th July in focus for ETH ETF approvals\n\nAlong with his colleague, Eric Balchunas, the analysts maintained that the products could be approved and launched by 4th July.\n\nThe SEC chair, Garry Gensler, recently confirmed that the approvals could be likely by summer. Overall, most market observers expected an approval by early July.\n\nThat said, there have been divergent views on institutional demand for ETH ETF products. Some projected low demand since the products won\u2019t have a \u2018staking\u2019 feature.\n\nHowever, Ophelia Snyder, co-founder of digital asset manager 21Shares, maintained that the lack of staking will not affect institutional demand.\n\nIn fact, the executive added that staking could affect liquidity, especially when the lock-up period is extended.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH was up +4% in the past 24 hours and traded at $3.54K. Besides, ETH whales were on the move as they eyed the potential launch of the ETH ETF in early July."

        "content": "Ethereum popularity increased materially according to recent data.\n\nStaking participation was on the rise as prices remained stable.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] price has remained stagnant over the past few days. Despite this traders were showing interest in the altcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity grows\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the popularity of ETH had soared significantly over the last few days.\n\nThe current discussions surrounding Ethereum ETFs, SEC investigations, regulatory developments, and Consensys\u2019 advocacy efforts for Ethereum\u2019s status are likely contributing to this increased attention.\n\nThere were both bearish and bullish perspectives that can be had around the popularity of the rising interest in Ethereum.\n\nSantiment\u2019s data suggested that the bearish concerns stemmed from the potential classification of Ethereum as a commodity by the SEC.\n\nDespite SEC dropping the investigation, the fact that it is willing to go after the coin can cause problems for the network. It could also pose a hurdle for the approval of other Ethereum ETFs, a key driver of current interest.\n\nAdditionally, the ongoing regulatory battle between Ripple and the SEC casted a shadow, as similar actions against ETH could dampen market sentiment.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status and its potential limitations act as headwinds for the project.\n\nFrom the bullish perspective, there were a lot of points in favor of Ethereum. For instance, the SEC dropping its investigation, effectively clearing ETH sales of being securities, has been a major boost.\n\nThis news has led to a surge in ETH-related altcoins and a more stable market environment.\n\nFurthermore, the development of cross-chain bridges connecting Ethereum to other blockchains showcased continued growth and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nState of staking\n\nIn terms of staking, it was observed that the staking participation rate increased significantly for ETH. However, staking yield volatility had surged materially.\n\nWhile a higher participation rate is generally good, high volatility in yields can be a deterrent for some stakers seeking predictable returns.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nThis volatility could be due to factors like fluctuations in network fees (MEV) or changes in the total amount of staked ETH.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,587.52. Over the last 24 hours, the price of ETH grew by 0.67%. However, the volume at which ETH was trading at had fallen by 27% during the same period."

        "content": "Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley on Thursday said there will be a major announcement by Bitwise Invest tomorrow. Bitwise recently filed an amended spot Ethereum ETF S-1 to disclose a $2.5 million seed investment and Pantera\u2019s interest in putting $100 million in the Ether ETF.\n\nBitwise Likely Making An S-1 Filing For Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nHunter Horsley, chief executive officer of Bitwise Invest, took to X on June 20 and revealed a big announcement coming from the company. He said \u201cKeep an eye on Bitwise Invest tomorrow. Something cool.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile Horsley\u2019s post didn\u2019t mention enough details or points to another S-1 amendment to spot Ethereum ETF, experts believe it will be related to Ether ETF.\n\nNate Geraci, president of ETF Store, said a flurry of spot Ethereum ETF S-1 amendments are coming on Thursday and Friday. He believes there\u2019s nothing left for the U.S. SEC to address or comment on as per details in the Bitwise S-1 recent filing.\n\nGeraci thinks spot Ethereum ETF will launch before July 4 as SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinted at the approval of Ether ETFs before the end of summer. The SEC has also closed its Ethereum investigation, clearing the way for a potential listing and trading of spot Ether ETFs on exchanges.\n\nHe expects Bitwise to reveal fees for its spot Ether ETF on Friday.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Upcoming ETH ETF Trading Teases $5,000-Bound Rally - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The Ether and crypto communities are eagerly looking forward to the start of spot ETF trading in the US. This follows insight from a renowned ETF analyst who projects the D-Day on July 2. In the meantime, ETH price holds firmly to support at $3,500. A breakout from this level could breach the $4,000 resistance which will ignite FOMO as investors back the uptrend toward $5,000.\n\nBitcoin too is starting to shape the next crypto landscape this week after reclaiming ground above $65,500. With the two largest cryptocurrencies modestly in the green, investors are beginning to appreciate the sell-off as a blessing in disguise. This means they can apply key dollar cost-averaging practices, buy the dips, and eventually increase potential gains in the second half of the year.\n\nFactors Likely To Drive The Next Altcoin Season\n\nThe crypto fear and greed index has fallen to 64\u2014still showing greed among investors but significantly below last week\u2019s figure of 74. This indicator by Alternative, monitors market sentiment with zero on the scale referring to extreme fear and 100 to extreme greed.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSince markets function as living entities, sentiment is driven by people. As euphoria increases, investors become greedy due to the FOMO. This propels prices higher but also introduces the risk of a drastic decline as some investors decide to take profits. It is rarely a good idea to buy when the crypto fear and greed index is near the extreme top.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, a drop in the metrics suggests greed is creeping in. Because sentiment is falling, many people choose to sell\u2014some due to the fear of losing their capital or possibly to protect unrealized gains.\n\nIt is advisable to buy when the market is red and sell when it is green. With that in mind, investors might consider this to be a good time to buy into their favorite altcoins, ignoring the drop in the fear and greed index to 64.\n\nEthereum price has increased 1.3% in 24 hours to $3,585 on Thursday. The value growth, although minor, has reflected a 0.81% surge in the market cap to $438 billion. However, the second-largest digital asset faces a 30% slide in the trading volume to $14 billion\u2014a factor likely to hamper potential growth in the upcoming sessions.\n\nNevertheless, investors seem to have set their sight on the approvable of the spot ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of spot Ethereum ETFs in May pending further approval for the operators of the products which will eventually give way to actual trading on stock exchanges.\n\nThe SEC also dropped investigations into Ethereum, further clearing doubts that Ether could be considered a security.\n\nETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted earlier this week that Ethereum ETFs could start trading on July 2. This followed word that the SEC \u201csent issuers comments on S-1s today, and they\u2019re pretty light, nothing major, asking for them back in a week.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: we are moving up our over/under date for the launch of spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, hearing the Staff sent issuers comments on S-1s today, and they're pretty light, nothing major, asking for them back in a week. Decent chance they work to declare them effective the next\u2026 https://t.co/XJZ8JLwEFF \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 14, 2024\n\nThe start of the actual trading of Ethereum ETFs could spark fresh interest in ETH and altcoins. Traditional investors would find it easier to buy ETH via exchanges, validating the crypto market.\n\nAnalysts at CoinGape expect this to be a moment of reckoning for altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin which are believed to be the next in line for spot ETFs.\n\nThe move could be bullish for the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin, and possibly usher in the much-anticipated altcoin season.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Stares At A 30% Breakout\n\nEthereum price is making key strides in its recovery following the correction to $3,400. The token currently sits above two exponential moving averages (EMAs), the 20-day and the 50-day.\n\nA daily close above $3,600 resistance would mean that bulls are getting back in the game for a breakout past $4,000. The presence of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern on the daily chart could reinforce the bullish grip when validated.\n\nThis is a bullish pattern validated when the price breaches the neckline resistance around $3,800 in Ethereum price prediction case. Traders would enter above this resistance eyeing a 30% move close to $5,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Bitcoin price action shows a bullish divergence on a momentum indicator.\n\nEthereum price finds support around $3,362 price low from Friday.\n\nRipple price faces rejection by its daily resistance level of $0.499 level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price action shows a bullish divergence on a momentum indicator, signaling a forthcoming bullish trend. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are poised to mirror Bitcoin's trajectory, preparing to breach resistance levels and rally upwards in tandem.\n\nBitcoin price action indicates bullish momentum\n\nBitcoin price was rejected by the weekly resistance level of $67,147 on Monday and fell by 2.2%. BTC is currently supported by its 50% retracement level at $64,274, calculated from the swing low of $56,523 on May 1 to a swing high of $71,995 on May 21.\n\nIf BTC bounces off $64,274, it could rally 4% to reach its previous resistance level of $67,147.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) support this aforementioned bounce. The lower low formed in the 4-chart on June 18 does not reflect the RSI's higher high for the same period. This development is termed a bullish divergence and often leads to the reversal of the trend or a short-term rally.\n\nIf the bulls are aggressive and the overall crypto market outlook is positive, then BTC could extend an additional rally of 6% to reach its previous resistance level of $71,280.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin's price breaks and closes below its daily support level of $60,800, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, leading to a 4% decline , its weekly support level of $58,375.\n\nEthereum price shows potential for a rally\n\nEthereum price finds support around Friday's low of $3,360, which is currently trading at $3,533. The $3,360 low roughly hovers the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,279.\n\nIf this support holds, then ETH price could rally 3% from its current trading price of $3,533 to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) breaks above its mean level of 50 in the 4-hour chart, and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is on its way to doing the same. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators need to maintain their positions above their respective mean levels. Such a development would add a tailwind to the recovery rally.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, it could extend an additional rally of 6% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes below the $3,292 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 13% crash to the previous support level of $2,864.\n\nRipple price poised for a breakout\n\nRipple's price faced resistance at $0.515, its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), on Monday and fell by 3%. XRP is currently trading at $0.495.\n\nIf Ripple price breaks above the 50-day EMA at $0.515, it could rise 7% from $0.499 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily chart is below the 50 mean level, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is below its zero line. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators need to maintain their positions above their respective mean levels of 50 and zero. Such a development would boost the recovery rally.\n\nIf the bulls are aggressive and the overall crypto-market outlook is positive, the XRP price could extend an additional 9% to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ripple's price produces a daily candlestick close below $0.450, the daily low from June 7, the move would invalidate the bullish thesis by making a lower low on the daily time frame. This development could see XRP's price decline 7% to the April 13 low of $0.419."

        "title": "3 Reasons Why SEC Can Approve Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 Filings By July 2 - CoinGape",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve the long-awaited Spot Ethereum ETF filings by July 2. This move comes amidst several key factors aligning towards regulatory clarity and increased market interest in crypto-based investment products. Moreover, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had previously revealed that they have pushed the potential Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 approval date to July 2.\n\n1. ConsenSys Vs. SEC Investigation Resolution\n\nOne pivotal reason behind the anticipated approval of Spot Ethereum ETF filings is the recent progress in regulatory discussions between ConsenSys and the SEC. ConsenSys, a prominent blockchain technology company, sought clarification on the SEC\u2019s stance regarding Ethereum\u2019s status as a security. This came in the context of their ongoing investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThereafter, the SEC announced the conclusion of this investigation. This development signals a significant shift in their approach towards Ethereum. Moreover, the resolution of this investigation is crucial as it sets a precedent for Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, potentially mitigating concerns over its classification as a security. With ConsenSys paving the way for regulatory clarity, the SEC may view this as a favorable signal towards approving Spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking: Bitwise Files Amended Ethereum ETF S-1 After SEC Feedback\n\n2. Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 Amendments by Applicants\n\nAnother key factor influencing the timeline for SEC approval is the proactive approach taken by ETF applicants such as Bitwise. Recently, Bitwise diligently amended their S-1 filings in response to feedback from the SEC. They addressed regulatory concerns and enhancing transparency in their proposed ETF structures.\n\nNate Geraci, the host of ETF Prime, expects other applicants like VanEck, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and others to mirror the move within this week. In case other amendments gush in, the Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 approval could be expedited.\n\nBitwise\u2019s recent amendment, for instance, detailed significant investment commitments. This included a $2.5 million seed investment from Bitwise Investment Manager, LLC. Moreover, expressions of interest from institutions like Pantera Capital Management LP underscore the robust market demand for Ethereum ETFs, despite being non-binding.\n\n3. SEC Chair Gary Gensler Hints At Summer Approval\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2018s public statements have also influenced expectations regarding the approval timeline for Ethereum ETFs. Gensler previously indicated that approvals for such products could be expected \u201cover the course of this summer.\u201d This underscores the SEC\u2019s proactive stance towards embracing innovation while ensuring investor protection.\n\nWhen revising the potential approval date, Balchunas even hinted at an earlier approval. In a post on X, he wrote, \u201cDecent chance they work to declare them effective the next week and get it off their plate before the holiday weekend. Anything is possible but this is our best guess as of now.\u201d\n\nHowever, as of now, the week hasn\u2019t seen such a big leap despite the recent S-1 amendment. Nonetheless, the approval remains imminent as hinted by market analysts.\n\nAlso Read: Hashdex Files 19b-4 For Combined Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "The percent of ETH supply on exchanges has dropped to an eight-year low.\n\nETH rebounded from its decline in the previous trading session.\n\nNot only has Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] price declined in the last few days, but its supply on exchanges has also decreased. This decline aligns with the trend in its Netflow, which has seen a dominance of outflows over the past few days.\n\nWhat percentage of ETH is left on exchanges?\n\nThe Ethereum balance on exchanges has been declining over the past few weeks, with this decline becoming more prominent towards the end of the previous month.\n\nAn analysis of the chart on Glassnode showed that it recently declined to around 10.19%.\n\nAnalysis showed this was the lowest percentage supply on exchanges in about eight years.\n\nA study of the chart indicated that this was the first time since 2016 that the supply dropped to this level. The decline means that addresses holding ETH on exchanges have withdrawn their holdings.\n\nThe decrease in supply over the last few weeks is a positive sign for ETH, suggesting reduced selling pressure and potential accumulation by holders.\n\nMore Ethereum leave exchanges\n\nAn analysis of the exchange flow showed a dominance of outflows in the last few days. As of this writing, the netflow is -1,481, indicating that more Ethereum has left exchanges than has come in.\n\nThis current Netflow trend aligns with the exchange balance, which shows a reduced amount of ETH remaining on all exchanges.\n\nAnalyzing the ETH price trend\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum was trading at around $3,540, with an increase of approximately 1.7%. An analysis of its daily time frame shows an improvement from the previous trading session.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIn the last session, its price dropped to $3,400 after declining by less than 1%. This decline followed another decline in the session before that.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis showed a positive move. The chart indicated that its RSI was now close to the neutral line. This suggests that the bear trend is weakening as of this writing."

        "content": "Altcoin dominance has declined by 15% in the last month.\n\nThe demand for ETH remained significantly low, putting the altcoin at risk of a further price decline.\n\nAltcoin dominance has cratered by double digits in the last month. At 9.88% at press time, it has fallen by 15% in the past 30 days, according to TradingView.\n\nAltcoin dominance refers to the relative market share of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin [BTC]. Its decline means that the total market capitalization held by altcoins was decreasing compared to BTC.\n\nThis may be because investors are moving their funds from altcoins to BTC, which they perceive as a safer and more stable investment asset.\n\nAltcoin dominance waning?\n\nIn times of market consolidation like this, altcoin dominance may decline while Bitcoin dominance increases, as altcoins lose value or fail to attract investors.\n\nHowever, BTC\u2019s dominance has yet to record any significant growth within the one month considered. As of this writing, its value was 55.36%, declining by 1.03% in the last month and 0.69% in the last seven days.\n\nAMBCrypto reported earlier that this gradual decline in BTC dominance is due to the strong resistance the coin faces at the $70,000 price level.\n\nETH remains at risk of decline\n\nAt press time, Ethereum [ETH] traded at $3,561. According to CoinMarketCap, the altcoin\u2019s value has surged by 14% in the past 30 days, despite the general decline in altcoin dominance in the crypto market.\n\nAn assessment of the coin\u2019s performance on a daily chart revealed that it broke below the support level of $3693 on 10 June and has since flipped it into resistance.\n\nEven though it has managed a mere 1% price hike in the last week, ETH\u2019s price has since oscillated within a range, with new resistance formed at the $3693 price level and support found at $3428.\n\nConfirming the general decline for ETH among market participants, its key momentum indicators were positioned below their respective center lines at the time of writing.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 48.60, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 29.59.\n\nThese indicators measure oversold and overbought market conditions by tracking an asset\u2019s price changes.\n\nAt their values as of this writing, they suggested that selling pressure was significantly higher than buying activity.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIf the decline continues, ETH risks falling to $3496.\n\nHowever, if invalidated, its price might rally toward $3658."

        "content": "Thu 20 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nIn the dynamic world of crypto, investor confidence is often measured by their willingness to hold onto their assets through market highs and lows. Recently, Ethereum has signaled a resounding vote of confidence from its community, with a record number of long-term holders. These HODLers play a crucial role in Ethereum\u2019s future!\n\nLong-Term Holders Are Booming on Ethereum!\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, a notable concentration of Ethereum is held for periods ranging from 1 to 3 years! Indicating that much of the Ethereum acquired during the 2021-2022 period is still being held. This trend is reinforced by the decrease in the proportion of crypto held for less than six months, while the share held for more than seven years has increased. Reflecting the stability and faith in the fundamental value of Ethereum and its potential for future growth.\n\nThe Ethereum HODL Waves chart illustrates the distribution of Ethereum held over various periods. This reveals changing trends in the holding behavior of crypto investors. The recent surge in long-term holders suggests a conviction in Ethereum\u2019s long-term value! This, with a significant portion of investors choosing to hold their assets rather than sell in response to market fluctuations.\n\nCrypto \u2013 Ethereum HODLers\n\nThe Influence of HODLers on the Future of Crypto\n\nLong-term Ethereum holders play a crucial role in stabilizing and growing the crypto. By holding their assets, they reduce volatility and create a sense of confidence that attracts new investors. Their long-term vision also encourages the development of innovative projects on the Ethereum blockchain. This, in turn, fosters a richer and more diverse ecosystem.\n\nThis HODLing strategy can positively influence Ethereum\u2019s future, positioning it as a leading digital currency with increased global adoption and usage. However, despite these positive prospects, it is important to note that cryptos remain a high-risk activity. Everything can change at any moment!\n\nThe behavior of long-term Ethereum holders suggests a strong belief in the long-term potential of crypto. Their strategy being beneficial, could be an indicator of Ethereum\u2019s growing maturity as an investment asset.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum market value to real value (MVRV) is outpacing Bitcoin and other assets ahead of the anticipated altcoin season. This metric points to increased positive fundamentals in the market amid the decline in prices sparked by a fall in sentiments. Major drivers of ETH performance are the upcoming Ethereum ETF listings and whale accumulations.\n\nEthereum MVRV Outpaces Bitcoin\n\nEthereum\u2019s MVRV is moving higher than market leader Bitcoin amid a slew of industry factors. New data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows the trend suggests hitting up the ETH market in relation to its fundamentals.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering early alt season. $ETH MVRV is rising faster than BTC MVRV, suggesting the ETH market is heating up relative to its on-chain fundamentals. Given the current ETF situation, this might be an ETH-only season. Historically, when ETH surges, other alts tend to follow.\u201d\n\nThe altcoin season is expected to see a rally in assets but recent events point to an Ethereum-only season according to the data. However, gains will be seen in other altcoins due to the effect of ETH on the market. The asset\u2019s recent surge to $3,700 before a price correction boosted similar sentiments in altcoins and meme tokens.\n\nInstitutional investors increased their appetite for Ethereum after the success of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024. This led to inflows into investment products taking most funds out of the red zone in terms of yearly figures.\n\nETF and Accumulation Drive Sentiments\n\nPotential ETF listings have ignited bullish signals leading to a rise in ETH momentum. The initial approval saw its price soar 22% before falling alongside the market. Bulls project billions of inflows to Ethereum because of its smart contract capabilities and existing market utility.\n\nSimilarly, on-chain data shows the accumulation of the asset despite a price fall. Several analysts have projected the price to tap $4,000 post Ethereum ETF listing coupled with positive macroeconomic factors like cooling inflation and interest rate cuts.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Appeals $4.4M Fine by Canada\u2019s FINTRAC Over AML Violations\n\nDavid Pokima David is a finance news contributor with 4 years of experience in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "XRP holders wonder how SEC will treat Ripple as Ethereum gets free pass - FXStreet",
        "content": "The court decision is a partial summary judgment. The ruling can be appealed once a final judgment is issued or if the judge allows it before then. The case is in a pretrial phase, in which both Ripple and the SEC still have the chance to settle.\n\nThe SEC has stepped up its enforcement actions toward the blockchain and digital assets industry, filing charges against platforms such as Coinbase or Binance for allegedly violating the US Securities law. The SEC claims that the majority of crypto assets are securities and thus subject to strict regulation. While defendants can use parts of Ripple\u2019s ruling in their favor, the SEC can also find reasons in it to keep its current strategy of regulation by enforcement.\n\nThe ruling offers a partial win for both Ripple and the SEC, depending on what one looks at. Ripple gets a big win over the fact that programmatic sales aren\u2019t considered securities, and this could bode well for the broader crypto sector as most of the assets eyed by the SEC\u2019s crackdown are handled by decentralized entities that sold their tokens mostly to retail investors via exchange platforms, experts say. Still, the ruling doesn\u2019t help much to answer the key question of what makes a digital asset a security, so it isn\u2019t clear yet if this lawsuit will set precedent for other open cases that affect dozens of digital assets. Topics such as which is the right degree of decentralization to avoid the \u201csecurity\u201d label or where to draw the line between institutional and programmatic sales are likely to persist.\n\nThe United States Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Ripple and its executives of raising more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered asset offering of the XRP token. While the judge ruled that programmatic sales aren\u2019t considered securities, sales of XRP tokens to institutional investors are indeed investment contracts. In this last case, Ripple did breach the US securities law and will need to keep litigating over the around $729 million it received under written contracts.\n\nIt depends on the transaction, according to a court ruling released on July 14: For institutional investors or over-the-counter sales, XRP is a security. For retail investors who bought the token via programmatic sales on exchanges, on-demand liquidity services and other platforms, XRP is not a security.\n\nOn the contrary, if Ripple closes under $0.4665, the April 19 low, it could invalidate the bullish thesis. XRP could find the next support at the June 7 low of $0.4508.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crossed over the signal line, with green histogram bars flashing above the neutral line, supporting a bullish thesis for XRP. If this upside scenario unfolds, Ripple could rally towards resistance at $0.5326, coinciding with the June 5 high.\n\nXRP gained nearly 1% on Thursday, as seen on the daily chart . The altcoin is trading at $0.4963 on Binance at the time of writing, gaining nearly 1% in the past seven days but losing nearly 8% in the past 30 days.\n\nA big win for Consensys, though questions remain. Does this mean the SEC thinks Consensys\u2019 offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions and/or that ETH itself is not a security? What will Gensler say if now asked? What is the status of MetaMask and staking? This is\u2026\n\nRipple (XRP) holders debate the future of the altcoin on Thursday, which could be closely related to the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) next step following its decision to end the investigation into Ethereum (ETH).\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "content": "The SEC has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, dropping allegations that Ether sales are securities.\n\nConsensys argued that recent ETF approvals implied ETH is a commodity, leading to the investigation\u2019s closure.\n\nThe decision may spark discussions on listing other altcoin ETFs, but Consensys emphasises ongoing challenges in the crypto industry.\n\nIn a major breakthrough for the crypto industry, Consensys, a private blockchain software technology company founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, just announced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into Ethereum.\n\nETHEREUM SURVIVES THE SEC.\n\n\n\nToday we\u2019re happy to announce a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants: the Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\n\n\n\nThis means that the SEC\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nConsensys announced, \u201cthe Enforcement Division of the SEC has notified us that it is closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0\u201d.\n\nRelated: Bloomberg Reports Elon Musk Plans To Turn X Into Next Venmo, Will Crypto Play a Role?\n\nThis includes dropping allegations that sales of Ether are securities \u2013 a long-debated question among the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLubin\u2019s company said this comes after they asked the SEC on 7 June to confirm ETH\u2019s status as a commodity following the recent exchange-traded fund (ETF) decision in the US.\n\nIn late May the regulator gave the green light for the listing of Ether ETFs on several US exchanges. The 19b-4 approval signifies that trading on these exchanges now only requires S-1 approval.\n\nA step many saw as a de facto greenlighting of Ethereum as a commodity.\n\nDecision to Spark More Altcoin ETF Talks\n\nThe SEC dropping the investigation could lead to more talk about altcoin ETFs being listed. Recently, both Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Tether co-founder William Quigley voiced their expectations of several other altcoins fund listings in the near future.\n\nQuigley believes ADA (Cardano) and SOL (Solana) could be next for an ETF, while Garlinghouse also believes an XRP ETF is in the cards.\n\nHowever, Consensys also said in their statement on X that, while great news, the decision to drop the Ethereum investigation is not a miracle cure for all the issues in the crypto industry.\n\nThe closing of the Ethereum investigation is momentous, but it\u2019s not a cure-all for the many blockchain developers, technology providers, and industry participants who have suffered under SEC\u2019s unlawful and aggressive crypto enforcement regime. Consensys Consensys\n\nThe statement added that Consensys would continue the fight, especially regarding the status of crypto wallet MetaMask and swaps and staking within the wallet.\n\nOur fight continues. In our lawsuit, we also seek a declaration that offering the user interface software MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate the securities laws. It should not take a lawsuit to provide the much-needed regulatory clarity to allow an industry that serves\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) June 19, 2024\n\nBackground of SEC Investigation\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, led by Gurbir Grewal, initiated an investigation in March 2023 into Ethereum transactions dating back to 2018.\n\nThe probe came to light when the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub mentioned scrutiny from a \u201cstate authority,\u201d later identified as the SEC.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin NFTs Surpass Ronin with Record $148 Million All-Time Sales in Last 30 Days\n\nIn April, Consensys sued the SEC, seeking confirmation that ETH is not a security. The SEC decided to close the investigation after Consensys argued that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs indicated that ETH is a commodity, not a security."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has permanently closed its Ethereum investigation, which sparked a rally in ETH and altcoins. While the move by the SEC has gained skepticism, especially in the XRP community, does Ether gaining status as a commodity means all proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Cardano, and Polygon are commodities?\n\nSolana, Cardano, Polygon, Other PoS Crypto Are Commodity?\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ending Ethereum investigation sparked speculation that Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and other proof-of-stake (PoS) could also be commodities. Also, Ether has leaped over Bitcoin and XRP in terms of gaining regulatory clarity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPopular XRP sleuth Mr. Huber asked former SEC securities lawyer Marc Fagel whether the SEC now considering Ethereum as a commodity means anything for proof of stake crypto projects. The latest move by the SEC brings major PoS crypto such as Solana, Cardano, and Polygon in the spotlight. The SEC has alleged Solana, Cardano, and Polygon as securities in Binance, Coinbase, and other lawsuits.\n\nI have no visibility into their thinking but, no, I wouldn\u2019t make that leap. I don\u2019t know what evidence (or lack of such) led the SEC to close the investigation, but I assume the prevalence of serious defenses (not present for other crypto) was a big factor. \u2014 Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 19, 2024\n\nAlexander Grieve, government affairs lead at Paradigm, said that it is relatively unusual for the SEC to highlight a company in response to a closure of an investigation. The SEC is \u201cunder no obligation to do so.\u201d Also, Ethereum Foundation was part of the investigation, but it didn\u2019t receive any letter.\n\nMarc Fagel agreed that it\u2019s highly unusual to send a closing letter to one party if something was ongoing as to another party in an investigation.\n\nAlso Read: XRP, Cardano, & 7 Other Communities Must Watch This Key Move By Binance\n\nWill Consensys Drop Lawsuit Against SEC?\n\nConsensys revealed that the SEC Enforcement Division has closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0, as per a letter send by SEC Assistant Director Kristin M. Pauley on June 18. The company claimed it\u2019s a major win for Ethereum developers, technology providers, and industry participants.\n\nThe move comes in response to a letter sent by Consensys seeking confirmation from the SEC. The May ETH ETF approvals by the SEC were largely a result of ETH\u2019s status as a commodity.\n\nConsensys said it will continue to challenge the SEC in the lawsuit. The company seeks a declaration from the SEC that offering the user interface software MetaMask Swaps and Staking does not violate the securities laws.\n\nAlso Read: The Sandbox Expands Memecoin Chest With DOGE, PEPE, SHIB Purchase\n\nVarinder Singh Varinder has 10 years of experience in the Fintech sector, with over 5 years dedicated to blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developments.

        "content": "Ethereum price climbed higher above $3,500 but struggled near $3,580. ETH must clear the $3,650 resistance to move further into a positive zone.\n\nEthereum is consolidating gains below the $3,650 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a short-term rising channel forming with resistance near $3,585 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,600 and $3,650 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Consolidates\n\nEthereum price started a decent increase from the $3,350 support zone. ETH formed a base and climbed above the $3,450 and $3,500 resistance levels. It even outperformed Bitcoin and broke the $3,550 resistance.\n\nThe bears are now active below the $3,600 level. A high was formed at $3,586 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $3,550 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,350 swing low to the $3,586 high.\n\nEthereum is still trading above $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with resistance near $3,585 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3,580 level or the channel zone. The first major resistance is near the $3,620 level. The main resistance sits at $3,650. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might send the price higher.\n\nThe next key resistance sits at $3,720, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,750 level. A clear move above the $3,750 level might send Ether toward the $3,880 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $4,000 resistance zone in the coming days.\n\nAnother Drop In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,520 and the channel trend line. The first major support is $3,500.\n\nA clear move below the $3,500 support might push the price toward $3,465 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,350 swing low to the $3,586 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,400 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,500\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,600"
