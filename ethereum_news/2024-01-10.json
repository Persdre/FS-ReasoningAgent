        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are three different catalysts that have the potential to send Ethereum higher in 2024.\n\nAmid the current crypto market rally led by Bitcoin, there's one crypto that seems to be getting completely overlooked: Ethereum (ETH 0.07%). That's somewhat surprising, given that Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with an enormous $290 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, the hype around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has focused investor attention squarely on Bitcoin. At the same time, a number of direct Ethereum rivals skyrocketed to triple-digit percentage gains last year, and have become the new darlings of crypto investors looking for maximum upside. But there are several reasons Ethereum might be undervalued at its current price of about $2,400.\n\nEthereum vs. the wannabe Ethereums\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum was the talk of the crypto industry. It had just pulled off The Merge, which fundamentally transformed its blockchain to make it faster, cheaper, easier to use, and much more energy efficient. The hype around Ethereum grew to the point where some investors even thought that Ethereum might eventually surpass Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nBut then came 2023. All of a sudden, rival blockchains like Solana started gaining traction with investors. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year. Avalanche, another Ethereum rival, was up nearly 200% for the year. By way of comparison, Ethereum was up 90%, and seemed to be losing the attention of investors.\n\nSo the big question is whether Ethereum is still best-in-class. If you think that the so-called Ethereum killers are just a bunch of Ethereum wannabes with no long-term staying power, then Ethereum could be highly undervalued at its current price. But if you think that Ethereum's long reign as the top Layer-1 blockchain network in the world is coming to an end, then it's a completely different story.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF incoming?\n\nRight now, the imminent arrival of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market is getting all the headlines. But, according to a growing number of crypto investors, a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming soon. And that means that Ethereum could soon get the same type of boost Bitcoin is getting right now.\n\nCertainly, the underlying logic makes sense. Wall Street is looking for more reliable ways to invest in crypto, and has apparently determined that the ETF investment product is the best way to achieve this. Once it can show that a spot Bitcoin ETF is successful, then it's time to crank up this formula for every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nGiven Ethereum's market heft -- it now accounts for about 17% of the market value of the entire crypto market, second only to Bitcoin -- it would only make sense that Ethereum would be next in line for a spot ETF. And, indeed, there is already an application in the works for just such a product. In September, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. If the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to approve this (admittedly, a big \"if\"), it could result in billions of dollars flowing into Ethereum, pushing up its price.\n\nA sexy new upgrade\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Ethereum's next big upgrade. Ethereum recently published its strategic roadmap for 2024, and one item on the roadmap that caught the attention of investors was something called EIP-4844 (\"Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844\"). Basically, this is a proposed technical change that would enable the processing of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to become much faster and more efficient.\n\nI know, I know. You're probably rolling your eyes right now. What a bunch of blockchain babble, right? But consider that EIP-4844 got J.P. Morgan really excited. In a research note to clients, JPMorgan specifically referred to EIP-4844 as a key reason it thinks Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024. That's because this major technical change would make it theoretically possible for the Ethereum blockchain to handle 100,000 transactions per second, up from about a dozen or so now. With that type of speed, Ethereum would basically be unstoppable.\n\nHow much higher can Ethereum go?\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum needs to convince investors that it is still the preeminent Layer-1 blockchain network. So keep an eye on how Ethereum deals with the growing threat from the likes of Solana. As long as investors buy into the idea that Solana is a faster and more cost-efficient version of Ethereum, it's hard to see Ethereum skyrocketing in price.\n\nWith that in mind, it's certainly possible to find a number of bullish Ethereum price predictions for 2024. Some crypto traders think that Ethereum could double, triple, or even quadruple in value. I may not be as bullish on Ethereum, but I'm certainly open to the idea that Ethereum could surprise a lot of people in 2024."

        "title": "Ether prices spike on hopes of an ETF \u2014 but the SEC signals that's less clear cut than bitcoin - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.BF= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler fired warning shots to the crypto industry, casting doubt over whether digital coin ether would follow next in the footsteps of bitcoin to receive approval for an exchange-traded fund. After the bitcoin ETF approval, prices for ether \u2014 the token linked with Ethereum \u2014 spiked to their highest level since May 2022. That was because investors are betting on an ether \u2014 or ETH \u2014 ETF to be rubberstamped by the SEC next. The agency is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC has long been an opponent of cryptocurrencies, and its bitcoin ETF approval in no way changed its stance in a big way. After the ETF decision, Gensler issued a statement in which he called bitcoin \"speculative\" and said it could be used for \"illicit\" purposes. One comment poured cold water over hopes of an ETH ETF. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\" Gensler said Wednesday after the SEC decision on the ETFs.\n\nCrypto as commodities or securities?\n\nA long-running debate in the U.S. is over whether cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or as commodities. Key to Gensler's comments was his reference that bitcoin's status as a \"non-security commodity\" was one of the reasons why the SEC was comfortable approving the ETF. Gensler made clear that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\" in the SEC's view. This complicates matters for an ETH ETF. \"One distinction which I think people have to look at which is that bitcoin clearly has been bucketed as a commodity, Ethereum, there's still some question. Is it a security? Is it a commodity? And I think until that's resolved, it cannot be look at exactly like the bitcoin product, in terms of how do you structure and ETF around it,\" Bill Tai, chairperson of Aktai, told CNBC in an interview at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz. Tai said that approving an ETH ETF is \"not as clear cut\" as was the case of bitcoin. \"I do think that it's not out of the range of possibility, but there are additional factors to consider around that one because of its classification,\" Tai said. Securities and commodities are regulated under different laws and by different agencies.\n\nWill an ETH ETF happen this year?\n\nCommentators are split on when an ETH ETF may come to the market. Some, like Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Nexo, think it will happen this year. \"I'd watch what the SEC does and not what it says, because it wasn't long ago that the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF seemed like a distant dream. Things move very fast in crypto and investors are front-running what they believe to be the next big spot ETF approval,\" Trenchev told CNBC by email. \"You'd have to say now that bitcoin has knocked down the door it's only a matter of when not if others will follow \u2014 most likely in 2024 \u2014 and ETH is definitely the leader of the pack.\" Christopher Giancarlo, co-founder of the digital dollar project and former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, oversaw the introduction of bitcoin futures in 2017. He said that, in his experience at the regulator, the approval of one product opens the doors for others. \"Once we greenlighted bitcoin futures, there as a tremendous movement in the CFTC jurisdiction area for greenlighting ethereum futures and that did come 18 months later,\" Giancarlo told CNBC on Thursday. He added that he would be \"shocked\" if there weren't growing demand for an ether ETF. \"The SEC's going to have deal with the growing demand for that product,\" Giancarlo added. Others are a little more skeptical that the SEC could approve an ETH ETF in the short term.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Two Powerful Blockchain Platforms of the Future: Ethereum and Solana - Paxos",
        "content": "Blockchain, once overlooked in the shadow of cryptocurrency, is now a powerhouse player in its own right with implications far beyond the financial sector. From improving supply chain integrity to facilitating transactions for a wide range of digital assets, its use cases are vast and varied.\n\nBut what lies at the heart of this innovative technology, and how can it be harnessed? It is helpful for enterprises across many industries to understand the fundamentals of blockchain and how key platforms like Ethereum and Solana are leading the charge in this technological revolution.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is digital ledger technology that documents transactions across a network of computers. It can log and track everything from cryptocurrency payments to real-world assets to legal agreements.\n\nBlockchain technology is renowned for its security and immutability. The technology\u2019s name stems from the fact that it\u2019s comprised of a series of \u201cblocks,\u201d with each containing transaction data, a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Every transaction is linked in a \u201cchain\u201d and distributed across numerous nodes.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there\u2019s little risk of manipulation from entities like governments or financial institutions. In fact, a blockchain\u2019s structure makes it nearly impossible to retroactively alter any single record without changing all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers transparency and decentralization, making it an attractive option for transactional applications\u2014among them, money movement, supply chain management and even digital identity verification.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nWithin blockchain technology, there are many different blockchain platforms. Two of the most prominent blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Solana, each with unique features and capabilities.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum, launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced the concept of \u201c smart contracts ,\u201d or self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The latest iteration of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism\u2014essentially, th e process by which validators create new blocks. ( Learn more about consensus mechanisms and how they work here .)\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a newer blockchain platform that launched to the public in 2020. It\u2019s known for speed and efficiency. It employs a unique hybrid consensus model, combining proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS). This enables it to process transactions rapidly and with lower fees compared to Ethereum. As such, Solana is an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and other applications requiring quick transaction times.\n\nEthereum and Solana have gained popularity because they offer solutions to common pain points related to scalability, speed and cost. These platforms have also sparked an entire ecosystem of subsequent innovation: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has given rise to decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe future of finance: instant transfers and more\n\nImagine a world where international suppliers are paid the moment goods are shipped, employees receive compensation in real-time and complex financial transactions are settled instantly. This immediacy not only streamlines business operations, but also opens doors to new financial strategies like dynamic pricing. The ripple effects of such capabilities include more agile, responsive and competitive businesses and a transformation of the way global commerce operates.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum and Solana have the potential to make such hypotheticals into realities. With their ability to power instant, 24/7 financial transactions across borders, blockchains may be particularly attractive to enterprises operating in multiple countries or those engaging in high-volume trade, not to mention the implications for sectors like e-commerce and digital supply chain management.\n\nBlockchain technology is evolving rapidly. Many enterprises need a hand when it comes to adopting it and maximizing its potential and a trusted partner can help you seamlessly integrate blockchain into existing operations.\n\nBlockchain is transforming the way we think about money, assets and transactions and is paving the way for new business models and strategies. With the right partners to help you navigate and implement blockchain systems, your business will be well-positioned to stay a step ahead in the digital finance era."

BlackRock\u2019s deadline is in August, however if the SEC does approve, it could approve all applicants like it did for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nPrior to the SEC's spot Bitcoin approval, Valkyrie Funds' chief investment officer Steven McClurg said he wouldn't be surprised if spot Ether and XRP ETFs come to market after Bitcoin. Several major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs. The SEC must make decisions on these applications by various dates ranging from May 23 to August 7.\n\nFollowing the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) gained 8.5% over the past 24 hours, and rallied over 15% in the past week, breaking above the $2.5K level, as investors speculate on the potential of a spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Are Surging Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals are just one catalyst taking these three tokens higher today.\n\nThe entire crypto world has been shaken, in a positive way, by recent developments around yesterday's approval of certain exchange-traded products. For Bitcoin Cash (BCH -3.17%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -2.40%), and Litecoin (LTC 0.29%), broadly positive sectorwide sentiment appears to be a key driver behind these tokens' impressive moves higher. As of 2 p.m. ET, these three tokens have rocketed 13.9%, 34.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe approvals of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undoubtedly led to significant interest across the cryptocurrency sector today. Much of today's increase can be attributed to expectations that institutional capital will flow into this sector in dramatic fashion. In fact, projections from some analysts peg the impact of these approvals at around $100 billion. That's a win not only for Bitcoin, but for investors considering this entire space, as it legitimizes crypto for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nLet's dive into what's behind the specific moves in these three cryptos today, over and above the obviously bullish headline news dominating the market right now.\n\nWhy are these three tokens surging today?\n\nFor Bitcoin Cash, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system tied closely to Bitcoin, today's news is obviously a net positive for this network. However, there are other key drivers supporting Bitcoin Cash's recent performance. News that cryptocurrency payments have surged to a record high in 2024 is very bullish for the likes of Bitcoin cash and other payments-focused cryptocurrencies. A report on Jan. 10 cited that nearly 1.3 million Bitcoin transactions were reportedly processed in 2023 alone, bringing the total number of Bitcoin transactions to more than 4 million. For those bullish on crypto as a payments facilitation technology, this is a strong catalyst to consider for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nFor Ethereum classic, the proof-of-work fork of the Ethereum blockchain, excitement around the potential approval for spot Ethereum ETF approvals appears to be driving interest in this adjacent token. Essentially, investors and traders appear to be speculating on a potential hard fork for Ethereum Classic, which would better align the network with Ethereum's, and improve its outlook (if Ethereum surges as a result of ETF approvals, one could argue Ethereum Classic could be due for a rally as well). Of course, such a substantial move of more than 30% may be overdone, so this will certainly be a token traders focus in on in the coming days.\n\nLitecoin's more muted rise today appears to be tied more to sector-specific tailwinds than anything else. Largely viewed as a Bitcoin and Ethereum alternative, this is a token that typically rides the tides higher and lower over specific time frames. Right now, there's a rising tide lifting most boats in this sector, and Litecoin investors are certainly pleased to see momentum taking this token higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nIs this momentum sustainable?\n\nUltimately, we'll have to see if these spot ETF approvals are a \"sell the news\" event, or a strong catalyst that puts a floor beneath crypto prices for the foreseeable future. In many respects, we won't know which outcome will materialize until after the fact. Thus, some amount of hesitation may lead to a waiting period for certain long-term investors, and could present an opportunity for buyers considering these tokens to jump in and ride momentum higher over the medium term.\n\nOverall, I think yesterday's spot ETF approvals are a bullish catalyst for the sector. For one, these approvals legitimize crypto as an asset class institutional investors can buy into. Another key factor driving sectorwide interest is the flurry of institutional capital expected for large-cap cryptos. Accordingly, for those seeking exposure to these trends, and looking for less-visible (and potentially higher-upside) ways to play crypto, these three tokens will likely continue to be in focus in the coming weeks."

        "content": "Ethereum price briefly broke past the $2,400 mark on Jan. 10, up 10% within the weekly time frame, ahead of the much-anticipated Bitcoin ETF Approval.\n\nThe crypto market experienced widespread volatility on Jan 9 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced false Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approval in a now-denounced post on X.\n\nDespite the raging controversy, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price has maintained a steady uptrend, trading as high as $2,440 on Jan. 10.\n\nEthereum vs Bitcoin: Crypto derivatives traders are betting bigger on ETH\n\nBetween Jan. 7 and Jan. 10, Ethereum\u2019s 11% price growth performance has dwarfed Bitcoin\u2019s 4%. Interestingly, vital derivative market metrics now suggest that ETH price could further outperform BTC if the SEC issues a timely positive verdict on Bitcoin Spot ETFs.\n\nFirstly, the funding rate represents the interest paid by bullish traders to inverse traders to keep their LONG futures contract positions open. As of morning trading hours Eastern time on Jan. 10, ETH currently has a Funding rate of 0.014%, which marginally exceeds currently exceeds BTC\u2019s 0.12%\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs Bitcoin (BTC) Funding Rate | Source: Coinglass\n\nPut concisely, a higher positive funding rate in Ethereum than in Bitcoin implies increased demand for long positions in the ETH derivatives market, potentially reflecting a more optimistic sentiment.\n\nIn further confirmation that Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin, the open interest dynamics have also flashed similar signals since the week\u2019s turn.\n\nYou might also like: Bloomberg ETF analyst: Bitcoin ETF to be approved today\n\nETH open interest growth has outpaced BTC\n\nETH Open Interest has increased by 14.6% from $3.71 billion at close on Jan. 7 to $4.57 billion at the time of writing on Jan 10. Meanwhile, BTC open interest has witnessed only a 5% boost, from $6.4 billion to $7.3 billion during this period.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nOpen interest represents the dollar value of all active futures contracts for a specific cryptocurrency. An increase in open interest implies more new entrants are bringing fresh capital than those closing out their positions.\n\nThe chart above clearly illustrates that the percentage increase in ETH has outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s open interest amid intense speculation on the spot BTC ETF verdict. This affirms that crypto traders are betting on Ethereum to deliver larger price gains in the days ahead.\n\nWill ETH reach $3,000 after BTC ETF approval?\n\nDespite Bitcoin pulling more media traction, the current ETH Funding rate and Open Interest trends imply that crypto traders anticipate higher price gains in Ethereum after a positive ETF verdict. If this scenario continues, ETH\u2019s price will likely reclaim the $2,500 territory.\n\nHowever, IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money around price (IOMAP) data, which groups the current ETH holders by their historical entry points, shows a major resistance sell-wall around the $2,475 range.\n\nThe IOMAP depicts that 567,150 addresses have acquired 398,810 ETH at the average price of $2,475.\n\nGiven that this cluster of holders has been holding at a loss for nearly two years, they could rapidly book profits as ETH price approaches their break-even point again.\n\nBut if the derivative traders continue doubling their bullish positions as depicted by the elevated ETH funding rates, Ethereum\u2019s price could break above $2,500 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, Jan. 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConversely, if a material market even sends ETH price into a down trend, the $2,200 support level could be crucial.\n\nAs seen above, the 2.85 million addresses that had acquired 7.7 million ETH coins at the minimum price of $2,220 could mount a formidable buy-wall to avert a prolonged Ethereum price downswing."

        "content": "Fake Airdrop for Ethereum, Solana, Tron Users Carried out by Scammers\n\nHackers target the Ethereum, Solana, and Tron crypto communities by enticing them with a fake airdrop scheme.\n\nWallet drainers, previously fixated on executing crypto scams via EVM chains, have now expanded their horizons to target Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities.\n\nThis shift marks a concerning trend as these scammers venture into well-established crypto groups.\n\nPhishing Scams via Fake Airdrops\n\nThe modus operandi involves enticing crypto enthusiasts through fraudulent airdrops. The scammers create a webpage where users can supposedly claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThese scams are labeled an \"exclusive opportunity\" for the community, urging individuals to link their primary wallets for access. Scam Sniffer highlights that these fraudsters can drain various crypto wallets using this deceptive webpage.\n\nAccording to CoinGape, this development is particularly problematic given the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, alongside Solana and Tron.\n\nThe lure of substantial crypto rewards might mislead investors, potentially resulting in significant losses amounting to millions or even billions in digital assets due to these wallet drainer scams.\n\nIdentifying and Avoiding Crypto Scams\n\nWhile scammers occasionally upgrade their strategies, identifying potential scams can still be achieved through simple checks.\n\nAccording to Blockworks, Scam Sniffer's shared snapshot reveals grammatical errors on the fraudulent airdrop webpage, serving as a red flag for cautious users. However, it's crucial to remain vigilant as scammers adapt and refine their tactics over time.\n\nTo stay secure, always verify the source of such links. If a reputable entity is not the source of the airdrop updates, it is advisable to steer clear of such offerings.\n\nFurthermore, heightened caution is necessary, considering recent incidents where hackers compromised verified X accounts of well-known companies like Certik and Mandiant to promote crypto scams.\n\nEarlier this month, Certik experienced a similar attack on its X account, followed by Mandiant on January 4, 2024, raising concerns about the security of even the most established platforms.\n\nPhoto: Nahel Abdul Hadi / Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

        "content": "Ethereum Classic price is continuously going up for the past few hours and is now floating around $28, at the time of writing. It recorded more than 30% gains in the last 24 hours with almost 35% weekly and monthly gains.\n\nThe approval news of the first Bitcoin spot ETF is spreading like wildfire in the crypto industry. And, it is already showing strong signs of impact on all major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum Classic. Let us learn more about what is happening in the industry and why ETC is going up, in the present article.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approved, Finally\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved by the US SEC on 10 January, 2024. Entire crypto industry has been waiting for this news for several months. And, now that it is finally approved, several altcoins and Bitcoin are following an uptrend.\n\nThe anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF approval has itself brought considerable returns for Bitcoin since the past couple of months. From around $26,600 in October, 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value breached the $45,000 mark as soon as we entered January, 2024.\n\nWhile one of the strong reasons behind this price rally was the awaiting Bitcoin spot ETF approval, another reason is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAs the US SEC final judgment approached, a fake post was posted from the official X account. This caused a sharp price spike in the BTC chart. However, Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC clarified that the US SEC account was hacked and the ETF approval post was posted by unauthorized individuals. As Gary Gensler stated that the post was fake, the BTC price dropped around 5% within a couple of hours.\n\nHowever, the US SEC finally approved the Bitcoin spot ETF application of Grayscale Investments. As a result, several altcoins like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Pepe Coin, and others are rising in value.\n\nEthereum Hits 20-Month High\n\nEthereum Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nSurprisingly, the Bitcoin spot ETF approval has more impact on altcoins when compared to Bitcoin. The BTC price rose slightly and briefly touched the $47,000 mark whereas the Ether price increased by around 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading above $2,600, at the time of writing.\n\nEthereum has hit its 20-month high as the last time it traded above $2,600 was in May, 2022. At present, Ethereum price is recording 18% weekly gains and 16% monthly gains. And, the ETH price is expected to rise further.\n\nMost of the investors believe that Ethereum is the next best cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Because of its sophisticated technology and network upgrades Ethereum stands out from the rest of the cryptocurrencies. And, investors don\u2019t hesitate when it comes to Ethereum in the market conditions like present.\n\nEthereum Classic to Reach the $30 Mark\n\nEthereum Classic Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nThe clear winner among all the altcoins is Ethereum Classic. The ETC price rose by 34% in the last 24 hours and is showing no signs of slowing down with its increasing trading volume. It is currently trading at around $28 and is just $2 away from reaching the $30 mark.\n\nSo far, Ethereum Classic is one of the top performing altcoins in the crypto industry after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval surfaced. In addition to the price, its trading volume is soaring by 276%, standing at $1.8 billion and implying that the price could surge further. Its market capitalization also surged by 34% and crossed the $4 billion mark today.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event are not only pushing the BTC price but also the prices of altcoins."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC), the original version of Ethereum that split from the main network in 2016, has blasted higher by 50% in the last 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe coin, which ranks as the 21st largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has outperformed its more popular sibling, Ethereum (ETH), which gained only 11.24% in the same period.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETC was up 50% in the last 24 hours to $31.16, gaining 55% in the last seven days.\n\nETC appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the crypto market's positive sentiment following the approval of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, Ethereum Classic blasted off following the Bitcoin ETF announcement, surpassing $26 for the first time since October 2022.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #EthereumClassic has blasted off following the #BitcoinETF announcement, reaching above $26 for the first time since October, 2022.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe red-hot Ordinal Inscription protocol continues to draw new developers who hope to put their stamp on the Bitcoin blockchain. The latest is Bitfinity, which aims to integrate its Ethereum Virtual Machine with Bitcoin. The grand plan, Bitfinity said on Thursday, is to support Bitcoin-enabled DeFi services using a sidechain on the Internet Computer.\n\nTo achieve this, Bitfinity has raised $7 million in new funding, led by San Francisco-based investment firm Polychain Capital and Connecticut-based ParaFi Capital.\n\n\u201cAs the demand to integrate Bitcoin increases, we believe Bitfinity\u2019s EVM opens up the Bitcoin ecosystem to novel use cases and applications,\u201d ParaFi Capital managing partner Ben Forman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to support the entire Bitfinity team on their mission to enhance Bitcoin utility.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2021 by the Dfinity Foundation, Internet Computer (ICP) is an advanced blockchain-based computing system housed in a network of machines distributed worldwide. Internet Computer uses a unique consensus model called proof-of-useful-work, which aims to be more efficient than proof-of-work yet more secure than proof-of-stake models.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitfinity says smart contracts can hold and transfer Bitcoin and Ordinal assets on-chain using the Internet Computer's threshold signature scheme, known as Chain-Key.\n\nBitfinity\u2019s EVM scheme is not the first time the ICP network has been used to handle Ordinal inscriptions. In November, Ordinals Marketplace Bioniq launched on the Internet Computer.\n\nBitfinity founder Max Chamberlin said the project is not meant to supplant Bitcoin but to show that Ethereum and Bitcoin devotees are not that different.\n\n\u201cJustin Drake, an Ethereum researcher, once quipped, \u2018Ethereum is Bitcoin,\u2019 Bitfinity founder Max Chamberlin told Decrypt. \u201cIn the spirit of those words, I believe we are all Bitcoiners. Bitfinity is for everyone, and though some Bitcoin purists might shudder at the thought, they weren\u2019t supportive of Ordinals or BRC-20 tokens anyway, and those took off to dizzying heights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Bitfinity may offer lower cost and faster speeds, the company will still have to convince Bitcoin purists and Ordinal enthusiasts to use their platform instead of minting on the blockchain directly.\n\n\u201cBitfinity doesn't change the fact that Ordinals are directly inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain, and as such, doesn\u2019t change the core ethos of on-chain digital assets,\" Chamberlin said. \u201cRather, it just makes it cheaper to use them.\u201d\n\nSince its launch last year, over 50 million Ordinal inscriptions have been minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the most recent inscriptions was of a letter from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler announcing the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn addition to Ordinals, Bitfinity said future Bitcoin plans include BRC-20 tokens in its protocol. The BRC-20 standard allows users to create meme-coins on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cIf the lessons learned from Ethereum are anything to go by, many users will prefer a low-cost side-chain or L2 to run their transactions,\u201d Chamberlin concluded. \u201cSo perhaps we could rejoin, in the spirit of Justin Drake, and declare\u2014far from Ethereum being Bitcoin\u2014Bitcoin is actually Ethereum through L2s like Bitfinity and much more beyond that.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to correct the type of consensus algorithm used by Internet Computer."

        "content": "Ether has risen as much as 9% in the last 24 hours on expectations that a spot Ethereum ETF will get approved next.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday, and now optimism about the prospects of a spot Ethereum ETF approval is driving a rally in ETH prices.\n\nETH prices were up about as much as 9% over the last 24 hours before settling slightly. As with Bitcoin, futures ETF products based on Ethereum have already been approved and launched, while applications for spot ETF investments are awaiting a decision by the SEC.\n\n\u201cETH\u2019s recent outperformance relative to BTC is a nod to the market\u2019s anticipation of a spot ETF approval,\u201d Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian digital asset management firm 3iQ, told Unchained in an email.\n\nRead more: Why Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are (But Mostly Aren\u2019t) a Big Deal for Crypto\n\nBitcoin was roughly flat over the last 24 hours after gaining as much as 6%, but optimism about a spot Bitcoin ETF has been driving prices up higher for some time now, with Bitcoin rising more than 80% since BlackRock and Fidelity first stoked enthusiasm last June by filing their ETF applications. Overall, Bitcoin has gained about 174% over the last year, compared to Ethereum\u2019s gain of about 99%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAccording to analysts, this disparity is largely due to the fact that the narrative driving Bitcoin\u2019s rally \u2014 optimism around the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals\u2014 directly relates to Bitcoin rather than crypto as a whole. But now that attention is shifting to ETH ETF approvals, will ETH experience the same type of huge rally?\n\n\u201cI would say that it\u2019s not going to be the exact same because Bitcoin\u2019s qualities are more fundamentally oriented towards gold where it is secure, it is a stored value. It is a money,\u201d said Connors., He later noted that Ethereum is more of a decentralized, dynamic platform than Bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAfter approving a slate of Ethereum futures-based ETFs late last year, the SEC now has until May to decide on spot ETFs, including offerings from VanEck, ARK Invest 21Shares, and BlackRock.\n\n\u201cInvestors are waiting for the spot ETFs for Ethereum exposure,\u201d said Neena Mishra, ETF research director at Zacks Investment Research, during a call with Unchained. \u201cEthereum futures ETFs made their debut late last year, and we\u2019ve seen almost no interest from investors. That was not a surprise because investors want the real thing.\u201d\n\nRead more: Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Sparks Altcoin Rally\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that Bitcoin is the only digital asset that isn\u2019t a security, which could make it harder for Ethereum to get approved. But Mishra doesn\u2019t think that stance will stand in the way of spot ether ETF approvals since the futures-based ETFs positioned Ethereum as a commodity. Gensler was also hesitant about the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as evidenced when he posted an X thread warning about the risks of crypto investments earlier this week, but the approvals still happened.\n\n\u201cI see very low chances of [the SEC] not approving the spot Ethereum ETFs,\u201d Mishra noted."

        "content": "Ethereum Classic price formed a double-top reversal pattern that hints at a 21% decline.\n\nPrice indicators highlight the potential of the pattern failing due to bullish broader market cues.\n\nThe anticipated spot Bitcoin ETF approvals will likely have a bullish impact on altcoins, benefiting ETC.\n\nEthereum Classic price was seemingly adhering to the micro bearish reversal pattern, which failed despite the recent correction in the crypto market. The short-term outlook ahead of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval is now looking bullish as ETC is bouncing back from the crucial support of $19.33.\n\nEthereum Classic price notes a bearish reversal pattern\n\nEthereum Classic price on the 4-hour scale invalidates the double-top bearish reversal pattern that has been observed in the past four weeks. This pattern consists of two peaks or tops of nearly identical height positioned closely together, with a trough in between. It suggests a possible shift in market direction.\n\nThe potential trend reversal is indicated by the price encountering a resistance level on two separate occasions without successfully surpassing it. This is often interpreted as a sign to consider selling or initiating short positions as further declines in the market.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum Classic, this double top was formed at $23.42, with the neckline or support level of the pattern being marked at $19.33. This is also the breakout level, and an extended decline below this line would confirm the bearish reversal pattern. Furthermore, a successful pattern would only be observed when ETC falls to the target price of $15.24, which, according to the pattern, would register a 21% decline on the 4-hour chart.\n\nHowever, Ethereum Classic price took the other route and, instead of falling through the neckline, bounced off it to note minor recovery, trading at $19.90 at the time of writing. Although this does not rule out the potential for decline, the price indicators do suggest invalidation of the pattern is likely, too.\n\nETC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator are giving out mixed signals, with the former still sitting in the bearish zone and the latter noting a bullish crossover.\n\nEthereum Classic RSI and MACD\n\nIf Ethereum Classic price continues the current path and broader market bullish cues kick in, ETC could move sideways or upwards beyond $20 and invalidate the bearish pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Ethereum namesake falls through the neckline and falls below $19, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, and the reversal pattern could be deemed mildly successful since absolute success would warrant a 21% correction."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, currently shows a lack of bullish momentum contrary to the generally bullish sentiment around Bitcoin spot ETFs. The ETH price has been resonating between the $2400 and $2140 horizontal levels for the past five weeks, with the overhead supply preventing the buyers from a higher rally. Will potential approval from the US SEC bolster the Ether price to escape this uncertainty?\n\n$2400 Breakout Will Trigger a Direction Rally\n\nA steep support trendline leads to the current recovery trend in the ETH price.\n\nA potential recovery may face new resistances at $2680 and $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $20.8 Billion, indicating a 68% gain.\n\nAn ascending trendline in the daily time frame chart shows the Ethereum price recovery is intact and the current sideways trend is likely a post-rally consolidation to recuperate the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the Ethereum whales have accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of Ether despite its underperformance relative to Bitcoin. A recent tweet from renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals that the Ethereum smart money has significantly increased its holdings by accumulating more than 410,000 ETH tokens during the past month(December).\n\nThis accumulation amid the crypto market\u2019s progress towards the first spot Bitcoin ETF hints the ETH may also witness a major impact of US SEC approval as the potential for spot Ethereum ETF will also accelerate.\n\nBy press time, the ETH price shows a 3.77% jump and teases a bullish breakout from the $2400 resistance level. If buyers succeed in closing a daily candle above this barrier, it could lay a solid foundation for additional upward movement.\n\nSuch a breakout could potentially result in a 10% rise in ETH, setting its next target at around $2,680. Following this, a prolonged recovery could target the $3,000 and $3280 mark.\n\nThis Support Prevents ETH From Major Correction\n\nOver the past two months, the ETH price has been receiving dynamic support from an ascending trendline. The coin price rebounded several times from this support indicating the buyers are actively accumulating at a dip which is a key sign of sustainable recovery. Thus, it also indicates losing this support could intensify selling pressure and trigger a new correction in this asset.\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator suggests the bullish momentum is strengthening.\n\nAverage Directional Index: A low value of ADX(15%) hints the ongoing consolidation has managed to offer buyers sufficient break to kickstart a new rally.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

The ETC price is up by a staggering 32% trading at $27.74 with a market cap of $4.05 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic Trading Volumes\n\nIn the wake of the Bitcoin ETF announcement, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has experienced a significant surge, surpassing the $26 mark for the first time since October 2022. The surge in trading volume suggests substantial interest from major traders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the notable price movement, the sentiment surrounding Ethereum Classic remains neutral at present, as indicated by on-chain data provided by Santiment. Investors are closely monitoring the developments in the Ethereum Classic market following the recent Bitcoin-related news.\n\nThe ETC Price Bullish Breakout\n\nIn the weekly chart analysis, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has shown a departure from the lower high formation that characterized the previous bearish trend until 2022. After a year-long consolidation range throughout 2023, ETC struggled to surpass the resistance at $23. A recent resurgence, however, has resulted in a bullish breakout from the consolidation range, signaling a notable trend reversal for Ethereum Classic. This breakout is seen as a significant entry point for traders on the sidelines. The heightened market activity has contributed to a remarkable 250% increase in the 24-hour trading volume, supporting the sharp upward movement and hinting at the potential continuation of an uptrend. Currently trading at $28.43, Ethereum Classic has formed a bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart. The breakthrough above the $25 barrier positions Ethereum Classic for a sustained bullish rally. The rising sentiment in the market is fostering increased risk appetite among investors, contributing to the broader uptrend in the altcoin market. Under favorable market conditions, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price trajectory may lead to a breakout beyond multiple resistance levels, with a potential target of $40 on the horizon. However, should ETC struggle to maintain its momentum, a retest of the $25 level could be in the cards. Traders and investors are closely monitoring market dynamics to gauge the sustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s current bullish momentum.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) has emerged as a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market, registering an impressive 34% surge within the past 24 hours. This surge not only surpasses the performance of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also positions Ethereum Classic as the top performer among the 100 leading cryptocurrencies by market cap presently.\n\nRemarkable Rally of Ethereum Classic\n\nWhile Bitcoin recorded a modest 1% increase and Ethereum observed a substantial rise of over 9% in the last 24 hours, ETC\u2019s surge has garnered significant attention. This noteworthy upward movement in price has elevated ETC to a prominent position. It has further established it as the leading performer among the top 100.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing, triggered by the announcement of a Bitcoin ETF, has propelled its value beyond the $26 mark for the first time since October 2022. The accompanying surge in trading volume indicates considerable interest from major traders.\n\nAlso Read: Robinhood CEO Announces Plan to List Bitcoin ETF Soon\n\nSustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s Momentum\n\nThe crucial question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether ETC can maintain its impressive momentum. According to Changelly, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, ETC is anticipated to stay in positive territory over the next few days. The altcoin is predicted to reach as high as $22.59 on Saturday, Jan. 12, following a 5% daily surge. The average anticipated percentage surge for Ethereum Classic in the upcoming days ranges between 3-5%.\n\nSurging Trading Volumes and Neutral Market Sentiment\n\nIn tandem with Ethereum Classic\u2019s surge, there has been a significant spike in trading volumes. It escalated by 234% within a single day and reached a total of $1.54 billion. Despite these substantial movements in price and volume, the overall sentiment surrounding the Ethereum Classic remains neutral. This was indicated by on-chain data provided by Santiment.\n\nInvestor Watch: Monitoring Ethereum Classic Market Developments\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring the developments in the Ethereum Classic market. This is especially true in the aftermath of recent Bitcoin-related news that has stirred the cryptocurrency landscape. As Ethereum Classic continues to defy market expectations, its impressive surge and heightened trading volumes have captured the attention of enthusiasts.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Breaches $2,400 While BTC Bleeds, Will ETH Hit $3,000 Soon?\n\nThe recent 34% surge of Ethereum Classic serves as a testament to the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Investors are advised to remain vigilant, stay informed about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, and closely monitor any subsequent news that may impact Ethereum Classic\u2019s trajectory."

        "content": "Ethereum has been increasing in the past day in the hopes that an ETH ETF might be next in line on the SEC\u2019s agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, the probability of a further bullish continuation seems to remain high, considering what the charts are demonstrating.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily timeframe, the price has been trapped between the $2,100 and $2,400 levels over the last month. A breakout from either side of this range can determine the trend\u2019s short-term direction.\n\nA bearish breakout would likely result in a decline toward the 200-day moving average, located around the $1,900 mark. On the other hand, a break above the $2,400 level would pave the way for the price to target the $2,700 resistance zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, the recent choppy price action becomes much more clear. The cryptocurrency has tested both the higher and the lower boundary of the range several times.\n\nCurrently, the price is testing the $2,400 resistance area. A breakout from this level would result in a rally higher toward the $2,700 area, while a rejection could lead to a drop back to the support zone at $2,100.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has been going through a consolidation phase, the underlying dynamics of the futures market are displaying an interesting sign.\n\nThis chart demonstrates open interest, which is one of the most essential metrics for future market sentiment evaluation. It measures the number of open futures positions. Higher values are typically associated with higher volatility and vice versa.\n\nIt is evident that while the price has been moving in a tight range recently, the open interest has dropped considerably. A significant decline in open interest without a price plunge is considered a bullish signal, as it hints at the fact that the futures market is not overheated anymore, and the price can continue its gradual uptrend in the coming weeks."

The approval is also expected to have a palpable impact on the state of ETH.\n\nThere could be also be massive accumulation of ETH prior to the approval.\n\nVitalik chimes in\n\nSeparately, in a recent Reddit ask-me-anything (AMA) session hosted by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s research team on 10th January, Vitalik Buterin brought attention to the gas limit, proposing a modest increase to enhance network throughput.\n\nButerin highlighted the nearly three-year period during which the gas limit remained static, suggesting that a 33% increase to around 40 million from the current 30 million could contribute to the network\u2019s efficiency.\n\nThis adjustment aligns with Buterin\u2019s vision for maintaining Ethereum\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nThe proposed increase in the gas limit holds significant implications for Ethereum, as it aims to address scalability challenges and enhance the overall performance of the network.\n\nBy accommodating more transactions within each block, Ethereum can potentially lower transaction fees and improve user experience. Only time will tell whether this will help Ethereum attract more users to its network.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,415.34, reflecting a 5.07% price growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nMoreover, there was a surge in trading volume and an increased network growth. This showed that the spike in ETH\u2019s price was being driven by new addresses.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nHowever, the velocity at which ETH was trading had declined which meant that the number of addresses transferring their ETH declined materially in the last few days.\n\nThis could act as a hindrance in the price movement of ETH going forward.\n\nSource: Santiment"

        "content": "Wed 10 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe crypto market has experienced intense turbulence in recent days, following a false announcement that teased the imminent approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the SEC. While this misleading information has disenchanted Bitcoin investors, it has paradoxically energized Ethereum and many altcoins, which have seen their trading volumes explode upwards.\n\nEthereum and Altcoins Boosted by Optimism over Bitcoin ETFs\n\nDespite the Bitcoin ETF illusion turning against the queen of crypto, Ethereum cheerfully crossed the symbolic threshold of $2,400, with a 2.8% increase. More importantly, the decentralized cryptocurrency benefited from very high trading volumes, indicating growing investor interest in this digital asset with multiple use cases.\n\nMany altcoins like Avalanche, Solana, or Cardano also jumped between 3 to 8% simultaneously. This bullish surge reflects the market participants\u2019 optimism regarding a future approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States. Such a decision would pave the way for massive inflows of institutional capital, benefitting the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nBTC Struggles to Bounce Back in a Volatile Market\n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin is struggling to recover from its speculative excesses, after falling by more than $2,000 within 24 hours. Briefly surpassing the $47,000 mark, the original cryptocurrency fell back below $45,000, reflecting the market\u2019s nervousness after the ETF hoax.\n\nSome are hoping for support around $46,200, but caution remains advisable. Bitcoin is now trading around $45,000, far from its all-time high in November 2021. According to many analysts, this could be a \u201cbear market rally,\u201d a faint uptick in a sustained bear market. Others are more optimistic about a lasting rebound.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Dominance Erodes in Favor of Ethereum\n\nThese sharp jolts demonstrate the gradual emancipation of Ethereum and altcoins from Bitcoin, despite its still overwhelming dominance, accounting for about 53% of the crypto market cap. Boosted by record volumes, Ethereum and others are now progressing according to their own dynamics, little affected by Bitcoin\u2019s transient downturn.\n\nThis tumultuous episode reminds us of the volatile nature of the crypto Wild West, prone to extreme fluctuations based on false news or unverified rumors. It also marks Ethereum\u2019s spectacular breakthrough, which is emerging as the most serious alternative to Bitcoin, even if there is still a long way to go to dethrone the crypto veteran. The coming months promise to be exciting, with the prospect of a \u201cflippening,\u201d a reversal of the established order!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

According to Steve McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Funds, ETFs on Ethereum and Ripple could quickly follow.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin ETF, is it Ripple and Ethereum\u2019s turn?\n\nConfident about the future, Steve McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie Funds, stated in a recent Bloomberg interview that he \u201cwould not be surprised to see spot Ripple or Ethereum ETFs come to market\u201d following the approval of the first Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nThis optimism is based on the impending decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly replicate the price of Bitcoin, expected this week. Valkyrie\u2019s ETF is among the concerned products.\n\nMany observers see this as a major positive signal for the entire crypto sector. This regulatory advancement could pave the way for mainstream investors to adopt financial vehicles directly backed by cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith this precedent, Mr. McClurg anticipates that ETFs on other significant digital assets, like Ether or XRP, will quickly in turn receive the regulatory green light, capitalizing on the growing interest of investors in the asset class.\n\nA Growing Interest from Investors\n\nMr. McClurg emphasizes that investors\u2019 interest in diversifying their crypto holdings remains increasingly strong. He specifically mentions the recent decision by Grayscale to add Ripple to one of its publicly traded trusts.\n\nSuch publicly-focused financial vehicles facilitate access to cryptocurrencies for novice investors, he believes, paving the way for mass adoption.\n\nThough confident, Mr. McClurg admits that the regulatory approval process remains unpredictable. Nothing is yet entirely certain regarding the launch of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cAnything could still happen\u201c, he said, acknowledging that the regulatory environment remains complex. Administrative or political hurdles could still postpone the deadline or complicate the efforts of other players wishing to propose new crypto index funds.\n\nHowever, the potential validation this week of a first Spot Bitcoin ETF nonetheless seems to signify a turning point. If confirmed, this regulatory step forward could unlock the arrival of a new generation of crypto investment products, finally making these assets accessible to the general public.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "The term \u201cultrasound money\u201d has been thrown around quite a bit in the Ethereum (ETH) community, often describing the network\u2019s potential to become a deflationary asset with better tokenomics than Bitcoin (BTC). While some proponents believe this narrative is well-founded, others argue it is overstated and based on overly optimistic assumptions.\n\nIs The Ethereum \u201cUltrasound Money\u201d Narrative Exaggerated?\n\nIn a post on X, antiprosynthesis.eth, a developer, challenged the \u201cultrasound money\u201d narrative, arguing that it is often accompanied by jargon that may conceal the reality of Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy. Specifically, the analyst believes the narrative is a bit \u201coverboard\u201d and loaded with \u201ca bunch of pseudo-scientific hocus pocus\u201d that might mislead ordinary users.\n\nAdopting a neutral view, antiprosynthesis.eth, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy is, most importantly, designed to be sustainable without the dangerous pitfalls of hyperinflation or excessive deflation. The developer argues that striking a balance in token emissions is critical.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, this is achieved by burning a portion of gas fees. Following the activation of EIP-1559 in 2021, the first smart contracts platform changed its bidding system, creating a system where the network sets a base fee with the allowance for a user to \u201ctip\u201d the validator. The base fee is burnt, helping the network become deflationary\u2013or, as researchers argue, sustainable.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s case, the network will continue to issue new coins to miners until all the 21 million BTC are distributed. This will be more than a decade from now. To achieve this, the Bitcoin protocol has been halving mining rewards. In the early years of Bitcoin, miners received 50 BTC whenever they confirmed a block of transactions. However, after the network halves in April, miner rewards per block will fall to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe Road To Sustainability, Ethereum\u2019s Issuance Rate Continues To Fall\n\nComparing the two approaches, the Ethereum developer notes that each system has its mechanism of ensuring its tokenomics are sustainable. The analyst adds that the \u201cultrasound money\u201d narrative championed by supporters may be exaggerated and, to some degree, an overly optimistic assessment of ETH\u2019s ability to be deflationary.\n\nAs of January 10, Ethereum has destroyed over 3.9 million ETH since the implementation of EIP-1559 based on the Ultra Sound Money data. During this time, the network issued more than 6.9 million.\n\nThis confirms that Ethereum has been burning more ETH recently; it remains inflationary, to a smaller degree, like Bitcoin. Still, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s issuance rate has been dropping steadily due to increased token burning.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum price has recently witnessed a significant upswing, climbing by 8.5% in just 24 hours and registering a 15% increase over the past week. This surge has propelled ETH past the $2,500 mark, a level not seen since May 2022. The momentum came after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval, sparking investor speculation about the imminent approval of Ethereum\u2019s spot ETFs.\n\nEthereum price fluctuated between $2,200 and $2,300 in the past few days, with buying and selling pressure struggling to establish a clear market direction. However, the market soon gained traction, allowing ETH to break free from this range; currently, ETH price is hovering at $2,641. Despite encountering resistance at $2,450 and experiencing a brief correction, the bulls regained control, pushing the price above $2,600.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnticipation of Ethereum ETFs Fuels Market Optimism\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is optimistic following the historic approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10, 2024. This development has heightened expectations for the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs later in the year. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates a 70% chance of Ethereum ETF approval by May, further fueling market enthusiasm.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nIf the bulls maintain their momentum and push Ethereum past the $2,700 resistance level, the course could be clear for Ethereum price to test the $3,000 mark. Sustaining this level could set the stage for an attempt to breach the $4,000 resistance in the near future. Conversely, if bearish trends prevail, Ethereum could see a decline, testing support levels at $2,500 and potentially dropping to $2,450 by the weekend.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Point to Bullish Trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s market behavior reinforces the bullish sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a rising green histogram, signaling a dominance of buying pressure over selling. The MACD and signal lines are currently above the zero line, indicating bullish pressure. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator stands at a positive 0.42, suggesting a strong buying trend.\n\nThe four-hour technical indicators also support this bullish outlook.

        "content": "GITHUB REJECTION! While crypto traders, tradfi investors, financial institutions and probably lots of normies and newbies were engaging in the gripping speculation over whether U.S. regulators would approve a spot bitcoin ETF, a struggle over the very soul of the Bitcoin blockchain was taking place on the open-source developer platform GitHub . At the core of the matter was whether data-oriented applications like Ordinals inscriptions \u2013 often referred to as \" NFTs on Bitcoin \" \u2013 should be allowed on a network that purists argue should be preserved primarily as a settlement layer for peer-to-peer payments. In September, the longtime Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr, who sits in the latter camp, created a proposal \u2013 technically known as a \"pull request\" or PR \u2013 to put strict limits on the amount of data that could be stuffed into an individual transaction. The proposal quickly touched off an acrimonious debate that went on for months, until several days ago when Ava Chow , a maintainer of the paramount Bitcoin Core software, abruptly closed the PR without taking action. \"It's abundantly clear that this PR is controversial and, in its current state, has no hope of reaching a conclusion that is acceptable to everyone,\" Chow wrote, the last post in the thread. It's possible there could be additional chapters, though, since Dashjr later tweeted, \"Spam filtering isn't dead until the spam is dead.\""

Both the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators are also in positive territory. This would demonstrate that bulls are leading the ETH market. More closely, the MACD has crossed above the signal line (orange band), which is a bullish crossover.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics support bullish outlook for Ethereum price\n\nSantiment\u2019s daily active addresses metric supports the bullish outlook for the Ethereum price, showing a progressive surge in crowd interaction with ETH as more unique addresses are created. In mid-December, there were 387,000 daily active addresses, while the number currently stands at 413,000. This represents a 6.7% increase in just under a month.\n\nAlso, whale transactions for transfers of $100,000 and above have been spiking, accentuated by surging volumes to show increasing investor interest.\n\nETH Santiment: Daily active addresses, volume, whale transaction count\n\nOn the other hand, with the potential for early profit-taking, Ethereum price could correct if the bears have their way. The ensuing seller momentum could see ETH market value dwindle, losing the support at $2,388. In a dire case, an extended fall could send the proof-of-stake (PoS) token to the depths of $2,135, below which the prevailing bullish outlook would be invalidated if a lower low occurred.\n\n(This story was corrected on January 11 at 08:55 GMT to say that in a highly bullish case, Ethereum price could extend gains to the $3,000 psychological level, not $30,000.)"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTwitter has axed the option for paying premium users (formerly Twitter Blue subscribers) to use a verifiable NFT image as their profile picture (PFP), two years after debuting the feature,\n\nLaunched last January, the feature was billed as an exclusive benefit for paying users, introduced in the era before billionaire Elon Musk purchased the social media platform later that year. It was also seen by crypto advocates as a forward-thinking move that validated NFTs, ahead of similar decisions by Meta to integrate NFTs into Facebook and Instagram later that year.\n\nHowever, the ability for X Premium subscribers to activate the feature via the iPhone version of the mobile app is no longer available. TechCrunch first reported the move early Wednesday, noting that X Premium marketing no longer mentions the feature. Decrypt independently confirmed that the option is not currently offered within the app.\n\nUsers were previously able to designate an Ethereum NFT as a profile picture by confirming ownership via the blockchain, and the image would be shaped like a hexagon rather than the standard circular PFP. It\u2019s unclear whether users who still had an NFT equipped will still be able to use the verification method, or whether it profile pictures will still appear as hexagons on the platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwitter has yet to comment publicly on the decision. Decrypt reached out to the company and received an automatic reply stating, \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d Previously, under Musk\u2019s regime, the platform\u2019s press outreach email address returned a poop emoji to any received email.\n\nCrypto Twitter users have largely responded by memeing the news, with many people posting some variation of the following tweet: \u201cX has removed support for NFT PFPs. Just so you know: Digital property rights are not a joke. If any of you take screenshots of my [NFT] and pretend it's yours, I will sue you.\u201d\n\nX has removed support for NFT pfps. Just so you know: Digital property rights are not a joke. If any of you take screenshots of my CryptoPunk and pretend it's yours, I will sue you. pic.twitter.com/SHnSNEjXqo \u2014 Farokh (@farokh) January 10, 2024\n\nWhile Twitter was the first of the social media giants to embrace NFTs, Meta moved on much faster. In March 2023, Meta announced that it was \u201cwinding down\u201d support for NFTs on Instagram to focus on other priorities. Meta is still building towards its vision of the metaverse, a more immersive future internet, but has shifted more attention to AI development of late.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNews of Twitter's removal of the NFT profile picture feature comes following major crypto-related drama on the platform. On Tuesday, the official account of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tweeted that it had approved trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But minutes later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler tweeted that the account had been \"compromised\" and that the approval was not yet made.\n\nTwitter confirmed late Tuesday that the SEC account lacked two-factor authorization to secure access, and that someone had gained unauthorized access to a phone number tied to the account. On Wednesday, the SEC said that it has asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to help investigate the issue, with the regulator claiming that the false tweet was not a saved draft that an unauthorized user posted ahead of schedule.\n\nEven so, the SEC is still expected to announce the official approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States on Wednesday, with analysts projecting a late afternoon announcement ahead of trading expected to begin Thursday.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "What is Neon EVM (NEON): the first Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana - OKX",
        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is known to be a foundational element in blockchain technology. It enables secure and automated smart contract execution, underpins decentralized applications (DApps), and provides interoperability across many different crypto projects.\n\nThe technology's widespread adoption, security measures, and support for token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 contribute to its role in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly among decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nNeon EVM represents fresh evolution for EVM. The promise of Neon EVM lies in its ability to integrate EVM capabilities into the Solana (SOL) blockchain. This means developers can leverage the familiar EVM environment for deploying and executing smart contracts on Solana, combining the strengths of Ethereum's (ETH) ecosystem with the speed and scalability of Solana's blockchain. Meanwhile, the interoperability enabled through Neon EVM opens up new possibilities for DApps and supports the transfer of Ethereum's projects to the Solana network.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n\nTo understand the impact of Neon EVM, let's start with the basics. The EVM lies at the core of Ethereum's functionality, serving as a decentralized runtime environment that executes smart contracts. In other words, it translates code into tangible actions, powering the development of a diverse range of DApps.\n\nWhat does EVM-based mean?\n\nThe term 'EVM-based' refers to blockchain networks directly built using the EVM architecture, incorporating the EVM natively into their infrastructure. This direct integration provides one-to-one compatibility, allowing smart contracts written for Ethereum to execute on EVM-based networks. Ethereum-based projects can migrate effortlessly to these platforms, benefiting from the familiarity of the Ethereum environment.\n\nWhat does EVM-compatible mean?\n\nWhen a blockchain is labeled EVM-compatible, it means the chain follows EVM standards without being directly integrated with the core architecture. While EVM-based chains directly replicate Ethereum's Virtual Machine, EVM-compatible chains maintain compatibility with Ethereum's tooling and smart contract standards but might introduce additional features or optimizations.\n\nSimilar to EVM-based blockchains, developers benefit from a familiar environment, using Ethereum-compatible programming languages and tools, such as the widely familiar Solidity language. This compatibility also allows for interoperability, providing a smooth transition for projects between Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM?\n\nNeon EVM is positioned as the first EVM on Solana, allowing developers to deploy EVM-compatible DApps on Solana with minimal reconfiguration. The platform enables DApps to process Ethereum-like transactions while embracing Solana's functionalities, including parallel execution of transactions and low gas fees.\n\nWith Neon EVM, developers can continue using familiar smart contract languages and Ethereum tools. This includes writing smart contracts in Solidity and Vyper, funding DApps with MetaMask, and deploying DApps on Solana through the Truffle environment, all while taking advantage of the efficiency of Solana transactions. This not only supports the transition for Ethereum developers but also potentially expands their reach by tapping into Solana's user base and accessing the platform's liquidity.\n\nNEON, the native utility and governance token, plays a broad role, from enabling transactions to decentralized governance through Neon DAO.\n\nHow does Neon EVM differ from Ethereum's EVM?\n\nOne difference between Neon EVM and Ethereum's EVM lies in the execution of transactions. While Ethereum's EVM executes smart contracts sequentially to maintain consistent and predictable outcomes, Neon EVM uses the parallel execution capability of Solana to enable smart contracts to be processed concurrently.\n\nTo allow for parallel transaction processing, Neon EVM bundles transactions and sends them to the Solana mainnet. Under ideal conditions, Neon EVM achieves a throughput of 4,500 transactions per second (TPS), surpassing Ethereum's general limit of around 1,500 TPS.\n\nHow does Neon EVM work?\n\nNeon EVM serves as a gateway for Ethereum-based applications to access the high transaction speeds and low transaction costs of Solana without changing its codebase. Here's an overview of the platform's key components and functionalities:\n\nNeon Proxy\n\nNeon Proxy allows for the migration of Ethereum DApps to the Solana blockchain. Acting as a bridge, Neon Proxy channels Ethereum-like transactions on the Solana network with minimal friction. This component packages Neon transactions, which represent Ethereum-style transactions, into Solana transactions. These packaged transactions are then processed on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its parallel execution capability and high throughput. Neon operators, responsible for running Neon Proxy servers, support this migration. They accept payments in NEON tokens and manage transactions within the Solana ecosystem using SOL.\n\nNeonScan\n\nNeonScan functions as both a block explorer and an analytics platform designed for users and developers. As a block explorer, NeonScan allows users to inspect and analyze transactions, blocks, and tokens associated with the Neon EVM on the Solana blockchain. This transparency provides users with a comprehensive view of the network's activity, allowing them to verify transactions, track token movements, and understand block information.\n\nNeonPass\n\nNeonPass is a tool that helps enable the transfer of ERC-20 tokens between the Solana and Neon EVM. This tool simplifies the cross-network cryptocurrency transfer process, allowing users to navigate the complexities with ease. Each transaction conducted through NeonPass incurs a gas fee, payable either in NEON or SOL tokens, depending on the originating network.\n\nNeon Faucet\n\nNeon Faucet is a service designed to help users obtain NEON and other ERC-20 test tokens. It's a resource for developers working within the Neon devnet, providing them with the necessary test tokens for application testing in a risk-free environment.\n\nBy using these tokens, Neon Faucet enhances the application development and testing processes on the Neon EVM platform before their deployment on the main network. Users looking to use Neon Faucet need to connect their crypto wallet to the service, which then allows them to access NEON and other ERC-20 test tokens for a thorough and secure testing experience.\n\nWho created Neon EVM?\n\nNeon EVM, developed by Neon Labs, operates under the oversight of the Neon Foundation for its development and governance. Marina Guryeva is the founder and CEO of Neon Labs and has been active in the blockchain space since 2015.\n\nGuryeva previously served as the Director of CyberFund, an investment platform for blockchain startups. In 2019, she assumed the role of Director at Commun, a blockchain-based social network. In 2021, Guryeva founded Neon Labs with the aim of integrating Solana's scalability and low transaction fees into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNEON token: powering transactions and governance\n\nThe NEON token, native to the Neon EVM ecosystem, serves a dual role. It functions as a utility token, facilitating transactions on the Neon platform including transfers, DApp deployment, interactions within DApps, and more. Beyond transactions, NEON serves as a governance token, empowering holders to actively participate in decentralized decision-making processes through Neon DAO.\n\nThe final word\n\nNeon EVM's mission within the Solana ecosystem is clear: to harness Solana's capabilities while providing Ethereum developers with a platform that feels like home. This integration brings forth a new era of possibilities for developers seeking high-performance blockchain solutions. As Neon EVM looks ahead on its roadmap, the promise of continued innovation underscores its commitment to shaping a multi-chain future."

This growth is attributed to increased bitcoin demand and higher institutional adoption due to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum could grow substantially, with an upgrade (EIP-4844) enhancing transaction throughput and reducing costs. Additionally, the integration of AI in the crypto industry is foreseen to bring significant improvements in transaction analysis, efficiency, and security.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2023, we saw a resurgence in bullishness in the crypto industry, and we expect to see the same energy carry over into 2024 as increasing adoption, revenue growth, and the integration of new technologies are on the horizon.\n\nHowever, new tokens and assets, uncertain regulations, security concerns, and technological innovations speak to the industry\u2019s dynamic nature. This can make it challenging to predict upcoming trends, let alone keep up with them.\n\nThat said, we see some emerging trends that will help fuel the excitement 2023 brought to the crypto industry. These trends include a surge in bitcoin\u2019s value, Coinbase\u2019s revenue growth, the increasing adoption of Ethereum, the rising influence of stablecoins, and the integration of advanced technologies like AI in crypto.\n\nRead more about the crypto trends we see shaping the industry in 2024.\n\nTrend 1: The Surge of Bitcoin\n\nIn 2023, we saw bitcoin rally 150% higher, and at the beginning of January 2024, we saw its price surge to over $47,000. Analysts predict bitcoin\u2019s price rise will continue throughout the year, with the potential to reach an all-time high and hit $80,000 before year\u2019s end.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price trajectory is strong. Chart via Coinmarketcap.com\n\nThere are a couple of factors at play that support this prediction. For one, there\u2019s the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, which puts bitcoin within the reach of ordinary investors, directly within their brokerage accounts.\n\nTraded on stock exchanges, bitcoin spot ETFs hold bitcoin as their primary asset and directly track the price of bitcoin, therefore providing investors with price exposure without directly owning the asset. This should help bitcoin appeal to a broader range of investors, leading to increased demand and a price increase.\n\nAnother factor that could lead to a surge in bitcoin price is the halving event, which is set to take place in April 2024. These halving events occur roughly every four years, the last occurring in May 2020. Bitcoin halving cuts the reward for bitcoin mining in half, meaning miners receive 50% fewer bitcoins for verifying transactions. Historically, these halving events have been associated with price increases as a reduced rate of new bitcoin creation leads to scarcity, eventually increasing demand and price.\n\nTrend 2: Coinbase\u2019s Growth Trajectory\n\nCoinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US by trading volume, and the company has spent years building brand authority with investors, giving them pricing power. 2023 saw Coinbase\u2019s stock soar 418%, and its revenue saw a 14% increase. The company is well-positioned to carry this growth into 2024, with the potential to double its revenue.\n\n\n\nCoinbase shares have outpaced even bitcoin.\n\nThe bitcoin ETF and bitcoin halving event are two of the main catalysts for the predicted growth at Coinbase, as both events should lead to an increased demand in bitcoin, which accounts for most of the platform\u2019s trading volume.\n\nThe approval of bitcoin ETFs will also likely lead to an increase in institutional adoption, as insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors who would otherwise be reluctant to engage with crypto will be more likely to invest, as ETFs offer a regulated and well-known investment structure. Coinbase is thus far the sole custody provider for all the proposed bitcoin ETFs. which should generate substantial revenue in the form of custody fees.\n\nTrend 3: Ethereum\u2019s Rising Tide\n\nEthereum will also likely see rapid growth in 2024, with some analysts predicting its revenue will double.\n\nThis is partly due to a scheduled critical upgrade known as EIP-4844, which is expected to occur in the year's second half. The upgrade will boost throughput to 100,000 transactions per second and reduce transaction costs by as much as 90%, making the network more accessible to mainstream users and driving adoption.\n\nOver the years, Ethereum has made significant efforts to improve the adoption of crypto projects. Ethereum offers smart contract functionality, serves as the primary platform for the DeFi ecosystem, provides a framework for tokenizing and selling NFTs, and enables the creation and issuance of new tokens. In short, it acts as a foundation for the growth of various crypto projects, and the reduced transaction cost will only make the platform more appealing to its users.\n\nTrend 4: The Stablecoin Revolution\n\nWhile most of the attention leading into 2024 has centered around bitcoin, investors want to keep their eyes on stablecoins in the coming year.\n\nIn the latter half of 2023, JP Morgan announced an improved tokenized payment platform, PayPal launched its stablecoin, and Visa expanded its stablecoin settlement capabilities. These events complement the optimistic forecast predicted for stablecoins in 2024, as Bitwise predicts that stablecoins will surpass Visa in terms of settled volume.\n\nIn 2023, we also saw significant advancements in stablecoin regulation. According to Cointelegraph, 25 countries had stablecoin regulations in place last year. The US will likely act on stablecoin regulation in the coming year. Doing so will give the US a mechanism to oversee adoption and ensure its central role in supervising and regulating stablecoin issuers. Additionally, it\u2019ll allow the US to serve as a home for growing businesses that will likely be strategically significant in expanding the role USD and other stablecoins play in the global economy.\n\nTrend 5: On-Chain Innovations for Traditional Finance\n\nWe will also likely see a rise in on-chain innovations in 2024. In 2023, JP Morgan collaborated with a handful of blockchain firms to demonstrate how proof of concept could allow asset managers to tokenize funds on a blockchain of their choice and purchase and rebalance their positions in tokenized assets across multiple chains.\n\nThe demonstration coincides with the traditional financial sector\u2019s growing interest in crypto and blockchain technology. In 2024, we will see more traditional finance companies explore on-chain innovations through partnerships and services as regulatory clarity improves.\n\nTrend 6: AI, Decentralization, and Crypto\n\nIntegrating AI tools into the crypto industry holds immense potential, and we expect to see some of this potential come to fruition in 2024. More companies will use AI algorithms to enhance transaction speed, analyze transaction data, and improve efficiency and security.\n\nAI trading tools will also become more refined and user-friendly, making crypto trading more accessible to many investors. AI will also be integral to real-time sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, and forecasting. Additionally, we will likely see the rise of AI-powered personal trading assistants capable of learning an individual trader\u2019s risk appetites and preferences to offer customized advice and manage trades.\n\n2024 will also likely see the growth of decentralized prediction markets. While prediction markets have existed for years, crypto takes them to the next level by making them permissionless and borderless and automating functions like making payouts and determining winners and losers. We expect decentralized prediction markets to become a primary venue for sports-based and event-based wagering.\n\nLastly, you can expect financial advisors to allocate to crypto in 2024 increasingly. According to a Bitwise survey, 98% of financial advisors with crypto allocations in client accounts plan to maintain or increase that exposure in 2024.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nAs you can see, many exciting crypto trends are emerging in 2024. Analysts predict that bitcoin will rise in price and prominence, Coinbase\u2019s revenue will grow, Ethereum will establish itself as a powerhouse, and stablecoin adoption will increase.\n\nWe can also expect more financial companies to explore on-chain innovations and AI playing a more prominent role in the crypto world. If you\u2019re currently invested in crypto, we recommend regularly looking at your portfolio to determine how these trends may affect your investments.\n\nAdditionally, subscribe to Bitcoin Market Journal for the latest news for crypto investors!"

Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nIf historical analogs continue to hold true, and we have no evidence at this time that they would not, Ethereum is all set to take the crypto leadership mantle now that spot Bitcoin ETFs have begun trading.\n\n$1B in 4 mins of Bitcoin ETF trading https://t.co/Jq1Q64GvXJ \u2014 On-Chain College (@OnChainCollege) January 11, 2024\n\nThe cumulative volume of spot Bitcoin ETFs hit $1 billion in just the first four minutes of trading! This is a phenomenal level of activity, even against already-elevated expectations.\n\nWhat's more, Bitcoin has now hit a new 2024 high, having zoomed past the $48,000 price level and quickly approaching the $49,000 handle.\n\nThe ETFs open up new institutional flows that waited for regulatory and SEC approval. It's a green flag. But there's even more. The ETFs were only approved for CASH subscriptions (not in-kind). So every purchase takes more Bitcoin off the market. This metric is going higher. \u2014 Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) January 11, 2024\n\nFor the benefit of those who are still not sure how the launch of these spot Bitcoin ETFs affects the world's preeminent cryptocurrency, every unit of these ETFs that is purchased translates into actual Bitcoin purchases in real-time, barring settlement-related delays.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 ETF approval could send Bitcoin to $60,000 near term - deVere's Green Nigel Green, a long-term cryptocurrency advocate and CEO of the deVere Group, sees the landmark SEC approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday sending the cryptocurrency higher - perhaps to $60,000 as\u2026 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 11, 2024\n\nIt is hardly a surprise, therefore, that bullish Bitcoin projections just keep rolling past analyst commentaries. DeVerre's Nigel Green now expects the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to hit the $60,000 price level as soon as March 2024, well ahead of the halving event in April, when Bitcoin's mining reward will again be cut in half in what is a regular 4-year cycle.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 CAHTIE WOOD: BASE CASE FOR #BITCOIN IS $600,000 RANGE, BULL CASE IS $1.5M BY 2030 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 11, 2024\n\nAdditionally, ARK Invest's Cathie Wood seems to have stolen the limelight for ultra-bullish projections by predicting that Bitcoin is expected to hit the $600,000 price level by 2030 in her base case scenario, and a whopping $1.5 million in the bullish case.\n\nWhen the #Bitcoin futures launched in 2017, the coin that went up 100% within weeks was #Ethereum When the Coinbase IPO launched in 2021, the count that went up 80% within weeks was #Ethereum#Bitcoin put in tops on both events ($20k+$64k), & proceeded to dump after \u2014 Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) December 22, 2023\n\nNonetheless, we've witnessed these manic times in the crypto world a number of times already over the past decade, and each time Ethereum was able to outrun Bitcoin in the ultra-bullish phase of the cycle. In the aftermath of the launch of Bitcoin futures in 2017, Ethereum went up around 100 percent within the next few weeks. When Coinbase went public in 2021, Ethereum rallied by around 80 percent in the immediate aftermath.\n\nThe #Ethereum ETF will draw more interest and excitement than the BTC ETF leading into it Its just simply based on timing, post-halving is a much more bullish time period which means market participants likely grow exponentially between now and then Bitcoin will do great to \u2014 Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) January 10, 2024\n\nOf course, spot Ethereum ETFs are also now expected to launch by May 2024, just around the time when the euphoria around Bitcoin's halving event would be peaking.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 More big whales are withdrawing $ETH from #Binance in the past hours. \u2705 Join the #SpotOnChain website and mobile app for more updates about whales now: https://t.co/UV6E05ZjXZ https://t.co/OZ1Jk42Qkq pic.twitter.com/Ob6183DpNz \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 11, 2024\n\nBased on the historical analogs, we can predict with a fair amount of confidence that Ethereum's time to shine is now approaching. And, crypto whales are already positioning for this eventuality.\n\nDo you think Bitcoin is about to be upstaged by Ethereum? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below."

        "title": "Best Coins to Buy in the Bull Run: Riding the Crypto Bull Run with ApeMax, Helium, Tectum, Celestia, Chainlink, Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin - - Disrupt Africa",
        "content": "As 2024 dawns, the cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement for a potential upcoming bull run, fueled by the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving. This phase of burgeoning possibilities has attracted the gaze of both seasoned and novice crypto enthusiasts, looking to ride the wave if the bull run charges for an explosive year.\n\nIn this vibrant landscape, explore the most promising cryptocurrencies: ApeMax, Helium, Tectum, Celestia, Chainlink, Solana, Ethereum, and the iconic Bitcoin. Each of these coins offers unique value to the evolving crypto world. Leveraging the latest market trends and data, we delve into the reasons behind their popularity within the crypto community.\n\n1. ApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax, a rising meme coin in crypto, stands out for innovation and a growing community. Introducing the pioneering \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d staking feature, ApeMax has over 9,000 token holders and 3.5 billion staked tokens. This feature allows ApeMax holders to earn rewards by staking their tokens on preferred entities, offering immediate utility and engagement opportunities seldom seen in presale coins. Eligible early adopters can swiftly engage in staking after purchasing even during the presale phase.\n\n2. Helium (HNT)\n\nHelium (HNT) is a decentralized blockchain network catering to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Introduced in July 2019, the Helium mainnet supports communication among low-powered wireless devices, facilitating data transmission across its node network.\n\n3. Tectum (TET)\n\nTectum is known for its high-speed, scalable blockchain technology, focusing on creating a seamless user experience. It aims to provide solutions for real-world applications by offering fast transaction speeds with minimal fees.\n\n4. Celestia (TIA)\n\nA modular blockchain platform, Celestia is designed for interoperability and scalability. It stands out by offloading computation to specialized rollup chains, aiming to create a more efficient \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d for blockchain communication.\n\n5. Chainklink (LINK)\n\nA powerhouse oracle network, Chainlink bridges the gap between blockchain contracts and real-world data, enabling secure and reliable interactions beyond the chain. Its widespread adoption and deep integration with DeFi protocols position it as a key player in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\n6. Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana is renowned for its incredible speed and low transaction costs, boasting the ability to process thousands of transactions per second (TPS). Solana\u2019s rapidity stems from its distinctive hybrid consensus mechanism, merging Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for energy efficiency with a novel Proof-of-History (PoH) algorithm.\n\n7. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, a trailblazer in blockchain technology, transformed the landscape with smart contracts \u2013 self-executing agreements that activate once preset conditions are met. This breakthrough enabled diverse applications, from digital marketplaces to decentralized finance (DeFi), securing Ethereum\u2019s status as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\n8. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin, known as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d is the first cryptocurrency, established in 2009 to enable decentralized, peer-to-peer financial transactions. Bitcoin\u2019s independence from central authorities, secure blockchain-based transaction recording, and limited supply of 21 million coins contribute to its value and potential inflation resistance.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin influence when the crypto bull run will happen?\n\nAlthough it is impossible to predict if and when a crypto bull run will happen, Bitcoin often influences the timing and sentiment around a crypto bull run because it is the leading and most established cryptocurrency. As the pioneer and most widely recognized digital currency, Bitcoin tends to set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market. A Bitcoin bull run can impact other innovative altcoins like ApeMax.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs talks of an upcoming crypto surge grow louder, attention shifts towards diverse digital currencies. Beyond the big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, other innovative altcoins like ApeMax, Celestia, Solana, and many more, emerge as noteworthy contenders, each catering to the niches of their community.\n\nYet, amidst the excitement, it\u2019s crucial for crypto enthusiasts to approach this landscape with caution and thorough research. Understanding the risks inherent to cryptocurrencies is essential. The crypto market\u2019s volatility and factors like regulatory shifts, technological advancements, and global economic trends significantly influence its direction. Predicting which digital currencies will shine remains uncertain.\n\nFor comprehensive details on ApeMax, refer to the official website and ensure compliance with geographical limitations before any purchase."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Fees Increase, Holders Switch to Meme Moguls (MGLS) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "Ethereum has yet to scale its Layer-1 architecture, which is causing the network fees to skyrocket and holders to lose faith in the project. Meme Moguls (MGLS) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are two standout projects picking up pace as holders look for alternative options. Notably, Meme Moguls is predicted to surge 30x as it navigates through a presale of discounted tokens. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nWill Shiba Inu (SHIB) Reach $0.00002000 In 2024?\n\nShiba Inu is a memecoin that rose to fame in 2021 by copying the Dogecoin playbook of using a beloved dog as its mascot. Early buyers of Shiba Inu saw a massive return on their investment, with the coin\u2019s value surging by more than 1000x in less than a year.\n\nWith a current market cap of $5.66B, Shiba Inu isn\u2019t far from achieving its ultimate goal of \u2018killing\u2019 Dogecoin ($11.53B market cap) to become the top dog of memecoins. However, Shiba Inu is more than 500x the valuation of Meme Moguls, so the potential gains are less significant.\n\nStill, holders of other cryptos are switching to Shiba Inu due to the consistent innovation from the team. For example,Shiba Inu has just launched an NFT clothing collection with Busta Rhymes. This adds to the decentralized exchange, layer-2 protocol, and multi-coin ecosystem.\n\nPricewise, Shiba Inu is now trading at $0.000009559 after starting the year at $0.000008000. Market analysts note that there is heavy resistance sitting at $0.00001000 to $0.00001100, but if Shiba Inu breaks through, it could potentially reach $0.00002000 by the end of 2024\n\nInvestors Flock to Meme Moguls (MGLS) for Potential 100x Growth\n\nInvestors who missed out on Shiba Inu\u2019s early gains are looking for the next big memecoin opportunity. With its attractive combination of gaming, education, and rewards, Meme Moguls could be just that.\n\nThis play-to-earn platform enables users to step into a realm of virtual meme trading. So get ready to channel your inner Elon Musk and invest your way to the top of this revolutionary new trading virtual platform. The fun is big, but the rewards are bigger!\n\nUsers compete with friends and other players through simulated investing to build the most successful meme portfolio. Those who use the investment strategies to their advantage can turn simulated profits into real cashable returns.\n\nThe MGLS token is the native currency within the Meme Moguls ecosystem. Holding it comes with staking rewards, governance rights, and funds to purchase items from the in-game marketplace.\n\nInvestors can now purchase MGLS tokens at a reduced price of $0.0027 during stage 4 of the Meme Moguls presale. This price will keep increasing in each presale stage, so early investors stand to make the most gains.\n\nMarket experts have pointed out that Meme Moguls distinguishes itself within the saturated memecoin arena through its unique combination of gaming, educational elements, and substantial rewards.\n\nThis unique mix positions Meme Moguls favorably for substantial growth, with analysts suggesting that a 100-fold increase in its value as it enters the broader market is within the realm of possibility.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\nEthereum (ETH)\u2019s Fee Surge: A Roadblock or a Path to Innovation?\n\nAccording todata from Ycharts, Ethereum gas fees have risen 141% in the last year to a current fee of 0.9084 USD/tx at the time of writing. These Ethereum fees rise when the network is congested, making transactions more expensive and slower.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rising fees have caused layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum to gain popularity as they offer faster and cheaper transactions. However, Ethereum\u2019s modular approach could take some time to come to fruition, and in the meantime, many investors are turning to alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe EIP-4844 upgrade is another potential solution to the high fees on Ethereum, as it uses blobs to make it cheap to send layer-2 data to the mainnet. EIP-4844 is due to go live in the first half of 2024.\n\nPricewise, Ethereum has recently breached the $2,130 resistance level that had held the price down for more than a year. However, the momentum has stopped, and the price is now consolidating beneath the $2,400 level. The potential for aspot Ethereum ETFcould be the next big catalyst as it opens up the market to a broader investor base.\n\nFor more information about the Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale follow the link below:\n\nWebsite: https://mememoguls.com/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/meme_moguls"

        "content": "The long-awaited arrival of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US has sparked a surge in cryptocurrency prices, with Ethereum Classic leading the charge among altcoins.\n\nAfter languishing around $20 for months, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has skyrocketed over 50% in the past seven days, currently hovering around $29.45 and just a breath away from reclaiming the $30 mark.\n\nThis impressive rally comes amidst a broader market upswing triggered by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) historic approval of the Bitcoin Trust ETF on January 10th, 2024.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nETC price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko\n\nEthereum Classic Surge: A Combination Of Factors\n\nETF-fueled optimism: The approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF signifies increased institutional interest in the crypto market, a development that traditionally benefits the entire ecosystem, including altcoins like ETC. This optimism is reflected in the strong performance of other major cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum witnessing a 10% climb and briefly hitting a 20-month high above $2,600.\n\nEthereum Classic\u2019s unique appeal: Compared to its Ethereum counterpart, Ethereum Classic boasts a smaller market cap and lower transaction fees, potentially making it a more attractive option for traders seeking higher returns and cheaper on-chain activity. Its recent network upgrades have also bolstered confidence in its technological capabilities.\n\nSpillover effect and community hype: The Bitcoin ETF approval has undoubtedly fueled a general sense of bullishness across the crypto landscape, influencing investor sentiment towards altcoins with perceived potential. Additionally, the strong community support and active development around Ethereum Classic further contribute to its upward momentum.\n\nETC market cap currently at $4.248 billion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nETC Trading Volume Soars\n\nThe surge isn\u2019t just limited to price. Ethereum Classic\u2019s trading volume has also soared by a staggering 276% in the past 24 hours, reaching a volume of $1.8 billion.\n\nThis increase in trading activity further validates the market\u2019s interest in Ethereum Classic and potentially indicates continued upward pressure on its price.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains highly volatile. While the Bitcoin spot ETF approval and Ethereum Classic\u2019s recent performance are positive indicators, investors should conduct thorough research and consider both the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nWith its strong community, technological advancements, and now, the tailwinds of the Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum Classic has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the current altcoin rally.\n\nWhether it can sustain its momentum and break through the $30 barrier remains to be seen, but its recent performance signals a renewed level of enthusiasm for this resilient blockchain project.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock"

        "content": "Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently made a bullish prediction for the Ethereum price against Bitcoin in the near future, noting the path for this to happen. According to a social media post by the analyst, price action on the ETH/BTC pair for the next months will center around spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a rotation into ETH also in the prediction.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Prediction of 100% Ethereum Price Rise Against Bitcoin\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently took to X to share a chart of Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) on the weekly timeframe. Price action on the chart forms green (bullish) candles during periods of Ethereum\u2019s performance over Bitcoin, while red (bearish) candles are formed during periods of Ethereum\u2019s underperformance against Bitcoin.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nXRP And XLM Price Correlation Persists, Ripple CTO Explains Why 8 months ago\n\nTaking a look at the chart shared by Van De Poppe shows that Ethereum\u2019s performance on the ETH/BTC pair has been on a decline since the middle of 2022. This decline particularly increased during the last quarter of 2023, as the enthusiasm regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs led to a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Consequently, the analyst noted that Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin is now around the 2022 low of 0.04922.\n\nAccording to Van De Poppe, the approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to the creation of another liquidation candle on ETH/BTC to eventually take the liquidity around the 2022 low. This would eventually lead to a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair would be propelled to a target just above 0.12 by the rotation, signifying an increase of more than 100%. Notably, the last time ETH reached this level on the ETH/BTC pair was during the crypto\u2019s first major bull run in 2018.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we\u2019ll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nETH bulls regain control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe Rotation Game Has Started\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the SEC on Wednesday, causing the price of Bitcoin to spike to $48,600, its highest point since April 2022. However, the price of Bitcoin has stalled and is now trading at $45,839, about where it was when the news of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs came out.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum rose over $2,500 to reach $2,600, its highest point since April 2022. Ethereum has maintained this gain to outperform Bitcoin and is trading at $2,618 at the time of writing.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nIs Cardano The Next Solana? Institutional Investors Clamor For ADA Exposure 8 months ago\n\nAccording to another post on social media by Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe price action since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests that the rotation is already happening on the ETH/BTC pair.\n\n\u201cThe rotation game is happening already,\u201d he stated, adding a $3,500 price target for ETH.\n\nThe rotation game is happening already.

How to Find an Ethereum Contract Address A block explorer is a web-based application enabling users to browse and search the Ethereum blockchain for various activities, including transactions, addresses, tokens, and current prices. Etherscan stands out as the most widely used block explorer for Ethereum. These platforms are useful for locating contract addresses, which can be done by searching for either the decentralized application (dApp) or the contract directly.\n\n\n\nMost Ethereum wallets compatible with ERC-20 tokens, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or MyEtherWallet, typically provide the contract addresses for the tokens they support. If you hold a particular token in your wallet, you\u2019ll often find its contract address displayed within the wallet\u2019s user interface. Numerous decentralized applications (dApps) and token projects list their contract addresses on their official websites. These addresses can typically be found in sections such as the FAQ, at the bottom of the homepage, or within the documentation area of the site. Individuals with technical expertise have the option of employing developer tools and Web3 platforms for a more direct method of locating and engaging with Ethereum contract addresses. Covalent, for instance, offers powerful APIs that facilitate the querying of blockchain data, which includes the discovery of contract addresses. Practical Uses of Ethereum Contract Addresses Prior to sending or receiving ERC-20 tokens, which are the standard format for tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s crucial to confirm the token\u2019s authenticity by verifying its contract address. This step helps ensure that you are interacting with the genuine token and not a fake one. When engaging with decentralized applications (dApps), being aware of the contract address is essential for direct interaction with the smart contract. This knowledge is particularly useful for various activities, such as executing trades, engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or utilizing a decentralized exchange (DEX). For developers, the comprehension and utilization of contract addresses are fundamental aspects. Each time a new contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it generates a unique address. It\u2019s crucial for developers to record this address for any subsequent interactions with the contract. Key Considerations and Safety Tips Always double-check addresses : Given the irreversible nature of transactions on the blockchain, it\u2019s imperative to verify the accuracy of the contract address you\u2019re interacting with to avoid any irreversible errors.\n\n: Given the irreversible nature of transactions on the blockchain, it\u2019s imperative to verify the accuracy of the contract address you\u2019re interacting with to avoid any irreversible errors. Beware of scams : In the realm of cryptocurrency, phishing and scams are common threats. It\u2019s crucial to use contract addresses obtained only from reliable and trusted sources to ensure safety.\n\n: In the realm of cryptocurrency, phishing and scams are common threats. It\u2019s crucial to use contract addresses obtained only from reliable and trusted sources to ensure safety. Understand gas fees: Engaging with Ethereum contract addresses necessitates the payment of gas fees, and these fees can fluctuate depending on the level of network congestion.
