        "title": "SEC completes abrupt U-turn to approve Ethereum ETFs in \u2018politically driven\u2019 move - Fortune",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has green-lighted the listing of eight spot Ether exchange-traded fund on U.S. stock exchanges, approving the asset manager\u2019s 19b-4 form on Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest regulatory 180s in recent SEC history,\u201d VanEck\u2019s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, told Fortune in a statement. Issuers include BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity and Grayscale, among others.\n\nThe agency\u2019s relative silence over the pending applications in recent months led many in the cryptocurrency industry to regard an approval this year as a pipe dream. Bloomberg analysts were predicting the odds of approval to be as low as 25% as late as Monday afternoon. But then, in a sudden turn of events, on Monday, CoinDesk first reported that the issuers were \u201cabruptly\u201d asked by regulators to update their 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis. Since then, at least eight of the nine issuers have done so\u2014and Bloomberg\u2019s experts raised their projection to 75%. The price of Ether has soared 25% since Monday, trading at $3,855 as of 5:13 p.m. EST.\n\nThe SEC will not be commenting on the order, a spokesperson told Fortune.\n\nThe updates requested by the SEC on Monday remain undisclosed, but Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, told Fortune he knows \u201cfor a fact\u201d that staking will be prohibited. Indeed, Fidelity this week updated its S-1 filing with the staking component omitted.\n\nBut for trading of the financial products to begin, the SEC must next approve the issuers\u2019 S-1 filings. These forms outline to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens. But it\u2019s also understood that the approval of these forms is a case of \u201cwhen not if,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart wrote on X.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t recall anytime there would be S-1s not approved after a 19b-4 approval. I don\u2019t think a precedent exists,\u201d Balchnaus added. He estimates the forms will take about two weeks to be approved, as he expects there to be only one round of comments from the SEC. That\u2019s because the spot Bitcoin ETFs already did a lot of the \u201ctrailblazing,\u201d so in this case, the applications will require minor \u201cfine-tuning.\u201d In the case of Bitcoin ETFs, each round of comments required two weeks to complete.\n\n\u201cAt Grayscale, we appreciate the opportunity to engage constructively with regulators as they review spot Ethereum ETFs, and we remain optimistic about the potential of bringing Ethereum further into the U.S. regulatory perimeter in the ETF wrapper,\u201d a Grayscale spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThis is a \u201ckey step\u201d to offering U.S. investors \u201ceasier access, higher protection, and safeguards,\u201d an Invesco spokesperson said.\n\n\u2018A legitimate voting block\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s the question erupting throughout crypto: Why did the SEC change its tune? Experts told Fortune it was likely a political, top-down order. The approval on Thursday is \u201cproof that the crypto crowd is a legitimate voting block,\u201d says VanEck\u2019s Sigel.\n\nA bipartisan group of crypto-friendly House lawmakers urged the SEC and Chairman Gary Gensler to approve the ETFs in a letter on Wednesday. \u201cThe current digital asset regulatory landscape presents various risks to consumers, investors, and market participants,\u201d they wrote. An approval would offer investors access to crypto in a safer, more transparent and regulated format, they argued.\n\nAdmittedly, although the letter is unlikely to have tipped the scale, it does add to a building consensus in Washington that the elusive crypto vote may have weight.\n\n\u201cPolitics is powerful, and especially in an election year. What we\u2019ve heard inside is that this was politically driven. The Democrats do not want to see Donald Trump and the Republicans win on this issue, and lose votes from single-issue voters,\u201d says Balchunas.\n\nA survey published this week by the Federal Reserve reveals that just 1% of Americans used crypto to buy something in 2023, but in a razor-thin election, with Trump polling just 1% ahead of President Joe Biden, even 100,000 votes or so could make the difference.\n\n\u2018Very gratifying\u2019\n\nAs a result, the crypto community appears to be a growing priority in Washington, D.C. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a landmark piece of regulation that would establish a supervisory framework around the \u201cmarket structure.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, outlines the separation of powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as creating rules for pivotal questions such as commingling and custody. While the bill was supported by 208 Republicans, at first it was only favored forward by a handful of stubborn, crypto-friendly Democrats. But over the last month, support accelerated, resulting in 71 Democrats voting in favor, with support also coming from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIt is very gratifying that effective communication by the crypto community changed the politics in Washington to the point that elected Democrat leaders are now voting yes to laws that reverse the regime\u2019s hostile approach to this new asset class,\u201d Sigel says.\n\nFIT21 passing through the House flew in the face of Gensler\u2019s attempts to warn Democrats off it. \u201c[FIT21] would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,\u201d Gensler said in the statement released Wednesday.\n\nMoreover, over the past month Trump has also doubled down on his pro-crypto stance. On Tuesday, his presidential campaign said it would start to accept donations via any crypto asset accepted through Coinbase. \u201cBiden surrogate Elizabeth Warren said in an attack on cryptocurrency that she was building an \u2018anti-crypto army\u2019 to restrict Americans\u2019 right to make their own financial choices,\u201d the campaign said in the announcement, in reference to a reelection ad Warren posted on X last year. \u201cMAGA supporters, now with a new cryptocurrency option, will build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum heats up over key ETF decision. Here's what you need to know. - Mashable",
        "content": "Ethereum, the nerdy cryptocurrency that was lately overshadowed by Bitcoin, is in the news again, and the price is pumping. What gives?\n\nWell, only one of the most important developments in Ethereum's history, anon. An Ethereum spot ETF (Exchange Traded-Fund) might get approved in the U.S. today \u2014 that's Thursday, May 23.\n\nUPDATE: May. 24, 2024, 11:51 a.m. CEST The first Ethereum ETFs indeed got the nod from regulators on Thursday, though there's more steps and hoops to jump through (see part on the S-1 form below) before they can actually start trading.\n\nBefore we get into all that, here's a very short primer on Ethereum or ETH. Launched in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin and others, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin, and it has been so for the better part of the past five years or so.\n\nWhat is this Ethereum thing you speak of?\n\nEthereum is a very different beast from Bitcoin. The latter is a digital currency and a public ledger of transactions that uses a network of computers (miners) to securely verify every transaction in the system, as well as create new coins through a computing-intensive process called proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform for decentralized apps. Unlike Bitcoin, it uses proof-of-stake to power and secure the network, meaning there is no environmentally unfriendly mining, with validators using a stake of their ether or ETH (the underlying currency of the platform) to validate transactions. Also, unlike Bitcoin, which is all about the secure sending and receiving of bitcoins and fairly little else, Ethereum is a platform for other decentralized apps (also called smart contracts) to run on.\n\nAs you can imagine, this makes Ethereum more powerful than Bitcoin in a sense, but it also makes it more complicated, both in terms of usage and implications. These days, basically everyone \u2014 the likes of large banks and pensions funds included \u2014 understands Bitcoin to be a largely decentralized digital asset, which can be bought, securely stored and sold, akin to a digital version of gold. Ethereum is a lot more complicated, with the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) not being entirely clear on whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nAn ETH ETF is now a very real possibility\n\nThis leads us to the part about ETFs. In January 2024, after receiving the SEC's blessing, Bitcoin spot ETF funds started trading in the United States. This had immense implications as to who can buy Bitcoin; suddenly, a U.S. state pension fund or an investment fund was able to easily get exposure to Bitcoin without worrying about breaking some rule. And the \"spot\" part, in contrast to a futures ETF, means that the Bitcoin spot ETFs must buy actual Bitcoins when someone buys their product.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading... Sign Me Up By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\n\nThe interest was record-breaking, with more than $13 billion flowing into BTC via spot ETFs since their inception. And unsurprisingly, the price of Bitcoin soared from around $42,000 in early January to roughly $69,500 at writing time.\n\nMany of the same entities \u2014 large investment companies such as BlackRock, VanEck, and Ark \u2014 also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF, with deadlines for SEC's approval or denial starting on May 23. And up until a few days ago, analysts largely believed that the ETFs would be denied, given SEC's previous reluctance to provide clear guidance over whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nThis has changed. According to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas, there was \"chatter\" that the SEC has completely reversed its stance on Ethereum, followed by a slew of potential ETF issuers submitting amended 19b-4 forms to the SEC, signaling that there's a very good chance that the ETFs are on their way for approval.\n\nWe know, the sheer mention of something like a 19b-4 form made you fall asleep instantly. But we mention it because there's another set of forms that need to be approved, the S-1 forms, and those are key for actual ETF approval.\n\nIn practice, this means we could get a very good indication that one or more (probably more) Ethereum ETFs are coming, but it might take weeks or months before they actually start trading.\n\nAs a result of these filings, the price of Ethereum rose from around $3,100 to $3,800, where it's trading at writing time.\n\nOf course, nothing is official or set in stone. The Ethereum ETF applications could still get denied, though the consensus among experts is that it's now a question of when, not if, it will happen. A denial would surely be a cold shower for Ethereum's price, at least in the short term.\n\nThis is one of the most important developments for crypto, period\n\nThis is not just about Ethereum's price. This sudden change of sentiment by the SEC could mean that the U.S. government is suddenly far more open to everything crypto related. Indeed, an important crypto bill was just passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, despite the SEC head Gary Gensler having some very stern words about it.\n\nPerhaps the simplest of implications of this approval is other crypto spot ETFs getting the nod in the future. But with BlackRock launching a tokenized version of its money-market fund on Ethereum, it's getting easy to envision a future in which a big chunk of global finance exists on the blockchain. In other words, your nerdy, crypto-mining neighbor who told you that one day all of finance will roll into crypto, may have actually been right.\n\nWhat now?\n\nWell, unless you're a trader looking to capitalize on price moves, you don't really have to do anything. Regardless of whether the Ethereum spot ETF is denied, approved, or delayed today, Ethereum and its ecosystem of apps will keep trudging along.\n\nBut it is important to consider that a potential approval fully legitimizes an entire new class of crypto assets. Institutions, funds, banks, perhaps even pension funds, will be looking to get in on the action, and it could spark a thriving period for Ethereum, as well as the apps and assets that reside on it. After a bit of a lull in the past couple of years, the crypto space could once again become very exciting over the next couple of years."

        "content": "Increased odds of the SEC approving spot ether ETFs have led to a jump in Ethereum open interest and perpetual funding rates across the market, helping push the staking yield of USDe to 37.2%.\n\nEthena stakes ETH and earns a funding rate on crypto exchanges for opening short derivative positions to provide a yield for token holders of USDe that choose to stake Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar.\n\nEnthusiasm about the SEC potentially approving a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) has propelled the market cap of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar cryptocurrency USDe above $2.5 billion, following a surge in Ethereum open interest among exchanges and increased perpetual funding rates across the market.\n\nThe market cap of USDe hovered around $2.45 billion on May 20, before Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and Jeff Seyffart increased their odds of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approving a spot ether ETF to 75%. Since then, USDe\u2019s market cap has grown by $100 million in dollar terms, a 4% increase in the past three days, to $2.55 billion at presstime, data from CoinGecko shows.\n\nThe jump in USDe\u2019s market cap in part stems from Ethena\u2019s USDe staking yield becoming more attractive. Per Ethena\u2019s homepage, USDe\u2019s staking yield currently stands at 37.2%, a sharp rise from 27.55% on May 14.\n\nEthena\u2019s staking yield comes from the rewards from staking ETH and the funding rate earned by Ethena for opening short derivative positions.

        "title": "MIT Brothers Charged With Exploiting Ethereum to Steal $25 Million - Dark Reading",
        "content": "Many cryptocurrency traders play fast and loose with the systems in place to empower decentralized finance (DeFi), using a variety of hacks to gain an advantage in their trades \u2014 from sandwich attacks to rug pull scams \u2014 and losses typically run into the tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nYet, two traders \u2014 brothers who both graduated from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology \u2014 took their scheme too far, exploiting a vulnerability in a common component used by traders on the Etherium blockchain to score nearly $25 million in an attack that lasted 12 seconds, the US Department of Justice charged on May 16. The two brothers \u2014 Anton Peraire-Bueno of Boston and James Peraire-Bueno of New York \u2014 discovered the software flaw in 2022, prepared and planned the attacks for months, and then executed the theft in April 2023, law enforcement alleges.\n\nThe attack worried traders and technologists, calling \"the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" Damian Williams, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement from the Justice Department announcing the indictment.\n\n\"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe,\" he said. \"And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete. This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged.\"\n\nCryptocurrency has gained legitimacy over the past decade and a half, but continues to \u2014 in many ways \u2014 be a Wild West. In 2023, more than $24 billion in transactions ended up in illicit cryptocurrency wallets or addresses \u2014 although more than half of the total belonged to sanctioned organizations and nations, and the total rate of fraud is only 0.34%, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain intelligence firm.\n\nWhile ransomware gangs prefer Bitcoin, Ethereum has seen its fair share of attacks, from the $60 million DAO hack in 2016 that led to a hard fork \u2014 a rewriting of the Ethereum ledger \u2014 to the more than $600 million in Ethereum stolen from game players on the Ronin Network.\n\nIn many ways, the ecosystem behind cryptocurrencies is undergoing the growing pains that the Internet faced over the past three decades, says Oded Vanunu, chief technologist for Web 3.0 and head of product vulnerability research at cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies.\n\n\"It's crazy, because we are seeing tactics that are being done already in Web 2 platforms that are taking a different shape in the Web 3 protocols,\" he says.\n\nOf Mempools and Maximal Extractable Value\n\nCryptocurrency transfers, the proposal of a smart contract, and the execution of smart contracts are all transactions that are recorded on the blockchain \u2014 in Ethereum's case, a public distributed state machine. However, before being recorded, every transaction is placed in a memory pool, or mempool, pending its validation and execution, which typically takes a few steps.\n\nA participant in the ecosystem known as a \"block builder\" will create a bundle \u2014 or block \u2014 of transactions and get paid by the originator of each transaction for completion, while a \"block proposer\" chooses blocks based on the fees advertised by the builder, validates them, and sends those transactions to its peers on the blockchain network. Typically, a builder is attempting to structure blocks based on a strategy of maximal extractable value (MEV), seeking to maximize profits.\n\nDividing participants into proposers and builders \u2014 what's called a proposer-builder separation (PBS) \u2014 splits the responsibility of validating transactions to limit the monopolization of the process by large traders who could order transactions in specific ways to drive profits. MEV bots help traders identify and create bundles of transactions that maximize their profits from a transaction.\n\nYet, there is still a lot that traders can do to tilt the playing field. In a sandwich attack, for example, the trader profits from the natural price increases or decreases caused by large cryptocurrency transactions. When a large buy order appears, a builder could place a buy order for the cryptocurrency in front of the order, and a matching sell order after, profiting from the price change caused by the original buy order.\n\nFor many DeFi participants, MEV traders are little better than the equivalent of modern ticket scalpers, but they do serve a critical role, says Adam Hart, product manager at Chainalysis.\n\n\"To many, MEV strategies look like hyper-sophisticated, deep-pocketed traders using their resources to profit by forcing less sophisticated traders to take worse prices,\" he says. \"However, others argue that MEV is inevitable in an open, transparent blockchain network, and that MEV traders play a positive role by ensuring that arbitrage opportunities are exploited quickly so that asset prices remain aligned across protocols.\"\n\nAn Attack on MEV Traders\n\nThe Peraire-Bueno brothers discovered a vulnerability in an open source component of a common tool, known as a MEV-Boost relay, according to a postmortem analysis of the incident. MEV-Boost is a protocol for limiting the centralization of the two components of the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 proposers and builders \u2014 and the monopolization of profits, which historically could have resulted in a few players dominating the blockchain process.\n\nA key criteria of the MEV-Boost protocol is that the proposer commits to validating a block based on price, before knowing its contents. The brothers allegedly found that signing the header gave them the information in the block, even if the signature was invalid, the postmortem stated.\n\n\"The attack ... was possible because the exploited relay revealed block bodies to the proposer, so long as the proposer correctly signed a block header,\" the analysis stated. \"However, the relay did not check if the block header that was signed was valid.\"\n\nWhile the vulnerability could have continued to cause problems for traders, this was not an attack on the Ethereum network or its validators directly, but rather on a specific \u2014 albeit, common \u2014 third-party component, says Mario Rivas, blockchain security global practice lead at NCC Group.\n\n\"The attack exploited a vulnerability in the relay's code, which caused the relay to send private transactions to the block builder when it signed a block with invalid headers,\" he says. \"This vulnerability was promptly addressed, mitigating the risk of similar attacks unless other vulnerabilities are identified.\"\n\nLaw Enforcement Tallies Up a Win\n\nThe investigation and indictment, however, is a win for the DOJ. US law enforcement is increasingly cracking down on cryptocurrency scams, hacking, and other questionable practices. In August, for example, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged a correctional officer for creating a worthless cryptocurrency and selling it to other members of law enforcement.\n\nYet, other attacks have remained below the threshold for legal action. In a 2021 attack, for example, one trader acknowledged selling a non-liquid token to a rival \u2014 in something referred to as a Salmonella attack \u2014 and making money off his rival's automated system buying the worthless coin, according to a Forbes report.\n\nThe alleged attack by the two brothers stands apart from those contentious tactics, says Check Point's Vanunu.\n\n\"In essence, while both types of attacks are harmful, the MIT brothers' actions were explicitly illegal due to their direct and unauthorized exploitation of vulnerabilities to steal funds, whereas [a] Salmonella attack leverage[s] market manipulation and deception, staying within the murkier boundaries of legality in the crypto world,\" he says.\n\nThe investigation of the scheme and subsequent indictment underscores that government officials and their private partners are keeping pace with the latest innovative attacks. Despite the sophistication of the exploit and laundering of the proceeds, the investigators traced the funds, identified two suspects, and made their arrests, Chainalysis' Hart says.\n\n\"The Peraire-Bueno brothers' exploit is an incredibly innovative, technically sophisticated attack, and it represents the first time a bad actor has managed to abuse the MEV system widely used by Ethereum block builders in this way and to this degree,\" he says. \"That\u2019s what makes this indictment so impressive, and a promising sign for the future in the fight against cryptocurrency-based crime.\""

        "title": "SEC paves way for ethereum ETFs in boost for crypto - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has paved the way for the potential launch of eight exchange traded funds tied to the world\u2019s second-largest digital coin, following the regulator\u2019s approval of the first bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThe regulator on Thursday approved rule changes in support of ETFs that invest in ether, the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum blockchain, for several groups including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and Ark Invest. A second round of approvals will be needed before the products can launch.\n\nWidespread anticipation of the approvals has sent ether\u2019s price soaring more than 20 per cent since Monday and more than 60 per cent year-to-date.\n\nIt is a significant regulatory shift for the SEC after months of silence on the issue. On Monday the SEC suddenly gave feedback to issuers and exchanges on the pending applications, sparking a flurry of paperwork and revisions. The SEC had faced deadlines of Thursday and Friday to respond to ether ETF applications from VanEck and Ark, respectively, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cThis is a key step to offering Ethereum access through the ETF structure, which will offer US investors easier access, higher protection and safeguards,\u201d Invesco and Galaxy, a digital assets group, said in a statement on Thursday evening. \u201cWe hope this approval indicates a willingness by the SEC to approve the launch of these products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most of us were resigned to a disapproval order coming down the pike,\u201d said Katherine Dowling, general counsel for Bitwise Asset Management, one of 11 US bitcoin ETF issuers and which has filed to launch an ether ETF.\n\nIt is unclear if and when the SEC will grant the second round of approvals needed before the products can launch.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler on Thursday morning explained his reticence to allowing crypto investment products to launch on the US market at an Investment Company Institute conference. He alluded to the myriad fraud cases that have affected the crypto industry, such as that of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who in March was sentenced to 25 years in prison in connection with the billions of dollars that went missing from his cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to the rampant non-compliance with US law,\u201d Gensler told ICI chief executive Eric Pan. \u201cIt comes down to the frauds and scams. This is a field where some of the leading lights of the field are either now in jail, awaiting jail, awaiting extradition.\u201d\n\nThe SEC last year lost a court battle with Grayscale Investments over the asset manager\u2019s push to convert its flagship bitcoin trust into an ETF. After that decision, the regulator \u2014 with apparent reluctance \u2014 approved Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin product and 10 other new ETF launches earlier this year."

        "content": "Update, May 23, 2024: This story has been updated with additional information about the approvals.\n\nKey Takeaways The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule change allowing for the listing and trading of eight spot Ether exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe approval doesn\u2019t allow the ETFs to immediately begin trading, as the SEC will still need to review individual applications from asset managers for each of the eight ETFs that were given initial approval Thursday. That process could take several weeks.\n\nThis is a win for the crypto industry, which has been hoping for the approval of ether ETFs since a similar product for bitcoin was approved at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday approved applications for the listing of eight spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, though further approvals are necessary before you can start trading them.\n\n\n\nWhen Will Ether ETFs Begin Trading?\n\nAccording to a memo from the regulator, NYSE Arca has been authorized to list the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF; Nasdaq will list the iShares Ethereum Trust; and CBOE BZX will list the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and the Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nVanEck immediately followed the SEC's announcement with an S-1 filing, indicating that their product was ready to launch. The S-1 approval process, in which regulators will look at the specific ETFs themselves, could take weeks but some analysts say that process may be fast-tracked.\n\nSEC Comes Around Despite Concerns\n\nConcerns around whether ether is a security and staking were two major reasons why the SEC was reluctant to give a green light to ether ETFs. While many market participants say today's decision indirectly implies ether is not a security, the issues around staking were resolved when ETF issuers removed it from their applications.\n\nSome analysts said the White House's softened stance on crypto helped move the SEC toward approval. Additionally, a bipartisan group of lawmakers urged the SEC to approve the ETFs in a letter to the regulators.\n\nSince the January approval of spot bitcoin (BTC), markets have closely watched the approval process for similar funds for the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network. That has created a runup in the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is up 60% year-to-date. Ether was up almost 2% on the day as the SEC made its announcement.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated with the correct number of spot Ether ETFs that have been approved for listing."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of Ethereum has has largely remained flat following the historic approval of eight spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that give investors exposure to the second-biggest digital asset by market cap.\n\nEthereum's price hit $3,856 within minutes of the confirmed approval, per data from CoinGecko, then dipped down to $3,771. It's up to $3,825 as of this writing, but so far, the moves have been relatively minuscule.\n\nETH is up a little more than 1% on the day, but over the past seven days, the asset is up a massive 30%.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been quiet on the products for months, leading industry observers and analysts to expect the regulator to say no to them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut things changed this week when rumors dropped claiming that the SEC was expected to say yes to the funds. Fund managers started refiling paperwork and making amendments to important forms\u2014signs that the products were about to be approved.\n\nAnd today, they got the green light. The products allow ordinary investors to buy shares that trade on a stock exchange and track the price of the digital asset.\n\nEthereum\u2014and other digital coins and tokens\u2014can be daunting for traditional investors to buy, sell, and store.

        "title": "Is Ethereum a security or commodity? Why does it matter and will an ETF change this? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The ongoing debate over Ethereum\u2019s classification in the United States is garnering significant attention at the moment due to actions by the SEC and a possible ETF approval. The distinction between commodities and securities holds substantial implications for the regulation and future of crypto. If Ethereum were officially recognized as a commodity, the crypto landscape could witness transformative shifts in regulatory oversight, market participation, and investment vehicles.\n\nCommodity vs security definitions\n\nIn the US, a commodity is generally defined as a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type. This category includes items like gold, oil, and agricultural products. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates commodities, focusing on market stability and fraud prevention. Conversely, a security represents an ownership position in a publicly traded corporation via stock, a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation via bond, or rights to ownership as represented by an option. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities, emphasizing investor protection and disclosure requirements.\n\nEthereum\u2019s classification has been a contentious issue. In 2018, the CFTC asserted jurisdiction over Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, classifying them as commodities. The SEC, however, has historically been more cautious. In 2018, SEC Director William Hinman suggested that Ethereum, which had initially been funded through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), might not be a security due to its decentralized nature. Despite this, the lack of a definitive classification has left Ethereum in a regulatory gray area.\n\nHow would classifying Ethereum a commodity change things?\n\nThe potential recognition of Ethereum as a commodity would have several implications. Firstly, it would place Ethereum under the purview of the CFTC, which could lead to more consistent regulatory guidelines. This shift could reduce the regulatory uncertainty that currently hampers some institutional investors, thereby encouraging broader participation in the Ethereum market. Moreover, it could pave the way for new financial products, such as Ethereum futures and options, thereby enhancing market liquidity and stability.\n\nA significant development that could influence Ethereum\u2019s classification is the approval of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. They hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and typically operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur. In the context of Ethereum, an ETF would provide a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors alike. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US has already set a precedent as it is designated a commodity ETF.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF could bolster arguments for its classification as a commodity. The successful launch of a Bitcoin ETF has demonstrated to regulators that digital assets can be integrated into traditional financial systems in a regulated and secure manner. An Ethereum ETF would likely undergo rigorous scrutiny, ensuring that all compliance and security measures are in place. This process could further validate Ethereum\u2019s status as a commodity by showcasing its stability and maturity as an asset class.\n\nRecognizing Ethereum as a commodity would not only clarify its regulatory status but also enhance its appeal to a broader range of investors. Institutional interest in crypto is growing, driven by the desire for portfolio diversification and hedging against inflation. Clear regulatory guidelines would mitigate the risks associated with regulatory uncertainty, making Ethereum a more attractive investment.\n\nAdditionally, this recognition could spur innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. With regulatory clarity, developers and businesses could engage in more ambitious projects without the fear of unexpected legal repercussions. This could accelerate the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s role in the broader digital economy.\n\nUltimately, the official recognition of Ethereum as a commodity would mark a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It would streamline regulatory oversight, enhance market participation, and foster innovation. The potential approval of an Ethereum ETF could play a crucial role in this process, demonstrating Ethereum\u2019s viability as a stable and mature asset. However, it would not be an official settle the debate regarding Ethereum being a commodity unless additional specific classifications were issued by the SEC."

        "content": "What will an Ethereum ETF mean for the markets?\n\nGalaxy\u2019s Mike Novogratz and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin are among experts weighing in.\n\nEthereum shot up this week amid a swing to optimism about US approval for exchange-traded funds that track the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe reasoning behind the sudden U-turn is up for debate, but market watchers are generally aligned on what a regulator nod would do for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAsset manager VanEck is the first Ethereum ETF application on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s pile, due May 23.\n\nHere\u2019s what experts are saying.\n\nGalaxy\u2019s Mike Novogratz\n\nA \u201cwidespread\u201d pivot in Washington in the last 24 hours just upended the Ethereum ETF game, said Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.\n\nIf the SEC\u2019s change of heart was politically motivated, \u201cthat\u2019s a seismic shift,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what actually happened, prices are going to be much higher than here.\u201d\n\nConsensys\u2019 Joe Lubin\n\nExpect a \u201cfloodgate\u201d of demand for Ether, which will likely lead to a supply crunch and drive prices higher, says Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of crypto infrastructure firm Consensys.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nInstitutions that have already gained exposure to Bitcoin ETFs \u201cwill most likely want to diversify into that second approved ETF,\u201d Lubin told DL News.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether\u201d via ETFs, he said. He added the caveat that there will be less supply to accommodate that demand than when the spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January.\n\nBitwise\u2019s Matt Hougan\n\n\u201dCrypto is in the process of going mainstream, and that this progress will push crypto to all-time highs,\u201d Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan wrote in a blog post this week.\n\nBut Hougan suggested that the catalyst was not the sudden optimism on ETFs.\n\n\u201dSomething remarkable happened in Washington: A bipartisan group of senators and representatives passed the first pro-crypto piece of legislation in Washington\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the bill to repeal the SEC\u2019s SAB 121 policy that imposed strict rules on crypto custody.\n\n\u201cThis newfound support for crypto in DC \u2014 whether we get the spot Ethereum approval or not \u2014 is the latest proof point,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nSwarm\u2019s Timo Lehes\n\nTimo Lehes, co-founder of blockchain platform Swarm, sees \u201csignificant inflows of capital\u201d into Ethereum once an ETF is approved.\n\n\u201cOnce you have allocated to Bitcoin, you also look to something else as part of portfolio diversification,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cNaturally, investors choose eth, as the next largest crypto asset.\u201d\n\nWhile inflows will probably pale in comparison to those for Bitcoin\u2019s ETF when it launched in January, \u201cit will still be enough to move the dial on its price action.\u201d\n\nKaiko\n\nOptions traders who have \u201ccrowded around\u201d bullish options are now looking at gains, said Adam McCarthy, an analyst at Kaiko.\n\nBut investors should be cautious, Kaiko said: \u201cHong Kong ETFs didn\u2019t see much demand and have had mixed days with several net outflow days already. No staking is a big factor too, and likely impacts demand further.\u201d\n\nHe suggested watching Grayscale\u2019s $9 billion ETHE product, \u201cif it suffers large outflows, that would be significant for prices.\u201d\n\nBernstein\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF will drive a 75% surge to $6,600, according to estimates made by Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra, analysts at research firm Bernstein.\n\nThey noted that the SEC\u2019s approval of similar Bitcoin products in January spurred a 75% rally in the following weeks.\n\n\u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH,\u201d Chhugani and Sapra said in a report this week."

        "content": "Numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a boon for the market. The first day of trading in the US saw over $4.6 billion in volume. Within a month, bitcoin rose above $50,000 for the first time since the bear market and hit $70,000 in March for the first time ever.\n\nBut this bitcoin ETF liquidity boost does not address any of the underlying issues in today\u2019s crypto user experience, nor does it offer investors empowerment through self-custody.\n\nIn the case of ethereum ETFs, the outcome will likely be the same. Rather than rely on regulatory approval of such financial products to welcome traditional investors onboard, our industry needs to reimagine how we approach digital asset management so that users don\u2019t need to choose between convenience and financial freedom.\n\nWhat interest in ETFs really tell us\n\nThe appeal of ETFs is exposure to the crypto market without the hassle of digital asset custody. With over 900,000 ETH forever lost due to user error, it\u2019s understandable that investors would look for easier ways to tap into the value created in this space.\n\nBut using old-world instruments to address crypto\u2019s user experience challenges goes against what this industry set out to do \u2014 transform existing financial infrastructure to empower the little guy.\n\nAfter years of being looked down on by Wall Street, ETFs are tacit acknowledgments by traditional investors that the crypto sector is something worth opening the floodgates of retail and non-crypto money into. Supposing that ethereum ETF approval generates further interest in the crypto space \u2014 be that bullish interest from Larry Fink at BlackRock, opposition from ECB director generals, or just curiosity from the trainer at my local gym \u2014 the opportunity lies in shepherding these new investors toward full ownership of their assets.\n\nThe ETF wrapper is one means of entry into crypto as an asset, but removing the wrapper brings us to the real treat \u2014 true ownership.\n\nNewfound industry attention, now to trust ourselves\n\nWhy should individuals care about self-custody and financial freedom? While the answer may be obvious to those deeply embedded in the crypto community, trusting traditional banks is the norm, and the convenience brought by these institutions outweighs the risks of crypto for many individuals.\n\nWhen the Bitcoin white paper was published 15 years ago, the manifesto envisioned a peer-to-peer network without financial intermediaries. Ethereum then brought new functionality to the digital asset space and created the foundation for DeFi innovation. For the first time, individuals could harness digital ownership and exchange assets globally online while preserving personal privacy and autonomy.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: BlackRock and other bitcoin ETFs rob bitcoin of its room to grow\n\nThe challenge now is to get people of all investment experience and levels involved directly through self-custody of their assets. Products like ETFs, which mirror instruments in the traditional finance space, may have a positive market impact. However, they do not push individuals to reconsider traditional financial hierarchies and take ownership into their own hands. Only by directly engaging in self-custody platforms will we see crypto values influence mainstream audiences.\n\nWe\u2019re only as good as our infrastructure\n\nSelf-custody is important, but how are we going to convince the next billion users to value freedom over convenience? It\u2019s obvious that seed phrases and hardware wallets are not going to unlock digital ownership for mainstream users. In a time where payments can be made with a tap of a phone or a watch, the crypto industry needs usable features to appeal to traditional investors and everyday users.\n\nThat\u2019s why Vitalik and other leaders in the Ethereum space are calling for a transition to smart accounts. By abstracting away the complexities of digital asset management, smart accounts enable features like crypto recovery, self-custodial debit cards and email login. In addition to smart accounts, improvements in scaling tools like zero-knowledge (zk) rollups have increased the capacity and throughput of DeFi applications, overcoming bottlenecks and preparing the industry for mainstream adoption.\n\nBetter features and scalability have paved the way for new use cases in crypto. Self-custody is no longer limited to individual asset management. With multi-signature accounts, for example, organizations and businesses can co-manage assets with ease. Further, developments in zk have reduced transaction fees, making it feasible for projects to facilitate large batches of transactions cost-effectively.\n\nThe crypto industry needs to continue building momentum\n\nBitcoin and ethereum ETFs have captured the zeitgeist, and now the crypto industry needs to capitalize on the mindshare introduced by this regulatory milestone. In the same way that football\u2019s popularity grew in my German hometown in the aftermath of Germany\u2019s 2014 FIFA World Cup victory, this newfound interest among conventional investors allows us to push self-custody to the forefront and showcase the opportunities unlocked by digital ownership.\n\nETFs encourage adoption; true crypto ownership encourages autonomy. Simplifying crypto user experience should be championed above simple ETF wrappers and commodity baskets. Bolstered with new liquidity, the industry needs to use this pivotal moment as a catalyst to revamp user experience across the board. Improving crypto-native platforms progresses the movement for digital ownership, which will outlast any market trends in the coming years.\n\nJulian Grigo is the Head of Institutions at Safe.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared that an approval movement \u201cis happening,\u201d despite regulatory indicators pointing out to the contrary direction until Monday.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) leaped up to 21% in less than 48 hours and stood just 22% from its all-time high of $4,878.26, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. Bitcoin (BTC) leaped 96% in two months before the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and reached its all-time high two months later.\n\nJames Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s case was different. \u201cIn that instance, though, everything came together \u2013 ETFs, bitcoin halving, and global inflation easing significantly \u2013 and lined up to drive Bitcoin. Ethereum has already had the crypto cycle and global market sentiment increase,\u201d he shares.\n\nAlthough Davies sees Ethereum ETF inflows having a substantial impact, propelling ETH to new all-time highs, it may be hard for Ethereum to replicate BTC\u2019s movement after the funds\u2019 approval. \u201cIt does, however, present a great steady growth story for the rest of 2024.\u201d\n\nRuslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, also shares the view that an Ethereum ETF might trigger a sharp ETH price increase. Moreover, this movement might not be fully priced, with significant upside yet to be seen. \u201cIf so, it will be a powerful impetus for the whole crypto market and a stimulus for other coins\u2019 growth,\u201d added Lienkha.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s analysts believe that a spot Ethereum ETF approval could play out just like the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, which was \u201ca sell-the-news event before a long-term bullish outlook was triggered, causing a multi-month rally.\u201d As for inflows, they expect a similar level compatible with ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe current move from sub $3000 to $3800 is a result of the market pricing in the higher odds of an ETF approval. It is important that market participants often front-run and price in odds as absolute \u2013 implying that 75% odds of approval by Bloomberg analysts could potentially be priced in as 100%.\n\nMarko Jurina CEO at Jumper.Exchange, pointed out that BTC rose nearly 65% following the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Thus, a similar movement would propel ETH \u201cwell beyond its previous all-time high.\u201d Zentner also believes that the approval might trigger a crypto market growth for the second half of 2024.\n\nWhat if\u2026?\n\nDespite the optimism regarding the Ethereum ETF approval, there is still a slight chance of rejection. Moreover, as highlighted by Seyffart, a good part of investors are misunderstanding the current movement since approval doesn\u2019t translate to immediate trading. Both of these scenarios might then upset investors.\n\nNevertheless, in the light of recent developments, those events are now being priced out, says James Davies, from Crypto Valley Exchange. On the other hand, Jumper.Exchange\u2019s Marko Jurina believes that both negative possible events are already priced in.\n\n\u201cWhen the spot BTC ETFs first came to market, there was actually a brief sell-off where some took profits before the rally resumed. Additionally, given the volatile nature of the market, good and bad news gives ample opportunity for market makers to create more violent price swings, so blood on the streets is definitely possible. More problematic for the ETH community (if no approval) would be the loss of a narrative as a catalyst,\u201d Jurina added.\n\nMoreover, a slight drop followed by a consolidation period is also a possibility, shares Ruslan Lienkha from YouHodler. \u201cEthereum ETF approval is just a matter of time. The SEC will approve it sooner or later after the status clarification of ETH, and it matters little if it is recognized as a commodity, security, or something else. As for now, fundamentally, nothing will change for ETH. It will remain the second crypto in the industry even without ETFs.\u201d\n\nEven if an unlikely rejection happens, Bitfinex analysts describe a \u2018layered\u2019 scenario, which could end in a \u201chard rejection\u201d or a \u201csoft rejection.\u201d A hard rejection would include ETH being considered a security, while a soft rejection would be limited to ETF proposals.\n\n\u201cThe former could be very bearish leading to a retrace of the entire move up currently. The latter could lead to more speculation continuing over a future approval on re-appeal,\u201d Bitfinex analysts concluded."

        "content": "Ethereum drops nearly 5% in an hour, suspected MEV manipulation by Symbolic Capital Partners.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum (ETH) faced a nearly 5% crash in one hour this Thursday, despite the anticipation around the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. The X user identified as ai_9684xtpa pointed out that this was likely a market manipulation movement by the trading firm Symbolic Capital Partners.\n\n\u201cThe agency sold 6,968 ETH in one minute at 20:56, worth $27.38 million, with an average selling price of $3,930; one transaction sold 3,497 ETH on the chain at one time, and the bribe cost was as high as 90 ETH,\u201d explained ai_9684xtpa.\n\nSuch transactions are known as MEV, short for \u201cmaximal extractable value,\u201d which consists of using on-chain resources to profit. The payment of 90 ETH suggests a hurry to sell the position at a higher price to make it crash, possibly to buy it again at a lower price.\n\nETH price fluctuation after Symbolic\u2019s transaction. Image: CoinGecko\n\nSince the crash, Ethereum has ranged in and out of the $3,800 price level and is priced at $3,803.37 at the time of writing, nearly 22% away from its previous all-time high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening\u201d\n\nAs shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, an approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is happening this Thursday. Despite the low odds given to this scenario until last Monday, Seyffart and his fellow Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas boosted the chances to 75% after the SEC started contacting the issuers.\n\nSince then, various asset management firms presented amends to their 19b-4 filings, and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF even got listed on DTCC under the ticker $ETHV. The first final deadline is today, as the US regulator must decide on VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nMoreover, according to Balchunas, the SEC\u2019s decision on spot Ethereum ETFs might come at 4 pm (EST). Although a positive outcome is expected, it doesn\u2019t mean immediate permission for trading."

        "content": "A lot of excitement and speculation surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts are predicting that if this approval happens, Ether could surge as high as $6,600.\n\nThe estimations come from analysts at the research firm, Bernstein, Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra. They pointed out that a 75% increase in value occurred in the weeks that followed the SEC\u2019s approval of comparable Bitcoin WTFs in January.\n\nEthereum surged past $6,600 on speculation of SEC approval for ETFs, with a 22% increase in the last 24 hours, surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s 4.5% rise. At the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price has dropped to $3,694. Its previous record was $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nIn research released on Tuesday, Chhugani and Sapra stated, \u201cWe would expect similar price action for ETH.\u201d Two prominent Bloomberg Intelligence analysts created a stir on Monday when they increased the likelihood that an ETH ETF will be approved from 25% to 75%.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, analysts for Bloomberg Intelligence, said they revised their forecast for the ETF in response to rumors that the SEC was talking to exchanges more frequently. As previous, analysts have expressed it appears that the US\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is at a standstill.\n\nPotential SEC approval of Ethereum ETFs could take two steps: first, the ETF would need to be approved in theory, but the products wouldn\u2019t actually be sold in the market until after that. Observers of the market have interpreted this distinction favorably.\n\nConfusion has spread throughout the market as a result of the uncertainties surrounding ETF clearance, especially on prediction sites like Polymarket where users have staked $8 million on the result. Existing bets may become more complex if a two-step approval process is implemented.\n\nDuring these changes, Bitcoin has increased by 4.5% and passed over $70,000 in the last day, while Ethereum has gained 22% to $3,790. With ramifications for other applicants as well, the market is eager to see the SEC\u2019s ruling on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposal."

BLK and five other issuers have recently amended their ETF filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and VanEck's ETF has already been listed by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\nThis has led analysts to believe that an approval is highly likely, with trading expected to commence as early as next week.\n\nMarko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, said, \"If the BTC ETF approval was any indication, we could see a similar 60% rally from here.\"\n\nQCP Asia\u2019s trade idea further supports this optimistic outlook.\n\nThe likelihood of ETH ETF approval under SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2018s tenure appears strong.\n\nBoth Jurina and James Davies, co-founder and CPO at Crypto Valley Exchange, note that recent regulatory developments, such as minor requested changes to 19b-4 forms, suggest that approval is imminent.\n\n\"Everyone sees that ETH ETFs will pass very soon,\" said Davies. \"The SEC is following its pre-approval process, asking submitters to make minor changes to their applications, which they would not do if this was clearly not passing.\"\n\nIn the event of a denial, the most probable outcome would be a series of lawsuits, similar to the reaction following the initial rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nApplicants would likely challenge the SEC\u2019s decision in court.\n\nDavies explained, \"If BTC ETF approval story is informative, we will likely get ETH ETF approval as a result of legal challenges.\"\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Notch $154M Inflows As Popular Bitcoiner Slams Ethereum: \u2018A Speculative Platform For Gambling\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: The approval of ETH ETFs holds significant relevance as it would enhance the credibility of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\"ETFs increase the level of credibility of the industry, given that the SEC is giving a stamp of approval,\" noted Jurina.\n\nThis would attract larger funds and institutional investors who have been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties, potentially leading to substantial capital inflows and bolstering Ethereum's market position.\n\nWhile the approval of ETH ETFs could pave the way for other crypto asset ETFs, analysts like Davies believe that Ethereum\u2019s unique status in the industry makes it an outlier.\n\n\"The broader adoption of ETFs for other digital assets would require significant market infrastructure development,\" said Davies.\n\n\"We need to see places to instantly hedge other tokens in a cost-effective manner, with depth, to enable ETF providers to manage risks.\"\n\nIf ETH ETFs are approved, the repercussions for the ETH token price could be substantial.\n\n\"The market is not anticipating a rejection,\" Jurina commented, indicating that political ramifications could also arise if the SEC were to deny the applications at this stage.\n\n\"Household names have filed for ETFs and committed significant capital to their building. If the SEC were to reject at this late stage, it would be a shock and create political repercussions, which it is apparent Biden would not want to see at the present moment.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: For those looking to stay ahead of these developments and gain deeper insights into the future of digital assets, Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will be a crucial gathering.\n\nIndustry leaders and investors will converge to discuss the regulatory landscape, investment strategies, and the evolving digital asset market, providing a comprehensive overview of what lies ahead in this dynamic field.\n\nRead Next: VanEck\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF Listed On DTCC As SEC Decision Looms\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

This development comes shortly after Cboe released amended 19b-4 forms.\n\nWhile the DTCC listing is a crucial step for the ETF, it does not guarantee the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval, which is still pending.\n\nVanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application will likely be the first to get a decision from the SEC. The SEC will decide whether to deny or approve the product.\n\nVan Eck filed for a spot Ethereum ETF in September 2023. Many other industry giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity also followed suit.\n\nThe outlook for Ethereum-based funds was previously not promising as people involved in conversations with the SEC stated that there was an ongoing lack of engagement.\n\nHowever, things started to take a turn just a few days before the May 23 verdict. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate there is now a 75% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. They cite staking removal and political issues as the key drivers.\n\nStandard Chartered is also confident in the regulatory approval potential of the spot Ethereum ETF. Additionally, the bank is bullish on Ethereum\u2019s price, projecting that it is on track to hit $8,000 by year-end.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has shown impressive performance following positive developments in the Ethereum ETF. Ethereum surged 8% after Bloomberg analysts raised the odds and extended its rally, breaking through its $3,500 key level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,700, up 31% in the last 7 days."

This is a clear and meaningful catalyst for the overall sector and could lead to other similar products down the line.\n\nLet's dive into each of these tokens and what to watch in the week ahead.\n\nAre spot Ethereum ETFs coming?\n\nSome level of uncertainty remains on the ultimate decision from regulators for both the VanEck spot Ethereum application (due sometime later today) and the ARK 21Shares ETF application due tomorrow. Earlier this week, expectations were that we wouldn't hear anything until next week at the soonest. Accordingly, with the timeline moved up, investors will soon see whether these bullish bets were correct.\n\nPotential capital flow into Ethereum could disrupt inflows into Bitcoin-focused spot ETF funds. Thus, the price action we're seeing with Bitcoin heading into this announcement isn't surprising. Ethereum's gain should (at least somewhat) be Bitcoin's loss, though it's worth noting that Bitcoin has still trended positively on this news, since it's good for the broader sector.\n\nDogecoin's price action appears to be relatively detached from the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. That said, expectations of greater liquidity in this space courtesy of institutional investors have traders ramping up on more-speculative bets to capture the maximum amount of upside today.\n\nWhere to go from here\n\nPersonally, I think the safest place to be right now when it comes to these top digital assets is on the sidelines. Yes, there's some major upside potential should the SEC rule in favor of spot Ethereum ETFs. But I think the downside risk of a \"no\" could outweigh any future gains (and to be sure, a lot has already been priced in).\n\nVarious regulators have displayed different levels of enthusiasm for these spot Ethereum ETF products, so the outcome remains uncertain. Until we have an approval on the books, this is a catalyst I don't think is worth trading on right now."

        "content": "Ethereum Records Largest Daily Gains In 3 Years, Flips Mastercard And LVMH In Market Cap\n\nOn Monday afternoon, news broke that the probability of the SEC at least partially approving a spot ethereum ETF had vastly increased. This immediately led to massive buying activity for ETH, sending the price from less than $3,100 to over $3,800 in 24 hours. This marked the largest daily move for ETH since May 2021.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\nThe move followed a post on X from Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, who has been covering crypto ETFs for several months. The post detailed how he is raising the \"odds of spot Ether ETF approval to 75% (up from 25%), hearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they\u2019d be denied).\"\n\nThe post has amassed nearly five million views at the time of writing and was one of the first to start the frenzy surrounding the spot ETH ETFs. The announcement was highly unforeseen, as many had written off the ETFs due to the SEC's lack of comment on the issue and final deadlines for a decision looming later this week.\n\nTrending: According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\nThis news further enabled ethereum to reach a market cap of over $450 billion, making it larger than all but 20 companies worldwide. Here are some of the companies that ethereum surpassed after the news:\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nLVMH (LVMUY)\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG)\n\nSamsung (KRW)\n\nBank of America (BOA)\n\nHowever, approval of ETFs is not as black and white as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" from the SEC because two forms must be approved for the ETFs to go live. The 19b-4 form allows the funds to list the ETFs, while the S-1 form is a detailed account of how the ETFs would work. According to ETF analyst Nate Geraci, the SEC could greenlight the 19b-4 forms but delay a decision on the S-1s. This would give them time to take a closer look at the individual applications from different sponsors to understand what a launch would look like.\n\nIf this were to happen, it would be a positive for the spot ETFs and ethereum. It would allow the applications to move into the next stage of the process and one step closer to launch. Additionally, the possibility of full approval of the 19b-4s and S-1s is still on the table.\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts believe that a spot ETF approval would propel ETH to a price above $4,000, with some predicting that ETH could set new ATHs above $4,900. Given that Bitcoin hit new highs after the approval of its ETFs, a similar trend could occur for ethereum.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum Records Largest Daily Gains In 3 Years, Flips Mastercard And LVMH In Market Cap originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Decision Recalls Spot Bitcoin Launch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency\n\nRemember the spot bitcoin ETF launch?\n\nAs the spot Ethereum ETF approval drama unfolds, investors and exchange-traded fund industry observers can recall parallels between this case and events leading to the eventual approval and unveiling of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn both cases, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially exhibited caution toward approving spot ETFs for these cryptocurrencies. However, pressure from various stakeholders, including issuers, investors and the maturing crypto market, spurred a potential shift toward approval.\n\nBoth decisions reflect growing recognition of the maturing cryptocurrency market and rapidly increasing institutional interest in these assets.\n\nThe presence of spot bitcoin ETFs and the potential approval of an ether-based ETF suggest the SEC is considering the growing demand from investors for regulated ways to gain exposure to these cryptocurrencies.\n\nA key difference between the two cases is that the Ethereum ETF approval process may be faster than bitcoin's due to the legal precedent set by the August 2023 Grayscale court case, which effectively reversed the SEC\u2019s initial rejection of the asset manager's spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nBoth cases highlight the complex path to approval and greater receptivity toward well-structured spot cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nIs a Dogecoin ETF Next?\n\nIn the first two days of trading this week, the popular cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 9% as investors began to speculate that the largest meme coin by market cap could be the next for a spot ETF approval.\n\nCrypto trader Andrew Kang tweeted to his 244,000 followers on X Tuesday, \u201cthe odds for a DOGE ETF look brighter than ever.\u201d\n\nWhile speculation over more spot ETFs is not surprising, it would be surprising if a spot DOGE ETF was next in line.\n\nCryptocurrencies with clear and demonstrably valuable use cases beyond speculation might be viewed more favorably. Additionally, a well-developed ecosystem with robust infrastructure for secure storage and transactions could be a plus. Widespread acceptance, measured by larger market capitalization (total value of all outstanding coins) and higher trading volume (liquidity) may also be considerations.\n\nFor example, there are five cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and ether that have larger market caps than Dogecoin, according to data from CoiMnarketCap.com.\n\nBehind Bitcoin and Ethereum, these are the largest cryptocurrencies on the market:\n\nTether USDt (USDT): This stablecoin, with a market cap of roughly $111 billion, is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is a popular choice for investors seeking stability within the crypto market.\n\nBNB (BNB): The native coin of the Binance ecosystem, BNB, has a market cap of around $91 billion and is used for various purposes within the Binance exchange and its blockchain applications.\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana, known for its fast transaction processing speeds, currently has a market cap of approximately $80 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the spot Bitcoin ETF launches and increasingly likely spot Ethereum approvals are positive developments, but they don't guarantee a flood of spot ETFs for more cryptocurrencies. The SEC will likely continue cautiously, prioritizing established cryptocurrencies with well-structured ETF proposals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved"

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated discussions regarding S-1 registration statements with potential Ethereum ETF issuers. This development comes as amended 19b-4 forms have been submitted, although progress on S-1 forms has been minimal.\n\nA senior executive at an issuing firm revealed that these discussions are in the early stages. \u201cIt feels like the Division of Investment Management was somewhat caught off-guard by this shift. So, it\u2019s just starting,\u201d the source commented. Still, there is cautious optimism that the Ethereum ETF will move forward.\n\nFor Ethereum ETFs to be approved, the SEC is supposed to approve the 19b-4 forms, followed by the S-1 registration statements becoming effective. Only then can trading start. Typically, these forms undergo multiple amendments before final approval.\n\nWhile there has been significant movement on the 19b-4 forms, only Fidelity has recently filed an amended S-1 form. With discussions now beginning on the S-1s, further amendments are expected.\n\nThe SEC faces a crucial deadline today to approve or deny VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF 19b-4 form. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas anticipates a decision around 4 p.m., noting that past announcements have varied slightly in timing.\n\nHowever, even with 19b-4 form approvals, the S-1 forms take a long time to complete and approve for use, which can result in a slight delay in trading. Recently, BlackRock and Grayscale submitted their 19b-4 amendments and products related to the spot Ethereum ETFs."

        "content": "Europe has many crypto exchange-traded products on the market.\n\nThe UK launched an Ethereum ETP this week.\n\nEuropean investors aren\u2019t that interested in crypto ETPs.\n\nIn the US, the crypto industry is buzzing in anticipation ahead of an expected approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds.\n\nBut nations across the Atlantic are already miles ahead with similar crypto investment products.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange, for one, will begin handling Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded products for the first time by the end of May.\n\nNumerous ETPs\n\nAnd in Europe, there are already multiple Ethereum financial products, or ETPs, on the market. They include exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded commodities, which operate in similar ways to ETFs.\n\nBut the products, which have been on the market for years, haven\u2019t caught much steam. That\u2019s because Europeans are less keen on risky investments and prefer stability, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about where\u2019s the alpha going to come from, it\u2019ll be the place with the deeper capital markets and more eager investor base driving the inflows to push these things upward,\u201d Erwin Voloder, head of policy at the European Blockchain Association, told DL News.\n\nDigital asset investment firm 21Shares launched its Ethereum Staking ETP in 2019, and Ethereum ETPs from VanEck and CoinShares made their debutsin 2021.\n\nBut inflows are relatively small.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe 21Shares\u2019 Ethereum ETP has over $307 million assets under management, and VanEck\u2019s has a total net assets of $175 million.\n\nMeanwhile, in the US, institutional investors are already prepared to pour $500 million into Ethereum ETFs over the next week if they are approved, according to an analysis by the OKX exchange.\n\nEnthusiasm in the US\n\nThe products follow the price of Ether and allow investors a way into crypto through a bank or investment firm without having to open a crypto wallet or an account with a crypto platform.\n\nFor proponents, crypto ETFs and ETPs provide digital assets with validation and a bridge to broader financial markets.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January. The two biggest funds, launched by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, have vacuumed up more than $30 billion between the two of them as of Thursday.\n\nBut there are stark differences between Europe and the US.\n\nEurope has \u201cmore of an ecosystemic approach\u201d to innovative finance, according to Voloder.\n\nWith legal frameworks for crypto assets starting to come into effect this year and other investment guidelines from regulators, lawmaking sets the foundations.\n\n\u2018Even if Europe has the regulations, our investor base has always lagged behind America.\u2019 \u2014 Erwin Voloder\n\n\u201cEU regulators are more proactive and US regulators are more reactive which is why you see broker dealers launching digital asset structured products in Europe,\u201d Voloder said.\n\n\u201cRegulations enable innovation and experimentation,\u201d he added. This is what allows financial institutions to test tokenised financial instruments.\n\nBut still the size of the capital markets is reflected by that underlying divergence.\n\n\u201cEven if Europe has the regulations to enable innovation, our investor base has always lagged behind America,\u201d Voloder said.\n\nCrypto ETPs beyond Ethereum\n\nCardano Staking ETP by Liqwid began trading on Deutsche B\u00f6rse exchange group on Wednesday. The product is domiciled in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cSwitzerland is at the forefront, as staking is regulated here, allowing us to build products incorporating staking\u2014something not yet possible in the US,\u201d Florian Volery, co-founder of Liqwid Finance, told DL News in an email. He is hopeful that the US will eventually catch up.\n\nThe DeFi entrepreneur expects to see actively managed ETFs that include other crypto assets like Bitcoin or Solana in an investment strategy.\n\n\u201cThis development is a game changer for the crypto industry, making it mainstream and a dedicated investment category within the asset and wealth management industry,\u201d Volery said.\n\nInbar Preiss is a Regulation Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Margin Trade Ethereum and Other Top Crypto with up to 50x Leverage Directly from Crypto Wallet\n\nDUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES / ACCESSWIRE / May 23, 2024 / HUX , a leading platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has recently upgraded its offerings, introducing the ability to trade Ethereum, Bitcoin and other top crypto's with up to 50X leverage. Hux caters to both seasoned traders and newcomers, providing sophisticated tools to amplify trading strategies all directly from your crypto wallet.\n\nEthereum Leverage Trading: Long or Short ETH with Up to 50X Leverage on HUX\n\nHow to long Ethereum with Leverage?\n\nLeverage trading allows traders to increase their exposure to Ethereum without needing the full amount of capital typically required. On HUX, traders can choose how much leverage they wish to apply, up to a maximum of 50 times their actual investment. This means that for every dollar, a trader can hold a position worth up to fifty dollars in Ethereum. To initiate a leverage trade, a trader selects their desired level of leverage on the trading dashboard, inputs the amount of ETH they wish to trade, and executes the order, closely monitoring the market for fluctuations.\n\nUnique Trading Features of HUX for Crypto Leverage Trading\n\nBeyond the basic leverage mechanisms, HUX Finance offers several unique features that enhance the trading experience:\n\nDirect Trading from Wallet: HUX allows users to trade directly from their cryptocurrency wallets, bypassing the need to transfer funds to the platform. This feature enhances security and convenience, as traders can maintain control over their funds until the moment of trade.\n\nLimit and Stop-Loss Orders: Traders can set limit orders to execute a trade at a specific price point and stop-loss orders to automatically close a position at a predetermined price. This functionality is crucial for managing risk and securing profits without needing to monitor the market continuously.\n\nOne-Click Trading: For those looking to execute trades quickly, HUX offers a one-click trading feature, which simplifies the trading process. This is particularly useful in volatile market conditions where speed is of the essence.\n\nThese features, combined with high leverage options, make HUX a robust platform for trading Ethereum, catering to both novice and experienced traders by providing tools that facilitate effective trading strategies and risk management.\n\nHow to Short Ethereum on HUX?\n\nShorting Ethereum is a strategy used by traders who anticipate that the price of ETH will decrease. On HUX, to short ETH, traders select the 'Short' option, effectively selling ETH at the current market price with the expectation to buy it back at a lower price in the future. This is done using leverage to increase potential gains from small price movements. Establishing a short position involves specifying the amount of ETH to short and the level of leverage. Traders also have the option to set limit orders to enter the market at a specific price, and use stop-loss orders to manage risk by specifying a price at which the position should be automatically closed to prevent significant losses.\n\nStory continues\n\nRisk Management and Auto-Deleveraging\n\nNavigating high leverage and short positions comes with significant risks, particularly from volatile market movements that could lead to rapid gains or losses. HUX's risk management tools are designed to help traders manage these scenarios effectively. The platform includes features like real-time liquidation alerts and auto-deleveraging (ADL), which helps maintain market stability by automatically reducing leverage in overly exposed positions, ensuring the market's balance and integrity. Trading Ethereum on HUX involves certain fees, which are clearly outlined in the platform's fee structure. These include fees for opening and closing positions, as well as fees based on the trade's impact on the market's liquidity. Additionally, HUX offers different market types - fully backed and synthetic markets, each catering to different trading strategies and risk levels.\n\nWith the introduction of up to 50X leverage for Ethereum trading, along with the ability to long/short ETH, HUX is setting a new benchmark in the DeFi trading space. These tools enhance the trading experience by providing flexibility, extensive market exposure, and effective risk management mechanisms, making HUX an attractive platform for Ethereum traders aiming to capitalize on market trends and volatility.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany Name: HUX Finance\n\nEmail: contact@hux.finance\n\nWebsite: https://hux.finance\n\nFollow on Twitter: https://x.com/huxfinance\n\nSOURCE: Hux Finance\n\n\n\n\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "SEC Approves All Spot Ethereum ETFs - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The culmination of a tumultuous journey has finally arrived, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the issuance of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Indeed, the decision arrived just five months after the agency granted similar approval to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs to start the year.\n\nThe decision marks the approval of the country\u2019s second crypto-based ETF. Moreover, it represents a monumental shift in the overall accessibility of the second-largest cryptocurrency to institutional investors.\n\nBREAKING: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC officially approves all spot Ethereum ETFs. May 23, 2024\n\nThe official filing was published briefly by the SEC, but it was taken down shortly after by the regulator, possibly due to being leaked early. The filing has since been republished. The SEC initially looked to delay the approval decision as long as they could due to previous sentiment against cryptocurrencies, but now the ETF market will include both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Issuers will still have to wait for their individual filings to be approved.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Chair Gary Gensler: \u2018Stay Tuned\u2019 on Ethereum ETF Decision\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs Approved by SEC\n\nFollowing the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs at the start of 2024, the market anticipated what cryptocurrency could be next. Naturally, all eyes are directed toward Ethereum. Although it appears likely, the overall sentiment of the SEC has diminished optimism that such an approval could take place.\n\nThat changed significantly at the start of May\u2019s second to last week. Seemingly out of nowhere, Bloomberg increased the approval odds from 25% to 75%. Thereafter, the market began anticipating the impending arrival of the Ethereum-based investment offering.\n\nNow, that anticipation has been rewarded as the SEC has approved all Spot Ethereum ETFs. The landmark decision means that the United States now features crypto-based ETFs for the two most prominent digital assets in the world. Moreover, it is a critical part of a greater transition for the country\u2019s perspective on the assets.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Cryptocurrencies To Buy For 5X Gains In Anticipation Of Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nConversely, applications for the Ether-based ETFs have been submitted by a plethora of issuers. Specifically, VanEck, ARK21 Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaaxy, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock. Of those firms, VanEck faced the most immediate approval deadline.\n\nWhat Is The Next Step For Spot Ethereum ETFs?\n\nNow that Ethereum ETF 19b-4 forms have been approved, issuers must wait for their S-1 forms to be approved before trading of the assets can commence. These forms are necessary to offer new securities publicly. This process may take more time for the SEC to process for each filer, especially if the regulator still holds any dissatisfaction for Ethereum ETFs. Based on the timeline for the Bitcoin ETFs, this process could take anywhere from weeks to months.\n\nAll eyes are on how the situation could affect the market as a whole. Bitcoin\u2019s offering led the asset to reach an all-time high in just three months. Many experts predict similar developments for Ethereum, with building anticipation of the ETF leading the asset to increase almost 30% over the last 7 days, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) discount has shrunk to under 10%, its lowest level since 2021, amid growing expectations for approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAs of May 21, market data from YCharts shows the ETHE discount rate has narrowed to 6.66%. The \u201cdiscount\u201d indicates when ETHE shares trade below their net asset value (NAV).\n\nETHE began trading at a discount in early 2021 after Grayscale halted redemptions, reaching nearly 60% in late 2022.\n\nHowever, it started to narrow in 2023 as Grayscale secured significant legal victories against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. Since then, the discount has hovered between 10% and 20% before sharply dipping to 6% following recent developments around the Ethereum ETF.\n\nWhat is driving the discount?\n\nThis week, reports emerged that the US SEC might approve spot Ethereum ETFs, a significant shift from previous expectations.\n\nSeveral ETF applicants swiftly amended their filings with the financial regulator in response. On May 21, Grayscale and other issuers like Fidelity withdrew the staking proposal from their spot Ethereum ETF plans.\n\nAs a result, market analysts have suggested that the narrowing discount in ETHE was a sign that traders were piling into the product to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities the discount presented and sell spot if ETHE converts to an ETF.\n\nConsequently, experts have cautioned that a Grayscale Ethereum ETF could experience substantial outflows at launch, mirroring the GBTC\u2019s situation. Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, wrote:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget what happened with GBTC post BTC ETF approval. Grayscale\u2019s ETH product holds 2.9m ETH (c. $10bn). This represents about 76% of the total float of ETH investment products globally. This was more than GBTC held prior to BTC ETF approval.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "SEC approves Ethereum ETFs, aligning ETH closer to commodity in industry win - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 19b-4 filings, marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry. The decision, announced today, allows Ethereum ETFs from asset managers such as Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise to be listed on their respective exchanges.\n\nEthereum rose 2% on the news and was trading at $3,900 as of press time, based on CryptoSlate data.\n\nThe approval follows a rigorous application process and extensive market analysis. Grayscale\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Craig Salm, previously highlighted that the SEC had already addressed key issues during the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are applicable to Ethereum ETFs as well. These issues include creation and redemption processes, cash versus in-kind transactions, and custody concerns. Salm emphasized that the SEC\u2019s prior engagement with Bitcoin ETF issuers laid the groundwork for Ethereum ETFs, noting the strong correlation between ETH futures and spot prices as a compelling factor for approval.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision comes after a period of uncertainty and skepticism among market analysts. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas had previously estimated a 25% chance of approval by May 23, citing the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement compared to the Bitcoin ETF approval process. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, Hong Kong\u2019s ETH ETF approval, and recent crypto wins in Congress had raised hopes among crypto proponents despite the SEC\u2019s historically cautious stance under Gary Gensler\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe approval process included a public comment period, during which the SEC sought feedback on various aspects of the proposed ETFs, including custodianship of funds, creation, and redemption models, and sponsor fees. This phase mirrored the approach taken with spot Bitcoin ETF applications, encouraging feedback from US citizens and organizations.\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to have a significant impact on the digital assets market. Hong Fang, president of crypto exchange OKX, noted that while Ethereum\u2019s price has risen this year, it has lagged behind Bitcoin\u2019s gains, a disparity likely influenced by market anticipation of the SEC\u2019s decision. The approval is anticipated to boost investor confidence and increase market liquidity.\n\nSeveral issuers filed applications to list their ETF on the NYSE Arca exchange, with Coinbase Custody serving as the custodian. Bitwise\u2019s analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the ETH spot market and the CME ETH futures market, a critical factor in meeting SEC requirements to monitor potential market manipulation.\n\nDespite the positive outcome, some industry insiders had expressed concerns about the SEC\u2019s approach. Participants in recent meetings with the SEC described the talks as one-sided, with agency staff withholding substantive comments on the proposals. This contrasted with the detailed discussions that preceded the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe approval also comes amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of Ethereum\u2019s classification as either a security or a commodity. Reports suggest that the SEC is investigating Ethereum\u2019s regulatory classification, which added uncertainty to the approval prospects. However, today\u2019s decision indicates a favorable stance towards Ethereum-based financial products and a potential indication that Ethereum can be considered a commodity.\n\nThe approval is a landmark event for the crypto industry, reflecting the growing interest in crypto-asset financial products among traditional investment firms. As the market reacts to this development, stakeholders will closely monitor the performance and impact of these newly approved ETFs.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 9:59 am UTC on May. 27, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 3.33% over the past 24 hours.

This year, the sector\u2019s market value has skyrocketed 50% to $2.7 trillion.\n\nAn Ethereum counterpart could excite animal spirits even more. Bernstein analysts\u2019 predicted this week that Ether will surge to $6,600 if the funds are approved.\n\n\u201cEthereum could potentially surpass its all-time high soon after a potential ETH ETF approval,\u201d Lai said.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF will make it easier and cheaper for retail investors to buy exposure to the second most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cLike the Bitcoin ETF before it, an Ethereum ETF will be a significant milestone for the industry,\u201d Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux, CEO of Bitstamp, told DL News.\n\nCost for exchanges\n\nYet there may be a cost for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nETFs enable traders to access the asset class without using digital wallets or industry-native exchanges. Going mainstream, in other words, has many effects.\n\nYet Lai downplayed the long-term risk for exchanges and said the ETFs will provide a gateway for newcomers to crypto.\n\n\u201cIt may actually expand the overall market size, including volume and participants, meaning it\u2019s complementary rather than cannibalistic,\u201d he said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 1% over the past 24 hours to $69,550.\n\nEthereum is up 2.5% to $3,830.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Approved in Abrupt SEC Policy About-Face - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn a stunning reversal, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Thursday that it has approved eight applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, effectively green-lighting Ethereum trading on Wall Street.\n\nThe following funds were approved in the filing: the converted Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, iShares Ethereum Trust, VanEck Ethereum Trust, ARK/21 Shares Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Franklin Ethereum ETF.\n\nWhen will the spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading? It won't be tomorrow. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart suggested in a tweet that it could be a \"couple weeks\" before the fund managers' S-1 documents are approved to enable trading.\n\nGoing to add here. Typically this process takes months. Like up to 5 months in some examples but @EricBalchunas and I think this will be at least somewhat accelerated. #Bitcoin ETFs were at least 90 days. Will know more soon. \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 23, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust one week ago, most financial experts and crypto industry leaders had written off such an outcome as increasingly unlikely. For one, the SEC had offered little indication that it planned to move forward with any spot ETH ETF applications prior to a looming May 23 deadline.\n\nWhat's more, just weeks prior, a lawsuit filed by Ethereum software company Consensys against the SEC alleged that the regulator has secretly considered ETH to be an illegal, unregistered security for over a year. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) If the SEC formally labeled ETH a security, then Ethereum ETFs would need to be approved via a different process than the one currently underway.\n\nThus, in approving spot ETH ETFs today, the SEC has tacitly conceded that ETH is not a security in and of itself. Such an outcome is a major victory for crypto advocates, given ETH\u2019s crucial role in underpinning the Ethereum network\u2014upon which many of the industry\u2019s most prominent projects and services are built.\n\nCrucially, however\u2014in a bid to get over the finish line\u2014several ETH ETF issuers dropped language from their applications this week regarding the staking of customer ETH. Ever since Ethereum transitioned to a proof of stake system in September 2022, ETH holders have been able to deposit their funds with the network to accrue rewards. The SEC has long taken the view that when a financial intermediary offers staking services, it is engaging in an illegally unregistered securities scheme.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs\u2014unlike ETH futures ETFs, which track derivatives contracts and were approved by the SEC in October\u2014involve issuers actually buying and storing ETH on behalf of their clients. Now that spot ETH ETFs have gained approval, traditional financial institutions and investors will soon be able to gain exposure to ETH without holding any crypto themselves.\n\nToday\u2019s historic action follows the SEC\u2019s approval of eleven spot Bitcoin ETF applications in January. Since then, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $13 billion in net in-flows.\n\n\u201cI always called the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, Bitcoin\u2019s IPO,\u201d Cody Carbone, chief policy officer at the crypto lobbying group Digital Chamber of Commerce told Decrypt. \u201cThis is ETH\u2019s IPO. That is a massive stamp of approval.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency exchange is expected to be a major beneficiary if the Security and Exchange Commission approves pending applications for Ether ETFs.\n\nIn a stunning reversal, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of Ether, effectively allowing investors to transact in the cryptocurrency on traditional stock exchanges.\n\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas increased their odds of the ETFs being approved from 25% to 75%. \u201cHearing chatter this afternoon that SEC could be doing a 180 on this (increasingly political issue), so now everyone scrambling (like us everyone else assumed they'd be denied),\u201d Balchunas wrote on X .\n\nThe SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs in January, but industry observers had been growing increasingly pessimistic about the chance for Ether ETFs to be approved because the agency had not been communicating with the companies that had applied for them. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler had in the past said that he believed Ether and so-called altcoins to be unregulated securities. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market valuation, is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTo help push the ETFs across the finish line, this morning five members of the U.S. House of Representatives, a mix of Republicans and Democrats, sent Gensler a letter urging him to \u201cmaintain a consistent and equitable approach\u201d to the Bitcoin ETF applications and approve the pending Ether ETFs.\n\nThe letter was led by French Hill (R-Ark.) and signed by Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), and Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.). Hill is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion of the House Financial Services Committee, and Emmer is the third-ranking Republican on the panel.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the Commission should apply the same principles set forth in the approval of the spot bitcoin ETPs [exchange-traded products] as it evaluates the pending ether ETP applications as the legal considerations pertinent to bitcoin also apply to ether,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cWith the Commission\u2019s actions earlier this year, it seems a natural progression that would not only demonstrate consistency in the Commission\u2019s application of its standards but would also affirm the legal reasoning that facilitated the spot bitcoin ETPs decision. We encourage the Commission to continue enabling and embracing financial innovation while ensuring the full protection of the federal securities laws for investors,\u201d\n\nFour of the signers of the letter have been among the top six recipients in the House of campaign funding in the 2024 election cycle from employees of Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange that has been selected to act as a custodian for several of the proposed ether ETFs.\n\nAccording to The Information , \u201cAt least six out of the nine investment firms that plan to issue ether ETFs have picked Coinbase as a custodian, meaning the crypto company will safeguard ether for giants including BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton. Judging by the success of bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January, Coinbase could soon oversee billions of dollars worth of ether and entrench its position at the center of the crypto ETF boom.\u201d\n\nHill has received more Coinbase money than any other House member so far this election cycle, according to OpenSecrets . Federal Election Commission records show that his campaign and leadership PAC have received a combined $35,600 from the company\u2019s employees since the beginning of last year, including $11,600 from its CEO Brian Armstrong."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, May 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with activity today, marked by notable developments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Furrever Token. As Bitcoin holds steady on Bitcoin Day, maintaining its value from yesterday, Ethereum has captured significant attention by surging 23% in just one week. Adding to the excitement, Furrever Token has caught the eye of many investors with its potential for up to 15X returns, making waves in the crypto community. These dynamic shifts highlight the ever-evolving landscape of digital currencies and the diverse opportunities they present for traders and investors alike.\n\nEthereum Surges 23% in a Week Amid Record ETF Trading Volumes\n\nEthereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,750, nearly unchanged from yesterday but up 23% over the past week. This surge is driven by growing anticipation of spot Ethereum ETF approvals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Ethereum futures ETFs hit a record daily trading volume of $47.75 million, a 40% increase from the previous peak in March. ProShares' Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) led the way, accounting for $43.14 million of the volume, followed by VanEck's Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) with $2.6 million and Bitwise's Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) with $2.01 million.\n\nDespite this new record, Ethereum futures ETF trading volumes remain far below those of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $2.16 billion in trading on Tuesday, dominated by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT with $1.12 billion. Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also saw a significant increase, reaching $684.44 million in daily trading volume, the highest since May 2021.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have increased the likelihood of spot Ethereum ETF approvals from 25% to 75%, citing a possible shift in the SEC\u2019s stance on crypto regulation. This optimism has further fueled Ethereum's recent gains.\n\nAs the market awaits potential SEC approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, the increased trading activity and positive sentiment continue to bolster ETH's price, positioning it for further growth.\n\nBitcoin Holds Steady at $69,400 Amid Market Uncertainty\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $69,400, maintaining a stable position from yesterday but up by 5% over the past week. The slight drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price on Wednesday came as traders cashed in on recent gains fueled by optimism over a potential spot Ether ETF approval.\n\nEther, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, also experienced a pullback after reaching a two-month high earlier in the week. This movement was driven by reports of progress towards the approval of spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is expected to make a key decision later this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the optimism surrounding the spot Ether ETF, broader market sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing concerns about U.S. interest rates. Persistent inflation and warnings from several Federal Reserve officials about the need for more evidence of decreasing inflation before rate cuts can begin have kept traders wary.\n\nAttention is now focused on the minutes from the Fed's late-April meeting, which could provide further insights into the central bank\u2019s plans regarding interest rates. High interest rates generally have a negative impact on crypto markets, as they reduce the attractiveness of high-risk and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe cautious sentiment in the market underscores the delicate balance between optimism over potential regulatory approvals and concerns over macroeconomic factors affecting the crypto landscape. As traders await further cues from the Fed, Bitcoin's price stability reflects the broader uncertainty in the market.\n\nFurrever Token's 15X Return Promise Attracts a Wave of Investors\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) has captured the crypto community's attention with its promise of up to 15X returns for presale investors after its official launch. This enticing potential has sparked a significant influx of investors eager to capitalize on the opportunity before the presale concludes.\n\nThe Furrever Token presale has been a roaring success, with over $1.1 million raised in just three months.

Users must make the transactions using Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). A Wrapped Bitcoin is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin, so one Wrapped Bitcoin is always equal to one Bitcoin. It acts as a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications (dApps).

        "content": "A bipartisan group of US lawmakers advised the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a May 22 letter to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe letter signatories included Financial Committee Vice Chairman Rep. French Hill, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and Representatives Josh Gottheimer, Mike Flood, and Wiley Nickel.\n\nEthereum ETF\n\nIn the letter addressed to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the lawmakers urged the regulator to apply the same principles it used for spot Bitcoin ETFs to Ethereum ETF applications. They argued that this would demonstrate regulatory consistency.\n\nThe letter noted that the launch of Bitcoin ETPs provided a regulated and transparent investment vehicle for American investors. It also highlighted the SEC\u2019s commitment to investor protection and acceptance of modern financial markets \u2014 arguing that approving an Ethereum ETF would reinforce this commitment.\n\nThe lawmakers added:\n\n\u201cWith the Commission\u2019s actions earlier this year, it seems a natural progression that would not only demonstrate consistency in the Commission\u2019s application of its standards but would also affirm the legal reasoning that facilitated the spot Bitcoin ETPs decision.\u201d\n\nThe legislators also stated that the SEC\u2019s market surveillance and enforcement measures would mitigate concerns about market manipulation and that transparency and reporting requirements would enable investors to make informed decisions.\n\nThe support for Ethereum ETFs comes amid a shifting regulatory landscape for crypto in the US. Recently, the industry has been at the center of conversations and debates, leading to the passage of bills to create regulatory clarity for the emerging industry.\n\n\u2018Stay tuned\u2019\n\nThe SEC Chair hinted that a decision on the pending ETH ETF applications is imminent, advising market observers to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\n\nSeveral industry experts anticipate the approval of these financial instruments later today, on May 23.\n\nAfter weeks of minimal engagement, the SEC recently asked exchanges supporting the ETF applications to refile their 19b-4 forms with standardized language. Additionally, the SEC seems to be engaging directly with potential issuers, as companies like Grayscale have filed updated S-1 forms this week.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith big tech companies like Google and Meta pumping potentially unwanted AI features into their messaging platforms, there is a growing call for decentralized and encrypted alternatives that don't rely on the centralized heavyweights.\n\nOne company that aims to provide this service is Here Not There Labs, creator of the Towns social app and the newly launched River Protocol. River aims to offer an alternative to chat platforms like Slack and Discord, powered by blockchain tech and both customizable and private for creators.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of social media products that are decentralized, but you don\u2019t see a lot of social media protocols,\u201d Here Not There Labs co-founder and CEO Ben Rubin told Decrypt. \u201cI do not know of a social media [app] that is owned and operated by the participants of its network that have a means to create trust between one another in a way that is permissionless.\u201d\n\nCreated in 2023, River Protocol is designed to allow developers to build decentralized, real-time messaging applications using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible layer-2 blockchain, off-chain nodes, and smart contracts on Ethereum scaling network Base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA screenshot from Towns, which is built on River Protocol. Image: Here Not There Labs\n\nAccording to the River Protocol website, the project is governed by the River Association, a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO, that allows RVR token holders to participate in the protocol\u2019s future.\n\nRiver Protocol joins a growing number of decentralized applications offering secure communications and social media including Farcaster, BlueSky, Nostr, and Blockscan Chat. But while many social media protocols are aiming to take on Twitter, River Protocol is more focused on teams, companies, and projects who need their own dedicated server.\n\n\u201cEach group is represented as a space, and each space is its own smart contract that is being deployed on-chain,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cWhat the smart contract does is allow the group to issue membership into the space, and also program the entitlement of who can read and write, and under what conditions.\"\n\nAccording to Rubin, this type of setup works best for large groups with specific roles assigned to members like moderators, or who need to set restricted access to channels in the group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRiver stores content off-chain and uses on-chain roll-ups. A bespoke appchain handles messaging to maintain speeds to provide a similar experience to Telegram or WhatsApp. This separation, Rubin added, ensures robust security for permissions while optimizing messaging to be fast and user-friendly\u2014yet maintains user control and decentralization.\n\n\u201cWhile our main deployment is on-chain, you can read on [Ethereum] mainnet, Polygon, or across any other chains to compose rules together,\u201d Here Not There Labs co-founder and CTO Brian Meek added. \u201cAll of that creates a trust route for the messaging, which is happening in the River protocol. But you can cryptographically verify that what is in the River protocol is what is allowed based on what's on-chain.\u201d\n\nOther potential user cases for River Protocol besides messaging apps, Meek added, include connecting players of decentralized video games.\n\n\u201cEverything benefits from communication,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can compose their protocol together into your game, into your app, or into whatever other decentralized experiences you have, and bring in a real-time provable, verifiable, end-to-end encrypted communication experience.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Sander Lutz.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt's Ethereum ETF deadline day for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now sources close to the SEC are saying the regulator has shown signs of warming to the idea of allowing spot Ethereum ETFs to trade.\n\nUnnamed sources told Fox Business that the commission has been taking cues from recent court rulings and its past decision to allow ETH futures ETFs to trade as it considers whether to grant permission for nine funds to begin trading.\n\nMost pressing for the SEC is making a decision on the filings from Cboe exchange to list the VanEck Ethereum ETF and the Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF.\n\nBut that's not all. Counting VanEck and Ark Invest with 21Shares, there are nine total applicants. The rest include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale\u2014which wants to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) the way it did its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\u2014Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, Invesco with Galaxy Digital, and Bitwise.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is north of $3,800\u2014that's 2% higher than it was this time yesterday.\n\nTrading volume swelled to $45 billion in the past 24 hours as hype for a potential Ethereum ETF has surged. For reference, that's just $4 billion shy of the amount of Bitcoin that changed hands in the past day, according to Coinglass.\n\nWhat's more, Ethereum open interest has grown by another 4% to $16 billion. That's also come with some bad news for Ethereum derivatives traders. In the past day $43 million worth of Ethereum futures positions have been liquidated, which is nearly double the value of Bitcoin futures positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass.\n\nMeanwhile, Gensler faced tough questions in a letter from the House Financial Services Committee yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublican lawmakers, including HFSC Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-SC), were curious about the regulator having recently given digital asset firm Prometheum the green light to begin offering an Ethereum custody service.\n\nThe fact that Prometheum is an SEC-regulated firm and got permission from the commission to offer the service seems to imply that the commission is treating ETH like a security\u2014even though it has countless times refused to share its position on the matter.\n\nAs a footnote: An unredacted version of the Consensys lawsuit against the SEC over its treatment of Ethereum says that an internal memo circulated last year instructed commission staff to treat ETH like a security."

        "content": "The SEC is poised to approve a set of Ethereum ETF filings on Thursday.\n\nHowever, it may take weeks or months for the products to actually launch.\n\nDon\u2019t expect spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds to launch immediately after the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlights them.\n\nUp until Monday, the SEC seemed poised to deny all applications for Ethereum ETFs, and the agency\u2019s sudden change of heart has surprised both its staff and prospective issuers.\n\nNow, with a crucial deadline looming, it\u2019s likely that the SEC will approve in all-but-official terms the investment products on Thursday\u2014 but it will probably still need more time to sort through paperwork before the ETFs can launch.\n\n\u201cThere will be days (at a minimum), likely at least weeks, and potentially months between approval and launches here,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart posted.\n\n\u201cIt will be weeks, not months, but all of us are just making educated guesses,\u201d Eric Balchunas, another Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, told DL News. \u201cThe intel will come soon though, we\u2019ll know for sure.\u201d\n\nSEC filings\n\nAt issue are two sets of filings that prospective ETF issuers must get sorted: 19b-4 filings and S-1 filings.\n\n19b-4 filings are signed off by the SEC\u2019s Trading and Markets division, while S-1 forms are handled by the regulator\u2019s division of Corporate Finance.\n\nIt\u2019s only after they\u2019re both finalised that the SEC can officially greenlight the products.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAll prospective ETF issuers need their 19b-4s in order by Thursday if they want their product ready for launch day. That\u2019s because a crucial deadline for VanEck\u2019s 19b-4 filing is coming up: If the SEC doesn\u2019t approve that filing by then, it will be as if the agency rejected the application.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just VanEck\u2019s problem. Just like with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC likely wants to approve all potential Ethereum ETFs at the same time to avoid giving an advantage to any one specific product. So every issuer needs to rush to get that document ready by VanEck\u2019s deadline.\n\nHowever, once the 19b-4s are approved, the SEC and prospective issuers have a lot more time to finalise S-1 filings.\n\n\u201cThe SEC spent nearly four months reviewing and iterating Bitcoin spot S-1s and five months reviewing Bitcoin futures S-1s,\u201d Scott Johnsson, an associate at international law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, wrote.\n\n\u201cIf the division of Corporation Finance indeed was told about this potential approval yesterday, then they\u2019re likely just getting started,\u201d he added.\n\nIn other words, the SEC will likely signal on Thursday that it will be approving the Ethereum ETFs by finalising the 19b-4 filings \u2014 but it will only officially greenlight them later on, possibly this summer, once the S-1 filings are dealt with as well.\n\n\u201cA month would be a pretty quick turnaround,\u201d Johnsson said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically a single turn of SEC comments.\u201d\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

The SEC's request for financial managers to amend and resubmit their 19b-4 filings for proposed spot Ether ETFs was seen as a positive sign by some analysts, increasing the potential likelihood of approval from 25% to 75%"

Currently, VanEck's ETF is designated as inactive on the DTCC website, indicating it cannot be processed until it secures the required regulatory approvals.\n\nNotably, VanEck is not the first Ether ETF listed by the DTCC; Franklin Templeton's spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF was listed on the platform a month ago.\n\nThe DTCC's list includes both active ETFs that can be processed and those that are not yet active.\n\nThe final SEC decision on the VanEck spot Ether ETF application is expected by May 23.\n\nAfter months of speculation about a likely denial of spot ETH ETFs, the SEC took significant action earlier this week by asking financial managers to amend and refile their 19b-4 filings on their proposed spot Ether ETFs.\n\nThis move has been interpreted by some analysts as a positive indication, raising the potential approval chance to 75% from 25%.\n\nIn a parallel development, Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has filed an updated 19b-4 form for BlackRock\u2018s BLK spot Ethereum ETF, with other amended filings also coming in.\n\nNasdaq submitted the amended form for the world's largest asset manager on Wednesday, while Exchange CboeBZX filed revamped 19b-4 forms late Tuesday for five spot ETF proposals.\n\nThese amended filings followed the SEC's request for exchanges to revise their 19b-4s earlier this week.\n\nAlso Read: White House Won\u2019t Veto Crypto Bill, But Seeks Stronger Consumer Protections\n\nForm 19b-4s notify the SEC about a proposed rule change and need the agency's approval before spot ether ETFs can become effective.\n\nAdditionally, S-1 registration statements would need to be approved before the funds can start trading.\n\nNasdaq's latest filing includes language similar to other amended 19b-4s regarding staking, indicating that the Fund\u2019s ETH cannot be staked.\n\n\u201cNeither the Trust, nor the Sponsor, nor the Ether Custodian (as defined below), nor any other person associated with the Trust will, directly or indirectly, engage in action where any portion of the Trust's ETH becomes subject to the Ethereum proof-of-stake validation or is used to earn additional ETH or generate income or other earnings,\u201d according to BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nAdding to the flurry of activity, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed on platform X that Grayscale GBTC has submitted a revised 19b-4 file for its Ethereum Mini Trust.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The implications of these developments and other regulatory trends in the digital asset space will be further explored at Benzinga\u2019s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nThis event will bring together industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the evolving role of digital assets in the global financial landscape.\n\nRead Next: Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations \u2018Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?\u2019\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "title": "SEC approves rule change to allow creation of ether ETFs - CNBC",
        "content": "A representation of cryptocurrency Ethereum is placed on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken on June 16, 2023.\n\nThe SEC has approved a rule change Thursday that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether , one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe decision comes less than six months after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved bitcoin ETFs. Those funds have proven to be a big success for the industry, with net inflows already surpassing $12 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nLate May had long been pegged as a potential decision date for the ether funds since it coincided with a deadline for the SEC to decide whether the VanEck Ethereum ETF could proceed.\n\nMany of the companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs \u2014 including BlackRock, Bitwise and Galaxy Digital \u2014 have also started the process of the launching an ether fund.\n\nThe price of ether rose just 2%, although it follows a 20% surge from earlier in the week in anticipation of Thursday's decision. Some investors may also be on pause, as the SEC's rule change approval does not guarantee that all the funds will launch.\n\nSpecifically, the SEC's order approves applications from various exchanges to list eight different ether funds. The order technically does not approve the funds themselves or set a date for the ETFs to begin trading.\n\nEther ETFs are expected to be smaller, at least initially, than their bitcoin counterparts. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust currently has about $11 billion in assets, much smaller than what the firm's bitcoin fund was before its conversion.\n\nThe approval of the ether ETFs is a sign that the SEC's stance toward crypto may be softening after a series of legal fights. The agency lost a lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023 that spurred the approval for the bitcoin products.\n\nThe SEC's push to regulate crypto has also come under scrutiny by politicians. The Senate last week passed a resolution to withdraw an SEC staff bulletin about accounting rules for digital assets.\n\nEther is the second largest crypto asset and has become something of a blue chip coin along with bitcoin, although its value proposition is distinctly different. While bitcoin is seen primarily as a long-term store of value, an investment in ether is considered more akin to an investment in early stage technology. The ether token fuels the Ethereum network, which powers different applications, like decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) or the tokenization of real world assets like commodities, securities, art, real estate and more.\n\nThe applications approved Thursday do not apply to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network, said Richard Kerr, a partner in the law firm K&L Gates.\n\n\"If and when an ether product is approved, it won't mean that a similar product for other digital assets on the Ethereum platform would be approved,\" Kerr said.\n\nEthereum also provides opportunities for staking, which is a way for investors to earn interest on their ether holdings by locking up tokens on the network for a period of time \u2014 although ether ETFs in the U.S. may not participate. The SEC has alleged in lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken that staking-as-a-service offerings are unregistered securities. Ark, Fidelity and Grayscale updated their filings this month to remove staking from their proposals.\n\nThe lack of staking in the ETF products is another reason why ether ETFs may see less demand than their bitcoin counterparts, said Steven Lubka, managing director at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Private.\n\n\"These numbers are not going to match the bitcoin ETF inflows, and there are some structural differences in the product that just make it less attractive overall,\" Lubka said."

        "content": "Closely followed economist Alex Kr\u00fcger believes approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) could quickly send the top altcoin to new all-time highs (ATHs).\n\nIn a new Unchained \u201cBits + Bips\u201d podcast, Kr\u00fcger says the market has yet to price in a spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nHe predicts an approval will send Ethereum soaring against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) to at least .070 BTC ($4,865) within months.\n\n\u201cIf the ETF gets approved, which seems like it\u2019s likely now, it\u2019s kind of clear that with an ETF approval, we\u2019re going to see all-time highs very, very soon. Because the market is not positioned for it. You were saying 25%. I would even think that the market had priced in almost like 0% probability or as close as it gets to no chance whatsoever.\n\nETH has been one of the most hated coins, if not the most hated coin of this cycle, and it\u2019s reflected on price. ETH/BTC is like .052 BTC. So it does make sense for that to go all the way up to at least .070 BTC ($4,865) in the next couple of months. These things happen usually rather fast.\u201d\n\nKr\u00fcger also believes there are institutions that would move to invest in an ETH ETF product.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of demand out there.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.05362 BTC ($3,731) at time of writing. ETH reached an all-time high of about $4,900 in November 2021.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "What Ethereum ETF Approvals Would Mean for US Crypto Policy - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated earlier this week that it was suddenly open to the prospect of approving spot Ethereum ETFs, after months of stubborn signals to the contrary, the about-face didn\u2019t just catch Crypto Twitter by surprise.\n\nIt also shocked the nation\u2019s top crypto lobbyists, who spend their days tracing minuscule shifts in Washington\u2019s mood on the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a remarkable pivot,\u201d Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a prominent crypto lobbying group, told Decrypt. \u201cIt is one that I did not foresee.\u201d\n\nHow did the pivot come to pass? And after years of relentless hostility against the crypto industry, might the development indicate that the SEC, and the U.S. government more broadly, are changing their tune on crypto?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we've absolutely turned a corner,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt marks a complete shift in understanding about the political importance of crypto.\u201d\n\nCrypto industry lobbyists who spoke with Decrypt attribute the SEC\u2019s sudden tack to a recent change of political winds in the nation\u2019s capital. Most agree the series of events that prompted the change kicked off last week, when President Joe Biden issued a forceful threat to veto a pro-crypto bill.\n\nThe bill, which sought to repeal an SEC rule dubbed SAB 121\u2014which discourages American banks from holding crypto\u2014later passed in the Senate with a surprising amount of support from Biden\u2019s own party. Twelve Democrats supported the bill, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader.\n\nThat degree of Democratic support was not anticipated on Capitol Hill. And it undoubtedly sent a message to the White House, the Blockchain Association\u2019s Smith believes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo have that many [Democrats] break away from the Biden Administration after it already put out a veto threat on it,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is significant.\u201d\n\nExacerbating matters is the fact that, in recent weeks, Republicans including former president Donald Trump have begun embracing crypto more explicitly than ever before\u2014creating the impression among crypto industry leaders that only one political party is on their side.\n\nCody Carbone, Chief Policy Officer at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, another crypto lobbying group, believes the pressure recently applied by Republicans on crypto, in tandem with the open dissent Biden is now facing on the subject from leaders within his own party, led the president to make a calculated decision to back off crypto\u2014at least for now.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is seeing, in a very tight election that can be swung by a few million votes, that this is not the hill to die on,\u201d Carbone told Decrypt.\n\nThat evolution in Biden\u2019s thinking could already be seen Wednesday, when the president issued a statement regarding another crypto-related bill up for a vote this week\u2014FIT21\u2014which seeks to create a federal framework for regulating crypto. While Biden objected to the bill\u2019s passage, he crucially did not threaten to veto it, as he did last week with the repeal of SAB 121.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, FIT21 easily passed a vote in the House, 279-136, with support from 71 Democrats including former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n\nJi Kim, chief legal and policy officer at lobbying group Crypto Council for Innovation, sees the events of the last week as proof that crypto has now\u2014albeit suddenly\u2014 graduated into a topic of consensus within U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cWhat this all means is that crypto is absolutely a bipartisan issue,\" he said, \"and that members of Congress are further realizing crypto is absolutely here to stay.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the same reasons the White House is now tacking on crypto to save face, the SEC is too, crypto lobbyists say\u2014especially given that the unexpectedly popular, bipartisan repeal of SAB 121 singled out the policies of SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nRubber-stamping spot Ethereum ETFs\u2014which would allow Wall Street firms to buy and store ETH on behalf of their clients\u2014might prove the most visible way for Gensler to take some heat off his back, the Blockchain Association\u2019s Kristin Smith estimates.\n\n\u201cI think this is his sort of peace offering, to show that he is open to this space, and he realizes now that the political winds are against him,\u201d she said.\n\nBut crypto lobbyists disagree on what the move would mean for the SEC\u2019s long-term crypto policy moving forward.\n\nSmith is optimistic the change of heart would mark a major shift in how Gensler and the SEC might police crypto from now on.\n\n\u201cI think he's going to have no choice but to back down,\u201d she said of the SEC Chair. \u201cThat doesn't mean he goes back and undoes all the actions that he's initiated\u2014but he's going to have to think twice before doing something aggressive against the crypto industry.\u201d\n\nThe Chamber of Digital Commerce\u2019s Cody Carbone, however, has a less cheery outlook. He figures spot Ethereum ETF approvals would represent nothing more than a cold and calculated political maneuver on Gensler\u2019s part. A meaningful change in the SEC\u2019s outlook on crypto? Far from it.\n\n\u201cI don't think you're going to see him dropping any of these cases or stop fighting,\u201d Carbone said of Gensler. \u201cI just don't think you'll see any more headlines. Most of his decisions are driven by PR.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Jack Mallers, CEO and founder of Chicago-based bitcoin payment provider Strike, in a Wednesday interview on Bloomberg stated that the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is a move driven by the interests of the broader financial industry.\n\nWhat Happened: \u201cNot a fan,\u201d Mallers told Bloomberg when asked about his opinion of the likely-looking approval. But there is a \u201chilarious story\u201d behind the sudden change in expectations, Mallers continued.\n\nIn his opinion, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was proverbially told \u201cHey, buddy, you\u2019re not in charge anymore\u201d and thus forced to change his stance on Ethereum ETH/USD and the spot ETF decision.\n\n\u201cBanks and Wall Street are making money\u201d with ETFs, Mallers stated, and are therefore interested in financializing more cryptocurrencies to create revenue.\n\nIn contrast to bonds, \u201cwhich are performing awfully,\u201d cryptocurrency ETFs are \u201cway better business.\u201d This, Mallers asserted, led to Gary Gensler\u2019s hand being forced by the interests of Wall Street, despite him thinking Ethereum is a security.\n\nWhen asked about the potential of Ethereum, Mallers said he sees the entire process as \u201ca distraction\u201d for Wall Street to earn revenue.\n\nCrypto \u201chas life\u201d and Wall Street, according to Mallers, \u201cloves volatility.\u201d However, this process distracts attention from his opinion that \u201cBitcoin is the only money in crypto.\u201d\n\nMallers regards Ethereum as \u201ca technology,\u201d but says \u201cthe market conflates it as a money and a commodity.\u201d\n\nUnlike Bitcoin BTC/USD, which can be \u201cthe world reserve asset,\u201d Ethereum is more in competition with other technology companies like Nvidia.\n\nBut Mallers considers this Ethereum\u2019s weakness, saying this value proposition \u201cgets confusing\u201d because there is no clear leadership, strong cash flows and a lot of changes in Ethereum\u2019s roadmap, leading to \u201cintentional confusion.\u201d\n\nAs \u201ca bitcoiner,\u201d that frustrates Mallers because he is trying to \u201cfix the money, fix the world.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: White House Won\u2019t Veto Crypto Bill, But Seeks Stronger Consumer Protections\n\nWhy It Matters: The criticism comes as the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs will be decided by Thursday at the latest.\n\nThe anticipation has prompted cryptocurrency markets to surge, with Bitcoin tipped to hit an all-time high soon and Ethereum-based meme coins benefiting from the increased interest in the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga\u2019s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next: Is Donald Trump Accepting Crypto Donations \u2018Just Another Cow For Him To Milk?\u2019"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe UK\u2019s first cryptocurrency exchange traded products are finally set to begin trading next week, almost a decade after the first such vehicles appeared in Sweden.\n\nWisdomTree, 21Shares and Invesco have been given the green light by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, to list ETPs investing in \u201cphysical\u201d spot bitcoin and ether, the two most popular digital tokens, on the London Stock Exchange on May 28.\n\nHowever, the ETPs \u2014 which form part of a barrage of similar vehicles expected to list on the LSE \u2014 will only be available to professional investors because the FCA has ruled that \u201ccrypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose\u201d.\n\nThe stance is in sharp contrast to stock exchanges across much of continental Europe, as well as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and the US, which offer crypto ETPs to both retail and institutional investors.\n\nUS-listed spot bitcoin ETFs already boast combined assets of $50bn, despite only launching in January, with about 80 per cent of this held by retail investors, according to regulatory filings.\n\nA series of other crypto ETP managers, including ETC Group and CoinShares, are known to have filed to list vehicles on the LSE, ideally also on May 28 if they receive regulatory sign-off from the FCA in time.\n\n\u201cThe FCA approval of our crypto ETPs\u2019 prospectus is a significant step forward for the industry and UK-based professional investors seeking exposure to the asset class,\u201d said Alexis Marinof, head of Europe at WisdomTree, which has $111bn under management globally.\n\n\u201cWhile UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point. FCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs will have fees of 0.35 per cent, the same as equivalent vehicles listed in a number of continental European exchanges.\n\nOphelia Snyder, co-founder of 21 Shares, which will cross-list its existing Bitcoin and Ethereum Staking ETPs in the UK, with fees of 1.49 per cent, said: \u201cLondon hosts one of the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world \u2014 where there is proven institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nInvesco will bring its $240mn Physical Bitcoin ETP, already listed in Germany and Switzerland, to London with a 0.39 per cent fee.\n\nAll the UK-listed crypto funds will be constructed as exchange traded notes, a structure common across the European cryptocurrency market. The FCA has only approved vehicles that invest in bitcoin and ether and which are unleveraged and physically backed.\n\nDespite the retail investor ban, issuers remain hopeful that there will be sufficient interest among UK-based professional investors to make cross-listing their ETPs in London worthwhile.\n\nMore than 900 institutional investors have built stakes in US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, SEC filings show, suggesting there may be an audience even for ETNs that are off-limits to retail investors.\n\n\u201cHedge funds and small family offices have always had an appetite [for crypto ETFs]. Private banks and discretionary fund managers are a little bit more hesitant, but they want to look at this asset class. Multi-asset managers are also looking at it,\u201d said Ravinder Azad, head of UK sales at WisdomTree. The company attracted 14 institutional investors to a UK crypto webinar earlier this year but already had more than 140 sign-ups for a follow-up event in June, according to Azad.\n\nBrown Brothers Harriman\u2019s 2024 Global ETF Investor Survey, released this week, found that in each of the US, Europe and Greater China, more institutional investors said they were bullish about the prospects for digital assets than any other asset class over the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, one crypto ETF issuer that has no plans to list a product in the UK while retail investors remain off limits told the FT: \u201cYou are launching a product that is not universal. It needs to be universal. That is the principle that underlies ETFs everywhere.\u201d"

Before this upcoming list, they were listed on Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse Xetra, the SIX Swiss Exchange, and the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.\n\nAlexis Marinof, the Europe head of WisdomTree, noted that the designation from FCA has been a significant part of UK professional investors\u2019 adoption of crypto-values. He also said that certainty of approval might increase institutional participation by eliminating certain rules deeming this asset class off-limits.\n\nHaving been established back in 2019, the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP was the first institutional-grade physically collateralized ETP that sought to offer European investors negotiable certificates representing physically stapled Bitcoin.\n\nThe firm now offers a diverse portfolio of eight such crypto ETPs, providing direct price exposure to individual cryptocurrencies and the crypto market. This development represents a major step forward in both the accessibility and regulatory approval of cryptocurrency investments in the UK."

        "content": "WisdomTree's ETPs offer low-cost, regulated crypto exposure with a 0.35% TER.\n\nShare this article\n\nWisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor, has secured the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s (FCA) approval to list its WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to a press release published today. The listing, expected to occur on May 28, will initially cater exclusively to professional investors.\n\nAs previously reported by Crypto Briefing, May 28 is also expected to be the debut date of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on the LSE.\n\nThis move positions WisdomTree among the first to receive FCA endorsement for a crypto ETP prospectus. Institutions in Europe can now gain exposure to crypto backed by Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, via these ETPs.\n\nWith a Total Expense Ratio (TER) of just 0.35%, WisdomTree\u2019s upcoming crypto ETPs are among the most cost-efficient options for investors in the region.\n\nCommenting on the latest development, Alexis Marinof, Head of Europe at WisdomTree, said the FCA approval not only facilitates easier access for UK investors but also removes the regulatory hurdles that previously discouraged investors from entering the market.\n\n\u201cWhile UK-based professional investors have been able to allocate to crypto ETPs via overseas exchanges, they will soon have a more convenient access point,\u201d Marinof stated.\n\n\u201cFCA approval in this respect could result in greater institutional adoption of the asset class, as many professional investors have been unable to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to regulatory limitations and uncertainty \u2013 we would expect FCA approval of our crypto ETPs\u2019 prospectus to remove those barriers to entry,\u201d he added.\n\nWisdomTree\u2019s commitment to providing secure, regulated investment vehicles for crypto assets began in 2019 with the launch of the WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin ETP.\n\nThe firm has since expanded its offerings to encompass a suite of eight physically backed crypto ETPs. These ETPs provide exposure to both individual cryptocurrencies and diversified baskets, and are available for trading on multiple European exchanges.\n\nIn March this year, WisdomTree announced it secured the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval to operate as a New York limited-purpose trust company charter. This development allows WisdomTree to offer fiduciary custody of digital assets, issue DFS-approved stablecoins, and manage stablecoin reserves.\n\n[Update with context in the second paragraph]"

        "content": "Ethereum futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) volumes surged to record highs on Tuesday, as Ethereum had experienced the biggest daily bullish candle the previous day when its price surged from $3,070 to $3,661.\n\nData from TheBlock shows that all three Ethereum futures ETFs, EETH (ProShares Ether Strategy ETF), EFUT (VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF), and AETH (Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF), saw record trading volumes on Tuesday, reaching a total of $47.7 million.\n\nEETH, which is traded on the NYSE Arca at a price of about $80 per share, has the largest share of the three. It saw its trading volumes surging from about $1 million on May 2 to over $43 million on May 21.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust, traded on over-the-counter markets with the ticker ETHE, saw its daily trading volume soaring to $687 million, the highest since H1 2021. ETHE\u2019s volume bounced from less than $30 million the previous week.\n\nThe sudden in Ethereum futures ETF trading volume has been driven by a spike in the price of Ethereum. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has outperformed Bitcoin this week amid the crypto market recovery, gaining about 20% on Monday alone.\n\nInvestors are growing confident that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally approve Ethereum spot ETFs later this month.\n\nOn Monday, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart increased their expectations of spot Ethereum ETF approval from 25% to 75%.\n\nAll eyes are on the SEC, which will decide on Thursday, May 23, whether it gives the green light to VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application. While markets were certain that the SEC would postpone its decision for a later date, the regulator\u2019s requirement for VanEck to amend and refile its ETF filing was regarded as a positive sign.\n\nIf the SEC approves the first Ethereum ETF tomorrow, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may continue its bull run to new highs.\n\nStay on top of things:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter using this link \u2013 we won\u2019t spam!\n\nFollow us on X and Telegram."

Hashdex is the only issuer yet to submit an amendment to its Ethereum ETF 19-b-4s. Grayscale also submitted amended 19b-4s filings for its Ethereum Mini Trust and Ethereum Trust after its initial filings on Tuesday.\n\nThe total number of issuers that have submitted amended 19b-4s filings include: BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, Van Eck, Ark 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin and Invesco.\n\nThe 19b-4s filings are what national exchanges like the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submit to the SEC to seek approval for listing new products on their trading platforms. In the context of ETFs, S-1s refer to the initial registration forms detailing how a fund would be managed and track the underlying asset's price.\n\nWith Hashdex\u2019s filing left, the market has begun the countdown for the SEC's decision.\n\nRead more: Ethereum sees a 16% spike as Bloomberg analysts surprisingly increase approval odds to 75%\n\nWhile most of the recent updates have been on 19b-4s, Fox Business\u2019 Eleanor Terret said SEC staff have now begun conversations with issuers on their S-1s, \"with the conclusion being that there's work to do\" on those.\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart mentioned earlier that the approval of 19b-4s filings is only a part of the required approvals from the SEC, as the agency would also have to approve S-1 filings before spot ETH ETFs can launch. Seyffart suggested that while S-1 approval is a matter of \u201cwhen\u201d and not \u201cif,\u201d it may take days to weeks before the SEC approves them.\n\nConsidering the SEC's recent subpoenas to Ethereum-related firms and earlier silence on the ETFs, many have suggested that their 180 turn is political. Seyffart said the agency's recent change of mind may have been a decision from above, possibly US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe SEC approving spot ETH ETFs \"will be one of the biggest regulatory 180s in recent SEC history and proof that the crypto crowd is a legitimate voting block, securities lawyers tell me,\" says Fox Business Charles Gasparino.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum bulls await ETF approval\n\nEthereum traded around $3,737 on Wednesday as bulls appear to be conserving strength for a potential SEC spot ETH ETF approval on Thursday.\n\nThe $3,618 level serves as a support in case of a short-term downward move. ETH liquidation data also confirms that bulls may be slowing down, with over $28 million in long liquidations out of a total of $49.96 million worth of liquidations.\n\nAlso read: Week Ahead: Ethereum and DeFi to come under spotlight this week\n\nIf the SEC approves the spot ETH ETFs on Thursday, Ethereum may skyrocket over 30% to set a new all-time high above $4,878.\n\nThis aligns with predictions from Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin, who said ETH could see much higher prices if the ETFs are approved as there would be less supply to meet demand. Bernstein analysts have also predicted that Ethereum may see a 75% surge to $6,600, similar to Bitcoin's 75% surge after its ETF approval."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nApproving multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs has greatly shifted the narrative of ETFs in the cryptocurrency community, particularly among traders and investors alike. With a more positive outlook on ETF approvals, market players are optimistic that an Ethereum-based ETF could make its way into the market.\n\nMore recently, emerging data has validated investors\u2019 positive sentiments; as such, expectations for the approval of an Ethereum ETF have skyrocketed. Notably, other altcoins have also benefited from the ongoing development.\n\nAccording to data shared by Santiment, a notable Cryptocurrency on-chain analytical platform, the positive reception surrounding a potential Ethereum ETF approval has triggered a spike in the price value of other alternative tokens.\n\nETH, UNI, PEPE, BONK, and LDO have all collectively recorded more than a 20% increase in price value over the past 48 hours. Additionally, the market cap has also increased significantly. BONK, UNI, and LDO have seen their market caps soar by 44%, +43%, and +38%, respectively.\n\nThe price rally almost clouds Bitcoin\u2019s return above the $72,400 price market, a feat obtained for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Santiment shared in a Twitter post,\n\n\u201cThe hype surrounding Ethereum\u2019s first spot ETF has been a catalyst for one of crypto\u2019s top 5 days of 2024. ETH, UNI, PEPE, BONK, & LDO are all over +20% in 24 hours. Bitcoin\u2019s jump to $71.4K for the first time in 6 weeks is almost an afterthought.\u201d\n\nIn the long-term, possible approval of multiple altcoin-based ETFs largely hinges on approving a spot-based Ethereum ETF. As such, a green light from the SEC towards current Ethereum ETF applications could catalyze the approval of future altcoin ETFs.\n\nInterestingly, demand for Ripple\u2019s XRP has increased over the past weeks, with prices soaring by 5.48%. Recall that XRP tapped $0.7503 last year following rumors that investment firm BlackRock had filed for an XRP-spot ETF.\n\nIn January, Steve McClurg, Chief Investment Officer at Valkyrie, fueled the flames of hope for a spot XRP ETF and hinted at a similar possibility for Ethereum. In a Bloomberg interview, McClurg expressed optimism about the future, saying, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a lot of filings come out for Ethereum. I even think we might see something for Ripple given the recent progress.\u201d\n\nWhile the ongoing legal issues could hinder a handful of developments within the Ripple ecosystem, approving an Ethereum-spot ETF could encourage asset managers and institutions to submit XRP-spot-based applications as billions continue to flow into the XRP exchange-traded funds.\n\nSo far, five asset managers have filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF, hinting at a growing demand from key players. Additionally, a Securities and Exchange Commission staff reportedly told exchanges that the regulatory body is leaning towards approval.\n\nIt bears mentioning that although the market strayed away from ETH and other altcoins for the past two months, following the plunge, it saw a major correction on March 20th.\n\n\u201cMarch 20th, in particular, ended up being one of the best price-performance days of 2024, sparked by the news of investors getting likely opportunities of increased exposure to the ETH network and crypto\u2019s first altcoin.\u201d Santiment asserted.\n\nAt report time, ETH is trading at a press price of $3,762. The asset has also sustained over 16% of its one-month price value; making it the best-performing altcoin within the top 4 categories, outperforming BTC, USDT, and BNB."

        "content": "According to a recent Bernstein report, the approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US may establish a precedent for classifying Solana (SOL) as a commodity.\n\nThe classification of cryptocurrencies as either securities or commodities holds significant implications. Commodity classification facilitates ETF applications and approvals, while security classification subjects assets to stricter SEC oversight.\n\n\u2018Big three\u2019\n\nThe approval of spot Ethereum ETFs would mean the SEC views the second-largest crypto as a commodity, setting a critical precedent. This would mark the first time a non-Bitcoin digital asset receives such a classification, raising expectations for Solana to follow suit.\n\nEther\u2019s price increased earlier this week after Bloomberg analysts raised the likelihood of SEC approval for spot Ether ETFs to 75% from 25%, following reports that the regulator requested updates to filings. The SEC\u2019s final decisions on these applications are expected later today, on May 23, following multiple delays.\n\nBernstein\u2019s report noted that Bitcoin\u2019s 75% rally following the approval of spot ETFs suggests similar price action for Ethereum after approval of spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, if the SEC rejects the applications, Ethereum could experience significant volatility and a steep price correction in the coming days, according to CryptoQuant research.\n\nCrypto investor Brian Kelly expressed similar optimistic views about Solana and the potential regulatory approval of Ethereum ETF products during a recent CNBC interview. He speculated that SOL could be the next altcoin to receive ETF approval, highlighting it as a likely candidate for investment managers to push forward.\n\nKelly emphasized that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are the \u201cbig three\u201d digital assets that might see ETF products approved in this cycle. He noted the success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have collectively amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin, valued at around $58 billion, indicating strong demand for regulated crypto investment products.\n\nHowever, Kelly also acknowledged some skepticism within the Solana community. He mentioned that Solana\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) and its classification as a security by the SEC could pose challenges for ETF approval.\n\nDespite this, Kelly remained optimistic that the shifting regulatory and political landscape might increase the chances of Solana ETF approval if Ethereum ETFs receive the green light.\n\nShifting political landscape\n\nThe Bernstein report, released ahead of the SEC\u2019s final decisions on ETH ETF applications, also highlighted a potential shift in the Biden administration\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies based on recent developments.\n\nAdditionally, the report noted that if Trump is reelected, his adminitration is likely to further support the crypto industry through legislative and regulatory measures. According to the report:\n\n\u201cShould Trump get elected, crypto could see significant legislative and agency support, leading to long-lasting structural changes in crypto financial integration.\u201d\n\nThe potential approval of Solana ETFs comes amid a changing regulatory environment and growing bipartisan support for crypto. The recent passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act by the House, with significant Democratic backing, indicates a potential political shift.\n\nLawyer Jake Chervinsky described the bill\u2019s passage as a \u201cvote of no confidence\u201d in the SEC\u2019s current approach to crypto regulation, suggesting political consequences for maintaining an anti-crypto stance.\n\nRegulatory approval of Solana ETFs would mark a significant milestone for the crypto industry, signaling mainstream acceptance and integration. However, with Ether ETFs still awaiting approval, the industry remains cautiously optimistic about the future.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Ethereum Spot ETF Approved: Yet Another Milestone for Crypto Investors - Securities.io",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Thursday.\n\nAmong the approved applications are those from prominent names such as Grayscale, Bitwise, iShares, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. These ETFs will allow everyday investors to buy shares that track Ethereum's price via brokerage accounts in a familiar way.\n\nWhile Ether futures ETFs are currently trading in the market, the spot ETF will allow investors to hold the digital asset itself, which is a big moment for Ethereum and the entire crypto industry.\n\nWhat Went Down?\n\nUp until Monday this week, the crypto market was preparing for an Ethereum Spot ETF rejection when suddenly sentiments took a turn, and the market went green. Much like how Bitcoin Spot ETF approval sent the broad crypto market upwards, including ETH, which surpassed $4k for the first time since the 2021 bull market in March, we are seeing green across the market.\n\nWith Ether leading the narrative, the renewed bullishness had Bitcoin climbing to $71,500, close to its all-time high (ATH) of $73,740 in mid-March this year. The total crypto market market cap meanwhile hit $2.748 trillion. With that, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has entered the \u201cExtreme Greed\u201d zone having a reading of 76, up from 43 at the beginning of this month.\n\nAs crypto prices surged, Ether rallied significantly after a long time. At the beginning of this week, ETH was trading around $3,000, only to surpass $3,800 on Tuesday. With that, ETH\u2019s yearly gain increased to almost 106%, and year-to-date gains (YTD) at 63.8%. Unlike Bitcoin, however, ETH has yet to make a new high, with its ATH being $4,880.\n\nETHBTC ratio, however, finally got some much-needed relief as it went from 0.0447 last week to 0.055 on Tuesday.\n\nAt the same time, the Ethereum open interest (OI), which is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, rose to a new $15 bln peak on May 22, up from $11.21 high from Nov. 2201, as per the data from Coinglass. Binance currently leads the Ethereum derivatives market with OI on the exchange at 1.56 million ETH (worth $5.86bln) which is followed by Bybit 843.78K ETH and then OKX 579.78K ETH.\n\nWhile CME leads Bitcoin OI at 156.62K BTC ($10.98 bln), the global derivatives marketplace ranks fifth in ETH futures open interest at 301.88K ($1.13bln). All of this, however, was before the approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF.\n\nRapid Turnaround\n\nSo, up until this week, the market was out of any narratives after the Bitcoin halving passed and Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US and Hong Kong. The market was anticipating a boring summer, with many expecting the SEC to reject Ethereum ETF due to concerns over Ether\u2019s regulatory status.\n\nNot to mention, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been stressing compliance with securities laws. He has also been emphasizing that \u201cthe vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws.\u201d The SEC, under Gensler\u2019s guidance, has actually been investigating ETH as a potential security.\n\nJust a month before, there had been strong pessimism with CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see anything being approved this side of the year\u201d with PoS blockchains being difficult to get regulatory approval.\n\nVanEck\u2019s CEO also noted complete silence from the SEC regarding the ETF applications, which usually involve a long legal process. Even JPMorgan analysts called for a rejection this month, though they expected an approval ultimately after a legal battle.\n\nHowever, things suddenly flipped on the back of speculation that the SEC is actually planning to approve the Ethereum Spot ETF. This followed analysts in crypto and the traditional financial world voicing their high expectations on a potential approval that would send ETH upwards and altcoin skywards.\n\nThis was further fueled by the securities regulator asking exchanges Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE to update their 19b-4 filings, which inform the SEC of changes, on an accelerated basis. While this did not guarantee that the Ethereum ETF would, in fact, be approved, it did give a big green signal to the market as it was just ahead of the deadline for VanEck\u2019s proposed Ether ETF on Thursday and Ark/21Shares on Friday.\n\nSo, while there has been nothing from the SEC\u2019s side until this week, the call for revised Form 19b-4s resulted in a flurry of submissions from Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Franklin Ethereum ETH, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Vaneck Ethereum ETF, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, ARK 21shares Ethereum ETF, Ishares Ethereum Trust, and Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. The amendments submitted by issuers involved removing Ethereum staking-related text.\n\nThis isn\u2019t enough, though; for the Ethereum Spot ETF to start trading, the issuers need to have their S-1 applications approved, which is the initial registration form for new products to be listed on a national exchange. Moreover, S-1 documents are not bound by a deadline, and as such, the agency can take its sweet time with that.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on May 22 that while \u201call of the rumors and speculation and chatter have been accurate,\u201d it could be weeks or months potentially before ETFs actually launch.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital noted:\n\n\u201cNothing about this situation is straightforward, so difficult to know how quickly they try to push forward this process.\u201d\n\nSuch a sudden, hurried, and uncoordinated move by the SEC is seen as politically motivated. Some believe that 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump's recent expression of support for crypto has the current Biden administration turning crypto positive after being anti-crypto throughout his tenure.\n\nWith all these developments going on, the crypto industry\u2019s expectations for approval rose as Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts increased their odds of a Spot Ethereum ETF from a mere 25% to a whopping 75%, citing the SEC\u2019s positive stance.\n\n\u201cThis was a shock, a \u201choly sht\u201d moment yesterday even for ppl inside the process,\u201d posted Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, on X (previously Twitter). He then goes on to say that the silence from the agency has been deafening so far, which at one point had him wanting to lower the odds below 25%.\n\nThe decentralized prediction platform Polymarket also saw a jump in the Ethereum ETF approval before May 31, with the yes side surging from 10 cents on May 20 to 69 cents on May 22.\n\nBitcoin ETF Paving the Way for Ethereum ETF\n\nWhile a big movement for the industry, it all started more than a decade ago when Grayscale Bitcoin Trust filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF, only to be rejected by the SEC. After the bull market of 2021, the crypto market experienced the debacle of 2022, which saw the crash of FTX and then the SEC\u2019s legal battle with Coinbase and Binance.\n\nBut then, in October 2023, Grayscale secured a win against the SEC when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the regulator had to reverse its rejection of the asset manager\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application, which was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThen in Jan. 2024, the SEC, though unwillingly, finally approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a great success. In less than five months, these investment vehicles have recorded tens of billions of dollars in inflows from the likes of retail investors, hedge funds, and wealth advisers. In fact, within a week of their launch, two of these ETFs managed to attract over $1 bln.\n\nMainstream asset manager giant BlackRock\u2019s IBIT is currently leading the Spot Bitcoin ETF race, having $18.5bln in assets under management (AUM). This is followed by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC at $10.58bln, ARk\u2019s ARKB at $3.17bln, and Bitwise\u2019s BITB ($2.39bln).\n\nHowever, Grayscale, which had nearly $29bln in AUM, ended up seeing significant outflows, as much as $12bln, as investors finally got the chance to get their money out of this product, which was closed prior to being turned into an ETF and trading at a steep discount to BTC's price. GBTC now has just over $20bln in AUM, as per YCharts.\n\nGBTC was a major problem for Bitcoin, acting as an anchor on the ETF and price performance. But when it comes to Ethereum, Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) might not be as big of a problem due to having only $10.89bln in AUM.\n\nIn fact, ETHE\u2019s AUM jumped over the last few days as investors rushed in to get their hands on ETHE at a discount before its potential conversion into an ETF. The ETHE discount has already been contracting, currently at 6.66%. In April, ETHE was trading at a 26% discount to spot ETH price, and right at the end of 2022, the discount was at its highest at 59.6%. So, if ETHE pulls a similar move like GBTC, this discount will narrow even further.\n\nAdditionally, while Grayscale didn\u2019t launch its Bitcoin Mini Trust until after converting its Trust into an ETF, the asset manager has already submitted a Form S-1 for its new spot Ethereum ETF, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, as well as filed Schedule 14C for its existing ETHE and how it will seed the new mini trust.\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETF has clearly paved the road for Ethereum ETF, now all the speculation and activity surrounding Ethereum ETF is helping the largest cryptocurrency with Spot Bitcoin ETFs resuming their inflows. On Tuesday, all 11 ETFs saw a total of $305.7mln in inflows, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT accounting for 95% of it \u2014 the highest since April 5. Even GBTC has been seeing inflows for the last few days.\n\nEthereum co-founder and CEO of Consensys Joe Lubin sees Ethereum ETF approval as a \u201cfloodgate\u201d of demand for the second largest crypto that will then lead to a supply crunch. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether\u201d through the ETFs, said Lubin in an interview with DL News, adding that this could be a \u201cprofound watershed moment\u201d for the entire industry.\n\nExpected ETH ETF Flows\n\nETH enthusiasts are excited for obvious reasons, and the market has begun forecasting just how much a Spot Ethereum ETF can really see in inflows. Bloomberg\u2019s Balchunas sees Ether ETFs getting \u201c10-15% of the assets of the BTC ETFs.\u201d With Spot Bitcoin ETFs having accumulated over $35bln in total AUM, this puts ETH ETF inflows at about $3-$5bln. Standard Chartered anticipates even bigger demand.\n\n\u201cAs a percentage of market cap, it is similar to our estimates of inflows to Bitcoin ETFs, which are proving accurate.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, in an interview with The Block\n\n\n\nDuring the interview, he also said he is \u201c80% to 90%\u201d of Ether ETF approvals this week.\n\nIn a report earlier, which called for Spot Ethereum ETF approval on May 23, Standard Chartered analysts predicted an estimated inflow of 2.39-9.15 million ETH, which amounts to between $15 and $45 billion in its first year.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t all. They also projected ETH prices to maintain a 5.4% price ratio with BTC this year. Based on their Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000 by the end of 2024, Ethereum\u2019s price can rally as high as $8,000. For next year's end, the bank estimates an even higher price for BTC at $200K, which would imply an ETH price of $14K by the end of 2025.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bernstein analysts also called for a similar jump in ETH prices to Bitcoin\u2019s since its ETF approval, noting the former\u2019s free float and supply as more attractive than the trillion-dollar asset. The analysts said:\n\n\u201cETH supply remains constrained by sticky investors and utility locking supply in financial smart contracts.\u201d\n\nTalking about this supply crunch, Bernstein analysts explained in their report that since ETH\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), the crypto asset has been deflationary. On top of that, 66% of ETH hasn\u2019t moved in the last year, while ETH exchange supply is at an all-time low. Then there is 38% of ETH locked in staking, L2s, and smart contracts \u2014 something that is \u201cunique to programmable ETH and not seen with Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAccording to Standard Chartered\u2019s Kendrick, the news of Ether ETF \u201ccomes at an opportune moment for BTC,\u201d as the approval of Spot Ethereum ETF will not \u201cfurther legitimize the sector\u201d but will also be positive for BTC and will send its price to fresh highs as early as this weekend.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nThe SEC's approval of several spot Ethereum ETFs marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market. Major players like Grayscale, Bitwise, iShares, VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Invesco, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are now set to launch these ETFs, making it easy for investors to invest in Ethereum. However, the SEC has stipulated that these ETFs can't start trading until their registration statements are officially declared effective. This rule ensures that all regulatory standards are met before the ETFs become available to the public.\n\nOverall, this approval is expected to boost market activity and confidence in the digital asset space. And as the ETFs begin trading, the impact on Ethereum's price and the broader crypto market will be closely watched."
