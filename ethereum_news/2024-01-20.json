        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLittle over a week since the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), and the crypto markets are suffering.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has shed more than 10% of its value, according to CoinGecko. The biggest digital coin by market cap is now priced at $41,002.\n\nLast week, it was closing in on $49,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs have been a roaring success\u2014with BlackRock's iShares ETF collecting over $1 billion in assets under management.\n\nSo, why the dip in price? It probably has something to do with investors cashing out their gains from the initial ETF hype.\n\nSome analysts said that ETF approval had already been \"priced in.\" This likely means that traders and investors were unlikely to continue buying after the approval was made official.\n\nThe rest of the crypto market has been hit hard over the past week, too. Solana (SOL) has shed over 7% of its value in the past week and is priced at $92.38.\n\nWhile Avalanche (AVAX) is down by more than 14%, trading hands for $32.82. Both assets had done very well in December as they attracted institutional investor interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH), the second-biggest digital coin, has lost 8% of its value in the past week. It's now priced at $2,466.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 10 spot BTC ETFs, the crypto sphere is now awaiting spot ETH ETFs to drop.\n\nWall Street's top regulator on Thursday pushed back its deadline for a decision on Fidelity's proposed spot Ethereum ETF to March 5, leading to a price dip in the asset.\n\nThe entire crypto market now stands at $1.7 trillion, having dropped by 2.8% in the last 24 hours."

        "title": "What Are Parallelized EVMs? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, allowing multiple transactions to be executed at the same time rather than sequentially.\n\nThe blockchain landscape is constantly evolving to overcome limitations and unlock new possibilities. One of the latest innovations to address scalability within the Ethereum ecosystem is Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs).\n\nRead on to learn about parallelized EVMs and the potential impact of parallelization on Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nWhat Are Parallelized EVMs?\n\nTo understand parallelized EVMs, let\u2019s first grasp the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThe EVM allows for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum Network. It provides the infrastructure vital to all transactions happening on the blockchain. The growing adoption of Ether and other Ethereum-based tokens strains the EVM, leading to calls for its scaling.\n\nOne intervention that\u2019s gaining traction is parallelized EVMs.\n\nParallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (PEVMs) enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency by allowing multiple transactions to be executed simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\nImagine them as supercharged versions of their predecessor capable of handling multiple transactions together. This approach is crucial in tackling the blockchain trilemma as it significantly reduces latency, boosting transaction throughput.\n\nSome of the front runners in the PEVM adoption are the Sei network, Neon, and Monad. The Sei Network went live in August 2023, attracting roughly 29,000 active users. Neon is also active and working on integrating Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) into the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, Monard is yet to launch despite being production-ready.\n\nHow Do Parallelized EVMs Work?\n\nPEVMs leverage the power of parallel processing to achieve timely and scalable transactions.\n\nUnlike the typical EVMs that handle transactions back-to-back, PEVMs split transactions into smaller, independent tasks that can be tackled simultaneously. This means setting up different points for the concurrent handling of multiple trades.\n\nThere are many approaches to parallel processing, but two popular ones stand out:\n\nSharding : Imagine dividing the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, self-contained shards, each with its own EVM. Transactions are then distributed across these shards, allowing for independent and simultaneous processing.\n\nRollups: These batch transactions off the main Ethereum chain, processing them on a separate layer, and then re-submitting them to the mainnet for verification. This significantly reduces the burden on the main Ethereum network, leading to faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nThe Potential Impact of Parallelized EVMs on Ethereum\n\nPEVMs can significantly reduce transaction times and fees by removing network bottlenecks, making Ethereum more user-friendly and accessible to developers and users alike.\n\nWith PEVMs paving the way for faster and cheaper transactions, Ethereum can potentially handle a much larger volume of activity. This opens the door to widespread adoption of dApps and DeFi, bringing the power of blockchain to a broader audience.\n\nThe increased processing power of PEVMs could unleash a wave of more complex and resource-intensive dApps, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible on Ethereum. Applications that might have previously been impractical on the blockchain could become feasible.\n\nAdditionally, making improvements on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet could significantly impact other Ethereum layers. L2 scaling solutions could gain more attention, leading to further development and adoption among users.\n\nPEVMs, however, also present a possible downside. The technical complexity required to implement parallelized EVMs might lead to centralization if only a few big players can implement it. They could also present backward compatibility and transition challenges to existing smart contracts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Parallelized EVMs\n\nPEVMs could hold so much promise for crypto enthusiasts. But like any technology, it could have its drawbacks too.\n\nPros\n\nReduced transaction latency: Devolving transaction handling to many units hastens their confirmation. Users will no longer have to endure lengthy completion times due to network clogging.\n\nLower transaction fees: PEVMs streamline transactions, eliminating the need to pay more for prioritized exchanges, which makes transaction fees more affordable.\n\nEnhanced Interoperability: PEVM projects such as Neon are working on bringing Ethereum dApps to Solana. Such initiatives will make it easy for users to interact with their peers on different networks without migrating to their platforms.\n\nCons\n\nIncreased complexity: Implementing and maintaining robust PEVMs can be technically demanding. As such, developers and users may face a steep learning curve.\n\nPotential security risks: Parallel processing introduces new synchronization and coordination challenges, increasing the likelihood of bugs and errors with improper implementation\n\nFinal Word\n\nParallelized EVMs are the latest attempt at achieving Ethereum scalability. By introducing parallel processing capabilities, PEVMs open the doors to various applications, from real-time financial transactions to seamless cross-chain exchanges. However, these novel projects require meticulous development and rigorous security edits to ensure stability."

        "content": "Crypto analytics firm Kaiko says that speculative fervor on Ethereum (ETH) hasn\u2019t yet kicked off, despite being well off its 2022 lows.\n\nIn a new report, Kaiko says that Bitcoin has benefited from the hype surrounding the approval of BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, but that speculation on an Ethereum ETF has not yet begun.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently decided to delay its decision on banking giant Fidelity\u2019s spot market Ethereum ETF application until March.\n\nSays Kaiko,\n\n\u201cWhile there is some hype around ETH ETF applications, the data suggest that aggressive speculation hasn\u2019t yet begun. ETH trade volume has spiked, but derivatives markets have lacked the telltale signs of traders positioning for a rally. ETH futures ETFs have also had a slow few months of trading.\n\nETH and BTC correlation has sunk to multi-year lows as each asset matures and develops its own narratives. While ETFs were one of the most catalyzing narratives in BTC\u2019s history, it remains to be seen whether ETH will be able to replicate this. However, ETH has many narratives it can lean on; if ETFs don\u2019t spur enthusiasm, perhaps new Layer-2s or the success of EigenLayer and restaking can.\u201d\n\nKaiko says that derivatives data also indicates that recent ETH moves have largely been driven by spot markets rather than by perpetual futures, which the firm says provides evidence that traders are not using leverage in anticipation of an ETH ETF.\n\n\u201cSeptember and October marked a low point in futures markets, with aggregated open interest (in USD) falling more than 20% from its summer levels. At this time, there was little price movement and funding rates were neutral\u2026\n\nPost-BTC approval, funding rates have reset to neutral, while open interest has surged ahead of price, indicative of increased shorting. Even still, we have not yet seen a major build-up in open interest that is typical of a bull market.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,473.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Among other catalysts, Ethereum (ETH) has possible ETF approval ahead. This might be an amazing catalyst for the next ETH rally.\n\nIt should be noted that Ethereum (ETH) is getting closer to EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding upgrade activation. It is set to change the game in L2s and make them more resource-efficient.\n\nAs such, the analyst is positive about the potential of Total2, an indicator of cumulative cryptocurrency markets capitalization excluding Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) indicator is due to go through \"maximum pain,\" the trader concluded.\n\nLegal status of Ether is crucial for ETH ETF approval\n\nIn January 2024, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is losing momentum. After registering a local high over 55% on Jan. 9, it lost 7.5% (4.6 points) in less than 10 days.\n\nEthereum ETF is one of the most anticipated events for the cryptocurrency segment in 2024. The community and experts are moderately optimistic about its potential approval.\n\nHowever, the court processes between the U.S. SEC and crypto exchanges over illegal securities offering might affect the timeline of the ETH ETF approval.\n\nTogether with other large-cap altcoins, Ether is one of the tokens the SEC claimed to be unregistered securities."

        "content": "Ethereum continues to be the number one blockchain among crypto developers, with more than 70% of new contract codes first deployed on the network, according to the latest report by Electric Capital.\n\nAlso, there has been a spread in the distribution of developers globally, with more crypto devs living outside North America, as opposed to steady growth recorded in regions such as Latin America and Western Africa.\n\nMore Devs Involved in Multi-Chains\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s 2023 Crypto Developer Report revealed that most of the smart contract code launched on the Ethereum network is unique, while 71% of contracts are first deployed on Ethereum, making it the top blockchain choice for developers.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of multi-chain developers expanded in 2023. Based on the report, multi-chain developers grew from three percent in 2015 to 34% in 2023, signaling a growth of over 10x in eight years.\n\nIt is also no surprise to see the cross-pollination of developers across Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. Such blockchains include BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and several layer 2 networks. These chains all use the same smart contract logic as Ethereum.\n\nAccording to Electric Capital, cross-pollination occurs between BNB Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum, with all three chains sharing \u201cat least 30% of their multi-chain deployers with each other.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, BNB shares the largest number of multi-chain devs, with Ethereum at 39%, followed by Polygon at 36% and Arbitrum at 24%, while Avalanche is the lowest at 18%.\n\n40% of Developers Worked on Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2023\n\nIn all, a fourth of all blockchain developers deploy either on Ethereum or Bitcoin, with the latter accounting for a larger number of monthly active developers at 7,864 as of December 2023, which was, however, a 25% drop from over 10,400 the previous year,\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, recorded 1,071 monthly active developers, declining 19% from 1,322 in December 2022. Most of the decline came from part-time developers and those working on multi-chains, with the report noting that developers who focused solely on Bitcoin were likely to continue working on the network.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1000 developers have supported Bitcoin since 2017. The highest number of new developers joined the network in 2022, at over 2,700.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin transaction volumes skyrocketed in 2023 following the resurgence of Ordinals, only three percent of all Bitcoin developers worked on the project, while 40% were dedicated to Bitcoin layer 2 networks and other scaling solutions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, there were also over 9,300 monthly active developers working on the top 200 crypto ecosystems by market capitalization as of December 2023. The figure, however, is a 31% reduction from 2022 records.\n\nTotal Number of Blockchain Devs Fell By Almost a Quarter in 2023\n\nAs noted on Electric Capital\u2019s report, monthly active developers dropped 24% to 22,411 in 2023, from 29,611 the previous year, with newcomers less than one year in crypto contributing to a majority of the losses.\n\nMost of these developers with the least tenured experience came into the industry during the bull market and tended to leave during the bear market. The number of newcomers peaked in 2022 at over 90,000 after Bitcoin\u2019s value rose to more than $69,000 and the total market capitalization at nearly $3 trillion in November 2021\n\n\u201cNewcomers who joined in 2022 are the ones who churned and are driving the overall -24% developer loss.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, those who have been in crypto for at least over a year continue to grow and contribute to the ecosystem, with 75% of codes by such developers.\n\nBlockchain developers with more than one year of experience in the industry grew 16% in 2023, while their established colleagues \u2014 people over two years in crypto \u2014 grew 52% in the last five years, reaching an all-time high.\n\nThe report also touched on developer distribution globally, stating that 74% are located outside of North America, while the US lost 14% of its developer share since 2018, controlling only 26% in 2023.\n\nBlockchain developers, however, are growing in Latin America, Western Africa, South Asia, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe, increasing by 20% since 2018."

The latest update introduces several new features, including multichain support, an in-app web browser, a revamped visual design, and support for multi-party computation (MPC).\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon and BNB Chain. This integration allows users to easily manage and transfer assets across multiple blockchain networks from a single wallet. The new version of the Ronin wallet includes an in-app web browser that enables users to access decentralized applications (dApps) and interact with blockchain-based services directly from the wallet.\n\nThe wallet's visual design has been revamped to provide more detailed information on specific token activities and NFT information. Users can now easily view their asset balances, transaction history, and NFT collection in a more user-friendly interface.\n\nThe Ronin wallet now supports MPC, an optional security feature that allows users to divide their wallet's login information on the backend. This feature requires two or more pieces of login information instead of a single private key, enhancing the security of the wallet. When combined with a social login, the MPC feature can be used across multiple Ronin-based games like Axie Infinity and Pixels without creating separate wallets for each game.\n\nThe Ronin wallet upgrade is a significant step forward for the Ronin ecosystem, providing users with a more versatile and secure platform for managing their digital assets. The addition of multichain support and other features is likely to attract new users and further drive the adoption of the Ronin blockchain.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently on the edge, with increasing concerns that Grayscale might persist in selling its Bitcoin holdings. This fear stems from investors shedding shares of the GBTC ETF, sparking a wider market sell-off. Amid this downturn, the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum formed a local top at $2700 and entered a new correction phase.\n\nWithin a fortnight, the ETH price is down 9% to currently trading at $2467. Moreover, a notable development in Ethereum\u2019s Implied volatility and Option writing for coming months projects that future traders are expecting a prolonged correction for this asset.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Price Analysis: Expanding Channel Pattern Sets Dive Below $2400\n\nThe formation of an expanding channel pattern reflects increased uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA healthy retracement in ETH price keeps the overall trend bullish\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.63 Billion, indicating a 39% loss.\n\nThe last two months\u2019 recovery in Ethereum price can be followed using two diverging trendlines of an expanding channel pattern. Amid this rally, the coin price has showcased several rebounds from the two trendlines indicating the traders have taken a strict on the pattern structure.\n\nOn January 12th, the ETH price witnessed its latest reversal from the upper trendline, which initiated a new bear cycle within the channel. By the press time, the ETH price is trading at $2469, trying to hold above local support of $2400.\n\nAs per the recent data from Deribit Insight, Ethereum\u2019s implied volatility (IV), as measured by the Dvol proxy over the past week, experienced a significant decline, dropping from 64% to 47%, largely driven by structured call selling in both markets.\n\nThis indicates a change in strategy, with some investors possibly exiting long positions or engaging in overwriting strategies against their Ethereum holdings. Key transactions include the selling of 45,000 February calls with a strike price of $2,700, and 28,000 March calls at a $2,900 strike price. Additionally, there was a strategic move where 25,000 January $2,600 calls were covered, followed by the selling of April calls at a $2,900 strike.\n\nSuch Heavy Call selling at the aforementioned psychological level indicates the option traders believe the Ethereum coin is less likely to surge higher in coming months but rather remains in a sideways or correction trend.\n\nWill ETH Price Correction Hit $2000?\n\nIf the broader market continues to fuel selling pressure, the Ethereum price is likely to break the immediate support of $2400. The post-breakdown fall would tumble the price another 6.5% to retest the channel\u2019s lower trendline at $2300.\n\nThe rising trendline has acted as dynamic support for over two months and its possible breakdown intensifies the supply pressure.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.\n\nThe breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.\n\nThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.\n\nFor a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.\n\nSolana paints reversal pattern\n\nSolana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.\n\nThe significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.\n\nSuch a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.\n\nThe immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.\n\nEthereum momentum decreasing\n\nEthereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.\n\nThe provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.\n\nThe 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.\n\nMarket participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey."

In comparison, Ethereum\u2019s figure stood at $5 billion.\n\nCardano whales have been quite active for the past few months. $13B in large transactions (>$100k) is being settled on Cardano daily on average. A significant amount, if you compare it to Ethereum\u2019s $5B 7-day average. pic.twitter.com/8rjeQZaonU \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 18, 2024\n\nCardano has also made progress on the non-fungible token field, with an NFT sales volume of over $7.6 million for the last 30 days. Ethereum might be a leader with approximately $341 million, but this actually represents a 23% decline on a monthly basis.\n\nDespite the aforementioned developments, Cardano\u2019s ADA has performed worse than ETH as of late. The former currently trades at $0.50 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), or a 14% plunge on a weekly scale. ETH is hovering around $2,470 and is down 5% for the same period.\n\nHowever, some experts think ADA could be on the verge of a rally, taking into account the importance of several upcoming events.\n\nDan Gambardello (Founder of Crypto Capital Venture) outlined the Coinbase v. SEC lawsuit as a major catalyst, suggesting that a victory for the company might trigger a \u201cmega altcoin run.\u201d\n\nRecall that the regulator sued the exchange last summer, accusing it of breaching several laws and offering trading services with alleged unregistered securities such as ADA, SOL, MATIC, and more.\n\nThose curious to check other Cardano price predictions can take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency analysts are currently divided on the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to Ethereum (ETH), its closest counterpart in market capitalization ranking.\n\nOne prominent analyst, known by the handle @hedge__x on X has predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s price will experience an upward trajectory in the current market cycle.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the forecast comes with a caution \u2013 the analyst suggests that despite the optimism, many investors might find themselves disappointed if the peak only reaches $100,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Ascent Signals Potential\n\nAmidst the varied sentiments surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s projected peak, there is a prevailing belief in the crypto space that Ethereum (ETH) holds significant upside potential.\n\nThe analyst highlighted Ethereum as a potentially more lucrative investment compared to Bitcoin. Similar predictions were made at the start of January that Ethereum would reach $10,000 which prompted a series of debates and analysis.\n\nThis perspective is anchored in the anticipation of several catalysts, prominently the potential introduction of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) product for Ethereum. The sentiment echoes through the crypto community, suggesting that while Bitcoin may experience a peak at $100,000, Ethereum is poised for more substantial gains.\n\nThe ongoing discussion around Bitcoin\u2019s peak performance and Ethereum\u2019s potential rise highlights the complex dynamics that shape the perceptions of analysts and investors in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nFor instance, Samson Mow recently made a big claim on the X platform in his Silver comparison as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold.\u201d In the post, he also took a jab at Ethereum, comparing it to the link between silver and gold. He even made a direct claim that Ethereum is the \u201cstupid man\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBrighter Upsides for ETH\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of the cryptocurrency market, analysts and investors diligently scrutinize multiple factors to make informed predictions and investment decisions. According to some market analysts, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to overtake Bitcoin as the dominant player in the market in 2024.\n\nRegulatory developments, technological advancements, and market trends are among the critical aspects under constant observation. The overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is alluded to by the analyst @hedge__x\u2019s reference of \u201cTotal2\u201d in his analysis.\n\nAs debates rages on in the crypto community, attention will be on Ethereum (ETH), especially as the protocol is undergoing one of its most important upgrades thus far \u2013 the Dencun Upgrade.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

However, it raises the question of whether this has influenced the overall transaction volume on these networks.\n\nSui and Solana take in the Ethereum flow\n\nWormhole data showed that around $370 million in liquidity shifted away from Ethereum in the last month. Sui and Solana accounted for about 90% of this outflow.\n\nPresently, these two networks continue to dominate, with an Ethereum outflow totaling over $106.2 million. Sui received around $68 million, while Solana received approximately $27 million, making up a combined 89% of the outflow from Ethereum.\n\nAnalyzing the Sui and Solana volume\n\nA recent analysis of Sui\u2019s volume on DefiLlama showed a significant uptick in the past few days. Examining the chart reveals that the volume witnessed in January surpassed that of the preceding three months.\n\nThe upward trend peaked on 13th January, reaching over 76 million, marking the highest point in months. As of this writing, the volume was around 44 million.\n\nNotably, Sui\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL), despite a recent dip from around $344 million to $322 million, remained at its historically highest level.\n\nConversely, Solana has experienced a shift in volume trends. While the network\u2019s volume increased towards the end of the year, it has witnessed a recent decline. Presently, the volume is over $740 million, reflecting a decrease but still outpacing Sui\u2019s volume.\n\nSOL and SUI post different price trends\n\nAnalyzing the daily price trend of Sui showed an uptrend that peaked around 15th January, reaching around $1.3 with a notable 9% increase.\n\nDuring this rise, the price entered the overbought zone, as evidenced by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). After this peak, the price experienced declines, causing the RSI to dip below 60.\n\nAt present, the price has decreased by nearly 5%, trading at around $1.1.\n\nRead Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIn contrast, Solana has dipped below the neutral line on its RSI, reflecting a decline in the price over the past three days.\n\nAs of this writing, SOL was trading at around $92, marking a decrease of over 1% in its price."

This downturn saw Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fall from a high of $49,000 to $40,300, marking a 17.85% loss.\n\nThis selling pressure is largely attributed to Grayscale beginning to sell its Bitcoin holdings in response to investors offloading shares of the GBTC ETF. The outflow of $2.2 billion from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and concerns about the Bitcoin ETF being a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event have led most major cryptocurrencies into a correction phase.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite this, several industry experts view the current downturn as a natural correction, necessary for the major cryptocurrencies to gather strength for future growth.\n\nOn the Bitcoin weekly time frame chart, there\u2019s a notable struggle to sustain above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, around $42,300. This effort to reclaim 50% of the lost value from the recent downtrend reflects a growing conviction among market bulls and a weakening hold by bears on the asset.\n\nWith a positive outlook for the near future, the following cryptocurrencies Ethereum(ETH), Solana(SOL), and Luna Classic (LUNC) can offer suitable pullback opportunities to traders.\n\nWhy Ethereum (ETH) Price Nearing a 22% Breakout Rally\n\nAmid the current downturn in the crypto market, the Ethereum price recently hit a local high of $2700 before starting a correction phase this week. The price now stands at $2487, reflecting a loss of 8.35% over the past two weeks.\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that this correction is contained within two converging trendlines, forming what appears to be a pennant pattern. If this pattern proves accurate, it suggests that the current correction phase could be a consolidation period, allowing buyers to gather strength for a potential upward movement.\n\nAdding to this bullish perspective is a notable observation by Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, regarding Ethereum\u2019s staking activity. On January 18th, he highlighted in a tweet that 24% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is now staked, with only 11% available on exchanges. Contrary to expectations of significant unstaking post the Shapella upgrade, the staking rate continues to rise.\n\nGiven these technical and on-chain developments, the ETH price might break through the pennant\u2019s upper trendline, indicating an end to the correction phase. This breakout could potentially spark a rally of around 22%, pushing the price beyond the $3000 mark..\n\nNew Found Support Bolsters Solana (SOL) Price Rally to $125, But There\u2019s More\n\nSolana, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has displayed impressive resilience amid the broader market\u2019s downturn, holding steadily above the crucial $85 mark. This level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, signaling that buyers are maintaining a strong foothold.\n\nAs highlighted in a recent analysis by Coingape, the Solana price correction is shaping the \u2018handle\u2019 of a larger Cup-and-Handle pattern, a bullish chart formation. This suggests that the ongoing retracement could rejuvenate the bullish momentum, potentially driving the SOL price up by 35% to breach the critical neckline resistance at $125.\n\nA successful breakout from this neckline, particularly if backed by a daily candle closing above it, would be a robust indication of a trend reversal. Such a development could set the Solana price on a path towards a significant target of $255.\n\nTerra Classic (LUNC) Price Wavering In a Mark-or-Break Scenario\n\nThe Terra Classic (LUNC) price has been in a corrective phase since December 2023, with its price dropping from a high of $0.00028 to its current value of $0.000118, indicating a substantial 60% loss.\n\nThe coin found crucial support at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level around $0.0000102, changing its course from a downward trend to sideways. The daily chart shows that this consolidation has evolved into a symmetrical triangle pattern, typically a sign of the continuation of the existing trend.\n\nA breakdown below this triangle\u2019s lower support trendline might lead to further price declines for LUNC, potentially towards $0.0000975 and then $0.0000842. Alternatively, a rare upside break from this pattern could signal an attempt by buyers to regain bullish momentum.\n\nIf buyers manage a breakout, they could be looking at an upward rally towards resistance levels at $0.000147, followed by $0.000173, providing a much-needed boost to reverse the bearish sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Jamie Dimon equates Bitcoin to Pet Rock; Howard Marks compares it with gold - DLNews",
        "content": "Bitcoin: Pet Rock or gold?\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon referred to Bitcoin as a \u201cPet Rock\u201d while speaking in Davos, Switzerland, at a World Economic Forum event earlier this week, Fortune reported.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t remember, Pet Rocks were a brief fad in the \u201870s when many people were moved to fork over four dollars for a ventilated cardboard box containing a rock.\n\nMeanwhile, Oaktree Capital Management founder Howard Marks speaking on Bloomberg\u2019s Merryn Talks Money podcast, compared Bitcoin with gold in that there is a limited supply of both, and they are worth only what others are willing to pay for them. \u201cGold is a little more tried and true, but it also lacks any kind of analytical raison d\u2019etre,\u201d Marks noted, unlike real estate, companies, stocks or bonds, all of which offer returns of some sort.\n\nStill, while Dimon remains a Bitcoin sceptic and said he will speak no more on the subject going forward, he acknowledged seeing utility and promise in smart contracts enabled by blockchain technologies on Ethereum.\n\nDimon said: \u201cThere\u2019s a cryptocurrency which might actually do something. You can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data, tokenising things that you do something with.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF is first to $1bn AUM\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, called iShares Bitcoin Trust or IBIT, reached $1 billion in assets under management in about a week of trading, the first among 11 newly launched ETFs to do so, Reuters reported, citing JPMorgan data.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the ETFs tracking the biggest cryptocurrency last week, and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT had accumulated $1.07 billion in assets under management by January 17.\n\nRobert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s head of digital assets, told Fortune that the considerable inflows to IBIT demonstrated strong investor demand.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF.\u201d\n\nHong Kong planning spot crypto EFTs\n\nHong Kong is planning a more flexible approach than the US towards spot crypto ETFs, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s proposed regulations for spot crypto ETFs would allow both cash and in-kind subscriptions. In Hong Kong, dealers will be allowed to use Bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem the ETF\u2019s shares, while in the US, cash must be used, the report said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.23% today at $41,530.80.\n\nEthereum is down 0.82% today at $2,469.63.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading"

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Crypto to Buy Hand Over Fist - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After skyrocketing in value last year, Solana will be looking for a repeat performance in 2024.\n\nBitcoin may be getting all the headlines in the crypto industry these days, but there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies that have the potential to outperform it this year, including Solana (SOL -1.55%).\n\nSolana started 2023 trading around $10, and ended the year trading around $100 after briefly hitting a peak around $120 in late December. While it will be difficult to duplicate that performance in 2024, there are two big reasons why I think Solana is exactly the type of crypto that you should be buying hand over fist right now.\n\nSolana is the next Ethereum\n\nMost importantly, Solana is finally starting to fulfill its promise as \"the next Ethereum.\" Ethereum is still the acknowledged market leader in nearly every blockchain niche, from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). But Solana now appears to be gaining market share at Ethereum's expense. At the end of last year, for example, Solana started to post higher NFT sales volume and decentralized exchange trading volume than Ethereum for the first time ever. And I think that momentum will carry over into 2024.\n\nHigh-profile institutional investors are starting to buy into this narrative of Solana as \"the next Ethereum.\" Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, appeared on CNBC at the end of the year, extolling the virtues of Solana as a faster, more cost-effective version of Ethereum.\n\nAs this investment thesis gains momentum, it could lead to more institutional investors putting their money into Solana. At the end of last year, CoinShares (which tracks crypto inflows and outflows) found that institutional investors were moving money out of Ethereum and into Solana. That's obviously going to help push up the price of Solana.\n\nSolana's mobile strategy is taking off\n\nFor the past 18 months, Solana has been working on a mobile crypto strategy. It all started back in June 2022, when Solana announced it was working on a \"crypto phone\" that would be optimized for Solana blockchain users. That was followed up by the official launch of the Saga smartphone priced at $1,000 in April 2023. And now, in January 2024, Solana appears ready to launch a second, more budget-friendly version of the Saga.\n\nIt's easy to see how physical hardware products such as the Saga could spark long-term growth for Solana. They could lead to more developers migrating over to the Solana blockchain ecosystem and the launch of hardware products could be a fantastic way to onboard \"crypto-curious\" people who have a difficult time conceptualizing blockchain technology. Products such as the Saga could eventually become a pathway to onboard millions of new users into the world of Web3 and decentralized applications.\n\nThe big question, of course, is whether the world really needs a $1,000 smartphone that is optimized for crypto. The major selling point of the Saga was the inclusion of a crypto wallet within the phone itself. That's great if you're buying and selling NFTs, or if you're regularly buying and selling crypto tokens on decentralized crypto exchanges. But if you're an average user, it's easy to see why you might not want to replace your current smartphone anytime soon.\n\nWill this Bitcoin diversion last?\n\nThe launch of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could have broad ramifications beyond just Bitcoin. They could significantly impact the amount of new money that flows into Solana.\n\nIn the first two weeks of 2024, the flow of money into Solana has slowed to a drip. According to CoinShares, around the time of the spot Bitcoin ETF launch, Bitcoin accounted for a staggering 98% of all investor inflows into crypto.\n\nMaybe this is a short-term phenomenon. But what if it's not? For that reason, I'm keeping a close eye on institutional inflows into Solana over the next few weeks.\n\nAll in all, Solana looks good\n\nAnd, of course, there are many investors convinced that Ethereum will be able to fend off any advances from Solana and retain its position as the preeminent Layer-1 blockchain. There's also hype now building around a potential spot Ethereum ETF. If that ever gets approved, the thinking goes, it could have the same type of impact on Ethereum as the spot Bitcoin ETF has had on Bitcoin.\n\nThat being said, I'm still convinced that Solana is now a better long-term play than Ethereum. Solana has superior technology, as well as a potential game changer in mobile crypto. As a result, I'm bullish on Solana."

        "title": "Ethereum Boss Unleashes: Buterin Blasts Crypto Firms For 'Foundational Sin' - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Renowned Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, has ignited a fervent debate within the crypto industry, urging stakeholders to prioritize transparency and accountability. Drawing attention to recent governance challenges, Buterin\u2019s insights shed light on a critical need for open dialogue and the industry\u2019s responsibility to rectify its past missteps.\n\nEthereum Founder: Address Crypto Industry\u2019s Governance Issues\n\nButerin\u2019s reflections were prompted by two prominent incidents that have rattled the crypto sphere: the controversy surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried and governance issues within the OpenAI board. However, his focus extends beyond these specific cases, delving into the broader challenges faced by the tech and crypto sectors.\n\nCentral to Buterin\u2019s argument is the call to address the industry\u2019s governance shortcomings, which he refers to as a \u201cfoundational sin.\u201d He emphasizes that the core issue lies not only in the controversial actions themselves but also in the lack of transparent and accountable dialogue with the public. This failure to foster trust and engagement has far-reaching consequences for the industry\u2019s credibility and long-term sustainability.\n\nI feel like my response survived ok: my main critique in both cases was \u201crespect public legitimacy more\u201d (Sam\u2019s sin was the fraud plus the \u201cwoke shibboleths\u201d thing, the OpenAI board\u2019s sin was making a sudden huge decision and feeling entitled to not explain itself to the public) \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 20, 2024\n\nThe FTX scandal serves as a timely example of the consequences of this foundational sin. Buterin underscores the importance of substantiated evidence before passing swift judgment on high-ranking CEOs involved in deceptive behavior. The absence of a governing board at FTX highlights the critical need for robust oversight mechanisms to ensure checks and balances within corporate structures.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,409 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nButerin: Rectify \u2018Foundational Sin\u2019\n\nButerin\u2019s astute analysis examines the intricacies of corporate governance, especially within the ever-evolving ethereum and crypto landscape. He argues that rectifying the industry\u2019s foundational sin requires a paradigm shift that values public trust and legitimacy. Instances like Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraudulent activities and the opaque decision-making process at OpenAI serve as cautionary tales, exposing the pressing need for improved governance practices in the tech and crypto sectors.\n\nThe key question arises: How can crypto companies restore trust, transparency, and accountability? Buterin proposes a governance model that not only complies with legal mandates but also genuinely engages with the community. By fostering open dialogue and involving stakeholders, companies can rebuild public trust and address the industry\u2019s governance challenges head-on.\n\nWhile the Ethereum founder\u2019s vision has garnered support from many quarters, skeptics question the practicality of implementing such a governance model in the complex crypto landscape.\n\nAs the crypto industry grapples with these profound challenges, the discussions ignited by Buterin\u2019s insights on transparency and accountability have become pivotal to its evolution.\n\nFeatured image from Getty Images"

        "content": "Despite the major bear markets and fluctuations in price that Ripple coin (XRP) is facing, the cryptocurrency has managed to put up well, showing a strong resilience. A speculation about a Blackrock XRP ETF approval after Ethereum came up online last year, leaving most investors wondering what will become of XRP\u2019s price, however, this news was later debunked as fake news.\n\nHowever, this year, the CEO of Ripple foresees an expansion of cryptocurrency-related ETFs to cryptos like Ripple, following the establishment of Bitcoin ETFs. Notwithstanding, Ripple coin still shows a promising price outlook just like Ethereum. On the other hand, Pullix is positioned for a higher rally as over 11,000 users joined its presale in a month.\n\nRipple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse Foresees ETFs Approval for Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nRipple (XRP) CEO is optimistic about the approval of various Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, expecting them to pave the way for similar cryptocurrency investment products in 2024.\n\nWhile he didn't explicitly predict approval for an ETF for Ripple, Garlinghouse anticipates that an Ether ETF will likely receive the green light soon.\n\nIn another talk with Thinking Crypto, James Seyffart doubts the chances of a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. by 2024, attributing it to the unresolved Ripple and SEC lawsuit and the absence of a comparable regulatory framework for Ripple.\n\nHe suggests that only after the Ripple and SEC case concludes and U.S. crypto regulations improve might a spot XRP ETF be considered, possibly in 2025, resolidifying Ripple as one of the top crypto coins.\n\nJP Morgan\u2019s Prospect of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF Approval in the U.S.\n\nMarket optimism surrounds the potential approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF by May 23, the SEC's deadline for the Ark 21Shares application. JPMorgan gives a 50% chance for approval, influenced by Ethereum being seen as the next ETF candidate after Bitcoin.\n\nSome believe the SEC's omission of Ethereum in recent lawsuits hints at potential commodity classification, a key for ETF approval. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou express skepticism, seeing less than a 50% chance for approval by May.\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum price this year is tied to hopes for an ETF approval, providing U.S. investors exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership. Ethereum price is currently on a weekly range of $2,450 to $2,600\n\nThe shift in how Ethereum operates and the ongoing legal issues with the SEC regarding certain exchange services are making it tough to approve an Ethereum ETF until these matters are resolved.\n\nPullix\u2019s (PLX) DeFi Potential, Innovative Features, and Projected Market Growth\n\nWith over 11,000 participants, the Pullix (PLX) presale has garnered substantial interest in its DeFi market potential. Pullix stands out by merging features from centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, aiming to create a platform that overcomes common issues in online trading, such as asset limitations.\n\nThis innovative approach positions Pullix uniquely, allowing trading across various asset classes, including forex, gold, and cryptocurrencies, leveraging the significant $6.6 trillion daily volume of the forex market.\n\nThe presale has seen 70+ million PLX tokens sold, with the current value at $0.08\u2014a 100% increase from its initial price. Experts anticipate a potential 280% increase before the presale concludes, ranking PLX among top crypto coins this year.\n\nWithin the Pullix ecosystem, exciting features include Copy Trading, enabling users to replicate successful trades, and a Lending Protocol, providing a flexible money market for lending and borrowing.\n\nThe PLX native token serves a dual purpose as a trading tool and as part of a revenue-sharing model. Stakers stand to receive a portion of Pullix's daily revenue positioning PLX as a good crypto to buy for gains. Furthermore, users can stake various currencies like DOGE and ETH for a fixed interest rate.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

        "title": "Crafting tokens & ICOs on Ethereum: The Ether Alchemist - Guardian Nigeria",
        "content": "Ethereum has emerged as a revolutionary force in the world of blockchain technology, offering a platform for decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and, of course, tokens. This knowledge is invaluable for those keen on navigating the complexities of the blockchain world. While Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, the creation and management of tokens have become an integral part of this ecosystem. This article explores the art of crafting tokens and conducting Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) on Ethereum, shedding light on the various aspects of this fascinating and rapidly evolving domain. For individuals looking to broaden their understanding of investing concepts, Ethereum Code an investment education firm, offers comprehensive insights and guidance.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Tokens\n\nWhat are Ethereum Tokens?\n\nEthereum tokens are digital assets built on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike Ether (ETH), which serves as the native currency and fuel for the network, tokens on Ethereum are unique digital assets with various use cases. These tokens can represent anything from ownership in a project to access rights, loyalty points, or even a unique piece of digital art.\n\nERC-20 Tokens: The Standard for Fungible Tokens\n\nERC-20 tokens have become the industry standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum. They adhere to a common set of rules and functions, allowing for easy integration with wallets, exchanges, and other services. These tokens are interchangeable with one another, making them ideal for use as traditional currencies or tradable assets. Examples of popular ERC-20 tokens include USDC, DAI, and Chainlink (LINK).\n\nERC-721 Tokens: NFTs and the World of Non-Fungible Assets\n\nERC-721 tokens, known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), represent a unique class of digital assets. Each NFT is distinct and indivisible, making it suitable for representing ownership of rare collectibles, digital art, and unique digital assets. The Ethereum blockchain has witnessed a surge in NFT popularity, with NFT sales reaching remarkable highs.\n\nICOs on Ethereum: An Overview\n\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) Explained\n\nICOs are a fundraising method that gained tremendous popularity on the Ethereum platform. In an ICO, a project or startup offers a new cryptocurrency token to the public in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Ether. These tokens often serve as a means of participating in or supporting the project\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum in Revolutionizing Fundraising through ICOs\n\nEthereum transformed the fundraising landscape by enabling the creation of custom tokens and providing a secure platform for ICOs. The network\u2019s robust and widely adopted smart contract functionality made it a preferred choice for new projects looking to access a global pool of potential investors.\n\nNotable ICO Success Stories on Ethereum\n\nEthereum-based ICOs have seen significant success stories. Notable projects like Ethereum itself, which conducted a groundbreaking ICO in 2014, and projects like EOS, Tezos, and BAT, have all raised substantial amounts of capital through their ICOs. These projects have contributed to the growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCrafting Your Own Token on Ethereum\n\nThe Process of Creating a Custom Ethereum Token\n\nCreating a custom Ethereum token involves defining its characteristics, such as its name, symbol, and the total supply of tokens. This is typically done through smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the token embedded within them.\n\nSmart Contracts and Their Role in Token Creation\n\nSmart contracts play a pivotal role in token creation. They are self-executing pieces of code that govern the rules and behavior of the token. By utilizing smart contracts, token creators can ensure trustless and transparent token management.\n\nCustomization Options and Considerations When Designing Tokens\n\nToken creators can customize various aspects of their tokens, including the divisibility, supply, and governance features. It\u2019s essential to carefully consider these options and align them with the project\u2019s objectives and user expectations.\n\nLaunching an ICO on Ethereum\n\nThe Steps Involved in Launching a Successful ICO\n\nLaunching an ICO is a multi-step process that involves setting clear objectives, establishing legal compliance, creating a whitepaper, and executing a marketing and fundraising strategy. A successful ICO requires a well-thought-out plan and execution.\n\nRegulatory Challenges and Compliance Requirements\n\nThe ICO landscape is subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. It\u2019s crucial for projects to navigate these challenges by ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations of their target markets. This might involve KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, accredited investor requirements, and more.\n\nCase Studies of ICOs on Ethereum\n\nNumerous ICOs on Ethereum have seen varying degrees of success. Case studies of both successful and unsuccessful ICOs provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn\u2019t. Learning from these examples can help future projects navigate the ICO landscape more effectively.\n\nRisks and Challenges\n\nSecurity Concerns and Vulnerabilities in Token Creation\n\nToken creation and ICOs come with security risks, including vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the potential for hacking. Understanding these risks and implementing rigorous security measures is critical to safeguarding both the project and its investors.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Challenges Associated with ICOs\n\nLegal and regulatory challenges can vary greatly by jurisdiction. Navigating this landscape requires a deep understanding of local and international regulations, as non-compliance can result in legal repercussions.\n\nLessons from Past ICO Failures and Scams\n\nThe cryptocurrency space has witnessed its share of ICO failures and scams. Learning from these unfortunate incidents can help future projects make informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nThe Future of Tokenization and ICOs on Ethereum\n\nEvolving Trends in Tokenization and Fundraising\n\nThe field of tokenization and fundraising is constantly evolving. Emerging trends include decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, governance tokens, and Security Token Offerings (STOs). Understanding these trends is essential for staying relevant in the space.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum 2.0 in Shaping the Future\n\nEthereum 2.0, an upgrade to the Ethereum network, holds the potential to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. It\u2019s expected to have a profound impact on the future of tokenization and ICOs on Ethereum.\n\nPredictions and Prospects for Ethereum-based Projects\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem continues to expand with new projects, DApps, and decentralized services. The prospects for Ethereum-based projects remain promising as the technology matures and gains mainstream acceptance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Ethereum has played a pivotal role in advancing the blockchain ecosystem by providing a versatile environment for creating tokens and hosting ICOs. As technological and regulatory dynamics undergo continuous transformation, the processes of token crafting and ICO execution on the Ethereum network will persistently evolve, reshaping the landscape of fundraising and digital asset management. This ever-evolving space holds the promise of innovation, abundant investment prospects, and the need for entrepreneurs and developers to tackle emerging challenges.\n\n"

        "title": "Aave V3 Ready For Solana After This Crucial Vote Passed - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Aave community has overwhelmingly approved a proposal that will set the ball rolling for deploying Aave V3 on Solana, a smart contracts platform. The motion, put forward by the Neon Foundation and the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), passed with a majority vote of 83% based on results posted on January 21.\n\nSolana Fast Rising, DeFi Ecosystem Active\n\nSolana has been rapidly expanding, with its native currency, SOL, emerging as one of the top performers in 2023. To put it in perspective, SOL prices exploded from about $10 in 2023 to around $125 by the end of the year.\n\nThis surge saw SOL reverse losses of November 2022 while concurrently catalyzing events on the blockchain, spurring various activities, including the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT), and meme coin activities.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Red, Why BTC Could Tumble Below $40K\n\nOn the other hand, Aave has been expanding to multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks, emerging as one of the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to on-chain data from DeFiLlama on January 22, Aave manages over $6.9 billion worth of assets across ten chains. A big chunk, over 90%, comprises assets on Ethereum. Aave v3 has a total value locked (TVL) of $4.9 billion.\n\nAave V3 On Solana, What It Means\n\nThe TEMP CHECK proposers are keen on Aave v3 deploying on Solana, considering the blockchain\u2019s rapid growth in the past year. They observe that the blockchain\u2019s DeFi TVL and broad user base would likely benefit the lending and borrowing protocol, cementing its position as a market leader.\n\nIf Aave is deployed on Solana, the protocol will access the deep liquidity on the blockchain. At the same time, users will access Aave services more conveniently. Subsequently, the proposers reiterated this move will cement Aave\u2019s position as the leading liquidity market on-chain. Moreover, it will likely open up new opportunities for collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and other Neon EVM communities.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nXRP Crash Fears Mount As Whale Dumps 26 Million Tokens \u2013 Details 8 months ago\n\nNeon EVM is a cross-chain bridge for users to transfer assets between Ethereum and other blockchains. Through this bridge, Aave v3 will go live on Solana without any major reconfiguration of the protocol\u2019s codebase. Among the tokens that will be initially supported is SOL. Users will be free to borrow USDC, a stablecoin.\n\nThe passing of the TEMP CHECK also reflects Aave\u2019s ambition to expand across multiple blockchains beyond EVM networks. So far, Aave has been deployed on various platforms, including layer-2s like Arbitrum and Base, Avalanche, and Ethereum\u2019s sidechain, Polygon.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"
