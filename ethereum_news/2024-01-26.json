        "title": "Could a forthcoming Ethereum upgrade boost Ether\u2019s price? A recent study says yes - DLNews",
        "content": "The price of Ether is seen to increase in the weeks before major upgrades.\n\nA small group of contributors holds significant influence over key decisions regarding Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nThe increase in Ether's price is most significant in the weeks before final discussions regarding EIPs.\n\nEthereum\u2019s governance decisions have emerged as an underappreciated influence on prices of Ether.\n\nA recent study by a trio of academics shed light on this relationship, particularly regarding EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nAn Ethereum Improvement Proposal is a formal document suggesting new features or changes to the Ethereum blockchain that serves as a guideline for community consensus.\n\nThe study, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s decision-making process, uncovered a striking trend. In the periods leading up to final discussions of Core EIPs, Ether\u2019s price increased about 18%, and relative to Bitcoin it increased 12%.\n\nThe research also examined the concentration of power in Ethereum\u2019s governance, and found that a small group of developers and influencers hold significant sway over the EIP process.\n\nThe next major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, which is expected to reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2s, is on track to launch in late February.\n\nEthereum developers will run through tests for Dencun on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 30 and February 7.\n\nThe authors of the study were Cesare Fracassi and Moazzam Khoja at the University of Texas at Austin, and Fabian Sch\u00e4r at the University of Basel. The paper has yet to go through the academic peer-review process.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nData speaks volumes\n\nThe study analysed Ether\u2019s price trends during the final discussions and approvals of successful Core EIPs, looking at hourly price data from May 2016 to November 2023.\n\nOne of the most important findings was the 18% increase in Ether prices in the weeks preceding the last AllCoreDevs call before a major EIP.\n\nAn AllCoreDevs call is a regular meeting when Ethereum\u2019s core developers discuss and make decisions on EIPs.\n\nThis surge in prices was seen to reflect investors\u2019 evolving expectations about the likelihood of a proposal\u2019s approval, and its potential impact on the token\u2019s value.\n\nTo ensure an accurate analysis, the researchers focused on a specific period of 80 days, split equally before and after these meetings.\n\nEther\u2019s price began to increase, the study found, about 30 days before the crucial discussions.\n\nA clear pattern was also seen when comparing Ether with Bitcoin.\n\nIn the 25 days leading up to the approval of a Core EIP, Ether\u2019s price against Bitcoin typically increased by about 12%, showing that Ether\u2019s price does tend to increase significantly in anticipation of major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nSuch increases are particularly significant considering the concentrated governance structure where a small group holds substantial influence over key decisions.\n\nFor example, an average of 10 people per client implementation \u2014 each client being a different version of software that runs the Ethereum protocol \u2014 are responsible for 80% of all software changes.\n\nWhen comparing Ether\u2019s performance with the S&P 500, its price movements didn\u2019t always align with the stock market trends, showing that factors influencing Ether are different from those driving the markets.\n\nFor market participants, from casual investors to institutional traders, these insights may offer some potentially valuable perspectives on how governance-related events can be crucial indicators for investment strategies.\n\nFor the Ethereum community and developers, the data highlights the impact their decisions have, not just on the network\u2019s technical trajectory, but on its financial ecosystem as well.\n\nEther's price performance for the last 30 days.\n\nEther\u2019s price is $2,270, up 3.7% on the day, after falling 16% from its yearly high of $2,700 on January 12.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is about one month away from being finalised, which according to the study, should coincide with an increase in Ether\u2019s price."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Really Bearish In 2024? - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Crypto markets may have been volatile this week, triggered by a breakdown on Bitcoin\u2019s chart and a retracement in Ethereum (not the start of an Ethereum\u2019s crash is what we said). Consequently, the \u2018Ethereum bearish\u2018 message is suddenly found everywhere which is in contrast to the sentiment and messaging two weeks ago.\n\nWhile some \u2018pundits\u2019 may come out to call for the end of Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, similarly the end of Ethereum\u2019s bull market, we have a different view.\n\nPreviously, we outlined why Ethereum could still reach $10,000 by 2025, though will probably reach the $3,000 \u2013 $4,000 region in 2024. We stand by this view.\n\nSome commentators have a different opinion, indicating that Ethereum could be a bearish asset in 2024, though such claims are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe problems with poor quality chart analysis\n\nThe issue with low-quality chart analysis is mainly with the timeframe. In the chart below, there are no structured price patterns and the content is short-term orientated. It\u2019s basically impossible to make a reasoned analysis by looking at a single chart \u2013 especially an intraday one!\n\nYet the fallacies contained within the analysis are not apparent to viewers when reading the content. It\u2019s also possible to take a different view on the same chart and draw an entirely different conclusion. Ideally, a lot of factors will converge to create a powerful signal (bullish or bearish).\n\nPractically all of the content regarding Ethereum on this Trading View blog is erroneous, indicating a drop to $700 for Ethereum. We find that highly unlikely and the charts simply don\u2019t back it up, even amidst a declining overall market.\n\nDespite the majority of false claims, there is some sound analysis. This Ethereum technical prediction outlines that despite a bearish outlook in the near term, Ethereum has a strong potential for a bullish reversal in 2024.\n\nEthereum is not bearish in 2024\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Ethereum is not bearish at all in 2024, and that\u2019s in spite of the Bitcoin retracement which we predicted in this altcoin season article. Our exact words were:\n\nArguably, before alt season 2024 will kick off, it might come with a drop in BTC. In a way, it makes sense that an explosive run starts with a drop. The market loves to mislead bulls, particularly at the start and end of bull markets\n\nWe predict an ETH price rise to $10,000 by 2025, and that\u2019s based on sound chart analysis. Take a look at the daily chart.\n\nThe price to hit for this to occur is $3,525. After this, it would be a 3x to $10k. The weekly price chart indicates a similar price rise for ETH, with a rounded reversal bullish pattern.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the headlines! Ethereum is unlikely to go to $700. And it\u2019s likely to end 2024 at a high, possibly even an all-time high. After all, as we keep repeating, 2024 is a hidden crypto bull market in disguise, with a fake drop to fool investors.\n\nTo truly understand what the market is doing, we have a unique crypto investment newsletter dedicated to finding the best coins at the most optimal entry points. It was the first crypto-focused newsletter of its kind, created back in 2016, and has an impeccable track record for finding winners in any market.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) had depressing week after the historic approval and trading of several crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap plunged hard on Monday following a sell-off from digital asset fund manager Grayscale. The virtual coin dropped below $40,000 (to $38,678) on Tuesday, but slowly recovered as the week went on.\n\nIt is now trading for $41,830, CoinGecko data shows, a less than 1% movement over seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF started trading, it had operated like a closed-end fund where investors could not redeem their shares for BTC. However, following its conversion and subsequent trading, investors started to cash out quickly.\n\nThis led Grayscale to send huge amounts of the cryptocurrency to its custodian, Coinbase, leading to pressure on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off slowed towards the end of the week\u2014likely leading to the rebound in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though: Analysts told Decrypt that Bitcoin \u201ccould see increased appeal\u201d in 2024\u2014if the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut BTC\u2019s plunge in the week hit the wider crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) was a big loser, dropping to $2,186 on Tuesday and never really recovering, logging an 8% loss over the week. It\u2019s now trading for $2,264.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts drop came following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision to delay ETH ETF proposals from both BlackRock and Grayscale.\n\nElsewhere, Solana (SOL) took a beating. It was, at the start of the week, one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies. It has since picked up and is trading for $92.60, a more than 1% seven-day rise.\n\nWhile Dogecoin (DOGE)\u2014the original meme coin and 11th biggest cryptocurrency\u2014pumped at the start of the week over speculation that it might be used for payments on Twitter, it slowly drifted back to where it started. It kicked off the week at $0.08, and is back at the same spot as of writing.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Spot ether ETFs have roughly a 60% chance of being approved in May, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.\n\nEarlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission delayed decisions on the potential BlackRock and Grayscale ether ETFs. Alongside BlackRock and Grayscale, Ark 21Shares and VanEck are also in the running for a spot ether ETF.\n\nThe delays were not surprising, according to experts who expect the SEC to put off a decision on the ETFs until later this year. The SEC, earlier this month, approved a slew of bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRead more: Race for a spot ether ETF begins with bid from Ark Invest, 21Shares\n\nSeyffart is eyeing May 23 as the next date to watch in the spot ether saga. May 23 marks the 240-day window for the SEC to decide on proposals from Ark/21Shares and VanEck.\n\n\u201cMy base case is still probably around 60-ish percent that they\u2019ll approve them\u201d around that date, he told Blockworks. \u201cBut there\u2019s plenty of ways they can delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if the SEC wants to get geared up and ready to go and wants everyone to go at the same time, they\u2019ll likely do it on May 23 unless they can figure out some way to deny or delay this whole process and do what they want,\u201d he continued.\n\nIf a May approval doesn\u2019t pan out, then Seyffart plans to watch 2025.\n\nGrayscale is taking a similar approach to its bitcoin ETF by trying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a radio interview that the firm is looking at summer 2024 for an SEC decision.\n\n\u201cThat clock will come due sometime this summer,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: After spot bitcoin ETF approval, eyes shift to ether fund decision\n\nIts application for a bitcoin ETF was initially denied which led the firm to file an appeal. Back in August, a panel of judges sided with Grayscale, leaving the SEC to reconsider the application.\n\n\u201cThis ruling opened the floodgates for BTC, so to speak. And also put the SEC in a logical pretzel,\u201d Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson said.\n\nFast forward to January, and Grayscale was one of nearly a dozen firms approved to launch. It is also the fund with the highest number of outflows since the ETFs went live earlier this month.\n\nJohnsson further gave his insights on the possible ETH ETF roadmap in a post on X Thursday.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s a lot of \u201cnuance right now,\u201d but he expects that, in the long term, \u201cETH spot is almost guaranteed.\u201d\n\nHowever, the SEC can choose to ask potential issuers to pull their applications or issue denials when the May deadlines come around. If the SEC were to ask Ark/21Shares or VanEck to withdraw then it\u2019s a \u201cgood indication that the SEC is going to approve these,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\n\u201cThe SEC might just need more time to get up to speed with Ethereum versus Bitcoin,\u201d he added, noting how different the two are.\n\nCaution, Johnsson said, \u201cis warranted in assuming spot ETF approval.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nJohnsson believes that the existence of ether futures ETFs is a bright spot for the potential green light, having seen that the SEC approved the bitcoin ETFs partially on that basis.\n\nSeyffart added that the SEC could say that the futures market isn\u2019t \u201clarge enough or liquid enough or impactful enough\u201d when looking at spot ether ETFs.\n\nBut, as May approaches, there should be clues that \u201cinform\u201d the public as to what the SEC is thinking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few different things that we can look to to get a feel for what\u2019s going on that we don\u2019t have yet, and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to have it for some time. Perhaps another month or two,\u201d Seyffart said. These things include filings and responses from both the issuers and the SEC.\n\n\u201cIt would certainly not surprise me if the SEC decided to avoid the [DC Circuit] at all costs and simply issued approval,\u201d Johnsson said in a post on X.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, in an interview earlier this week, said that the SEC \u201cshouldn\u2019t need a court to tell us that our approach is arbitrary and capricious in order for us to get it right.\u201d\n\nShe added that the SEC will \u201capply precedent\u201d to spot ether decisions.\n\nCurrently, Seyffart told Blockworks, the process for spot ETH approval reminds him of July of last year. Around that time, BlackRock and other issuers were about a month into the spot bitcoin ETF race and the Grayscale decision had yet to be issued.\n\n\u201cI know the timeline isn\u2019t exactly lining up that way, but what we know and what we don\u2019t know are kind of in the same boat,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This increase in transactions indicates that there was a large volume exchange of Ether between market participants on exchange platforms.

Source: Santiment\n\nLarge wallet addresses in the Ethereum network have engaged in profit-taking, as seen in the chart below. When the Whale Transaction Count, valued at $100,000 and higher, is combined with Network Realized Profit/Loss, the data reveals that whales are realizing profits.\n\nSantiment data therefore supports the likelihood of a correction in ETH price.\n\nWhale Transaction Count and Network Realized Profit/ Loss. Source: Santiment\n\nEthereum price at risk of decline\n\nEthereum price is in a downward trend that started on January 12. Since then, the altcoin has formed lower highs and lower lows, and broken below a key trendline. Ethereum price is currently below two key Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), the 10-day and 50-day, at $2,325, and $2,308.\n\nIf Ethereum price continues correcting, it is likely to find support at $2,165, a level that has acted as support for the altcoin since December 3. If ETH price fails to hold above this level, the altcoin could nosedive to its psychologically important level of $2,000, as seen in the chart below.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA daily candlestick close above the $2,232 level could invalidate the bearish thesis for Ethereum price."

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts : All You Need To Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum stands as a decentralized blockchain platform driven by the Ether token, offering users a versatile range of capabilities. From facilitating transactions to playing games, engaging in cryptocurrency trading, storing nonfungible tokens (NFTs) earning interest through staking, and even participating in social media activities, the platform presents a comprehensive ecosystem.\n\nMany envision Ethereum as the natural progression of the internet. While centralized platforms like Apple\u2019s App Store embody the era of Web 2.0, Ethereum represents the dawn of Web 3.0\u2014a decentralized, community-driven network. This new phase in internet evolution supports decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It\u2019s crucial to note that Ether, not Ethereum, is the designated crypto unit.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNow, let\u2019s unravel some lesser-known facts that add intriguing dimensions to the Ethereum narrative.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Supply Dynamics\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum takes a different stance on token supply. With over 120 million its tokens circulating, a stark contrast emerges\u2014over ten times more tokens than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by its approaching finite supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum follows a different trajectory, emphasizing abundance over scarcity.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s imminent scarcity pushes its value higher and poses challclassicenges to mining. The philosophy is straightforward: fewer coins available often translate to higher cryptocurrency value. Once a cryptocurrency reaches its maximum supply, mining stops, and market dynamics revolve around supply and demand.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum doesn\u2019t impose a fixed supply cap. Instead, it employs a mechanism called \u201cminimum viable issuance\u201d to manage Ether\u2019s inflation rate, ensuring network security and motivating validators.\n\nThe platform\u2019s issuance rate undergoes adjustments through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and community consensus. Diverging from Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap, it introduces a flexible approach, allowing for ongoing adjustments to maintain balance within the network. Notably, EIP-1559 introduces a deflationary element by burning a portion of ETH as a base fee, contributing to the evolving economic dynamics of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dual Narrative\n\nThe Ethereum community faced a seismic event in 2015\u2014the DAO hack, resulting in a substantial loss of $150 million worth of tokens. To salvage Ethereum from the brink of collapse, a consequential decision was made: a hard fork. However, a faction within the community, guided by the principle of \u201cCode is law,\u201d opted to adhere to the original code. This pivotal moment birthed two chains\u2014the forked chain retaining the name Ethereum, and the original chain christened Ethereum Classic, which continues to follow the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, preserving the ethos of the original code.\n\nThe Genesis: Birth and Philosophy\n\nEthereum\u2019s beginnings trace back to 2013, involving a collective effort by eight individuals, including the visionary Vitalik Buterin, who crafted the coin (ETH) in Switzerland. With its official launch in 2015, Ethereum\u2019s origin story bears the imprint of Buterin\u2019s dissatisfaction with centralized services\u2014a sentiment molded by his experiences in the world of World of Warcraft. This critical perspective formed the philosophical foundation of Ethereum, steering its path toward decentralization.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to avoid confusion between Ethereum and Ether. Ether, the native token, serves as a virtual coin within the Ethereum network, much like other digital currencies. Beyond being a tradable asset, Ether plays various roles\u2014it is used for transactions, runs applications within the Ethereum network, and serves as a means to monetize activities conducted on the platform.\n\nEthereum\u2019s move towards Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn the early days, both Bitcoin and Ethereum relied on a process called \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW), where individuals could mine new tokens by validating blockchain transactions on their personal computers. However, in September 2022, Ethereum (ETH) underwent a significant transformation, moving away from PoW to embrace Proof-of-Stake.\n\nUnder PoS, new coins are created when crypto owners \u201cstake\u201d their own coins, essentially locking them up to participate in transaction verification and, consequently, earn rewards. While this method was already employed by Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), Ether swiftly ascended to become the leading cryptocurrency in terms of staked value.\n\nThe primary motivation behind this shift lies in energy efficiency. The energy consumption associated with Ethereum transactions was staggering, equating to over 100,000 VISA transactions in December 2021. However, post the Ethereum Merge, the energy footprint notably decreased. Observers believe that this change not only influences public perceptions of cryptocurrencies but also holds implications for the future development of popular decentralized finance (DeFi) categories within Ethereum, such as crypto lending.\n\nExploring Alternatives to \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d\n\nEthereum encountered a pivotal moment known as the \u201cSplit,\u201d sparking a quest for alternatives to the traditional \u201cProof-of-Work\u201d (PoW) model. As some enthusiasts applaud the reduction in energy costs, not all its formerminers welcomed the Merge, a transition away from the PoW model.\n\nIn September 2022, a revealing graphic displayed a substantial dump of Ethereum (ETH) by miners holding blockchain addresses linked to their mining activities. Expecting a price surge post-Merge, these miners were disappointed, leading to the selling of their ETH holdings.\n\nThe blockchain witnessed a surge in transaction counts, reaching approximately 1.1 million per day in September 2022. This uptick in activity coincided with the aftermath of the Merge and the subsequent dissatisfaction among miners. The dissatisfaction prompted a significant number of miners to part ways, seeking alternative cryptocurrencies for their mining endeavors.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Crowdfunding\n\nEthereum\u2019s inception traces back to a community-driven initiative, spearheaded by its creator, Vitalik Buterin. In 2013, Buterin conceived the idea of decentralized blockchain platform, inspired by a sense of dissatisfaction with the limitations he observed in Bitcoin. His vision extended beyond the constraints of existing blockchain technology, aiming to create a platform capable of supporting intricate and diverse applications.\n\nIn 2014, he initiated a community-backed fundraising effort, selling the initial batch of Ethereum tokens known as Ether (ETH) to the public. This crowdfunding campaign marked a significant milestone, surpassing expectations and raising over $18 million in just 42 days. Notably, this successful endeavour propelled the blockchain into the ranks of the first and largest crowdfunded projects in history.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey began not only as a technological innovation but as a testament to the power of community support, illustrating how collaborative efforts can pave the way for ground breaking projects in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nBonus: Ethereum\u2019s Growing Influence in Tech Boardrooms\n\nBeyond the realm of developers and investors, Ethereum has captured the attention of major corporations. Giants like Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Intel, and Amazon are exploring itspotential solutions. Enterprise software companies, including IBM and Deloitte, are testing the platform\u2019s networks, signaling a broader acceptance of blockchain technology in corporate landscapes.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of blockchain, Ethereum stands as a pioneer, symbolizing innovation, adaptability, and community-driven progress. Beyond its decentralized framework, the popular platform embodies the essence of Web 3.0, ushering in a new era of user empowerment. From token dynamics to the Proof-of-Stake transition and corporate intrigue, Ethereum\u2019s journey reflects a dynamic intersection of technological evolution and philosophical principles. As it charts the course for decentralized possibilities, it serves as a testament to collective spirit in advancing blockchain technology."

        "content": "History was made on Saturday when the first ever loan against a domain name was executed with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The significance is that the success marks the birth of a new asset class that can be leveraged to unlock capital for business owners or domain name investors in an expeditious and secure manner.\n\ndeBanked founder Sean Murray was the executor of the transaction. The process involved tokenizing a domain name (domainfi.net) into an NFT and then offering that NFT as collateral on an NFT loan marketplace. When a loan was executed on the platform with a smart contract, the domain name was automatically placed into an ethereum address to be held as escrow. If the borrower were to default on the loan, the smart contract would automatically release the domain name to the lender, who would now have full control of it.\n\nThe process involved two parties, the tokenizing registrar and the NFT loan marketplace. The loan, which was consummated for proof of concept, carried a 10% APY and a 7-day term. It took less than 20 minutes combined to complete the tokenization and loan execution process.\n\n\u201cI was guessing that this capability might still be another year away and I had not even dreamed that I would be the very first one to execute this type of loan,\u201d said Murray. \u201cFollowing this space closely probably contributed to that stroke of luck. There is still time until this is ready to be a consumer-facing product in the marketplace, but the tech already exists and transactions of this nature are already viable. It will be fascinating to watch.\u201d\n\nAbout deBanked\n\ndeBanked was launched in 2010.

        "content": "FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevicha projects Ethereum\u2019s price could further dip towards $2,000, as the altcoin is down by over 8% weekly.\n\nThe crypto market is experiencing a period of subdued volatility, with the total market capitalization hovering around $1.6 trillion for the third consecutive day. Simultaneously, equity indices in the stock market have also significantly declined in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the impact on cryptocurrency investors has been minimal. Kuptsikevich thinks that the fall in stock values is seen more as a result of individual corporate stories rather than an indication of a global shift in market sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation phase, with its market share exceeding 50% once again. On the other hand, Ethereum has found itself at the lower end of the consolidation range, which it has been in for most of December. Kuptsikevich predicts that Ethereum is showing signs of possibly dropping to the $2,100 area, a level that marked the upper end of its November consolidation phase.\n\nETH 7-day market performance | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: OKX shuts down mining pools after five years of operation\n\nKuptsikevich suggests that a further decline towards the $2,000 mark is possible, citing the cryptocurrency market\u2019s inherent volatility. This potential dip could mirror a similar retracement in Bitcoin to the $37,500 level.\n\nThe SEC has also delayed its decision on BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Ethereum ETF until March 10. While some experts remain optimistic about the ETF\u2019s approval by May, with a probability of 50-to-70%, others are wary of regulatory resistance.\n\nThe introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has broadened the appeal of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. According to the head of institutional at Coinbase, this marks a potential shift towards mainstream adoption of digital currencies.\n\nHowever, the influx of new capital into new cryptocurrencies is expected to be a gradual process, unfolding over months or even years."

This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.\n\nFurther complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana is leading pack\n\nSolana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.\n\nAt the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.\n\nResistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.\n\nThe relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.\n\nEthereum needs push\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.\n\nAt present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.\n\nResistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.\n\nThe selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.\n\nOn the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary \"fuel,\" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Shapella hard fork was a controversial upgrade that ignited fears of selling pressure. But the latest data tells a different story.\n\nIn January 2024, Intotheblock\u2019s data revealed the highest Ethereum staking rate, reaching approximately 30 million ETH staked, accompanied by a staking participation rate of over 24%. This milestone suggested a preference for staking over promptly selling off tokens.\n\nEthereum locked-in staking keeps surging, while only 11% of the token supply is currently stored on centralized exchanges.\n\nAnalyzing the latest figures, it\u2019s evident that the much-talked-about Ethereum upgrade, Shapella \u2013 enabling stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 \u2013 did not lead to the widespread unstaking as initially predicted.\n\nEven with the introduction of the new feature enabling stakers to retrieve their tokens, the current staked amount stands at 29.13 million ETH, accounting for 24.2% of the total supply.\n\nAccording to @intotheblock January 2024 witnessed the highest eth staking rate with about 29,128,513.51 ETH staked and a staking participation rate of 24.29%.https://t.co/9ZAwSxhUZm pic.twitter.com/7327HLpUcH \u2014 champagne mami \ud83d\udc95 (@EkponoAkwaowo) January 24, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum staking rate is a metric composed of two components \u2013 rewards for consensus layer duties and priority transaction fees.\n\nThe rewards are guided by Ethereum\u2019s transparent \u201cmonetary policy,\u201d adapting based on the total staked ETH, prioritizing security. The transaction fees, on the other hand, are influenced by the demand on the Ethereum network, typically rising when new information or opportunities emerge.\n\nAs such, expanding the user base and use cases for Ethereum\u2019s staking rate is crucial for enhancing network security, attracting new investments in ether, and establishing connections between digital assets and traditional finance."

        "content": "Ethereum Scaling Solution AltLayer Launches With $100 Million Airdrop\n\nAltLayer recently became the first of at least three protocols to go live with an impressive $100 million token airdrops scheduled for the upcoming week. The launch marks a milestone in the field of blockchain technology, offering promising solutions for Ethereum's scalability issues.\n\nThe much-anticipated ALT token and the claiming process were officially made available to the public as of Jan. 25, 9 am UTC, as per Cointelegraph. A staggering 300 million tokens were allocated for the initial airdrop, resulting in a total value of approximately $96 million based on the current average daily price of $0.32 per token.\n\nHowever, Celestia stakers eager to participate in the ALT airdrop will have to exercise patience as AltLayer reported technical differences delaying the distribution to Celestia. Despite this delay, AltLayer's airdrop comes at a time when several other projects are also expected to distribute their respective tokens to eligible recipients within the same timeframe.\n\nDymension and Jupiter to Follow Suit\n\nAccording to ADVFN, among these projects is Dymension, a multilayer rollup deployer poised to launch its mainnet in the near future. Dymension plans to airdrop 70 million DYM tokens, primarily benefiting Celestia stakers and Pudgy Penguin NFT holders, as well as participants in the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.\n\nFurthermore, the Solana-based decentralized exchange Jupiter has confirmed the launch of its highly anticipated JUP token on Jan. 31. A total of 1 billion tokens will be distributed through the airdrop, making it potentially worth around $410 million based on the current pre-market trading price of approximately $0.41 per token.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Users Could Benefit from Airdrop\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Ordinals users may also have an opportunity to participate in an airdrop. Ordinals developer Leonidas recently announced the launch of \"Runestone,\" a decentralized \"fairdrop\" initiative designed to reward early users of the Ordinals protocol. The airdrop aims to incentivize users' early adoption and engagement.\n\nWhile airdrops offer exciting possibilities, crypto users must exercise caution. The X platform is currently plagued by scam accounts posing as crypto firms' official social media pages announcing airdrops. Users must remain vigilant to avoid falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.\n\nPhoto: Traxer/Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

The bankrupt lender\u2019s most recent withdrawal frenzy saw it transfer 459,561 ETH to three exchanges.\n\nSpecifically, these transactions occurred within the last 24 hours, wielding a market value of $1,030,501,203, considering an average price of $2,242 for Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBreakdown of Celsius ETH Transfers\n\nOn-chain data indicates that the largest chunk of the transferred ETH went to Coinbase\u2019s institutional platform, Coinbase Prime. In particular, the platform took a store of 305,254 ETH tokens from Celsius, valued at over $674 million.\n\nSimilarly, Celsius transferred nearly 150k Ethereum worth $324 million to Paxos, a blockchain firm. Other recent dealings include $17 million in ETH moved to the crypto brokerage and trading platform FalconX.\n\nThis is not the first time Celsius is moving assets to crypto exchanges. Three days ago, Spot On Chain disclosed that Celsius redirected $36 million to Coinbase and FalconX.\n\nFurthermore, the on-chain tracker observed that Celsius\u2019 withdrawal frenzy first peaked in November 2023 amid a cashout of $621 million Ethereum.\n\nThe recent $1.03 billion transfer brings the total amount moved by the embattled crypto lender to over $1.69 billion worth of ETH within the last three months. As of now, Celsius still retains 62,469 ETH worth $140 million in the address under scrutiny.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCommunity Reacts\n\nCrypto market participants have voiced apprehension about the potential implication of the persistent ETH transactions with exchanges.\n\nFor instance, X influencer MartyParty raised concern that Celsius might disrupt the gradual recovery in the ETH market as the past few weeks have been bloodbaths.\n\nAt press time, ETH sells for $ $2,242, marking a decline of over 10% since last week.

        "content": "Market picture\n\nVolatility in the cryptocurrency market remains subdued, keeping the capitalisation near $1.56 trillion for the third day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains around $40K, and Ethereum looks pegged to $2200.\n\nThe drop in equity indices over the past 24 hours hasn\u2019t been too much of a concern for cryptocurrency investors so far, as it looks more like a series of individual corporate stories rather than a global shift in sentiment.\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from this consolidation as its share of all cryptocurrencies has once again surpassed 50%.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum, the second most-capitalised coin, has returned to the lower end of the consolidation it spent most of December in, losing since the start of the day and threatening to fall a notch lower to the $2100 area, which was the upper end of the consolidation in November. A decline here would be as logical a move as a BTCUSD pullback to $37500, which remains the main scenario. At the same time, however, be prepared for a brief dip towards $2000 due to cryptocurrency volatility.\n\nNews background\n\nThe SEC postponed the decision on BlackRock\u2019s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF until 10 March. Optimistic experts expect the Ethereum ETF to be approved in May with a 50-70% probability, while sceptics point to regulatory resistance.\n\nThe emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has opened the door for the cryptocurrency to reach a wider audience. Now, for the first time, cryptocurrency could become mainstream, said the head of institutional at exchange Coinbase. New cryptocurrencies will attract a lot of capital, but it won\u2019t happen overnight. It will take \u201cmonths and even years\u201d.\n\nThe G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board in 2024 plans to focus on global regulations for the digital asset industry and the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\nReuters confirmed the existence of a thriving underground crypto market in China. Investor interest in digital assets is growing against the backdrop of a troubled economy and a lack of value preservation tools. With Hong Kong\u2019s approval of digital assets in 2023, Hong Kong has become one of the opportunities for Chinese investors to access cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "On chain sleuth ties Ethereum Foundation to 2016 GateCoin Hack as US SEC delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF - Tekedia",
        "content": "A new investigation by an on-chain sleuth has revealed that the Ethereum Foundation may have been involved in the 2016 Gate Coin Hack, which resulted in the theft of more than 185,000 ETH and 250 BTC from the Hong Kong-based exchange.\n\nThe on-chain sleuth, who goes by the pseudonym of Boringsleuth, published a detailed report on X, where he traced the origin and destination of the stolen funds using blockchain analysis tools. He claims that he found evidence that some of the hacked ETH was sent to an address controlled by the Ethereum Foundation, and that the Foundation later sold some of the tainted coins on Kraken.\n\nThe Gatecoin Hack occurred between May 9th and May 12th, 2016, prior to at the onset of The DAO\u2019s token sale & 1 Month Prior to The Dao Hack. Per Gatecoin\u2019s official statement on May 14th, the hack resulted in losses of 185K Ethereum, valued at more than $460M today. At the time, Gatecoin \u201cclaimed\u201d that the hacker was able to alter their own system to bypass their multi-sig cold storage, so that all inbound Deposits into Gatecoin went straight to their exploitable Hot Wallet.\n\nThey list the 4 Hacker Eth address\u2019 below involved in the Exploit, Among the 4 ETH address\u2019, one address, 0x1342a0, was originally funded PRIOR to the exploit. Our focus in this thread is looking into who it was that funded this Hacker\u2019s wallet, in hopes of gaining an idea of who it was that was behind the Hack.\n\nBoringsleuth\u2019s report is based on the assumption that the hacker used a smart contract to split the stolen funds into smaller amounts and send them to different addresses. He says that he identified the hacker\u2019s contract by looking for transactions that had a high gas price and a low value, which indicated that they were used to deploy a contract.\n\nHe then analyzed the contract\u2019s code and found that it had a function called split Funds , which took an array of addresses and amounts as inputs and sent ETH to each address accordingly.\n\nBoringsleuth says that he tracked down all the addresses that received ETH from the hacker\u2019s contract and found that one of them belonged to the Ethereum Foundation. He says that he verified this by comparing the address with the list of addresses that received ETH from the genesis block, which are known to be controlled by the Foundation.\n\nHe also says that he checked the balance history of the address and found that it received 2,000 ETH from the hacker\u2019s contract on March 15, 2016, which was one day after the Gate Coin Hack.\n\nBoringsleuth claims that he further followed the trail of the stolen ETH and found that some of it was sold on Kraken between April and June 2016. He says that he identified the Kraken deposit address of the Foundation by looking for transactions that had a high value and a low gas price, which indicated that they were used to transfer ETH to an exchange.\n\nHe then cross-referenced the address with Kraken\u2019s API and found that it matched with one of the Foundation\u2019s accounts. He also says that he checked the trading history of the account and found that it sold 1,337 ETH for BTC between April 4 and June 13, 2016.\n\nBoringsleuth concludes his report by saying that he has contacted both Gate Coin and the Ethereum Foundation to inform them of his findings but has not received any response from either party. He says that he hopes that his investigation will shed some light on one of the biggest unsolved hacks in crypto history, and that he will continue to monitor the movement of the remaining stolen funds.\n\nUS SEC delays BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nMeanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF, a fund that would track the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The SEC said it needed more time to evaluate the proposal, which was filed by BlackRock in October 2023. The new deadline for the SEC\u2019s decision is March 29, 2024.\n\nBlackRock is one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, with over $9 trillion in assets under management. The company has been exploring the crypto space for a while, and already offers exposure to Bitcoin futures through some of its funds. However, the Spot Ethereum ETF would be the first of its kind to directly invest in the underlying asset, rather than derivatives.\n\nThe SEC has been cautious about approving crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation, volatility, custody, and investor protection. So far, the regulator has only approved Bitcoin futures ETFs, which trade on regulated exchanges and are subject to margin requirements and clearinghouse oversight. Spot ETFs, on the other hand, would hold the actual cryptocurrencies in custody, and would require the SEC to grant exemptions from some of its rules.\n\nThe crypto community has been eagerly awaiting the approval of spot ETFs, as they would provide a more convenient and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to the nascent asset class. Spot ETFs would also potentially boost the liquidity and price discovery of the underlying cryptocurrencies, as well as attract more institutional investors to the space.\n\nHowever, the SEC\u2019s delay is not surprising, given its history of postponing or rejecting crypto ETF proposals. The regulator has repeatedly asked for more information and feedback from the public and the industry on various aspects of crypto ETFs, such as valuation, liquidity, arbitrage, market surveillance, and investor education. The SEC has also indicated that it prefers a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets before approving spot ETFs.\n\nBlackRock is not the only company that is seeking to launch a spot Ethereum ETF in the US. Other firms, such as VanEck, WisdomTree, and Bitwise, have also filed similar proposals with the SEC, but have not received any response yet. Meanwhile, Canada has already approved several spot crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum ones, which have attracted significant inflows and trading volumes.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC will finally greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF in 2024, or whether it will continue to delay or deny such products. The crypto industry is hopeful that the regulator will eventually recognize the benefits and potential of spot ETFs and will align its stance with other jurisdictions that have already embraced them.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "title": "REPORT | Crypto Owners Globally Grew By Over 34% to 580 Million in 2023 Despite Macro Headwinds - bitcoinke.io",
        "content": "The worldwide community of cryptocurrency owners increased by 34%, advancing from 432 million to 580 million throughout 2023, a new report says.\n\nAccording to the report by Crypto.com, Bitcoin and Ethereum played pivotal roles in driving adoption growth in 2023.\n\nThe number of Bitcoin owners surged by 33%, escalating from 222 million in January 2023 to 296 million in December 2023.\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum witnessed a 39% increase in ownership, rising from 89 million to 124 million over the same timeframe.\n\nThe report says:\n\n\u201cCrypto adoption in 2023 achieved new milestones, with the number of cryptocurrency owners reaching 580 million (December 2023) in spite of macro headwinds, namely the further monetary tightening by Western central banks to try to tame inflation, protracted kinetic conflict in Europe and a new one in the Middle East, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge in April and May 2023 can be attributed to the momentum gained by Bitcoin Ordinals, a platform facilitating the creation of NFTs on the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin Ordinals have witnessed over 54 million inscriptions embedded in the Bitcoin network, and the cumulative inscription fees have surpassed 5,473 BTC (equivalent to $257 million) as of the current date.\n\nIn addition to the rise of BRC-20 tokens, the growth of BTC in Q4 2023 was influenced by heightened interest from institutional investors. This surge was propelled by the advancement of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), further contributing to the notable expansion of Bitcoin during that period.\n\n\u201cApril and May saw exceptionally strong monthly growth rates of 5.1% and 6.7%, respectively. This coincided with Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade on 12 April 2023,\u201d the report says.\n\nLiquid staking remained a prominent trend for Ethereum, particularly gaining traction following Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade. The growth in Ethereum adoption closely paralleled the changes observed in staked ETH, indicating a correlation between the two phenomena.\n\n\u201cWhen analysing the composition of cryptocurrency owners, we found that the shares of both BTC and ETH were flat due to the growth of the denominator (the total number of cryptocurrency owners). ETH\u2019s adoption rate increased 0.7%, while Bitcoin dropped 0.4% during the year.\u201d\n\nThe analysis is based on a combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum on-chain data, survey analysis, and Crypto.com\u2019s own internal data.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

        "title": "Experts turn their attention to Spot Ethereum ETF: Will Ethereum Classic and NuggetRush benefit again? - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "TLDR:\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF is now the strongest narrative in the crypto community.\n\nEthereum Classic is one of the top altcoins looking to rally off a potential approval.\n\nFollowing its 80% increase, NuggetRush could jump 25x after a spot ETF approval.\n\nAlthough the ETF impact on crypto prices has predominantly been negative in the first two weeks, the crypto market has turned its attention to a spot Ethereum ETF. According to recent reports, there are seven ETFs for Ethereum waiting to be approved.\n\nIn other news, Ethereum Classic (ETC) benefited from the last ETH rally and will be looking to extend its gains. Meanwhile, NuggetRush has already yielded gains of more than 80% as investors show support for its impact gaming model.\n\nA Spot Ethereum (ETF) is closer than first expected\n\nMany analysts predicted that it would take a while for Ethereum to get its own spot ETF after the SEC decision on Bitcoin ETF was announced on January 11. However, it is now certain that an ETH spot ETF will be approved soon.\n\nAccording to a recent report, there are seven filings for a spot Ethereum ETF waiting for approval. These applications are from VanEck, Ark Invest, Fidelity, iShares, Grayscale, Invesco, and Hasdex. The SEC has issued deadlines between May and August for these products.\n\nThe Kaiko Research team has reported that approval is the biggest narrative in the crypto space. This is because, unlike Bitcoin, a market rally is expected for Ethereum. Many experts expect the price of ETH to surpass $5,000 before the year ends.\n\nNuggetRush (NUGX) forms pattern for parabolic rise in 2024\n\nDuring the recent bear market, NuggetRush (NUGX) is one of the best altcoins that remained bullish. In the last few weeks, its price has increased by 80% as NUGX set a new high at $0.018. The massive support for the impact gaming model of NuggetRush has fueled this rally and helped set the ground for a major NUGX rally in 2024.\n\nNuggetRush has created a very cool game that offers a unique play-to-earn (P2E) experience. In this game, players can win gold and NFT rewards by participating in mining challenges. There are multiple landscapes covered in resources like gold that players can mine and earn rewards for themselves.\n\nThe game is designed to be challenging, with players competing against each other to build the largest mining operation. However, NuggetRush stands out as one of the top DeFi projects in its social impact.\n\nAs players earn, a portion of the rewards are sent to artisanal miners in underdeveloped regions. This unique gaming model has set NuggetRush apart from the competition. This is why market experts believe its ERC20 coin, NUGX, could soar by 50x in 2024.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) set to benefit from a SEC approval\n\nWhen the crypto market was bullish in anticipation of Bitcoin ETF approval, Ethereum Classic (ETC) was one of the biggest gainers. Outperforming ETH, the price of Ethereum Classic jumped by more than 50% to set a 2024 high at $32.00.\n\nAlthough the price of ETC has retraced along with the crypto market, there are still high expectations for Ethereum Classic. Many experts have bullish predictions for ETC because it has become a refuge for PoW miners seeking Ethereum features.\n\nThe network also performed a major upgrade to help Ethereum Classic maintain protocol parity with Ethereum. According to Finbold, Ethereum Classic could rally from $23.00 to $100.00 in 2024, making it one of the best altcoins to buy.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF has become a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community, and for good reason. With approval, we could see a potential rally for ETC while NuggetRush continues to dominate the GameFi sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe presale stage is often the best time to invest in new crypto projects before hype drives up the price. Right now, investors are researching Kelexo (KLXO) presale as supporters shift funds from major assets.\n\nEnthusiasts of Kelexo (KLXO) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nPotential supporters are watching KLXO\n\nKelexo (KLXO) is revolutionizing the peer-to-peer lending space by eliminating intermediaries and bureaucratic processes. Users can instantly lend or borrow funds in crypto with just a simple setup and without extensive KYC checks or long wait times.\n\nThis straightforward, decentralized model powered by blockchain technology provides significant advantages over traditional lending methods. Borrowers and lenders can connect directly, which removes the expensive overhead costs of intermediaries. Transactions in this marketplace close in seconds instead of days like at banks. Also, there are no minimum loan amounts or durations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy removing these pain points, Kelexo (KLXO) offers users a more efficient way to access lending markets. The minimal identification requirements also enable participation from a wider audience, including those with limited credit history who may not qualify through conventional channels.\n\nKelexo (KLXO) also incentivizes user participation and decentralized governance through its Kelexo (KLXO) token. Token holders can submit platform enhancement proposals and vote on key decisions. An inbuilt rewards program further drives engagement.\n\nWith cutting-edge cryptography guaranteeing security, minimal barriers to access and community ownership, Kelexo (KLXO) represents the future of decentralized finance.

Significant volume has shifted on-chain from blue chip cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Binance coin (BNB) into Kelexo (KLXO) as presale snipers load up their bags.\n\nThese big players help drive momentum and they\u2019re likely expecting Kelexo (KLXO) to follow previous altcoins that did 100x or more out of the gate after presale.\n\nWith only 57% of the total supply available during the presale, scarcity of Kelexo (KLXO) tokens could drive fear of missing out (FOMO), which could lead to price surges post-listing.\n\nConsidering its strong real-world utility and advantage over existing lending platforms, Kelexo (KLXO) checks all the boxes for a breakout success story.\n\nMany believe getting in during presale could be like investing in Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL) during their early days in terms of upside potential.\n\nAnalysts advise not to miss out on this presale as it could be an opportunity to invest in the top 100 coins of the bull market, an opportunity that is quickly disappearing the longer you delay.\n\nAs most experienced market movers know, investing in solid projects early is where huge gains are often made."

        "content": "Luno is announcing that it will now offer customers in Malaysia the ability to stake their cryptocurrency. Specifically, the crypto exchange is allowing folks to stake Ethereum (ETH).\n\nMalaysia the second country for Luno to offer staking, right after South Africa. \u201cWe have always focused on making it safe and simple to buy, sell and store crypto. As a trusted crypto guide, we have made it as easy as tapping a button on the Luno app to open a staking wallet. There is a minimum deposit of 0.00001 ETH or RM1. This will appeal to those who are keeping their ETH for the long term,\u201d Scarlett Chai, Country Manager for Luno, says.\n\nFor those that are unfamiliar with the crypto parlance, Staking refers to the act of\u2026well, staking your cryptocurrency \u2013 in this case, ETH \u2013 to a particular project that uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The function basically came into prominence after The Merge, a move where Ethereum completed its transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) status to proof-of-stake (PoS). To put it in another way: now, instead of having to mine the coin like most cryptominers used to do, you depend on individuals and validators who can also put up their own ETH as collateral.\n\nLuno says that it will offer an annual reward percentage of up to 4% per annum on staked ETH, subject to the network\u2019s demand and the number of active validators. It also says that rewards are given every week and that it will not charge a fee to Staking or unstaking your cryptocurrency. However, there is a staking service fee that is deducted from the reward customers receive.\n\n(Source: Luno)\n\nWhat\u2019s your Reaction? +1 9 +1 0 +1 6 +1 3 +1 0 +1 4"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) performance against Bitcoin (BTC) is a leading indicator of market cycles and an altseason. Thus, cryptocurrency traders and investors constantly monitor the ETH/BTC pair for valuable insights.\n\nIn particular, the well-known CrediBULL Crypto has his eyes turned to this pair and warns of a possible Ethereum sell-off. According to him, Ethereum has found a local top against Bitcoin in an expected deviation above previous highs.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto posted this analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on January 25, quoting a previous post where he forecasted the deviation, as happened.\n\nBoom. Beautiful rejection on ETH/BTC as expected. May revisit those local highs but imo a full retrace of ETH/BTC is on the horizon as $BTC recovers from this recent correction and begins it's next impulsive move to the upside, outperforming ETH once again.\n\n\n\nAs I have said before\u2026 https://t.co/HllnRI4Pee pic.twitter.com/uiOqcVvRBO \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 25, 2024\n\nETH/BTC analysis\n\nNotably, the trader points to a breakout from the current support line at 0.04905 BTC per Ethereum. Furthermore, ETH/BTC should continue its downfall through 0.04624 BTC straight to a range below 0.03800 BTC.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart. Source: CrediBULL Crypto\n\nCrediBULL Crypto explained ETH/BTC will only find a bottom once Bitcoin makes a new all-time high. Therefore, investors must be aware of \u201cany bounces before that,\u201d as they will most likely fade away, in his words.\n\nSince posting, Bitcoin has already outperformed Ethereum by around 2%, validating the above analysis. However, the economic context is a key factor to consider. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and everything could change swiftly.\n\nOn the other hand, institutional investors are turning to Ethereum and showing support for altcoins and tokenization. Recently, Franklin Templeton backed ETH, SOL, and other cryptocurrencies focused on utility. In the meantime, BlackRock\u2019s CEO shared his vision of tokenization while talking about an expected Ethereum spot ETF approval.\n\nAll things considered, it is possible that the ETH/BTC pair surprise technical analysts in the near future, depending on further developments involving institutions and the regulatory landscape. Investors must trade cautiously, keeping themselves updated on the adoption and demand for Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
