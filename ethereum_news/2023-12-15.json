        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has had a great 2023, so has Ethereum (ETH), the second-most traded and recognizable crypto coin in the world. Ethereum is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform and has risen 89.4% in value as of date in 2023.\n\nThe crypto behemoth has paved its path to winning over new customers by making a significant update this year, known as the Shanghai Upgrade. Under this upgrade, ETH shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively short history of cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders, who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system. In essence, proof-of-stake allows holders of Ether to lock up their funds as collateral to validate transactions and create new blocks, reducing the need for extensive computation and energy consumption.\n\nPowered by this development and what promises to be a significant 2024 for cryptocurrency, analysts around the world have turned bullish on it. There is a consensus that ETH might outperform BTC in 2024 with regard to growth rate and will gain more market share based on its proposals to reduce transaction costs and boost the number of transactions per second. In fact, its planned upgrade, called EIP-4844, might ensure that transaction costs could fall to as low as $0.01.\n\nPer Bitwise Asset Management, the world's largest crypto index fund manager, ETH revenues could double from 2023, up to $5 billion in 2024. Also, a state of fast-rising interest rates has not proven conducive to the crypto market. However, with markets widely betting on rate hikes having come to an end and the first rate cut as early as first-quarter 2024, the crisis for crypto may have been averted.\n\nEthereum has already started to make good of the state of the market, and it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source, decentralized blockchain platform. Here is a selection of two stocks that we believe should be tracked. These currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAccenture plc ACN: This global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.6%.

        "content": "The new token standard allows anonymous credentials to ensure only eligible users can access tokens.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Ethereum community has approved the ERC-3643 standard. This standard is the first-ever designed specifically for compliant tokenization. This new standard improves upon the widely used ERC-20 standard, particularly in securities activities. It enhances ERC-20 tokens with controlled advanced functions and compliance modules.\n\nJoachim Lebrum, Chair of the Technology Working Group ERC-3643 Association, stated that:\n\n\u201cThe ERC3643 standard is a groundbreaking step towards integrating advanced blockchain solutions into the enterprise sector, and this validation sends echoes across the ecosystem that ERC3643 is the superior standard for such use cases.\u201d\n\nERC-3643 is a permissioned token standard for tokenizing securities, real-world assets (RWAs), payment systems, and loyalty programs. The standard uses a self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework to verify users\u2019 token eligibility dynamically. This feature ensures compliance through anonymous but verifiable credentials.\n\nThe new ERC-3643 standard sets out to revolutionize how companies leverage blockchain technology. It provides them with a secure, compliant framework to tokenize various assets. Ethereum\u2019s official recognition of this standard demonstrates its goals to address users\u2019 diverse needs. It also establishes a benchmark for institutions implementing this framework in tokenization projects.\n\nCompanies now have an approved standard to actively deploy to bring real-world assets onto blockchains while integrating the necessary compliance controls and permissions.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, experts predict the momentum behind asset tokenization will accelerate. HSBC\u2019s research group forecasts the market for tokenized assets will swell to trillions of dollars by 2030. Governments and significant investment funds are demonstrating growing interest in this area. The next wave of tokenization will likely see bonds, equities, and other mainstream financial assets transitioning to blockchain-based models."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has achieved decentralized governance, according to a message from the project\u2019s creator on Dec. 14.\n\nENS is a naming system for the Ethereum blockchain that adds human-readable names to various resources, including crypto wallets and websites. Until now, the project\u2019s root node was managed by members of the Ethereum community.\n\nNick Johnson, ENS founder, endorsed the change in ownership. He wrote on X:\n\n\u201c[This is] truly the end of an era. Here\u2019s the message I just sent to the ENS root keyholders, requesting the transfer of the last of their powers to the DAO.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s attached email stated that the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of ENS, which is a governance group formed and controlled by ENS token holders, voted unanimously to acquire control of the project\u2019s root node.\n\nHe said that, in response to those voting results, he created a transaction to execute two actions that transfer root control to the DAO address (wallet.ensdao.eth). He wrote that this transaction transfers all remaining multisig responsibilities to the DAO, thereby \u201cretiring the multisig entirely.\u201d It is unclear whether the other multisig owners have approved the transaction.\n\nIndividuals who previously managed ENS\u2019 multisig include Chainlink\u2019s Sergey Nazarov, Metamask\u2019s Dan Finlay, MyCrypto\u2019s Taylor Monahan, Colony\u2019s Aron Fischer, the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Jason Carver and Martin Swende, and Johnson himself. Johnson addressed those individuals in his message, writing: \u201cThank you so much \u2026 for your service to ENS over the years.\u201d\n\nENS governance will be more open\n\nENS\u2019 DAO is a governance group comprising token holders that vote on decisions and issues related to the project by staking tokens.\n\nAccording to the latest proposal, the DAO already has several ownership responsibilities but did not have control over the core ENS root name until now.\n\nThe DAO will gain specific capabilities by controlling the ENS root. The ownership change will allow the DAO to create, manage, and permanently lock top-level domains apart from the permanent and unchangeable .eth domain. It will also allow the DAO to update reverse resolutions that map addresses back to a name. The DAO may also introduce primary domain names on layer-2 networks.\n\nA snapshot indicates that voting concluded on Dec. 15, 2023. Virtually 100% of the staked tokens, or 1.9 million ENS, were staked in favor of DAO ownership. Johnson was one of the largest voters, staking 155,000 ENS in favor. Less than 17 ENS tokens were staked against the plan or were used to abstain.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin has undertaken a large-scale transaction involving trillions of meme tokens, leaving the broader cryptocurrency space curious about the motives behind the founder\u2019s decision.\n\nEthereum Founder Executes Massive Memecoin Sales\n\nEthereum inventor and founder, Vitalik Buterin has made new headlines as reports surface of his substantial memecoin sales. According to blockchain security company, PeckShield Alerts, a Vitalik labeled wallet address was seen swapping 100,000,000,000,111.111 DOBE tokens worth approximately $22,900 for 10.44 Ethereum tokens (ETH). Additionally, the wallet also initiated another sale of 1,858,140,000,000 DOJO tokens worth $6800 for 3.12 ETH.\n\nThe motivation behind the sell-offs remains unknown however the large-scale memecoin transaction has adequately caught the attention of cryptocurrency investors and the market as a whole.\n\nThe substantial meme coin sale follows a recent loss experienced by Buterin earlier this week. The Ethereum founder\u2019s publicly known crypto wallets became short of $29 million between December 15 and 21.\n\nThe loss was reported by blockchain analytics service, Arkham Intelligence. According to the analytics platform, the reason for the loss was due to crypto market fluctuations which saw Buterin\u2019s wallets losing 5% of the total value of its assets.\n\nETH price chart at $2,300 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nButerin Crypto Sell-Offs\n\nIn addition to Buterin\u2019s recent large-scale meme coin sell-off, there have been many other crypto sales executed by the ETH founder. Earlier this year, Buterin sold about 9.9 billion CULT tokens worth $332,420 at the time of the sales. The Ethereum founder subsequently revealed reasons for the sell-off, stating that the cryptocurrency held no cultural or moral value.\n\nLater in October, rumors surfaced about Buterin allegedly selling off his ETH holdings after the Ethereum founder sold about 500,000 USDC worth approximately $14.93 million at the time, to the Gemini exchange. Buterin clarified the sell-off allegations stating that the transactions were made to charitable organizations and other initiatives.\n\nMore times than not, large-scale crypto transactions from prominent leaders in the crypto space tend to capture the attention of investors as these sales could lead to a shift in the market. However, Buterin has also revealed that he has never sold Ethereum tokens (ETH) for his gain since 2018.\n\nThe Ethereum founder is known for making multiple ETH donations to charity organizations and COVID-related causes. Buterin is also known for purchasing and constantly dumping meme coins, causing the value of these tokens to plummet in several cases.\n\nFeatured image from Newsway, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "In the ongoing debate of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, renowned market trader Peter Brandt has expressed significant doubts about Ethereum\u2019s future, contrasting sharply with other market experts. Brandt, known for his blunt analysis, questioned Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability, particularly in comparison to Bitcoin.\n\nPeter Brandt Predicts Dim Future for Ethereum\n\nBrandt, a respected figure in market trading circles, has openly criticized Ethereum, challenging the popular notion that it might soon outpace Bitcoin. He raised a fundamental question regarding investors\u2019 preference for Ethereum over Bitcoin, which he sees as a superior store of value. His comments come amidst bullish forecasts from other market experts and institutions, including JPMorgan. These predictions often highlight Ethereum\u2019s potential growth, especially with its upcoming EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as Protodanksharding.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, Brandt\u2019s skepticism about Ethereum is rooted in its structural and functional aspects. He specifically pointed out the high transaction fees, or \u2018gas fees,\u2019 associated with Ethereum, labelling the digital currency as inefficient. These fees, in his view, severely detract from Ethereum\u2019s value as an investment asset. Furthermore, he controversially suggested that Ethereum might lose its relevance entirely within the next decade.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Fate Tied to Key Price Level\n\nBrandt\u2019s stance starkly contrasts with other leading analysts like Raoul Pal, who have a more favorable outlook on Ethereum. Despite differing opinions, Brandt acknowledged his respect for these analysts but did not waver from his critical perspective.\n\nIn his analysis, Brandt emphasized the importance of the ETH/BTC price chart. He pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s future could hinge on its performance relative to Bitcoin, specifically if it manages to maintain above the 0.04803 level. Should this level hold, Brandt conceded that the \u201cimminent funeral\u201d for Ethereum could be postponed, albeit temporarily.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Brandt has expressed skepticism about Ethereum. In previous statements, he has questioned its decentralization and even referred to it as a \u201cpiece of crap\u201d cryptocurrency. His consistent critique of Ethereum has been a topic of discussion in trading circles, influencing perceptions among investors.\n\nRead Also: Ethereum Price Prediction As Bull Trap Puts $ETH At Risk of 12% Drop\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Fri 15 Dec 2023 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, explores the nuances of Layer-2 solutions in a visionary article. He particularly emphasizes the current dependency of L2 solutions on the main EVM. He also discusses the possibility of directly integrating native ZK-EVM on Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 (L1). The details!\n\nVitalik published an article discussing the current L2 EVM solution heavily relies on the mainnet EVM, and whether it would be possible in the future for the built-in ZK-EVM on L1 to be directly used by Rollups. He also described several possible implementation versions, explored\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 13, 2023 Vitalik Buterin explores new approaches to boost the performance of the Ethereum blockchain\n\nVitalik wants to redefine Ethereum L2 with ZK-EVM\n\nAbout a month ago, we discussed the impact of backdoors on Ethereum rollups. Now, Vitalik is questioning the current dependency of L2 solutions on Ethereum\u2019s main EVM.\n\nIn an article published on December 13, Vitalik Buterin indeed proposes a bold reflection aimed at transcending the existing limits of Layer-2 solutions. Currently, these solutions are tightly dependent on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) of the main network. However, Buterin envisions a transition towards a more direct integration with a native ZK-EVM.\n\nThis proposal raises fundamental questions on:\n\nthe current design of Layer-2 solutions,\n\nthe challenges inherent to such a pronounced dependency.\n\nExploring these implications offers insight into potential changes in how Layer-2 protocols interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This paves the way for more flexible and efficient solutions!\n\nThe envisioned versions of ZK-EVM\n\nThe potential evolution towards a dedicated ZK-EVM presents significant strategic and technical implications. In his article, Buterin precisely explores the reasons behind these choices. Also, he offers an in-depth perspective on how this technology could revolutionize the way smart contracts are executed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe multi-client philosophy in the context of EVM verification emerges as a central element of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s discussions. He explores the advantages and disadvantages of multi-client systems, classifying them as \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d. The crucial question is whether a multi-client system can provide a more resilient and decentralized solution.\n\nVitalik\u2019s innovative ideas thus pave the way for a more transparent and robust Ethereum ecosystem. By inviting the crypto community to embrace innovation, direct ZK-EVM integration foretells a promising future for Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Despite the Bitcoin ETF approval hype, ETH continues to remain largely neutral as other altcoins outperform Ether.

Additionally, the Commission remains unclear on its stance as to whether Ether is a security or a commodity, which makes the approval of an Ethereum ETF highly speculative.\n\nRead more: Hashdex tips spot Bitcoin ETF s to trade by Q2, followed by Ethereum\n\nEthereum price remains neutral-to-bullish\n\nEthereum price action between June 2022 and November 2023, created an ascending triangle setup. This technical formation is a bullish pattern in which the asset price creates higher lows and equal highs. In Ether\u2019s case, three distinctive higher lows and three equal highs formed.\n\nConnecting the equal highs shows a horizontal resistance level at $2,030. This level was broken on November 20, indicating the upside potential of the pattern was activated. The ascending triangle setup forecasts a 43% upswing to the $2,943 level, obtained by measuring the distance of the widest part of the triangle and extrapolating it higher.\n\nEthereum price\u2019s breakout was succeeded by a 16% rally to a local top at $2,403. Since then, ETH has dropped 6.3% and currently trades at $2,252. Going forward, the smart contract token is likely going to move sideways between the ascending triangle\u2019s base at $2,030 and the weekly resistance level at $2,539.\n\nA decisive flip of the $2,539 will open the path for Ethereum price to continue rising to its theoretical target of $2,943 or the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nEthereum\u2019s Social Dominance metric has been trending lower since September 30, showing a decline in interest for ETH among investors.\n\nETH Social Dominance\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, On-chain Volumes saw a spike on November 10 but has been steadily slumping since then. The same can be said about Whale Transaction Count, which has also seen a decline.\n\nETH On-chain Volume, WTC\n\nWhile this is bearish in the short term, the Active Addresses have been in an uptrend since mid-September. Network Growth has also remained consistent, which shows that the investors are being patient about the mid-to-long term outlook.\n\nETH Active Addresses, Network Growth\n\nA decisive breakout above $2,539 could signal a bullish outlook for ETH. In such a case, the Ethereum price could eye a retest of the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $2,030 support level could trigger a 15% crash in Ethereum price to $1,727."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market witnessed a surge in volatility as the digital assets Bitcoin and Ethereum entered into a minor correction. This pullback has plunged the ETH price from a recent top of $2400 to $2238, registering a 7.4% loss. However, this retracement lies within the range of a rising channel pattern and projects the recovery is intact.\n\nAlso Read: Peter Brandt Stirs Debate with Harsh Critique of Ethereum\n\nadvertisement\n\nChannel Pattern Hints Next Jump Above $2500\n\nA channel pattern leads the current recovery trend in the ETH price\n\nUntil the pattern\u2019s lower trendline is intact, the coin holders can enjoy the bull rally\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nSince mid-October, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a robust recovery, beginning with a rebound from the $1522 support level. This rally is best understood through the lens of a channel pattern, characterized by two ascending trendlines that have been providing dynamic resistance and support to the price movements.\n\nOn December 13th, the Ethereum price marked its latest recovery from the lower trendline of this pattern, evidenced by a morning star candle formation. This reversal propelled the price to its current level of $2243, signaling the onset of a new bull cycle within the confines of the channel pattern.\n\nIf the ETH price continues to adhere to the trajectory set by this channel pattern, we could see a 12-15% surge, potentially reaching the upper trendline in the region of $2500 to $2600. As long as these two trendlines remain intact, Ethereum is likely to maintain its upward trajectory, albeit with minor pullbacks along the way.\n\nHowever, a breakout above the channel\u2019s resistance could significantly amplify buying momentum, potentially leading to a more substantial recovery. In such a scenario, initial targets could be set at $2730, with a further potential rise to $3260, marking key milestones in Ether\u2019s bullish journey\n\nCan ETH Price Fall Back to $2000\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum price seems strongly bullish, the rising channel pattern in a strong rally can commonly lead to a decisive breakdown from the lower trendline. This breakdown would likely intensify the selling pressure and trigger a significant correction in ETH price. Thus, under the influence of this pattern, the Ethereum coin may revisit $2000 coin again\n\nBollinger band: Despite the current retracement in the upper boundary of the Bollinger band indicator , indicates the recovery momentum is active.\n\nRelative Strength Index: A lower high formation in the daily RSI slope reflects the weakening of buyers\u2019 strength in the market.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "After a year of dormancy, a significant Ethereum whale has reemerged, creating ripples in the cryptocurrency market, with Lookonchain reporting this unexpected move. The whale, silent for over twelve months, initiated a substantial selling spree, offloading 18,865 ETH for a staggering 42 million DAI through four newly created wallets. This activity translates to an average selling price of $2,229 per ETH.\n\nThe market has been abuzz with speculation and analysis following this development. The revived whale\u2019s actions have led to the sale of a considerable amount of Ethereum, amounting to a current value of $12.5 million, with 5,588 ETH remaining in their possession. This event has caught the attention of both investors and analysts, given the significant amount of cryptocurrency involved and its potential impact on the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrasting Whale Behaviors\n\nThis selling trend by a dormant whale contrasts sharply with the behaviours observed in other segments of the Ethereum whale community. Crypto analyst Ali highlighted a contrasting scenario where several of the largest Ethereum whales have been actively accumulating ETH.\n\nETH/USD price chart\n\nOver the past week, these whales have reportedly added over 100,000 ETH, valued at approximately $230 million, to their holdings. This divergence in strategies underscores the varied approaches and sentiments prevalent among significant investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Current Market Position\n\nAmidst these developments, Ethereum\u2019s market performance remains a focal point. At the time of reporting, ETH experienced a slight upturn, with a 1.12% increase over the last 24 hours, bringing its value to $2,255.\n\nIntoTheBlock data suggests that Ethereum is trading in a crucial zone, with significant support and resistance levels identified. The $2,332 and $2,403 price points are key barriers in ETH\u2019s potential ascent towards the $3,000 mark, while support is around $2,127.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees continue to play a critical role in its market dynamics. The past week saw approximately 35,000 ETH burned, continuing a trend of negative net issuance that started in early November. These factors collectively contribute to the ever-changing landscape of Ethereum\u2019s market as investors and analysts closely watch these developments unfold.\n\nRead Also: XRP Ledger (XRPL) Hosts Phase 2 of Palau Stablecoin Project\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.

        "content": "The ETH/BTC chart has been in a long-term downtrend.\n\nIn comparison, the strength of Bitcoin was clear and is likely to continue.\n\nSince October, Bitcoin [BTC] has rallied by an impressive 57.5% as of press time. In the same period, Ethereum [ETH] gains measured 48.34%. The difference is not much, but ETH has been underperforming for close to a year now.\n\nThis means that during times when Bitcoin runs higher, Ethereum doesn\u2019t achieve equivalent or higher gains. During periods of a downturn, Ethereum prices suffer more than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nIs this trend likely to reverse?\n\nTechnical analysis of the ETH/BTC chart underlined gloom\n\nThe ETH/BTC chart on the one-day timeframe highlighted the downtrend that has been present since early June. The inference was that ETH just wasn\u2019t able to keep up in terms of performance. And the story doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe zone of resistance highlighted at the 0.055 region represented a key resistance zone that ETH bulls will need to breach to reverse their fortunes. However, the market structure was bearish.\n\nThe 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level was tested on 10th November. It was followed by a rapid reversal.\n\nA move below the 0.051 mark would signal that ETH/BTC was headed much further lower. If that happens, traders and investors could exit the ETH market if a higher timeframe bearish market structure break occurs.\n\nAssuming Bitcoin climbs above the $45k key resistance but ETH/BTC falls, participants could look to shift their funds to BTC to ride the trend higher.\n\nAssessing sell pressure on ETH and BTC\n\nA sign that sell pressure is imminent on an asset is if we spot large inflows to exchanges. If that happens, the exchange reserve for the asset would shoot skyward. In the case of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, this has not yet occurred.\n\nThe BTC exchange reserve has consistently trended lower since June. Despite the downtrend, there was a noticeable spike from 5th December to 12th December. Just after this spike, Bitcoin prices tumbled from $43.7k to $41.2k.\n\nThe Ethereum reserves saw less volatility. It, too, was in a downtrend and has been since February 2023.\n\nEthereum saw a small spike in the reserve between 11th-13th December, but the increase came during and after the price drop. This suggested that some holders panicked due to what they perceived as a shift in trend, while BTC\u2019s inflows preceded the fall.\n\nThe inference was Bitcoin reserves and flow could be a more accurate gauge of the next price direction than Ethereum.\n\nHowever, this was based only on the recent spike, and is not a practical finding with a large sample size. Nevertheless it is something to look out for.\n\nWhat is the sentiment of BTC and ETH like?\n\nA look at the social volume for both crypto assets revealed that, as expected, Bitcoin\u2019s social volume was far higher than Ethereum\u2019s. Even so, their trends were pretty similar. This could be because of their price performances being closely interrelated.\n\nWhen Bitcoin rallies, so does Ethereum, but just not as much.\n\nThe MVRV ratio for Bitcoin and Ethereum also showed similar trends, but their magnitudes were vastly different. At press time, BTC stood at 41.17% while ETH was at 26.45%.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBoth values were at their respective six-month highs despite the recent dip in prices. The conclusion was that both assets were overvalued, with Bitcoin holders being at a greater profit, and hence, the happier.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these holders choose to realize their profits en masse and cause a large wave of selling."

        "content": "The blockchain cryptocurrency industry has evolved substantially since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are two top altcoins that have contributed to the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nWhile Ethereum was the first to implement smart contracts, Solana expanded the possibilities by increasing scalability. Both have contributed to the emergence of Pullix (PLX), the new trifecta of crypto success. Let\u2019s find out why Pullix is now referred to as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now.\n\nEthereum Introduces a New Phase in Crypto\n\nEthereum (ETH) is widely considered as the blockchain industry\u2019s backbone. This is because the Ethereum network was the first to provide smart contracts and decentralized apps. The infrastructure has extended throughout the bitcoin industry.\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s popularity has propelled it to the top altcoins in the market today. Ethereum (ETH) is the project that led to the idea of a decentralized future since it created the framework for the launch of many projects.\n\nSolana\u2019s Scalability Increased the Possibilities\n\nWhile Ethereum introduced smart contracts, scalability remained a long-standing issue. In 2017, the Solana network was launched as a game changer. While Ethereum can only handle 8-18 transactions per second (TPS), the Solana network has the potential to handle 65,000 TPS.\n\nThis scalability caused the Solana coin to gain traction. It also led to a massive expansion of the network. The growth of the network has established the Solana coin as one of the top altcoins in the cryptocurrency market today.\n\nThe Emergence of Pullix (PLX)\n\nPullix is now being referred to as a trifecta of crypto success as it combines both concepts introduced by Ethereum and Solana. As an exchange, it combines the decentralization of Ethereum with the great scalability of Solana.\n\nPullix has thus unveiled an exchange platform that exceeds the competitors. As a result, the exchange functions in a safe and decentralized environment. Furthermore, it promotes a transparent trading system that eliminates intermediaries and lowers transaction fees.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s great scalability has enabled it to enter new markets. Users will be able to trade more than just cryptos on Pullix. Users will be able to trade assets from the stock, FX, commodities, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) markets.\n\nPullix has linked its DeFi cryptocurrency, PLX, to the trading platform in order to bring additional incentives to customers. PLX token holders will receive regular passive income transfers via providing liquidity.\n\nDue to these amazing features, there has been great interest in the platform\u2019s DeFi cryptocurrency, PLX. Over the last few days, almost a million PLX tokens have been snapped up. Fortunately, PLX is still available at a great price of $0.042 per token before its projected rally.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe combination of successful two models has made Pullix one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in at the moment. This is the reason why it is referred to as a trifecta of crypto success. Now is a great time to join the project before its projected rally of 100x.\n\nFor more information regarding the Pullix Presale see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities\n\nKeywords: top altcoins, best cryptocurrencies to invest in, DeFi cryptocurrency, altcoins, Ethereum, Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum network, Solana, Solana network, Solana coin\n\nMeta Title: Crypto Trifecta: Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Forge the Path for Pullix (PLX) Success\n\nMeta Description: Find out how Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have paved the way for the success of Pullix (PLX).\n\nShare this article"

        "title": "3 Transformative Cryptos Changing The World: Ethereum (ETH), Everlodge (EDLG), Toncoin (TON) - TechCabal",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency was originally created to transform how we make payments. Now, innovative new projects like Ethereum, Everlodge, and Toncoin are taking things one step further. Each project offers an innovative new solution, and as a result could be extremely profitable for early investors. Here\u2019s why investors should consider each for their portfolios.\n\nEthereum Continues To Pioneer DeFi Developments\n\nEthereum is the largest blockchain in the world. Over 1,500 active decentralized apps have been built on the network, with a total value locked (TVL) of over $1 billion. Many analysts believe that Ethereum is now more important than Bitcoin, and could play a more important role in the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum recently experienced its largest price increase of 2023, rising to over $2,350. It has since declined to $2,232, though Ethereum\u2019s value has still increased by 8.65% in the last month. With huge plans for 2024, including a potential spot ETF, experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s value could surge over the next year. Predictions range from $3,000 to $4,000+, though most experts agree that Ethereum\u2019s value will rise.\n\nToncoin Blockchain Slows Following New Protocol Release\n\nToncoin was created to provide seamless DeFi transactions, offering speeds of over 100,000 transactions per second. However, a recent issue with Toncoins transaction processing has cast a shadow of doubt around the project.\n\nLast Tuesday, a new protocol inspired by Bitcoin Ordinals caused a spike in activity on the Toncoin network. This caused the blockchain\u2019s speed to crash to less than 1 transaction per second on Thursday, during which over 2.5 million transactions were pending.\n\nDue to congestion Tonkeeper, a popular Toncoin wallet, had to suspend its services. Later reports suggest that network usage increased by 61 times in just 30 minutes, causing issues for Toncoin. Since this setback, Toncoin\u2019s value has fallen by 8% to $2.17, and Toncoin\u2019s daily trading volume has fallen to $50 million.\n\nCould Everlodge Revolutionize A Trillion Dollar Market?\n\nWhile most crypto projects focus on finance or the blockchain, Everlodge applies DeFi technology to an entirely new market\u2013 travel properties. As a pioneer in this industry, Everlodge is expected to gain significant traction throughout 2024 as thousands of investors discover a new way to build their property portfolios.\n\nEverlodge looks to disrupt the travel property market by minting properties as NFTs. This is designed to streamline the buying and selling process. Once minted, NFTs are fractionalized so investors can buy a percentage of the property instead of the entire property outright. For example, a holiday home in the U.K. worth $1 million could be split into 5 fractions, after which 5 individuals can own a 20% share in the property.\n\n<blockquote class=\u201dtwitter-tweet\u201d><p lang=\u201den\u201d dir=\u201dltr\u201d>We're thrilled to announce that our website just got a makeover! \ud83d\udcbb<br><br>Check out the fresh look and discover the NEW features we've added.

Properties available on Everlodge will include luxury villas, hotels, and holiday homes, with plans to add more property types in the future.\n\nEverlodge is currently in stage 8 of its presale, having sold out at record rates during its previous seven rounds. Its native token, ELDG, is currently available for just $0.027, and will offer numerous benefits to holders once Everlodge officially launches.\n\nInvestors who buy ELDG tokens during the Everlodge presale will automatically be granted access to the Everlodge private members club, which will offer lucrative rewards such as free stays at properties within the Everlodge ecosystem.\n\nVisit Everlodge\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the largest and most used decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 layer-1 blockchain infrastructure. Its native token, ETH, is also the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with $270 billion at the time of publication.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s price is up 85% in the last year, now trading at $2,249 per token. This surge has rewarded ETH holders, who are now 76% in profit, according to data by IntoTheBlock on December 16.\n\nIn particular, the percentage of Ethereum investors in profit is the same as long-term holders, who have kept their positions for over a year. Both data sets are achieved by looking at all active addresses in the network from the received and spent transactions.\n\nHowever, 23% of all Ethereum wallets are holding a losing ETH position, while 1% acquired the token at current prices. At the same time, 21% of Ethereum holders have held their position for between one and 12 months, while 3% just recently bought ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders data. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIs it time to buy ETH with 76% of Ethereum holders in profit?\n\nIt is important to understand that the higher the number of Ethereum holders in profit, the higher the likelihood of a sell-off, as they might want to realize the, so far, unrealized profit. Therefore, buying ETH right now could mean becoming the profitable exit liquidity for 76% of all Ethereum holders.\n\nMeanwhile, only 46% of the tokens are concentrated in the hands of addresses holding at least 0.1% of its supply. The low concentration of whales and institutional investors lowers the risk of huge coordinated sell-offs. Balancing the previous analysis.\n\nCryptocurrency traders controversially believe we are experiencing either a bull rally in a bear market or a bull market already. Understanding the current status of cryptocurrencies is essential to make a profitable decision of buying or not buying ETH.\n\nMoreover, further developments and DeFi ecosystem growth for Ethereum could generate more demand for its token. An increased demand would drive ETH prices up, while a reduced demand would create an opposite outcome.\n\nAll things considered, the decision to buy ETH is personal, and investors must be aware of the risks. Essentially, having a good risk management start is necessary while investing in such a volatile and experimental market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
