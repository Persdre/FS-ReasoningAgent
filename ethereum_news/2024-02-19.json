        "title": "Selling Ethereum in 2024: is now the right time? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts and far-reaching dApps. If you wish to trade in ETH, you need to analyze the project\u2019s performance, trends, upgrades and updates, and basically any other aspect that could impact its price. This will help you determine the right time to sell or buy ETH. Depending on these factors, you may then decide to hold onto your ETH or convert ETH to USD.\n\nHere, we examine Ethereum in more detail to help you determine whether now is the perfect time to sell your ETH.\n\nWhat Is Unique about Ethereum\u2019s Technology?\n\nThe Ethereum network is an open-source protocol that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It supports an immense ecosystem of decentralized apps as a pioneer of blockchain smart contracts. Since its inception, Ethereum has been a pacesetter in digital trends such as NFTs, GameFi, Web3, Metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThanks to the network\u2019s vast applications, serious concerns have emerged regarding its massive energy consumption, high transaction costs, and scalability. Some investors are already considering selling ETH in preference to its competitors \u2014 Solana, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, and Cardano. You can read more about some of these crypto projects on the Paybis blog.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Updates and Upgrades\n\nEthereum 2.0 reduces gas fees and increases transaction speed from 30 TPS to 100,000 TPS. The goal is to ensure ETH is more usable with increased adoption to grow and stabilize its price.\n\nThe upgrade also saw Ethereum move from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This migration helped the network to reduce its carbon footprint by over 90%.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum has been long in the pipeline. It started with the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, and ever since, we\u2019ve witnessed the Berlin and London upgrades.\n\nOther notable upgrades that followed included Arrow Glacier, Gray Glacier, Bellatrix, and Paris. The last three were collectively referred to as \u2018The Merge.\u2019\n\nIn 2023, the Uniswap V4, a new smart contract protocol, was launched. However, Ethereum\u2019s developers also recently rolled out the Shanghai upgrade that would allow ETH validators to unlock staked ETH, making rewards accessible.\n\nHow Has Ethereum Performed in Previous Years?\n\nLooking back at Ethereum\u2019s ICO, we see how affordable the coin was at just $0.31. Up until 2016, the price averaged less than $1. ETH skyrocketed to an all-time high of $1,270 in 2018 but the real bull run came in 2021 when it hit an unprecedented $4,891.\n\nSince then, the crypto market has experienced a bearish market, which saw most crypto projects shed a lot of their value. The crypto asset plunged to $890 on June 18, 2022, but has recovered well to register a 130% price gain from its current price. However, it\u2019s important to note that it still grapples with a 58% decrease from its ATH.\n\nNavigating through the highs and lows, Ethereum faced heightened volatility throughout 2023. Towards the end of October, the entire crypto market received a significant boost fueled by the anticipation of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval in the coming months. This optimism propelled the price of ETH upward, breaching the $2,000 mark on November 9th for the first time since July.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Ethereum?\n\nLooking at expertly derived technical charts for Ethereum, there\u2019s a strong indication that the price will pull through the $2,300 resistance point.\n\nOnce Ethereum 2.0 updates and upgrades start fully rolling out, experts have forecast ETH to hit $2,700 in 2024 and $3,000 by 2025.\n\nSeasoned analysts and market veterans exhibit a bullish sentiment toward Ethereum, maintaining an optimistic outlook on its future price trajectory. Some even project that Ethereum could reach an impressive $40,000 by 2030. These forward-looking expectations underscore the confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential for substantial growth and sustained value over the coming decade.\n\nConclusion\n\nTransformative Ethereum 2.0 updates are poised to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and sustainability. With the current ETH price at $2,500 and a market cap of more than $300 billion, the crypto market continues to showcase Ethereum\u2019s resilience.\n\nAs the crypto landscape evolves, staying informed and adaptable is crucial when considering selling ETH. Consider diversifying your portfolio away from Ethereum, you can exchange ETH for up-and-coming competitors such as Solana, Polkadot, Binance, or the more established Bitcoin."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH) touched $3,000 for the first time since April 2022, just before the entire crypto market entered a brutal bear market.\n\nThe price of ETH stands at $3,000, according to CoinMarketCap data, representing a more than 3.4% 24-hour rise. Over the past week, it has risen by 13%.\n\nThe last time the second-largest cryptocurrency stood at the $3,000 mark was nearly 22 months ago. One month later, the crypto project Terra collapsed, bringing the price of every digital coin and token with it. ETH has struggled to recover since then.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA lot is now happening in the Ethereum world today, however, and there is more interest in the asset than before. A number of high-profile Wall Street fund managers have proposed spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIf approved, traditional investors would have access to ETH in a safe and regulated way. The likes of BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck are hoping to get the green light from the regulator.\n\nLast month, British multinational bank Standard Chartered projected that a spot ETH ETF will likely get approved by May\u2014and then it'll only go up in price.\n\nETH's network is also about to undergo a vital upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun.\" The improvement will bring \"proto-danksharding\" to the blockchain, promising to make it faster and cheaper to use.\n\nETH is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Commodity or Security? No One Knows When it Comes to Ethereum (ETH) - Securities.io",
        "content": "If Bitcoin is the most representative asset of the crypto world, Ethereum has helped the principle of decentralization find its footing in the blockchain world and beyond. Ethereum-powered smart contracts have helped build applications that have eventually led on-chain transactions and communication to become intermediary-free in a trustless and secure fashion.\n\nFrom encouraging a fairer financial system to tokenizing real-life assets and empowering us with an open internet \u2013 free from monopolizing entities controlling user data \u2013 Ethereum has been at the forefront of making the blockchain-powered world a more democratic, equitable, and innovative space. It is no wonder that Ethereum occupies close to one-fifth of the crypto world's market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite being one of the most catalyzing assets, Ethereum has been finding itself in regulatory limbo for quite some time now.\n\nClick here to learn what Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) means.\n\nGary Gensler's Interview and the Uncertainty around ETH's status\n\nThe current US President, Joseph R. Biden, nominated Gary Gensler as Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2021.\n\nIn an interview given on Monday, June 27, 2022, Gensler characterized Bitcoin as a commodity but \u201crefused to lump Ethereum's Ether, the No. 2 cryptocurrency, under the same label.\u201d This reluctance to characterize Ethereum led to confusion regarding whether Ethereum was a commodity or security.\n\nIf it were a security, any sale and purchase with its use would count as capital gain, requiring it to be reported to the IRS, essentially making it unusable for small purchases.\n\nMore importantly, Ethereum's security status would put it under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission and all the restrictions that SEC regulations bring.\n\nWhile this mist of uncertainty and confusion surrounding Ethereum could be far-reaching in its impact since many crypto and blockchain projects are dependent upon it, we shall discuss some of the most crucial concerns that have arisen of late.\n\nETF applications: Will SEC Approve?\n\nWith as many as 11 Bitcoin ETFs recently getting approval, speculations are rife about whether Ether ETFs experience the same outcome. When asked about this, the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, did not disclose anything decisive. According to press reports that came out after Gensler's Squawk Box interview with CNBC on February 14, \u201cGensler simply indicated that the process would be handled in precisely the same way as Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA list of Ether ETF applications has been delayed and postponed by the SEC so far, including that of:\n\nInvesco\n\nGrayscale\n\nFidelity\n\nBlackRock\n\nVanEck\n\nHashdex\n\nFranklin Templeton also filed for spot Ether ETF on February 12. The SEC will come out with its decision on these applications in the days to come. For instance, it would decide on:\n\n\n\nVanEck \u2013 May 23rd\n\nARK 21 \u2013 May 24th\n\nHashdex \u2013 May 30th\n\nFollowing these, by June 18, it would decide on Grayscale's application, leading up to decisions on Invesco's by July 5. Concluding this sequence, by August 3rd and 7th, it would address Fidelity's and Blackrock's applications, respectively.\n\nWhile many ETH ETFs are in the pipeline for approval, experts are of the opinion that introducing the feature of staking can add more value. While advocating for staking as a future add-on, market experts believe that the initial Ethereum ETFs will be of a \u2018plain vanilla' structure, where ETFs will track the spot price of Ethereum as a first iteration.\n\nHowever, incorporating staking rewards into these instruments would mean rewarding any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators. These validators would subsequently propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain to receive freshly minted ETH and a portion of the block transaction fees. According to an estimate, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH could earn an extra 32 ETH on a monthly basis.\n\nThere are several advantages of introducing staking to ETH ETFs. It would enhance the fund's revenue and ensure Ethereum's network security, fostering the active participation of validators to make the network more robust and resilient.\n\nIntegral to Ethereum, the presence of staking rewards to ETH ETFs signifies full ownership of the asset, allowing fund managers to innovate with these staking rewards in compensating their investors. They can opt to provide dividends or increase the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, offering win-win propositions for all stakeholders involved. However, for now, it would be too early to make credible forecasts on the shape Ether ETFs are to take in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, we may discuss the next agenda on our list, which we have termed the curious case of the Prometheum listing.\n\nThe Curious Case of Prometheum's Listing ETH as a Security\n\nPrometheum claims itself as an entity that has been building the Future of Markets. It claims to be providing solutions for \u2018digital asset securities investing \u2014 bringing together a blockchain-powered platform with the benefits of a securities-regulated marketplace.' It also positions itself as an SEC and FINRA-registered entity that is into building the necessary connection between trad-fi systems and crypto investing. In short, it wants to do crypto differently by offering a platform where one can buy and sell digital asset securities in a securities setting.\n\nWithin this service environment, Prometheum has hit the headlines by announcing, to begin with, custody of ETH as its first digital asset. The move has baffled several crypto industry experts for multiple reasons. Let us look at a few of them.\n\nPrometheum enlisting ETH as a security could prove the claim of the pro-Ethereum lobby that it could be handled in the United States in a way that satisfies the regulatory authorities. Its ETH security service offering would also alter the way the United States authorities have asked businesses so far to come and do crypto business in the US.\n\nSpeculations are already doing the rounds that Prometheum's entry may force the Security and Exchange Commission to declare Ethereum as a security. And if the SEC does so, it could mean Prometheum holds a monopoly over the ETH security trading market.\n\nWhile Prometheum's approach towards ETH may seem innovative and aspirational in a market that is fast-evolving and burgeoning, industry analysts are apprehensive. And they've their reasons for their anxiety.\n\nFounded by Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum had its first regulatory approval in 2021. The Prometheum Ember ATS Inc. received approval to operate its ATS and provide accredited and non-accredited investors with the choice to buy, sell, and manage digital asset securities.\n\nIt hit the news when it went on to have a second and unusual regulatory approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA. The approval was to operate as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. Created as a category by the SEC in 2021, no one had managed to attain such approval before Prometheum.\n\nHowever, this dual approval from the SEC and FINRA did not make things more credible for legal experts in the field. While Prometheum claimed that it had found a viable route for crypto trading, the legal experts argued that the platform did not have any assets available for trading.\n\nSome also argued that SEC's approval and Prometheum's trading under its regulatory scheme compelled everyone to see ETH as a security, while it could be a commodity like gold or oil. It is essentially the dilemma that we have been discussing here. However, the Kaplan brothers appeared quite sure of their assessment of cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nThey also put forth the argument that it is possible for their platform to list cryptocurrencies, like ETH, as securities under the exemption known as Rule 144. Rule 144 is put into use when one decides to facilitate trades in restricted stocks.\n\nNot only legal and regulatory experts but also the entry and manipulation of Prometheum have caused a stir in the US political world, as several Republican lawmakers have already begun pointing fingers at Gary Gensler. According to their allegations, Prometheum is nothing but Gensler's stooge that he has been using to drive his regulatory agenda.\n\nThe claim of the Republicans gained enough steam when Prometheum received an invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto when it had very little experience in the space compared to many of its peers.\n\nAll these claims and counter-claims have added to the confusion and regulatory limbo that Ethereum had already found itself in more than a year ago and counting.\n\nThe third and final stream of confusion flowing around Ethereum is mostly because of its own evolutionary nature, and it has to do with the launch of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe Launch of a New Ethereum: What's in Store for the New Projects?\n\nEthereum's transition from a Proof of Work mechanism to a Proof of Stake mechanism was radical in many aspects. Ethereum 1.0, or Ethereum mainnet, which helped many innovative projects develop and flourish, operated on the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, allowing for the mining of ETH tokens.\n\nFrom September 15, 2022 onwards, Ethereum shifted to Proof of Stake, which involved the verification of transactions by staking. Of course, the transition was meant to achieve better results in the areas of network efficiency, security, and scalability.\n\nHowever, the differences between Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 covered more ground than mere performance improvement. It had its impact on the areas of a consensus protocol, blockchain conception, security, speed, energy, scalability, and gas fees.\n\nMany experts believe that the advent of Ethereum 2.0 has been like scoring a self-goal against one's own team. The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 made it possible for regular users to leverage the rewards that were earlier meant for miners. Now, everyday users can avail the same benefits by holding any ETH liquid-staking derivative.\n\nMany big players in the industry, like Coinbase and Frax, were quick to hop on this bandwagon. They promptly released ETH liquid staking derivatives. These derivatives were as beneficial as a regular ETH and were also a yield-generating asset. Like other derivatives, these ones offered exposure to the price movement of the underlying asset, ETH in this case, while maintaining liquidity and keeping staking benefits available.\n\nIn the long run, these ETH liquid staking tokens proved to be more capital-efficient than regular ETH, thereby offering very little incentive for the average user to hold onto ETH, especially considering that the primary benefit of holding ETH was the potential for price appreciation. However, with the advent of this shift, individuals now had the opportunity to invest in a liquid staking derivative, which not only retained the value proposition of ETH but also enhanced user profits through staking yields.\n\nThe evolution of Ethereum prompted many projects to integrate liquid staking Ether into protocols. Many who could not keep up with the shift had to face the risk of going into oblivion.\n\nEthereum: Dabbling in Status, Unfazed in Value\n\nWith all this confusion and doubt surrounding its status, one thing remains steady, and that is the value that Ethereum brings to the table in the world of decentralization. It continues to be a technology that helps digital money and global payment applications flourish, helping create a sustainable, wholesome economy.\n\nIn this economy, creators can earn online, and the unbanked population can access finance, significantly altering the traditional dynamics of lending and borrowing, making them more people-centric by freeing them from the clutches of intermediaries.\n\nMany real-world assets that were considered to be less liquid could be tokenized and moved across the board more freely. The tokenization of these assets made the system of selling and buying more transparent and traceable. Funds could easily reach where they belonged without requiring cost-bearing, complicated intermediaries to facilitate their movement and take a cut.\n\nWhile Ethereum's value as a tool geared towards development, growth, and prosperity in the Web3 world remains unmatched, its market and investment status need more clarity. While it is necessary to keep an eye on how the Prometheum story unfolds, we must also wait for the SEC's decisions on Ethereum ETFs.\n\nStarting from the end of May to August, one after another, these decisions will become public. Perhaps that will be the time for ETH to come out of the regulatory limbo and emerge as the game-changing asset that it had promised to be!\n\nClick here to learn all about investing in Ethereum (ETH)."

        "title": "Ethereum price approaches $3k amidst spot ETF anticipation, Dencun upgrade - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The price of Ethereum (ETH) approached $3,000 on Feb. 19 amidst anticipation concerning developments that are expected to occur in the coming months.\n\nAs of 8:35 pm UTC, ETH was priced at $2,937 with a market capitalization of $352.96 billion. That change represents 4.12% growth over 24 hours \u2014 significantly greater than Bitcoin\u2019s 0.4% gains over the same period and also greater than the crypto market\u2019s overall 1.2% gains.\n\nLido Staked Ether (STETH) saw comparable gains of 3.88% over 24 hours. Ethereum 2.0 staking tokens as a category saw gains of 5.4%, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nEthereum was responsible for a relatively small portion of 24-hour liquidations. The asset accounted for $35.48 million of liquidations, including $8.43 million in long liquidations and $27.05 in short liquidations.\n\nGrowth may be due to ETF anticipation, Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum\u2019s latest gains may be connected to the possibility that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThough no significant regulatory developments around spot Ethereum ETFs occurred today, a relevant report from the brokerage firm Bernstein received widespread coverage. Analysts at the company predicted a 50% chance that a spot Ethereum ETF will be approved by May and a near-certain chance that such a fund will be approved within one year. Combined with other similar predictions in past months, this report may have affected investor sentiment and market activity.\n\nSome backlash has also emerged around Ethereum\u2019s ETF prospects. Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer suggested that Coinbase\u2019s leading role as an ETF custodian could compromise Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model by allowing the firm to \u201ccontrol the entire network.\u201d\n\nData from Dune Analytics suggests that Coinbase is currently responsible for about 15% of all ETH staking, while another staking platform, Lido, is responsible for more than 31%. Because it is unknown how much crypto might be held in spot ETH ETFs, it is unclear whether Coinbase could gain dominance by holding funds on behalf of those ETFs. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the SEC will permit staking of ETH held in spot Ethereum ETFs, though some applicants aim to do so.\n\nApart from those ETF prospects, there is also significant anticipation around Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, which is set to take place on March 13. That upgrade will notably include proto-danksharding, a feature expected to improve ETH transaction costs and scalability.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 10:39 pm UTC on Feb. 19, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 2.69% over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "Digital assets in the artificial intelligence sector continued their recent surge, increasing by 10%, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that the technology could help the blockchain network mitigate its \u201cbiggest technical risk.\u201d\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s data show that several tokens in the sector, including SingularityNET\u2019s AGIX, 0x0.ai, Ocean Protocol\u2019s OCEAN, The Graph\u2019s GRT, Fetch.AI\u2019s FET, and others, rose more than 10%, respectively, during the past day, pushing the sector\u2019s market capitalization to $18.06 billion and its trading volume to approximately $2.5 billion.\n\nHow AI can aid Ethereum\n\nAccording to Buterin, AI technology could help blockchain network developers identify bugs and assist with the verification of codes.\n\n\u201cRight now ethereum\u2019s biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing,\u201d he added.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of his recent exploration of the synergy between AI and crypto, detailed in a blog post on Jan. 30. Buterin outlined various potential applications of AI within the crypto sphere.\n\nHe pointed out that integrating AI could revolutionize crypto-systems, particularly in scenarios where individual participants are replaced by AI entities, enabling more efficient operation on a micro-scale.\n\nWhile recognizing AI integration\u2019s functionality and safety enhancements, Buterin also urged caution, especially in high-value and high-risk settings.\n\nBeyond Ethereum, other protocols and exchanges like Solana, Polkadot, Binance, and stake.link also explore AI-driven solutions.\n\nHowever, despite the enthusiasm for AI, concerns linger regarding its efficacy in bug detection. Daniel \u201cHaxx\u201d Stenberg of cURL highlighted potential challenges, including the risk of AI-generated false positives complicating bug identification efforts.\n\n\u201cAn (AI-generated) security report can take away a developer from fixing a really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on fixing bugs or developing a new feature,\u201d Stenberg argued.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum has climbed almost 4% since yesterday at a current price of $2,910 and a staggering 28% since the start of the month\u2014and analysts say there's reason to believe ETH could go even higher.\n\nAt the time of writing, there's less than a month left before Ethereum developers bring the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade to Ethereum mainnet. The upgrade will bring \"proto-danksharding\" to the leading proof-of-stake blockchain. It's a technical improvement that promises to reduce data availability costs and address some key scalability challenges. In short, it'll make Ethereum faster and cheaper.\n\nThere's also growing optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could this year approve a spot Etheruem ETF to begin trading. That optimism got a lot more potent after the SEC last month approved 10 different Bitcoin ETFs, which have since seen $3 billion worth of net flows.\n\nOne of the main indicators that traders like where ETH is headed: Options and futures contracts. On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shared a post from pseudonymous crypto trader Greatest_Trader that suggests that climbing open interest hints at increased confidence among traders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWill Ethereum Reach an ATH in 2024? \u201cNotably, the chart reveals a significant surge in open interest, coinciding with #Ethereum's upward price trend, reaching its peak levels since July 2022.\u201d \u2013 By @Greatest_Trader Link \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/GWHqi4Q4bA \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 19, 2024\n\n\"However, given the impulsive nature of the recent ascent, traders should exercise caution and consider the potential for sudden liquidation events, which could trigger notable short to mid-term price declines,\" they wrote.\n\nSure enough, there's currently $10.6 billion worth of open interest in Ethereum futures contracts, according to CoinGlass.\n\nOpen interest represents the value of open options and futures contracts for a particular asset. That value has climbed by 6% in the past day alone\u2014and it's not that far off the $11 billion worth of open interest traders saw during the last big bull run in November 2021. At the time, ETH was trading above $4,800 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrading volume is another market indicator that analysts have been watching.\n\nSo far this year, Ethereum volumes have tended to pick up when there's been big news about Bitcoin\u2014notably the approval and subsequent trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nOver the three-day period after Bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S., Ethereum saw $130 billion worth of trading volume, according to CoinGecko data, clearing $40 billion each of those days. The main driver at the time appeared to be optimism that if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had approved Bitcoin ETFs to trade, then it would be no time before it did the same for pending Ethereum ETFs applications.\n\nMore recently, though, volume has slowed down to around $15-25 billion per day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe TOTAL VALUE LOCKED in #ETHEREUM L2s just hit another ALL-TIME HIGH! $26.95 BILLION and counting!\ud83d\udcc8 2024 is the year of #ETH.

Transaction totals processed by layer-2 scaling networks like Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism have seldom been higher than they are right now. L2Beat, an Ethereum scaling network analytics platform, shows tht they collectively reached 92 transactions per second as of yesterday\u2014which is 6.8 times more than what's being transacted on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAnd all that activity has brought the total value of assets locked on layer-2s to an all-time high of nearly $27 billion, according to L2Beat.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Filecoin, and Hedera Are on Fire Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Speculation about cryptocurrency ETFs continues, but a lot is going on under the crypto hood.\n\nThe crypto market's hot streak is continuing, and since the market closed on Friday, there have been some big movers. And in some of these cases, the moves have been driven by real developments, not just hype.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.88%) has risen as much as 8.1% since the stock market closed on Friday, Filecoin (FIL -0.78%) jumped by 40.7%, and Hedera (HBAR -2.34%) was up 38.7%. As of noon ET Tuesday, the tokens were up 5.4%, 30%, and 22.1% since Friday.\n\nBig crypto moves all around\n\nEthereum is rising in part because traders are still speculating that regulators will approve more crypto ETFs beyond the Bitcoin (BTC -0.45%) ETFs launched in the last few months. The next coin that is likely to get approval for one is Ethereum because of its size and recognition in the market.\n\nIf an ETF were approved, the purchasing activity around the coin could push Ethereum higher, in a similar fashion to the way Bitcoin has responded. Just last week, $2.4 billion flowed into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFilecoin's rise was prompted by more fundamental news: It announced it will store Solana's (SOL -0.46%) block history, allowing Solana to move to more decentralized storage. This should be a win for both cryptocurrencies; Solana can now focus more attention on expanding the high-throughput network while Filecoin gets a significant partner.\n\nLesser-known token Hedera is benefiting from the growth in its SaucerSwap decentralized exchange, which now has over $127 million in total locked value, a gauge of how much investors are putting into the exchanges on the ecosystem.\n\nBuilding the foundation of crypto's future\n\nIndividually, these moves may seem small. But together, they tell a story about where crypto is headed in the near future.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have been approved, which suggests that eventually, ETFs for Ethereum and other tokens could arrive too, bringing more money into the ecosystem and driving values higher. If an Ethereum ETF gets approved, there may soon be dozens of crypto ETFs.\n\nThe Filecoin and Hedera news is more useful for the industry long term. As more tokens and exchanges are launched, it's necessary for market makers to put value into the ecosystem, and that's part of what we're seeing with the SaucerSwap exchange. Filecoin helping Solana store its blockchain history moves that token toward the decentralized vision that so many advocates would like to see.\n\nIf Solana and Filecoin can work together to create an extremely fast, high-throughput blockchain with accessible storage, it would be a win for all blockchain users. This is where I think we will see more utility and financial products built in the near future.\n\nCrypto is maturing before our eyes\n\nTwo years ago, crypto was still in the speculative trading days, and speculation in that market still exists, but major tokens like this are now focused on building real utility on blockchains. If that utility is combined with more investors putting money into the crypto ecosystem, it could create a reinforcing loop of value creation."

        "content": "Closely followed analyst Benjamin Cowen says Ethereum may be in the midst of repeating a historical pattern that could bring ETH down to much lower levels.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 790,000 YouTube subscribers that in the last crypto bear market, Ethereum didn\u2019t bottom out until canceling out a previous breakout from a rising wedge and then retesting a macro low.\n\nHe also notes that ETH crashed immediately after the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair broke down.\n\nWith ETH/BTC teetering on support, Cowen says that the next breakdown could be what leads to a leg down for ETH/USD, which he says may see Ethereum trading at the $1,200 level.\n\n\u201cIt was not only the process of the unvinversion of the yield curve, but it was also the breakdown of the ETH/BTC valuation.\n\nIf you look at the ETH/BTC valuation, you will notice it was precisely here in July of 2019 when ETH/BTC broke down. And in July of 2019, that is where ETH/USD started to go down [from $362.39], and that is where ETH/USD went back through this wedge and came all the way back down here ($118).\n\nYou will notice in fact, that this low that ETH put in in December 2019, was actually slightly above this higher low [at $95]. This higher low here [November 2022] happened to be around $1,000, so if it\u2019s going to play out in a similar fashion \u2013 which it very well might not \u2013 it would imply going back and testing that low.\n\nBut again, you will notice that this drop did not occur until after the ETH/BTC valuation broke down. It was after ETH/BTC broke down that ETH/USD finally got this drop. And where are we today? We are close to seeing a very similar process play out.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading at 0.05581 BTC ($2,927), still above Cowen\u2019s support at 0.049 BTC ($2,570).\n\n?\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Record-breaking inflows from Bitcoin ETFs and institutional entities in recent weeks has been a major driver behind the market rally.\n\nETH witnessed an unusual spurt in the trading activity in UTC morning hours on Feb. 19, likely due to strategic investors looking to place bullish bets ahead of the resumption of Bitcoin ETF trading sessions in the US.\n\nSantiment\u2019s daily trading volume tracks the nominal value of confirmed transactions involving a particular cryptocurrency within a 24 hour period.\n\nThe chart below illustrates an initial drop-off in ETH trading at the close of Bitcoin ETF trading on Friday Feb. 16. But since then, it has been on a remarkable rise.\n\nAt the time of writing around 10:30 hrs GMT on Feb. 19, ETH trading volume has surged to $26.7 billion, the highest since Jan. 11.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Trading Volume vs. Price | Source: Santiment\n\nTypically, rising trading volume is bullish for a number of reasons. Firstly, it signals strong investor interest in the underlying cryptocurrency. But more importantly, heightened market liquidity allows investors to execute trades at favorable prices without scuttling the upward price momentum\n\nBitcoin ETFs acquired over 17,000 BTC in the last trading week between Feb. 12 and Feb. 16. If they continue on the same trajectory, the trading volume on Ethereum and other mega-cap altcoins could rise even further, during the previous week.\n\nInvestors shifted ETH worth $220M into long-term savings in 3 days\n\nThe flow of Ethereum on exchanges since the close of trading on Feb. 16 is another critical metric pointing towards investors\u2019 conviction of another bullish week ahead.\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s Exchange Reserves metric tracks the total number of coins deposited in exchange-hosted wallets and recognized trading platforms. This serves as a proxy for measuring investors\u2019 tendency to sell in the short-term.\n\nAs depicted in the chart below, investors held opening balances of 14,060,510 ETH as of Feb. 16.\n\nBut interestingly, investors shipped over 80,222 ETH coins into long-term storage and staking contracts in the last 3 days, leaving only 13,980,288 ETH in their trading wallets at press time on Feb. 19.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Exchange Reserves vs. Price | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nA decline in exchange reserves often impacts asset price positively, as it effectively leads to a temporary cut in market supply. Unsurprisingly, a closer look at the chart shows how ETH price has been on an uptrend since the exchange reserves began to drop rapidly in November 2023.\n\nValued at the 5-day Simple Moving Average price of $2,730, investors have shifted approximately $220 million worth of ETH into long-term storage.\n\nReducing the market supply, by such a large margin could further accelerate the rally if the market momentum remains bullish in the week ahead.\n\nForecast: can Ethereum price reach $3,500?\n\nBased on the trading volume and exchange reserves trends analyzed above, there\u2019s an overwhelming bullish sentiment among investors that ETH price could make another leg-up toward $3,500 in the week ahead.\n\nHowever, ETH currently faces a looming sell-wall at the $3,000 psychological resistance.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s global in/out of the money data shows that 4.5 million addresses received 1.7 million ETH inflows at the average price of $3,049. Considering they had been holding at a loss for nearly 3-years a number of them could look to take some profits.\n\nBut if the bull can scale this resistance zone, a breakout toward $3,500 could be on the cards.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the downside, the bears could regain a foothold in the market if they can force a reversal below $2,000. However, as seen above, the 4 million addresses acquired 3.3 million ETH at a minimum price of $2,640.\n\nTo avoid dipping into losses, those investors could make frantic purchases to cover their positions, and possibly, trigger an instant ETH price rebound."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price surged over 9% in the past week, while Bitcoin was up around 3%.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum (ETH) is setting its sights on the $3,000 mark as the Dencun upgrade inches closer. According to data from TradingView, Ethereum\u2019s price has exceeded $2,980 in the last 24 hours, up over 27% year-to-date. This milestone marks Ethereum\u2019s most triumphant return to the $2,900 range since May 2022.\n\nThis surge in Ethereum\u2019s valuation is largely attributed to a confluence of positive market developments and speculative anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAccording to data from SpotOnChain, a whale has recently amassed a staggering 54,721 ETH, valued at over $150 million, through transactions on Binance and the decentralized exchange 1inch, averaging a purchase price of over $2,845 per ETH.\n\nFurther examination of this whale\u2019s portfolio via the SpotOnChain reveals a current holding of 74,383 ETH, equating to around $216 million. This accumulation signifies a near tripling of their Ethereum holdings in just 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to the ETH holdings, this investor also acquired about 5,485 stETH, liquid staking assets from Lido Finance, valued at nearly $16 million.\n\nLiquid staking on Ethereum has attracted a huge amount of users. The total value locked in the liquid staking protocols has skyrocketed almost 600% since January last year, as reported by DeFiLlama . With the Dencun upgrade underway, liquid staking on Ethereum might see even greater growth in the future.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade will introduce several improvements, including the highly-anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), or \u201cProto-Danksharding.\u201d This feature is expected to significantly reduce transaction fees, particularly benefiting layer 2 rollup chains.\n\nApart from the Dencun upgrade, there\u2019s also a lot of hype surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, with prominent asset managers such as BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Franklin Templeton among the eight filing for the investment fund.\n\nMay 23 is a critical date for a potential spot Ethereum ETF as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prepares to rule on VanEck\u2019s application. Interestingly, some developments experienced during the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs are resurfacing, as seen in ARK Invest and VanEck\u2019s recent update to their spot Ethereum ETF filings.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s price rally from around $27,500 to over $46,900 (according to data from CoinGecko) leading up to the decision on its spot ETF, March is shaping up to be a defining month for Ethereum."

This broad-based ETH rally reflects strengthening long-term trends, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s supply outlook is more constructive than Bitcoin in the future.\n\nWith the Merge upgrade implementation on a date by Ethereum on September 15, 2022, now being a successful proof-of-stake blockchain, the circulating supply of ether has stopped growing significantly. Therefore, Bitcoin is fixed money, unchanged in quantity, and we will endeavor to do that because it is a halving process.\n\nSpecifically, on the net, Ethereum\u2019s supply has fallen 0.209% year-over-year as 1.05 million ETH has been issued while 1.41 million has been burned or removed from circulation. Meanwhile, according to crypto data service Ultrasound figures, bitcoin\u2019s supply increased by 1.71% over the same period.\n\nThe forthcoming iteration of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun in March intends to enhance the platform\u2019s scalability and capacity to support complex and more sophisticated applications. Moreover, the market anticipates SEC-positive decisions, which will launch the first U.S. spot ETFs tracking ether\u2019s price by the end of this year.\n\nWith more fundamentals becoming Ethereum-centric, traders view limitless possibilities for either to thrive at the expense of Bitcoin, even after mass adoption."

        "content": "Ethereum price surged past $3,000 on Feb. 20, eclipsing Bitcoin\u2019s 22% growth; ETH 2.0 staking deposit trends observed this week suggest the gap could widen even further.\n\nThe media frenzy surrounding the Bitcoin ETF approval saw BTC price outperform ETH in the early days of the 2024 market rally. However, this market trend has flipped since the start of February.\n\nAs investors make long-term bets, the bulls may capitalize on the rising ETH 2.0 staking deposits and declining market supply to drive a rally above $4,000.\n\nEthereum surpasses BTC despite record-breaking ETF inflows\n\nBitcoin has dominated media headlines in recent weeks and for good reason. Since the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, BTC has received unprecedented interest from institutional inflows.\n\nAs of Feb. 19, after barely six weeks of trading, the 10 newly-launched ETFs had acquired over 654,000 BTC, worth more than $36 billion. Despite the record-breaking BTC ETF inflows, ETH price performance has managed to skip past BTC.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Performance | Feb.1 to Feb. 20, 2023 | Source: TradingView\n\nThe historical price chart shows that BTC prices increased 24.2% in February, rising from $41,864 to a monthly peak of $52,985.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH price has delivered a much more impressive showing, with a 33.7% rise from $2,241 to the $3,000 milestone on Feb. 20, the first time since Apr. 26, 2022.\n\nInvestors place long-term bets on Ethereum\n\nThanks to the seamlessly executed Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has received its fair share of media praise.\n\nThe on-chain data trail shows that investors playing the long game, staking coins to front-run gains from an imminent ETH ETF approval, have been pivotal to ETH\u2019s blistering price action, which eclipsed BTC in February.\n\nInvestors have pulled coins worth over $1.5 billion in the past week as they deposited 504,799 ETH into ETH 2.0 staking contracts on Feb. 13 and Feb. 20.\n\nThis saw the total staking deposits on the Proof of Stake (PoS) network rise to 30,064,242 ETH, according to the official data culled from the Beacon chain.\n\nInvestors Deposit 504,799 ETH into Ethereum 2.0 Beacon.chain | Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 20 | Source: BeaconCha.in\n\nDuring a bull market, a significant increase in staking deposits is a positive trend for any PoS network. An increase in staking deposits enhances network security and stability amid rising network activity and signals that most large ETH investors are looking to play the long game despite elevated prices.\n\nA $1.5 billion increase in ETH staking while prices are trending at a 2-year peak indicates a surge in investor confidence and commitment to the network\u2019s security.\n\nIf this trend persists, the drop-off in market supply amid soaring market demand could see ETH price extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead, especially considering that the Bitcoin network lacks a comparable large-scale staking yield incentive.\n\nForecast: Can Ethereum\u2019s price reach $3,500?\n\nDrawing data-driven insights from market trends, ETH price appears primed for further upswing toward $3,500 in the weeks ahead.\n\nHowever, historical accumulation trends suggest that ETH faces stiff resistance at the $3,200 territory.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s global in/out of the money (GIOM) data groups all existing ETH investors by their entry prices. The GIOM shows that 12.9 million existing holders had acquired 4.74 million ETH at the minimum price of $3,212.\n\nHowever, considering this is the largest cluster of holders that bought ETH above the current prices, a decisive breakout above $3,200 could effectively open the door to a larger upswing towards the $3,500 mark, as predicted.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, February 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe bears could still invalidate this lofty prediction if the price tumbles below $2,500. Still, in this scenario, the 5.2 million addresses that acquired 4.1 million ETH at the minimum price of $2,548 could mount a significant buy-wall."

ETH price upswing comes after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s latest post regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and its use cases in crypto.\n\nVitalik Buterin Hints At AI Integration in Ethereum?\n\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin has been actively looking at artificial intelligence (AI) recently, talking about its pros and cons. He recently talked about how crypto and AI overlap, pointing out potential use cases and risks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Buterin expressed his excitement about artificial intelligence in a blog post on February 19. The use of AI in formal code verification and bug detection is one application about which he is quite enthusiastic. According to him, code problems represent \u201cEthereum\u2019s biggest technical risk pro\u201d at the moment, and AI will revolutionize bug remediation.\n\n\u201cOne application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding. Right now Ethereum\u2019s biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing,\u201d said Buterin.\n\nAptos Labs\u2019 Wolfgang Grieskamp commented that the design of the EVM, unfortunately, makes verification very hard, with difficulty in discovering simple control flow because of indirect branching. \u201cNot sure whether AI will help here.

Citing a website maintained by Ethereum Foundation developers, Buterin said it will enable stateless validator clients, allowing staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync almost instantly.

        "content": "Ethereum has recently surged with notable momentum, signaling a bullish uptrend.\n\nThis increase has seen the price reclaim a critical resistance level, reflecting strong buyer confidence and market participant optimism.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals a significant shift in market sentiment, characterized by an impulsive uptrend and heightened bullish momentum.\n\nAccordingly, the price has approached a crucial multi-year resistance zone \u2013 the psychological barrier at $2.9K and successfully surpassed it.\n\nThis indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment among market participants, with buyers dominating the market. The trend appears sustainable, with eyes set on surpassing the major yearly swing high at $3.6K. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the only concern is the emergence of an expanded bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, signaling a possible short to mid-term correction or consolidation phase before the next surge.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nAnalyzing the 4-hour chart, a significant price reversal can be observed near the multi-month ascending trendline, supported by substantial buying pressure. This upward momentum led to a breakthrough above a crucial prior major swing high, establishing a new higher high. The above underscores the presence of active buyers targeting higher resistance levels.\n\nWith the price reclaiming a significant resistance zone and completing a pullback to the broken level, the trajectory is expected to remain bullish with intermittent downward corrections. However, given prevailing market conditions, periods of heightened volatility may lead to notable price fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s recent price surge and reclaiming of crucial resistance levels signify strong buyer confidence and a sustainable bullish trend. While short to mid-term corrections are possible, the overall outlook remains positive, with buyers likely to continue driving the market toward higher price targets.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price has steadily climbed from the significant support level of $1.5K to surpass $2.8K in recent months, investors are keen to gain insights from futures market sentiment analysis.\n\nThe chart illustrates the open interest metric across all exchanges, representing the total number of open futures contracts, regardless of the trade direction. Higher values signify increased confidence among futures traders in the prevailing trend, while lower values indicate uncertainty. Moreover, heightened open interest often correlates with heightened price volatility, as it amplifies the probability of cascading liquidations.\n\nNotably, the chart reveals a significant surge in open interest, coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s upward price trend, reaching its peak levels since July 2022. This surge indicates sustained confidence among futures traders in Ethereum\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nHowever, given the impulsive nature of the recent ascent, traders should exercise caution and consider the potential for sudden liquidation events, which could trigger notable short to mid-term price declines."

This significant activity comes as the price of Ethereum nears the $3,000 mark, a bullish signal for investors and enthusiasts alike. According to a recent tweet by Spot On Chain, a notable cryptocurrency analysis firm, the anonymous whale has executed a series of strategic purchases within the last 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcquiring a staggering 54,721 ETH, these transactions were meticulously carried out through a combination of withdrawals from Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and swaps on 1inch, a renowned decentralized exchange aggregator. The detailed breakdown of the transactions reveals that the whale withdrew 19,226 ETH, valued at approximately $55.6 million, from Binance.\n\nAdditionally, the investor swapped 10.1 million USDT (Tether) for 3,493 ETH, equivalent to about $65.7 million, through 1inch, at an average price of roughly $2,893 per ETH in the past few hours. This flurry of activity underscores the Ethereum whale's aggressive investment strategy and belief in Ethereum's long-term value.\n\nEthereum approaches $3,000\n\nThis massive accumulation of ETH by the whale has occurred amid a significant uptick in Ethereum's market price and trading volume. The current price of ETH stands at $2,906, marking a 3.69% increase in the last 24 hours and an impressive 16.51% surge in the past week. The 24-hour trading volume for Ethereum has also experienced a substantial boost, witnessing a 53.44% rise to reach $26.65 billion.\n\nThese metrics not only reflect the growing investor confidence in Ethereum but also highlight the cryptocurrency's resilience and potential for future growth. The Ethereum community and broader cryptocurrency market are abuzz with speculation regarding the implications of this whale's actions. Such substantial investments by high-net-worth individuals or entities often signal a bullish outlook on the asset's future price movement.\n\nAnalysts suggest that this could potentially lead to increased institutional interest in Ethereum, further propelling its price upward as it edges closer to the coveted $3,000 milestone. Overall, the market watches with bated breath, anticipating the next wave of developments in this ever-evolving space."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto tokens tied to prominent blockchain games\u2014and the networks that support them\u2014are broadly surging amid the Bitcoin and Ethereum boom, with a number of tokens launched within the last year rising to new all-time high prices over the past day.\n\nThe tokens tied to gaming networks Xai (XAI) and Beam (BEAM) are among those that reached new peak prices, according to data from CoinGecko, along with the tokens of crypto games Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) and Parallel (PRIME).\n\nXAI, the token from the Arbitrum-based layer-3 gaming network of the same name, spiked to a new peak price of $1.39 overnight before settling slightly to $1.30 as of this writing. At the current price, XAI has a market cap of $359 million, and the token has jumped into the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It\u2019s up 13% over the past 24 hours and 19% on the week.\n\nThe token just launched in January as Xai rolled out a sizable airdrop to operators of Sentry Nodes, which support the network, as well as owners of certain NFTs tied to the gaming network. The total value of that 125 million XAI airdrop now sits above $162 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBEAM, the token of the Beam gaming network built on an Avalanche subnet, is up 10% today to a current price of just above $0.035. It\u2019s down only slightly from an all-time high of nearly $0.036 on Monday morning.\n\nBeam is operated by Merit Circle, a gaming DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), and has also integrated with Immutable zkEVM, an Ethereum scaling network for games. With a market cap of nearly $1.8 billion, BEAM is the 53rd largest cryptocurrency overall by market cap and the second-largest gaming-centric token behind Immutable (IMX).\n\nPRIME, the token of crypto trading card game Parallel, also set an all-time high price of $14.84 late Sunday, though it has dipped nearly 7% since to a current price just above $13. Parallel, GG\u2019s 2023 game of the year, recently launched a new season of in-game content and has been teasing an open beta launch in the near future. It\u2019s currently in closed beta.\n\nAnd MAVIA, the newly launched token of mobile strategy game Heroes of Mavia, pumped Sunday to a new all-time high price of $10.59. It has marked a sharper decline since surging to that peak, however, now down about 14% on the day to about $8.50 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMAVIA debuted less than two weeks ago and has spiked 370% since its initial launch. The Clash of Clans-style crypto game rolled out an extensive roadmap over the weekend, showing off plans for additional NFT staking rewards, an upcoming announcement of a layer-2 scaling network to power the game\u2019s crypto elements, and other bonuses and features ahead.\n\nMavia's February Community Update: Tokenomics, Game Stats, Roadmap and more!https://t.co/6OipmDj4Ta \u2014 Heroes of Mavia (@MaviaGame) February 17, 2024\n\nHeroes of Mavia was released on iOS and Android in January and airdropped tokens to 100,000 players and NFT landholders. Developer Skrice Studios now says that it has logged over 2 million downloads for the game, with 278,000 daily active users.\n\nAll four of these tokens initially launched within the last year, including two of them so far in 2024. That\u2019s an important detail as some of the other largest gaming-centric crypto tokens are longer-running coins that set much higher peaks during the bull market runs of 2021 and 2022.\n\nFor example, coins like IMX, The Sandbox (SAND), ApeCoin (APE), and Gala Games (GALA) remain well short of their all-time high prices\u2014and all of those except Immutable are down more than 90% from such peaks. Immutable has risen 74% over the past 30 days, yet it is still down 65% from its all-time high price of $9.52 set in 2021.\n\nThe past day\u2019s gaming token spikes came amid the launch of PIXEL, the long-awaited token of buzzy crypto farming game Pixels on the Ronin Network. PIXEL has pumped 24% since the Monday morning debut to a current price above $0.62, putting its market cap at $821 million.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's recent price trajectory has been met with a stark rejection, as it encountered a near-impenetrable resistance level that has halted its upward momentum. This resistance confluence is particularly formidable as it aligns with the 100, 50 and 200 EMAs, key technical indicators closely monitored by traders for significant price movements.\n\nThe current price level has proven to be a substantial barrier for XRP, as the EMAs have converged to form a tight band of resistance. This band has effectively capped the price, acting as a ceiling that XRP has struggled to breach. The close proximity of these EMAs indicates a critical decision point for the asset; a break above could signal a strong bullish turn, while continued rejection may cement the current level as a robust ceiling.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the noticeable lack of trading volume. Volume acts as fuel for price movements, with higher volumes often associated with strong price action. The tepid volume accompanying XRP's approach to this resistance suggests a lack of conviction among buyers, which can often precede a price retreat.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the resistance zone around $0.58 to $0.60 is the area of interest. XRP's recent approach to this level was met with swift denial, indicating that overcoming this barrier will require a significant influx of buyer interest and volume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the support side, the $0.50 level is one to watch. It has served as a historical psychological and technical support level, providing a foundation for price rebounds in the past. Should XRP retreat, the response of buyers at this level could determine the asset's short-term fate.\n\nEthereum almost there\n\nEthereum is on the cusp of breaching the pivotal $3,000 mark, showcasing formidable strength in an otherwise tepid market. Its resilience and upward momentum may well act as a catalyst for broader market optimism.\n\nThe ascent toward $3,000 has been marked by consistent higher lows and higher highs, a bullish pattern that suggests strong buying interest at every dip. Technical indicators have turned favorable, with Ethereum recently pushing past the 50-day and 100-day EMAs \u2014 a sign that the momentum could sustain.\n\nSupport levels for ETH have been notably robust. The primary support at the $2,750 mark, which aligns with the 50-day EMA, has been defended well by the bulls. This level is critical as it has been tested multiple times, proving to be a springboard for subsequent rallies. On the upside, the psychological and technical barrier of $3,000 stands as the next significant challenge. A decisive close above this level could open the gates for further exploration into uncharted price territories, with potential intermediate resistance at $3,200.\n\nETH's exceptional performance can be partly attributed to the ongoing development within its ecosystem. The introduction of ERC-404, a new token standard that combines the versatility of NFTs with the fungibility of standard tokens, is an innovation that could further solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nBitcoin faces opposition\n\nExamination of the BTC chart reveals that the asset is experiencing a consolidation phase, which is often a precursor to a trend continuation rather than a sign of stagnation.\n\nCurrently trading above the $50,000 mark, Bitcoin has maintained a steady position near this psychological threshold. The consolidation phase is characterized by a narrowing price range, with Bitcoin oscillating between support and resistance levels that converge over time. This tightening of price movement is often associated with the accumulation of assets by traders and investors, setting the stage for a potential breakout.\n\nThe key support level for Bitcoin lies around the $48,000 area, which aligns with the 50-day EMA. This level has been tested and held firm on several occasions, indicating strong buying interest. On the flip side, the immediate resistance is located near the $53,000 mark. A convincing break above this level could signal a bullish continuation, potentially targeting previous highs or setting new records."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFixedFloat\u2014a cryptocurrency exchange that operates without \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC) anti-money laundering (AML) measures\u2014was hacked earlier this month, resulting in the loss of more than 400 Bitcoin and over 1,700 Ethereum, worth about $26 million.\n\nBlockchain security firm BlockFence identified the Bitcoin address used in the theft, and on-chain data from a linked Ethereum address revealed multiple high-value transactions to various addresses.\n\nAccording to fellow blockchain analytics firm PeckShield, the stolen funds were moved through the Ethereum mixer eXch shortly after the hack, complicating the traceability of the stolen assets. A small part of the funds were moved to HitBTC and CoinSpot, PeckShield said, labeling the wallet address \u201cFixedFloat drainer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFixedFloat told Decrypt that the hack was not carried out by one of its employees and that \u201cit was an external attack caused by vulnerabilities in our security structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem was in our infrastructure, which was compromised due to flaws and insufficient protection,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis allowed the attackers to gain access to some of the functions of our service.\u201d\n\nFollowing the hack, FixedFloat initially cited \"minor technical problems\" and moved its systems into \u201cmaintenance mode.\u201d This was before the full extent of the hack was disclosed, which led to confusion and concern among users.\n\n\u201cWe did not immediately report the hack, as we were already aware of the incident and immediately began putting our service into maintenance mode to ensure security and minimize losses,\u201d the exchange told Decrypt. \u201cAt that time, our main focus was on quickly eliminating weaknesses and strengthening overall security, which prevented us from making public statements about what happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a subsequent statement, FixedFloat assured customers their funds were safe, clarifying that the financial losses impacted only the service itself and not user-held assets. \"FixedFloat does not perform the functions of a custodial service\u2014that is, it does not store user funds. We will provide more information later,\" the platform tweeted.\n\nHowever, once reports of the hack started to spread through social media, the platform confirmed the incident and opened up about the attack.\n\n\"We confirm that there was indeed a hack and theft of funds,\u201d the official FixedFloat Twitter account wrote in a reply to a tweet. \u201dWe are not ready to make public comments about this matter as we are working to eliminate all possible vulnerabilities, improve security, and investigate.\n\n\u201cOur service will be available again soon,\" it continued.\n\nHello, We confirm that there was indeed a hack and theft of funds. We are not yet ready to make public comments on this matter, as we are working to eliminate all possible vulnerabilities, improve security, and investigate. Our service will be available again soon. We will\u2026 \u2014 FixedFloat\u26a1\ufe0f (@FixedFloat) February 18, 2024\n\nThe exchange later assured that users\u2019 funds remained safe and the funds stolen affected only the company\u2019s internal operations. If so, it\u2019s likely that the hack was from one of the exchange\u2019s hot wallets.\n\nThe official FixedFloat site remains inoperative at time of writing.\n\nImage: FixedFloat\n\nFixedFloat, which advertises itself as an \"instant, fully automatic cryptocurrency exchange with Lightning Network,\" prioritizes privacy over safety, operating without requiring account registration or identity verification. This lack of KYC measures is appealing to privacy-conscious users, but it poses significant risks for both the platform and its users in the event of a hack, as investigators have limited information to work with.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIncidents like this are less common than they were. A recent report from blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis highlighted a significant decrease in funds stolen from cryptocurrency platforms in 2023. Despite a slight increase in individual hacking incidents, the total value of stolen funds dropped by approximately 54.3% to $1.7 billion, attributed largely to a sharp decline in DeFi hacks.\n\nFixedFloat reported that they are working with law enforcement agencies, blockchain forensics firms, and cryptocurrency exchanges to track down the hackers, who have not yet contacted the exchange. The company said it will honor all its payment obligations as soon as it resumes operations and can be certain that the exchange is once again safe to use.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Data shows that retail traders are staying on the sidelines for now, but activity related to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has remained at high levels, with spot bitcoin EFT issuer BlackRock on pace to overtake Microstrategy Inc. as the largest holder of bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, a new research paper found that cyber attacks on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) would be \u201ceconomically unfeasible.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Stalls After Scaling $50,000\n\nBitcoin soared past the $52,000 mark last week, marking its highest point in more than two years. Despite this surge, there are indications a slowdown may be looming.\n\nLate last week, Swissblock analysts said the $52,000 level is a significant resistance point, suggesting a temporary retreat may be necessary to sustain the current bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum Labeled 'Unfeasible'\n\nA recently published research paper has shed light on the robust security measures in place for Bitcoin and Ethereum, rendering 51% attacks economically impractical.\n\nResearchers found that these attacks aren't feasible due to the significant costs and logistical hurdles involved. These findings underscore a pivotal evolution in the security of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the researchers said.\n\nDecentralized Crypto Exchange Fixedfloat Hacked\n\nElsewhere, it was reported Sunday on social media platform X that decentralized crypto exchange FixedFloat was hacked for $26 million worth of bitcoin and ether. The operators of the exchange have been criticized for not immediately reporting the hack, which took place earlier this month.\n\nWhat To Expect From Crypto Markets This Week\n\nA popular topic of conversation among traders this week is the potential approval of an ETH ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNotably, the latest ETH ETF application from money management firm VanEck doesn't include staking, which is a departure from previous filings from fund managers ARK Invest Management LLC and Franklin Templeton.\n\nAccording to research released Monday by brokerage firm Bernstein, there is a 50% chance that an ETH ETF gets approved by May and it could be \"well-positioned for mainstream institutional adoption\u201d in the crypto market.\n\nSeparately, many analysts are tracking STRK, which is the new native token of Ethereum Layer 2 protocol Starknet.\n\nAfter briefly trading as high as $5, STRK has settled around the $2 mark on CoinMarketCap Tuesday. It temporarily reached a multibillion-dollar market capitalization after being airdropped to millions of users in what's been called the largest such distribution this year."

        "content": "Ethereum price has tested the $3,000 psychological level, a threshold last hit in 2022.\n\nETH could drop 10%, giving sidelined investors another entry before next leg up.\n\nThe bearish thesis will be invalidated if the PoS token records a higher high above the $3,004 peak.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has managed to test a crucial milestone for the first time in months, which is a remarkable show of strength considering Bitcoin (BTC) price has hinted at a fall. This means that Ether has managed to sidestep the BTC cue, causing markets to speculate on whether another alt season is underway.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nEthereum tests $3,000 after almost two years\n\nEthereum (ETH) price scrapped the $3,000 psychological level on Tuesday, a level last tested on April 26, 2022, almost two years ago. It comes a day after the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token outperformed BTC with double-digit weekly gains and a spike in Open Interest.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, Ethereum price has slumped 0.78%, causing up to $15.47 million in short positions to be liquidated against $20 million of long positions. The disparity shows that most traders anticipated the surge in Ethereum price and took long positions, only that their take profits were higher such that their margin accounts could no longer support the open positions.\n\nETH liquidations\n\nAs it stands, Ethereum price is suffering the aftermath of an overbought asset, seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 70. Traders looking to take new long positions should probably wait as the ETH market is at high risk of a pullback to the south.\n\nSuch a directional bias could provide sidelined or late investors a buying opportunity around the $2,689 support level before the next leg up. This would denote a 10% fall below current levels.\n\nIn a dire case, Ethereum price could slip below the aforementioned level to test the $2,500 level. Or ETH could find support at the $2,388 critical support.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bulls show strength, Ethereum price could reclaim the $3,000 milestone, potentially going as high as to reclaim the $3,004 range high. A decisive candlestick close above this local top on the daily timeframe would invalidate the bearish thesis.\n\nIs an alt season coming?\n\nMeanwhile, speculation has it that the bold move by Ethereum price against BTC\u2019s price consolidation could be the beginning of an alt season.\n\nAlt season is a colloquial term that is used to describe a phase where investing in altcoins provides better returns compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Consequently, the dominance that Bitcoin holds in the market declines, and that of altcoins increases. The alt season indicator from BlockchainCenter is also leaning in favor of a potential altcoin season taking place as opposed to a Bitcoin season.\n\nAlt season index\n\nQuick summary of an alt season in play\n\nFresh capital enters the cryptocurrency ecosystem, effectively flowing into stablecoins, Bitcoin or Ethereum on preference that they are relatively safe: check! Markets rally as a consequence of this capital influx: check! The profit from these ecosystems, along with the new capital, moves into altcoins: in progress This rotation of capital triggers an alt season: possible result!\n\nThe chart above provides a visual representation."

Spotify said this policy forced it to increase monthly subscriptions for its premium service from \u00a39.99 ($12.60) a month to \u00a312.99.\n\nAround the same time, Apple launched a competing music streaming service that cost \u00a39.99 a month.\n\nThe fine over alleged breaches of EU competition law expected to be announced early next month, the FT reported.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: BoE's rate decisions risk prolonging recession, says ex-chief economist\n\nIf imposed, the fine would be one of the most substantial financial penalties the EU has imposed on a major technology company.\n\nEthereum price has hit over $2,900 as the cryptocurrency's co-founder Vitalik Buterin hinted at AI integration.\n\nIn a tweet, Buterin said he believes AI will revolutionise bug fixing, citing bugs in code as \u201cEthereum\u2019s biggest technical risk pro\u201d right now.\n\nOne application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding.\n\n\n\nRight now ethereum's biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 19, 2024\n\nThe comments come as Ethereum closes in on implementing its long-awaited Dencun upgrade, which is currently slated for launch on 13 March.\n\nSantander has announced plans to pay shareholders \u20ac5.5bn (\u00a34.7bn) after posting record profits last year amid surging interest rates.\n\nThe lender, which is owned by Spanish parent Banco Santander, plans to buy back nearly \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) of its shares and pay a final cash dividend for 2023 of \u20ac0.095 per share.\n\nRead more: UK average house price rises by more than \u00a33,000 in 2024\n\nSpain\u2019s largest lender has received regulatory approval for the buyback that will be launched on Feb. 20, it said in a regulatory filing Monday.\n\nIt comes after the Spanish bank posted a record \u20ac11.1bn (\u00a39.5bn) profit for 2023.\n\nChinese online shopping giant JD.com (JD) has confirmed it has been exploring a takeover of Currys, raising the prospect of a bidding war after the electricals retailer on Saturday rejected a private equity approach.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares rocketed higher amid a potential bidding war.\n\nJD.com has held informal, exploratory talks in recent weeks with Currys, the Telegraph said.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe move comes hours after it was revealed that the electrical goods retailer rejected a takeover approach from US investment firm Elliott.\n\nCurrys, which operates more than 800 stores globally and employs 28,000 people, said the offer valued the business at about \u00a3700m.

        "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has made a bullish prediction for Ethereum, suggesting that it could soar to $4,500.\n\nVan de Poppe believes Ethereum is soaking up Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum as investment capital shifts to ETH. According to the analyst, this is a \u201cmassive period to be rotating from Bitcoin towards Ethereum.\u201d\n\n#Ethereum is on its way towards $3,800-4,500. pic.twitter.com/TfoBGloBsH \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 19, 2024\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast comes amidst Ethereum\u2019s recent surge in price, which saw a 9% increase in seven days and 17.5% in one month. Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies have experienced notable gains as well, with MATIC and OP surging by 5% and 6%, respectively.\n\nOn Monday, ETH tapped $3K, its highest in nearly two years, signaling a bullish trend. The recent price surge could be attributed to the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC, following the footsteps of Bitcoin.\n\nSome experts, such as Tom Crown (CEO of Crown Analysis), believe the upswing could continue in the following days, predicting ETH\u2019s surge to $3,300 before the end of February.\n\nAnother person who outlined an optimistic scenario is Raoul Pal (co-founder and CEO of Real Vision). Earlier this month, he forecasted that ETH could rise to as high as $20,000 during the next bull cycle, while BTC could hit the astonishing $250,000.\n\nThe X (Twitter) user Altcoin Gordon was also quite bullish, setting a price tag of $11,250 to be reached by the end of the ongoing year.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s current market strength could be further bolstered by the upcoming Dencun upgrade, or a short-term peak of BTC, according to the analyst.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Could Boost ETH\u2019s Price\n\nThe Dencun upgrade aims to address Ethereum\u2019s limitations in transaction speed and cost. By implementing sharding \u2014a concept involving breaking network data into smaller \u201cshards\u201d\u2014 the upgrade aims to increase the overall computation throughput on the Ethereum network, making it more competitive with faster networks like Solana.\n\nVitalik Buterin underscored the Dencun upgrade as a significant development for Ethereum and its accompanying Layer-2s.\n\nAccording to Buterin, Dencun is a big step towards making Ethereum more \u201crollup-friendly\u201d while enhancing scalability and reducing costs on transactions.\n\nBesides the Dencun upgrade, the integration of Verkle trees on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to streamline Ethereum nodes\u2019 storage needs while maintaining their block validation capabilities, enhancing efficiency and decentralization within the network\n\nMeanwhile, another factor that could increase Ethereum\u2019s price is the approval of a spot in the ETH ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a recent social media post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stressed the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing the way code is verified and bugs are identified within the Ethereum network.\n\nButerin expressed his enthusiasm for AI-assisted formal verification of code, pointing out that the greatest technical risk facing Ethereum today stems from bugs in its code.\n\nThe integration of AI into the development process, he believes, could significantly mitigate these risks, ensuring a more secure and reliable blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAI-assisted code verification explained\n\nAt the heart of Buterin's excitement is the concept of AI-assisted formal verification, a process that could dramatically alter the landscape of blockchain security and efficiency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormal verification refers to the use of mathematical models to prove or disprove the correctness of a system's underlying algorithms, ensuring that they behave exactly as intended under all possible conditions.\n\nBy leveraging AI in this context, developers can automate and enhance the detection of errors and vulnerabilities in smart contracts and other blockchain-related code, potentially preventing costly exploits and failures.\n\nThis approach not only promises to improve the robustness of Ethereum's blockchain but also represents a significant step forward in the broader field of software development, where bugs and security flaws remain a pervasive challenge.\n\nButerin's fascinating AI takes\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Buterin also showcased his wit with a humorous take on the evolution of AI technology. Through a playful post, he contrasted the dramatic, often menacing portrayal of AI in movies with the reality of today's conversational AI.\n\nHowever, he has previously voiced concerns about the existential risks posed by superintelligent AI, suggesting that unchecked advancements in AI could lead to outcomes where humans are no longer the dominant force.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the converging use cases of AI and blockchain offer significant potential, particularly when AI is integrated into existing mechanisms to enhance micro-scale operations, proving to be both promising and straightforward to implement. However, the creation of a \"singleton\" - a single, decentralized, trusted AI through blockchain and cryptographic techniques - presents considerable challenges and risks."

        "title": "This Ether staking protocol doubles rewards of dominant Lido to win $1.5bn slice of market - DLNews",
        "content": "Liquid staking protocols are pulling out all the stops to attract deposits.\n\nMantle's liquid staking protocol currently offers an annual Ether staking yield of over 7%, subsidised by the yield on its own staked Ether.\n\nOther liquid staking protocols are taking different approaches.\n\nIn the competitive sector of Ether liquid staking, it\u2019s difficult for newer entrants to stand out.\n\nFor the past three years, Lido, the leading liquid staking protocol with over $29 billion of deposits, has dominated the sector. As one of the first liquid staking protocols on the market, Lido is established and battle-tested.\n\nIts liquid staking token \u2014 stETH \u2014 is also the most traded liquid staking token on decentralised exchanges.\n\nIn an attempt to chip away at Lido\u2019s dominance, smaller players are coming up with new ways to lure in investors.\n\nOne such project is Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain that has also launched its own liquid staking protocol. It advertises an annual Ether staking yield of over 7% \u2014 almost double the 3.8% Lido offers.\n\nBut to achieve the high yield, Mantle subsidises staking rewards using the staked Ether in its own treasury. This means Mantle is giving away the staking rewards on its Ether to keep the yield on its liquid staking token \u2014 called mETH \u2014 above 7%.\n\n\u201cUsers love the yield,\u201d 0xVEER, Mantle\u2019s pseudonymous head of business development, told DL News.\n\nThe hope is that by subsidising yields, Mantle can catch up to Lido and carve out a slice of the $37 billion Ether liquid staking market for itself.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut it\u2019s not alone \u2014 other liquid staking protocols, both old and new, are banking on a variety of strategies to increase their share of the market.\n\nMantle\u2019s mETH success\n\nAccording to 0xVEER, Mantle plans to keep subsidising the mETH yields until April 1 as part of its \u201cmETH Double Dose Drive\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cThe ticker symbol has also become a bit of a meme for obvious reasons, which certainly helps with creating some buzz and getting people to talk about mETH,\u201d 0xVEER said.\n\nAnd DeFi users are piling in. Over the past month, the amount of Ether staked through Mantle has jumped 65%. The protocol now controls over $1.5 billion worth of Ether, or around 3.8% of all Ether staked through liquid staking protocols.\n\nThe value of deposits locked up in Mantle's Ether liquid staking protocol.\n\nHowever, there are limitations to Mantle\u2019s boosted mETH yields.\n\nTo ensure yields stay high, Mantle initially capped the supply of mETH to 250,000. The cap now sits at 520,420 mETH, of which 511,081 has already been minted, per the Mantle website.\n\nWith limited capacity, Mantle can\u2019t keep subsidising the mETH yield forever. At some point its campaign will stop, and there will be little it can do to stop stakers from going elsewhere.\n\nOne way Mantle is attempting to keep mETH stakers around is by \u201chinting at ecosystem incentives for those who bridge mETH from Ethereum to Mantle Network,\u201d according to 0xVEER.\n\nIf users bridge their mETH over to Mantle, it may make it less likely they will convert it back into Ether.\n\nDifferent approaches\n\nOther liquid staking protocols use different strategies to compete.\n\nSwell, a newer entrant to the liquid staking market, has promised a token airdrop. Stakers can earn points for staking Ether through the protocol and using the swETH liquid staking token in DeFi. Points will then be converted into tokens at a later date.\n\nSo far, Swell has attracted over $734 million worth of deposits with this strategy.\n\nRocket Pool, the second-biggest liquid staking protocol behind Lido with some $3.3 billion of deposits, focuses more on protocol design and ideology than on incentives.\n\nIt calls itself the leading decentralised liquid staking protocol because of its more than 3,500 individual validator operators. It lets users run their own validator nodes \u2014 software that helps process transactions on Ethereum in return for staking rewards \u2014 with just eight Ether, compared with the standard 32 Ether required.\n\nLido, on the other hand, has just 37 validator node operators.\n\nBack over at Mantle, there are signs that maintaining a higher-than-average yield is becoming difficult. Although the protocol targets a 7.2% annual yield for mETH, it often falls short of that target. On February 19, the mETH token\u2019s five-day average yield sat at 6.76%.\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped the token\u2019s outsized growth compared with its peers \u2014 just two months after launch, it\u2019s become the fourth-largest Ether liquid staking token.\n\nDisclosure: The author of this article holds Swell\u2019s swETH liquid staking token.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum is trying to break the $3,000 wall: on-chain analysis and ETH price - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we take a look at the general outlook of Ethereum, conducting a detailed analysis of the price and observing some on-chain indicators.\n\nYesterday, ETH tried in vain to break through the $3,000 wall, which is currently acting as the main resistance, being rejected back to the current price of $2,908.\n\nHowever, Ethereum remains the most fit in the crypto market, outperforming even Bitcoin.\n\nOn the on-chain front, data shows a long-standing and strong network, supported by an increase in the number of validators and coins locked in staking, as well as a high average trading volume.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nEthereum leads FOMO in the crypto markets: ETH price analysis shows the asset\u2019s willingness to break the $3,000 resistance\n\nIn this beginning of the week, decidedly quiet, due to yesterday\u2019s closure of the US markets for President\u2019s day holiday, crypto markets are led by Ethereum and its recent attempt to surpass the key price of 3,000 USD.\n\nWhile Bitcoin registered its local maximum on Thursday, February 15th, at a level of 52,816 USD, Ethereum showed more determination by reaching a new annual high of 2,984 USD yesterday, without however succeeding in closing at a round figure.\n\nThe price analysis shows a relative strength for ETH, which convincingly absorbs every dip and keeps market expectations high.\n\nTraders are optimistic about the future of ether and are betting on the positive outcome of the approval of the spot ETF in the USA for the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with several Fund Managers such as Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark and 21Shares, Grayscale, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy and Hashdex that have already filed their requests with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIf things were to go well, ETH could even approach $3,500, a level not seen since April 2022, and then probably even $4,000 ETH.\n\nJust to give an idea of the timing, the SEC still has 96 days before the final deadline to make a decision on the potential approval/rejection\n\nThe final deadline for the Spot #Ethereum ETF is in 96 days! pic.twitter.com/LAXn70q7AG \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) February 17, 2024\n\nOn the more technical side of prices, the analysis highlights how since October 2023 Ethereum has been channeled into a very compact bullish trend, capable of holding the EMA 50 daily very firmly and constantly updating new highs after each short correction attempt.\n\nMore in detail, from mid-January onwards the bulls have made themselves heard in a unanimous way, bringing the prices of ether from $2,200 up to the current values.\n\nThe psychological threshold of $3,000 could now oppose new bullish incursions, with RSI showing the first signs of weakening in a trend that is heading towards overbought territory.\n\nAnyway, the consistently high volumes recorded in the last trading sessions and the recent breakout above 2,700 USD seem to favor a positive scenario for the cryptocurrency, which will likely break the resistance it is facing, albeit after several efforts.\n\nDaily chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USD)\n\nIn the field of derivatives, data analysis on Ethereum highlights a decidedly encouraging open interest, which last week reached an aggregated value on all trading platforms exceeding 7.7 billion dollars, a value that has not been seen since November 2021.\n\nEven the funding rate shows positive signals with a positive leverage funding rate on all major markets, and with numbers higher than those recorded in the last 6 months.\n\nThis means that the speculative interest in Ethereum is high and that speculators are positioning themselves (and have largely already positioned themselves) with the idea that the crypto will increase in price in the short term.\n\nPay attention to the volatility in this period because it could lead to forced liquidations: in particular, the levels of 2,877 USD, 2,870 USD, and 2,840 USD are the prices that could trigger losses for long positions excessively exposed to leverage.\n\nWeekly chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USD)\n\nThe on-chain data of the Ethereum network\n\nAfter analyzing the price of Ethereum, let\u2019s see what the on-chain data of the decentralized network are signaling to us.\n\nEven in this case the overall outlook is largely positive, with most indicators showing the presence of a fertile ground for further growth of the asset.\n\nIn particular, we observe how the number of ETH deposited on the Beacon Chain is constantly growing, as well as the number of new validators joining the network to provide their support.\n\nAs of today, about 30.87 million ETH, equivalent to over 9 billion dollars, are locked inside the protocol PoS with about 900 thousand validators among individual users and LST platforms.\n\nConsidering a circulating supply of Ethereum close to 120 million coins, we can affirm that over 25% of all ETH in circulation are locked in the Beacon chain.\n\nThis only serves to decrease the potential selling pressure and cause a scarcity of ether in the crypto markets.\n\nThis data, combined with the potential digital scarcity that will be triggered by the likely arrival of ETH spot ETFs, could push the currency towards very ambitious price levels if demand starts to be felt even slightly.\n\nIt is also very interesting to note how the average volume recorded in transactions on the Ethereum chain has remained consistently high in these first weeks of 2024, reaching the maximum level of 4 billion USD daily, reached as a maximum in March 2023.\n\nA high volume supports speculative interest in the price of ETH, which coincidentally has increased precisely in conjunction with the cryptocurrency rally from October onwards.\n\nAirdrops, fomo for new DeFi protocols and new memecoins have supported the network\u2019s trading volume throughout 2023, with a boost in metrics in the last few months.\n\nIn conclusion, it is considered appropriate to show this analysis that indicates the number of on-chain Ethereum addresses that hold an average purchase price lower than the current prices, therefore they are in profit.\n\nIt is worth noting how from November onwards the percentage of profitable addresses compared to the total network has skyrocketed, going from 40% to the current 94%.\n\nThis means that 94 out of 100 addresses have a positive PNL compared to their purchase price and could potentially unload their positions at any moment.\n\nUsually in the past, when the percentage of addresses in gain has reached this value, very violent selling sessions have followed which have led to a sharp drop in the price of ETH.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this value remained high for several months during the previous bull market, so in this case too we may see a long time pass before the storm arrives."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop 10% after a weeklong consolidation with BTC bulls showing exhaustion.\n\nEthereum price is likely to revisit $2,800, a 5% fall that could trigger a cascade of losses.\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000 as XRP bulls show strength on the heels of SEC lawsuit conclusion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price\u2019s bullish breakout appears to be losing steam, with the sentiment spreading across the market and leaving Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins in general susceptible to a crash. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price is an outlier, pushing north on the heels of developments in the legal front.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price likely to drop 10% as US markets commemorate Presidents\u2019 Day\n\nBitcoin likely to correct before next leg up\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting resistance at $52,768 blockade, a roadblock that has stood for the past week. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dejected and moving horizontally, coupled with its position at 79, BTC is overbought, a status that often precipitates a correction.\n\nLikely targets in a southbound directional bias would be the 78.6% and 61.8% Fibonacci levels, at $49,786 and $47,445, respectively. In a dire case, Bitcoin price could roll over to the 50% Fibonacci level at $45,801, 12% below current levels.\n\nThe Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator also suggests a possible correction, having increased above 1 as a 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This is bolstered by fading histogram bars on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nNotably, however, the bulls still have a presence in the BTC market, seen with the status of the MACD in positive territory. If these traders act, Bitcoin price could push north, clearing the $52,768 blockade and potentially record a new range high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price bullish outlook inspires IntoTheBlock\u2019s 85% forecast of BTC at a new ATH by August\n\nEthereum price likely to revisit $2,800\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has outperformed BTC. However, it appears to be delaying the inevitable as altcoins await the Bitcoin cue. The RSI shows ETH is already overbought, worsened by the SOPR above 1, hinting at possible correction.\n\nA move south could see Ethereum price lose the immediate support at $2,874, potentially extending the fall to the $2,800 base, 5% below current levels. In a dire case, ETH could roll over to the confluence between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,689. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a reentry by the bulls could send Ethereum price further north, clearing the $2,944 range high and potentially extend the gains to the $3,000 psychological target, almost 3% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nRipple price eyes $0.6000\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains bullish despite the broader market showing weakness, an optimism inspired by hopes of a conclusion in the legal saga against the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWith RSI at 58 and leaning north, Ripple price could increase amid rising momentum and the fact that there is still more room north before ETH is overbought.\n\nEnhanced activity among the bulls could see XRP price shatter the resistance due to the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel bringing the $0.6000 psychological level into focus. A tag of this milestone would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, a rejection from the channel\u2019s upper boundary could send Ripple price south, first losing support due to the $0.5368 buyer congestion level. An extended fall could see Ripple price test the midline of the channel at $0.5145, or in a dire case, slip to the support floor at $0.4734, 15% below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price steadies above $0.56 ahead of deadline in SEC v.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGaming tokens have spiked in recent days, but not all of them have been able to sustain the upswing. Case in point: MAVIA, the recently launched token of mobile strategy game Heroes of Mavia, has plunged sharply over the last two days, even after setting a new all-time high price.\n\nMAVIA is down over 5% on the day to a price of about $8.00, according to data from CoinGecko, and the latest drop has accelerated a total 24% dip since the Ethereum token popped to a new peak price of $10.59 on Sunday.\n\nHeroes of Mavia is an iOS and Android base-building strategy game similar to the smash hit Clash of Clans, albeit with planned crypto elements that have yet to be integrated. Skrice Studios\u2019 game will implement the MAVIA token for certain benefits, along with NFT land plots sold long before the game\u2019s January debut.\n\nMAVIA\u2019s latest spike came amid a broader surge for gaming tokens, with those tied to the Xai (XAI) and Beam (BEAM) gaming networks also setting all-time high prices, along with NFT trading card game Parallel (PRIME)\u2014GG\u2019s pick for the 2023 game of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upswing came just after Skrice revealed a detailed roadmap for the game, which includes implementing some of those aforementioned crypto elements in the game, adding other gameplay features, and rolling out an additional period of MAVIA staking rewards for NFT land owners. Heroes of Mavia will soon announce an as-yet-unrevealed Ethereum scaling network for implementing such crypto components.\n\nThe recent dip on MAVIA may reflect investors and airdrop recipients cashing in on the massive surge in token price. Even at the current subdued price, MAVIA has jumped 338% in value since debuting at $1.83 just two weeks ago. The token has seen just shy of $99 million in trading volume over the past day\u20148th most among gaming tokens, per CoinGecko.\n\nHeroes of Mavia targeted a sizable audience with its airdrop, offering a token claim to 100,000 early players alongside NFT land owners who had participated in previous staking campaigns. According to Skrice, the game has thus far racked up more than 2 million total downloads, with 278,000 daily active users as of Saturday.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "ETH ETF : Ethereum ETF Date Released? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Rumors are taking over the crypto community for the Ethereum ETF release date. It\u2019s speculated that Ethereum ETF approval might happen in March. ETH ETF has become the next target of investors all because of Bitcoin ETF\u2019s success, and people can\u2019t wait to see the same success for ETH ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETF had a positive price prediction and gained $10 Billion in AUM (Assets Under Management) within a month. It\u2019s exciting to see how Ethereum ETF will perform. So, what\u2019s the expected Ethereum ETF date? Let\u2019s find that out in this blog.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s Ethereum ETF?\n\nEthereum ETF is a product created to track the Ethereum price , facilitating the buying and selling of Ethereum on various exchanges. It is a convenient way to become a part of the crypto market without directly managing the assets.\n\nETH ETF mirrors the behavior of Ethereum in the market and offers exposure to its value without complexities. It is operated under the regulatory framework of the crypto market, allowing the regulated and secure channel for investors to invest in crypto. Ethereum ETF has regulatory advantages and offers security and liquidity, perfect for beginners or people who don\u2019t want to manage digital assets.\n\nIn general, an ETF is a large pool of money replicating the price growth of the assets it is tracking. There are 1000s of these ETFs that come from different companies, but most are chasing to replicate the price growth of the same thing. You give up your assets and get protection, efficiency, and simplicity.\n\nEthereum ETF Might Happen In March?\n\nWith the increased hopes from Ethereum ETF, everyone is presenting their views for a possible date. Some have predicted that it might get approved by March, and some have expected the May month. There\u2019s still no certainty when it might happen because it took 10 ten years for the Bitcoin ETF to get approved.\n\nThe delays seem to be because of the SEC\u2019s uncertain take on Ethereum being a commodity or Security. ETH ETF approval chances are comparatively lower than Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe SEC has stated multiple times that Bitcoin is a commodity, not a security. This kind of clarification never came forward in the case of Ethereum. The SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, has given vague answers on Ethereum\u2019s status as Security.\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that Ethereum ETF will happen, probably after a few months. World leaders like Ben Weiss, CEO of CoinFlip, and Ryan Lee, the chief analyst of Bitgetrt Research, have speculated the spot ETH ETFs are high.\n\nCompanies like Blackrock and Grayscale have already applied for Spot ETH ETF. Blackrock, the asset management company, has applied for Spot Ethereum ETF together with the Bitcoin ETF. They officially filed with Nasdaq to get their ETH spot ETF.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s SEC ETF history reveals that the SEC has approved the majority of its filled Spot ETFs. The company\u2019s approval record is 575-1. It is one of the factors the Ethereum community is considering in ETH ETF approval.\n\nDespite Ethereum ETF being on hold, the price of Ethereum is rising. Ethereum is continuously bullish through this month and is currently trading at $2932.55 with a trading volume of $15,638,161,033.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin ETF\u2019s successful launch has increased the expectations for the ETH ETF, and people are patiently waiting for the SEC\u2019s approval. The Ethereum ETF date is not out but it might happen in May. In addition, the majority of investors and analysts have indicated that this will happen before 2024 ends.\n\nEzra Icy Ezra Icy, the creative wizard from Phoenix, Arizona, specializes in crafting magnetic content for Web3 brands.

        "content": "The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has decided to test the waters with the launch of its latest NFT (non-fungible token) collection. This NFT collection, known as the \u2018SHEboshis\u2019, is different from the norm as it incorporates the ERC-404 token standard.\n\nShiba Inu Exploring New Horizons With ERC-404\n\nShiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya mentioned in a blog post how the team was choosing to venture into the \u201cunchartered territories of the ERC-404 standard\u201d with the Sheboshi launch. This adventure is no doubt an exciting one for the team, as the developer noted that they were filled with anticipation for the ERC-404\u2019s \u201cuntapped potential.\u201d\n\nThis new Ethereum token standard is currently one of the leading narratives in the Ethereum ecosystem and the crypto market in general. ERC-404 is a combination of the ERC-721 (for NFTs) and ERC-20 (for fungible tokens) token standards, a move which makes NFTs more liquid and further promotes fractionalization.\n\nThe Shiba Inu team had mentioned upon the launch of the SHEboshis on February 20 that the NFTs were going to be minted on the Ethereum network (as against Shibarium). They explained that they were \u201cleveraging the immense liquidity of Ethereum to give SHEboshis the start it deserves.\u201d In the long run, the team, however, plans to bridge these NFTs (alongside Shiboshis) to Shibarium.\n\nMeanwhile, Dhairya also revealed that a bug momentarily allowed for additional minting, with some wallets acquiring more NFTs than their initial allocation. He then went on to apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused to those who were unable to mint a SHEboshi.\n\nTo compensate for this occurrence, the developer mentioned that the team has increased the total SHEboshis from 12,000 to 20,000. Therefore, those who were unable to claim and mint their NFT can now do so. After the claim period ends, the unclaimed SHEboshis will be made available to LEASH holders to purchase.\n\nSHIB price starts recovery trend | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAllocation Of Proceeds From The Unexpected Sales\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, Dhairya also revealed how the team intends to allocate proceeds from the unexpected sales that occurred as a result of the earlier-mentioned bug. That event apparently raked in 652 ETH for the team. 50% of this revenue will be dedicated to token burns, charity donations, the team, and liquidity provision to the NFT project.\n\nFor the token burns, the team will \u201cstrategically\u201d burn SHIB, LEASH, TREAT, and SHI in order to reduce its supply and add value for the token holders. For donations, Dhairya mentioned that contributions will be made to support efforts in Japan (The Noto earthquake). Non-profits like the Manny Pacquiao Foundation and Women in Blockchain will also receive a share of the revenue.\n\n\u201cThis portion is allocated towards operational expenses and our treasury, furthering our mission towards a decentralized future as outlined in the Shib Paper,\u201d Dhairya remarked concerning the remaining 50% of the revenue.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News Flash, chart from Tradingview.com"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume has signaled a significant shift in its product offerings. Effective Feb. 28, 2024, at 6:00 p.m. (UTC), Binance will suspend trading and subscription services for leveraged tokens, with a subsequent end to redemption services and the eventual delisting of these products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move affects popular trading pairs including BNBUP/USDT, BNBDOWN/USDT, ETHUP/USDT, ETHDOWN/USDT, BTCUP/USDT and BTCDOWN/USDT.\n\nLeveraged tokens have been a niche offering on the platform, allowing traders to gain leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets without the complexities of managing a margin account.\n\nThe leveraged tokens to be delisted include two BNB pairs, two ETH pairs and two Bitcoin pairs. These tokens represent a basket of perpetual contract positions, designed primarily for short-term trading strategies. They are distinctive in that they automatically rebalance on a daily basis, differentiating them from traditional margin leveraged products. For a more detailed understanding, Binance has provided additional information on its blog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe schedule for the cessation of services is as follows: trading and subscription services for all affected leveraged tokens will be suspended on February 28, 2024, at 6:00 p.m. (UTC).\n\nFollowing this date, automatic cancellation of all existing trade orders for these tokens will occur.\n\nUsers are encouraged to trade or redeem these tokens before the suspension. After the cessation date, redemption can still be carried out via the wallet interface or the dedicated Leveraged Tokens page until the moment of delisting.\n\nSubsequent to the delisting, any remaining leveraged tokens will be converted to USDT based on the net asset value (NAV) at the time of delisting. This USDT will be credited to users' accounts within a 24-hour window."

        "content": "The supply held by non-exchange whale addresses increased significantly in February.\n\nThe accumulation frenzy could be because of the rapidly rising MVRV Ratio.\n\nEthereum [ETH] broke past $2,900 in the last few hours of trading as positive momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency persisted over the weekend.\n\nThe digital asset was trading at $2,907 at press time, up 3.65% in the last 24 hours, and over 16% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant data, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio bounced above 1, indicating that buying pressure for ETH was stronger than selling pressure at press time.\n\nThe next target for the ETH bulls was the psychologically important $3,000 level. Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange BuyUcoin, told AMBCrypto,\n\n\u201cAn important level for Ethereum to breach is $3,000, after which we can see a potential rally in the prices of altcoins.\u201d\n\nWhales are making the right moves!\n\nAmidst the surge, the behavior of a particular whale investor caught the attention of the market.\n\nThe wealthy holder grabbed a whopping 21,353 ETH worth $60 million just before prices rose, data from Lookonchain revealed. They did so by swapping Tether [USDT] tokens for ETH on Binance [BNB].\n\nAfter some time, the whale withdrew 10,649 ETH, amounting to a little over $30 million, in a separate transaction.\n\nIn fact, the whale has been on an accumulation spree since the 8th of February, having amassed around 52,759 ETH coins as of this writing. The ensuing rally helped the investor make $100 million in profits.\n\nThis was not an isolated case. Ethereum whales in general have shown urgency in accumulating coins at every given opportunity, evidenced by a jump in transactions worth more than $1 million.\n\nMoreover, the supply held by top non-exchange addresses has increased by 2 million since the start of February.\n\nThe lure of higher returns\n\nA big reason behind the accumulation frenzy could be because of the rapidly rising 30-day MVRV Ratio.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment data, ETH\u2019s prevailing price was 16.43% higher than the average acquisition price.\n\nConsidering that ETH was still a good distance away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, the buying spree might continue."

They represent a basket of perpetual contract positions and allow users to gain leveraged exposure to particular digital assets without complying with margin requirements.\n\nThese tokens, in general, were also very controversial back in the days following their introduction in 2020. There were many traders who failed to understand their exact structure and subsequently lost money because of it.

        "content": "Tue 20 Feb 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nRecently, Ether (ETH), the native crypto of Ethereum, has seen notable momentum. The asset is currently flirting with the $3,000 mark. This has sparked hope among crypto enthusiasts about the continuation of this trend with a positive effect on altcoins. A question that clearly divides analysts and experts.\n\nThe Hope of an Altcoin Season Driven by Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH)\n\nThe recent surge in the price of Ether (ETH), which has flirted with the $3,000 mark, has sparked hope for an impending \u201caltseason\u201d within the crypto community. However, analysts remain divided on the issue. On February 19, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto reached an intraday high of $2,980. That\u2019s its highest level in 22 months. Many enthusiasts believe this could herald the start of an ETH bull market and, consequently, an altcoin rally.\n\nHenrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, highlighted several fundamental factors underpinning this sentiment. Among these are the upcoming updates to Ethereum and the mainnet launches for scaling solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin over the past year suggests a potential catch-up. Especially given its deflationary nature following the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS).\n\nYuga Cohler, Senior Director of Engineering at Coinbase, echoed similar sentiments. He notably highlights the correlation between an ETH bull market and positive outcomes for altcoins. Meanwhile, voices like that of Mikybull Crypto forecast a bullish March for the native asset of Ethereum blockchain, with $3,000 as a plausible target. He anticipates a significant increase in altcoin activity.\n\nHopefuls call for \u2018#altseason\u2019 led by #Ethererum rally, analysts not so sure https://t.co/LUxw2uzJVz \u2014 MrMr4Nk \ud83d\udc99 De.Fi Army (@MrCr4nk) February 20, 2024 While enthusiasts anticipate an altcoin season driven by Ether, some analysts remain skeptical\n\nDissenting Voices Regarding This Outlook\n\nHowever, Markus Thielen, Head of 10x Research, holds an opposing view. According to him, there is a lack of substantial evidence for the eventuality of an impending altcoin season. He points out that sustainable reductions in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance below 45% are required to foster a viable altcoin rally.\n\nThe crypto expert also notes that unlike previous increases observed during the ICO and DeFi summer bull markets, the current rise lacks a clear explanation. Save for the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, the recent altcoin rallies have quickly dissipated, suggesting a higher risk-adjusted potential in favor of investments in BTC.\n\nMarkus Thielen\u2019s analysis also questions the sustainability of Ethereum\u2019s momentum. He believes it could be more motivated by the anticipation of the ETF approvals in May than by an increase in on-chain activity within decentralized applications (dApps). For the analyst, the current bull market will persist until 2025, a period during which altcoins may experience sporadic recoveries.\n\nSupporting Markus Thielen\u2019s cautious outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment cautions against overbought signals on the market. As indicated by the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, it suggests above-average risk associated with buying or opening new positions during the current surge. This is while most crypto projects have generated medium and long-term profits since October 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has expressed anticipation for the upcoming Verkle Trees, highlighting their potential to be a game-changer for staking nodes. Vitalik said that he wants to see the full implementation of Verkle trees.\n\n\u201cThey will enable stateless validator clients, which can allow staking nodes to run with near-zero hard disk space and sync nearly instantly \u2013 far better solo staking UX,\u201d he noted in a tweet. He added that it will make it easier for user-facing light clients.\n\nVerkle Trees are a type of data structure that can be used to efficiently and securely prove the inclusion of a particular value in a set of data.\n\nThey are similar to Merkle Trees, another popular data structure used in blockchain, but with some important differences.\n\nThis allows clients to verify state changes in each block with minimal data. Verkle Trees is a critical step on the path to stateless Ethereum clients, who do not have to store the entire state data to validate incoming blocks.\n\nInstead of using their own local copy of Ethereum\u2019s state to verify blocks, stateless clients use a \u201cwitness\u201d to the state data that arrives with the block. A witness is a collection of individual pieces of the state data required to execute a particular set of transactions.\n\nVerkle Trees enable significantly reduced proof sizes for a large amount of data compared to Merkle Trees, making them an important tool for smart contract developers and other blockchain professionals.\n\nVerkle Trees bring several other advantages to Ethereum, including smaller proof sizes for efficient network communication, reduced hardware requirements enhancing decentralization, faster node synchronization for quicker onboarding, potential scalability benefits with higher gas limits, and compatibility with Ethereum\u2019s evolution towards a zk-EVM future, ensuring adaptability.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum validators need fully synced nodes containing all state data for chain validation.\n\nVerkle Trees, part of an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), introduces self-contained execution units within blocks.\n\nThis innovation allows blocks to be verified without additional information, such as the complete state of the chain.\n\nWhile Verkle Trees are currently in the testnet phase, their anticipated launch on the mainnet is set for 2024."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the rising DeFi market, newcomers are finding themselves in the spotlight. KangaMoon (KANG) is one of those newcomers. Some analysts have even hinted that this meme coin, which will soon enter its presale, could surge by 35x in 2024. But how does this rookie compare to already-established cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nKangaMoon (KANG): A Potential Star in the Memecoin Sector\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) is a community-driven meme coin that everyone has been talking about. It is making a splash with its unique approach of combining memes and cryptocurrency. By focusing on building a solid community and introducing play-to-earn elements, KangaMoon is looking to be one of the top meme coin out there.\n\nKangaMoon could accomplish this as it will introduce a P2E game in which KANG is the main currency used for everything. With KANG, players can purchase in-game items, upgrade their characters, and more.\n\nKangaMoon will also incorporate a marketplace where you can sell or trade any in-game collectibles you have gained. Therefore, any player can make money from their time in the game.\n\nCurrently, the DeFi project is preparing to enter its presale. During this time, you can buy the KANG token for a discounted price of only $0.0075.\n\nHowever, since it will enter the $176B gaming market, experts are bullish about this meme coin. They forecast a potential 350% price pump once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in 2024.\n\nAnalyst Elja With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nRecently, crypto analyst Elja made a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction. According to his new tweet, Ethereum may hit $15,000 by 2025. He states that this explosive move will come as whales accumulate this altcoin.\n\nOver the last week, the Ethereum price has been bouncing between $2,402 and $2,272. In that same time period, its market cap moved between $288B and $272B. However, 20 technical indicators are in the green for this altcoin. Due to all these reasons, market analysts predict that Ethereum will hit $2,400 before the end of February 2024.\n\nRekt Capital\u2019s New Bitcoin Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also been making headlines. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that a new Candle 4 has formed for Bitcoin at the $39,357 level. He predicts that this Candle will be broken after the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has jumped from $40,790 to $42,261 over the past week alone. During that time, its market cap has also increased from $799B to $825B. Furthermore, this DeFi coin now trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Because of this, experts in the field foresee a Bitcoin price of within Q2 of 2024.\n\nWill KangaMoon Outpace Ethereum and Bitcoin?\n\nSince it is so early in its development, KangaMoon has gained a competitive edge over Ethereum and Bitcoin. To clarify, KangaMoon now has a market cap of $5M. Because of this, KANG would need less money to raise its price. This puts it in a good position to become the next top memecoin in 2024.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\n*This article was paid for.

Cowen advises caution in trying to anticipate these shifts, reflecting on the unpredictability of central bank actions and their impact on asset values.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Is ETH In the Cycle?\n\nCowen takes a deep dive into where Ethereum stands in its market cycle, comparing it to Bitcoin\u2019s past rallies. He points out that Ethereum\u2019s performance isn\u2019t set in stone; it sways with the broader economy, including changes in interest rates and whether the financial world is loosening or tightening the purse strings.\n\nHe zeros in on how the overall flow of money in the economy, or net liquidity, can affect how investments do. Cowen hints that in some economic conditions, riskier bets like Ethereum could start to shine brighter than their safer counterparts.\n\nHowever, he remains cautious, keeping his portfolio Bitcoin-heavy due to its dominance and his scepticism about Ethereum\u2019s immediate prospects."

        "title": "India's First Crypto-Billionaire: The Visionary Behind Ethereum's Scalability - YourStory",
        "content": "In the digital age, where innovation and determination intersect, Jaynti Kanani's journey emerges as a beacon of inspiration. From the outskirts of Ahmedabad, where he grew up in modest circumstances, to scaling the heights of the cryptocurrency world, Kanani's story is a testament to the transformative power of technology and vision.\n\nEarly Life and Education: The Foundation of a Visionary\n\nBorn to a family with a modest income, where his father worked in a diamond factory, Kanani was instilled with the value of education early on. Pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, he laid the groundwork for his future in the tech realm, navigating through various roles that eventually led him to the discovery of blockchain technology. This fascination was the seed for Polygon, a groundbreaking solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges.\n\nPolygon: Revolutionising Blockchain\n\nIn 2017, Kanani, alongside Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, founded Polygon (initially known as Matic). Their mission was clear: to address the high fees and slow transactions plaguing Ethereum. By creating a scalability platform that supported faster, cost-effective applications while remaining on the Ethereum network, Polygon became a pivotal player in the blockchain ecosystem. The platform's native token, Matic, saw its valuation surge, propelling Kanani and his co-founders into the ranks of billionaires.\n\nA Financial Odyssey: From 6000INR to Billions\n\nKanani's net worth, primarily built through Polygon, underscores the vast potential within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. His transition from earning a modest salary to becoming a crypto-billionaire exemplifies the lucrative opportunities available in the space. Strategic investments, including a significant stake in Polysynth, have further solidified his position as a leading figure in the crypto revolution.\n\nBeyond Blockchain: The Personal Side of a Tech Innovator\n\nDespite his monumental professional achievements, Kanani maintains a low profile regarding his personal life. Known as a family man, his story reflects not only his technical prowess but also his values and commitment to his loved ones.\n\nThe Future and Legacy\n\nIn late 2023. After six years of relentless dedication and achieving remarkable milestones, Kanani decided to step back from the day-to-day operations, seeking to explore new adventures while still supporting Polygon from the sidelines. His decision was met with emotional responses from his co-founders, reflecting the deep bond and shared vision that drove Polygon's success. His focus on strategic investments and innovation promises a bright future for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nA Tale of Innovation, Resilience, and Transformation\n\nJaynti Kanani's ascent from a young man in Gujarat to India's first crypto-billionaire is more than a success story; it's a narrative of innovation, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of dreams. As Polygon scales new heights, Kanani's journey remains a source of inspiration, encouraging future generations to dream big and innovate without bounds."

        "content": "Commuter spots Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin at King Albert Park MRT Station\n\nWhen we think of places where we\u2019re mostly likely to spot a billionaire in Singapore, an MRT station might not be the first that comes to mind.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s precisely where one commuter spotted Vitalik Buterin, who is none other than the founder of the cryptocurrency network Ethereum.\n\nA post in the Singapore Incidents Facebook group claimed that Mr Buterin was seen waiting for a train at the King Albert Park MRT Station.\n\nHe was alone in the photo and seemed to be relaxing while using his phone.\n\nVitalik Buterin waits for train at King Albert Park MRT station\n\nOn Tuesday (20 Feb), Facebook user Mr Asan Kayo uploaded a photo of someone sitting on a bench at the King Albert Park MRT Station platform.\n\nHe told MS News that he first stumbled upon the photo of the man who resembles Mr Vitalik Buterin on the Singapore Stuff Facebook page.\n\nIn the image, the 30-year-old Russian-Canadian entrepreneur was dressed in a simple black T-shirt, shorts, and sneakers as he used his phone.\n\nIn other words, he looked like any other ordinary commuter.\n\nWhile it\u2019s likely that Mr Buterin was checking his emails or updates on the crypto market, one commenter quipped that he was checking how much he had spent on SimplyGo.\n\nAnother user asked why the OP didn\u2019t greet Mr Buterin or take the opportunity to ask when the Ether (ETH), Ethereum\u2019s main token, will soar in price.\n\nOthers admired how someone as wealthy as Mr Buterin was still willing to take public transport.\n\nAfter all, he could easily afford a fleet of fancy cars or call a cab.\n\nAs for possible reasons he was in town, The Straits Times (ST) once reported that Mr Buterin visits Singapore regularly as the Ethereum Foundation, of which he is a director, is based here.\n\nBecame the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaire at age 27\n\nAccording to Forbes, Mr Buterin became the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaire in May 2021 when the ETH crossed US$3,000 (S$4,038) per coin.\n\nHe was only 27 years old at that time.\n\nHowever, in a tweet on 20 May 2022, Mr Buterin clarified that he was \u201cnot a billionaire anymore\u201d.\n\nMany news outlets attributed this to the cryptocurrency market crash, which also affected the fortunes of many other prominent tech giants.\n\nHe definitely isn\u2019t broke, though \u2014 his estimated net worth still stands at around US$650 million (S$875 million), according to CryptoVantage.\n\nDespite his literal millions, Mr Buterin seems content to lead a simple and low-key life.\n\nIn a blog post from June 2022, he shared that he lives as a \u201cnomad\u201d and carries all his belongings in a 40-litre backpack.\n\nHe even name-dropped his favourite clothing brand, which is one that all Singaporeans would be familiar with.\n\n\u201cMy current strategy is to be a Uniqlo maximalist,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[A]ltogether, about 70% of the clothing items in my bag are from Uniqlo.\u201d\n\nWho knew we would have more in common with a tech billionaire \u2014 former or not \u2014 than we thought?\n\nAlso read: AXS Mobile App Users Can Pay Bills Using Cryptocurrencies Such As Bitcoin & Ethereum\n\nHave news you must share?
