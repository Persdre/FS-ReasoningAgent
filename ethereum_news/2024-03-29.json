        "title": "Litecoin Price Spikes After CFTC Calls It Commodity Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMeme coin lovers may be having a great month, but Litecoin (LTC) hodlers are celebrating today with their coin taking the spot as the second best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 100, with a bullish performance in the last 24 hours that saw its price spike nearly 11%.\n\nThis comes on the fifth day of relatively slow markets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum correcting by less than 2% in the same period. The global cryptocurrency market cap today sits at $2.79 trillion, marking a mere -0.1% change in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe most significant non-technical event contributing to Litecoin's spike is a recent statement by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In a lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, the CFTC declared Litecoin a commodity. This statement is crucial as it places Litecoin outside the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates securities and imposes stricter responsibilities on coin issuers.\n\n\u201cKuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC),\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeing declared a commodity potentially opens the door for more comfortable endorsements and further integrations for Litecoin, with less fear of the SEC attempting enforcement actions.\n\nLitecoin started the day at $94.80 and traded sideways until 6am UTC, when bulls took over the markets and spiked the coin to its daily high of $106 before correcting slightly to its current mark of $104.99. The coin is up 11.56% in the last 24 hours and 21.71% in the last week, plus 27.5% in the last 30 days. Friday marks the second best performing day of the year for LTC, only behind an 18.7% spike on March 11.\n\nOn the technical side, Litecoin was trading sideways during January and February, bouncing in a horizontal channel between $63 and $77. The coin broke its channel on February 29 and started a bullish trend on March 1. Most of the positive performance registered in 2024 has been due to March's positive results. Since the bottom of the channel to today's high, there has been a roughly 63% spike.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nPast data shows that many of the unusually large candlesticks are followed by a correction of many small-bodied candlesticks in the days after. Litecoin failed to break past the resistance set by March 11's spike, which could point to a possible cup-and-handle pattern: A big spike followed by a symmetrical period of a correction, and a recovery that cancels all the losses almost in a semi-circle shape. If this is the case, there should be a smaller correction followed by a similar recovery before a bullish breakout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, the coin looks bullish and healthy in a longer timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the coin is slightly overbought with a 66% dominance of bulls over bears, with Litecoin proving its bullishness after bouncing from its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 55 and going back again to trade on top of the EMA 10.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nGiven that the coin is bullish in charts set at 24 hour candlesticks and in weekly candlesticks for the first time since June of 2023, an immediate resistance could be around $115 for a 10% gain. If it remains strongly bullish, the next one appears to be near $135 for a nearly 29% gain. However, if it fails to meet expectations and corrects down, it could drop somewhere near the $80 price line for a -22.5% loss.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin talked about what the future holds for Ethereum.\n\nNetwork growth for ETH declined, indicating waning interest from holders.\n\nDespite the market volatility seen by the crypto markets, Ethereum[ETH] held on to its $3500 level. Vitalik Buterin\u2019s future plans for Ethereum could help add some momentum to ETH\u2019s price movement.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nVitalik addressed the recent state of Ethereum and the direction the network will be taking going forward. He stated that for a while now, people have known that Ethereum needs to get better at handling large number of transactions. One way to do this was through rollups.\n\nHe mentioned that the Ethereum team needs to make rollups better in four ways: making data smaller, using new ways to check data, fixing problems with how transactions are done, and making everything more secure.\n\nHe stated that Ethereum is on the right track with these changes. But Buterin also mentioned that future changes won\u2019t be as big as the ones that have been executed recently.\n\nTrouble ahead\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,519.87 and its price had fallen by 1.5% in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent positive price movement showcased by the ETH, the overall network growth plummeted for ETH.\n\nThis indicated that new addresses had lost interest in ETH at the time of writing.\n\nThe decline in network growth suggested that the new addresses were not willing to acquire ETH at current price levels and may be waiting for a correction before accumulating.\n\nAnother troubling indicator for ETH was the waning interest shown by whales. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the number of addresses holding 1-1000 ETH had fallen.\n\nIf whales continue to sell their holdings, it could prove to be detrimental to ETH\u2019s price.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nTechnical difficulties\n\nMoreover, the sentiment around Ethereum could be further impacted by recent developments around the network.\n\nThe Ethereum mainnet has recently encountered a disruption marked by the absence of blocks, sparking worries about the network\u2019s stability and functionality. As a result of this incident, Ethereum developers have initiated an investigation to delve into its root causes."

        "content": "According to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum would be much more expensive and time-consuming than Bitcoin\n\nShare this article\n\nConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask, has submitted a public comment letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), advocating for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The letter highlights the robust security features of Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, specifically addressing concerns about potential fraud and manipulation within the network.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s request for public comments , issued on March 8, seeks insights into whether Ethereum\u2019s PoS could present unique security challenges. ConsenSys responded with a comprehensive argument, asserting that Ethereum\u2019s PoS surpasses the security benchmarks established by Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW), which has already been the basis for approved Bitcoin-based ETFs.\n\nAccording to the firm, launching a successful attack on Ethereum is more expensive than attacking Bitcoin. Plus, an attack on Ethereum would also be much slower. Researchers estimate it could take nearly six months to gain control of the network, while an attack on Bitcoin potentially happens faster.\n\n\u201cThe total cost to attack on Ethereum would be nearly $34.39 billion (at December 2023 ether prices), and it would take nearly six months.20 The total cost to attack on Bitcoin, consisting mostly of the cost of computer hardware and electricity, would range from just under $5 billion to a little over $20 billion and could be waged more or less immediately. This makes Ethereum significantly more costly to attack than Bitcoin for the particular scenario addressed by the researchers,\u201d wrote ConsenSys.\n\nConsenSys additionally outlined several key advantages of Ethereum\u2019s PoS, including faster block finality, a distributed and randomized validation process, higher network attack costs, and slashing penalties for validators who breach protocol rules. These features, combined with Ethereum\u2019s environmental efficiency and transparent, decentralized community, provide a strong case for the network\u2019s resilience against fraud and manipulation.\n\nThe letter concludes with a call to the SEC to acknowledge the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed those of Bitcoin-based ETPs.\n\n\u201cThere is no justifiable reason to deny the listing and trading of the iShares Ethereum Trust based on concerns over ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation. We urge the Commission to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs previously approved by the Commission,\u201d stated ConsenSys.\n\nLast month, Coinbase sent a comment letter to the SEC in support of spot Ethereum ETFs . Coinbase\u2019s main claim in the letter is that Ethereum (ETH) is not a security and that Ethereum\u2019s PoS system effectively manages the network and mitigates risks. The firm also cited the recent approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs as a strong precedent for approving a similar product for Ethereum."

        "content": "The Ethereum network reached a milestone of one million validators Thursday, staking about 32 million Ether, worth an estimated US$114 billion.\n\nThis number accounts for roughly 26% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply.\n\nThe transition of the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake system in September 2022 has been instrumental in attracting this large number of validators, who are rewarded for their contributions to the network\u2019s security.\n\nLido, a leading staking pool, has emerged as a preferred platform, holding about 30% of all staked ETH and allowing individuals with smaller holdings to participate in staking.\n\nHowever, the growing validator count has sparked debate within the Ethereum community, with some expressing concerns over the possibility of over-staking and the potential rise in transaction failures.\n\nIn the regulatory area, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly been issuing subpoenas to entities associated with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAccording to Fortune, these legal actions are part of an investigation targeting the foundation\u2019s dealings, with a focus on the non-profit organization headquartered in Switzerland.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is known for its role in the development and governance of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSome firms reportedly received subpoenas shortly after Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake from the previous proof-of-work model.\n\nThe regulatory body\u2019s steps have sparked discussions around its potential implications for the classification of Ether as a security.\n\nThe regulatory authority has been postponing decisions on several applications for such Ether ETFs and is expected to make a decision on May 23.\n\nAccording to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, one of the Ether ETF applicants, such a financial product can be possible even if the digital asset is classified as a security."

        "content": "Despite having little to no purpose, some memecoins have valuations in the billions.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin suggested tying them to charity or finding other ways to tap taders' desire for fun and profit.\n\nEvery day, crypto traders swap billions of dollars of memecoins \u2014 defiantly useless tokens with tickers that often point to internet memes like Pepe the Frog.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks there\u2019s a better way.\n\nMemecoin creators should set aside a large chunk of tokens for charitable causes \u2014 or, better yet, create crypto-based video games designed to help low-income players, he said on his blog Friday.\n\n\u201cI have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1,\u201d he wrote, referencing a rash of offensive memecoins on the Solana blockchain.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I value people\u2019s desire to have fun, and I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\u201d\n\nMemecoin mania\n\nDogecoin is the original meme coin. It was made as a joke in 2015, poking fun at the speculative frenzy that often overtook the crypto economy.\n\nIt was not meant to be digital cash or digital gold, a la bitcoin. It did not represent governance rights in a digital cooperative, like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB. It had no built-in yield, no peg to some other stable asset.\n\nBut Dogecoin\u2019s market capitalisation surged to more than $88 billion during the 2021 bull market. And paved the way for other similarly silly, useless tokens.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLast year, PEPE took Ethereum by storm. This year, Dogwifhat surged on Solana. Both now have market capitalizations above $3 billion.\n\nMost have no intrinsic value, and their values are determined entirely by hype and an investors\u2019 gain (or loss) by the timing of his or her exit.\n\nMemecoins have accounted for roughly 5% of Ethereum transaction fees over the past month, according to data gathered by data analyst James Tolan.\n\nAnd they have made up a similar percent of trade volume on Ethereum\u2019s decentralised exchanges, according to SixDegree Lab.\n\nOn Thursday, meme coin trade volume topped $113 million on Ethereum.\n\nPositive-sum tokens\n\n\u201cIf people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version of this whole concept?\u201d Buterin said.\n\nHis first idea is rather straightforward: some percent of a newly-issued memecoin, or the transaction fees it generates, should be set aside for charity.\n\nAccording to Buterin, the most successful example of this might be Dogelon Mars, an Elon Musk-themed token.\n\nIn 2021, he transferred $145 million worth of Dogelon to the Methuselah Foundation, a space travel and anti-aging nonprofit dedicated to \u201cmaking 90 the new 50,\u201d according to its website.\n\nIt was 43% of Dogelon\u2019s circulating supply, spurring panic among other investors, who feared a fire sale that would destroy the token\u2019s value. But the nonprofit promised to be a good steward of the token.\n\n\u201cWe will take the same nurturing approach with our Dogelon Mars holdings because we understand that the cryptocurrency\u2019s value depends on maintaining the public\u2019s confidence and capturing its imagination, much like baseball cards or other collectibles,\u201d David Gobel, the foundation\u2019s co-founder and CEO said in a statement at the time.\n\n\u201cWe want the $ELON to keep accruing value over the long term.\u201d\n\nLater that year, Dogelon holders voted to fund a Methuselah-led experiment.\n\n\u201cThe community has donated funds to send prize-winning vascular tissue science to the International Space Station (ISS), where experiments can continue beyond Earth\u2019s gravity,\u201d the nonprofit said on its blog.\n\n\u201cThe ability to grow human organs will be important for crews who will eventually be involved in deep-space travel.\u201d\n\nWhile the token\u2019s value has cratered since the heady days of 2021, Vitalik believes the foundation has made good on its promise.\n\n\u201cThe two Methuselah Foundation and the Dogelon Mars community seemed to develop a positive-sum relationship with each other, retroactively converting $ELON into a charity coin,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nOther charity-related coins have been less successful.\n\nGiveWell Inu \u2014 named after a Shiba Inu, like most dog-themed memecoins \u2014 donated its proceeds to GiveWell, Buterin noted. But it\u2019s borderline defunct, with only one or two transfers a day, on average.\n\nVideogames\n\nButerin is more optimistic about the impact of crypto-based video games.\n\nWhile some have criticised the so-called play-to-earn model employed by crypto-based games such as Axie Infinity, Buterin hopes to see \u201cRobin Hood games\u201d \u2014 new crypto-based games designed to benefit low-income players.\n\n\u201cIf the goal is to satisfy people\u2019s desire to have fun, we should be making not simple copy-paste coins but rather more complicated and interesting games,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMoreover, \u201cgames that leave lower-income players in particular economically better off are more likely to leave their communities better than they came in.\u201d\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has praised Worldcoin\u2019s effort to enhance data privacy amid recent global regulatory challenges.\n\nIn a March 29 post on social media platform X, Buterin acknowledged Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to addressing privacy concerns by significantly reducing the data required in its system.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201c[Worldcoin] actually has been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing.\u201d\n\nNotably, Buterin was one of the earliest critics of the project when it launched last year. At the time, the Ethereum co-founder identified several flaws with the project\u2019s design, including the risk of data leaks and the collection of sensitive information such as gender, ethnicity, and health conditions.\n\nSince then, the Sam Altman-related project has faced several privacy-related controversies in various jurisdictions. Recently, regulatory authorities in Portugal and Spain imposed a temporary ban on Worldcoin\u2019s data collection activities for three months due to concerns over inadequate disclosure and unauthorized data collection from minors.\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s transparency and security\n\nAlex Blania, Worldcoin\u2019s co-founder, revealed that the crypto project has made significant strides in the transparency and security of its technology.\n\nBlania, in a March 28 post on X, detailed how the firm has made its ORB technology\u2019s core software components open-source while introducing new features that give people control over how their data is used.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cAdditional steps have been taken to ensure only individuals over the age of 18 are able to verify at an Orb. This includes redundant age confirmations in the app, verbal confirmation from Operators, and signage at locations. More technical solutions will follow.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Blania pointed out Worldcoin\u2019s commitment to collaborating with regulators to drive advancements across its operations. He remarked:\n\n\u201cWorldcoin is already the most private, open, and secure system of its kind and has never been more important.\u201d\n\nThese developments have translated into an increasing user base for the project, as nearly 5 million people across 120 countries have registered on its platform.\n\nMentioned in this article"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nConsensys, a prominent player in the blockchain and Web3 software space, has submitted a compelling argument to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), urging it to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design and grant approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsensys' argument for Ethereum ETF approval\n\nIn their comment letter to the SEC, Consensys addresses concerns raised by the Commission regarding Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and the potential for fraud and manipulation.\n\nIn Consensys\u2019 response to the regulatory body, it maintains that the SEC's scrutiny and concerns are \u201cwholly without merit\u201d given that Bitcoin-based ETFs have already been approved for trading by the SEC. They maintain that the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation mechanisms present in Ethereum's PoS are more robust and surpass the resilience of Bitcoin's PoW consensus model against tampering.\n\nThe comment letter highlighted key reasons the SEC should go ahead and grant approval. Consensys insisted that Ethereum's transition to PoS enables provable transaction finality, ensuring that blocks are irreversibly confirmed in a shorter time frame compared to PoW systems.\n\nIts PoS model involves segregated roles for block validators, which prevents concentrated control. This, it claims, mitigates the risk of manipulation and adds an extra layer of security. The other consideration about its classification was also addressed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who believes that an Ether-based spot ETF could still be launched even if Ethereum ends up being labeled a security.\n\nContrasting Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance with Bitcoin's\n\nThe Web3 software company says Ethereum's Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is higher than Bitcoin's. It asserts that Ethereum\u2019s mechanism of penalizing validators who violate protocol rules by slashing their stakes serves as a deterrent against malicious behavior. Additionally, Ethereum's PoS model is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than Bitcoin's PoW.\n\nConsensys makes a passionate appeal to the regulatory body ahead of the possible approval by stating, \u201cWe urge the SEC to recognize the advanced safeguards inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design, which not only meet but exceed the exemplary security and resilience safeguards underlying Bitcoin-based ETPs that have previously been approved by the SEC.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Ethereum ETF is being constantly delayed by the SEC, stakeholders anticipate a decision in the coming months. Regardless, Ethereum continues to gain traction as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a price of $3,502.43."

        "title": "Ethereum News: Navigating The Latest Developments In The Ethereum Ecosystem - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly evolving, with each day bringing fresh developments that promise to enhance its functionality, security, and scalability. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has always been at the forefront of blockchain innovation, especially with its transition to Ethereum 2.0, aimed at addressing some of the network\u2019s longstanding challenges. The latest Ethereum news encompasses a broad spectrum of updates, from technical upgrades to strategic partnerships, all of which are crucial for both developers and investors within the crypto community.\n\nTechnical Upgrades and Ethereum 2.0\n\nOne of the most anticipated pieces of Ethereum news is the progress of Ethereum 2.0, especially the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition is expected to drastically reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption, making Ethereum a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain. Furthermore, the introduction of sharding as part of Ethereum 2.0 aims to significantly enhance the network\u2019s scalability by splitting the database to spread the load, potentially solving the high gas fees and slow transaction times that have plagued the network during periods of high demand.\n\nStrategic Partnerships for Broader Adoption\n\nEthereum\u2019s roadmap is not solely focused on technical upgrades. Strategic partnerships play a vital role in its ecosystem expansion. Recent Ethereum news features collaborations with major companies and industries, aiming to integrate Ethereum\u2019s blockchain technology into various sectors such as finance, supply chain management, and entertainment. These partnerships not only validate Ethereum\u2019s utility beyond mere cryptocurrency transactions but also pave the way for broader adoption of its technology.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT Boom on Ethereum\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors have seen explosive growth on the Ethereum network. Ethereum news frequently covers the launch of innovative DeFi projects and platforms that offer a wide range of financial services without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Similarly, the NFT market has thrived on Ethereum, with artists, creators, and collectors engaging in the purchase, sale, and trading of digital assets verified on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. This boom has significantly increased Ethereum\u2019s visibility and utility, attracting even more developers and investors to its ecosystem.\n\nThe Impact on Ethereum\u2019s Price\n\nEthereum news often correlates with fluctuations in its price. Announcements related to upgrades, partnerships, or new project launches can have immediate effects on Ethereum\u2019s market value. Investors closely follow Ethereum news to gauge market sentiment and make informed decisions. With the ongoing developments in Ethereum 2.0 and increasing adoption in various sectors, many analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term price outlook.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, its community eagerly anticipates further news and updates that will shape its future. The transition to Ethereum 2.0, coupled with increasing adoption and innovative applications, positions Ethereum as a leading blockchain platform that could redefine how we think about digital transactions, contracts, and asset ownership. For developers, investors, and users alike, staying informed with the latest Ethereum news is essential for navigating the opportunities and challenges in the ever-changing landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum stands at the brink of significant transformation. Its commitment to innovation, sustainability, and broad adoption continues to drive interest and enthusiasm across the crypto space. As we look to the future, Ethereum\u2019s ongoing developments and strategic initiatives are set to further cement its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, promising a more efficient, secure, and accessible digital future."

        "title": "Why Major Cryptocurrencies Soared This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "From strong bitcoin ETF inflows to anticipation of next month's bitcoin halving event, major cryptocurrencies continued their multimonth run higher this week.\n\nSeveral major cryptocurrencies rallied this week amid multiple potential catalysts including strong net inflows into bitcoin ETFs, notable new registration filings for spot Ether ETFs, and an anticipated \"bitcoin halving\" event in early April.\n\nWhen all was said and done as of the close of Friday's regular session, the price of Bitcoin (BTC -2.01%) was up 9.7% on the week, while Ethereum (ETH -2.25%) had gained 5.1%. So-called memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE -6.36%) and Shiba Inu (SHIB -8.22%) also soared 41.2% and 16.5%, respectively, this week.\n\nOn Bitcoin ETF inflows, new spot ETH ETF filings\n\nThe price of Bitcoin eclipsed $71,000 several times this week -- a week after falling below $63,000 -- before settling to trade around $69,500 as of this writing. The world's most prominent cryptocurrency was bolstered in part by huge net inflows into bitcoin ETFs exceeding $243.4 million on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB 1.50%) singlehandedly registered net inflows of $200.7 million, becoming the third bitcoin ETF to cross the $200 million mark since the the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 13 bitcoin ETFs back in January.\n\nBitcoin, for its part, has enjoyed an incredible rally dating back to October 2023, which came after months of speculation after the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's ruling in August preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nFor perspective, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the normal trading day through nearly any online brokerage -- as opposed to requiring investors to set up separate crypto trading accounts with a crypto-specific firm. So ETFs are a much more accessible medium for anyone who wants to put their money to work in cryptocurrencies. The SEC's approvals have stood out vote of confidence from a government agency in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment option.\n\nSome investors have also speculated more recently that Etherium ETF approvals could be on the way in the coming months, further bolstering crypto investment options for retail traders. On Wednesday, Fidelity Investments filed a Form S-1 Registration statement for its own spot ETH ETF. Asset Management firm Bitwise followed suit with its own registration statement filing for a similar spot Ether ETF on Thursday.\n\nOn the bitcoin halving event\n\nMeanwhile, crypto investors are eagerly awaiting a so-called bitcoin halving event scheduled for mid-April -- the fourth such event in bitcoin's history, with previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020 -- where bitcoin miners' reward for solving complex transactions is effectively cut in half to limit the rate at which new bitcoin are introduced into the system until the maximum of 21 million bitcoins have been issued. Bitcoin's price has previously skyrocketed following each of the first three bitcoin halving events, so investors have naturally speculated a similar rally could occur next month.\n\nThe halving event is similar in some ways to a stock split, where a company may reduce its per-share price but commensurately increase the number of shares issued. Splits are a zero-sum event, of course, considering the value of the underlying business remains the same. But many retail investors tend to believe the lower post-split stock price is more attractive. Multiple cryptocurrency market pundits have argued that this halving event should further spur adoption of bitcoin while also limiting supply -- effectively keeping the price of bitcoin high.\n\n\"The halving reminds people that the supply of bitcoin is truly limited and that demand is increasing, driving up the price of bitcoin in the long term,\" Azteco Chief Marketing Officer David Bailey wrote this week. \"As something becomes more valuable, more people will want to use it, and so the cycle continues.\"\n\nThere are no guarantees, of course, that the price of bitcoin will rally on the heels of this halving in the near term. But it's hardly surprising to see crypto traders embracing the positivity leading up to the event."

Not even the recent Bitwise ETH ETF filing and correlation analysis has swayed the analyst\u2019s position.\n\nOn 28th March, Bitwise submitted a new 19b-4 form alongside a correlation analysis to satisfy SEC\u2019s criteria, as seen during the spot Bitcoin BTC ETF application.\n\nThe firm stated;\n\n\u201cThis is the first ETH correlation analysis to replicate the specific methodology used by the SEC in their evaluation of bitcoin, and the results are encouraging.\u201d\n\nGreat correlation, but ETH ETF odds are still low\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer of Variant Fund, hailed the correlation analysis;\n\n\u201cFantastic work from Bitwise here, showing an extraordinarily tight correlation between ETH spot and futures, using the SEC\u2019s methodology.\n\nChervinsky added that Bitwise analysis could make it hard for the SEC to deny ETH ETF based on correlation.\n\nBut Nate Geraci of ETF Stores took a swipe at SEC;\n\n\u201cSad we need an ETF issuer to run correlation analysis showing that govt agency approved futures contracts tightly track price of underlying asset\u2026 And a sister govt agency has approved ETFs holding said futures but won\u2019t approve ETFs holding underlying.\u201d\n\nIn rejoinder, however, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the developments don\u2019t improve approval odds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 7 weeks till the deadline, and radio silence from SEC = bleak\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Balchunas noted that if there is a rejection in May, the timeline might have to be re-adjusted to the US elections.\n\n\u201cElection next.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a \"positive-sum\" vision for meme coins, arguing that the current crop of meme-inspired cryptocurrencies do little more than \"go up and down in price and contribute nothing of value in their wake.\"\n\nIn a recent blog post, Buterin argued that \"many people feel uneasy\" about the current crop of meme coins, and outlined how the \"financialized games\" that underpin them can be made to support public goods and charities.\n\nHe took aim at a recent wave of \"openly super-racist\" meme coins on blockchains such as Solana, adding that, \"I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin seemed to be referring to a rash of blatantly racist tokens that appeared on exchanges last week, many that used the n-word, a token called \"Jews did 9/11,\" and \"NAZI,\" which appears on exchanges with a swastika as its trading symbol.\n\n\"One answer to this conundrum is to shake our heads and virtue-signal about how much we are utterly abhorred by and stand against this stupidity,\" Buterin said. A more productive step, he argued, is to create a \"more positive-sum version\" of the whole concept of meme coins.\n\nButerin envisions meme coins being more like GiveWell Inu (which is no longer active), which promised to donate a portion of its proceeds to the Give Well organization.\n\nBack in 2021, after Buterin had been gifted half the Shiba Inu (SHIB) supply he swapped them for Ethereum. After he'd done that, he sent $53 million worth of the ETH to Give Well. But the project seems to no longer be maintained.\n\nAnticipating that his ideas might steal the fun of degens who enjoy taking a gamble on new meme coins, he suggested that developers build better Web3 games. He specifically put the spotlight on the 0xPARC organization, which has been responsible for games Dark Forest and FrogCrypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I value people's desire to have fun,\" Buterin said, adding that, \"I would rather the crypto space somehow swim with this current rather than against it.\"\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves."

        "content": "Bitcoin has topped the non-fungible token (NFT) market in sales performance on Thursday, with a slight decrease of 0.06% in sales.\n\nThe blockchain registered US$11.89 million in sales, with a negligible change in its all-time sales volume, maintaining a steady market presence.\n\nJIGO BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin-based collection, led Thursday\u2019s NFT collection rankings with almost US$2 million.\n\nBitcoin now has US$2.989 billion in all-time NFT sales. The blockchain is on pace to close the trading week by joining the US$3 billion club.\n\nEthereum and Solana followed, ranking second and third respectively, but with more notable fluctuations in their sales figures.\n\nEthereum fell out of the top spot on Thursday after a sales decrease of 13.72% to US$10.16 million.\n\nSolana\u2019s 24.45% sales increase was not enough to overtake the slumping Ethereum, as it came in third with US$8.18 million.\n\nPolygon continued raising its daily total with US$1.5 million, the second consecutive day of at least US$1 million in sales.\n\nMythos Chain failed to follow Polygon\u2019s lead as it fell below the US$1 million mark it reached yesterday."

He pointed out that the team has shown dedication to minimizing data usage.\n\nIn his words:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIMO, they actually have been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal.\u201d\n\nIMO they actually have been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 29, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder issued this positive remark following a report that the CNPD, Portugal\u2019s data regulator, has ordered Worldcoin to halt biometric data collection for 90 days.\n\nThis move represents the latest regulatory setback for Worldcoin\u2019s iris-scanning project, which has faced privacy concerns in various countries.\n\nIn response to the development, X user Louis Anslow attempted to highlight the irony of the situation by mentioning that he had his privates scanned in Portugal in 2021 using a German orb.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn this premise, Vitalik Buterin commented that the Worldcoin team has been doing a great job managing the criticisms directed toward their iris-scanning project and data collection practices.

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nFollowing the SEC approval of some spot Bitcoin ETFs, many entities have also indicated interest in an ETH ETF. The Boston-based multinational financial company Fidelity Investments joined the race for approval to list a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWhile advancing its plans, the company has filed an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).\n\nFidelity Submits Its S-1 Form For A Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nAs the race for spot Ethereum ETFs intensifies, an X post from Radar revealed that the $4.5 trillion asset manager, Fidelity Investments, is the newest applicant for an ETH ETF approval.\n\nJUST IN: $4.5 trillion asset manager Fidelity filed for a Spot Ethereum ETF with staking included. US regulator SEC has been reluctant to approve Ethereum ETFs and is unlikely to change unless challenged in court. pic.twitter.com/bdQwCgm1Pf \u2014 Radar\ud83d\udea8 (@RadarHits) March 27, 2024\n\nRecently, Fidelity filed the S-1 form with the SEC, indicating its intention to issue a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe filing shows that Fidelity selected the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) as the market for trading the ETH ETF upon approval. However, it didn\u2019t specify the expected fees for the ETF or the ticker name under which it will trade.\n\nNotably, Fidelity is not the only company that has filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF. Other prominent entities like BlackRock, Grayscale, Valkyrie Digital Assets, Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree Investments are already in the race.\n\nThe quest for spot Ethereum ETFs started following the SEC\u2019s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nMost Bitcoin ETFs have recorded impressive performances in the weeks following the approval. According to Coinglass data, the BTC ETFs have amassed $57.9 billion in total AUM as of March 28.\n\nFidelity Includes ETH Staking In Its Application For Ethereum ETF\n\nFidelity Investment took its application further by including an ETH staking program. This means the asset manager proposes to stake a portion of its trust\u2019s assets using one or more staking infrastructure providers.\n\nA part of the application reads:\n\n\u201cAs a result of any staking activity in which the trust may engage, the trust expects to receive certain staking rewards of Ether, which may be treated for federal income tax purposes as income to the trust.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the filing indicated that the Fidelity Digital Asset Service, the fund custodian, will maintain complete control of the staked ether. It will always have exclusive possession and control of the private keys of the staked tokens.\n\nHowever, the possibility of getting spot Ethereum ETFs is relatively low. The SEC has reportedly opened investigations into several entities with a relationship with the Ethereum Foundation. The aim centers on classifying ETH as a security.\n\nMoreover, some industry experts believe the SEC will implement delay strategies similar to the approval process of spot BTC ETFs. According to Radar, the US SEC has delayed the Ethereum ETF approval and will likely remain adamant unless challenged.\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hougan thinks the SEC should delay its approval till December from the anticipated May dates. His argument revolves around establishing a better understanding of the spot BTC ETF within Wall Street before introducing that of ETH.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "If XRP captures Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) market cap, its price could skyrocket to a new all-time high of $7.42, representing an impressive 11.8x rise.\n\nDespite its unique legal clarity, XRP has not performed as expected during the current bull run. The concerns among market participants began in late July 2023 when XRP started correcting the gains it picked up following the pivotal July 13, 2023 ruling.\n\nNotably, by September 2023, XRP had already retraced all its gains, collapsing from the $0.93 high. Despite the broader market\u2019s uptrend, which started in October 2023, XRP has not recorded any substantial price run, trailing other notable altcoins, including Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a result, Ethereum, which XRP had aimed to overtake again as the second-largest crypto asset, has clinched a market capitalization far above XRP\u2019s. At the valuation of $406.64 billion, Ethereum\u2019s market cap has skyrocketed 119% from the $185.12 billion recorded last October.\n\nHowever, while XRP\u2019s market capitalization has also increased within this timeframe, its growth rate pales compared to Ethereum\u2019s. XRP currently boasts a valuation of $34.23 billion, marking a 32% increase from the $26 billion market cap in October 2023.\n\nXRP Price if It Captures Ethereum Market Cap\n\nDespite the underperformance, some market participants remain confident in XRP\u2019s potential. Interestingly, analysts have predicted that XRP will hit some lofty price positions. On March 19, top analyst EGRAG asserted that XRP could reach $27, citing historical data.\n\nIn addition, Reaper Financial CEO Patrick Riley revealed in an interview last December that he expects XRP to record a massive growth to $22. Amid these ambitious projections, we evaluated how much the XRP price needs to surge for the token to overtake Ethereum eventually.\n\nLeveraging an online resource, Marketcapof com, we discovered that XRP currently trades 0.08x under Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. As a result, XRP\u2019s valuation would need to increase by as much as 11.88x in order to reach Ethereum\u2019s market cap.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSupposing XRP\u2019s circulating supply remains relatively stable, XRP\u2019s price would need to rise to $7.42 for its market cap to reach the figure currently recorded by Ethereum.\n\nMarket watchers have previously forecasted XRP to hit the $7 price target. Prominent XRP influencer Ben Armstrong disclosed in January that believes XRP would certainly reach $7. Meanwhile, last month, analyst Ben McClymans set a $7 target for XRP during the bull run in 2025.\n\nFor XRP to reach the $7 target, its price would need to rally by 1,013% from the current figure of $0.6285. While this surge could face opposition at multiple junctures, analysts generally believe it is possible to attain."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have shown some volatility in the past 24 hours, both trading 1% lower than they were this time yesterday.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has been hovering around $70,000 after looking like it might rise above $71,000 yesterday evening. It's now 0.9% lower than it was this time Thursday. Ethereum has also seen its own dip, currently trading at $3,557, marking a 1% decrease.\n\nOn the flip side, Binance Coin (BNB) has experienced a notable increase and is trading for almost $614. That's a 4.6% increase since yesterday and 7.7% higher than it was last week.\n\nThere's no telling how much the two are linked, but BNB is rising just as there are signs the crypto exchange and its executives are finding ways to fight back against allegations leveled at it from the Nigerian government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a local news outlet, Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to compel the Office of the National Security Advisor (NSA) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to apologize to him over his detention in the country. He's also filed a lawsuit alleging his fundamental human rights have been violated.\n\nFor nearly a month, Nigerian government officials had detained Gambaryan alongside another Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla\u2014who managed to escape custody earlier this week.\n\nMeme-while, popular Solana meme coin Dogwifhat (WIF) has climbed another 17% since Thursday morning. It was only yesterday that WIF managed to flip PepeCoin (PEPE). Its $3.6 billion market capitalization makes it the 41st overall largest cryptocurrency. And in the meme category, it's now also much larger than Ethereum meme coin Floki Inu (FLOKI) and its Solana competitor Bonk (BONK).\n\nAnother top gainer in the last 24 hours has been the native token for the Celestia network, TIA. Celestia, a Layer-1 network, has recently gained some buzz for being a serious Ethereum competitor. Since yesterday, the TIA price has gained 9.2% and is currently trading for $15.15.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, the exchange rate between Ethereum (ETH) and the US dollar (USD) is a critical piece of information for traders, investors, and enthusiasts alike. Known as the ETH to USD conversion rate, this figure not only reflects the current market value of Ethereum but also serves as a key indicator of the cryptocurrency\u2019s health and investor sentiment. As Ethereum continues to solidify its position as a leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, understanding the ETH to USD rate is essential for navigating the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that the ETH to USD rate can fluctuate wildly within short periods. These fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including market demand, investor sentiment, technological advancements within the Ethereum network, and broader economic indicators. For investors, these fluctuations present both opportunities for significant gains and risks of considerable losses, making it crucial to stay informed and adopt a strategic approach to cryptocurrency investment.\n\nOne of the primary reasons investors monitor the ETH to USD conversion rate is to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding their Ethereum investments. For those looking to convert their ETH into USD, timing is everything. A high conversion rate means more dollars for each Ether sold, while a low rate can lead to losses if the investor purchased ETH when the dollar value was higher. Consequently, many investors engage in active market analysis, attempting to predict future movements in the ETH to USD rate based on current trends and news within the cryptocurrency and financial worlds.\n\nMoreover, the ETH to USD rate is not only important for individual investors but also plays a significant role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s value relative to the US dollar can impact the funding and viability of dApps and projects built on the Ethereum platform. A strong ETH to USD rate can encourage development and innovation within the ecosystem, while a weak rate may deter investment and development.\n\nGiven the importance of the ETH to USD conversion rate, several tools and platforms are available to help investors track and analyze these fluctuations. Cryptocurrency exchanges, financial news websites, and dedicated crypto analysis platforms offer real-time data and insights into the ETH to USD rate. Additionally, many of these services provide historical data, allowing investors to identify trends and patterns over time.\n\nTo navigate the volatility of the ETH to USD rate effectively, investors often employ a mix of strategies, including diversification, setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and staying updated on Ethereum network developments and global economic trends. Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, a long-term perspective and a tolerance for risk are also important traits for successful investors.\n\nIn conclusion, the ETH to USD conversion rate is a fundamental metric for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency market. Whether you\u2019re an experienced investor, a newcomer to the world of digital currencies, or a developer working on Ethereum-based projects, understanding and monitoring this exchange rate is key to making informed decisions. With careful analysis and strategic planning, investors can navigate the complexities of the ETH to USD rate and capitalize on the opportunities within the dynamic and exciting world of cryptocurrency."

As of press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.1% up at a crucial juncture of $3,510 with a market cap of 4421 billion.\n\nEthereum Whales Accumulating In Big Numbers\n\nIn recent insights shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, amidst the observed correction in Ethereum\u2019s price over the preceding weeks, there\u2019s a noteworthy surge in whale transactions involving ETH. This trend is viewed as a bullish indicator, hinting at potential upward movements in Ethereum\u2019s price in the foreseeable future.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts have been expecting the Ethereum price rally to continue to $4,000 and further to hit its all-time high of $5,000 by the year-end. On the other hand, there have been mixed opinions regarding the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF with big players like Bitwise staying optimistic about the SEC approval by mid-May 2024.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nEthereum initiated a downward correction, dipping below the $3,550 mark. After retesting the $3,450 support level, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s movement, bullish momentum emerged. The price formed a low near $3,459 before rebounding.\n\nA notable development occurred with a breach above the $3,520 resistance area. Bulls propelled the price above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the downward swing from the $3,680 peak to the $3,459 low. Additionally, the ETH price broke a crucial bearish trend line, marked by resistance at $3,540 on the ETH/USD hourly chart.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading above $3,520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Looking ahead, immediate resistance looms near the $3,600 level, with the first major obstacle residing at around $3,630. This level coincides with the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward move from the $3,680 peak to the $3,459 low.\n\nOn the upside, the next major resistance is at $3,680, crossing which will open the gates for a further rally to $4,000. On the downside, the first major support is at $3,480 dropping under which could open further gates at the $3,250 level.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: Consensys Urges SEC For ETH ETF Approval - CoinGape",
        "content": "The anticipation surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF has intensified as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delves into Ethereum\u2019s security status. Meanwhile, this move has dampened the market sentiment lately, with the market participants anticipating a delay in Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nNotably, amid concerns of a potential delay in approval, blockchain firm Consensys steps forward, urging the SEC to recognize Ethereum\u2019s advanced safeguards.\n\nadvertisement\n\nConsensys Advocates For Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nIn a bid to bolster the case for an Ethereum ETF, Consensys has submitted a comment letter to the SEC, emphasizing the robust security measures inherent in Ethereum\u2019s design. The letter, shared on Consensys, addresses the SEC\u2019s inquiry into Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and its susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.\n\nIn addition, Consensys contends that Ethereum\u2019s PoS implementation not only meets but exceeds the security standards established by Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model, which has already garnered SEC approval for related Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). Besides, the company highlights several key features of Ethereum\u2019s PoS model, including faster block finality, distributed validation processes, and slashing penalties for protocol violations.\n\nMeanwhile, the letter emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s resilience against attacks, citing research that demonstrates the significantly higher cost of compromising Ethereum\u2019s network compared to Bitcoin\u2019s. Furthermore, Consensys underscores the environmental benefits of Ethereum\u2019s PoS, which consumes substantially less energy than Bitcoin\u2019s PoW.\n\nAlso Read: Aptos Network Buzz, Activity Surge Reflects in 48% Price Surge\n\nDriving Progress in Regulatory Clarity\n\nConsensys\u2019 proactive stance in advocating for Ethereum ETF approval reflects its commitment to advancing the adoption of blockchain technology. By engaging in constructive dialogue with regulatory bodies like the SEC, Consensys aims to pave the way for broader accessibility to decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications.\n\nMeanwhile, as the SEC evaluates the comments provided by Consensys and other stakeholders, the outcome of the deliberations will impact the crypto market on a broader scale. In other words, the outcome will not only impact the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s market but also set precedents for future regulatory decisions in the crypto space.\n\nIn navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation, collaborative efforts between industry players and regulatory authorities are crucial to fostering innovation while ensuring investor protection. However, despite Consensys\u2019s push, the Ethereum price was down 1.84% and traded at $3,503.43 during writing.\n\nThe trading volume of the second-largest crypto also dropped 7.55% over the last 24 hours to $12.79 billion. Notably, the ETH price saw a high of $3,575.59 and a low of $3,475.73 in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Whale Dumps 140 Mln DOGE As Price Takes Bearish Turn, What\u2019s Next?\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Ethereum network, believes meme coins can become higher quality projects that contribute positively to the crypto ecosystem and the world around them, squashing the narrative that such tokens are useless, racist, and sexist.\n\nAccording to a new report titled \u201cWhat Else Could Meme Coins Be?,\u201d Buterin looks forward to seeing meme coin projects that support public goods instead of enriching insiders and creators. He urged creators to make games instead of just tokens.\n\nMeme Coins Can Be More\n\nThe Ethereum founder cited a report he wrote ten years ago and published on Bitcoin Magazine, which addressed the role cryptocurrencies could play in funding important public projects like cancer research and saving the environment. He explained at the time that society needed new ways to fund valuable large-scale projects other than markets and institutions, and issuing new coins could fill in the gaps.\n\nPeople who wanted to support cancer research could hold and trade AntiCancerCoin, while those passionate about saving the environment could use ClimateCoin. These assets would determine which projects get funded, creating long-lasting and positive tokens that are different from what meme coins have become today.\n\nButerin explained that people participate in meme coin projects because they feel they are democratic and open for anyone, they are fun, and the value of the tokens may increase. He suggested that the crypto community could use a large percentage of a meme coin\u2019s supply to support valuable public causes, but that could happen at the expense of the token\u2019s worth and democracy.\n\nSo, the remedy would be to create gaming projects that are democratic, meaningful, fun, and have the tendency to rise in value.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don\u2019t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain,\u201d the Ethereum founder stated.\n\nCreating Interesting Games\n\nFurthermore, the computer programmer insisted that if the goal of creating meme coins and related games is to satisfy people\u2019s desire to have fun, then developers should stop making simple copy-and-paste coins. He urged owners of these projects to make the games more complicated and interesting.\n\nUsing blockchain gaming platform Axie Infinity as an example, Buterin commended how well the entity had improved the quality of its projects since its boom in 2021."

        "content": "Fri 29 Mar 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nThe balance of validators on Ethereum has always been a major concern. The more validators there are, the more secure the blockchain becomes. However, an overabundance of validators can lead to issues such as failed transactions. Recently, this issue has been reignited within the crypto community. Here are the details!\n\nThe Million Validators on Ethereum: Security at Stake\n\nWhile October 2023 saw a decline in crypto enthusiasts\u2019 interest in becoming a \u2018validator\u2019 on Ethereum, this trend was short-lived. Apparently, the situation has changed: the number of validators on the blockchain has exploded.\n\nNr. of validator is issue (too many can ultimatively lead to failed transactions). But the max. effective staking amount (>32ETH) should mitigate that risk. \u2014 Gabriel Weide (@AlphapingG) March 27, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum network has just crossed a major milestone with one million validators now active, reports Cointelegraph. It\u2019s a significant milestone, demonstrating growing confidence in the blockchain. With 32 million ETH at stake, valued at over 114 billion dollars, securing the network has become a priority.\n\nThe tracking platform Dune Analytics reported this historic step on March 28th. The data shows that 26% of the total ETH supply is currently staked, providing a solid foundation for the network\u2019s security and resilience.\n\nStaking pools, particularly Ethereum Lido, are gaining in popularity. These platforms allow small ETH holders to participate in the staking process by pooling their resources, thereby reinforcing the decentralization of the blockchain.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in protecting the network against malicious activities such as double spending. By engaging in the proposal and validation of transactions, they contribute to the reliability and robustness of Ethereum.\n\nTo become a validator, a minimum stake of 32 ETH is required. In return for their commitment, validators receive a reward in the form of ETH, thus encouraging ongoing participation and maintaining the security of the network.\n\nToo Many Validators Kill Crypto Transactions!\n\nIn the world of Ethereum, security is an absolute priority. But with a million active validators, some experts are starting to worry. According to veteran investor Evan Van Ness, the current number of validators is already \u201ctoo high,\u201d a sentiment shared by stake pool manager Gabriel Weide, who fears \u201cmissed transactions,\u201d as stated in the tweet above.\n\nPeter Kim from Coinbase Wallet acknowledges that the impressive number of validators is partly due to the 32 ETH limit imposed. However, he suggests that changes may be on the horizon.\n\nVitalik Buterin Proposes Sanctions\n\nIn the race to decentralization, Ethereum visionary Vitalik Buterin has a new idea. On March 27th, he unveiled a plan to make the network fairer by penalizing validators based on their failure rates.\n\nAccording to his proposal, validators would face harsher penalties for repeated failures. Buterin hopes to reduce the advantage large ETH holders have over smaller ones.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time such an initiative has been advanced. In June 2023, researchers proposed capping the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE at 2,048 ETH, already sparking controversies within the crypto community.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US approved a host of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the beginning of January 2024, from well-known financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and more. In fact, a new Bitcoin spot ETF from Hashdex has also joined the ranks recently- they have converted a Bitcoin futures fund into the new spot ETF to trade under the ticker DEFI.\n\n\n\nFollowed by the historical success of these BTC funds, the asset management firm Bitwise has knocked at the SEC\u2019s door with an application for a spot Ethereum ETF on March 28, Thursday. It\u2019s to be noted that Bitwise joins the fray quite late indeed- there are several spot ETH ETF applications pending the SEC\u2019s approval already.\n\n\n\nThe institutions seeking approval to launch Ethereum spot ETFs include BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy, among others.\n\n\n\nAs for the performance of the Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC are leagues ahead of the rest, both having over $10 billion in AUM (assets under management) as of the end of March 2024. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, recently pointed out that of 11,338 funds from all over the world in their first 50 trading days, the list of the top 30 holds four of the US Bitcoin ETFs. Of course, the aforementioned IBIT and FBTC take the lead, holding the first and second spots, respectively.\n\n\n\nAfter its spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitwise has filed a Form S-1 registration statement for shares in the aforementioned Ethereum ETF; based upon a 19b-4 amendment filing with the regulator, Bitwise has plans to list the shares of its ETH spot ETF on NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) Arca.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the market speculates that the SEC may be looking to name ETH a security after its conversion into a proof-of-stake blockchain. This may complicate approvals for Ethereum spot ETFs in the US, delaying their arrival. Expert opinions are divided: while some believe the SEC will give a go ahead to the Ethereum instruments after all, most are expecting them to be hindered.\n\n\n\nAll eyes are now on the SEC, as their final deadline for the approval of three spot ETH ETF applications approaches in May.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have cooled down substantially since hitting $73,000 and $4,000, respectively, with a good number of holders taking solid profits. That makes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales flush with capital to throw around for the next bull run. One of the hottest investment opportunities that has been receiving major inflows is DeeStream (DST). DeeStream\u2019s presale is being tipped as the next 50x opportunity, and a good number of early adopters have been Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) whales. Here\u2019s why.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin (BTC) Cools Down as Investors Consolidate\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reached an all time high of $73,737 earlier this month; however, since then, a massive spate of sell offs ultimately cooled off the rally. Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $60,000 a couple of times since, but has bounced back pretty well each time it did. As of March 28th, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $70,766, still keeping a majority of holders in profit as the token enters a consolidation phase. Other Bitcoin (BTC) holders, meanwhile, are rotating profits into DeeStream (DST) to extract even bigger gains in the next bull cycle.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Follows Suit After Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nEthereum (ETH), trading at $3,552 as of March 28th, is up 2.38% as of press time from the last 7 days after bottoming out at $3,302.25. Nevertheless, Ethereum (ETH) has been in an uptrend over the past 2 weeks, trading at a small increase. Ethereum (ETH) has retraced in a major way since hitting $4,000 earlier this month. Just like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) traders are taking profits and reallocating them into DeeStream (DST).\n\nDeeStream (DST) Presale Stage 2 Debuts Amid Major Intrigue\n\nThe world is welcoming the first and only blockchain based streaming powerhouse looking to disrupt the live streaming industry with its unique decentralized approach to the format. DeeStream (DST) platform brings together streaming and blockchain technologies seamlessly, creating a streaming platform on par with the robust functionality and intuitive UX of YouTube and TikTok but without their centralization problems.\n\nThis completely decentralized Web3 platform uses blockchain to greatly improve the streaming experience. DeeStream (DST) creates an inclusive, secure, and community driven space that encourages communication between streamers and their audience creating a strictly better decentralized alternative to YouTube.\n\nIt is no surprise why Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are joining the DeeStream (DST) presale with tokens available at just $0.055. Crypto fans are eagerly buying in, eager to invest in this innovative platform. With over 16,500 registered users and over 3,100 presale investors (and counting), these numbers are likely to grow as DST continues to gain attention in the crypto market.\n\nMany investors are eager to participate in DeeStream\u2019s (DST) revenue sharing model. By holding DST tokens, investors receive a share of the platform\u2019s profits based on their holdings. Users and investors also receive daily rewards by completing various tasks.\n\nThe advantages of DeeStream (DST) are unparalleled in the crypto and streaming communities. Investors recognize the potential value of DST and even anticipate it becoming a top tier cryptocurrency. Users value DST for giving them more control while helping their streaming communities thrive.\n\nFind out more about DeeStream\u2019s (DST) presale by visiting the website here.\n\n*This article was paid for.

        "title": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Criticizes Ongoing Meme Coin Frenzy - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a gripping narrative shake-up, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently took to a post on X, showcasing a sense of immense dismay in meme coins. This post by one of the world\u2019s most prominent blockchain co-founders nabbed global attention, coming in the midst of a meme coin frenzy witnessed within the broader crypto market.\n\nWhile meme tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and WIF rallied remarkably over the past few days, the post shared by Vitalik contrasted market sentiments, spotlighting a plethora of reasons why meme coins reflect disdain despite their popularity. This stirred a whirlpool of speculations questioning the narrative of issuing coins as a novel approach to funding significant public endeavors, as Vitalik stated.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVitalik Disappointed in Meme Coins: Here\u2019s Why\n\nAligning with the post Vitalik shared on X, the idea behind \u2018issuing coins to fund public endeavors\u2019 was primarily to offer an alternative funding mechanism alongside markets and institutions, bridging gaps where traditional methods falter. To this, the co-founder added, imagine having an AntiCancerCoin to jack up cancer research or a ClimateCoin to support environmental causes. However, moving on to today\u2019s era, the crypto realm is dominated by memecoins.\n\nConcerning this, at the core, memecoins magnetize users due to their potential value increase, perceived inclusivity, and entertainment value. Nonetheless, diverting memecoins\u2019 supply towards supporting public endeavors remains frowned upon as it doesn\u2019t directly benefit users and may compromise value and inclusivity.\n\nThis collectively, among a few other reasons listed, is collectively attributed to Vitalik\u2019s dejection in memecoins, despite the phenomenal gains showcased amid the ongoing meme coin frenzy.\n\nAlso Read: Prisma Finance Hacker Moves Funds to Tornado Cash\n\nIs There A More Positive Approach?\n\nIn the same post, Vitalik drew attention to Charity coins and Robin Hood games, highlighting the potential benefits they offer compared to meme coins while also offering the same satisfaction. Concerning this, Vitalik spotlighted Robin Hood\u2019s potential of play-to-earn features like Axie Infinity to uplift low-income users financially.\n\nSimilarly, pointing out charity coins, the chronicle wherein a substantial portion of the coins\u2019 supply is donated to charitable causes conveys immense optimism not only for the crypto realm but also for the real world. Although these approaches may appear beneficial, there still remains grounds for more work to be done as they present their own challenges.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Gas Fees : Can You Really Get Ethereum Gas Fees Refund\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Ethereum whale cashes out 17,000 ETH \u2013 Here\u2019s what it means for you - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "An Ethereum whale that has been holding ETH for a long period of time sells its holdings.\n\nPrice of ETH remains unaffected, however, activity on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem poses concerns.\n\nAfter seeing a massive rally over the last week, the price of Ethereum[ETH] started to get stagnant around the $3500 price level. Due to this stagnancy, many holders decided to indulge in profit-taking.\n\nWhale takes profit\n\nAccording to recent data, an initial holder of ETH exchanged 17,770 ETH for 62.24 million DAI at a rate of $3,503 per ETH.\n\nThis individual amassed 14,280 ETH, valued at approximately $2.6 million, at an average price of only around $182, spanning purchases made from Gemini and Bittrex between March 2017 and April 2021.\n\nWith a staggering gain of 23 times their initial investment, the profit amounts to $59 million.\n\nThis whale\u2019s sale of 17,770 ETH injects a large amount of the currency into the market. This can cause downward pressure on the price in the short term, especially if there aren\u2019t enough buyers to absorb all the ETH being sold.\n\nHowever, the overall impact depends on market sentiment. If the sale triggers panic selling, the price could drop further. But, if the market views it as a healthy correction or the whale is simply taking profits, the price could stabilize or even rebound as others see a buying opportunity.\n\nETH remains resilient\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,571.59, marking a 27% difference from its all-time high. The price of ETH had tested the $3674.23 levels twice over the last few weeks.\n\nIf ETH manages to break past this level, it will put an end to the bearish trend that was observed after its price fell from $4081.55. ETH could also possibly head in the direction of the $4081.55 resistance yet again.\n\nHowever, the coin\u2019s CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) declined in the last few days, indicating that the money flow for ETH had fallen. This suggests that the price of ETH could see a period of sideways or downward movement before it starts to rally.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nState of the Ethereum network\n\nThe popularity of the Ethereum ecosystem will also aid ETH positively in the future. The gas usage on the Ethereum network remained consistent over the past month, suggesting a highly active ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the overall number of NFTs being traded on the network fell significantly over the last few days, indicating that the interest in NFTs on the Ethereum ecosystem fell. This could hurt the activity on the Ethereum network in the long run."
