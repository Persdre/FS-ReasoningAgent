        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission today said that it will need more than 45 days to evaluate a rule change that would allow Grayscale to convert its Ethereum trust into an Ethereum spot ETF. The new deadline is January 25, 2024.\n\nThe news comes as the regulatory body received notice from investing giant BlackRock that its pending Bitcoin spot ETF has already drawn $100,000 in seed funding from an undisclosed investor.\n\nFor Grayscale, the decision comes two weeks after the SEC delayed a separate request from the crypto asset manager to evaluate its proposal for an Ethereum futures ETF. That application was submitted in September.\n\nThe reason given in both cases was the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\" reads the SEC's official notice today.\n\nThat is, word for word, the same explanation the SEC provided last month.\n\nAs for BlackRock, its amended Form S-1 registration for its iShares Bitcoin Trust includes disclosure of a \"seed capital investor\" that's affiliated with BlackRock. The unnamed investor purchased 4,000 shares at a per-share price of $25 on October 27, for total proceeds of $100,000."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nThe year 2023 has marked a shift in the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Despite Ethereum\u2019s substantial dollar value growth of 88%, it has significantly underperformed compared to Bitcoin, being down by 25% against the lead digital asset. The ratio currently sits at a precarious 0.053, teetering near year-to-date lows.\n\nThis trend invites speculation as to whether the crypto landscape may soon witness a further dip in Ethereum\u2019s performance. The BTC-ETH Dominance metric, an oscillator that tracks the macro outperformance trends between Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides some relevant insights. It gauges the Bitcoin Market Cap\u2019s dominance over the combined market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum, normalized around a long-term mean using a 0.765 factor.\n\nHigher values and uptrends point towards Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum, while lower values and downtrends signal Ethereum\u2019s superior performance. Currently, we are technically in an era of Ethereum dominance, with the metric at -0.016, which is the lowest level since Ethereum dominance began in May 2021. Traditionally, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during bull markets, raising the question: Could this be the first bull market where Bitcoin outpaces Ethereum?"

        "content": "Ethereum price is on a tear, consolidating within a bullish technical formation that promises more gains if sustained.\n\nETH could rise 5% to convert the $2,300 resistance level into a support floor before continuing its upward trajectory.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated upon a daily candlestick close below the $2,143 support level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been consolidating within an ascending parallel channel since the broader market turned bullish around October 18, pushing north with key drivers including speculation of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launching in the market.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price breaks past $2,000 as BlackRock hints at filing for spot Ether ETF\n\nEthereum price eyes 5% rise above the $2,300 support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is trading with a bullish bias, sustained by an ascending parallel channel. This technical formation promises and delivers more gains for the asset as long as it remains within its confines. However, based on the current outlook, the largest cryptocurrency by trading volume looks ready for a breakout after one attempt already.\n\nTechnical indicators show that Ethereum price still has some upside potential, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) inclined north at 69 to show momentum is still rising. Its position below 70 is good, suggesting ETH is still not overbought nor ripe for a correction.\n\nSimilarly, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in positive territory with green histogram bars. This points to a strong presence of bulls in the Ether market and could bode well for Ethereum price, depending on how the bulls play their hands.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ethereum price breakout above the upper boundary of the chart pattern, confirmed by a flip of the $2,300 resistance level into a support level. This would set the tone for Ether to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics support Ethereum price bullish outlook\n\nMultiple on-chain metrics support the bullish thesis for Ethereum price, including the dwindling deposit transactions and the volume of exchange inflows. As a spike in deposit transactions would indicate a rise in short-term selling pressure, the absence thereof shows investors do not have the intention to sell.\n\nThis outlook is corroborated by dwindling exchange inflows, suggesting investors are not moving their ETH holdings to exchanges. There is no effective intention to sell in the near future.\n\nETH Santiment: Deposit transactions, exchange inflows\n\nFurther, the Tether (USDT) stablecoin market capitalization is rising, suggesting fresh capital inflow into the Ether market, interpreted as the intention to buy. The ensuing buying pressure could inspire a prolonged uptrend for Ethereum price.\n\nETH Santiment: USDT market capitalization\n\nConversely, if selling pressure increases, possibly as investors start booking early profits after such a striking climb, Ethereum price could pull south. In such a directional bias, ETH could lose the confluence support between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,143. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nFurther south, Ethereum price could extend the fall, potentially going as low as the $2,029 support before a foray into the supply zone turned bullish breaker. A decisive candlestick close below the midline of this zone at $1,935 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend."

        "content": "BTC crossed $42,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid rising market optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF would receive approval.\n\nBitcoin and ether once rose and fell in near lockstep, but no more.\n\nThough the prices of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value have both climbed in 2023, they have taken somewhat different paths, with BTC skyrocketing 145% year-to-date and ether jumping a still strong but lesser 85%.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin cracked the $42,000 threshold for the first time since early April 2022 when the Terra ecosystem started to collapse, while ether rose above $2,200 for the first time since May 2022, according to Coinmarketcap data. BTC was recently trading at about $41,950, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nRead more: 12 Charts That Tell the Story of Crypto in 2023\n\nIn its newsletter on Monday, Kaiko Research, which tracks crypto market data, attributed the gap in no small part to rising optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve applications for long elusive spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nKaiko noted that BTC volatility has declined significantly since the summer not long after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and other financial powerhouses submitted their spot bitcoin ETF applications. The firm used the Sharpe Ratio, a measure of compensation that investors receive for taking on more risk where a higher ratio equals a better risk-adjusted return. BTC outperformed most traditional assets, including gold, and Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $4.6 Billion First Day Trading Volume\n\n\u201cThe difference in risk-adjusted returns can largely be chalked up to BTC\u2019s superior price performance this year. The ratio was about 0.072 at the start of the year and is now 0.053,\u201d Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey told Unchained in an email. \u201cETH has likely had a softer rally because the main catalyst/narrative \u2013 a potential spot BTC ETF \u2013 directly relates to BTC.\u201d\n\nBitcoin, which has a market capitalization of $812 billion compared to the $267 billion for Ethereum, is often hailed as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. As a result, bitcoin\u2019s price has tended to be more sensitive to global economic factors and policy changes such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments last week that another interest rate hike wasn\u2019t currently in discussion \u2013 a favorable sign for the asset.\n\nSpot ETF Applications Favor BTC\n\nThirteen companies have filed spot bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale, which hopes to turn its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The SEC\u2019s thinking on the Grayscale situation remains unclear and could delay that potential product\u2019s approval, although in an interview with Unchained, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart reiterated his belief that he expects the SEC to approve the applications en masse between Jan. 8 and 10.\n\nThe SEC is currently considering seven applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. While a BlackRock application last month caused ETH to have a stronger rally than BTC, there\u2019s general sentiment that bitcoin has an easier road to approval. This is partly because bitcoin is older, has a larger market capitalization and has a more straightforward use case. Ethereum, in contrast, is a more complex platform for decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nOn Monday, BlackRock and Bitwise filed amendments to their applications, a further indication of progress, Seyffart wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, another measure of crypto market optimism continued to point upward as inflows to digital asset investment products rose for a 10th consecutive week, according to research group CoinShares. The rise underscores institutional investors\u2019 interest in the asset.\n\nCoinShares data showed that bitcoin had $133 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $1.68 billion. But the group also found that Ethereum had just $31 million of inflows over the same period, bringing its net flows into the positive for the first time this year.\n\nIn an email to Unchained, Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, echoed Carey\u2019s comments. \u201cBitcoin has outperformed Ethereum in large part because many are anticipating that these spot BTC ETFs will likely get approved fairly soon,\u201d Levin wrote. \u201cAn ETH ETF might also be on the horizon, though it\u2019s less definitive than the Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of capital getting allocated to Bitcoin and this, in turn, is having an outsize impact on momentum.\u201d"

There are three key data points that might become a foundation for a new rally.\n\nInstitutional pivot: ETH Futures gain traction\n\nThe first sign comes from the futures market, where ETH's performance on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is turning heads. Ethereum futures are now trading at a 5% premium compared to Bitcoin's basis, a notable shift in institutional focus.\n\nInteresting to see the futures basis for ETH on CME is now trading at a 5% premium to the basis for BTC and open interest for ETH on CME is now starting to pick up after lagging BTC.\n\n\n\nEarly signs of tradfi starting to rotate into the ETH ETF trade? pic.twitter.com/o12EXjWsmZ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) December 4, 2023\n\nMoreover, open interest in ETH on the CME has seen an uptick, starting to outpace BTC after a period of lagging. This shift could indicate growing interest from traditional finance (TradFi) investors in Ethereum, potentially as a reaction to the burgeoning ETF market for ETH.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBullish technical outlook on ETH charts\n\nThe provided price chart offers a bullish technical outlook for Ethereum. A closer analysis reveals a strong uptrend, with ETH's price action forming higher highs and higher lows \u2013 a classic indicator of bullish momentum. The moving averages have aligned in a way that typically precedes bullish conditions: the 50-day moving average is well above the 200-day moving average, and the price is currently trading above both, confirming a \"golden cross\" formation. This technical pattern often attracts further buying from momentum traders, reinforcing the positive trend.\n\nDeFi as catalyst amid BTC's potential correction\n\nLastly, the potential for a correction in Bitcoin's (BTC) price may drive investors toward Ethereum, particularly as the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector gains more traction. Ethereum is the foundational platform for DeFi applications, and as this industry grows, ETH is likely to benefit from increased utility and demand. This, combined with a possible redistribution of capital from Bitcoin to Ethereum, could provide the necessary fuel for Ethereum's price growth."

        "content": "Today AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) said it purchased a \u20ac5 million tokenized green bond issued by Societe Generale using the CoinVertible for settlement. That\u2019s a stablecoin issued by Societe Generale FORGE. The transaction on the public Ethereum blockchain is part of a new joint experiment. In July AXA IM was a judge in SocGen Forge\u2019s tokenization hackathon.\n\nCoinVertible isn\u2019t designed as an average stablecoin, but instead for institutional usage. As in this case, there\u2019s a need for trusted on-chain settlement assets.\n\n\u201cThe aim of this initiative, carried out in collaboration with Societe Generale \u2013 FORGE, was to enable us to experiment the use of a stablecoin as a settlement asset to purchase a digital bond,\u201d said Laurence Arnold, Head of Innovation and Strategic Initiatives. \u201cOur ultimate objective is to optimise our existing processes by adopting the most advanced technologies, so we can offer the best possible services to our clients.\u201d\n\nSocGen\u2019s first digital green bond\n\nMeanwhile, the digital bond reports the carbon footprint of the security token issuance infrastructure on chain. Societe Generale issued a \u20ac10 million bond, with AXA IM taking half and Generali Investments the balance. It\u2019s a three year, senior preferred unsecured bond.\n\nDespite the stablecoin\u2019s launch in April, this is the first real use of it. The original stablecoin had zero transactions and was burned in October and updated to a new contract to support instant settlement. AXA IM\u2019s purchase of the stablecoin and transfer in exchange for the bond took place on Friday. SocGen Forge holds \u20ac10 million of the stablecoin, with another \u20ac500,000 issued to an unknown wallet last week.\n\nSince Friday there have also been some small transactions involving the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nAXA IM previously participated in the European Investment Bank Ethereum bond that was issued on Ethereum via SocGen FORGE\u2019s infrastructure. In March the French regulator AMF granted AXA IM its digital asset license. SocGen FORGE received its first license in September 2022 and an expanded version this July.\n\nUpdate: added details re bond amount and Generali"

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin's surge may be getting the headlines, but a number of altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also experiencing big gains.\n\nDogecoin, the biggest meme coin in existence and the 10th largest digital asset by market cap, was last week's biggest gainer and is still gaining today: over the past 24 hours, it's closing in on a 5% gain and is trading hands for $0.08.\n\nMeme coin Shiba Inu has also seen sizable gains, having risen nearly 6% in the past day. The Dogecoin competitor and meme coin is the 19th biggest cryptocurrency by market and is right now trading for $0.00000888.\n\nMeme coins\u2014volatile cryptocurrencies based on Internet memes\u2014last week got a boost after a number of new tokens sprung into existence following the deaths of legendary investor Charlie Munger and divisive diplomat Henry Kissinger. But the meme coins have already seen their moment pass.

It is currently priced at $2,208 per coin.\n\nAll eyes are on Bitcoin, though, which has continued to hit highs not seen since the biggest coin in existence crashed in May 2022.\n\nRenewed interest has flooded the market as investors are optimistic that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product after 10 years.\n\nThe asset has surged by over 12% in the past week but is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044; it is currently priced at $41,256 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin spin-off Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been one of the best performers of the top 20.

        "title": "NFT Trading Activity on Ethereum Surges, Reaching a Six-Month High - Unchained",
        "content": "NFTs are not dead, these are instead experiencing a resurgence in trading volume following a two-year low.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain are resurging, hitting their highest trading activity across all marketplaces in six months, following a recent two-year low.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume for the week ending on Monday, Dec. 4 exceeded 105,000 ETH, a more than 250% increase since the week ending on Oct. 9, Nansen data shows. A local trough in early October saw the lowest recorded level since July 2021, right before the first explosion in NFT trading.\n\nThese trends may be indicating an end to NFT winter.\n\nData\n\nfrom CoinGecko shows CryptoPunks, one of the earliest major NFT collections, have experienced an almost 45% jump in floor price over the past 30 days to 57.24 ETH. That figure remains well shy of its all-time high of 125 ETH, however.\n\nThe boom since October suggests that the \u201cmarket basically agrees that NFTs bottomed,\u201d blockchain analytics firm Parsec CEO Will Sheehan wrote to Unchained on Telegram. \u201cThe Punks rally was equivalent to a BTC rally for the NFT market. Now you see pockets of net buying in NFTs, Pudgies the most notable, but in general liquidity and attention in NFTs has inflected,\u201d said Sheehan.\n\nThe surge in NFT trading coincides with ETH rising to around $2,200, a price point that hasn\u2019t been seen since May 2022. \u201cMuch of the spike in NFT trading volume has to do with the price movement of ETH,\u201d wrote Cameron Thompson, community manager and editor for NFT gallery Tonic, in an email to Unchained. \u201cETH\u2019s 20% increase in the past month has not only driven the buying and selling of NFTs, but has also reinforced positive sentiments around tokenized collectibles \u2014 sentiments that have not been felt among the Web3 community in many months.\u201d\n\nThe majority of NFT trading volume these days takes place on Blur, the leading marketplace tailored for high-frequency traders, which launched in October 2022, with former market leader OpenSea coming in second.\n\nRenewed Interest and General Appeal Outside the Crypto Ecosystem\n\nCarlos Mercado, a data scientist at blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, expressed two noteworthy reasons for the increased trading volumes for NFTs. The first is renewed interest in \u201cmeme\u201d NFTs, like Pixelmon and Milady. \u201cThese often serve as proxies for leveraged ETH, so as ETH rises the store of value narrative rises,\u201d Mercado wrote to Unchained via Telegram. In the past 30 days, the floor prices of Pixelmon and Milady have increased 210% and 48%, respectively, per CoinGecko.\n\nThe second, wrote Mercado, is the \u201cnoticeable success (led by Nouns & Pudgy Penguins) in breaking out of crypto into the broader culture.\u201d In September, Pudgy Penguins debuted its toy collection across 2,000 Walmart stores in the United States. OpenSea\u2019s Pudgy Penguins page showed that in the past 30 days, volume increased 114% to 15,770 ETH, while its number of sales jumped 58% to 2,267 and floor price grew 83% to 9.7 ETH.\n\nData from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that Blur\u2019s lending smart contract holds the most Pudgy Penguins, with 477 NFTs, a roughly 9% increase in the past 24 hours. The second biggest holder of Pudgy Penguins is a smart contract associated with Flooring Protocol, which fractionalizes NFTs to lower barriers to entry for new participants.\n\nPseudonymous Blur co-founder Pacman did not return a request for comment as of press time."

        "title": "Analyst Says Ethereum Price Will Hit $28K Following BlackRock ETF Approval as BTC ETF Token Presale Passes $2M - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum will skyrocket in price should BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF gain the SEC\u2019s approval, according to analysts. This will result in more than 10x growth based on its current price.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF Token presale recently hit $2m as analysts provide 10-100x price predictions.\n\nUnprecedented Institutional Captial Anticipated as Key Price Driver\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a notable spike in November when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled down on its crypto efforts, filing for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be listed on Nasdaq, opening the door to a broad new audience previously deterred from buying ETH for technical, security, or liquidity reasons.\n\nThis would propel cryptocurrency to a legitimate investment opportunity, even for traditional investors. As such, it is no surprise that Ethereum\u2019s price is rising in anticipation, currently at $2.09K, up 15% in the last month.\n\nYet, some analysts are significantly bullish on where Ethereum could be headed in the upcoming market cycle.\n\nIn a breakdown on TheStreet, prominent analyst Austin Arnold said, \u201cThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, is now backing both Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d suggesting this is of monumental importance for the assets\u2019 future.\n\nHe then considered BlackRock\u2019s assets under management (AUM), how much it may allocate to the ETH ETF, and how this could impact the asset\u2019s market cap.\n\nArnold then discussed a bull case following the ETF approval, contemplating Ethereum could climb to highs of $41,000. However, he stated, \u201cI do not see Ethereum getting that far.\u201d\n\nInstead, the analyst sees a more realistic prediction being $28,000, or $10,000.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s $28,000, $45,000, $10,000, I\u2019d be happy with anything, but I\u2019m a long-term holder,\u201d Arnold concluded.\n\nOne of the factors that he highlighted was the difference in Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s structure, tokenomics, and utility. He explained, \u201cOne\u2019s digital gold, it\u2019s aiming to be a store of value. While Ethereum is like digital oil, used to power a global, decentralized supercomputer, build apps. Just like a car needs gasoline to be able to run, Ethereum is the gas that makes the system work.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also referenced Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism, which makes the token deflationary by destroying a small part of each transaction fee. Coupled with the incoming ETF liquidity inflows, Arnold believes this could significantly bolster its price.\n\nHowever, he understands there is a ceiling to how far it can go in the next market cycle. \u201c$10,000 ETH is the most realistic scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nThis represents less than a 5x gain from its current price. While this is a significant return for those with large portfolios, it is unlikely to render sufficient returns for those with limited financial resources.\n\nOne alternative with a lot of upside potential is Bitcoin ETF Token, a new trending presale that has raised over $2.1 million in three weeks amid the BlackRock hype.\n\nStake-to-Earn Bitcoin ETF Token ICO Hits $2M Milestone\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is a compelling new project that rewards holders in line with key Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nThe project has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned as Bitcoin ETFs reach five main targets, creating a sense of scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) when the hype is highest.\n\nIt also features a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each milestone. This incentivizes people to hold longer and ensures explosive price action following the project\u2019s IEO.\n\nThese factors make Bitcoin ETF Token deflationary, introducing the scarcity principle into the project, which has been a key driver for Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic price action since its launch in 2009.\n\nAnother exciting factor is its staking mechanism, rewarding its community and incentivizing users to lock up their tokens, further limiting the available supply.\n\nHolders can garner a 118% staking APY, but they must be quick because this decreases as more users stake their tokens.\n\nThe project has experienced significant success lately, with top analysts providing massively bullish predictions. Jacob Bury speculates it will 10x after its launch, while Crypto Boy believes it could 100x.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

Specifically, talks with Spot BTC ETF issuers have advanced to key technical details, with Reuters indicating that it could signal a shift toward a potential approval.\n\nAlso Read: This is the level to beat as Bitcoin eyes $50,000 next\n\nBitcoin price could overcome $43,860\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is confronting the $43,860 critical support, marking the midline of a weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A decisive candlestick close above this mean threshold on the weekly timeframe would confirm the continuation of the primary trend, flipping the supply barrier into a bullish breaker and using it as the springboard for a race to the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, indicating momentum continues to rise. Meanwhile, the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remain in positive territory, flashing green to show that bulls are leading the BTC market. These bolster the case to the upside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flipside, if the supply zone holds as a resistance level, Bitcoin price could face a rejection, deflecting south to lose the support offered by the $40,000 psychological level. In a worse case, the fall could extend to the $30,000 psychological level, with a weekly candlestick close below this level invalidating the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price hits $44,000 as Coinbase CEO speculates BTC could be key to extending Western civilization\n\nEthereum price could climb 7%\n\nEthereum (ETH) price action remains bullish since mid-October, consolidating within an ascending parallel channel. This is a bullish technical formation, promising more growth as long as the asset\u2019s price remains within its confines.\n\nWith both the RSI and AO indicators supporting the bullish outlook, Ethereum price could rise 7% to the $2,500 level last tested in May 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, should profit-taking kick in, Ethereum price could fail to realize the $2,500 target. The ensuing selling pressure could see ETH dwindle to lose the $2,147 support.\n\nEthereum price could then extend a leg down, converting the midline of the April 18 supply zone extending from $2,049 to $2,107 from a resistance area into a support area by breaking and closing below its midline at $2,075. A daily candlestick close below this level would not only invalidate the bullish thesis but also confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH attempts to flip $2,300 into support"

        "title": "Why Did Ethereum Price Reach A New Yearly High? | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The Ethereum price has reached a new yearly high after a massive weekend rally that sent most of the crypto market into the green. This rally has put the Ethereum price above the $2,200 level for the first time in 2023, sparking speculations as to what could be behind the price surge.\n\nEthereum Following The King: Bitcoin\n\nOne of the major reasons that the Ethereum price rallied to a new yearly high is the fact that the price of Bitcoin is also on an uptrend. Bitcoin which is benefitting immensely from the hype around a potential Spot Bitcoin ETF approval jumped to its own yearly highs back in November, and after clearing the $40,000 level this year, the leading cryptocurrency pulled up the rest of the market with it.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin has spilled over into cryptocurrencies such as ETH and even though the Bitcoin dominance remains high, it has not stopped altcoins from actually rallying alongside it. There has also been an Ethereum short squeeze, sending over $30 million in shorts into liquidation.\n\nGreed Is on The Rise\n\nAs expected, there has been a lot of greed in the market as prices have recovered. This has helped the entrance of new money into the market, pumping the price of Ethereum as well. According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, greed levels among crypto investors are at one of the highest levels of the year.\n\nCurrently sitting at a score of 74 on the index, it is the closes to extreme greed that it has gotten. However, the fact that the index has not entered the extreme greed territory suggests that the rally might not be over. This is because rallies like these usually come to an end when extreme greed is on the high side.\n\nETH rises to a new yearly high | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nWhales Get In on The Action\n\nThere has been a lot of activity from Ethereum whales who have been buying up the cryptocurrency in large quantities. Ethereum\u2019s trading volume has jumped significantly, rising 17% in the last day alone to reach $11.4 billion.\n\nWith such a significant rise in volume, it points to large investors, not smaller investors, actually leading the charge this time around. As reported by NewsBTC, Ethereum, alongside Bitcoin, has dominated the total crypto trading volume recently.\n\nEthereum Lagging Behind Bitcoin\n\nInterestingly, while the Ethereum price has mostly followed Bitcoin, it has not seen the same performance that Bitcoin has seen. For example, while Bitcoin hit a new yearly high in November, ETH did not do so until December.\n\nThen looking at the charts, the last time that the Bitcoin price was above $41,000, the Ethereum price was trading at $2,700. However, this time around, ETH is lagging behind and is currently trading at $2,200 compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $41,000.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum is still looking quite bullish. Its price is up 3.91% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,248 at the time of this writing.\n\nFeatured image from Forkast News, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "After nine months in development, Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle has launched its second core product, Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP).\n\nThis new protocol, deployed on Mantle and Ethereum mainnet, introduces a non-custodial and permissionless ether liquid staking solution, Mantle Staked Ether (mETH).\n\nMETH acts as a value-accumulating receipt token within the Mantle LSP, very similar to Lido\u2019s staked ether (stETH). Mantle aims to achieve the highest sustainable core yield by exploring maximal extractable value. It also shares yield from the Mantle treasury, according to a statement released Monday.\n\nThe idea for mETH came from Mantle \u201calchemist\u201d Jordi Alexander, chief information officer at Selini Capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just created a lighter weight, more modern Lido,\u201d Alexander told Blockworks. He champions the idea of offering a native staking yield on an Ethereum layer-2. The premise is \u201cwe should do all of DeFi, but first start by having the 5% yield,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis is the same promise of the planned Blast layer-2, which has attracted deposits of ether (ETH) and stablecoins now topping $750 million over the past two weeks.\n\nBlast, despite its rapid growth and ambitious plans, faces scrutiny over its security model and the centralization concerns related to its reliance on Lido.\n\nRead more: Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate\n\n\u201cKudos to the Blast team because it\u2019s the same idea that I had but just a very different implementation,\u201d said Alexander, who has been advising Mantle since March and serves on investment and treasury committees.\n\n\u201cI was pretty excited [when Blast launched] because they\u2019re educating the market on this idea\u201d of having native staking yield available for DeFi on a layer-2, he said.\n\nThe Mantle LSP development process represents a more traditional, structured approach with a focus on security and integration within its ecosystem.\n\nThe team decided to build a solution from scratch, but also talked to Lido about the idea of white labeling their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe talked to everybody \u2014 we literally went through every single [liquid staking team] out there \u2014 including Lido of course \u2014 we had multiple chats with them to decide [if] there [is] a way that we can take the easy way out,\u201d Alexander said, adding \u201cwe decided to go the hard route, and it\u2019s taken many months to do it properly and get all the audits and everything.\u201d\n\nThe various components of the Mantle LSP have been audited by Hexens, MixBytes, Secure3 and Verilog, and the contract upgradeability is the responsibility of the Mantle Security Council, a 6 of 12 multisig, which is also used for maintenance of the Mantle Network itself.\n\n\u201cIf you trust Mantle, it\u2019s the same security,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nUnlike Blast, Mantle LSP doesn\u2019t force anyone to stake or bridge. METH will work just fine on Ethereum mainnet and Alexander stressed that it is an independent product from the Mantle Network.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some people that just want to stay on [Ethereum] mainnet and we do want to cater to them as well,\u201d but, he adds, \u201cI expect that most of it eventually will get incentivized to move because we\u2019ll make it really juicy to ship it over.\u201d\n\nThese incentives can be seen as a vampire attack on Lido, which Alexander says should appeal to members of the Ethereum community concerned over excessive Lido centralization.\n\nWhat\u2019s cooking in \u201cthe mETH lab\u201d?\n\nThe Mantle team has a number of ideas in the works to expand upon the LSP\u2019s use within its network, which will be proposed to holders of the MNT governance token in the coming weeks.\n\nMNT is also used to pay transaction fees on the Mantle Network.\n\nAlexander originally considered mETH as a good candidate for the Mantle gas token \u2014 \u201clike a self-replenishing gas,\u201d he said \u2014 but ultimately Mantle\u2019s mainnet launch schedule led to the introduction of MNT.\n\nThe team might consider a dual gas token model, make use of account abstraction to reduce user friction, or outline other new utilities for MNT.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have it be sort of like ATOM where you get airdrops and it\u2019s kind of like a launch pool token,\u201d Alexander said, referring to the native asset of the Cosmos Hub.\n\nHe agrees with the critique that Ethereum has too many layer-2 networks proliferating, suggesting that most lack a creative new idea.\n\n\u201cIs there something unique or some imagination that\u2019s gone into it instead of just deploying a tenth version of Aave and just doing the same USDT pair or whatever?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\n\nAnd as for the name and its natural association with illicit drugs?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to just lean into it.

        "content": "Binance has expanded its free trading options for the spot and margin trading pairs of the First Digital USD (FDUSD) stablecoin pairing with six digital assets, including BNB, Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, according to a Dec. 5 statement.\n\nBinance users will see zero maker and taker fees for these pairs starting Dec. 8 for an undisclosed period. The exchange explained that the free trading option would exclude these pairs from BNB fee discounts, rebates, and other adjustments.\n\nHowever, the firm stated that it \u201creserves the right to disqualify trades deemed to be wash trades or illegally bulk account registrations, as well as trades that display attributes of self-dealing or market manipulation.\u201d\n\nBinance is actively pushing FDUSD.\n\nThe free transaction promotion is part of Binance\u2019s ongoing efforts to encourage its users to use the FDUSD stablecoin.\n\nLast week, the crypto platform said it would phase out support for Binance USD (BUSD) by Dec. 15. Binance urged users to convert their BUSD holdings into the new stablecoin before the end of the year, saying it would end BUSD withdrawals by Dec. 31 and that BUSD balances would be automatically converted to FDUSD.\n\nBinance\u2019s decision relates to the BUSD stablecoin\u2019s regulatory issues. Earlier in the year, the BUSD issuer, Paxos, suspended the stablecoin issuance following scrutiny from U.S. regulators. At the time, the company received a Wells Notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which classified the stablecoin as a security.\n\nWhile Binance and Paxos have vehemently rejected this classification, the crypto community promptly deserted the stablecoin, with its circulating supply dropping to less than $2 billion as of press time, according to CryptoSlate\u2019s data.\n\nConcurrently, Binance has been heavily pushing FDUSD as a viable alternative, introducing new products for the digital asset and incentivizing its use. However, FDUSD\u2019s circulating supply remains less than 1 billion and is only available on less than five crypto exchanges.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Mantle introduces mETH liquid staking protocol, expanding its Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Mantle, the DAO-led web3 ecosystem, today unveiled its Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP) as a key addition to the Mantle Ecosystem, offering users a novel way to engage with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) validator network, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nThe Mantle LSP is a permissionless and non-custodial Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking protocol, functioning on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle. It stands as the second core product of the Mantle Ecosystem, following the Mantle Network L2. Mantle posits that the introduction of Mantle Staked Ether (mETH), a value-accumulating receipt token, is a pivotal step in their protocol.\n\nMantle detailed that the genesis of Mantle LSP began with a proposal in a Mantle forum on July 14, 2023. Following the acceptance of the Mantle Governance Proposal MIP-25, the staking of Mantle Treasury ETH was sanctioned, leading to the phased deployment of Mantle LSP. This process culminated in the protocol\u2019s full operational launch on Dec. 4, transitioning it into a Permissionless Mode.\n\nMantle LSP distinguishes itself by offering instant and sustainable rewards. Users staking ETH receive mETH, a token embodying their staked value and accumulated rewards, while also unlocking additional yield opportunities within the Mantle Ecosystem. Mantle states that the ETH to mETH exchange rate is deterministically calculated, thus mitigating the impact of stake size on slippage. Furthermore, mETH is available for trade on various exchanges, with its pricing governed by market dynamics.\n\nMantle emphasizes that their protocol underscores a commitment to user experience, security, and yield optimization. Mantle states its LSP features a streamlined architecture, focusing on the ETH to mETH conversion process on L1, and avoids complexities associated with other PoS tokens and chains. The protocol\u2019s design incorporates robust risk management strategies, including non-custodial core smart contracts and off-chain services that impose strict risk limits. Additionally, Mantle LSP\u2019s security framework involves dividing responsibilities among various roles, ensuring the safeguarding of staked ETH within smart contract addresses.\n\nWith the launch of Mantle LSP, Mantle intends to enhance its DeFi offerings by exploring the adoption of mETH across various applications within its ecosystem and beyond. This expansion aims to bolster the utility and efficiency of mETH, contributing significantly to Mantle\u2019s growth in the DeFi space.\n\nThe broader Mantle ecosystem, anchored in Ethereum technology, now includes the Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solution, Mantle Governance, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and Mantle Treasury, one of the largest on-chain treasuries. The ecosystem is facilitated by the Mantle token (MNT), which serves as a product and governance token.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "With Bitcoin mining stocks surging, analysts and even legacy banks like JPMorgan Chase are increasingly bullish on the sector\u2019s prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum-based project Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is nearing $5 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), thanks to the buzz around its innovative Stake-to-Mine model.\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Sector \u2013 A Brief Overview\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using specialized computers to solve complex math problems that validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn return, miners earn BTC as a reward \u2013 providing an incentive to continue mining.\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s early days, mining was possible on regular home computers.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin network has grown, mining has become increasingly competitive, spurring an arms race in mining hardware development.\n\nThe introduction of ASIC mining rigs has enabled industrial-scale Bitcoin mining operations, helping the mining sector balloon to a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by large firms.\n\nAlthough the sector\u2019s energy consumption has raised environmental concerns, recent innovations have begun to focus on boosting efficiency in a greener way.\n\nMoreover, these concerns have led to the exploration of alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power in BTC mining operations.\n\nAccording to a report from Industry Research Co., the entire crypto-mining market was valued at $4.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $4.7 billion by 2028.\n\nAnalysts & JPMorgan Bullish on Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nSeveral analysts, and even huge financial institutions like JPMorgan, are growing increasingly optimistic about the prospects of companies that operate in the crypto mining space.\n\nCleanSpark ($CLSK), in particular, has attracted bullish praise recently.\n\nIn a recent research note, JPMorgan called CleanSpark its \u201ctop pick\u201d among mining stocks, citing its \u201cscale, growth potential, power costs & relative value.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, crypto analyst UltraXBT expressed confidence in CleanSpark at current levels, claiming it\u2019s a \u201c$25 stock that is currently identifying as a $4.50 stock.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ThoughtfulTrade on Twitter noted that a Bitcoin breakout above $46,000 could spur the price of mining stocks like CleanSpark to soar even higher.\n\nWith BTC mining profitability improving due to the crypto market\u2019s recovery, firms like CleanSpark that leverage low-cost power stand to capitalize.\n\nMoreover, the upbeat outlook from JPMorgan and analysts reflects the growing optimism around the Bitcoin mining space in general.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix Platform Introduces Innovative Stake-to-Mine Model & Raises $4.8 Million\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining stocks like CleanSpark offer indirect exposure to crypto prices, a new altcoin project called Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) aims to reinvent mining rewards through staking.\n\nThe Ethereum-based Stake-to-Mine protocol allows users to earn regular BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens rather than purchasing expensive hardware.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s protocol works by distributing \u201cmining credits\u201d to those who stake BTCMTX, which can be exchanged for cloud mining power.\n\nIn turn, this democratizes access to BTC mining by lowering the barriers to entry \u2013 meaning anyone can get involved.\n\nThe Stake-to-Mine mechanism also enables considerable staking yields, with current APYs exceeding 120%.\n\nUltimately, by reinventing mining rewards and making hash power more accessible, Bitcoin Minetrix has the potential to transform the crypto-mining space.\n\nOn the back of strong interest surrounding its unique value proposition, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team recently launched a presale for BTCMTX.\n\nThe presale aims to raise funds to develop and scale the Stake-to-Mine platform further.\n\nMore than $4.8 million has already been raised from eager investors, with BTCMTX tokens available to buy for $0.012 each.\n\nOnce the presale concludes, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s team plans to list BTCMTX on leading centralized exchanges, enabling seamless trading for speculative investors.\n\nWith strong presale momentum and backing from high-profile names like VoskCoin, BTCMTX seems poised to make a splash when public trading begins.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "title": "Spain detains aristocrat who allegedly recruited Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith to help North Korea - DLNews",
        "content": "Spanish officials detained Alejandro Cao de Benos, a Spanish aristocrat.\n\nHe allegedly enlisted Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions.\n\nSpanish officials detained on Thursday a pro-North Korea political activist aristocrat accused of aiding North Korea in circumventing international sanctions through crypto, according to a statement by the Spanish police.\n\nAlejandro Cao de Benos, the founder of advocacy group Korea Friendship Association, was indicted last year by US authorities for allegedly recruiting Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to unlawfully provide crypto services to North Korea.\n\n\u201cSuch accusations are totally false. There is not a single piece of evidence that proves that I hired or solicited the services of Virgil Griffith,\u201d Cao de Benos said in a public statement posted Sunday on X.\n\nThe police said investigation for his location began in mid-October, when the agents received a tipoff from Interpol indicating that Cao de Benos could be in Spain.\n\nCao de Benos was released after a one-day detention.\n\n\u201cIt is a disgrace that the US empire abuses Interpol and Spain to carry out what is purely political persecution,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum researcher Virgil Griffith\n\nGriffith, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, was arrested in 2019 after a trip to North Korea to allegedly consult the regime on how to use crypto to evade international sanctions.\n\nHis keynote speech at the Pyongyang conference allegedly contained information on how to bypass sanctions, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut Griffith\u2019s advocates and his legal team have argued that the presentation did no more than recapitulate widely available information, which could be readily accessed online.\n\nGriffith\u2019s lawyer said that the trip was \u201cthe culmination of Virgil\u2019s unique and unfortunate curiosity and obsession with North Korea.\u201d\n\nHe received a 63-month prison sentence last year after pleading guilty to a charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The act forbids US citizens from exporting goods, services, or technology to North Korea without a licence from the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nHis lawyer told the Wall Street Journal that Griffith was \u201csincerely remorseful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Emms dodges the bullet\n\nBritish national Christopher Emms was also charged last year, alongside Cao de Benos, with the conspiracy to help North Korea access crypto. He had attended the same conference as Griffith.\n\nIn June, Emms said he received political asylum in Russia.\n\nAppearing on Russian state media RT yesterday, Emms called Cao de Benos\u2019 detention \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and said the \u201cUS government doesn\u2019t like when someone stands up to them.\u201d\n\nEmms told Blockworks last year that Cao de Benos contacted him through LinkedIn and invited him to the conference in Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cI did the typical crypto bro thing: I googled it. I checked the Foreign Office website as a UK citizen. I checked the UN website and I didn\u2019t see that speaking at a conference in North Korea was breaking any laws,\u201d Emms said.\n\nThe North Korea trip was \u201cincredibly naive,\u201d Emms said, but \u201cthe way we [the crypto industry] approached things was so different than we would right now. There was a lack of clarity on so many things.\u201d\n\nCrypto: North Korea\u2019s \u2018treasure sword\u2019\n\nNorth Korea calls crypto its \u201ctreasure sword,\u201d according to David Maxwell, senior fellow at the think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, who spoke with DL News in April.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s crypto arm known as Lazarus Group has stolen at least $3.4 billion in crypto since emerging in 2007, according to calculations by DL News.\n\n\u201cAll the money [the North Korean hackers] cash out goes to fund their missile programme,\u201d Erin Plante, vice-president of investigations at Chainalysis, told DL News in April. A report by Recorded Future last week said that North Korea loots enough crypto to fund almost half of its military budget.\n\nLast year, Lazarus hacked a record a $625 million in crypto, raiding the web3 game Axie Infinity.\n\nThat attack, said Plante, was \u201ca turning-point event where suddenly the US National Security Council cared and wanted to hear about it.\u201d"

        "title": "How a Photographer Missed Out on $8 Million for This Portrait of a Crypto Billionaire - PetaPixel",
        "content": "Being a freelance photographer is not easy. Chasing invoices, dealing with late payments, the list goes on, but very few have ever missed out on a payment of $8 million that was rightfully theirs.\n\nBut that\u2019s what happened to photographer Andrew Miller after he took a portrait of Vitalik Buterin, who co-founded the cryptocurrency Ethereum and went on to become the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaire.\n\nLong before Russian-Canadian programmer Buterin made the Forbes rich list, Miller, a self-confessed gamer geek, had taken a keen interest in the enigmatic programmer and approached him with a portrait idea around the same time Buterin was launching Ethereum. Buterin agreed, but back then he was cash-strapped so one of his investors came up with the idea of paying Miller in the upcoming Ethereum currency.\n\nMiller paid for the shoot at his own expense \u2014 which included dinner, a photo assistant, and a makeup artist \u2014 and agreed to be paid in the initial coin offering so long as it was the equivalent of the $1,200 CAD ($886) that Miller deemed to be the value of his photo shoot.\n\nThis is Where it Gets Interesting\n\nMiller tells PetaPixel that he was supposed to have been paid for the copyright of the photo during the initial coin offering when the price of Etherum was $0.31, meaning the photographer ought to have received somewhere between 3,225 and 3,600 Ether. Today, 3,600 Ether is worth nearly $8 million (10.8 million CAD).\n\n\u201cI said if they started using it commercially they could pay me in Ether at the initial coin offering amount. They agreed in principle and would investigate how to get the coins to me through their execution of the offering. It was still a new process for them and theoretical,\u201d Miller says.\n\n\u201cI met them in Vancouver two weeks later at the 2014 Coinfest and hung around for lunch and other gatherings. I queried them on how payment would play out and Anthony [an investor] set me up with a Bitcoin wallet to demonstrate how one would send coins back and forth,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cIt was always my understanding that I would receive Ether at the initial coin offering. I just thought that in the end, they didn\u2019t use the image commercially. Everything was not traditionally public and the Ethereum website was sparse for photos.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, Miller never received the cryptocurrency and after losing contact with Buterin, he was oblivious that his photo had been disseminated commercially. It was being used in news articles, memes, fan art, and even being sold as knock-off NFTs with zero credit given to Miller.\n\nDespite numerous attempts to reach Buterin, Miller has not heard from the Ethereum co-founder and now says he is \u201ctrapped in a situation where there is no response from Vitalik or the Ethereum organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy portraits appear to have been instrumental in shaping the positive perception of Vitalik and contributed in some small part to Ethereum\u2019s rise,\u201d Miller writes in an article for DIY Photography.\n\n\u201cToday, I am battling to gain attribution and recognition after the portraits became famous, leaving my name unspoken. The history of what I did for Vitalik was untold, and anyone looking back can see its value given the timing and what transpired afterwards. Any joy I took in seeing my photos fulfilling the role I originally intended was quelled when I learned that they had been used commercially by the Ethereum co-founders, who never fulfilled their end of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nMiller stresses he has never issued an invoice, largely because if he does, Canadian law requires him to declare it as income immediately and pay income and sales tax on it regardless whether he\u2019s received the payment or not.\n\nPetaPixel has reached out to Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum for comment but did not hear back ahead of publication.\n\nMore of Miller\u2019s work can be found on his website and Instagram.\n\nImage credits: Photographs by Andrew Miller."

Buterin has appeared more times than other prominent personalities, such as Do Kwon of Terra Luna, Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance, Gary Gensler of the U.S. SEC, Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, and Jack Dorsey of Twitter (now X).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, former Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase and the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, made three appearances on CoinDesk\u2019s ranking.

However, instead of commenting on Vitalik Buterin\u2019s influential status, he tilted the discussion in another direction. In particular, Hoskinson remarked:\n\n\n\n\u201cAppearing on Coindesk\u2019s most influential list carries an 18 percent chance of a prison sentence,\u201d teasing it as some \u2018fun fact.\u2019\n\nFast Fact: appearing on Coindesk's most influential list carries an 18 percent chance of a prison sentence https://t.co/SdAOqcPOPQ \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 3, 2023\n\nNotably, the foundation of Hoskinson\u2019s \u201c18% chance of prison\u201d is that of the 16 crypto personalities in the CoinDesk ranking, three have had devastating legal encounters with prison sentences in sight.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThree of 16 is 18.75%. Therefore, Hoskinson argued that each individual on CoinDesk\u2019s personality rankings has an 18% chance of facing a prison sentence.\n\nCrypto Community Reacts\n\nMeanwhile, some crypto community members argued Hoskinson appears jealous because he has failed to feature in the ranks of the most influential crypto personalities. Crypto Youtuber Lex Blazer remarked:\n\n\u201cI know CoinDesk is biased against you, but damn, not even once? How many blockchain features has Cardano pioneered at scale?\u201d\n\nOthers contended that the Cardano founder was intentionally refusing to acknowledge that \u201cVitalik is the greatest of all time (GOAT).\u201d\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Hoskinson and the Ethereum community have been at loggerheads, which all stemmed from Hoskinson\u2019s removal from the Ethereum cycle years ago."

        "title": "Ether vs Ethereum: The Key Behind Crypto Development - INDODAX",
        "content": "In discussions about the world of crypto assets, the role of Ether (ETH) and blockchain platform, Ethereum is very important and needs to be understood. Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform that executes computer programs known as smart contracts.\n\nIt has a native crypto asset called Ether (ETH), which is the crypto asset with the second largest market capitalization after Bitcoin. However, Ether is a crypto asset and a \u201cgas fee,\u201d enabling various decentralized transactions and applications or Decentralized Applications (dApps) to operate within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAs a blockchain platform, Ethereum is known to have created the foundation for major innovation in the crypto world. By understanding the differences and relationships between Ether and Ethereum, we can avoid any misunderstandings that may arise. This means that Ether is not just a digital coin but also a key element that drives the economy on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSo, to understand what Ether (ETH) is, its role in the Ethereum ecosystem, the relationship between the two, and the latest trends and future projections for Ether, see the complete review below!\n\nWhat is Ether (ETH)?\n\nIt is important to know that the Ethereum blockchain is one of the oldest and most widely used blockchain networks. Ether, which functions as a gas fee, has become one of the leading cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin in terms of market value.\n\nAs explained at the beginning of this article, Ether is a native coin or native asset used in the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate transactions throughout its ecosystem. Every transaction in the Ethereum ecosystem requires payment of a computing fee (gas fee) to the miners who carry out the transaction computation. This payment is made using Ether.\n\nThese gas fees increase with the computational complexity required. For example, the shipping costs of ERC-20 tokens are higher than sending ETH because sending ERC-20 tokens uses interaction and computing on smart contracts while sending ETH does not involve such a process.\n\nETH has various uses as a digital asset and for carrying out various transactions in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Please note that Ethereum has become one of the most widely used blockchain platforms for building dApps, along with its ability to support more programs than Bitcoin.\n\nAs a crypto asset, ETH has an important role as gas fees are paid to run computations on various applications developed on the Ethereum platform. This makes ETH one of the second largest crypto assets after Bitcoin when viewed from market value.\n\nWhen it was first traded, the value of one Ethereum coin was around $2.83 or around IDR 41,035. However, in June 2021, the price of ETH jumped to $2,578 per coin, or the equivalent of IDR 36,822,218. ETH\u2019s highest price peak occurred in November 2021, reaching $4,620. However, in December 2022, the price of Ethereum will decrease to $1,225 per coin, or the equivalent of IDR 19,264,748.\n\nSo, if you are interested in buying ETH, you can purchase through a trusted crypto buying and selling application, namely INDODAX. As a platform, INDODAX has been officially registered as a Physical Crypto Asset Trader under the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (BAPPEBTI) so that security is guaranteed. You can download the INDODAX application to buy ETH.\n\nThe Role of Ether in the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nIt is important to understand that Ether (ETH) is important in the Ethereum ecosystem and is used for various purposes on the network. One of Ether\u2019s main roles in the Ethereum ecosystem is as a digital asset.\n\nInitially, Ether was created as a digital asset for use on the Ethereum network. Most transactions and smart contracts are carried out using Ether. In this case, users can send and receive Ether within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEther\u2019s other main role is to pay transaction fees. Every time someone sends Ether or performs a function within a smart contract, they have to pay a transaction fee. These fees are known as \u201cgas,\u201d which is necessary to ensure that the Ethereum network runs efficiently and prevents network abuse.\n\nThe gas is a unit of measurement for measuring how much computing power is needed to complete a task on the Ethereum network. Smart contract transactions/execution require gas, and transaction fees are calculated based on the amount of gas used.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether also plays an important role in maintaining network security. Miners who process transactions and secure the network will receive rewards in the form of Ether for their efforts. This also provides incentives for miners to maintain network reliability and security.\n\nApart from that, Ether is also used as a store of value in the network\u2019s decision-making process to create tokens and to run smart contracts on the Ethereum network. For example, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens are often created using Ether as \u201cgas\u201d to carry out smart contracts.\n\nEthereum Ecosystem: Beyond Ether\n\nAs previously explained, smart contract technology on Ethereum drives new innovations in financial transactions. The following are several examples of smart contract implementation that are currently underway including:\n\n1. Stablecoins\n\nCrypto asset prices are often very volatile. Stablecoins , which utilizes smart contract technology, also solves this problem. The value of stablecoins is held to the value of non-digital assets, such as the rupiah and US dollar, to maintain their stability.\n\nSome well-known stablecoins maintain stability by guaranteeing a 1:1 rate with the original currency and being convertible to that currency. For example, Rupiah Token (IDRT), a crypto asset on the Ethereum blockchain, has a value equivalent to the rupiah. IDRT creates a digital representation of rupiah by generating tokens in proportion to the amount of rupiah deposited by the user and sending them to the user\u2019s Ethereum wallet.\n\nApart from IDRT, another example of a stablecoin, namely USD Coin (USDC), is designed to have the same value as the US dollar. The existence of stablecoins makes it easier for users to transfer value to various places around the world in a short time. Stablecoins also provide the stability needed in the crypto ecosystem and connect traditional financial infrastructure with the blockchain world.\n\n2. Borrow and Borrow on Ethereum\n\nSmart contract technology on the Ethereum blockchain also enables the development of crypto asset lending and lending applications. For example, AAVE and Compound are decentralized lending and lending Apps (dApps) based in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith AAVE and Compound, users can deposit crypto assets to earn interest or borrow other crypto assets. Using these two applications requires an Ethereum wallet and a certain amount of funds in the form of ETH or ERC-20 tokens. With AAVE and Compound, anyone can be involved in asset lending and lending activities without relying on banks or traditional financial institutions.\n\n3. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are applications that facilitate token exchange using smart contract technology. One example of a very popular DEX built on Ethereum is Uniswap and Sushiswap.\n\nThrough DEXs, users can exchange ETH for ERC-20 tokens or vice versa and exchange between ERC-20 tokens. As long as it follows the ERC-20 token standard, various types of tokens can be exchanged using DEXs.\n\nThe Connection Between the Two\n\nEther (ETH) and Ethereum are interrelated concepts, but they have different roles in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain platform allowing developers to create and run dApps. On the other hand, Ether is a crypto asset used on the Ethereum network.\n\nRemember that Ethereum is designed to support smart contracts, programming codes that can execute certain tasks when specified conditions are met. Ether is used as \u201cgas\u201d to carry out these operations, including executing smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is also used as an incentive for miners (or validators in the context of Ethereum 2.0), which helps keep the network decentralized and secure. Miners will receive Ether in exchange for adding blocks to the blockchain.\n\nEther is also used as a digital asset to carry out transactions within the Ethereum network. Every time someone sends Ether, it automatically reflects a transfer of value within the Ethereum ecosystem. Meanwhile, when someone runs or interacts with smart contracts, he must pay transaction fees in the form of Ether. This helps prevent network abuse and ensures that people who use network resources pay for that use.\n\nEthereum and Ether complement each other. Ether itself is essential to maintaining the functionality of the Ethereum network. Without Ether, executing transactions, implementing smart contracts, or ensuring network security would be impossible. The existence of Ether itself supports the Ethereum ecosystem by providing incentives for developers to create decentralized applications and for miners (validators) to keep the network safe and decentralized.\n\nHistory and Evolution\n\nThe history of Ether and Ethereum is known to have reflected a long journey towards the development of blockchain technology and the growth of the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Referring to its history, Ethereum was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. It was an evolution of the idea to expand Bitcoin\u2019s functionality by enabling smart contracts.\n\nThe funding for Ethereum development was obtained through an initial public offering (ICO) in 2014, where Ether (ETH) was first sold to investors. Furthermore, Ethereum was launched on July 30, 2015, with the launch of the first block, or \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d\n\nAs time passes, Ethereum 2.0 aims to move away from consensus Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which began to be developed to increase network scalability and efficiency. The first phases of Ethereum 2.0 are launched, and the transition towards PoS begins.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Ethereum as a new blockchain platform and raising funds through ICOs is known to have played an important role in forming the modern crypto ecosystem. One of the important events that shaped their role in the crypto industry was when an attack occurred on Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO). In 2016, an attack on the DAO on Ethereum led to a massive theft of Ether.\n\nTo overcome the consequences of the DAO attack, the Ethereum community decided to carry out a hard fork, then created Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate blockchain chains. Ultimately, efforts to improve network performance and security through Ethereum 2.0 and the transition to PoS are important steps in Ethereum\u2019s evolution.\n\nThe Importance of Maintaining Both\n\nIt should be emphasized that Ether is the driving force in the Ethereum ecosystem. By maintaining its sustainability, Ether continues to support the execution of transactions and smart contracts on the network. This is important for maintaining blockchain functionality and allowing various decentralized applications to run. Apart from that, Ether also plays an important role in maintaining the resilience of the Ethereum network. Through incentives for miners (or validators in Ethereum 2.0), Ether ensures that the network remains secure, distributed, and resistant to attacks.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum powered by Ether also plays a key role in driving innovation in Decentralized Finance(DeFi). Ether\u2019s sustainability supports liquidity, collateral, and smart contract functionality that is the foundation for various DeFi projects, from loans to exchanges to other protocols.\n\nEthereum, which can run smart contracts, is known to have paved the way for various use cases, including finance, logistics, digital identity, and many others. Therefore, maintaining Ether is key to ensuring that innovation continues to develop in various sectors. On the other hand, Ethereum has also become the main platform for DeFi projects. The growth of DeFi is also one of the main factors driving wider crypto adoption, as it provides a decentralized alternative to traditional financial services.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Ether and Ethereum play an important role in forming and maintaining the crypto ecosystem. Ether\u2019s sustainability supports transactions, network security, and innovation within Ethereum, while Ethereum, as a platform, continues to drive the growth and broader adoption of blockchain technology. Both are interdependent and play an important role in driving the evolution of the global crypto ecosystem.\n\nRecent Trends and Future Projections\n\nThe latest trends in Ether and Ethereum can be seen from the development of Ethereum 2.0 and PoS. Development of Ethereum 2.0 itself continues, with a focus on implementing PoS to increase network efficiency and sustainability. Additionally, the DeFi sector continues to be a major trend within the Ethereum ecosystem, with the growth of projects such as lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and liquidity mining.\n\nThen, there are also Layer-2 scalability solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, which gained popularity to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges, enabling faster transactions and lower fees. Meanwhile, regarding future projections for Ether and Ethereum, with the continued development of Ethereum 2.0, future projections involve a swap from PoW to PoS, which is expected to increase network speed and efficiency.\n\nOn the other hand, the DeFi sector is also expected to continue to develop with more innovations, such as introducing more complex financial products, growing lending and borrowing protocols, and cross-chain solutions to increase interoperability. Ultimately, if Ethereum 2.0 successfully addresses scalability and transaction cost issues, then Ethereum will have the potential to play a role in revitalizing the global financial system, opening the door to greater financial inclusion and decentralized financial solutions.\n\nIntegrating blockchain and smart contracts on Ethereum could also bring major benefits to various industries, from supply chains to insurance, with the potential to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency.\n\nBuy Ethereum on INDODAX\n\nSo, now you understand what Ether (ETH) is, its role in the Ethereum ecosystem, the relationship between the two, and the latest trends and future projections for Ether.\n\nNext, if you want to buy Ethereum (ETH), you can do it at INDODAX. The following is a guide to buying Ethereum on INDODAX that you need to know:\n\nFirst, log in to your INDODAX account.\n\nThen, make a deposit (if the balance is still empty).\n\nContinue by visiting the INDODAX market, then search for Ethereum on the INDODAX market.\n\nNext, look for the trade column and enter the desired Ethereum price and balance amount. You can use the Instant method or the Limit method.\n\nAlternatively, you can immediately place a sell order at the price you determine after you have Ethereum. Make sure that the price is profitable.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ether functions as a digital asset within the Ethereum network, allowing transactions and payment of network operational fees (gas). In addition, Ether also provides incentives for miners (or validators) to keep the network secure via PoW or PoS.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum provides a platform for running smart contracts that allow the creation and execution of programming code without third-party intermediation. Ethereum is the basis for a growing DeFi ecosystem and various dApps that create decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services.\n\nUnderstanding Ether and Ethereum is important to understand the functionality and usability of the crypto ecosystem. A deep understanding of Ether and Ethereum is necessary to participate effectively in the crypto ecosystem and recognize the transformational potential they can bring to various sectors and industries in the future."

        "title": "What Is Sharding and How Does It Work? - Binance Academy",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSharding' splits a blockchain into smaller 'shards' to address the issue of scalability associated with Layer 1 networks.\n\nSharding improves transaction speeds, minimizes processing and storage costs, and enhances network performance.\n\nSharding comes with its potential drawbacks, such as network security concerns and complexity of cross-shard transactions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlockchain technology has introduced unprecedented potential in decentralization, transparency, and security. But it faces a significant challenge: scalability. Scalability is one point of the \"blockchain trilemma,\" which also includes security and decentralization. Achieving all three simultaneously is a persisting issue in the blockchain realm. This is where strategic solutions like \"sharding\" come into play.\n\nWhat Is Sharding?\n\nSharding is a concept borrowed from traditional database management. It refers to the process of splitting a larger database into smaller, more manageable parts, called shards. Its application in blockchain aims to improve scalability, whilst maintaining the principle of decentralization. In essence, sharding occurs when a blockchain network is divided into smaller parts known as shards, each capable of parallelly processing transactions and smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Sharding Work?\n\nUnderstanding how sharding is executed within a blockchain network requires a comprehension of how blockchain data is usually stored and processed. There are various ways data can be processed. We are going to look into sequential and parallel processing.\n\nTypically, each blockchain node is responsible for handling all of the transaction volume within the network. This type of data processing is commonly referred to as sequential processing. This implies that every node must maintain and store all critical information, such as account balances and transaction history. In essence, each node must process all network operations, data, and transactions.\n\nThough such a model bolsters the security of the blockchain by recording every transaction across all nodes, it dramatically slows down the processing of data. This is where parallel processing of data comes into play as it allows for multiple operations to be executed concurrently.\n\nSharding can be a potent solution to this predicament as it divides or 'partitions' the transactional workload across the blockchain network. This means that not all nodes need to manage or process the entirety of the blockchain's load.\n\nInstead, sharding segregates the workload through horizontal partitioning. In this process, the data is divided into horizontal subsets, with each shard acting as an independent database capable of processing transactions separately from the others.\n\nHorizontal vs. vertical partitioning\n\nHorizontal partitioning and vertical partitioning are two key approaches to database scaling. While both are designed to manage large data sets more effectively, they work in fundamentally different ways. Sharding is a common method of implementing horizontal partitioning.\n\nIn horizontal partitioning, the data is divided into rows and spread across different nodes (or databases), each containing a subset of the data. Each row in a table is a unique entity, so separating them doesn't lead to any loss of data integrity. A prominent example of horizontal partitioning in use is in the distribution of blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn vertical partitioning, the data is divided into columns, rather than rows. Each partition in vertical partitioning contains a subset of data for each entity, or the entire dataset, but only for a certain set of attributes. For instance, consider a customer table with columns like Name, Status, Description, and Photo. In a vertical partitioning scenario, the 'Name' and 'Status' might be kept in one table, and 'Description' and 'Photo' in another.\n\nWhy is horizontal partitioning preferred?\n\nHorizontal partitioning is generally favored over vertical partitioning in blockchain networks for three key reasons: scalability, decentralization, and security.\n\nScalability: Sharding provides a solution by breaking the data into smaller, more manageable 'shards'. Each shard can operate independently, enabling more transactions to be processed simultaneously, improving network speed and efficiency. Whereas with vertical partitioning, distributing the columns across different databases might require more complexity in retrieving a complete transaction or block information and could limit the scalability.\n\nDecentralization: In keeping with the core ethos of blockchain, horizontal partitioning supports decentralization. When nodes only have to process a portion of the total data (a shard), it allows for more nodes to participate in the network since the computational and storage burdens are reduced. Vertical partitioning, comparatively, would restrict this as each node would need access to all partitions (all columns of data) to understand and verify the complete block data.\n\nSecurity and Data Integrity: Horizontal partitioning maintains data integrity because each shard (or partition) contains complete transaction data, ensuring that each node has a full, accurate copy of its portion of the blockchain. In vertical partitioning, you'd essentially be splitting up a block's data across different nodes, making it challenging to ensure data integrity and security, a paramount aspect of blockchain networks.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Sharding?\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the potential benefits that sharding brings to blockchain technology:\n\nIncreased Transaction Speed: Sharding facilitates parallel processing of transactions. Instead of processing transactions one by one in a sequential manner, sharding allows transactions to be processed simultaneously but on different shards. Each shard works independently, thereby increasing transaction speed significantly. This not only expedites transaction speed, but it also means that the whole network can handle more users, promoting mass adoption.\n\nAn example of an existing blockchain network using shards to address scalability is Ziliqa. Ziliqa\u2019s sharding mechanism allows it to achieve thousands of transactions per second.\n\nMinimized Processing and Storage Costs: The conventional blockchain design obliges every node to store all transactions, intensifying the demands on hardware as the blockchain grows. But with sharding, each node is responsible for processing and storing just a fraction of the entire network's data\u2014this decreases the resources necessary for a node to participate in the network.\n\nAs such, more participants can join as validators, enhancing network decentralization without incurring prohibitive costs. It mitigates problems where only entities with high-end, expensive computing resources could realistically participate in the process, thus maintaining the democratized nature of blockchain networks.\n\nImproved Network Performance: Sharding can help to improve overall network performance and capacity. In the traditional blockchains, as more nodes participate in the network, the performance paradoxically decreases due to the need for increased data communication and synchronization between nodes.\n\nHowever, sharding transforms this scenario. Since each shard works separately and concurrently, the system can process more transactions and computations. When a new node joins, it can be added to a shard instead of the entire network, thus enhancing the network's capacity to scale. Efficiency is improved, leading to smoother transactions and a better user experience.\n\nRemember, future advancements and improvements in sharding technology may create other advantages, or strengthen these existing ones, enhancing the blockchain ecosystem continually.\n\nWhat Are the Limitations of Sharding?\n\nWhile sharding offers several potential benefits that could help blockchain networks become more efficient, the process also introduces a unique set of challenges. Some potential vulnerabilities introduced by sharding include:\n\nSingle Shard Takeover Attacks: In a sharding environment, the computational power to take over a single shard is dramatically less than the power required to take over the entire network. This makes these individual shards more vulnerable to a \"one-percent attack\" or \"shard takeover\" - whereby an attacker with a small amount of resources compared to the whole network can potentially take over an individual shard.\n\nCross-shard Transactions: Transactions happening across different shards (cross-shard) present a unique challenge. Cross-shard transactions are complex and could potentially lead to double-spending if not carefully managed. If one shard doesn't accurately track the state of the other shard during a transaction, users may exploit this to \"double spend\".\n\nData Availability Problems: Sharding makes maintaining the entire network state an intricate effort. If certain shards aren\u2019t available when required (because the nodes maintaining those shards are offline), it could lead to data availability issues, disrupting the entire network.\n\nNetwork Security: Sharding requires the implementation of a robust protocol that balances the load between shards. If not correctly done, this could lead to uneven distribution of data or imbalance of resources, resulting in potential network instability.\n\nNode Synchronization: Node synchronization can cause network delays due to the time it takes to share and update information across different nodes. Furthermore, if a node with slower processing capabilities or network connection lags behind, it could slow down the entire synchronization process, reducing the overall performance of the blockchain network.\n\nIs Sharding Implemented on Ethereum?\n\nEthereum has plans to implement sharding as part of their Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that aims to enhance the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the network, allowing it to process more transactions and ease congestion.\n\nAs of now, the upgrade is being implemented in phases, with the final phase (Phase 2) including the full implementation of sharding. Ethereum developers hope that these enhancements will address some of the current challenges associated with scalability and transaction cost that the network is facing.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that implementing sharding comes with its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. Therefore, Ethereum developers are putting careful thought and extensive testing into this transition to ensure the upgrade's success when fully implemented.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nOverall, sharding represents a noteworthy advance towards solving the blockchain trilemma. While it introduces new complexities and possible drawbacks, its potential for increasing scalability without compromising decentralization holds immense promise for the future of blockchain networks.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that various blockchains are exploring sharding as a potential solution. Ethereum is integrating sharding as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to address scalability issues. This implementation is expected to take place through The Cancun upgrade, a critical component of the overall enhancement plan. Nevertheless, like any other evolving technology, success will depend on ongoing research, development, and rigorous testing of sharding implementations.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in the UK - Luxury Lifestyle Magazine",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has become hot property in the UK over recent years, with everyone from seasoned professionals to complete amateurs seeking to dip their toes into the waters of trading. Despite their market\u2019s characteristic volatility, they have become seen as a means to an end by those looking to build their wealth and diversify their investment portfolios, and it is in fact because of their dramatic price swings that they have become so highly sought-after. In the early days of cryptocurrencies, the world\u2019s flagship digital asset, Bitcoin, made numerous overnight millionaires during its meteoric rise from obscurity to prominence, and since then, we\u2019ve seen plenty of other investors build millions by trading Bitcoin, Ethereum\u2019s Ether, and other popular.\n\nWhilst these days it couldn\u2019t be easier to convert 1 ETH to USD or Bitcoin to British pounds sterling, as the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment becomes more widespread, it\u2019s becoming more appealing than ever to retain crypto fortunes in their original format. It\u2019s now possible to pay for high-end hotels and holidays, luxury cars and even homes using crypto wallets, which is a sign that cryptocurrency is well and truly here to stay.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to begin your trading journey and start amassing some digital coins with the hopes of building long-term wealth, then here\u2019s how you can buy Bitcoin, Ether and other alt coins of note in the UK.\n\nIs it legal to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the UK?\n\nThe good news is that although some countries do have restrictions on buying cryptocurrencies, in the UK, it\u2019s perfectly legal to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other comparable digital coins, and there\u2019s a well-defined regulatory framework in place. This does mean that like all other income, cryptocurrencies are legally considered to be taxable assets, which means holders must report their assets and pay their dues to His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) each year to ensure full compliance.\n\nCryptocurrency has become hot property in the UK over recent years, with everyone from seasoned professionals to complete amateurs seeking to dip their toes into the waters of trading\n\nCryptocurrencies aren\u2019t, however, recognised as legal tender in the UK in the way that the British pound is.\n\nWhy you need a crypto wallet\n\nOne of the crucial measures to put in place before you delve into investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum is to ensure you have an account set up with a crypto exchange, and a secure crypto wallet ready to go. When starting out, there\u2019s nothing wrong with leaving small amounts as holdings on your account, once you start to amass larger amounts of tokens you\u2019ll want to ensure you have somewhere safe to store them. A cold crypto wallet will give you more control over your funds and full autonomy when it comes to controlling them by safeguarding the private keys needed to access it and to authorise transactions.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the UK\n\nOne of the easiest ways to purchase cryptocurrencies in the UK is via a crypto exchange, but with such a wide variety to choose from, it\u2019s wise to shop around first. Exchanges operate without formal regulation, but registration is required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), so be sure to choose an exchange that plays by the rules as there are still some that don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that not all exchanges will offer all cryptocurrencies, so check that yours has Bitcoin and Ether available to purchase before signing up. You\u2019ll also want to ensure that there\u2019s substantial daily trading volume in these to make your own trading transactions easier, and be sure to take any fees into account, as these can affect your returns.\n\nAnother option is to go with a broker like Kraken, which offers a user-friendly interface and makes the trading process simpler, which is great if you\u2019re just starting out. Some also offer the chance to try out some moves via a dummy account before you start making real time trades, which can be a handy way to learn the ropes and gain a thorough understanding of how the market works before risking real capital.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to purchase cryptocurrencies in the UK is via a crypto exchange, but with such a wide variety to choose from, it\u2019s wise to shop around first\n\nIf, however, you\u2019re keen to keep your accumulated crypto funds in a cold crypto wallet, which is offline, brokers do not always allow this, so it\u2019s something to bear in mind when deciding whether to go with a broker or an exchange.\n\nPlacing your first order\n\nThere are various ways to fund your brokerage or exchange account so that you can start buying crypto. One of the easiest ways is by linking your bank account, but you can also make payments via debit or credit card. You\u2019ll need to submit an identification document before you\u2019re able to trade, which can mean that you\u2019re not able to make your first purchase immediately, but verification rarely takes more than a couple of days.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to go, you can place an order for Bitcoin or Ether by entering the desired amount in pounds, and you\u2019ll then be able to see how much of your desired asset you can get for your money \u2013 which will often be fractional shares of large cryptocurrencies like these if you\u2019re starting small. Next, all you need to do is click the \u2018buy\u2019 button and you\u2019re off the starting block, and ready to begin your investing journey.\n\nDisclaimer: Investing money carries risk, do so at your own risk and we advise people to never invest more money than they can afford to lose and to seek professional advice before doing so."

        "title": "Ethereum Turns Deflationary With Over 106,000 ETH Burned In A Single Month - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem is back on track with its mission to ensure that Ether is deflationary following a significant increase in the burn rate. Several factors are said to have contributed to this milestone, including voluntary exits by validators.\n\nOver 106,000 ETH Burned In The Last 30 Days\n\nAccording to data from Ultra Sound Money, over 106,000 ETH have been burned in the last 30 days. In that same period, only just over 70,000 ETH have been issued. This has caused a significant decrease in Ethereum\u2019s supply, with it being down by over 35,000 ETH.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe Big Move: Crypto Pundit Predicts When Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH 9 months ago\n\nThis is a welcome development, as the disparity between the burn and issuance rate hasn\u2019t always been this obvious. That led to concerns as to whether ETH was truly deflationary or not. It also began to seem like the London Hard Fork wasn\u2019t effective. Ahead of the Merge, Ethereum introduced this upgrade in its efforts to make ETH deflationary.\n\nETH investors are sure to be delighted with the fact that the token has once again become deflationary. Such development could propel ETH\u2019s price to new heights. Moreover, it comes at a time when the market is preparing for an imminent bull run. As such, this macro factor, alongside other ones, places it at the forefront to be one of the biggest gainers.\n\nETH price recovers above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFactors That Have Contributed To The Ethereum Deflationary Status\n\nA report by Glassnode provided insights as to why Ethereum is deflationary once again. One of them happens to be the fact that the number of validators onboarded has slowed in recent weeks. Instead, Ethereum has an increasing number of validators exiting the ecosystem. This development has ultimately caused ETH issuance to slow.\n\nThis trend of exits notably began at the start of October. This seems to be when investors actually began to take full advantage of the Shanghai upgrade that had taken place in April. Before October, the exiting event is reported to have been at an average of 309 validators per day. That increased to 1018 validators per day at the start of October.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMeanwhile, the burn rate during this period is said to have increased significantly due to the growing network activity. The increase in network usage has led to higher gas fees. The daily amount of transaction fees burned through the EIP1559 protocol has also increased as a result. The accumulated fees burned between October and November are reported to have reached 5,368 ETH.\n\nEthereum is flying high at the moment, and this could be partly due to its recently achieved status. At the time of writing, the crypto token is trading at around $2,240, up by over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from CryptoTV, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) started the week in great form, with BTC soaring past $41,800 and ETH trading above $2,200.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm around these two cryptos continues to ramp up due to optimism around institutional adoption and more favorable regulation.\n\nWith altcoin season now looking imminent, all eyes are turning to hot new projects like Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), which has raised over $4.7 million ahead of its exchange debut.\n\nBitcoin Rockets Past $40k as Spot ETF Hopes Build\n\nBitcoin has reclaimed the symbolic $40,000 level for the first time since April 2022, soaring nearly 6% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThis new high marks a stellar comeback for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, now up over 151% year-to-date.\n\nFueling this impressive rise is mounting optimism that a spot Bitcoin ETF may soon be approved in the US, with over a dozen proposals pending before the SEC.\n\nMajor players like BlackRock and Grayscale have reportedly met with regulators recently to iron out details.\n\nBullish projections also support this positive narrative \u2013 with Matrixport predicting that Bitcoin will hit $60,000 by April 2024.\n\nMatrixport also forecast that BTC could top $125,000 by the end of next year, citing historical trends around Bitcoin halvings.\n\nWith the next halving set for April 2024, there\u2019s a growing belief among traders that Bitcoin could continue climbing in the coming months.\n\nEthereum Trades Above $2k as Buying Pressure Ramps Up\n\nEthereum is also riding high, trading above $2,200 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nETH has gained over 22% in the past month, buoyed by the same tailwinds boosting Bitcoin and other altcoins.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s price spike also comes as excitement builds around a possible spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US.\n\nJust last week, the SEC opened public commentary on Fidelity\u2019s proposed rule change to list a spot Ethereum ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nThe filing argues that US investors lack regulated and safe exposure to ETH, forcing them into riskier alternatives.\n\nETH\u2019s price has responded positively to this development, as investors bet an ETF greenlight could boost institutional investment in the token.\n\nMany investors point to the futures ETFs that were approved in 2021 as a precedent, suggesting that the regulatory environment may be turning more favorable.\n\nAs such, expectations are mounting that 2024 could be the year that Ethereum finally cements itself as a mainstream financial asset.\n\nTrending Bitcoin Minetrix Token Introduces Revolutionary Stake-to-Mine Concept\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum continue surging, a new altcoin is also capturing the crypto community\u2019s attention \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nThis unique project introduces the concept of Stake-to-Mine, allowing users to earn BTC rewards by staking BTCMTX tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIt represents a groundbreaking model that requires no expensive mining equipment, instead letting users earn cloud mining credits to redeem for hash power.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix has already raised over $4.7 million in its ongoing presale, demonstrating the massive interest in this project.\n\nInvestors are also being drawn to Bitcoin Minetrix due to its high staking yields, which currently exceed 127% APY.\n\nAs the first project to debut Stake-to-Mine, Bitcoin Minetrix has obtained notable endorsements from crypto influencers.\n\nFor example, YouTuber VoskCoin, who has over 617,000 subscribers, released a video review of Bitcoin Minetrix, highlighting its potential as a game-changer in the crypto mining space.\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix platform has even been audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult, which confirmed the integrity and security of its smart contracts.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin halving potentially leading to further price increases for BTC, Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Stake-to-Mine mechanism could become even more attractive to investors.\n\nDue to this, BTCMTX looks well-positioned to become a breakout star in the altcoin space as investors seek innovative ways to gain BTC exposure and tap into mining profits.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale"
