        "title": "What Is Ethereum Restaking? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum restaking, as proposed by the Ethereum-based middleware protocol EigenLayer, involves reusing staked ETH tokens to secure other protocols. Proponents of restaking believe it can be used to amplify trust across networks, while detractors are worried about its possible ramifications.\n\nRead on to learn what Ethereum restaking is, how it works, and the pros and cons of restaking ETH tokens.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nBefore we can delve into restaking, we need to understand staking digital assets in PoS networks.\n\nStaking refers to network participants locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency on-chain to secure the network in exchange for staking rewards.\n\nOn Ethereum, it means locking up 32 ETH into a validator, which acts as an economic incentive for validators to act honestly when verifying transactions. In this process, a validator commits to producing Ethereum blocks and maintains the integrity of the Ethereum network. The economic incentive for validators is earning ETH rewards.\n\nHowever, if they attempt to manipulate the network or act dishonestly, they are penalized and stand to lose their staked ETH in an act called slashing.\n\nEthereum restaking refers to simultaneously using your staked ETH to secure other protocols and earn rewards. In other words, you are depositing your already staked ether tokens in another protocol to extend the same trust generated by Ethereum\u2019s validators to the new protocol.\n\nDuring this process, your ETH will remain staked on Ethereum, and validators will continue confirming transactions, but your staking power will now expand to other protocols. Restakers will earn additional rewards for their ETH stake but will be penalized or \u201cslashed\u201d for failing to perform their staking duties.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Restaking Work?\n\nEigenLayer\n\ndeploys smart contracts on Ethereum so ETH stakers can restake their assets on external protocols. EigenLayer acts as the conduit through which you can restake your staked ETH tokens, as well as a decentralized trust marketplace for stakers looking to compound their yields.\n\nEigenLayer provides two ways to restake: native restaking or LSD restaking.\n\nNative restaking allows you to restake your ETH stake directly to EigenLayer by assigning your validator\u2019s withdrawal credentials to EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts (EigenPod).\n\nLSD restaking is you restaking your liquid-staked tokens. You can stake ETH on liquid-staking platforms such as Lido and Rocket Pool. Liquid staking is less complicated and has a lower barrier of entry than running your Ethereum validator. You can then restake your liquid-staked tokens.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nallows you to stake Lido ETH (stETH), Rocket Pool ETH (rETH), Coinbase Staked Ether (cbETH), and more liquid staked assets.\n\nHow to Restake Ethereum\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at how you can restake your ETH.\n\nSet up a Web3 wallet: Get a Web3 wallet to allow you to interact with DeFi protocols and dApps. If you have already staked ETH on liquid staking platforms, you can deposit it directly into the wallet. Connect your wallet to the EigenLayer App: Navigate to app.eigenlayer.xyz and connect your wallet to the protocol. The page will display the assets supported on EigenLayer and the TVL of each locked in the smart contracts. Select a restaking option: Choose the method of restaking that works for you. If you are a validator running your node, then native restaking is optimum. Alternatively, you can select your preferred liquid staking token and input the desired amount. Confirm your transaction: Confirm your deposit on EigenLayer and in-wallet to ensure the transaction is complete.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of Restaking Ethereum\n\nHere, we explore several benefits and drawbacks of restaking Ethereum for validators, protocols, and developers.\n\nPros\n\nAdditional rewards: The most obvious advantage of Ethereum restaking for a validator is the ability to compound staking rewards by staking ETH on other protocols.\n\nReducing the start-up cost of new protocols: By restaking Ethereum\u2019s pool of assets, new protocols can benefit economically from Ethereum\u2019s security offerings without starting their validation services.\n\nProtocols can retain sovereignty: By building on EigenLayer, protocols will have the flexibility to customize their architecture without adhering to the rigid rules imposed on Ethereum Layer 2 chains.\n\nCons\n\nSlashing: When you stake ETH, you are exposed to slashing as an economic consequence of bad behavior. Staking amplifies the risk, and you could lose staked ETH if you engage in malicious activity on a secondary protocol.\n\nRisk to Ethereum performance: Restaking opponents fear that with Ethereum\u2019s computational power being redirected to secondary networks, there could be a computational overload on Ethereum\u2019s consensus.\n\nCentralization risks: Restaking protocols like EigenLayer may attract ETH stakers with the promise of high yields, resulting in the rise of centralized networks and a decline in individual ETH stakers.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile still in its early stages, Ethereum restaking is an interesting approach to network security and validation and how users can actively contribute to both.\n\nEthereum restaking may set the precedent on how blockchain protocols incorporate the power of collective participation and pooled economic incentives to shape the future of decentralized finance."

        "title": "3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Coming Ethereum Upgrade - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH-USD) dominance as the leading smart contract and Web 3.0 platform is facing its most significant test yet. The upcoming Deneb/Cancun upgrade could once again revolutionize interest in this token. However, it\u2019s also an upgrade that comes with some element of risk. Thus, it\u2019s wise to align your portfolio to benefit from any potential impact of this upgrade, and do so in a way that limits your downside exposure.\n\nThe main feature of this upgrade is called proto-danksharding. In plain English, this scaling solution should make Ethereum layer 2 rollups much faster and cheaper to use. For those unaware, rollups move computation and data storage off the main Ethereum chain. However, these computations still retain the underlying security and decentralization Ethereum provides.\n\nProto-danksharding allows large blobs of transaction data to be stored briefly on the main chain, just long enough for validation, before getting passed along to rollups. This eliminates the need for expensive calldata that has previously congested the Ethereum network.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the upgrade could be a huge boost for many Web 3.0 projects built on smart contracts or reliant on transaction speeds, Web 3.0 assets remain highly speculative. As such, I only recommend allocating a small portion of your crypto portfolio to chase the upside in these tokens.\n\nWith that said, here are three cryptos to buy ahead of this major upgrade.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the dominant smart contract and Web 3.0 ecosystem, Ethereum has the most to gain from its ambitious Deneb/Cancun upgrade. While the upgrade aims to solve Ethereum\u2019s nagging fee issues, Vitalik Buterin has hinted that base gas costs may still rise, keeping prices high for end users. However, developers could have a field day with greatly-improved layer-2 efficiency. This might just be enough to retain developers into Ethereum\u2019s orbit, rather than losing talent to rival chains like Solana (SOL-USD) or Avalanche (AVAX-USD).\n\nI remain adamantly bullish on Ethereum heading into the upgrade event. As a deflationary cryptocurrency, growing demand for Ethereum tokens fueled by Web3 apps should drive prices higher. And with Ethereum hosting most smart contract-based platforms, demand is likely to increase over time. Deneb/Cancun will be a definitive test of Ethereum\u2019s technical prowess and its ability to meet user needs.\n\nBeyond the upgrade, there are some promising emergent use cases that could propel Ethereum adoption. Decentralized finance (DeFi) retains strong activity, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are on the rise, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming digital ownership and asset provenance, and even central banks are experimenting with the prospect of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on Ethereum. As both a crypto asset and a decentralized network powering Web3, Ethereum remains a top long-term buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimism (OP-USD)\n\nCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. Cryptos to Buy Before the Market Swing. rising meme cryptos. altcoins\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock\n\nAs a leading layer-2 scaling solution utilizing optimistic rollups for Ethereum, Optimism (OP-USD) checks all the boxes as a top Deneb/Cancun speculative buy. The project aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum dApps like decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and social networks.\n\nImportantly, Optimism is EVM-compatible, meaning developers can deploy existing smart contracts on Optimism with minimal effort. While the network is currently live, supporting prominent apps like Uniswap (UNI-USD), Synthetix (SNX-USD), and Chainlink (LINK-USD), wider usage has been hampered by throughput constraints. This could change in a big way once Optimism leverages proto-danksharding and blobs to enhance its rollups.\n\nOptimism offers an encouraging early sign of its upgrade readiness. Its team recently implemented the Ecotone hard fork on the Optimism Goerli test network. This hard fork trial enabled batch submission via EIP-4844 blobs, verifying that Optimism will hit the ground running with blob support on mainnet post-upgrade.\n\nWith strong fundamentals and a 25% market share of total value locked in layer-2 platforms at over $5.4 billion, Optimism looks poised to capitalize on the greater efficiency unlocked by Deneb/Cancun. As rollup activity expands, Optimism could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Ethereum\u2019s push to scale.\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD)\n\nA close-up shot of the concept for a cryptocurrency exchange page. Cryptos to Sell Before a Recession\n\nSource: PixieMe / Shutterstock.com\n\n0xGasless (0XGAS-USD) is a Web 3.0 project focused squarely on expanding Ethereum\u2019s addressable market by eliminating gas fees. It\u2019s a great choice for investors seeking outsized upside from higher Ethereum transaction volumes after the upgrade.\n\nAt the core of 0xGasless\u2019 offering is support for ERC-4337 and account abstraction. This is a standard that replaces traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) with smart contract wallets. These wallets feature built-in logic for transaction validation, authorization, and, crucially \u2013 gas payment. This shields users from managing seed phrases, paying volatile gas fees directly and losing funds to theft or mistakes.\n\n0xGasless also offers intriguing functionality that could hasten mainstream adoption. For example, users can deploy ERC-4337 smart contract wallets on the user-friendly Telegram platform. Additionally, a custom paymaster service enables gas fee payment using any ERC-20 token.\n\nProjects like 0xGasless building on account abstraction and user experience have asymmetric upside. The road to mass adoption starts by allowing users to easily access Ethereum applications without crypto\u2019s usual harsh learning curve.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization less than $100 million or trade with volume less than $100,000 each day.

Originally, SEC delays first caused bitcoin to flatline, before Grayscale's court victory against the regulator sent the apex token rallying at the end of 2023.\n\nEthereum has already risen around 19% since Blackrock filed for an ETF on November 16. But that's a modest gain compared to what Kendrick says could happen in May, the final deadline date for VanEck and Ark21Shares' applications.\n\nStill, to reach the $4,000 price target, some conditions will have to be met.\n\nExpectations for the approval will have to be low, as happened ahead of the bitcoin ETF launch, Kendrick said. Market-side implications for an approval will also have to miss the mark \u2014 though some may worry that the SEC's stance that ethereum should be treated as a security could get in the way, the commission has already lost that argument in court, Kendrick outlined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, a number of ETFs must be approved at the May deadline for ethereum to enjoy a boost.\n\nWhile the crypto's pre-ETF price action should resemble that of bitcoin, it's a different story once the funds are active.\n\nThough bitcoin jumped to an intra-day high of $49,000 on the ETFs' approval, it has since slid 6.7%. The surprising downside stems from massive outflows from Grayscale's fund, which previously functioned as a bitcoin trust.\n\nBut the Grayscale Ethereum Trust accounts for a much smaller market cap of the crypto than the bitcoin fund did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Grayscale ETH Trust's current market cap of USD 6bn is 2.2% of total ETH market cap, whereas the comparable share for BTC was 3.1% at the time of the ETF approval,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nAnd while the failed crypto exchange FTX led the Grayscale bitcoin selloff, its holdings in the Ethereum Trust amount to just 0.05% of the token's market cap."

        "title": "Distributed Validator Technology: Decentralizing Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "In recent years, Ethereum transitioned to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, moving away from its initial Proof-of-Work consensus. This new PoS model changes how transactions are verified on Ethereum and how new blocks are added to the network. Instead of the energy-heavy mining required in Proof-of-Work, PoS works by selecting validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to risk as security.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method is more energy-efficient and aims to improve network security and fairness in participation. However, switching to PoS introduced challenges, especially in maintaining network decentralization and ensuring secure validation. For example, security is a paramount concern in blockchain networks, especially for validators who participate in consensus mechanisms and have access to significant funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional single-node validator configurations pose a risk; if a validator's private key is compromised, it can lead to serious consequences such as slashing or loss of staked ETH.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum has introduced Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) to tackle these issues. DVT spreads out the tasks and risks related to the validation process in Ethereum's PoS system. It works by dividing and sharing a validator's key responsibilities among several entities, decreasing the chances of centralized control and eliminating single points of failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this system, a validator's private key is fragmented and distributed across a network, forming a strong cluster. These clusters work together, ensuring the complete key is never fully available on any computer. This method enhances network security and guarantees uninterrupted validation, even if some nodes in the cluster are compromised or fail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlon Muroch, Founder of the SSV.Network's core team broke it down saying, \"Distribuited-Validator-Tech (DVT) is a protocol for delegating validator operations to a group of independent operators (cluster). DVT combines 2 core technologies: a BFT consensus protocol and threshold signatures. Cluster members reach a consensus, every epoch, on what duty data to sign, and then sign it using t-of-n BLS threshold.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Each operator in a cluster holds a key share, those shares can be split from an existing validator using Shamir-Secret-Sharing or by some distributed-key-generation (DKG) protocol.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cluster members require consensus before signing, removing single point of failure setups in which a hacked or compromised service provider compromises the entire validator. DVT overcomes those challenges by using a fault tolerant consensus protocol (QBFT).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDVT's integration into Ethereum's PoS framework is crucial for a more decentralized and secure blockchain network. By reducing the risks of centralized power and enhancing the security of the validation process, DVT significantly bolsters the integrity and reliability of Ethereum's network.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt ensures that the power to validate and create new blocks is spread across a broader group of participants, not concentrated among a few. This paper will examine how DVT strengthens Ethereum's decentralization, exploring its mechanisms and impact on the future of blockchain security and integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake and the Need for Decentralization\n\nEthereum's transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was motivated by the need to improve the inefficiencies and environmental issues linked to PoW.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoS, which selects validators based on their cryptocurrency holdings and risk commitment, is more energy-efficient and accessible, reducing the heavy computational demand of PoW.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralization is a key aspect of PoS, vital for network security and resilience. Unlike PoW, where the high computational demands can lead to a few entities dominating mining power, PoS provides a fairer system for participation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralization is important in PoS to avoid any single group having too much control over the network, which helps reduce the risk of unfair tactics like the 51% attack, where someone controls most of the mining power. A decentralized network is also more robust, less prone to specific points of failure, whether technical, geographical, or political.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, achieving true decentralization in standard PoS models has its challenges. One main concern is the risk of wealth concentration, where wealthier stakeholders might have too much influence, potentially leading to a plutocracy. There's also the issue of centralization through staking pools, where smaller stakeholders combine their resources to increase their chances of being chosen as validators, unintentionally leading to a concentration of validation power.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese issues underscore the importance of systems like DVT, which aim to distribute the validation process more evenly across the network, reinforcing the decentralized nature of PoS. Addressing these obstacles, PoS systems aim to more closely adhere to the fundamental tenets of blockchain technology, striving towards an authentically decentralized and secure network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basics of Distributed Validator Technology\n\nDistributed Validator Technology (DVT) is an innovative method that transforms how blockchain networks validate transactions, especially in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake system. DVT's main goal is to boost security and promote decentralization by spreading the tasks and powers of a single validator among many nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt does this by dividing the validator's private key into parts, each handled by different nodes in the network. These nodes work together to do the jobs of a single validator, like proposing and checking blocks, without ever having the full private key in one place. This greatly lowers the risk of someone getting unauthorized access to the key.\n\n\n\n\n\nDVT relies on several critical cryptographic techniques. First is Shamir's Secret Sharing, which splits the private key into multiple pieces. Each piece is given to different nodes, and only a certain number of these pieces can put the original key back together. This setup means no single node has total control or knowledge of the private key, making the system more secure.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key part is the Threshold Signature Scheme. This scheme decides how many key pieces are needed to perform a task, like making a signature. For example, in a 3-out-of-5 setup, three of the five pieces can create a valid signature. This ensures the system keeps working even if some nodes are down or compromised, as long as enough nodes are active and working together.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Key Generation (DKG) is used to create these key pieces. It's a complex method that makes sure each participant gets a part of the key, without any single participant seeing the whole key. This step is crucial when first setting up a DVT system.\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiparty Computation (MPC) is also important in DVT. It allows multiple parties to jointly calculate something while keeping their inputs secret. In DVT, MPC helps nodes work together to make signatures, without sharing their key pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the consensus protocol in DVT is essential for making decisions in the network. It determines how nodes, each with a part of the validator's key, agree on actions like confirming blocks or approving transactions. This protocol ensures that even though the validation duties are spread out, the network runs smoothly and in sync, with all nodes aiming for the same goal. This protocol handles the usual blockchain operations and adapts to DVT's unique features, ensuring the system's distributed nature strengthens security without losing efficiency or unity.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Closer Look at Distributed Validator Technology in Ethereum's SSV Network\n\nThe SSV Network, employing Secret Shared Validator (SSV) or Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), introduces a novel method for Ethereum staking. This technology facilitates establishing a decentralized and open-source network for staking ETH.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SSV Ethereum staking network, recently rolled out its unrestricted mainnet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary function of SSV is to divide a validator key into multiple KeyShares, allowing the operation of an Ethereum validator across various non-trusting nodes. This division aims to improve the security and redundancy of validator keys, potentially impacting individual stakers, the Ethereum network, and staking services.\n\n\n\n\n\nSSV operates similarly to a multi-signature wallet with an additional consensus layer. It interfaces between a beacon node and a validator client to streamline the staking process. Its operation involves Distributed Key Generation, where operators collaboratively create a shared public and private key set. Each operator controls a private key segment, preventing total control by a single party.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe network uses the Shamir Secret Sharing method for reassembling validator keys, based on a specific threshold of KeyShares. Notably, each KeyShare alone cannot sign duties, yet the entire set is unnecessary if some are faulty, as indicated by the formula n\u22653f+1. The flexibility is enhanced through BLS signatures, enabling the combination of multiple signatures to form a validator key signature. This integration aids in the distribution and assembly of keys as required.\n\n\n\n\n\nSSV incorporates Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to secure KeyShares distribution among operators and decentralized computation of validator duties. This process ensures that the validator key is not reconstructed on a single device. To reach a network-wide consensus, even when certain operators are offline or malfunctioning, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) Consensus process is employed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SSV Network ecosystem consists of stakers, operators, and DAO members. Stakers, including individual ETH holders or services, utilize SSV/DVT technology to enhance the security and decentralization of their validators, compensating operators with SSV tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperators provide hardware support and manage the SSV protocol, ensuring the network remains robust and functional. The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) plays a significant role in governing the SSV Network protocol and managing its treasury, with decisions made through governance functions and token holder votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe native token of the SSV Network, $SSV, is primarily used for payments and governance. Stakers pay operators $SSV; the token also enables participation in network decision-making. As more ETH is staked, operators and the DAO's treasury receive higher fees, potentially creating a cycle promoting network growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuroch said, \"Such an important public good like DVT needs to have the right governance to ensure it's aligned with the greater ethereum ethos. An active and prominent DAO empowers the ssv community to make decisions and drive innovation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ssv DAO decides everything that happens within the ssv protocol: protocol params, contract upgrades, resource allocation and more.\n\nWe believe that a powerful DAO must be the driving force for ssv to serve ethereum and help make it more secure and decentralized.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDiva's Approach to Distributed Validator Technology\n\nDiva, an Ethereum Liquid Staking protocol, utilizes Distributed Validator Technology to enhance Ethereum's Proof of Stake system. It introduces novel features for two types of participants: Liquid Stakers and Operators.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquid Stakers interact with Diva by depositing Ethereum (ETH). In return, they receive divETH, a unique Liquid Staking Token. This token represents the initial ETH stake and accumulates Ethereum Staking Rewards over time. The distinct aspect of divETH is its liquidity; unlike traditional staking where assets are locked, divETH can be freely transferred or traded, maintaining its value and rewards.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, divETH is dynamic, with its balance regularly updating to reflect accrued rewards or penalties. This token also has versatility in the DeFi ecosystem, as it's an ERC20 token and can be used for various purposes like lending or bridging. For those who prefer a stable balance, divETH can be converted into wdivETH.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperators in the Diva ecosystem have a different role. They run nodes that are essential for the network's validation process, staking their divETH as collateral. This collateral secures the network and entitles them to Operator Rewards, supplementing the standard Staking Rewards that divETH generates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system incentivizes Operators to perform their duties correctly; because if they fail to do so, it can lead to penalties on their collateral. The more divETH an Operator stakes, the greater their potential rewards, as they can receive more Key Shares, which are crucial for the validation process.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets Diva apart, particularly for Operators, is its non-custodial approach. Operators never handle the actual funds or private keys. Instead, the Diva Smart Contract acts as a mediator, handling ETH deposits and setting up validators within Ethereum's Consensus Layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA unique feature of Diva is its use of Distributed Key Generation and Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham (BLS) threshold signatures, ensuring secure and decentralized validation. Each Ethereum validator in this system is controlled by multiple Key Shares, distributed among various Operators. A consensus of two-thirds of these Key Shares is necessary for any validator action, ensuring reliability and security.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiva's architecture offers a more accessible and flexible staking option than traditional Ethereum staking. While Ethereum requires a significant commitment of 32 ETH and the operation of a node, Diva allows Liquid Stakers to stake any amount of ETH without running a node.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperators, on the other hand, can lock smaller amounts of divETH and still participate in node operation, often finding it more advantageous than operating a solo Ethereum validator. This approach simplifies the staking process and aggregates rewards from the entire network, leading to smoother and more predictable returns for all participants.\n\nHow Lido Utilized DVT\n\nLido's project involving Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a bit like a big experiment in teamwork for computers that handle cryptocurrency transactions, specifically Ethereum. They worked with a group called the SSV Network from April to July to test this out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe involvement extended beyond Lido's existing Node Operators to include solo stakers, community stakers, and various professional organizations. This diversity of participants is crucial for a robust test of the DVT system.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine a group of people (or in this case, computers) who need to agree on something before taking action. In Lido's test, they created teams, or \"clusters,\" each with a different number of members. Some teams needed most members to agree before acting, while others required nearly all members to agree.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach team had a leader responsible for organizing things and ensuring everyone was ready to work together. These teams comprised different types of participants \u2013 some were experienced with Lido's system, while others were new and came from the wider community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main task for these teams was to handle Ethereum transactions. They had to set up their systems following specific instructions and then work together to process transactions. Despite some initial challenges, most teams did well, showing they could handle transactions reliably and quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results were encouraging. After fixing some early problems, the teams worked better, showing that this method could be reliable in the long run. Lido plans to improve this system and eventually use it in the real world, not just in tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey want to make the process more secure and efficient and invite more people to join in future tests. This could lead to changes in how Ethereum transactions are handled, making the process more decentralized \u2013 not controlled by just one computer or a small group.\n\nDVT in the Broader Context of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\n\nDistributed Validator Technology (DVT) offers a notable departure from traditional validator models in blockchain networks, representing a significant advancement in blockchain security and decentralization. In many blockchain systems, especially those using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, individual nodes or a small group of nodes often handle validation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these conventional models are somewhat effective, they tend to concentrate power and responsibility in a few hands, leading to potential centralization issues. This concentration can create security risks and uneven distribution of rewards and governance influence. DVT changes this by spreading the validator's duties across several nodes, diluting the influence of any single validator and leading to a more democratic, decentralized network. This approach improves security by minimizing failure points and creates a fairer system with wider participation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation and success of DVT in Ethereum could profoundly impact other cryptocurrencies and the future of blockchain technology. As blockchain networks grow and need to become more secure, efficient, and decentralized, DVT offers a model for enhancing these aspects. Its adoption might inspire new blockchain innovations, leading to more advanced, secure decentralized systems. The principles and methods of DVT could be adapted in various ways across different blockchain designs, possibly setting a new standard for validator operations in the broader blockchain field.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wider implications of DVT for the cryptocurrency ecosystem and stakeholder trust are significant. In a field where trust is crucial and concerns about centralization and security are common, DVT presents a practical solution to some key issues. By promoting a more decentralized and secure validation process, DVT boosts the overall trustworthiness of the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can increase confidence among stakeholders, not just in Ethereum but across the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Knowing that they are part of a securely and fairly managed system is invaluable for users, investors, and developers. This increased trust and security could lead to broader adoption, more innovation, and a stronger, more resilient cryptocurrency ecosystem. Therefore, DVT is more than a technological advance; it marks a critical step in the growth and development of the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.\n\n\n\n"

Discover SCENE\n\nToken trading on Solana decentralized exchanges briefly flipped that of Ethereum exchanges in December as meme coin mania raged, and now it\u2019s happened again\u2014this time ascribed to an impending token airdrop.\n\nAs of Sunday night, rolling 24-hour trading volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXes) topped Ethereum exchanges, according to data from DeFi Llama, with about $705 million on Solana during the span compared to $698 million on Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is back on top as of this writing, but the networks remain close: DeFi Llama shows about $742 million in Ethereum DEX trading over the last 24 hours, while Solana remains steady right around $705 million. Ethereum is well ahead in terms of seven-day volume, however, at $8.9 billion compared to less than $4.5 billion for Solana.\n\nEven so, the recent short-lived reversals show that the long-dominant Ethereum is facing increasing pressure from Solana, as the rival chain offers much cheaper and faster transactions. That was the case in December when trading on Solana meme coins like BONK and Dogwifhat (WIF) helped spike DEX volume.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, the culprit appears to be the impending launch of JUP, the official token of the popular Solana decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter. It\u2019s set to debut on Wednesday with nearly a million wallets eligible to claim a share of JUP tokens.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, Solana trading volume on Jupiter topped that of leading Ethereum DEX Uniswap V3 late Sunday, though much like with the broader chains, those places have already swapped as of Monday morning.\n\nUniswap V3 has over $629 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours, while Jupiter has about $571 million in DEX trading on Solana during that span.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether any recent trading will actually factor into Jupiter airdrop eligibility, however, as the protocol took a snapshot of early users on November 2. It said that some 955,000 wallets would be eligible for the eventual drop, which is now set to take place on Wednesday. However, Jupiter has additional tokens planned for future airdrops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJupiter\u2019s launchpad was used for last week\u2019s WEN meme coin drop as a test run ahead of the JUP drop. More than a million wallets were eligible for the WEN airdrop, though the claim only lasted until Monday morning\u2014with over 280 billion WEN left unclaimed.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Essentially, it will allow DNS records to be verified via an off-chain gateway and eliminate the gas fee.\n\nThis means you can use your real domain names in the ENS ecosystem for free.\n\nDomain name owners will need to enable DNSSEC and add a TXT record, but will no longer have to pay gas fees."

        "content": "Sei Labs is rolling out an upgrade that it hopes will attract Ethereum developers.\n\nHowever, it is not the only layer 1 competing in the crowded market.\n\nSei Labs, the company behind the layer 1 blockchain Sei, is betting on its Sei v2 upgrade to attract developers and remove barriers for those looking to deploy DeFi protocols on its blockchain.\n\nIt will allow developers to deploy protocols from Ethereum \u2014 the biggest blockchain ecosystem with over $57 billion worth of DeFi deposits \u2014 on Sei without having to reconfigure their code.\n\n\u201cGoing to a new execution environment is very risky,\u201d Sei co-founder Jay Jog told DL News. \u201cIf you don\u2019t completely understand it, and you create even one small, tiny bug, that could result in your entire smart contract getting completely drained.\u201d\n\nInvestor deposits ($) in Sei, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nSei v2 is scheduled to go live in the first half of 2024 and will remove that risk for developers, Jog said.\n\nSei Labs is betting that Ethereum developers will opt to build on faster blockchains like Sei as the industry is growing more focused on interoperability, referring to the push to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems.\n\nTapping into Ethereum\n\nEthereum is currently where the vast majority of blockchain development takes place. A recent report from Electric Capital found that 71% of smart contract code was initially deployed on Ethereum.\n\nAlthough Ethereum is the birthplace for the majority of blockchain code, developers also frequently opt to deploy their projects on alternative blockchains that boast higher speeds and reduced transaction fees.\n\nBlockchains like Solana or Cardano have had a hard time attracting Ethereum developers because they use software that is incompatible with Ethereum\u2019s. Solana uses its own custom-made solution, while Cardano uses a UTXO model.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis has created an opportunity for Sei and similar projects looking to court Ethereum devs.\n\nNeon EVM, an Ethereum-compatible layer 2 blockchain built on top of Solana, and Monad, a yet-to-be-launched blockchain, also offer Ethereum developers routes to deploy their code on a more performant blockchain without having to make alterations to it.\n\n\u2018The EVM is here to stay\u2019\n\nCurrently, blockchains fall into one of two broad categories: those that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2014 or EVM for short \u2014 and those that are not.\n\nEVM-compatible blockchains make it easy for Ethereum developers to build on them, but many of those chains are prone to transaction congestion and high fees.\n\nWhile some EVM-compatible blockchains find a way around this using technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, such blockchains are still relatively new.\n\nOn the other hand, blockchains that use different software, like Sei and Solana, can achieve much higher transaction speeds.\n\nSei\u2019s answer to this situation is to upgrade its current architecture to make it fully compatible with Ethereum \u2014 a request that\u2019s at the top of developers\u2019 wishlist, Jog said.\n\n\u201cThe EVM is here to stay,\u201d Jog said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the cleanest and most elegant execution environment to be using, but it is the one that has already gotten most market share.\u201d\n\nSei currently requires developers to write their protocols using programming languages like Rust or C++. But after the Sei v2 upgrade, they will be able to use languages like Solidity and Vyper that are popular with Ethereum developers.\n\nEVM parallelisation\n\nSei already achieves high transaction speeds compared to other blockchains. To maintain these high speeds while also letting developers use the EVM, Sei is implementing a technique called EVM Parallelisation.\n\nThis allows Sei to run multiple execution environments that can simultaneously process transactions instead of having to process transactions one after the other, as most blockchains do.\n\nSei is not the only blockchain leveraging EVM Parallelisation.\n\nNeon EVM also uses EVM Parallelisation to let Ethereum developers tap into Solana.\n\nInvestors deposits ($) in Neon, as measured by total value locked on DefiLlama\n\nBut unlike Sei v2, where both EVM and non-EVM protocols will live on the same blockchain, Neon EVM is its own separate blockchain.\n\nThat means users must first bridge their assets to Neon EVM, introducing a point of friction, which hasn\u2019t prevented Neon from making inroads with Ethereum developers.\n\nStiff competition\n\nAave, the biggest lending protocol on Ethereum with over $7 billion worth of investor deposits, recently polled its token holders on whether it should deploy its v3 version to Neon EVM. The vote ended with over 83% of token holders signalling support.\n\nMonad, a soon-to-be-launched blockchain, is also promising developers EVM compatibility and fast transactions.\n\nBoasting a proprietary consensus algorithm, Monad claims it will achieve processing capabilities of up to 10,000 transactions per second upon its launch later this year.\n\nAlthough Neon EVM has a head start, the competition between these three EVM Parallelisation projects is only just beginning.\n\nSEI token price ($)\n\nSuccess isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018if you build it, they will come,\u2019\u201d Jog said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s been dozens of other chains where no one has gone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Sei Labs\u2019 focus on parallelisation, the Sei Foundation, an affiliated nonprofit that supports the Sei ecosystem, plans to launch a grants programme for those looking to develop on the Sei blockchain."

Meanwhile, The Ethereum insider believed Lubin was a sociopath, which was a major reason he left him after starting ConsenSys.\n\nGiving further insights into his time working with Vitalik and Lubin, the former Ethereum advisor mentioned that he started getting \u201cbad vibes,\u201d especially when he was reviewing the \u201centire organization to save it.\u201d This was what reportedly prompted him to keep a record of everything, including key conversations.\n\nNerayoff wasn\u2019t on the technical side, so he said that he didn\u2019t have \u201cconcrete info\u201d on what was going on in the Ethereum ecosystem then. However, that has changed, as he claims that, due to his research and having to defend himself in court, he is well aware of what Vitalik and Lubin have done. By trying to take him out, \u201cthey created their worst nightmare,\u201d Nerayoff said.\n\nETH price above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nHow Ethereum Founders Created Their Worst Nightmare\n\nNerayoff alleged that Vitalik and Lubin had tried to imprison him for helping them. Nerayoff is known to have been charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) for extortion, although it was later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence. As such, he seemed to have been suggesting that Vitalik and Lubin had a hand in the legal ordeal he went through.\n\nThis could explain why the former Ethereum advisor is on a mission to get justice and see that the Ethereum founders are brought to book. Before now, Nerayoff had threatened to expose \u201ccriminals on a magnitude that is unprecedented.\u201d Then, his remarks suggested that Vitalik Buterin was one of the criminals he was referring to.\n\nIn a more recent statement, Nerayoff highlighted how Vitalik had obtained a Montenegro passport, noting that the country happens to be one of the foremost non-extradition countries. Nerayoff promises that he will soon reveal all the evidence he has against the Ethereum founders.\n\nDespite all the allegations Nerayoff has made, neither Vitalik nor Lubin has yet to come out to deny them. The Ethereum insider stated that this just proves their guilt, as they would have come out to defend themselves if they weren\u2019t.\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"

TD Cowen argued that approval is unlikely, stating:\n\n\u201c[The SEC] can eventually reject the rule change, which either will lead to a new application or litigation \u2026 Either will take another year or two to play out.\u201d\n\nIn that event, any possible spot Ethereum ETF approval is unlikely to occur until late 2025 or early 2026, the research group said.\n\nThe SEC must reach a decision on VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application by May 23 but is not required to approve the fund. The securities agency is expected to reach a decision on similar applications at the same time.\n\nOther sources are divided on whether a May approval is likely. One Polymarket prediction market suggests 47% odds of approval, while one JP Morgan executive has suggested a 50% chance of approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart is slightly more optimistic and has predicted a 60% chance of approval.\n\nPolitical factors are at play\n\nTD Cowen said that its low approval expectations are based on partisan attitudes toward cryptocurrency. The research group wrote:\n\n\u201cThis is a political call. We believe there is no upside for SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve a spot Ethereum ETF given how upset progressive Democrats were over the agency\u2019s approval of a spot bitcoin ETF earlier this month.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Democrat, needs support from progressives in order to advance his agenda or potentially obtain a different government position in the event that U.S. President Joe Biden wins a second term. It suggested that approving a spot ETF would involve a \u201cneedless fight\u201d and that Gensler is likely in \u201cno hurry\u201d to approve such a fund.\n\nDemocrats broadly opposed the earlier approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, as TD Cowen observed. Within the SEC, two Democratic commissioners voted against the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF while two Republicans voted in favor of approval. Gensler voted in favor of approval in spite of his Democratic party membership and his broader concerns about cryptocurrency.\n\nOutside of the SEC, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed complaints about the decision to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 12.\n\nMentioned in this article"

If approved, Ethereum ETFs would be the second domino to fall after the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, and be a boon for an industry that has undergone a prolonged bearish period.\n\nRead more: SEC Delays Decision on BlackRock\u2019s Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nUnder a section of the report entitled \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\u201d Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s crypto research, wrote that he expects \u201cpending applications for ETH U.S. spot ETFs to be approved on May 23, the final deadline for the first of the ETFs under consideration \u2014 the equivalent date to Jan. 10 for BTC ETFs.\u201d\n\nKendrick noted that if Ether follows how Bitcoin performed in the lead-up to its ETF approval, its price could hit $4,000 by late May. Ether is currently trading at around $2,370, according to CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual filings,\u201d said an SEC spokesperson when asked for comment. \u201cBroadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR. Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\u201d\n\nStill, the SEC postponing decisions on two ETH ETFs (BlackRock and Fidelity) on Jan. 24 follows the same pattern as its deliberative process when it came to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t seem to agree with Kendrick, however, with a wide range of opinions about whether Ethereum ETFs will even be approved at all.\n\n\u201cBased on market commentary, we believe approval expectations are relatively low, likely below 50%,\u201d wrote Kendrick. Yet, he believes the market is wrong in this case."

Proto-danksharding is designed to reduce transaction costs for layer-2 blockchains, making data availability cheaper while also addressing scalability issues. This latest upgrade lays the groundwork for full \u201cdanksharding,\u201d which takes cost reductions and performance gains even further.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDencun, after full implementation, will allow the Ethereum network to more cheaply handle more than 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe last of three testnet deployments, called Holesky, is scheduled to implement Dencun on February 7. After this test is completed, a date for Dencun\u2019s activation on the main Ethereum blockchain will be set.\n\n\u201cDanksharding is how Ethereum becomes a truly scalable blockchain, but there are several protocol upgrades required to get there,\u201d an Ethereum developer wrote on the official Ethereum website. \u201cProto-Danksharding is an intermediate step along the way.\u201d\n\nThe Dencun upgrade also introduces \u2018blobs,\u2019 which are intended to reduce rollup cost on the Ethereum mainnet by first compressing transaction data off-chain, decreasing the storage and processing load.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nData temporarily stored in blobs is only needed for a short time to verify transactions and can be safely deleted to avoid overloading the network.

AI agents are going to start doing a lot of things in our economy, and for AI agents to coordinate with incentive systems, they\u2019re probably going to use crypto.\u201d\n\nLonsdale, who also works as a founding partner at the venture capital fund 8VC, says those AI agents will probably use Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), and he thinks the price of those three crypto assets are correlated.\n\nThe Palantir co-founder also says crypto prices could soar if the US government continues spending money at prolific rates and inflation kicks back up in 2025 or 2026.\n\nDavid Marcus, the former president of PayPal and ex-Facebook vice-president, echoes Lonsdale\u2019s insight on BTC and AI. Marcus says he sees Bitcoin becoming the currency of choice for AI agents looking to trade information.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance Bitcoin sats will become the 24/7 default neutral, native value exchange asset for AI agents. Agents will net settle in real time on Lightning between them. When fiat payouts need to happen, sats will get converted for a tiny fee.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $43,571 at time of writing.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors and enthusiasts are constantly seeking alternatives to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. Ethereum's dominance in the decentralised finance (DeFi) and smart contract space has spurred the development of numerous projects aiming to offer similar functionalities at a fraction of the cost. In this comprehensive article, we delve into six Ethereum alternatives currently priced at $2 or less: Retik Finance, AltLayer, Pyth Network, Xai, Ondo, and Stellar.Retik Finance emerges as a disruptive force in the realm of decentralised finance, offering a comprehensive ecosystem of financial products and services built on blockchain technology. At its core lies Retik Pay, a revolutionary crypto-payment processor designed to streamline online transactions for merchants and consumers alike. Retik Pay revolutionises the traditional payment landscape by offering merchants the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments with minimal transaction fees, thereby enhancing their profit margins and expanding their customer base globally. The platform's seamless integration of various cryptocurrencies ensures compatibility with a wide range of digital assets, catering to the diverse needs of users across the globe. Furthermore, Retik Finance's native token, $RETIK, serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, governance mechanisms, and incentives for users. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, $RETIK plays a pivotal role in driving user engagement and fostering a thriving community within the Retik Finance ecosystem. The platform's success is evident in its rapid growth and adoption. Retik Finance has successfully sold out six presale stages, with the seventh stage currently 86.71% complete within just two days of its commencement. This remarkable momentum underscores the increasing recognition and adoption of Retik Finance within the crypto community. Moreover, experts project significant growth potential for Retik Finance, with forecasts suggesting a surge of over 5000% in 2024. With its Certik audit certification, presence on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, and successful presale stages, Retik Finance stands poised to redefine decentralised finance in the years to come. As the platform continues to innovate and expand its offerings, it is well-positioned to emerge as a leading Ethereum alternative in terms of utility and adoption.AltLayer distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency landscape with its innovative Restaked Rollups, offering a decentralised protocol aimed at scaling Ethereum and other blockchains. This solution targets critical challenges like security, decentralisation, interoperability, and transaction finality, setting it apart from existing scaling solutions. The recent surge in ALT's price is attributed to its listing on major exchanges such as Bitget and Binance, boosting exposure and liquidity. With a market cap around $300 million, AltLayer shows significant growth potential in the current bull market. Moreover, AltLayer's bounce from oversold levels on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a short-term trend reversal, bolstering investor confidence in its potential. As interest in scaling solutions grows, AltLayer is poised to carve out a prominent position in the rollups space. Exchange listings, technological potential, and oversold conditions have fueled AltLayer\u2019s recent price surge. With ongoing development and the potential to emerge as a leading Ethereum alternative trading below $2 at $0.34 and is up 9% in the last 24 hours, while experts foresee significant growth ahead.Pyth Network has emerged as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, offering a price aggregator oracle that furnishes valuable market insights and enables seamless token distributions. Since its inception in November 2023, Pyth Network has swiftly gained momentum, achieving a notable market value of $540 million. Currently trading at $0.4033, Pyth Network showcases robust potential for growth, with forecasts projecting a rise to $2.89 by 2025. However, investors should exercise caution when considering these predictions, given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and the unpredictable nature of market dynamics. The trajectory of Pyth Network's success hinges on the adoption of its data feeds and the overall progress of the crypto finance sector. With its distinctive features and expanding influence, Pyth Network remains an appealing Ethereum alternative for investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning Oracle market. Amid the ever-fluctuating crypto landscape, Pyth Network (PYTH) stands apart with its unique attributes and promising price predictions. However, prudent consideration is advised due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. The future success of Pyth Network (PYTH) is intrinsically linked to the adoption of its data feeds and the ongoing evolution of the crypto finance sector. Positioned as an Ethereum alternative priced below $2, PYTH holds promise for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.Xai revolutionises the gaming industry by enabling average players to own and trade in-game items without the need for crypto wallets. With its solid utility and practical application for millions of gamers worldwide, Xai transcends traditional speculative digital currencies, offering tangible value to its user base. Trading below $2 at $0.737, Xai exhibits bullish growth potential in the coming weeks, driven by its innovative approach and widespread adoption within the gaming niche of the low-cap crypto market. However, the inherent volatility of the crypto market introduces some uncertainty, necessitating careful consideration of risk factors by potential investors. As Xai continues to attract regular gamers and accelerate its growth trajectory, the project is poised to make significant inroads in the gaming industry, further solidifying its position as a viable Ethereum alternative for investors seeking exposure to innovative blockchain solutions.Ondo Finance emerges as a trending DeFi protocol, offering a native token and expanding its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. With its focus on digitising real assets and fostering financial inclusion, Ondo Finance demonstrates considerable growth potential in the evolving digital finance sector. Trading below $2 at $0.2149, Ondo Finance is supported by strong technical fundamentals and price predictions suggesting an increase to $0.53 this year and $0.61 the next. However, regulatory developments and market volatility pose potential challenges to Ondo's price trajectory, highlighting the importance of risk management for investors. As Ondo Finance continues to execute its vision and gain traction in key markets, the project is poised to play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralised finance. With its emphasis on innovation and accessibility, Ondo Finance represents a compelling Ethereum alternative for investors seeking exposure to emerging DeFi opportunities.Stellar (XLM) is on the brink of a transformative shift with the imminent launch of its Protocol 20 upgrade, heralding the integration of smart contracts into its mainnet. The announcement of the validator vote scheduled for January 30, 2024, has injected fresh momentum into XLM's market performance, propelling its price upward in the past 24 hours. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has been diligently advancing towards this milestone, marking a significant leap forward in Stellar's evolution. Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director at SDF, underscores the profound impact of Soroban smart contracts, framing them as the bedrock of a more inclusive future for the Stellar ecosystem. As anticipation builds within the XLM community, Stellar emerges as a compelling alternative to Ethereum, particularly given its affordability, with prices currently below $2 at $0.1139 as of writing, making it an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to smart contract functionality without the hefty price tag associated with other platforms. With Protocol 20 poised for implementation, Stellar stands at the precipice of broader adoption and enhanced utility, positioning itself as a formidable contender in the ever-expanding landscape of blockchain technology. As the countdown to the pivotal vote continues, enthusiasm abounds, signalling a promising trajectory for Stellar and its community of supporters.In conclusion, Retik Finance, AltLayer, Pyth Network, Xai, Ondo, and Stellar stand out as six promising Ethereum alternatives currently priced at $2 or less. Each project offers unique value propositions and innovative solutions to address various challenges in the cryptocurrency landscape. As investors navigate the dynamic crypto market, careful consideration of each project's fundamentals, market dynamics, and growth potential is essential to making informed investment decisions. While opportunities for substantial returns exist, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence to mitigate risks and maximise returns in this evolving ecosystem of Ethereum alternatives."

        "title": "Ether Price Will Crash Hard Below $1,000, Says This Popular Analyst - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBenjamin Cowen, a popular cryptocurrency trader-cum-analyst, has suggested that the price of Ethereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) could experience further declines before finding a local bottom. Cowen expressed the possibility of ETH nosediving below the $1,000 level, attributing the potential dip to factors related to the asset\u2019s historical patterns.\n\nWill ETH Really Fall Below $1K?\n\nInvestors and traders have been closely watching ether\u2019s price in recent weeks since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. The second-largest crypto set a new year-to-date high of $2,720 after the approvals, but it has since turned soft alongside the broader crypto market.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, analyst Benjamin Cowen has suggested that ETH historically \u201ctests the integrity\u201d of its major cycle lows roughly two times before proceeding into a new bullish phase. Cowen specifically spotlights 2015, 2016, and 2020 and confirms that another low in 2022 is yet to be revisited.\n\nAccording to the trader, ether will first break down in its Bitcoin confluence (ETH/BTC) in the coming months before ETH/USD follows.\n\n\u201cSo at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won\u2019t test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won\u2019t break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum,\u201d Bowen told his nearly 800,000 YouTube subscribers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that it could take some time before this scenario plays out amid increased speculation among investors about the possible introduction of a spot Ether ETF and Bitcoin\u2019s April halving event. According to experts, now that there is clarity after the Bitcoin ETFs, spot ETH ETFs may come sooner than expected.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs Aren\u2019t Far Away\n\nAs ZyCrypto previously covered, multiple companies including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest are seeking regulatory approval to set up spot ether exchange-traded funds. However, the SEC recently delayed the verdict for these investment products.\n\nAlthough such delays could subsequently delay a parabolic ETH rally, the SEC\u2019s approval ultimately will propel the price of the asset to new heights. With spot ETH ETFs, U.S. investors will access a regulated, tax-advantaged way of gaining exposure to the industry\u2019s second-biggest crypto.\n\nBesides the potential ETF, technical developments within the Ethereum ecosystem could also propel the ETH price. Notably, ETH devs recently set the timeline for the final Dencun testnet upgrades. Dencun will be run through the Sepolia test network on January 30, and on the Holesky testnet on Feb.7. This puts the upgrade on track to hit the mainnet in late February or early March."

        "title": "Synonym Finance joins $22bn DeFi money market with Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism launch - DLNews",
        "content": "Synonym Financ\u2019s raison d\u2019etre is to bring together disparate crypto liquidity across distinct blockchains.\n\nDeFi lending is worth $22 billion and is DeFi\u2019s biggest sub-market, followed by decentralised exchanges.\n\nFounder says the project won\u2019t bridge to any \u201csubpar networks.\"\n\nThe founder also addressed the risk of hacks and potential airdrops.\n\nDeFi lending is a $22 billion market \u2014 almost half of DeFi\u2019s total market size \u2014 but much of that liquidity is siloed in protocols native to different blockchains.\n\nSynonym Finance launched on Tuesday and aims to solve just that.\n\nWhile the end goal is universal DeFi money market liquidity, the cross-chain protocol says it will only link to \u201chigh-quality ecosystems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are launching on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism \u2014 all extremely high-quality ecosystems,\u201d Synonym Finance\u2019s pseudonymous founder, 0xbeachball, told DL News.\n\n0xbeachball has previously contributed to LayerZero Labs, developers of the eponymous DeFi interoperability protocol and crypto lending app Notional Finance.\n\n\u201cOur thresholds for inclusion in our markets are extremely high \u2014 we won\u2019t be connecting to subpar networks.\u201d \u2014 0xbeachball, Synonym Finance co-founder\n\nEthereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism\u2019s lending market size is $11.9 billion, more than half of the DeFi lending market. The bulk of that sum is on Ethereum.\n\nThose three blockchains are also EVM networks. EVM stands for \u201cEthereum virtual machine\u201d and describes a class of blockchains that use a smart contract logic similar to Ethereum\u2019s.\n\n0xbeachball, however, added that support for Solana is in the works.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis would let users secure loans with collateral on EVM chains and deliver USDC liquidity into DeFi protocols on Solana.\n\nWhile cross-chain lending is relatively new to DeFi, Synonym Finance isn\u2019t alone.\n\nLending giants like Aave and Compound have already launched new versions allowing cross-chain lending \u2014 borrowing crypto on one blockchain for collateral posted on a different network.\n\nUSDC gets the nod\n\nFor Synonym Finance, USDC liquidity migration is crucial to its focus on unifying DeFi liquidity. The protocol plans to achieve this goal via a bridged version of USDC called CCTP-enabled USDC.\n\nThe CCTP bridge lets users transfer tokens, in this case, USDC, across blockchains.\n\nThe USDC being sent is natively burned on the sender blockchain with an equivalent amount of USDC natively minted on the receiver blockchain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to support blue chip assets and stablecoins like USDC moving forward that can provide higher quality assurances on stability and liquidity depth,\u201d 0xbeachball said.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nWhile the bulk of developer activity has gone multi-chain, user engagement last year was still mostly transactions on a single chain, according to a recent report by crypto intelligence firm Flipside Crypto.\n\nUsers who did cross-chain transactions mostly did so to position themselves for airdrop opportunities.\n\nBut while protocols like Synonym Finance are pushing users to do more cross-chain activity, the security risks of a mult-chain world are high.\n\nSome of the industry\u2019s largest hacks have occurred via exploits on different crypto bridges.\n\nIn 2022, for instance, Chainalysis reported that $2 billion had been lost to cross-chain bridge exploits. Heco Bridge was robbed of $86 million in 2023.\n\nCross-chain money market operations put even greater focus on transaction ordering, dynamic pricing, and interest rate re-balancing, which are essential for preventing bad debt on DeFi lending positions.\n\nCrypto collateral is volatile, and price swings affect supply and demand.\n\nTrading bots also target this volatility in search of arbitrage opportunities that can be exploited for profits through specially ordered transactions on the blockchain.\n\n0xbeachball said current cross-chain lending protocol designs have failed to address these issues, but Synonym Finance has a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re built on a hub and spoke model with a hub that lives on Arbitrum,\u201d 0xbeachball said. \u201cAll rate pairs, rebalancing, and ordering takes place on the hub and is subsequently communicated to the spokes.\u201d\n\nSince all operations occur on a single hub, coordination across the entire system is easier, 0xbeachball said.\n\nNo airdrop\n\nConcerning airdrops, 0xbeachball said the project won\u2019t take the well-worn route of bootstrapping user engagement via any airdrop rewards.\n\nThe protocol will pursue liquidity by encouraging users to lock their deposits on the protocol to earn yield.\n\n\u201cFor us, early system liquidity and clear proof of the utility Synonym provides is better served by users that are engaged from day,\u201d one0xbeachball said.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate? - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.\n\nAfter a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.\n\nA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.\n\nImmediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.\n\nConversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.\n\nSolana shows strength\n\nDuring this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the \"Ethereum killer.\"\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.\n\nThe cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.\n\nOn the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.\n\nThe next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.\n\nFundamental Ethereum problems\n\nAs it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming \"unusable\" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.\n\nLayer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems."

        "title": "What happened to PayPal stablecoin PYUSD after last year\u2019s launch? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "PayPal\u2019s entrance into the stablecoin market on Aug. 7, 2023, was welcomed by many in the industry, with Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire stating that competition from PayPal was \u2018great to have.\u2019\n\nThe news of the launch led to a modest 4% rise in the price of Bitcoin, and within days, exchanges were offering low-fee promotional opportunities for traders willing to utilize PayPal\u2019s PYUSD. Before the end of August, Coinbase, Kraken, and HTX had listed the stablecoin, adding Venmo support just a month later.\n\nFive months after its launch, PYUSD has now claimed the number eight position by market cap in the global stablecoin charts, having captured the $300 million mark around Jan. 22. However, PYUSD drops to eleventh overall when ordered by volume, with just $10 million in 24-hour trade volume. This puts it only slightly ahead of UST Classic, which, with a price 98% off its originally intended $1 peg, traded just $500,000 less over the past day.\n\nStill, PayPal\u2019s PYUSD climb to $300 million in value locked in five months is impressive. In addition to an increase in market cap, the token has seen steady on-chain activity, with a modest 200 \u2013 400 transactions per day.\n\nHowever, PYUSD has yet to break into the DeFi landscape in any meaningful way, as the below table and diagram highlight. The majority of the PYUSD liquidity sits on centralized exchanges, with Crypto.com being the largest single holder of the token at $113 million, just over one-third of the total market cap.\n\nThe visualization below depicts the transactions between major entities exclusively for PYUSD. Entities with more substantial PYUSD holdings are shown larger than those with smaller amounts. The entities with no logos on the far right are unknown wallets holding above $30,000. The logos in the top right depict business entity tokens, likely treasury holdings.\n\nInterestingly, there are several connections between PYUSD issuer Paxos, Uniswap, and Curve. Yet, these entities do not then link into the major exchanges, suggesting the DeFi and CEX ecosystems for PYUSD are wholly separate.\n\nWhile PayPal was subpoenaed by the SEC when PYUSD had half the current market cap, it was reported to have complied with requests, and little has been heard on the matter since. The announcement of the filing marked the local low for PayPal\u2019s stock price also, with it rallying 24% since November.\n\nFurther, PayPal Ventures has recently started using the PYUSD stablecoin as a mechanism for strategic investments, using it for a stake in the institutional crypto platform Mesh. Amman Bhasin, Partner at PayPal Ventures, commented,\n\n\u201cAs the world of financial services undergoes rapid transformation, we believe that user ownership and portability of assets will become a critical building block of product innovation, with crypto serving as the first beachhead where this is possible.\u201d\n\nThus, while PYUSD still has some way to go to catch behemoths such as Circle and Tether, the debutant and web2 disruptor is certainly in the process of cementing its position in the industry.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "How to bridge to Arbitrum - OKX",
        "content": "Arbitrum is a popular Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution, making bridging in and out of it essential. Arbitrum uses a method called \u201coptimistic rollup,\u201d where smart contracts are executed off-chain and only the final output is posted to the Ethereum blockchain. It has a significantly larger transaction throughput, making it faster and cheaper than Ethereum. Arbitrum is also an Ethereum equivalent blockchain, making it easy for developers to move their applications from the Ethereum chain.\n\nOften, blockchains are self-contained and can't communicate with other chains. Blockchain bridges exist to address this limitation. These bridges enable users to transfer their funds between different chains easily. Cryptocurrency bridges promote interoperability among blockchains and enhance the ease of transferring digital assets. The potential of decentralized applications (DApps) lies in the ability of users to easily move from one chain to another.\n\nPreparing for bridging: wallet and asset selection\n\nChoosing the right wallet\n\nThe first step before using an Ethereum to Arbitrum bridge is to choose the right wallet.\n\nOKX provides a highly secure and multi-chain OKX Web3 Wallet with all OKX accounts. It can safely store ETH or any other cryptocurrency across multiple chains for as long as needed. Additionally, the OKX Web3 Wallet features bank-grade security and inbuilt access to hundreds of DApps and the OKX NFT Marketplace.\n\nSelecting assets for bridging\n\nTo begin with, it\u2019s necessary to confirm the asset is compatible before transferring a cryptocurrency between different chains. In this example, we'll move ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One. ETH is the only requirement since it is the native currency on both networks. It's used on both the Ethereum blockchain and Arbitrum One to cover transaction fees.\n\nTo bridge a different asset like USDT, make sure that Arbitrum supports USDT. One easy way to do this is to check the bridge. If USDT is available, you should be able to bridge it. However, also make sure you have ETH on Arbitrum to pay for gas fees after you bridge the USDT.\n\nExploring bridge services\n\nDecentralized bridge services\n\nWe suggest using OKX Swap as a reliable cross-chain bridge for transferring ETH to Arbitrum. By aggregating prices from various decentralized exchanges, OKX provides the most optimal route, reducing both slippage and network fees.\n\nArbitrum also provides its own solution, Arbitrum Bridge. However, it has a restricted range of supported cryptocurrencies and doesn't provide swapping capabilities. Other options you can check out are Meson and Stargate.\n\nCentralized bridge services\n\nAn easy way to bridge to Arbitrum is by using centralized exchanges. This involves first transferring your digital assets to OKX on a specific blockchain, then withdrawing them on a different chain like Arbitrum.\n\nThe following guide explains how to bridge ETH from the Ethereum blockchain to Arbitrum using OKX Exchange:\n\nStep 1: Create an account on OKX.\n\nStep 2: After logging in, go to the \"Assets\" section in the top-right corner and choose \"Deposit.\" If you don't have ETH, you can purchase some on OKX and bypass the deposit process.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cETH\u201d as the crypto and \u201cETH-ERC20\u201d as the deposit network.\n\nStep 4: Transfer ETH to the provided address. It may take a few minutes for the ETH to arrive in your account and become available.\n\nStep 5: After your funds are available, head back to the \"Assets\" section and choose \"Withdraw.\"\u201d\n\nStep 6: Choose \"ETH\" as the cryptocurrency and opt for \"On-chain\" as the withdrawal option.\n\nStep 7: Type in your Arbitrum address and select the network as \u201cETH-Arbitrum One.\u201d Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge to Arbitrum and hit next. After verifying your account, the ETH will be deposited into your wallet in a matter of minutes.\n\nOne convenient method for transferring your assets is through an exchange, as it removes the concern for slippage and network fees.\n\nChoosing a bridge service\n\nBoth centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency bridges are good choices. Decentralized bridges, in particular, allow for quicker movement between chains. However, they do have drawbacks, such as high fees and slippage. It's essential to prioritize security when selecting a decentralized bridge and opt for a well-established one with a proven track record.\n\nBridging process: a step-by-step guide\n\nTo bridge ETH to Arbitrum, you'll need to link your wallet to the bridge and transfer your assets. We'll be using the OKX Web3 Wallet and OKX Swap for this process, but it should be similar if you prefer to use a different wallet or bridge service.\n\nConnecting to a bridge service\n\nStep 1: Head over to OKX Swap.\n\nStep 2: Choose \"Connect wallet\" located in the upper right corner, then opt for \"OKX wallet extension\". Or, if you prefer to use a different wallet provider such as Metamask or Phantom, select \"Other\" and choose your preferred wallet.\n\nStep 3: To connect your OKX wallet and OKX Swap, enter the password for your OKX wallet, and then select \"Confirm\".\n\nTransferring assets to Arbitrum One\n\nOnce you\u2019re connected to OKX Swap, you\u2019re ready to bridge ETH to Arbitrum.\n\nStep 1: Adjust the bridge settings and specify the quantity of ETH you wish to bridge in the \"Swap & Bridge\" section.\n\nSelect \u201cEthereum\u201d as the \u201cfrom\u201d chain and type in the amount of ETH you want to bridge. Select \u201cArbitrum\u201d on the \u201cTo\u201d chain and token \u201cARB_ETH.\u201d OKX Swap will automatically show you the amount of ETH you\u2019ll get.\n\nStep 2 (optional): This step isn't required, and we recommend you only complete it if you understand slippage and bridges well.\n\nNetwork fee: This calculates the Ethereum network's cost for bridging. Slippage: Slippage refers to the level of flexibility you\u2019re willing to allow for price fluctuations. By setting the slippage to 0%, OKX swap guarantees you'll receive exactly 0.49872 ETH, as indicated. The transaction will be voided if the price fluctuates, and you'll be charged a network fee. Allowing for some slippage is important when the pool has limited liquidity. Trading route: OKX Swap isn't a bridge but rather a DeFi aggregator that automatically selects the most suitable bridge to Arbitrum for you. However, you have the option to manually change the service if wanted.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cSwap across chains.\u201d When your wallet pops up, confirm the transaction.\n\nOKX Swap is a convenient DeFi tool to get your cryptocurrencies across bridges and swap them along the way.\n\nOKX Swap and other bridges can serve as bridges between Arbitrum and ETH in both directions. To perform an Arbitrum to ETH bridge, the primary network must be selected as Arbitrum and the secondary network as Ethereum.\n\nUnderstanding fees and timelines\n\nFee structures explained\n\nThere are multiple fees involved in a decentralized bridging process:\n\nEthereum gas fees: To use OKX Swap and send your ETH, you must pay a transaction fee to the Ethereum network. Bridge fees: OKX Swap acts as a hub for connecting bridges. As part of the bridging procedure, a small charge is imposed by the bridge. Arbitrum transaction fees: Similar to the gas fee on Ethereum, a transaction fee is imposed on Arbitrum to enable the transfer of ETH from the bridge to your Arbitrum wallet. Conversion fees: There's an extra charge when you bridge between cryptocurrencies. For example, if you want to send USDT from Ethereum but want to receive ETH on Arbitrum, there willl be a fee for converting USDT to ETH.\n\nBefore the transfer, you can check the conversion and bridge charges using OKX Swap. However, the Ethereum gas fee will only be visible in the OKX Web3 Wallet pop-up when verifying the transaction.\n\nExpected transaction times\n\nJust like the fee involved, transaction time also depends on multiple factors:\n\nEthereum confirmation time: The duration it takes for ETH to move from your wallet to the bridge is dependent on the amount of gas used. With sufficient gas, the process should only take a few seconds. Bridge processing time: The duration of asset transfer between chains varies depending on the bridge being used. For OKX Swap, the trading route can be viewed in advanced options to determine its time. Arbitrum blockchain confirmation time: Once the bridging process is complete, the ETH will be sent to your wallet. With Arbitrum's efficient processing speeds, it should reach your wallet almost instantly.\n\nSecurity measures and best practices\n\nSecuring your transactions\n\nWhen using a cryptocurrency bridge, it's important to remember that you\u2019re interacting with a smart contract that can access your wallet. It's possible for malicious smart contracts to withdraw funds from your wallet without your awareness. For safer crypto transactions on bridges, we recommend the following.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re using a trustworthy bridge with a proven track record in the market. Avoid using your primary wallet to engage with bridges and other decentralized applications. Keep a separate cold wallet for storing your assets. Use tools like Revoke to block access to your wallet once bridging is complete.\n\nAn effective approach for minimizing these dangers is to use a centralized exchange for bridging purposes. As a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, OKX employs world-class security measures to protect users and allow them to buy and sell BTC safely and seamlessly. Visit our security of funds and Proof of Reserves page for more details.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls\n\nHere are some of the common pitfalls you can avoid while you\u2019re bridging your assets to Arbitrum:\n\nMake sure to review all the information you enter before submitting it. Once you confirm the transaction, there's no option to reverse it. Be mindful of the gas fees. When the Ethereum network is congested and in demand, \u200cgas fees may rise. You can either wait for the fees to decrease or use a centralized exchange to bridge. High slippage and liquidity issues are another aspect to look out for. Using a bridge that isn't well-known or bridging to a coin with low trading volume may result in significant slippage. To prevent this, use bridges for assets with abundant liquidity.\n\nTroubleshooting and support\n\nCommon bridging issues and solutions\n\nMany users struggle with transactions getting stuck due to insufficient gas fees. In congested situations, transactions may also get stuck on bridges, but they're designed to handle this and will eventually be resolved. Just be patient and wait. Cross-chain compatibility: Before bridging, make sure the asset you\u2019re using has sufficient liquidity and is compatible with the chain.\n\nWhere to find support\n\nIt\u2019s usually not difficult to find support in the crypto community should you encounter any problems.\n\nIf you have issues with OKX Swap or Exchange, visit OKX Support for FAQs and chat with the team for help. Always use official support resources and watch out for scams."

        "title": "How to bridge to Optimism - OKX",
        "content": "Optimism is a popular Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain designed to increase scalability. As a result, bridging is an essential part of using the technology. Optimism increases efficiency by processing transactions off Ethereum and periodically syncing them. This results in transaction fees and processing speed being significantly lower than Ethereum, making Optimism one of the most popular Ethereum L2 solutions.\n\nBlockchains are typically isolated systems and can't interact with other chains. The purpose of blockchain bridges is to address this issue. Through blockchain bridging, individuals can efficiently transfer their funds between different chains. These cryptocurrency bridges promote compatibility between blockchains and streamline the process of transferring digital assets. The future of decentralized applications (DApps) is multi-chain, as some chains are built for specific purposes.\n\nPreparing for bridging: wallet and asset selection\n\nChoosing the right wallet\n\nThe first step before using an Ethereum to Optimism bridge is to choose the right wallet.\n\nOKX provides a highly secure and multi-chain OKX Web3 Wallet with all OKX accounts. It can safely store BTC or any other cryptocurrency for as long as needed. In addition, the OKX Web3 Wallet features bank-grade security and inbuilt access to hundreds of DApps and the OKX NFT Marketplace .\n\nSelecting assets for bridging\n\nBefore bridging a cryptocurrency from one chain to another, the first task is to confirm that the asset is compatible. In this article, we'll be moving ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Optimism. This process only requires ETH, as it\u2019s the primary currency on both chains. On both the Ethereum blockchain and Optimism, ETH is used for covering gas fees.\n\nTo bridge a different asset like USDT, you must make sure that Optimism supports USDT. One easy way to do this is to check the bridge. If USDT is available, you should be able to bridge it. However, make sure you have ETH on Optimism to pay for gas fees after you bridge the USDT.\n\nExploring bridge services\n\nDecentralized bridge services\n\nOur top pick for a secure cross-chain bridge to transfer ETH to Optimism is OKX Swap . By collecting prices from multiple decentralized exchanges, OKX provides the most optimal path, reducing the impact of slippage and network charges.\n\nOptimism also provides its own solution, Optimism Bridge . However, this option supports a limited number of cryptocurrencies and doesn't offer swapping services. Other options you can check out are Meson and Stargate .\n\nCentralized bridge services\n\nOne simple method of connecting to Optimism is through the use of centralized exchanges. By depositing your ETH on OKX using one chain, you can then withdraw it using a different one. The following is a basic tutorial on how to bridge ETH from Ethereum to Optimism through OKX Exchange.\n\nStep 1: Create an account on OKX .\n\nStep 2: Once logged in, head to \u201cAssets\u201d on the top-right and select \u201cDeposit.\u201d If you don\u2019t have ETH, buy some on OKX and skip the deposit step.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cETH\u201d as the crypto and \u201cETH-ERC20\u201d as the deposit network.\n\nStep 4: Send ETH to the displayed address. It may take several minutes for the ETH to be credited to your account and become available for use.\n\nStep 5: Once your funds are ready to be used, go back to \u201cAssets\u201d and select \u201cWithdraw.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Select \u201cETH\u201d as Crypto and the withdrawal method as \u201cOn-chain.\u201d\n\nStep 7: Enter your Optimism address and choose \"ETH-Optimism\" as the network. Enter the amount of ETH you wish to transfer to Optimism and select next. You'll then be prompted to verify your account, and the ETH should appear in your wallet in a few minutes.\n\nUsing an exchange to connect your assets is among the simplest approaches, as you don't encounter slippage or network fees.\n\nChoosing a bridge service\n\nCentralized and decentralized cryptocurrency bridges offer different benefits. Deciding between the two depends on your preferences. Decentralized bridges allow for faster movement between chains but may have high fees and slippage. When choosing a decentralized bridge, prioritize security and choose a reputable one with a strong track record.\n\nBridging process: a step-by-step guide\n\nTo bridge ETH to Optimism, you'll need to link your wallet and send the assets. We'll execute the bridging process by using OKX Web3 wallet and OKX Swap. The steps should be similar for other wallets or bridge services.\n\nConnecting to a bridge service\n\nStep 1: Head over to OKX Swap\n\nStep 2: Select \u201cConnect wallet\u201d in the top right corner, and select \u201cOKX wallet extension.\u201d If you use another wallet provider like Metamask or Phantom, select \u201cOther\u201d and choose your wallet.\n\nStep 3: Enter your OKX wallet password and click \"Confirm\" to connect your OKX wallet and OKX Swap.\n\nTransferring assets to Optimism\n\nAfter successfully connecting to OKX Swap, you can proceed to transfer ETH to Optimism.\n\nStep 1: Adjust the bridge settings and specify the desired quantity of ETH to transfer in the \"Swap & Bridge\" section.\n\nSelect \u201cEthereum\u201d as the \u201cfrom\u201d chain and type in the amount of ETH you want to bridge. Select \u201cOptimism\u201d on the \u201cTo\u201d chain and token \u201cOP_ETH.\u201d OKX Swap will automatically show you the amount of ETH you\u2019ll get.\n\nStep 2 (optional): This is an optional step. We advise you only do this if you understand slippage and bridges very well.\n\nNetwork fee: the network fee for enabling blockchain bridging. Slippage: slippage refers to the level of flexibility you're comfortable with in relation to fluctuations in prices. By choosing a slippage of 0%, OKX swap guarantees that you'll receive exactly 0.4982 ETH, as displayed. However, if you opt for a higher slippage, the transaction will be voided, and you'll incur the network fee. Allowing for some slippage is important when dealing with pools with lower liquidity levels. Trading route: The OKX Swap isn't a bridge, but rather a DeFi aggregator that automatically selects the most suitable bridge to Optimism for you. However, you also have the option to manually change the service if you want to.\n\nStep 3: Select \u201cSwap across chains.\u201d When your wallet shows, confirm the transaction.\n\nOKX Swap is a convenient DeFi solution for transferring and exchanging your digital assets through multiple bridges.\n\nIn addition to OKX Swap, other bridges can function as bridges from Optimism to ETH. You must choose Optimism as the primary network and ETH as the secondary network.\n\nUnderstanding fees and timelines\n\nFee structures explained\n\nThere are multiple fees involved in a decentralized bridging process:\n\nEthereum gas fees : The cost of transferring your ETH from your wallet to the bridge on Ethereum. Bridge fees: OKX Swap serves as a bridge and swap aggregator, with the bridge charging a small fee for facilitating the bridging process. Optimism transaction fees: Just like the gas fee in Ethereum, an Optimism transaction fee is required for transferring ETH from the bridge to your wallet. Conversion fees: If you opt to switch cryptocurrencies during the process of bridging, there'll be an extra charge. For example, you can convert USDT on Ethereum to ETH on Optimism, but it will come with an additional fee for the conversion.\n\nBefore starting the transfer, you can view the detailed breakdown of conversion and bridge fees on OKX Swap. Keep in mind the Ethereum gas fee will only be displayed on the OKX Web3 Wallet pop-up when you confirm the transaction.\n\nExpected transaction times\n\nJust like the fee involved, transaction time also depends on multiple factors:\n\nEthereum confirmation time: The duration of transferring ETH from your wallet to the Bridge is dependent on the amount of gas used. With sufficient gas, this process should only take a few seconds. Bridge processing time: The duration of transferring assets from one chain to another varies depending on the bridge used. For OKX Swap, this information can be found by selecting the trading route in the advanced options. Optimism blockchain confirmation time: The ETH will be transferred to your Optimism wallet after the bridging process. As Optimism is known for its speed, you can expect the funds to arrive in just a few seconds.\n\nSecurity measures and best practices\n\nProviding secure transactions\n\nWhen using a Cryptocurrency bridge, keep in mind that you\u2019re engaging with a smart contract that has access to your wallet. Malicious smart contracts can be used to deplete wallet funds. To make sure your cryptocurrency transactions on bridges are safe, follow these guidelines:\n\nMake sure you\u2019re using a reputable bridge to Optimism like OKX Swap, which is well established in the market. Don't use your primary wallet for interacting with bridges and other decentralized applications. Instead, keep a separate cold wallet for storing your assets. Use tools like Revoke to remove access to your wallet once you\u2019re done bridging.\n\nUsing a centralized exchange for bridging purposes is an effective method for reducing these risks. As a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, OKX employs world-class security measures to make sure worldwide users can buy and sell BTC safely and seamlessly. Visit our security of funds and Proof of Reserves page for more details.\n\nAvoiding common pitfalls\n\nRead on for some of the common pitfalls to avoid while you\u2019re bridging your assets to Optimism:\n\nMake sure to review all the fields you fill out. Once you confirm the transaction, there's no way to undo it. Be mindful of the gas fees . During periods of high demand and congestion on the Ethereum network, \u200cgas fees may reach a high level. It's advised to either wait for the fees to decrease or use a centralized exchange for transactions. High slippage and liquidity issues are another aspect to look out for. You may encounter significant slippage if you use an unfamiliar bridge or bridge to a coin with limited trading volume. To prevent this, restrict your bridging to assets with ample liquidity.\n\nTroubleshooting and support\n\nCommon bridging issues and solutions\n\nStuck transactions are common and can occur when the gas fee for Ethereum isn't set correctly. If the gas is too low, the transaction will fail and the funds will be returned to your wallet. Transactions may also get stuck on congested cryptocurrency bridges. But, they're designed to handle these situations and will eventually be resolved with time. Cross-chain compatibility: Make sure there's sufficient liquidity for the asset you\u2019re bridging and that it\u2019s compatible with the chain every time you bridge.\n\nWhere to seek help\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is known for being supportive. If you encounter any problems, you can easily seek assistance."

        "content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Malaysia News once a month in your Inbox\n\nLuno, a regulated digital asset exchange in Malaysia, has recently introduced Ethereum (ETH) staking, offering an opportunity for customers to earn ETH rewards on a weekly basis. This initiative positions Luno as the first regulated exchange in the country to provide such a feature.\n\nScarlett Chai, Luno\u2019s Country Manager for Malaysia, commented on the launch, stating,\n\n\u201cAt Luno, we\u2019re on a mission to improve our product continuously and we\u2019re thrilled to be the first regulated exchange to bring Staking to our Malaysian customers.\u201d \u201cBy adding staking, we are giving customers the opportunity to explore more of what crypto has to offer,\u201d\n\nshe added.\n\nThe Luno staking feature, currently supporting Ethereum, allows users to earn up to 4% per year in ETH, with the rate subject to fluctuations based on network demand and validator activity.\n\nStaking in the cryptocurrency domain is a process that contributes to transaction verification, especially in systems that use a proof of stake mechanism, such as Ethereum. By staking their crypto, users see an increment in their holdings through rewards, although these staked coins are locked from selling or transferring until they decide to \u201cunstake.\u201d\n\nThe staking process is designed to be user-friendly, with a minimum deposit requirement of 0.00001 ETH or RM1, appealing to those who plan to hold ETH long-term.\n\nLuno offers up to 4% annual rewards on staked Ethereum, although the exchange says this figure can vary with network conditions. The staking service is accessible to a wide audience, requiring a minimal investment and no technical expertise, but it does include a fee deducted from the rewards.\n\nScarlett further advised customers to exercise due diligence and informed decision-making in cryptocurrency investments.\n\nFollowing South Africa, Malaysia is the second market where Luno has introduced staking for its clients. Luno also plans to launch staking for Cardano (ADA) soon, expanding its staking options for customers.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from Luno"

        "title": "What Is ERC-1155 and How Does It Work? - Binance Academy",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nERC-1155 is a token standard on Ethereum designed to optimize the creation and management of crypto assets.\n\nIt allows the combination of fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single smart contract, streamlining transactions and reducing costs.\n\nERC-1155's secure transfer mechanism and other safety features enhance user confidence and address common challenges associated with sending tokens to incorrect addresses.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthereum, the blockchain that introduced the world to smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), continues to evolve rapidly. Among its notable features are the so-called token standards, which ensure that assets and products built on Ethereum are compatible with one another.\n\nAlong with the ERC-20 and ERC-721, the ERC-1155 is one of the most important token standards on Ethereum. In this in-depth exploration, we'll delve into the intricacies of ERC-1155, understand how it works, and its significance in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWhat Is the ERC-1155 Token Standard?\n\nERC-1155, an abbreviation for Ethereum Request for Comments 1155, represents a set of standards designed to enhance the versatility of smart contracts and tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. In the context of blockchain, tokens are digital assets that can either be fungible (identical and interchangeable) or non-fungible (each token is unique). Prior to ERC-1155, these two types of tokens were governed by distinct technical standards, such as the ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHow ERC-1155 Works\n\nTo comprehend the significance of ERC-1155, let\u2019s imagine a scenario where you interact with a blockchain game that has a diverse set of items like swords, shields, and in-game coins. Before ERC-1155, each of these items required an exclusive set of rules within a smart contract. ERC-1155 simplifies this complexity by enabling all these diverse items to coexist harmoniously within a single smart contract. So, instead of managing separate contracts for each digital item, ERC-1155 consolidates them, streamlining the management of various tokens.\n\nKey Advantages of ERC-1155\n\nIn short, ERC-1155 stands out for its efficiency, adaptability, reduction of redundancy, enhanced security features, and support for various token types.\n\n1. Enhanced efficiency\n\nWith ERC-1155, the transfer of different token types can occur in a single transaction. This capability significantly expedites transactions and reduces associated costs. Imagine sending a sword, a shield, and some gold coins to a friend \u2013 all accomplished seamlessly in a single transaction.\n\n2. Versatility beyond gaming\n\nWhile ERC-1155 is very useful for gaming applications, its adaptability extends far beyond this niche. It can effortlessly handle any token type, whether it's currency, collectibles, or specialized tickets. This versatility positions ERC-1155 as a valuable tool for diverse applications across various industries.\n\n3. Reduction in redundancy\n\nPrior to ERC-1155, each token type necessitated its own contract, resulting in redundant copies of similar functionalities. ERC-1155 alleviates this redundancy by consolidating different token types within a single contract, optimizing space utilization, and simplifying token management.\n\n4. Safe transfer mechanism\n\nERC-1155 incorporates a safety feature that allows the reclamation of tokens if inadvertently sent to the wrong address. This represents a significant improvement over previous token standards, providing users with enhanced security and peace of mind.\n\n5. Support for various token types\n\nUnlike its predecessors, ERC-1155 supports not only fungible and non-fungible tokens but also semi-fungible tokens. These tokens, akin to general admission concert tickets, are interchangeable before the show but transform into unique collectibles afterward.\n\nERC-20 vs. ERC-1155 vs. ERC-721\n\nBelow is a short comparison table highlighting the key differences between the ERC-20, ERC-1155, and ERC-721 token standards.\n\nAs we can see, ERC-20 is used for interchangeable tokens like digital currency, ERC-721 is for unique tokens like digital art, and ERC-1155 combines features, offering flexibility for both use cases within a single contract.\n\nWho's Using ERC-1155?\n\nNumerous projects are leveraging the advantages offered by ERC-1155. Notable examples include:\n\nEnjin: a blockchain platform that uses ERC-1155 to power its digital asset and virtual economies ecosystem. Enjin is focused on the creation of NFTs and Web3 assets used in blockchain-based games.\n\nOpenSea: A prominent NFT marketplace leveraging ERC-1155, enabling multiple creators per contract, thus fostering collaboration and creativity.\n\nOpenZeppelin: A provider of blockchain security products utilizing the ERC-1155 standard, underlining its adoption in critical areas of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe Future Landscape of ERC-1155\n\nDespite being in existence for several years, ERC-1155 continues to be underutilized compared to its ERC-20 and ERC-721 counterparts. This may stem from a lack of awareness of its capabilities, but as projects become more familiar with ERC-1155's versatility, migration to this standard may become a natural progression.\n\nThe emergence of play-to-earn games, where players can earn tokens while playing, might help accelerate the adoption of ERC-1155. In addition, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are also finding utility in ERC-1155, especially those that predominantly operate on-chain and require diverse token types.\n\nThe flexibility inherent in ERC-1155 opens the door to a variety of use cases, many of which have yet to be fully explored. As blockchain technology advances, ERC-1155 is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital assets on the Ethereum network.\n\nBenefits of ERC-1155\n\nUser-friendly transactions: With ERC-1155's efficiency, users can expect smoother and more cost-effective transactions, especially when dealing with multiple token types.\n\nExpanded functionality for DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) can benefit from ERC-1155's support for diverse token types, facilitating on-chain operations.\n\nPlay-to-earn: The emergence of play-to-earn games could propel ERC-1155 adoption, offering players the ability to earn tokens seamlessly during gameplay.\n\nAs projects explore and integrate ERC-1155, the potential benefits for users, developers, and the broader blockchain community become increasingly evident.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nIn summary, ERC-1155 brought great improvements to the Ethereum ecosystem, streamlining token management, reducing redundancy, and unlocking new possibilities. Its impact is already evident in various projects, and as awareness spreads, ERC-1155 will likely continue to function as a cornerstone of Ethereum's token standards.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

        "title": "Ethereum Analysis: Strong Selloffs Looms as CME Gap Remains Open - Coinfomania",
        "content": "The CME Bitcoin Gap (also known as the CMG gap) is the difference between the closing price of CME Bitcoin futures contracts on Friday and the opening price on Sunday. It is a crucial indicator for many Bitcoin traders, and a great tool for improving profitability.\n\nGenerally, you can also improve your cryptocurrency trading efficiency by learning to use gaps as an indicator. It is essential to start with the basics when learning about CME gaps. This includes getting to know what gaps are and their types.\n\nWhat Are Gaps?\n\nA gap is created when the price of an asset opens above or below the previous day\u2019s close with no recorded price movement in between. In simple terms, the space created on the price chart as a result of the above scenario is the Gap.\n\nOne of the responsible factors for this kind of move is news. Most times when the market is closed and positive or negative news drops, price movements are not recorded, creating a gap. Most times, these gaps show the end or beginning of a market trend.\n\nThere are different types of gaps. These are Common gaps, Breakaway gaps, Runaway gaps, and Exhaustion gaps.\n\nCommon gaps\n\nAs the name implies, these gaps happen often and are quickly filled. There are no notable occurrences that may trigger this sort of gap as they are often triggered by normal market force. Common gaps are also known as area gaps or trading gaps.\n\nBreakaway gaps\n\nBreakaway gaps occur when prices break an established chart pattern. It normally appears out of chart patterns like; a triangle, head and shoulder, cup and handle, a wedge.\n\nRunaway gaps\n\nThe runaway gap happens when the price movement skips a laid-out price point. Runaway gaps are triggered by intense investor interest and happen often when there is an exchange in the ownership of an asset.\n\nExhaustion gaps\n\nThis sort of gap is marked by a space lower in price after a fast rise in the price of an asset through several weeks. This gap shows or signals the end of an upward trend.\n\nWith a basic knowledge of gaps, let\u2019s talk about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nAn Introduction to the CME\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is the world\u2019s largest derivatives trading exchange. CME offers futures and options contracts on any imaginable asset. These assets range from agricultural products to different commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, energy, and even forex.\n\nThe CME began offering Bitcoin futures on December 18,2017. In terms of volume, CME is the largest U.S. regulated trading venue for trading Bitcoin futures contracts, making it a key price discovery machine for investors.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Futures Contracts\n\nIn its simplest form, Bitcoin futures contracts are derivatives that allow a buyer and seller to determine the future price at which an asset will be exchanged.\n\nFor instance, an investor can choose to enter a contract to buy Bitcoin at $40,000 by the end of the month, even though the current market price is $50,000. The buyer pays a small premium to open this contract and reserves the right to make or not make the purchase if the price of Bitcoin drops to $40,000 on the said date. If the price of Bitcoin fails to hit the strike price on the expiry date, then the contract expires and the contract buyer only loses the small amount paid as premium.\n\nBitcoin futures contracts are ideal as they allow investors to profit from an increase or decrease in the price of Bitcoin, without holding the underlying bitcoin. It also provides a sort of hedge for long-term investors, as they can get exposure to price action without selling their long-term holdings.\n\nBitcoin CME Gap Explained\n\nYou can trade cryptocurrencies from any unrestricted area around the clock. However, traditional assets do not trade 24/7 around the clock. For most traditional exchanges, there is a set time to open and close and CME also follows this normal rule.\n\nWhat time is CME Gap?\n\nCME trading hours close every week on Friday at 5:45 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) or (10:45 PM London Time). The exchange resumes trading on Sunday at 6:00 PM EST (11:00 PM London Time).\n\nSince CME Bitcoin futures contracts stops trading on Friday to reopen on Sunday, there is always a price difference when it reopens. The price difference is the Bitcoin CME gap.\n\n(Source: TradingView)\n\nTo illustrate this, take Binance for example. You can trade on Binance at any you want; it does not have a fixed time to open or close. CME, on the other hand, has a fixed time to open or close.\n\nWhen CME closes, the price of Bitcoin continues to appreciate or depreciate. Due to the close of the market, the price movement is not recorded on the price chart, so when CME opens on Sunday the price continues with the same price as the spot market creating a gap on the price chart, which needs to be filled.\n\nHow Does The Bitcoin CME Gap Affect BTC Price?\n\nAs explained above, when CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures contracts close every week, a gap is created. These gaps often fill in the sense that the spot price of BTC will go back to the CME closing price.\n\nSo let\u2019s imagine CME closed at $50,200 and opens at $53,000. There is a gap of $2,800 in between that was not recorded on the price chart. So when CME resumes, depending on the type of gap, there is the likelihood of prices reverting to the close to filling that gap.\n\nBitcoin CME gaps typically occur over the weekend or during public holidays.\n\nHow to Make Money with the Bitcoin CME Gap\n\nCME\u2019s Bitcoin prices may close at a high price and open at a low. When this sort of situation happens, the spot price will usually rise to fill the CME gap that was created. However, if the opening price after a weekend is higher than the closing price on Friday, then there\u2019s a high chance that the spot price will correct within 24 hours after the market reopens.\n\nUsing this information, you can make decisions that will make your trading more profitable.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s assume that a common gap appears on a price chart and BTC CME closed at $46,000 and opens at $43,700. It\u2019s easy to predict what will happen as you\u2019ve recognized what kind of gap it is and you know that prices will likely pump to fill the gap.\n\nWhen there is a breakaway gap, you know that the end of a price pattern is close, and depending on the pattern, you can foresee what will transpire later on and make your trading decisions accordingly.\n\nHow accurate are the CME Bitcoin Gaps?\n\nHistorically, the percentage of CME gaps that get filled is between 60-80%. Hence, using it as an indicator provides you with a degree of accuracy. A review of previous events could shade more light on this claim.\n\nCME Bitcoin Gap: Example 1\n\nThe image above shows a common gap. On Dec 31, 2020, CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures closed at a $29,410 price. However, the spot price of Bitcoin went up to around $33,050 when CME opened on Jan, 3.\n\nSo, although CME reopened at around $33k after the celebration, it is almost impossible not to notice on the first chart that as soon as the market reopened, the current Bitcoin CME gap filled within 12 hours; the price dipped to the point it closed on December 31.\n\nCME Bitcoin Gap: Example 2\n\nAnother small common gap is seen in the image above. This gap was created from Friday, March 12 through Sunday, March 14. Trading closed at $57,515 and opened at $58,695 to match the increase in spot BTC price during the weekend.\n\nA small gap worth $1050 was filled the following day.\n\nIt is worth noting that CME Bitcoin gaps are not created equal as some gaps are wider than others. Also, while most Bitcoin CME gaps historically fill up within 24 hours, some take several days, and may not fill at all. For instance, there were Bitcoin CME Gaps created in 2020 when the asset was still trading around $10,000. There are also historical gaps between $8000-$24,000 which may never get filed,\n\nWhy do CME Gaps get filled?\n\nCME Gaps get filled because of the consensus effect. Since most Bitcoin traders assume that the gap will get filled, they place trades with the gap in mind. This affects the general market price movement and ensures that the CME gaps get filled as predicted. It is worth noting that this stance may change as Bitcoin continues to mature as an asset class.\n\nRelated: What Causes Cryptocurrency to Rise and Fall\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, we have seen what gaps are and their different types. We also discussed the responsible factors for the Bitcoin CME gap. Various charts were also shown to visualize the CME gap meaning and how traders can profit from it.\n\nIn the concluding part of the article, we discussed the reason why CME gaps provide up to 60-80% accuracy by providing different examples, showing how they formed and how they filled. As an exercise, you can try pulling up the spot Bitcoin price over the weekend and compare it with CME Bitcoin opening and closing prices.\n\nIn summary, the CME Bitcoin gap is another interesting indicator for every trader to consider."

        "content": "Binance Labs, its investment and startup assistance section, recently made a strategic investment in Puffer, a decentralized protocol for liquid asset reinvestment. A novel strategy that combines Ethereum liquid staking with native restaking on EigenLayer offers Ethereum validators a unique solution.\n\nPuffer Technology Advances with Binance Labs Investment\n\nPuffer reduces operational risks and validation costs to democratize Ethereum staking for at-home validators. Binance Labs\u2019 recent investment is expected to promote Puffer\u2019s open-source technology, particularly its native liquid restaking protocol (nLRP) and actively verified services. These funds will also help Puffer\u2019s Layer 2 (L2) infrastructure evolve.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation funded Puffer\u2019s Secure-Signer remote signature technology. Validators need this tool to reduce slashing and maximize capital efficiency in Puffer\u2019s protocol. Research company Puffer collaborated with Ethereum Foundation core researcher Justin Drake to publish security research. Applications like Scroll have influenced pool procedures and inspired changes to the Ethereum roadmap using this research.\n\nPuffer plans to implement Layer 2 as an EigenLayer that is actively checked. This strategic approach is projected to create network effects, especially when more AVSs are added and benefit from Puffer\u2019s economic security. This integration boosts Puffer\u2019s permissionless validators\u2019 benefits, encourages their involvement, and promotes Ethereum network decentralization. Moreover, Binance Labs invested in Puffer to support early decentralized finance (DeFi) ventures.\n\nBinance Labs Founder Emphasizes Early Support for DeFi Innovation\n\nBinance Labs founder Yi He said the platform supports innovative DeFi projects. He stressed the importance of supporting initiatives in their early stages and Binance Labs\u2019 commitment to working with DeFi founders to ensure their success.\n\nPuffer\u2019s liquid restaking token (nLRT) will launch on the BNB Chain, allowing Binance users to access Ethereum\u2019s PoS and restaking incentives. This improves BNB Chain functionality and expands user participation in the DeFi ecosystem. What\u2019s more, Ethereum validators face high costs and risks, which often lead to institutional dominance and power concentration.\n\nTrending Now: US Crypto Broker Sentenced to Prison for $5.5M Bitcoin Scheme\n\nAmir Forouzani, the creator of Puffer, emphasized Puffer\u2019s distinctive technique, which has the backing of renowned researchers. EigenLayer is used to boost validator profits, decentralize Ethereum, and reinforce its infrastructure. Moreover, Forouzani expressed interest in building a solid foundation for decentralized trust, ensuring a long-term, flourishing environment.\n\nBinance Labs\u2019 investment in Puffer advances decentralized native liquid restaking solutions. Puffer\u2019s work with prominent researchers has significantly impacted Ethereum staking and the decentralization of the blockchain ecosystem."
