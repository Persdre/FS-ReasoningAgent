        "content": "VanEck now awaits the SEC's decision on spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nKey Takeaways VanEck has officially filed an S-1 for a spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC's decision on VanEck's Ethereum ETF is highly anticipated.\n\nShare this article\n\nAsset management firm VanEck has officially submitted an S-1 registration form to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The filing represents a key step toward potentially launching the first spot Ethereum ETF in the country.\n\nAccording to the preliminary prospectus, the proposed VanEck Ethereum ETF would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cETHV.\u201d\n\nThe fund\u2019s objective is to reflect the performance of Ethereum\u2019s price, minus expenses. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Erich Balchunas, this move from VanEck should promptly be followed by similar filings from other issuers within the day, except from Bitwise, which has already filed its S-1 a week before.\n\nThe ETF would hold actual Ethereum and value its shares daily based on the MarketVector Ethereum Benchmark Rate. This index is calculated using prices from what VanEck considers the top five Ethereum trading platforms.\n\nNotably, the filing states that neither the trust nor any associated parties will engage in Ethereum staking or other yield-generating activities with the fund\u2019s assets. The ETF would initially only allow cash creations and redemptions by authorized participants.\n\nVanEck\u2019s filing comes as the crypto industry awaits the SEC\u2019s approval of the first spot Ethereum ETF, which could provide a more direct exposure to Ethereum\u2019s price movements compared to existing futures-based products. ETF analysts such as Nate Geraci estimate that issuers are already \u201cgearing up for launch\u201d in the next couple of weeks.\n\nHowever, the path to approval remains uncertain. To date, the SEC has not yet approved any spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns around market manipulation and investor protection. The regulator will review VanEck\u2019s application in the coming weeks.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated."

        "content": "Tim Lowe of Attestant writes that, created in 2009, bitcoin is a \u201cPeer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d. Vitalik Buterin extended bitcoin and launched Ethereum in 2015, a \u201cDecentralised Application Platform\u201d.\n\nETH and BTC are the tokens used to pay transaction fees and to reward those running blockchain software. BTC is referred to as an inflation hedge or digital gold. ETH could be digital oil, fuel that enables Digital Apps (dApps). Ethereum dApps enable tokenisation, financial infrastructure, games and even social media networks. Applications also enable Ethereum\u2019s use as a backbone for blockchains known as Layer 2s. These are designed around specific requirements such as speed, then use Ethereum as a secure, settlement layer between chains and institutions.\n\nThe market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies has grown over the last five years, however they are still volatile. Bitcoin can be considered digital gold\u2026 for the brave. Physical gold still has substantially lower volatility. Despite the differences in the blockchains, they are still highly correlated in terms of price. Changes in BTC price currently drive the crypto market as a whole.\n\nIssuance of new tokens is one area of difference and is defined in the software of each blockchain rather than by committees. Bitcoin issues a fixed number of BTC \u201crewards\u201d every block paid to \u201cminers\u201d operating the network. Initially 50 BTC per block, the software enforces a 50 per cent reduction every 210,000 blocks (~4 years). From July 2024, the reward was 3.125 BTC and will halve again in 2028.\n\nEthereum requires \u201cValidators\u201d to provide an ETH \u201cStake\u201d. Rewards are issued in proportion to the stake. Ethereum also removes a portion of transaction fees from circulation. Block rewards increase new ETH, transactions remove ETH from circulation. Since 2022 the supply of ETH has reduced by 335k ETH.\n\nValidators running the Ethereum software earn rewards (~3.071 per cent) however this is complex and has created a new industry where technical service providers run the software on behalf of holders in return for a small percentage of the rewards. This provides an opportunity for all ETH holders to earn yield.\n\nLonger term, staking maybe a differentiator between ETH ETFs. The US issuers initially had this as part of their products but for now, it has been removed.\n\nThere are big differences in energy usage across blockchains. Ethereum relies on the Validators ETH Stake as a security guarantee, but bitcoin Miners can only process transactions if they commit computation to the network. Computation makes it expensive for a malicious actor to disrupt the network. For both blockchains, a substantial economic investment is needed by the Software Operators. With Ethereum, the investment is ETH, with bitcoin it is in computation which requires energy.\n\nGold does not need new functionality in order for it to be considered valuable. Many bitcoin developers believe the same \u2013 bitcoin does one thing well and no more, but that is the point. In contrast, Ethereum has a roadmap with releases introducing new functionality every six months.\n\nThe success and adoption of blockchains is driven by the software ecosystem. An annual report published by Electric Capital found over 16,000 Ethereum developers, more than any other Blockchain by a very large margin. Bitcoin was found to have only 1,853 developers.\n\nAccounts holding more than USD100 have grown across both blockchains with a sharp uptick in recent months. Ethereum transactions are steadily growing and account for around four times that of bitcoin. If Ethereum \u201cLayer 2\u201d blockchains are included, the transaction count is far higher and growing.\n\nAs the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies continues, we are seeing governments around the world take a wide spectrum of regulatory actions. El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender; they have since been followed by other countries. In contrast, cryptocurrencies are subject to different types of bans. As the assets become more widely adopted and understood, hopefully regulation will follow.\n\nA more mundane risk is the displacement of ETH and BTC as the dominant cryptocurrencies. Given how embedded bitcoin is in the public consciousness, this maybe more of an issue for Ethereum. However, Ethereum is well established as a platform for dApps and has by far the largest ecosystem. This combined with the nature of software enables Ethereum to include the best innovations found in competing platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies are software and so there is always the risk of defects. There are however mechanisms in place to reduce this risk, for example Ethereum is run using multiple versions of the software developed by different teams.\n\nOn the surface bitcoin and Ether are very similar assets currently with a high degree of price correlation. There are however distinct differences that may, in the longer term, cause a divergence in their price. Ethereum has the potential for a big increase in adoption across a wide variety of sectors whilst the narrative around bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation is growing. Diversification across both assets maybe the best strategy."

This expedited timeline reflects what appears to be constructive dialogue between the regulator and ETF providers.\n\nThe increasing momentum surrounding Ethereum ETFs has prompted additional market activity. YieldMax, a known ETF issuer, has filed for an Ether Option Income Strategy ETF, while Hashdex is pursuing approval for a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision in the coming days is expected to have significant implications for crypto investment.

        "content": "In brief Over 27% of the Ethereum supply is currently being staked.\n\nThe rise of staking has prompted concerns over centralized firms overseeing so much ETH.\n\nProviders of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. won't be able to stake their ETH due to regulatory concerns.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the crypto market eagerly anticipates the potential launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S., a staggering 32.6 million ETH\u2014over 27% of the total supply\u2014is now being used to secure Ethereum's proof-of-stake network, according to the latest data from Coinbase.\n\nThis milestone underscores the growing enthusiasm for Ethereum staking, even as the ecosystem grapples with the implications of the long-awaited Ethereum ETFs. The new exchange-traded funds, unlike their underlying asset, won't be able to stake their holdings due to regulatory constraints.\n\nThe rise in staked ETH has been steady, with a brief slowdown following the Shanghai upgrade in spring 2023. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading just below $3,000, down 14% over the past week amid broader market volatility.\n\nThe SEC's approval process for Ethereum ETFs has been slower than initially expected. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on Twitter (aka X), \"We're thinking these things could potentially list later next week or the week of the 15th at this point.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis comes after Bitwise filed an amended S-1 form ahead of the July 8 deadline, potentially indicating that the products are nearly ready for launch. VanEck then filed its own amended S-1 on Monday.\n\nEvan Van Ness, a prominent Ethereum researcher, offered insights on the staking situation. \"We definitely don't need this much ETH staked, given how Ethereum proof-of-stake has so many times more economic security than proof-of-work,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nHe also cautioned about centralization risks: \"If your staking pool is running a majority client or runs in the cloud, you are putting your ETH at risk.\"\n\nThe inability of ETFs to stake has spurred innovative approaches from traditional finance players. Franklin Templeton, managing $1.6 trillion in assets, is planning to launch a fund focused on altcoins and staking rewards, unnamed sources with knowledge of the firm told The Information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStaked Ethereum, Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nMeanwhile, Toronto-based Purpose Investments already has an Ethereum fund that's allowed to stake the underlying ETH.\n\n\"We've always been excited about Ethereum and what the technology and ecosystem represent,\" he said in a press release. \"Initially, a corporate structure was the best option; now we believe an ETF is the most efficient.\"\n\nThe flurry of activity around Ethereum staking and ETFs raises questions about the future of the ecosystem, too. As more institutional players wade into staking waters and the percentage of staked ETH climbs, the Ethereum community will be watching closely to see how these developments impact the network's security, decentralization, and overall health.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, shared his thoughts on staking economics at the EthStaker Staking Gathering last year. \"Staking on Ethereum is influenced by reward curves and overall economic incentives built into the protocol,\" he said. \"The goal is to create a sustainable and secure system that encourages participation and maintains the network's integrity.\"\n\nThe recent market downturn, attributed to factors such as the imminent Mt. Gox repayments and macroeconomic concerns, saw Bitcoin fall below $55,000 again on Sunday after nearly touching $54,000 on Friday\u2014the lowest it's been since late February. This volatility underscores the complex interplay between staking trends, ETF anticipation, and broader market forces.\n\nFor now, the 24=7% staking milestone serves as a testament to the growing conviction among ETH holders that staking is the future. Whether that future includes ETFs directly, or whether it will be shaped by a new breed of staking-focused funds and companies, is still unclear. As the crypto world holds its breath for the SEC's final decision, the stage is set for a potentially transformative moment in Ethereum's history.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

As CryptoSlate data indicates, Tether (USDT) maintains a higher volume than Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Solana (SOL), and First Digital USD (FDUSD), pointing to its significant presence in the market. Specifically, Tether recorded a 24-hour volume of over $55 billion, far surpassing Bitcoin\u2019s $28 billion and Ethereum\u2019s $15 billion.\n\nWith a market cap of over $112 billion, the trading patterns also show that Tether\u2019s volume has consistently been robust throughout 2024, peaking at $130 billion on March 16. Tether\u2019s stability and frequent use in trading pairs make it a preferred choice for traders seeking to hedge against volatility.\n\nThese volume statistics reflect broader market trends as Tether provides liquidity and stability. Tether regularly achieves daily trading volumes exceeding $25 billion, reinforcing its status as a key liquidity provider in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nPer Glassnode data, throughout 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen around $4 \u2013 $8 billion per day, far below Tether\u2019s volumes.\n\nThe high trading volume of Tether compared to other major digital assets illustrates its integral role in daily trading activities and the broader market strategy that traders and institutions employ. This continuous high-volume trading signifies trust and reliance on Tether\u2019s stability and accessibility, making it indispensable for efficient market functioning.\n\nWhile Tether has historically faced recounted challenges regarding its reserves and use in illicit activities, these volumes showcase its resilience in combating these claims. Tether\u2019s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently told CryptoSlate that Tether is currently over-collateralized, with the firm\u2019s profits being put back into reserves to strengthen its stability.\n\nFurther, Ardoino commented how Senator Warren\u2019s discouragement of accounting firms from engaging with Tether had hindered its ability to use one of the US\u2019s top four accountants for audits. The CEO claimed that Tether is continuously seeking to hire one of the leading companies but has almost given up on it happening any time soon, regardless of their efforts to do so.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum price has crawled back in the past two days as investors focus on the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nETH price rose to $3,112 on Tuesday, 10.5% above where it traded at last Friday. There are hopes that the SEC will approve ETFs soon as companies continue filing their final documents with the agency.\n\nVanEck submitted its amended filing on Monday, while Invesco filed on Tuesday morning. Bitwise and 21Shares have also made their filings. Analysts believe that these funds could start trading as soon as this week.\n\nFirst S-1 just rolled in today from VanEck.. they already had their fee so nothing to see here really, they just putting ball back in SEC's court. Expecting the rest today except for Bitwise who did theirs last week. pic.twitter.com/gF6OZTKIrs \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2024\n\nThese funds come a few months after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $14 billion in inflows.\n\n2 reasons to avoid spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nEthereum funds will provide non-traditional crypto investors a good way to track the price of Ethereum without the need to deal with some of the complexities of crypto, such as wallet keys. As such, funds will be ideal for large institutional investors who find it overly complex to deal with real coins.\n\nHowever, there are two main reasons why investors should consider investing in Ethereum instead of ETFs.\n\nFirst, buying and holding ETF in a hot or cold wallet is in reality a relatively simple process. One can easily do that using one of the popular exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, crypto.com, among many others.\n\nAfter buying Ether, the only fee that customers pay is when they are selling their coins to exit the investment.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum funds will have an expense ratio, likely around 0.25%. In its filing, Invesco Galaxy revealed that its fund will have a unified sponsor fee of 0.25%. This means that a $100,000 investment will attract an annual fee of about $250. Over ten years, if Ether remains steady, an investor would pay $2,500 in fees.\n\nThe fee differential explains why Bitcoin has had a better return than spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the past six months, Bitcoin has risen by 24.31% while the other ETFs have risen by about 20.7%. This spread will compound over time.\n\nBitcoin vs IBIT vs FBTC vs ARKB ETFs\n\nSecond, Ethereum funds will not have staking features, which provides steady income to investors. Data compiled by StakingRewards shows that the total staked Ether stands at over $100 billion, giving it a staking ratio of 27.16%. It has a yield of about 3.29% and a $100k investment will return nearly $3,300 a year.\n\nTherefore, since Ether and spot ETH ETFs will move in sync, it seems like a better idea to just stake Ether."

        "title": "7 Famous Ethereum Investors that You Should Know - UseTheBitcoin",
        "content": "Currently, the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has started to attract more attention from investors. After December 2017 when, along with most other cryptos, ETH price hit an all-time high even more Ethereum investors have joined the market. Today we will list the 7 most famous ones.\n\nOne reason why Ethereum has become a favorite among investors is the fact that it\u2019s actually so much more than just a cryptocurrency project. In fact, one could argue that Ethereum is the world\u2019s most important blockchain project, since it actively contributes to the mainstream adoption of cryptos thanks to its platform that offers support for dApps, smart contracts, and new blockchain projects.\n\nAs with all cryptocurrencies, there are various risks involved when it comes to investing in Ethereum as a platform. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped a great number of people from doing just that, including various celebrities and big names within the cryptosphere.\n\nHere is a list of famous Ethereum investors:\n\nJoseph Lubin\n\nBoasting immense experience in fields such as software engineering, robotics, machine vision, and neural nets, Joseph Lubin is also one of the biggest names to be associated with the Ethereum project. The co-founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys (a Brooklyn-based software company focused on building dApps based on the Ethereum platform) may very well be one of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nAccording to various rumors, Joseph Lubin was one of the top buyers in the Ethereum crowd sale event that took place a couple of years ago. Joseph Lubin is regarded, by various industry insiders, as being one of the most important holders of Ethereum, with a valuation that is supposed to be as high as $10 billion.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Lubin is also the founder of the Swiss-based company EthSuisse that has been heavily investing in Ethereum. With ConsenSys and EthSuisse, they do not only invest in the future of the network but also in solutions that would be able to offer better services to users.\n\nIn addition to it, Lubin has also been involved in different cross-industry groups that aimed at advancing solutions related to governance issues in the blockchain space. Thus, when you buy Ethereum, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean funds directly to developers, but it can also be by developing new services, gathering efforts to create new solutions, and expand the whole ecosystem.\n\nSource: rte.ie\n\nRichard Sherman\n\nRichard Sherman, an American football cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL (National Football League), is yet another famous person passionate about cryptocurrencies. Sherman started as a Bitcoin and Ethereum investor extremely early, after fans started asking if they could purchase products and merchandise from his official website using various digital coins.\n\nRichard declared on multiple occasions that he owns a few BTC, ETH, and LTC but is not really interested in the multitude of other smaller coins. He purchased Bitcoin when it was valued somewhere around $1,000 and managed to cash out when the prices skyrocketed upwards of 19,000. Regardless, he declared that he regrets not keeping the Bitcoins as they were.\n\nRichard Sherman has been selected to the Pro Bowl four times and has also been voted All-Pro four times. He has been playing in the Seattle Seahawks between 2011 and 2017 and in the San Francisco 49ers since 2018.\n\nMr. Sherman is not only interested in cryptocurrencies but he is also an ambassador for the trivia application FleetWit. Moreover, he has also invested in other tech stocks, showing that he has a diversified portfolio.\n\nThere are different individuals that decided to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss Brothers \u2013 Ethereum Investors\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have made headlines on numerous occasions due to their connection with the crypto world. Even though the brothers have made a name for themselves after suing Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, claiming that he stole their idea of a social network, nowadays, the Winklevoss brothers are known as some of the biggest Ethereum investors.\n\nThe lawsuit allowed the brothers to settle for a whopping $65 million of Facebook stock and cash. After seeing an opportunity in blockchain and crypto technology, they decided to invest in Bitcoin. The brothers ended up buying 120,000 Bitcoin in 2012 when the price was less than $10. After their financial success, they re-invested and racked up around $350 million from other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum included. The siblings are also renowned for creating the New York-based crypto exchange called Gemini.\n\nAlthough the Winklevoss brothers have been investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and focus on this digital asset, they were also holding Ethereum. Tyler Winklevoss explained that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were not compliant with securities law and that they are tokens on top of tokens. Regarding the value of the Ethereum network and its tokens, Mr. Winkleovss said that its value lies in the network itself rather than on other digital tokens.\n\nAt the moment there is no clear information regarding the amount of ETH that they hold or whether they have decided to sell a part of their stake. Nonetheless, they will continue playing an important role in the whole cryptocurrency market independently from the virtual currency they hold.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nVitalik Buterin \u2013 Ethereum Founder\n\nVitalik Buterin is a name that hardly requires any introduction, especially for those well accustomed with the crypto space. Our list wouldn\u2019t be complete without Vitalik, the mastermind behind the whole Ethereum project, and, arguably, the most important person in the crypto sphere after Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that Vitalik Buterin is a very wealthy man with one of the biggest net worths in crypto. Even though the inventor has never publicly acknowledged how much ETH he owns, there have been reports of him transferring 30,000 ETH to Bitstamp, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, somewhere in December 2017. Other forums and public posts depict Vitalik as the holder of somewhere around 500,000 ETH.\n\nAt the end of the day, nobody can answer this question apart from Vitalik Buterin himself. What\u2019s more amazing is that when most people think about Buterin, they don\u2019t see that wealthy man, but the inventor of one of the best blockchains platforms, a person for whom money is not a priority, and always looking to solve real problems within the crypto sphere.\n\nMr. Buterin has been involved in the cryptocurrency market and their investment on the Ethereum network is not merely financial. He is dedicated to Ethereum as a developer and leader of different teams that are investing their time and funds in improving the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThus, spending time and effort in the network is also a way of investing in it. Furthermore, there are many companies that rely on his recommendations and advice in order to invest their money in developers working on top of Ethereum. More adoption means stronger fundamentals for Ethereum, which would eventually be translated into a higher price of the ETH digital asset.\n\nButerin is in a similar situation as Joseph Lubin. Both of them co-founded Ethereum and they have been working in order to expand Ethereum\u2019s solutions and projects. They may not invest large amounts of money directly in ETH but they have been working in order for ETH to have more value over time.\n\nSource: Ethereum World News\n\nAshton Kutcher\n\nAshton Kutcher, the Hollywood actor, is known for being passionate about technology in general. He was also one of the early investors in technologies and apps such as Airbnb and Uber, as well as for cryptocurrencies. He was one of the first celebrities to jump onto the crypto craze bandwagon and has even tweeted about Ethereum in 2014, almost a year before its initial release. Kutcher is said to be one of the big Bitcoin and Ethereum investors, even though an official number is yet to be released.\n\nSource: MarketWatch\n\nCharles Hoskinson\n\nCharles Hoskinson is also one of the co-founders of Ethereum. He is now the lead developer of Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). He has been working in order to offer alternative solutions to Ethereum.\n\nDespite that, he is an early adopter of virtual currencies. He entered the space when Bitcoin was traded close to $1. When the digital currency moved to $250 he decided to lead other major projects and start moving forward with the expansion in the crypto space.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that he is among the early Ethereum investors as the co-founder of the network. However, he didn\u2019t disclose part of his investments in the crypto project or whether he sold all his coins after some time.\n\nHe has been involved in a large number of crypto projects and now is focused on Cardano, one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. The work he has been doing is very positive for the crypto market, something that helped increase the level of technical improvements in the crypto space. Ethereum is also now trying to compete with other networks, including Cardano, which is allowing developers to offer even better solutions and products.\n\nSimilarly to what Lubin and Buterin did, Hoskinson invested his time rather than just money on Ethereum. Thus, because of him and his passion for crypto projects, we could now have a much more advanced network and cryptocurrency industry. 11\n\nCole is a freelance writer focusing on cryptocurrency and emerging technologies. Previous articles on Masternodes have been featured on leading crypto websites and quoted in Whitepapers.\n\nWant to buy Ethereum today?

Per the latest tweet from Whale Alert, 11,215 ETH were transferred from an unknown wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase earlier today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis latest ETH transaction is estimated to be worth around $34.35 million. It is a major move as it appears that the whale has shifted ETH in order to trigger a sell-off. Moreover, the timing of this sell-off is crucial as it comes amid the recent market crash.\n\nThe broader crypto market has been consolidating after last week\u2019s crash. The price of Ethereum, the leading altcoin, has crashed 16.68% over the last 30 days. This shows the intensity of this market dump, impacting major coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) .\n\nWhile many are still expecting a price recovery from ETH, it appears that some traders are dumping their holdings. In the case of this Ethereum whale, they have almost $34.35 million in ETH. Since this is a major amount, it can further impact the market and push the ETH price to lower levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhales always play a crucial role on the digital asset market. The buying and selling from these traders leave short-term impacts on the price movements of a particular coin. In this case, the Ethereum price can absorb the toll of this sell-off. It may hinder the potential recovery of the coin after a recent downturn.\n\nETH price outlook\n\nAs of press time, Ethereum is trading around $3,072. While the price is up 0.52% in the last 24 hours, it has failed to recover from the previous losses. The recent bearish sentiment has not been good for bulls, causing uncertainty on the market."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the crypto market awaits a regulatory green light on spot Ethereum ETFs, amended filings from several asset managers suggested the approval process continues apace.\n\nVanEck was first to submit an amended registration statement for its spot Ethereum ETF Monday, unveiling a new name for its product: The VanEck Ethereum Trust. That move was followed by 21Shares, which submitted a new registration for its spot Ethereum ETFs as well.\n\nGrayscale then joined in with two amended filings of its own, one for the $28 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and another for a \u201cmini\u201d equivalent intended to be a lower-cost alternative.\n\nFranklin Templeton subsequently filed an amended filing for its spot Ethereum ETF, followed by Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNone of Monday's filings included details on their planned fees, which Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the SEC had yet to require. He suggested there would be one more round of updates with fees included, \u201cand then it's go time.\u201d\n\nBecause the SEC asked for the S-1s on July 8th but told issuers the fee wasn't nec yet. They will give guidance back to issuers soon along with the game plan. Then the docs come will come back with fees (and every other blank) filled it and then it's Go time. https://t.co/S4u8HaMckh \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2024\n\n\u201cIf you forced me gun-to-head style to give my best guess for date, I'd go with July 18th,\u201d he added.\n\nIn terms of alterations, some regulatory language regarding custody was snipped from VanEck\u2019s registration statement. A scrapped section outlined how Ethereum withdrawals would be processed through the entity that VanEck has chosen to safeguard assets for its fund.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther minor changes mirrored those made by Bitwise last week, which detailed the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) stance on compliance in the crypto market. The section explicitly states that SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes investors using crypto exchanges aren't \u201cadequately protected,\u201d and certain activities may implicate securities laws.\n\n\u201cThe chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from \u2018falling between regulatory cracks,\u2019\u201d VanEck\u2019s filing stated. \u201cThe chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading.\u201d\n\nIn the amended registration statement from 21Shares, the firm included similar disclosure language on the SEC\u2019s regulatory efforts, among other minute details.\n\n\u201cNothing to see here,\u201d Balchunas wrote Balchunas on Twitter (aka X) of 21Shares\u2019 filing.\n\nFinally, a new section within Grayscale\u2019s amended filing for its \u201cmini\u201d ETF makes clear that none of the product\u2019s Ethereum will be staked, referring to the process through which Ethereum tokens are delegated to the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nNone of the applications before the SEC intend to touch Ethereum staking. Prior to the regulator\u2019s approvals, some applicants removed the language from their proposals.\n\nThough the SEC approved several key filings for spot Ethereum ETFs in May, the SEC still needs to approve S-1s from eight asset managers. Previously, Gensler said the approval process is dependent on asset managers\u2019 abilities to provide full disclosures.\n\nAlongside Bitwise\u2019s amended filing last week, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote that the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs may soon be imminent. Whether this week or the next, he forecast that the products\u2019 launches aren\u2019t too far out on the horizon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Ethereum has given up virtually all the gains it saw with the approval of such products. Peaking around $4,000 in late May alongside the SEC's action, Ethereum's price has since drifted below $3,000 amid broader headwinds in the crypto market.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.

        "content": "Several Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, namely VanEck and 21Shares, have submitted updated S-1 forms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, stated that there was nothing noteworthy in the updated filings since the issuers are simply putting the ball back into the agency's court.\n\nProspective ETF issuers are expected to submit their updated S-1 applications by July 8.\n\nLast week, Bitwise also updated its S-1 form ahead of the deadline since there was very little substantial feedback from the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe S-1 form is the initial registration statement that has to be filed with the agency in order to issue new securities. When it comes to ETFs, such funds are supposed to provide an in-depth description of a given fund. This description should include some risks that are associated with a given investment product.\n\nETF issuers are also expected to file 19b-4 applications, which are known as \"exchange rule changes.\" As explained by Matthew Sigel, head of digital research at VanEck, 19b-4 forms, which are required for listing ETF products on the exchange, are usually filed after S-1s.\n\nAt the same time, the two-step ETF approval process involves greenlighting both of these forms by the SEC. In May, the agency shocked the crypto industry by approving several 19b-4 forms for spot Ethereum ETFs. During the same month, financial giant BlackRock updated the S-1 filing for its spot Ethereum ETF product.\n\nAfter more than a month of engaging with potential issuers, the SEC is expected to let several spot Ethereum ETFs start trading as soon as this month, according to industry experts."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Open Network (TON), the blockchain that\u2019s closely tied to popular messaging app Telegram, is getting its first layer-2 scaling network in a collaboration with Polygon Labs.\n\nThe TON Applications Chain (TAC) is being designed as a connection to the Ethereum ecosystem, utilizing Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK) and AggLayer interoperability protocol to enable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) applications to function within the TON ecosystem.\n\nThe layer-2 chain, built on top of TON, is billed as an \u201cofficial layer-2 coming in partnership with TOP (The Open Platform),\u201d a TON representative confirmed to Decrypt. TOP built the Wallet Bot mini app for Telegram, and is working on other initiatives related to TON and Telegram.\n\n\"This collaboration enhances our ability to bridge the gap between TON and Ethereum ecosystems, delivering seamless decentralized app integration within Telegram and fueling unprecedented growth in user engagement,\u201d said TAC CEO Pavel Altukhov, in a release.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe TAC layer-2 announcement comes amid a Telegram gaming boom that\u2019s being fueled by crypto incentives, following the launch of Notcon and its NOT token on TON. A newer game, Hamster Kombat, has racked up over 200 million players in recent weeks ahead of its own token launch on TON, targeted for this month.\n\nTelegram itself has increasingly embraced TON in recent months, including by using it to pay channel operators a share of ad revenue. The scaling network is being billed as a way to bring more decentralized finance (DeFi) action to TON. Michael Egorov, founder of Curve Finance, is part of the founding team behind TAC.\n\n\"[The] collaboration of TAC and Polygon Labs is bringing the necessary EVM expertise to TON,\u201d Egorov said in a press release. \u201cWith that, TAC can connect hundreds of millions of Telegram users with DeFi, possibly driving the next wave of DeFi adoption.\u201d\n\nNo timeline for the layer-2 chain launch was announced. Decrypt reached out for clarification on that point, but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "STAMFORD, Conn., July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grayscale Investments\u00ae, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset manager*, offering more than 20 crypto investment products, today announced that it has set a record date of July 18, 2024 (the \u201cRecord Date\u201d) for the initial creation and distribution of shares of Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (the \u201cETH Trust\u201d) to shareholders of Grayscale Ethereum Trust (Ticker: ETHE) (\u201cETHE\u201d) (referred to as the \u201cInitial Distribution\u201d). Grayscale intends to list the ETH Trust on NYSE Arca, subject to required regulatory approvals, under the ticker symbol \u201cETH.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs part of the contemplated Initial Distribution, each holder of shares (the \u201cETHE Shares\u201d) of ETHE as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be entitled to receive shares (the \u201cETH Shares\u201d) of the ETH Trust, a Delaware statutory trust sponsored by Grayscale, as described in a preliminary information statement on Schedule 14C, initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 23, 2024 and most recently amended on July 8, 2024 (the \u201cPreliminary Information Statement\u201d). ETHE will also file a definitive information statement on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or after the Record Date.\n\nIn the Initial Distribution, ETHE will contribute 10% of the Ether that it holds as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date to the ETH Trust, and each holder of ETHE Shares as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be entitled to receive ETH Shares pro rata based on a 1:1 ratio, such that for each one (1) ETHE Share held by an ETHE shareholder as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date, such ETHE shareholder will be entitled to receive one (1) ETH Share on the Distribution Date, as described below and in the Preliminary Information Statement. ETHE shareholders will not need to pay any consideration, exchange or surrender existing ETHE Shares, or take any other action to receive ETH Shares.\n\nRecord Date July 18, 2024 Ratio of ETHE Shares: ETH\n\nShares 1:1 % of ETHE contributed to the\n\nETH Trust 10% Distribution Date Subject to conditions stated\n\nbelow\n\nImportantly, both the launch of the ETH Trust and the Initial Distribution of ETH Shares to ETHE shareholders are subject to regulatory review and customary conditions. The \u201cDistribution Date\u201d will be the first date following the Record Date on which the conditions to the Initial Distribution have been satisfied, including (i) the filing and effectiveness of the ETH Trust\u2019s registration statement on Form 8-A to register the ETH Shares under the Exchange Act, (ii) the effectiveness of the ETH Trust\u2019s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-278878) under the Securities Act, and (iii) the ETH Shares having been approved for listing on NYSE Arca. The Distribution Date will be no sooner than July 19, 2024, and, as a result of such conditions not having been satisfied as of the date hereof, no assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, or at all.\n\nSubject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE (including with respect to the qualification of both ETHE and the ETH Trust as grantor trusts for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares), it is expected that neither ETHE nor any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the Initial Distribution. Accordingly, it is expected that neither ETHE\u2019s contribution of Ether to the ETH Trust nor ETHE\u2019s distribution of shares in the ETH Trust to ETHE shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on the Record Date will be reported to any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares (or to any intermediary holding ETHE Shares) as giving rise to income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or proceeds.\n\nFrom and after July 18, 2024 (the \u201cEx-Distribution Date\u201d), ETHE Shares will trade without the right to receive ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution. There is not expected to be a \u201cwhen-issued\u201d market for the ETH Shares prior to the Distribution Date. Following the Initial Distribution, ETHE shareholders as of 4:00 PM ET on July 18, 2024 will automatically see both ETHE Shares and ETH Shares in their portfolios or investment accounts on the Distribution Date.\n\nThe Grayscale team will communicate additional updates, as applicable, including the anticipated Distribution Date, any material updates regarding pending regulatory approval and customary conditions, and the announcement of Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust\u2019s first day of trading on NYSE Arca.\n\n*By AUM as of 6/28/2024\n\nNO OFFER OR SOLICITATION\n\nThis communication is for informational purposes, solely in your capacity as a shareholder of ETHE, and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. No shareholder approval of the Initial Distribution is required by applicable law, and we are not seeking ETHE shareholder approval.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain of the statements contained herein may be statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are based on Grayscale\u2019s views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Grayscale assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained herein and you should not place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

No assurance can be given that the Initial Distribution will occur on Grayscale\u2019s anticipated timeline, or at all.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVICE\n\nThis communication is not intended as, and does not constitute, tax advice. As further discussed in the section of the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE entitled \u201cMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Initial Distribution,\u201d the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution are complex, subject to uncertainty in certain respects and may be affected by circumstances specific to a beneficial owner of ETHE Shares. Any beneficial owner of ETHE Shares who receives ETH Shares in the Initial Distribution, and any intermediary holding ETHE Shares or ETH Shares, should consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Initial Distribution, including the proper allocation of existing tax basis between ETHE Shares and ETH Shares. Please refer to the Preliminary Information Statement filed by ETHE for more information, including other U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Initial Distribution and ownership of the ETH Shares.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT\n\nA definitive information statement on Schedule 14C will be furnished to ETHE shareholders on or after the Record Date for the purpose of informing ETHE shareholders of the Initial Distribution, in substantial compliance with Regulation 14C of the Exchange Act. The information statement will describe the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, risks of owning shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and other details regarding the Initial Distribution, and will be made available on our website at www.grayscale.com/documents#regulatoryfilings.

An investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust should be considered by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of total loss associated with an investment in ETHE or the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Ether, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust and the shares of each trust could lose all or substantially all of their value. Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust depends on the acceptance of the digital assets, the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and the fundamental investment characteristics of the digital asset. Digital asset networks are developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that certain high-profile contributors will no longer contribute to the network could have an adverse effect on the market price of the related digital asset. Digital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital assets. The value of ETHE and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust relate directly to the value of the underlying digital asset, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors.\n\nA registration statement related to Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. An investment in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust cannot be made, nor money accepted, until the registration statement is effective. An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust carefully before investing.

        "content": "Spot Ethereum ETF Nears Launch As Issuers Submit Amended Filings\n\nSeveral asset managers have submitted amended filings to the SEC for the spot Ethereum ETFs. VanEck submitted an amended registration statement for its spot Ethereum ETF, now rebranded as The VanEck Ethereum Trust. Following closely, 21Shares filed a new registration for its spot Ethereum ETFs. Grayscale also joined the fray with two amended filings: one for its $28 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust and another for a more cost-effective \"mini\" ETF.\n\nThe wave of filings continued with Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock each submitting their own amended filings for spot Ethereum ETFs. Notably, none of the filings disclosed planned fees, a detail that Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted the SEC has not yet required. Balchunas suggested that another round of updates including fees is expected before final approvals, predicting a potential approval date around July 18th.\n\nVanEck's amended registration statement saw some regulatory language regarding custody removed. This deleted section had previously described how Ethereum withdrawals would be processed through the entity designated to safeguard assets for the fund. These changes mirrored adjustments made by Bitwise the previous week, which included details on the SEC's stance regarding compliance in the crypto market.\n\nVanEck\u2019s filing also highlighted Gensler's call for federal legislation focused on digital asset trading to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from \"falling between regulatory cracks.\" Similarly, 21Shares\u2019 amended filing included disclosure language on the SEC\u2019s regulatory efforts.\n\nDespite the SEC approving several key filings for spot Ethereum ETFs in May, the regulator still needs to approve S-1 forms from eight asset managers. Gensler has previously stated that the approval process hinges on asset managers' ability to provide full disclosures."

        "content": "News regarding the approval of Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, which could trigger a new bull run in the cryptocurrency market, with the United States SEC playing a crucial role.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nThe SEC at the center of the wait for spot ETFs on Ethereum (ETH): latest news\n\nAs anticipated, Ethereum ETFs are considered a possible spark for a new bull run, but the approval of the US SEC is crucial.\n\nThe regulatory authorities, traders, and investors are eagerly awaiting the presentations of the form S-1 for the spot Ethereum ETFs, which are expected to be available by the weekend.\n\nToday, the entities that have applied for ETH ETFs, including BlackRock, 21Shares, Fidelity and Grayscale, will submit the S-1 forms to the SEC after making the requested changes.\n\nThe first half of 2024 was dominated by the issue of Spot ETFs on Bitcoin. Now, the attention has shifted to ETFs on Ethereum.\n\nNate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, tweeted:\n\n\u201cthe amendments to the ETF S-1 of the spot ETF should be made tomorrow\u2026 How quickly will the SEC be able to reverse course?\u201d\n\nGeraci emphasizes the importance of commissions, adding that the issuers might be ready to launch the products in the coming weeks.\n\nBitwise, an asset management company, has recently updated its S-1 registration with the SEC to list and trade shares of ETH ETFs.\n\nThe CIO of Bitwise, Matt Hougan, predicts that ETH ETFs will attract at least 15 billion dollars in net flows by 2025. Hougan, in particular, states the following:\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to know how much the exchange-traded product (ETP) of ether spot will attract in terms of net flows. My answer: 15 billion dollars in the first 18 months. It is not a random guess. It is what the data suggests.\u201d\n\nFocus on the price of Ethereum\n\nAt the moment, Ether has slightly recovered from last week\u2019s drop, trading at around $3,042. The price has increased by 0.7% in the last 24 hours, but remains 12.2% lower compared to seven days ago.\n\nThe recent history of Bitcoin shows how the approval of the Spot BTC ETF led to a 58% surge in just a few months. On January 10, the day of the approval of the Spot ETF on BTC, the price of Bitcoin was $46,105, rising to $73,097 in March.\n\nThe approval of the Spot ETF on Ethereum could bring the markets back into the green. Based on historical data, the approval of a Spot ETF on ETH could push the price of Ethereum above $4500, assuming a 50% increase.\n\nIn any case, the 1-hour chart of ETH/USD showed a recent bullish trend that started at $2,803, highlighted by a significant bull candle that reached $3,096 before a slight retracement.\n\nA bullish engulfing pattern indicates a possible continuation of this trend, although the recent declines suggest a consolidation phase. The volume analysis reveals a peak during the bullish movement.\n\nHowever, the decreasing volume during the consolidation suggests that, if the volume were to increase again, the bull trend could resume.\n\nOn the 4-hour chart of ETH/USD, Ethereum has confirmed a downward trend recently bouncing from the low of $2,803. A strong increase on July 8 indicates a significant bull movement, potentially suggesting a short-term reversal.\n\nHowever, the recent candles with small bodies and reduced shadows also highlight a certain degree of uncertainty in the market. The volume analysis supports this bullish movement with higher volume, indicating a genuine buying interest.\n\nThe daily chart shows a clear downward trend in the last month, with ETH falling from around $3,889 to a low of $2,803.\n\nContradictory forecasts: analysts divided on the future of Ethereum ETFs\n\nWith the imminent launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) on Ethereum, the financial community is divided on the possible consequences of this debut.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs have led to a significant increase in the price of BTC, analysts are not sure that Ethereum will follow the same path.\n\nRyan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, expressed skepticism regarding the impact of ETFs on Ethereum compared to those on Bitcoin, stating:\n\n\u201cBitcoin and Ethereum are two assets with different fundamentals and a distinct market appeal. When ETFs on Ethereum start trading, ETH will capture about 2.5% of its market capitalization. If this bull scenario were to materialize, the spot ETF on Ethereum could see $11.55 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Galaxy Research predicts that inflows into Ethereum ETFs will be slower compared to those into Bitcoin.\n\nCharles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy, has estimated that \u201cEthereum spot ETPs will see about 5 billion dollars in net inflows in the first five months of trading.\u201d\n\nDespite the moderate expectations of some, other observers are very optimistic about the future of Ethereum post-launch of the ETFs. Steno Research predicts that ETH could reach at least $6,500 by the end of the year, thus surpassing the previous all-time high of ETH by 33%.\n\nStandard Chartered offers an even more bullish forecast. Specifically suggesting that the approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum could lead to up to 45 billion dollars of inflows within the first 12 months. Potentially pushing the price of ETH to $8,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, not everyone shares this optimism. Jupiter Zheng, partner of the Liquid Fund of HashKey Capital, predicts a short and modest initial rally followed by a strong \u201csell-the-news\u201d event.\n\nEvent in which investors might sell their positions after the launch of the ETFs, leading to a price correction."

        "content": "Rome Protocol has secured $9 million in a funding round to integrate modular services from the Solana network into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe protocol stated that its funding round included several notable investors like Hack VC, Polygon Ventures, HashKey, Portal Ventures, Bankless Ventures, Robot VC, LBank, Anagram, TRGC and Perridon Ventures.\n\nThe round also included notable angel investors, such as Solana\u2019s Anatoly Yakovenko and Austin Federa. Other investors included Nick White, Santiago Santos, Comfy Capital, and Jason Yanowitz.\n\nRome protocol\n\nAccording to the protocol, the platform would be designed to integrate Solana\u2019s capabilities into services on Ethereum.\n\nThis approach will allow Ethereum-based rollups to use Solana as a shared sequencer, thereby confirming transactions faster, enhancing privacy and scalability, and reducing blockchain costs.\n\nRome Protocol pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s isolated sequencer feature raises concerns about liquidity fragmentation, weakest link security, and interoperability on the network\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap. Due to this, many rollups rely on centralized sequencers, which risk censorship, limited visibility, and critical downtime.\n\nTo solve these challenges, Rome Protocol will enable rollups to use Solana\u2019s existing validators as shared sequencers for transactions, state maintenance, and transaction publication. This approach aims to turn Solana\u2019s 50,000+ transactions-per-second (TPS) capacity into infrastructure for Ethereum rollups. It also ensures atomic composability with transactions confirmed on Solana before submission to Ethereum.\n\nRome Protocol will allow developers to focus on their applications rather than building new cross-chain interoperability infrastructure. Ethereum developers canuseg familiar technologies like OP Stack for execution and state maintenance.\n\nShared sequencer architecture\n\nThe proposed shared sequencer architecture includes the Rhea, Remus, Romulus, and Hercules features.\n\nRhea will ensure fair sequencing and submission to Solana, while Remus will enhance atomic transactions across rollups.\n\nAccording to the protocol:\n\n\u201cRhea enables fair and blind sequencing of rollup transactions. All transactions are treated equally and processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Remus enables atomic execution of cross-rollup transactions as a premium service.\u201d\n\nRomulus will facilitate atomic transactions across Solana and various rollups, while Hercules will accept ordered transaction blocks from Solana.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Most short-term traders experienced losses and would be eager to exit their positions in case of a price bounce.\n\nThe $2.8k level is likely to be revisited as support, but it is unclear if the bulls can hold on thereafter.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] flow from exchanges took a turn recently and strayed deep into negative territory in June, but this has not turned out the way investors were hoping it would. Instead of appreciating, the prices continued to drop.\n\nBearish sentiment was prevalent in the market, as seen by the price drop below $3k. This psychological level is likely to be contested hard, but the selling pressure behind ETH has been unforgiving.\n\nWhale accumulation did little to halt bearish trend\n\nIn June, the 7-day simple moving average of the exchange netflow dropped deep into the negative territory. It stayed negative till the 28th of June.\n\nIn the past ten days, it has crept into the positive territory, accompanying the sharp price drop seen in July.\n\nThe negative netflow indicated Ethereum tokens moving outside of exchanges and signaled accumulation. Despite this, the prices continued to slump.\n\nInvestors would be hoping that this is the final jolt of pain before the trend turns bullish.\n\nThe supply distribution analysis showed that the 10k-1M ETH holders have increased since mid-May. The 1k-10k ETH wallets moved higher toward the end of June but have fallen lower again over the past week.\n\nTogether it indicated the large whales with 10k+ ETH accumulated, but most other wallets have reduced their holdings.\n\nWhere can traders expect prices to find relief?\n\nAMBCrypto noted from the in/out of the money data that the $2850-$3000 zone was a strong support zone due to the number of holders.\n\nOver the past three days, the price decline to $2.8k saw a bounce to $3k but it is unclear if the buyers can withstand the sellers\u2019 onslaught any longer.\n\nAround the current market price, 60.25% of the addresses were out of the money, which meant that price bounces would likely be sold as holders look to exit at break-even. This can add to the downward pressure.\n\nThe MobChart data outlined large limit orders on the order books for Ethereum. The $3100 and $3170 levels have $3.7 million worth of limit orders. Above them, the $3220-$3250 region and $3500 have just over $5 million, marking these as strong short-term resistances.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe $2800 level has just under $10 million worth of buy orders and might be tested once again. Overall, the metrics show that in the short term, bears were in control.\n\nThe exchange outflow in June did little to halt the price decline, and the best bulls can hope for now is a period of consolidation around the psychological $3k support."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF issuers have begun filing amended S-1 drafts following the SEC's July 8 deadline.\n\nEthereum long-term holders are depositing to exchanges despite potential rally from ETH ETF launch.\n\nEthereum shows signs of recovery after failing to push below key support level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down 0.3% on Monday as prospective spot ETH ETF issuers returned their amended S-1 registration statements to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, ETH long-term holders are gradually returning to the market after years on the sidelines.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Ethereum ETF Issuers files updated S-1s\n\nAsset managers VanEck, Grayscale, Fidelity, BlackRock, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have all filed their amended spot ETH ETF S-1 registration statements with the SEC on Monday following the regulator's July 8 deadline for issuers to return their amended drafts.\n\nSeveral top analysts expect the SEC to approve the drafts within the next two weeks as issuers have already completed most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe SEC approved issuers' spot ETH ETF 19b-4 applications on May 23 but also need to greenlight their S-1s before they can begin trading.\n\nDespite the positives from a potential ETH ETF launch, on-chain data shows that a few ETH long-term holders (LTHs) are slowly returning to the market. According to Lookonchain, Golem, which raised 820,000 ETH for $10.12 per coin during its ICO \u2014 has moved 26K ETH worth $78 million to an address. In turn, the address sends the ETH to exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex and Coinbase.\n\nSpot On Chain also reported that a whale who had held onto its tokens for about 1.5 years moved 7,240 ETH worth $21.4 million to Kraken exchange at an estimated profit of $12.8 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Immuenfi and the Ethereum Foundation announced the launch of Attackathon, a time-boxed audit competition aimed at improving Ethereum's security. Attackathon would also feature an educational program to boost security researchers' understanding of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has seeded the event's reward pool with an initial $500,000 while calling on sponsors in its ecosystem to contribute.\n\nETH technical analysis: Is this the beginning of a recovery?\n\nEthereum traded around $2,975 on Monday, down about 0.3% on the day. ETH's slight increase earlier in the day saw shorts suffer over $49 million in liquidations, with long liquidations slowing down to around $44 million, according to Coinglass data.\n\nETH retested the support around $2,800 to $2,852 again on Sunday but failed to sustain an extended move below it for the second consecutive time as prices quickly bounced above the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nAs mentioned in a previous analysis, this level has proven to be a crucial support during downtrends experienced in April and May. Hence, ETH will likely continue to face strong buying demand around the $2,852 support level.\n\nThe chart also shows ETH posted a double bottom, a pattern that signifies potential seller exhaustion due to failure to break below a key support level \u2014 $2,800 to $2,852 in this case.\n\nETH could repeat the pattern it followed between April 12 and May 21, where it crashed from $3,550 before sustaining a horizontal movement for a while and then spiked following the SEC's U-turn to approve 19b-4 filings of spot ETH ETF issuers. If ETH repeats such a move, it may consolidate for a few days and then see a potential spike when spot ETH ETFs begin trading on exchanges.\n\nETH Liquidation Heatmap\n\nIn the short term, ETH could briefly move to the $3,104 price level, where there is a liquidation wall of $2.94 million."

        "content": "Crypto firm Galaxy Digital is forecasting how Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will stack up to Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nAccording to a new research post from Charles Yu, the firm\u2019s vice president of research, Ethereum ETFs will see roughly one-third of the inflows of similar Bitcoin products.\n\nTo reach their estimate, Yu says the firm compared the two assets\u2019 market cap, open interest levels and volume in futures markets, and the total assets under management (AUM) across existing funds.\n\n\u201cBased on the above, we think that ether spot ETF inflows will be approximately 3x less than US spot bitcoin ETF inflows (in line with the cap multiple) with a range of 2x to 5x. In other words, we think that ether spot ETF inflows could be 33% the size of US spot bitcoin ETF inflows with a range of 20% to 50% of size in dollars.\n\nApplying this multiple to $15bn of bitcoin spot ETF inflows through June 15 would imply monthly ETH ETF inflows of ~$1.0bn for the first five months following ether ETF approval and launch (est. range: $600m to $1.5bn / per month)\u2026\u201d\n\nYu further asserts that ETH ETFs should have an overall positive impact on the ETH markets for three main reasons:\n\n\u201c(i) expanded accessibility across wealth segments,\n\n(ii) greater acceptance through formal recognition by regulators and trusted financial services brands. An ETF enables greater reach for both retail and institutions, provides wider distribution through more investment channels, and can support the case for ether in a portfolio to be used across more investment strategies.\n\nIn addition, a greater understanding of Ethereum by financial professionals would ideally result in accelerated investments and adoption of the technology.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Currently, the state of the crypto market can be expressed as extremely bearish, with a notably negative impact on the Ethereum token ecosystem. This sentiment is captured by the Fear and Greed Index, which hit a low of 20, an extreme level of fear prevailing in the market.\n\nThe volatility surrounding virtual assets has instilled fear among investors, resulting in a rush to exit and, consequently, a fall in price.\n\nThis is not the first time Ethereum tokens have dipped from the \u2018fear factor,\u2019 but RCO Finance (RCOF) offers safety for the Ethereum ecosystem. Let\u2019s examine past episodes of extreme market fear and how Ethereum tokens persevered through them.\n\nExtreme Fear Grips the Crypto Market\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a preferable sentiment tracker, has fallen to levels last observed in the second half of 2022. It currently stands at 26, pointing more towards a side of extreme fear in the market rather than extreme greed.\n\nThis shift in sentiment stems from several factors: The future decline of Mt. Gox, Germany\u2019s decision to sell some of the Bitcoins, and macroeconomic factors. This has caused major crypto prices to drop, and Bitcoin and Ethereum have recently been worst affected.\n\nIt is important to note that panic has been witnessed in the crypto market before, indicating that previous events can help understand the current situation.\n\nPrevious Instances of Extreme Fear in the Crypto Market\n\nExtreme fear has occurred in the crypto market at some point in the past, and such events reveal possible tendencies regarding how the market will respond this time.\n\nThe 2022 Crypto Winter\n\nThe most recent extreme fear of cryptocurrencies was experienced during the 2022 crypto winter. \u201cInfluenced by factors such as regulatory risk, macroeconomic issues, and the failure of projects such as Terra/LUNA, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to levels not observed since the bear market 2018.\n\nDuring this period, the ether price dropped, and almost all the newly developed Ethereum altcoins faced a decline in value. However, the market emerged, so the Ethereum community became active and started using Ethereum and its altcoins.\n\nThe 2018 Bitcoin Crash\n\nOne other major example of the extreme rear in the crypto market is the 2018 Bitcoin crash. Bitcoin and other forms of crypto surged in late 2017, and Bitcoin rose almost to $20000.\n\nBut it was succeeded by sharp declines, with Bitcoin\u2019s value falling to less than 20% of its preceding value. During this period, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reached lower lows as demands for digital currency plummeted due to a bearish trend.\n\nHowever, good sense prevailed, and the market finally calmed down as the crypto ecosystem grew and developed further.\n\nNavigating the Uncertain Landscape\n\nAs the broader cryptocurrency landscape grapples with uncertainty, a glimmer of hope emerges from the past \u2013 the last time such fear gripped the market, the Ethereum altcoin sector staged a remarkable rebound. As the crypto world shifts, one project, RCO Finance (RCOF), is ready to capitalize on this shift in sentiment.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF): \u201cA Beacon of Hope\u201d\n\nBuilt on the Ethereum blockchain, the RCOF token benefits from the network\u2019s growing adoption and strong infrastructure. As the market stabilizes, RCOF offers a promising opportunity for investors seeking stability in Ethereum tokens. It serves as the native currency of the RCO Finance platform.\n\nRCO Finance is a crypto AI trading platform with features like AI robo-advisor tools, Debit cards for fiat conversions, and DeFi lending.\n\nRCO Finance\u2019s goal is to provide a comprehensive platform with a wide range of assets and an interactive system. This ambitious aim and the project\u2019s innovative features have generated significant excitement among crypto enthusiasts, who see it as a potential beacon in the current market.\n\nSeize the Opportunity for a Promised $3000 ROI\n\nThe RCO Finance presale is now live at $0.0127 per token, offering early investors the prospect of significant returns. The Ethereum token is expected to list between $0.4 and $0.6, potentially delivering a 3000% ROI. An initial $50 investment could grow to $1500 at launch.\n\nThe Ethereum token is safeguarded against pump-and-dump schemes and liquidity issues through advanced tokenomics to ensure stability. Additionally, SolidProof, a renowned security firm, has audited the token\u2019s smart contract for security and integrity.\n\nDon\u2019t be a victim of FOMO\u2014invest in RCO Finance (RCOF) today!\n\nFor more information about the RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale:\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored post.

        "content": "Ethereum ICO participants moved a significant amount of their holdings.\n\nWhale interest and retail interest in ETH declined.\n\nDue to the rising bearish sentiment in the market, the price of Ethereum [ETH] declined significantly, dipping below the $3,000 mark.\n\nInitial coin offering\n\nIn November 2016, the Golem project conducted a successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO), raising a significant sum of 820,000 ETH.\n\nOver a 37-day period, Golem transferred 36,000 ETH to major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance [BNB], Coinbase, and Bitfinex. This transfer amounted to roughly $115 million.\n\nDespite these transfers, Golem still held a substantial amount of ETH, with a press time balance of 231,400 ETH, valued at approximately $656 million.\n\nThis indicates that Golem maintained a strong financial position and may be strategically planning for future developments.\n\nWhen a large amount of cryptocurrency hits exchanges, it creates sell pressure. This means that more ETH is available for purchase, potentially exceeding current demand and driving the price down.\n\nMoreover, a large holder like Golem moving their ETH to exchanges can trigger speculation in the market.\n\nInvestors might interpret this as a sign that Golem believes the price of ETH is about to fall, leading them to sell their own holdings to avoid losses. This can create a snowball effect, pushing the price further down.\n\nThe sell-off of these tokens wasn\u2019t an isolated event. AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data indicated that large addresses were losing interest in ETH and their holdings had declined.\n\nCoupled with that, retail interest had also decreased over the last few days. This indicated a potential lack of overall demand across different investor segments, further increasing sell pressure.\n\nNew developments on the Ethereum network\n\nDespite these factors, development on the Ethereum network continued to soar.\n\nEthereum developers recently held an online meeting to discuss the Pectra upgrade, a major update for the Ethereum blockchain. The upcoming Pectra Devnet 1 launch is on hold waiting for other software updates.\n\nResearchers presented ways to improve data collection on the software diversity used to run Ethereum. Additionally, they debated a new feature to prevent software bugs from disrupting the network.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe meeting also included discussions about potentially including further changes in the future, but no final decisions were made.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $2,914.63 and its price had fallen by 3.19% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Mon 08 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe crypto community holds its breath as the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs seems imminent. Matrixport expects a favorable decision this week. The stakes are high: validation of the ETFs could propel Ethereum to new heights and bolster confidence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe SEC is Ready to Give the Green Light to Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe wait for the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum ETFs is sparking significant interest in the crypto world. Matrixport, a key player in the sector, claims that the probability of swift approval is high, based on precedents of rapid SEC approvals. Investors remember that the SEC has recently approved Form 19-b filings with unusual speed, fueling current optimism.\n\nFinancial giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are already preparing to submit their S-1 forms, anticipating that ETF approval could come sooner than expected. This perspective is reinforced by statements from Nate Geraci, President of ETFstore, who noted that the adjustments requested by the SEC in previous reviews were minor. According to him, this suggests that ETFs could begin trading within two weeks of approval. Bloomberg experts even predict approval as early as July 15.\n\nGrowth Prospects for ETH with ETFs\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC could have profound repercussions on the crypto market. Matrixport anticipates a significant rise in Ethereum\u2019s price, potentially up to 3,400 USD following this approval. This forecast is based on an analysis of historical price movements, where substantial increases followed similar SEC decisions. Investor confidence and market activity are likely to intensify with the launch of ETFs, creating an environment conducive to price increases.\n\nDespite the current bearish market context, Bernstein, an asset management firm, has set a long-term price target of 6,600 USD for Ethereum. This optimism relies on growing institutional interest and the potential for post-approval ETF growth. Historical precedents show that assets like Bitcoin have experienced significant rallies after comparable regulatory approvals, reinforcing the belief that Ethereum could follow a similar trajectory.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading around 3,000 USD, with a trading volume up 57% in the last 24 hours. These figures indicate renewed interest and increased speculative activity as investors anticipate imminent regulatory decisions. The critical levels to watch are the support at 2,900 USD and the resistance at 3,100 USD, whose respective breaks could signal significant price movements.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "In a recent revelation by blockchain research firm TRM Labs, cryptocurrency thefts have seen a drastic increase in the first half of 2024, amounting to a whopping $1.38 billion.\n\nWhat Happened: The volume of stolen cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (CRYPTO: Ether) and Dogecoin DOGE/USD, in the first half of 2024 has doubled in comparison to the same period in 2023, CNBC reported on Tuesday. The report by TRM Labs disclosed that hackers made away with $1.38 billion worth of crypto from Jan. 1 to June 24, marking a significant rise from the $657 million stolen during the same timeframe a year ago.\n\nThe five largest hacks accounted for 70% of the total amount stolen in the first half of 2024. The most substantial theft involved over $300 million worth of Bitcoin BTC/USD from the Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the constant number of attacks, the report noted that the crypto ecosystem\u2019s security hasn\u2019t seen any significant changes that could have led to the increase in thefts. However, the firm pointed out that higher crypto prices in the first half of 2024 could have contributed to the increased value of stolen crypto.\n\nCrypto firms are advised to adopt a multi-layered defense strategy, including regular security audits and robust encryption, to combat hacks and exploits. TRM Labs also recommended educating employees and implementing a comprehensive incident response strategy.\n\nSee Also: Peter Schiff Says Bitcoin ETF Buyers \u2018HODLing\u2019 Amid King Crypto\u2019s Plunge But Warns \u2018Much Larger Drop \u2026May Come As Soon As Next Week\u2019\n\nWhy It Matters: Earlier this year, phishers stole $47 million in crypto, primarily through fake accounts on Elon Musk\u2018s social media platform X. The victims were primarily lured to phishing websites through comments made by impersonator accounts on X.\n\nIn May, the popular Web3 game Gala Games was hacked, resulting in a loss of $214 million. The hacker exploited a loophole on the platform and minted 5 billion GALA tokens, which were worth $214 million at the time of the exploit.\n\nThe theft of Bitcoin mining machines has also been making headlines in July. Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin advocate, highlighted two significant busts involving the theft of Bitcoin mining equipment, questioning the robbers\u2019 objectives.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage via Shutterstock"

Following the recent market sell-off, the ETH price found suitable support at $2815\u2014 a multi-month horizontal level intact in February 2024.

The aforementioned level aligned closely with 50W EMA and 23.6% FIB creating a high area of interest for buyers.\n\nIn the last 48 hours, the Ether price jumped 8.76% to trade at $3071, while the market cap jumped to $370.2 Billion.

        "content": "Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted on X that July 18 would be the \u201cbest guess\u201d for the spot Ethereum ETF launch.\n\nThis comes after the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) issued S-1 amendments, which required companies to amend their registration statements and submit their applications.\n\nBalchunas Notes Minimal Changes in Latest Filing\n\nIn the latest series of amendments filed by asset managers regarding spot Ethereum ETFs, Eric Balchunas described the changes as minimal, noting that there was \u201cnothing to see here\u201d in two of the earliest filings.\n\nBecause the SEC asked for the S-1s on July 8th but told issuers the fee wasn\u2019t nec yet. They will give guidance back to issuers soon along with the game plan. Then the docs come will come back with fees (and every other blank) filled it and then it\u2019s Go time. https://t.co/S4u8HaMckh \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2024\n\nThe recent S-1 and S-3 amendments pertain to asset managers\u2019 ability to issue ETFs. This differs from the 19b-4 filings that permit exchanges to list and trade these funds upon launch.\n\nOn Monday, VanEck initiated the wave of amendments by submitting an updated registration statement for its spot Ethereum ETF, renaming the product as The VanEck Ethereum Trust. This was promptly followed by 21Shares, which also filed a new registration for its spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nGrayscale joined the trend with two amended filings: one for its substantial $28 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust and another for a more cost-effective \u201cmini\u201d version of the trust. Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock also filed amended registration statements for their respective spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nDespite these updates, none of the filings on Monday disclosed the planned fees for the ETFs. Balchunas mentioned that the SEC had yet to mandate this information, suggesting that a final round of updates, including fee details, would precede the launch, after which \u201cit\u2019s go time.\u201d\n\nCompanies Update ETH ETF Filings\n\nRecent amendments have brought some minor changes. VanEck\u2019s registration statement saw the removal of specific regulatory language regarding custody, particularly a section that described how Ethereum withdrawals would be managed through the fund\u2019s chosen custodian.\n\nIn addition, other minor changes align with those made by Bitwise the previous week, reflecting the SEC\u2019s stance on compliance within the crypto market. These sections emphasize SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s concern about inadequate protection for investors using crypto exchanges and highlight the potential implications for securities laws.\n\nSimilarly, 21Shares included disclosure language in its amended registration statement regarding the SEC\u2019s regulatory efforts and other minor details.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s updated filing for its \u201cmini\u201d Ethereum ETF introduced a new section clarifying that none of the Ethereum in the product will be staked. This refers to the process where Ethereum tokens are delegated to the network in exchange for rewards.\n\nNotably, none of the applications before the SEC include plans for Ethereum staking, and some applicants have preemptively removed related language from their proposals."

        "title": "Must Buy Ethereum Meme Coins Before the ETH ETF Approval - CoinGape",
        "content": "The recent hype around the potential ETH ETF is causing investors to scout for Ethereum meme coins to invest in for maximum profits. Ethereum price prediction shows the ETF news is not yet priced in. Furthermore, ETH seems to be following Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory following its ETF approval. BTC\u2019s price retraced after its ETF news before surging to $73,000.\n\nEthereum is a huge network and meme coins are famous for being the best runners during impactful market news. However, not all meme coins are winners. Here are three meme coins to buy before the Ethereum ETF gets approval in July.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. Ethereum Meme Coins \u2013 Turbo (TURBO)\n\nTurbo is the first AI-scripted meme coin in the history of cryptocurrencies. The token, which was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, was created using only a budget of $69 and following guidance from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The community came in later and crowd-funded the initial liquidity required to launch the project, as the previous $69 was not enough. Turbo is therefore a community token, riding both the meme coin and artificial intelligence (AI) narratives in this bull run.\n\nThe price of TURBO today is $0.003809, a 6.7% drop in the last 24 hours following Bitcoin\u2019s sell-off. Turbo did well following its launch, hitting an all-time high of $0.009632 two months ago before retracing. TURBO\u2019s market cap is currently at $294 million\u2014enough to surge 10\u201320X and transform investors\u2019 portfolios. TURBO\u2019s 24-hour trading volume is down 16.2% as market participants refrain from trading during these market conditions.\n\nThe AI revolution in the crypto industry is picking up fast, and more so within the Ethereum meme coin ecosystem. Turbo and a few other AI based meme coins may be the first runners if Ethereum gets a win with ETF approval. The current price retrace sets TURBO in an optimal buy-in position.\n\n2. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe is among the top list of the giant Ethereum meme coins that started as a joke, before quickly garnering popularity. The meme coin was inspired by Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. Furie is also the creator of several other memes on the Ethereum chain, namely, Landwolf, Andy (ETH), Bird-Dog, and Fofar. By extension, these meme coins have the potential to soar along with PEPE.\n\nThe price of PEPE today is $0.000009162, which represents a drop of 2.1% in the last 24 hours. Sitting at a market cap of $3.8 billion, Pepe has fallen by over 50% from its all-time high market cap. This is just an indicator of how volatile meme coins can be.\n\nDespite this fall in price and valuation, the number of Pepe holders is up over 5% in the last month and $0.01% in the last 24 hours per Santiment.\n\nAdditionally, the 24-hour trading volume for Pepe is down by 32% which shows there has been a decrease in market activity.\n\nPEPE price showcased incredible price performance following the announcement of the approval of Ethereum ETF 19-4b forms. Even though this approval was not the real thing since it could be contested, Pepe\u2019s price still soared and hit an all-time high price of $0.00001665 on May 28 before beginning to retrace.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki is one of the older meme coins that came out right after Shiba Inu\u2019s rise to popularity. Having been around for three years, Floki\u2019s creation drew inspiration from Elon Musk but has since transformed from just a meme coin to a recognizable brand all over the world. Floki has over 480,000 holders and boasts multiple partnerships with sports clubs, DeFi protocols, and popular blockchain companies.\n\nFloki price is trading at $0.000149, a 2.4% price surge in the last 24 hours. The meme coin has had three major peaks in its lifetime, one in November 2021 and the other two within the March-June period. The price action of Floki formed a potential double top, which may result in a further drop in price to $0.00003500. If the current support holds, Floki may enter into a consolidation zone between $0.00033 and $0.00015.\n\nBeing an ERC20 meme coin with a large holder base, Floki may be one of the top Ethereum meme coins to run hard in the case of an ETF approval.\n\n4. Apu Apustaja\n\nApu Apustaja is a recent meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. It gained popularity on the anonymous chatting platform 4Chan and quickly rose to prominence, hitting a $28 million market cap. However, the developer began dumping their holdings and eventually abandoned the project near its all-time lows. In response, the community took over the project, driving it to a new all-time high market cap of $311 million on May 21.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Apu hovered around $0.000494, marking a 16.6% increase in the last 24 hours. Apu is one of the few tokens to rebound with double-digit gains following Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. The meme coin found support around the $100 million mark and has tested this level twice in the past three weeks.\n\nCommunity takeovers (CTOs) are becoming a prominent narrative in this bull cycle, and Apu exemplifies this trend through its price history. With the potential for further market recovery, Apu shows promise for future price surges, especially if the Ethereum ETF receives approval.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe potential Ethereum ETF approval anticipation fuels interest in ERC20 meme tokens like Pepe, Floki, and Turbo. These Ethereum meme coins command attention for their ability to potentially return high rewards in a short period of time. As we approach the expected decision day, price volatility in the crypto market may increase.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Whe will ETH ETF be approved? According to speculations, an ETH ETF approval is expected around mid-June. 2. Can Ethereum reach 6,000? Some analysts say that Ethereum can pump to 6,600 after ETH ETF approval. 3.

        "content": "Buterin\u2019s transfer amid market downturn sparked speculation on ETH\u2019s sentiment impact.\n\nETH held steady with moderate losses, contrasting sharply with other cryptocurrencies\u2019 declines.\n\nEthereum [ETH] co-founder Vitalik Buterin sparked intense speculation within the crypto community with a significant transfer.\n\nMany investors assumed that Buterin was making a strategic move or possibly selling some of his holdings.\n\nClearing the air around Buterin\u2019s move\n\nHowever, things got clear when Wu Blockchain shared more details.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin\u2019s move coincided with a broader market downturn, as the global crypto market cap hit $2.05 trillion at press time, down 2.67% in the past day.\n\nNow, whether Buterin\u2019s move will shift ETH\u2019s market sentiment from bearish to bullish remains to be seen.\n\nAs of the latest update, the largest altcoin was trading at $2,946.55, reflecting a 1.98% decline over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis decline is relatively moderate compared to Bitcoin [BTC], which dropped by 2.40%. Solana [SOL] and Ripple [XRP] experienced declines exceeding 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nBut despite the recent market decline, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis using IntoTheBlock data indicated that buying pressure continued to exceed selling pressure among bulls and bears.\n\nIs crypto adoption on the rise?\n\nNeedless to say, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs has pushed Bitcoin into the spotlight. Of late, the king coin has attracted attention from Wall Street, major institutions, and the political sphere.\n\nWhile this surge is often seen as a step forward for cryptocurrency adoption, it primarily revolves around Bitcoin rather than the broader crypto market.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Buterin\u2019s recent actions could boost ETH adoption, especially considering investors\u2019 losing interest in ETH fueled by the delay in ETH ETF approval by the SEC.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s financial influence\n\nAccording to a recent report published by on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, Vitalik Buterin remains the largest individual holder of ETH.\n\nHis net worth has climbed from $552.86 million at the start of 2024 to $834.66 million.\n\nHis holdings of approximately 245,279 ETH fluctuate with Ethereum\u2019s market prices.\n\nDuring the 2021 bull market peak, ETH\u2019s value propelled his net worth above $2 billion, though subsequent downturns in 2022 reduced it by about 75%.\n\nDespite market volatility, Buterin\u2019s strategic investments and pivotal role in Ethereum continue to solidify his financial influence."

        "title": "Crypto: Ethereum Falls Below $3,000 - Fears Rise - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jul 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fell below $3,000 for the first time in 50 days, causing a shockwave among crypto investors. This drop raises questions about the future of the market.\n\nA drop marked by massive liquidations\n\nThe decline of Ethereum to $2,871 is part of a broader correction in the crypto market. On July 5, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $2 trillion, a level unseen since February. This widespread decline also affected Bitcoin (BTC), which fell to $54,953.\n\nThe reasons for this drop are multiple. The bankruptcy of Mt. Gox transferred 47,229 bitcoins, worth $2.6 billion, to a new address, increasing selling pressure on the market.\n\nAdditionally, the German government has transferred 7,583 BTC to exchanges since June 19, further adding to this pressure with a total value of $415 million.\n\nThese movements have led to massive liquidations of long positions, including $235 million in Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nThis increased selling context has therefore exacerbated the market correction, raising fears of the end of the recent cryptocurrency bull run.\n\nVolatility: a double-edged sword\n\nVolatility is an inherent characteristic of the crypto market. While it can offer significant gain opportunities, it also carries major risks. Traders who were hoping for stability post-ETF launches are facing a very different reality.\n\nThe famous economist and crypto-skeptic Peter Schiff recently predicted a drop of Ethereum to $1,500. This forecast, although pessimistic, reflects growing concerns within the crypto community.\n\nSchiff points out that Ethereum is going through critical support levels, and the recent drop below $3,000 seems to prove him right.\n\nHowever, not everything is bleak. Franklin Templeton, a global asset manager, published an optimistic report on Ethereum, highlighting its technological advancements and economic potential.\n\nThis perspective contrasts sharply with Schiff\u2019s predictions, illustrating the duality of opinions surrounding Ethereum.\n\nPerspectives and resilience of the ETH crypto\n\nDespite the recent correction, Ethereum derivative indicators show relative resilience.\n\nMonthly futures contracts are trading at a premium, although this has fallen from 11% to 8% recently. This relative stability suggests that professional traders are not preparing for significant further declines.\n\nMoreover, the upcoming launch of an Ethereum spot ETF in the United States could offer a positive dynamic. The approval of this ETF could attract new institutional investors, thereby strengthening Ethereum\u2019s position in the market.\n\nIt is important to note that, although short-term predictions are uncertain, Ethereum and its crypto continue to play a central role in the decentralized economy. Its capabilities as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts remain unmatched, offering long-term growth prospects.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "ETH/BTC Price Prediction: Is Ethereum Price Reversing or Is It a Bull Trap? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price increased by 5.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $3,070 during European business hours. The increase comes against the backdrop of Germany\u2019s continued Bitcoin sell-off. BTC also saw an increase of 3.4% over the last 24 hours, and is trading at $57,189.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price To Rebound If This Happens\n\nETH price broke below a falling channel on Thursday last week, a non-bullish move on its part. Ethereum price plummeted to a low of $2,811 as Bitcoin continued to bleed. However, ETH price found another support below around $2,815, using it as a cushion against the fall. The price of ETH consolidated around this local bottom over the weekend before showing some renewed strength on Monday going into Tuesday.\n\nThe Ethereum price action has revisited the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is currently acting as a resistance. If Ethereum breaks above this key indicator, market sentiment may turn to bullish.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the asset may likely break above the 200-day SMA but succumb to the overhead 50-day SMA, falling into a consolidation zone between $3,371 and $2,811. This will also put it back into the falling channel.\n\nIf ETH bulls can exert more power, they can break above the falling channel and the potential consolidation zone to hit the previous yearly high of $3,967. On the flip side, if the bears prevail, ETH price may break below the $2,815 support and drop lower to $2,200, with temporary cushioning around $2,490.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin price hit a low of $53,550 in the recent sell-off (which may still be in play) before bouncing back, as data from CoinGecko shows. The asset seems to have found support around the $55,000 level, though history suggests this may not hold for long. If BTC continues to fall, the next major support is around $50,000, and below that, $46,000.\n\nWhy is Ethereum Price Rising?\n\nThe markets today have spots of green, with Ethereum among the biggest gainers. VanEck was the last to file an S-1 for its spot Ethereum ETF yesterday, indicating a high likelihood of ETF approval soon. As of July 9, 2024, all spot Ethereum ETF applicants have filed their updated S-1s.\n\nMeanwhile, while Germany continues to sell Bitcoin indiscriminately, ETFs saw $384 million in inflows last week, showing that investors are using the fear in the market to get exposed to BTC at discounted prices.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum\u2019s price movement shows signs of a potential reversal, but uncertainty lingers as market participants debate whether this uptick represents a genuine trend change or a deceptive bull trap. Close monitoring of key indicators may provide clarity on whether ETH can sustain its momentum relative to BTC in the coming days.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Which firms have filed for Spot Ethereum ETF? Grayscale, VanEck Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Bitwise have all submitted filings for a spot Ethereum ETF. 2. When will Spot Ethereum ETF launch? Speculations say that Ethereum ETF will launch mid-July. 3. Can Ethereum reach $5000? According to analysis, after the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF, ETH could rally to $6,600.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Binance, Ethereum, Solana and Ripple: The biggest crypto news of the past week - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Mon 08 Jul 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nBetween groundbreaking announcements, technological advancements, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a limitless territory of innovation and a battlefield of regulatory and economic conflicts. Here is a summary of the most notable news of the past week surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.\n\nMt. Gox: The creditors\u2019 reimbursement after ten years of waiting\n\nAfter a decade of legal battles and complex procedures, the former bitcoin exchange platform Mt. Gox is finally starting to reimburse its creditors. Founded in 2010 and handling up to 70% of global bitcoin transactions at its peak, Mt. Gox went bankrupt in 2014 following the loss of 850,000 BTC due to a security breach. Reimbursements are made in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) via designated exchanges, with 47,288 BTC already transferred for reimbursements. Creditors must confirm the validity of their accounts to receive their compensation. However, this news has had disastrous repercussions on the crypto market, leading to massive liquidations reaching $675 million in 24 hours, primarily due to the sale of the newly reimbursed BTC, which could intensify sales and put pressure on the price of bitcoin.\n\nEthereum introduces EIP-7732 and shifts into high gear\n\nEthereum developers have introduced EIP-7732, a proposal aimed at revolutionizing block validation on the blockchain by separating the process into two parts: consensus and execution. This initiative, supported by Vitalik Buterin, proposes the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS), which divides block creation between a consensus proposer and an execution proposer, with the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC) overseeing the timings. The goal is to reduce the computational load of validators, thus increasing the efficiency and speed of transactions, now confirmed between five and twenty seconds. This advancement could strengthen Ethereum\u2019s competitive position, requiring a complete network upgrade and community approval.\n\nPanic in the crypto market: Bitcoin and Ethereum collapse\n\nA shockwave hit the crypto world last week, with a sudden drop of 8% for Bitcoin and over 10% for Ethereum in a few hours. This dramatic plunge led to massive liquidations of $580 million, notably on heavily leveraged bullish positions that couldn\u2019t withstand the price drop. The massive fund movement from Mt. Gox, transferring over $2.7 billion in bitcoins to a new address in anticipation of reimbursements, intensified the selling pressure. Meanwhile, the liquidation of part of Germany\u2019s bitcoin holdings added to the uncertainty. Traders, already nervous about macroeconomic uncertainties and upcoming US presidential elections, reacted by selling off their positions massively, leading to significant losses. This increased volatility plunged the fear and greed index to alarming levels, leaving the market\u2019s short-term outlook uncertain.\n\nSolana sets new records with its memecoins\n\nThe memecoin universe on Solana is experiencing unprecedented excitement and has recorded performances exceeding all expectations. After a rocky start, Solana has managed to establish itself as a key player in the meme crypto sector, surpassing Ethereum by 800% since the beginning of the year. This success is attributed to Solana\u2019s ability to attract talented developers and create an environment conducive to the growth of memecoins. Meme cryptos like Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Billy (BILLY) have contributed to this rise, with Dogwifhat soaring by 12.34% in 24 hours and Billy seeing its market cap explode by 97% to reach $117 million. The Solana community, technological innovations, as well as the support of celebrities and investors have been key factors in this dynamic. Solana now dominates the memecoin sector with a market share of 9.64%.\n\nRipple teams up with crypto exchange Binance to counter the SEC\n\nRipple is taking advantage of a recent court decision in favor of Binance to strengthen its defense in its litigation against the SEC. On June 28, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia partially dismissed the SEC\u2019s accusations that certain cryptocurrency sales by Binance were equivalent to securities sales. Ripple quickly seized this opportunity, noting that the court adopted logic similar to that of Judge Analisa Torres in its case against the SEC in July 2023. Judge Amy Berman Jackson distinguished secondary market sales from institutional sales, criticizing the SEC\u2019s approach of regulating the bitcoin and alternative crypto industry through litigation without providing regulatory clarity. Ripple sees these observations as supporting its argument on the necessity of clarifying the legal status of cryptos, questioning the severity of the penalties demanded by the SEC.\n\nDiscover our newsletter This link uses an affiliate program.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ethereum sellers return after brief break: ETH to $2,800 next? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Sellers have taken over Ethereum price direction, suggesting that price might fall below $3,000.\n\nThe one-day Realized Cap dropped, indicating that the market might lose confidence if the trend persists.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] risks falling below $3,000 for the second time in a few days. This was according to the data AMBCrypto obtained from the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD).\n\nOn the daily chart ETH/USD, the spot CVD had dropped to the negative region. The CVD tracks the difference between the buying and selling volume of a cryptocurrency over some time.\n\nBuyers struggle to sustain the pressure\n\nWhen the value is positive, more holders are buying than those selling. Sustaining this means that the price of the cryptocurrency might increase in the short-term. However, when it is negative, it means that sellers are dominant.\n\nIn a situation like this, it becomes difficult for prices to increase. At press time, the price of the altcoin was $3,012. Before that, ETH had attempted to flip $3,100, but bears rejected the move.\n\nHowever, apart from the CVD, other metric revealed that it could take some time before the cryptocurrency fully recovers.\n\nOne of such datasets is the Mean Coin Age (MCA). The MCA is the average age of coins on a blockchain. When it increases, it means that old coins are moving back into circulation, thereby, increasing the potential of a sell-off.\n\nBut a decrease in the coin age implies that holders are refraining from selling. Instead, they are opting to keep their assets in non-custodial wallets.\n\nMore old coins, more problem\n\nAs of this writing, ETH\u2019s 90-day MCA had moved from 36.50 to 37.12. This increase implies a rise in trading activity involving the cryptocurrency.\n\nSince the price fell from the value on the 6th of July, it implies that most of the exchange ended in a sale.\n\nIf this continues, the price of ETH could slip below $3,000. Also, if buying pressure fails to match up with the increase, the price might drop to $2,881 like it did on the 5th.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Realized Cap aligned with the forecast. Realized Cap represents that the value of each coin when it last moved compared to its trading value.\n\nAs a measure of the collective cost basis, the one-day Realized Cap dropped to $559.45 million. This decrease implies that ETH had plunged some holders into unrealized losses.\n\nIf this persists, the broader market might lose confidence in Ethereum, possibly prompting low demand for the cryptocurrency. Should this be the case, the price might fall as stated earlier.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nInterestingly, this decrease also presents a buying opportunity as long as ETH remains in a bull market.\n\nHowever, the fruits of this change might not reflect in a few days or weeks. But in the long term, ETH\u2019s price looks likely to jump."

        "content": "Justin Sun Announces Gas-Free Stablecoin Solution for Tron and Ethereum\n\nTron founder Justin Sun has announced his team's development of a gas-free stablecoin solution. In a post on July 6, Sun explained that this new stablecoin would allow transfers without requiring any gas tokens, as the fees would be covered by the stablecoins themselves. However, he did not provide specific details on how this mechanism would function.\n\nSun plans to integrate this innovative solution on the Tron blockchain by the fourth quarter of this year, and will \u201clater support Ethereum and all EVM-compatible public chains.\u201d Sun believes that this gas-free stablecoin could revolutionize the way companies offer stablecoin services, significantly boosting blockchain adoption. \"I believe that similar services will greatly facilitate large companies in deploying stablecoin services on the blockchain, elevating blockchain mass adoption to a new level,\" Sun posted.\n\nCurrently, Tron leads the market in peer-to-peer stablecoin transfers, consistently processing two to three times the volume of Ethereum, according to blockchain analytics firm Artemis. Tron hosts over $50 billion of Tether's $112 billion in value issued across multiple blockchains, based on data from DefiLlama.\n\nThis new solution could position Tron as a competitor to PayPal's PYUSD, which offers certain U.S.-based users the ability to make free cross-border payments. Additionally, Circle's USD Coin (USDC) on Ethereum layer-2 Base via Coinbase Wallet also allows for free transfers, highlighting a growing trend towards cost-free stablecoin transactions."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) metrics have shown that the digital currency might be suffering from scarcity than earlier projected. According to on-chain data, Ethereum is now being accumulated at a faster rate than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ethereum and Bitcoin Divergence\n\nAccording to data insights from Leon Waidmann from BTC-Echo, Ethereum is becoming scarcer than Bitcoin. While there are metrics that show the individual performance of BTC and ETH, their correlation per exchange balances is also a crucial one.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to the accompanying Glassnode data shared by Waidmann, the current Ethereum exchange balance is pegged at 10.189%. In contrast, that of Bitcoin comes in at 15.08%, a figure that suggests a tightening gap.\n\nSince the conversation around spot Ethereum ETF came into the limelight, demand for ETH has grown. Investors suddenly started buying Ethereum at a frantic pace, accounting for the drain on trading platforms. The investor action is explainable, considering how Wall Street money is projected to buy Ethereum upon ETF launch.\n\nThis projection is not unfounded judging by the trend seen in spot Bitcoin ETF products. When the BTC ETF came into the market in January, top firms like Susquehanna International Group (SIG) went all out to buy the asset. The buyups played a crucial role in sending the price of Bitcoin to an All-Time High (ATH) of $73,750.07.\n\nDespite the exchange balance for Ethereum draining fast, the impact on the price of ETH is not visible. At the time of writing, Ethereum is changing hands for $2,983.03, down by 2.31% in the past 24 hours. The coin\u2019s 24-hour low and high trading price comes in at $2,956.99 and $3,080.11 respectively.\n\nRevival Plans for ETH\n\nThe future growth of ETH is now hinged on the new long-awaited decision from the US SEC. After it greenlighted the 19b-4 forms for the spot Ethereum ETF application weeks ago, the wait for S-1 is near.\n\nThough the timeline for launch remains largely speculative, the coming 2 weeks appear pivotal. ETF Store President Nate Geraci believes the regulator will do everything it has to do to make Ethereum ETF start trading in 2 weeks.\n\nRead More: Peter Schiff Claims Bitcoin Whales Set Up ETF Investors As \u201cBag Holders\u201d\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum briefly fell below $3,000 but has since recovered, with bullish predictions targeting prices up to $8,000.\n\nOptimism is partly driven by the potential launch of spot ETH ETFs in the US, expected by some industry participants as early as mid-July.\n\nThe Next Target\n\nThe cryptocurrency market decline witnessed at the end of last week and the start of the new one has negatively affected Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) price, which briefly tumbled below the $3,000 mark. In the past 24 hours, though, bulls stepped in, pushing the valuation above that level.\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts seem unfazed by the latest crash, predicting a strong rally for ETH in the foreseeable future. Lucky\u2014an X user with over 2 million followers\u2014described the asset\u2019s plunge below $3,000 as \u201ca natural gift.\u201d However, he cautioned investors to keep an eye on the sector in the next few days before making \u201cany big moves.\u201d\n\nMikybull Crypto believes ETH\u2019s price has \u201cfully completed its retest on the bull pattern breakout,\u201d expecting an uptick to as high as $4,000.\n\nMcKenna and Poseidon were even more bullish. The former set a target of $5,000, while the latter forecasted a new peak of as high as $8,000 to be reached sometime next year.\n\nOne major factor that could trigger an upward momentum is the eventual official launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States. Recall that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eight such products but they are not live yet. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Balchunas, July 18 seems like the \u201cbest guess\u201d for a launch date.\n\nPrevious Predictions\n\nThe X users Captain Faibik and Crypto Tony were among those touching upon ETH\u2019s price trajectory during the market correction. The former recommended buying the dip, forecasting that the asset will \u201cbounce back.\u201d\n\nCrypto Tony suggested that everything would be under control as long as bulls held the important resistance level of $3,270. However, ETH dipped well below that mark, currently trading at less than $3,100 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data)."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell below $56,552 on Sunday, breaking the market structure and prompting a bearish outlook.\n\nEthereum revisits the $2,817 support level, a close below it would indicate a bearish move.\n\nRipple price finds support around the weekly support level of $0.413, breaking below signals a bearish move.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) dropped below $56,552 on Sunday, disrupting market structure and signaling a bearish outlook. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) also revisited their support levels, slipping below critical thresholds, indicating a possible downtrend for these assets in the days ahead.\n\nBitcoin price shows potential for a downward move\n\nBitcoin's price encountered resistance at the weekly resistance level of $58,375 on Saturday, resulting in a 4% decline the next day. By Sunday's close, it had fallen below the low of $56,552 from May 1 and traded around $54,900, 1.65% down on Monday.\n\nIf BTC's weekly support at $58,375 acts as a resistance, it could decline 5% to revisit its daily support at $52,266.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart support this bearish thesis, as both indicators are below their respective neutral levels of 50 and zero. This suggests continued momentum favoring bears, potentially leading to a further decline in the Bitcoin price.\n\nAdditionally, if the bears are aggressive and the overall crypto market outlook is negative, BTC could extend an additional decline of 3.3% to retest its February 23 low of $50,521.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC closes above the $58,375 weekly resistance level and forms a higher high in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bullish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 9.7% rise in Bitcoin's price to revisit its next daily resistance at $63,956.\n\nEthereum price is poised to decline shortly\n\nEthereum's price retested the May 1 low of $2,817 on Friday, bouncing 3.35% on Saturday.\n\nHowever, this Sunday, it fell 4.5%, and at the time of writing, it is again revisiting that low.\n\nIf ETH's price closes below its May 1 low of $2,817, it could decline 6.5% to revisit its daily support at $2,621.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart support this bearish thesis, as both indicators are below their respective neutral levels of 50 and zero. This suggests continued momentum favoring bears, potentially leading to a further decline in the Ethereum price.\n\nHowever, if ETH's price closes below $2,621, it could extend an additional decline of 9.5% to retest its next daily support at $2,376.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick price closes above $3,524, forming a higher high in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bullish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 5.6% rise in Ethereum's price to revisit its high of June 9 at $3,717.\n\nRipple price outlook suggests a downward trajectory\n\nRipple price finds support around the weekly level of $0.413.At the time of writing, it trades 1% down at $0.414.\n\nIf XRP\u2019s daily closes below $0.413, it could crash 15% to revisit its March 12, 2023 low of $0.347.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) on the daily chart support this bearish thesis, as both indicators are below their respective neutral levels of 50 and zero. This suggests continued momentum favoring bears, potentially leading to a further decline in the Ripple price.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nConversely, if the Ripple price daily candlestick closes above $0.499 and forms a higher high in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bullish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 6% rise in Ripple's price to revisit its high of June 5 at $0.532."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs were gaining much popularity in the United States.\n\nETH was down by 12% last week, but a few market indicators hinted at a trend reversal.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been facing multiple price corrections over the past month. This happened at a time when its much-awaited ETH ETFs launch was drawing in.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s going on with ETH to find out whether its launch would benefit the king of altcoins and allow it to outshine Bitcoin [BTC] in the coming days.\n\nEthereum ETF hype isn\u2019t enough?\n\nInvestors and the crypto market as a whole have been waiting patiently for the launch of ETH ETFs. As per the latest data, the possible launch of Ethereum ETFs can be expected on the 15th of July.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Google Trends\u2019 data showed that the popularity of Ethereum ETFs has been consistent throughout the last 30 days in the United States, reflecting the hype around them.\n\nAlthough the launch date was getting closer and the market seemed excited, Ethereum continued to struggle to raise its price.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 125 in the last seven days. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $3,045.32 with a market capitalization of over $366 million.\n\nA possible reason behind this bearish price movement could be the lack of confidence in ETH among investors.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s Weighted Sentiment moved southward substantially last week. This clearly meant that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum ETF\n\nSince ETH remained bearish despite the launch getting closer, AMBCrypto planned to compare both Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s states ahead of their ETF launches.\n\nOur analysis revealed that BTC\u2019s price started to gain bullish momentum way before its ETF launch date.\n\nTo be precise, BTC\u2019s price started to move in November 2023 and peaked during the BTC ETF launch on January 10, 2024. However, soon after the launch, BTC\u2019s price started to decline.\n\nOn this front, Bitcoin was clearly dominating Ethereum. However, to see whether ETH was planning something bullish a week ahead of the ETF launch, we then analyzed ETH\u2019s daily chart.\n\nWe found that Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick after touching the oversold zone.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAdditionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed a similar increasing trend. This indicated that ETH might turn bullish in the coming days.\n\nNonetheless, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved southward. The MACD also displayed a bearish advantage in the market."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nPolygon (MATIC) has just registered a significant new milestone, especially in relation to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to a simple performance stat shared on X by Polygon cofounder Mihailo Bjelic, the total number of active addresses on the layer-2 network is more than that of Bitcoin and Ethereum combined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolygon picking small wins\n\nWhile it represents a unique asset class, Polygon remains one of the top digital currencies to watch out for. Amid the price drawdown recorded over the past week, Polygon has seen its total active users jump by 1.18 million in 24 hours. In comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s active users within the same period came in at approximately 594,000, while those of Ethereum are pegged at 365,000.\n\nNumber of active addresses (24h):\n\n\n\nPolygon: 1.18M\n\nBitcoin: 594k\n\nEthereum: 365k\n\n\n\nNot too shabby, I guess.. \u2014 Mihailo Bjelic (@MihailoBjelic) July 8, 2024\n\nThese active users underscore many different positive metrics for their respective crypto networks. For Polygon, being a smaller protocol in market capitalization does not undermine its recognition as a well-used chain.\n\nWith the Polygon network running smoothly despite its massive on-chain transactions or activity, it shows that the efforts of the Polygon team to scale the protocol are not wasted. This validation is especially needed for Polygon, whose address profitability has been slumping in recent times.\n\nPolygon revival bid\n\nPer data from IntoTheBlock, exactly 90.62% of all Polygon addresses are in losses at the time of writing. In actual figure terms, this amounts to 627,350 addresses.\n\nDrawing on this, MATIC holders are in dire need of recovery, and every positive ecosystem fundamental adds up to the trigger needed. Already, MATIC is responding to some of these key fundamentals as its price has returned to a bullish setting.\n\nAt the time of writing, the coin is up 4.63% in the past 24 hours and is changing hands for $0.5046 per data from CoinMarketCap. After falling by more than 9% in the past seven days, this recovery proves a brighter week might yet be ahead."

        "content": "As we head into the second week of July, all eyes are on the S-1 submissions for the spot Ethereum ETFs, expected to go live by July 15. In the last week of June, the US SEC had returned all the S-1 forms to the issuers asking them to resubmit with some minor changes. ETF Store President Nate Geraci says that the amendments to the S-1 filings shall likely arrive by Monday, July 8.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Amendments\n\nGeraci stated that the bigger thing to watch is how quickly will the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) process these amendments. The ETF Store President stated that the primary focus will be on the fees associated with these ETFs. some market players like Bitwise have already submitted their S-1 amendments last week. Other issuers like BlackRock, 21Shares, Fidelity, and Grayscale are like to submit by Monday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSpot eth ETF S-1 amendments supposedly due tomorrow\u2026 How quickly will SEC turn these around? Again, main item I\u2019m watching for is fees (which won\u2019t be required w/ these amendments). Otherwise, assume issuers gearing up for launch in next week or two. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 7, 2024\n\nHe further added that issuers are preparing for a potential launch in the next two weeks subject to the SEC approval.

In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum price has tanked by an additional 5.6% slipping all the way to $2,871 with its market cap falling under $350 billion.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the approval of the spot Ether ETFs triggers some upside movement or if the bears continue to dominate.\n\nAlso Read: Will ETH Outperform BTC as ETF Launch Nears in July?\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "In a remarkable shift, Solana has overtaken Ethereum, attracting significant investment amid a $441 million inflow into the crypto market. With Solana pulling in over $16 million compared to Ethereum\u2019s $10 million, the dynamics of digital asset investments are seeing notable changes.\n\nNotably, this development signals a growing interest in alternative cryptocurrencies as investors seek new opportunities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana Outshines With Robust Weekly Inflow\n\nSolana\u2019s recent performance has caught the attention of investors, as highlighted in a report by CoinShares. Digital asset investment products saw substantial inflows totaling $441 million, with recent price dips viewed as buying opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, the inflows were primarily driven by the U.S., contributing $384 million, while other significant contributions came from Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Canada. According to the report, Bitcoin led the inflows with $398 million, but for the first time, it accounted for just 90% of the total, indicating a broader interest in top altcoins.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana emerged as the standout altcoin, attracting $16 million last week and bringing its year-to-date inflows to $57 million. This makes Solana the top-performing altcoin in terms of investment flows, surpassing Ethereum, which saw $10 million in inflows but has experienced net outflows year-to-date.\n\nHowever, blockchain equities did not share this positive sentiment, facing an additional $8 million in outflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $556 million. The report suggests that recent selling pressures from the German government\u2019s Bitcoin dump have impacted the market, but savvy investors are leveraging these events as opportunities to invest in digital assets.\n\nBesides, looming concerns over Mt. Gox repayments have also weighed on the broader crypto market sentiment lately.\n\nAlso Read: Matrixport Reveals Ethereum ETF Launch Timeline, Bernstein Targets ETH To $6,600\n\nPotential Reasons Behind The Robust Performance\n\nThe question remains: why is Solana outperforming Ethereum? Several factors contribute to this trend. One significant reason appears to be the ongoing discussions about a potential Solana ETF in the US.\n\nVanEck was the first U.S. firm to file for a Solana ETF with the SEC, which may have fueled optimism among investors, driving robust inflows into the asset.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s performance in the broader altcoin market has been notable. As investors diversify their portfolios beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana\u2019s technological advancements and growing ecosystem have made it an attractive option.\n\nThe network\u2019s scalability, lower transaction costs, and rapid transaction speeds position it as a strong competitor in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Moreover, regional investment patterns highlight a global interest in Solana.\n\nWhile the U.S. remains a dominant player, substantial investments from Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Canada underscore Solana\u2019s appeal across different markets. This diverse investment base further strengthens its position as a leading altcoin.\n\nOn the other hand, the SEC delaying the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF approval might have forced some investors to shift their focus toward other low-priced altcoins.\n\nAlso Read: Binance To Delist All Spot Pairs Of These Major Crypto\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "title": "Matrixport Reveals Ethereum ETF Launch Timeline, Bernstein Targets ETH To $6,600 - CoinGape",
        "content": "With all eyes on a spot Ethereum ETF approval for listing and trading by the U.S. SEC, experts predict high odds of approval this month. Crypto financial services firm Matrixport believes the Securities and Exchange Commission might approve Ether ETF by this week as the deadline for issuers to submit amended S-1 filings is Monday.\n\nEthereum ETF Approval Likely This Week\n\nIn a new update on July 8, Matrixport reported that the SEC will likely approve Ether ETF this week. The United States will have an exchange-traded fund tracking the spot price of Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMatrixport expects swift progress similar to May when the SEC suddenly asked spot Ethereum ETF issuers to revise their applications. After 19b-4 filings by issuers, the SEC instantly approved them in the next three days. The S-1 applications were probably delayed due to the July 4 holiday and the long weekend.\n\nCoinGape reported that the SEC delayed Ethereum ETF launch with a few comments, pushing the S-1 deadline to July 8. ETFstore President Nate Geraci said the last round of S-1 revisions was quite \u201clight\u201d and believes Ethereum ETFs will start trading in the next two weeks.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Hashdex, VanEck, and Invesco are anticipated to submit S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: EtherFi Foundation Buys ETHFI, Passes Major Staking Proposal On Ethereum Mainnet\n\nETH Price To Witness Massive Rally?\n\nMatrixport predicts a recovery in Ethereum price to $3,400 after the approval by SEC. The company forecasting a nearly 12% sharp jump based on analysis that ETH price rallied 20% after the SEC approved 19-b filings.\n\nWhereas, $725 billion asset manager Bernstein earlier gave a long-term ETH price target of $6,600. The firm reported that ETH will reach this price after spot Ethereum ETFs approval by the SEC. Notably, the estimate is based on a 75% rally in Bitcoin products in January following weeks of ETFs approval. Bernstein analysts expect a similar price action for Ethereum.\n\nETH price rose 2% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $3,068. The 24-hour low and high are $2,826 and $3,090, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased further by 57% in the last 24 hours, indicating a rise in interest among traders.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Whale Moves 37M Tokens As Lawyer Reveals Ripple Vs SEC Timeline\n\nVarinder Singh Varinder has 10 years of experience in the Fintech sector, with over 5 years dedicated to blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developments.

        "title": "Zero fee for stablecoin on Tron and Ethereum? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "On Saturday, the founder of the crypto project Tron, Justin Sun, stated that they are working on a solution to eliminate the fees on stablecoins, possibly even on the Ethereum network.\n\nOur team is developing a new solution that enables gas-free stablecoin transfers. In other words, transfers can be made without paying any gas tokens, with the fees being entirely covered by the stablecoins themselves. \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) July 6, 2024\n\nIt would be a new solution that allows stablecoin transfers without gas, so that transfers can be made without paying fees, which would be entirely covered by the stablecoin themselves.\n\nAccording to Sun, this solution will be implemented first on the Tron blockchain, but will subsequently also support Ethereum and all public chains compatible with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and will greatly facilitate large companies that want to implement services based on stablecoin, thus bringing the mass adoption of blockchain to a new level.\n\nThe solution: zero fee for stablecoin exchanges on Ethereum and Tron\n\nThe details of this solution have not yet been disclosed, except for the fact that the Tron development team plans to launch this service in the fourth quarter of the current year.\n\nWhat is known is that it is a solution that will be applied to on-chain P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions, that is, those without intermediaries, and that it will require the fees to be paid neither by the sender nor the receiver.\n\nIt is therefore not an abolition of the fees, also because the block validators must still have an incentive to continue working on validation, but a change regarding who pays them.\n\nSince it is a solution specifically designed for stablecoin, it is possible that it also directly involves the issuers of the stablecoin, even though for example Tether has not said anything about it so far.\n\nTron and USDT\n\nTron is now by far the most used chain in the world for transactions of the main stablecoin, USDT by Tether.\n\nAccording to the data from Artemis, it dominates not only in terms of the number of transactions but also in volumes.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 P2P Transfers\n\n\n\nTRON leads in P2P transfers.\n\n\n\nWe classify P2P transfers as transfers going from an EOA to EOA\n\n\n\nTRON consistently has 2-3x as much P2P transfer volume as Ethereum, indicating TRON is facilitating more payments and money transfers, compared to DeFi activity. pic.twitter.com/48n60qLRO2 \u2014 Artemis (@artemis__xyz) June 27, 2024\n\nIn particular, starting from the beginning of 2023, it has surpassed Ethereum and has not been reached again.\n\nIt is an average daily volume that in recent months has exceeded 10 billion dollars, with peaks even over 15.\n\nHowever, regarding transactions in USDT on Ethereum, the average daily volume often remains below 8 billion, although with peaks at almost 10, while in 2022 it had also abundantly surpassed this last threshold.\n\nThe chart clearly shows how starting from 2023 the trading volumes of USDT on Ethereum have decreased just as those on Tron were increasing.\n\nThe reason is quickly explained: in the face of an average transaction fee of about $0.175 on Tron, on Ethereum it rises above $1.3, which is almost ten times as much.\n\nThe competitors\n\nNote that on Solana and TON the average fee drops even below $0.05.\n\nIn particular, transactions on TON are experiencing strong growth, especially since Telegram is heavily promoting the use of \u201cits\u201d blockchain.\n\nIt is possible that the idea of the Tron team to develop an even more economical solution, in terms of fees, has only recently emerged precisely thanks to the competition from TON and Solana.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the largest use of Tron today is USDT transactions, so if these were to move to other chains, Tron would lose many users and a lot of traffic.\n\nGiven that Solana and TON allow transactions with much lower fees, a drastic solution was needed to keep Tron competitive. Also, the main reason for using Tron instead of Ethereum is precisely the much lower fees. Therefore, from this point of view, Solana and TON seriously risk becoming strong competitors of Tron if the fees on Tron remain at current levels.\n\nTether and the news of zero fees on stablecoins on Ethereum and Tron\n\nAlthough Tether has not yet made anything official regarding this initiative by Tron, its CEO Paolo Ardoino wrote on Saturday that changes are coming.\n\nHe was referring to the use of USDT for making payments, and in particular to a solution developed by the Celo development team.\n\nUSDT in fact is not present only on Tron, Ethereum, Solana, and TON, but also on Omni (a sidechain of Bitcoin) and on other chains, including Avalanche, Near, Cosmos, Tezos, and others, including Celo.\n\nThe solution developed by Celo allows for payments in cryptocurrency (USDT) using a card.\n\nCrypto Payments Going Mainstream\u2728\n\nYou can seamlessly pay with USDT on Celo using Ammer Pay. It's as simple as tapping your card\ud83d\udcb3\n\n\n\nExperience the future of payments today with @Celo @Tether_to @AmmerWallet\n\n\n\nP.S. Want to learn how to add USDT on Celo to your Ammer Wallet? Check\u2026 pic.twitter.com/c1MZ4SRnmy \u2014 Ammer Cards (@AmmerCards) July 5, 2024\n\nThis should allow payments in USDT practically anywhere payment cards like Visa and Mastercard are accepted.\n\nThe future\n\nCombining the two things, one can imagine that in a not too distant future it will be possible to make transfers of USDT and other stablecoins from one wallet to another without paying fees, or paying very low fees, and then use those same stablecoins to make payments anywhere with classic credit or debit cards.\n\nThe fact is that all these operations can be managed easily and in a very fast and efficient way by new IT platforms specifically designed and created to minimize waste and friction, thus reducing costs and execution times to the maximum.\n\nTraditional payment systems in fiat currency have never managed to achieve as much, also because they are based on a monetary system that has never been truly optimized in recent decades.\n\nCryptocurrencies are natively digital tokens, already designed to be easily exchangeable by anyone, and stablecoins also solve the last obstacle to their mass adoption, namely the excessive volatility of their purchasing power."

Additionally, it is just one candle away from bullishness as it is lagging slightly behind 200 EMA.\n\nEthereum bullish double bottom breakout\n\nAccording to expert technical analysis, ETH was looking bullish as it formed a double-bottom price action pattern in a 4-hour time frame and at a neckline near the $3,085 level.\n\nIf it gives a breakout and 4-hour candle closing above the neckline, there is a high possibility for ETH to hit the $3,250 and $3,300 levels.\n\nFurthermore, this bullishness in the Ether chart is also getting support from the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is in the oversold area and signals a potential recovery.\n\nDespite this bullish double-bottom pattern, ETH has been consolidating within a tight range between the $2,850 and $3,080 levels for the last five days.\n\nHowever, this consolidation is taking place at an important support level, and a breakout or breakdown from this consolidation zone may cause a significant price momentum in either direction.\n\nEther\u2019s strong support level and liquidation area\n\nHowever, ETH has reached this level more than four times since April 2024.

        "content": "Solana beat Ethereum in the memecoin sector.\n\nOverall activity on the Solana network surged over the last quarter.\n\nSolana [SOL] was one of the few cryptocurrency networks that witnessed tremendous growth over the last year. One of the reasons for the surge in Solana\u2019s growth was the emergence of memecoins.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum\n\nA recent report by CoinMarketCap highlights a significant trend in the cryptocurrency market for the first half of 2024.\n\nSolana-based memecoins have experienced exceptional growth, outperforming their Ethereum counterparts by an average of nearly 800% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nThis surge extends beyond memecoins, as the Solana ecosystem itself has garnered increased investor attention compared to Ethereum during this period.\n\nWhile this heightened interest may not directly translate to a corresponding increase in network activity, it signifies a noteworthy shift in investor sentiment.\n\nSince October 2023, both the native token SOL and the broader ecosystem, including its memecoin projects, have witnessed a remarkable uptick in both price performance and public interest.\n\nThis momentum has propelled Solana into the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape, solidifying its position as a competitor of increasing prominence.\n\nAlthough Ethereum currently maintains its dominant position, Solana\u2019s impressive growth cannot be overlooked and suggests a potential future challenge to the established leader.\n\nActivity on Solana soared in Q4\n\nSolana\u2019s network activity experienced a significant surge in the second quarter of 2024. Transaction fees and revenue grew exponentially, exceeding $26 million, a remarkable 42x increase year-over-year.\n\nThis growth reflects a booming ecosystem, further evidenced by the total SOL trading volume reaching a staggering $292 billion, nearly seven times higher than the same period in 2023.\n\nDelving deeper into the network metrics, Q2 2024 saw over 15.3 billion transactions completed, encompassing both voting and non-voting activities. This represents a substantial increase in overall network utilization.\n\nAdditionally, the total value locked (TVL) within SOL\u2019s DeFi protocols skyrocketed to $3.4 billion, reflecting a tenfold year-over-year growth. This surge indicates the growing popularity of Solana for decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe NFT sector on Solana also witnessed explosive expansion. Over 98 million new NFTs were minted in Q2 2024, a staggering 54x increase compared to the previous year.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThis suggests a thriving and dynamic NFT ecosystem within the network.\n\nNotably, USDC, reached a market cap of $2.15 billion on Solana, constituting approximately 70% of the total stablecoin market cap on the platform."

        "content": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has experienced a significant boost, surging over 12% following a major announcement by Upbit, South Korea\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The news of ENS being added to Upbit\u2019s Korean won trading market has sparked considerable interest in the token.\n\nENS, operating as a decentralized naming system on the Ethereum blockchain, has been making notable progress in simplifying blockchain interactions for users. The system\u2019s key feature allows users to purchase easily readable names such as \u201cbob.eth\u201d and link them to various blockchain identifiers including addresses, content hashes, and metadata.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDetails of the Upbit Listing and Trading Restrictions\n\nUpbit\u2019s decision to list the ENS token on its Korean Won (KRW) market is set for July 9, 2024, with the listing going live at 18:30 KST. This move is anticipated to significantly enhance the token\u2019s liquidity and make it more accessible to South Korean investors, potentially expanding ENS\u2019s user base in the Asian cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe exchange has outlined several transaction restrictions for the new listing. Buy orders will be restricted for about 5 minutes after the listing goes live, while sell orders priced below 10% of the previous day\u2019s closing price will face similar restrictions. Market price and pre-order options will be limited for approximately an hour post-listing. Upbit has set the previous day\u2019s closing price for ENS at 0.00047124 BTC, which equates to 37,951 KRW.\n\nUpbit has also implemented strict deposit and withdrawal guidelines for ENS. These include supporting deposits and withdrawals only on the Ethereum network, implementing the \u201ctravel rule\u201d for additional review of deposits from non-listed virtual asset operators, requiring mandatory \u201cownership verification\u201d for personal wallet addresses, and potentially requesting explanations for the source of funds for large deposits from unknown sources.\n\nAlso Read: Invesco Galaxy Misses Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 Deadline, Will Approval Be Delayed?\n\nENS Market Performance and Protocol Expansion\n\nRecent market data shows the ENS token trading at $28.73, marking a significant 12.27% increase over the past 24 hours. The token has seen a substantial trading volume of $427.7 Million during this period, indicating strong market activity and interest. With a circulating supply of 32 million tokens, ENS currently holds a market capitalization of $849.7 Million.\n\nThis increased attention asides the listing announcement could be attributed to the rising adoption of ENS domains, as more users seek simplified and memorable addresses for their crypto wallets and decentralized websites. ENS has expanded its capabilities beyond its initial \u2018.eth\u2019 domains, now supporting integrated use of traditional DNS names like .com, .org, and .io. This expansion has significantly broadened the protocol\u2019s appeal and utility within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the ENS token plays a crucial role in the protocol\u2019s governance, granting holders voting rights on decisions affecting the Ethereum Name Service ecosystem. This decentralized governance model aligns with the broader principles of blockchain technology, potentially contributing to its growing popularity and value in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflow At 3-Week High, Institutions Buying Heavily Ahead Key Events\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

In 24 hours, traders exchanged USDT for over 55 billion dollars, almost double BTC and more than three times ETH.\n\nTether: daily trading volumes exceed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum combined\n\nAccording to reports, it seems that Tether is dominating the daily trading volume scene across the entire crypto market.\n\n#ICYMI: Tether 24 hour trading volume surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC and Ethereum combined\n\n\n\nRead the full article \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/rgvjPLCboo pic.twitter.com/1TQvGjuNfx \u2014 CryptoSlate (@CryptoSlate) July 8, 2024\n\n\u201cICYMI: the trading volume of Tether in the last 24 hours surpasses Bitcoin, Solana, USDC, and Ethereum combined. Read the full article\u201d\n\nIn fact, in 24 hours, USDT was traded by traders for over 55 billion dollars, doubling the 28 billion dollars of BTC and tripling the 15 billion dollars of ETH.\n\nNot only that, doing some calculations, Tether maintains a volume higher than the combined volume of Bitcoin, Ethereum, in addition to USD Coin, Solana and First Digital USD, highlighting its significant presence in the market.\n\nThis is possible because USDT remains the most used (and most favored) stablecoin in trading pairs, capable of providing coverage from the typical volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTether and daily trading volumes beyond those combined of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other assets\n\nIn general, the daily trading volumes of Tether have remained robust throughout 2024, remaining above 25 billion dollars. This allows Tether to strengthen its position as a key liquidity provider in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nNot only that, on March 16, 2024, Tether recorded the highest peak of daily trading volumes of 130 billion dollars.\n\nUSDT is also the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap. At the time of writing, in fact, Tether records a total market capitalization of over 112 billion dollars.\n\nIn addition to winning over crypto traders, Tether is also succeeding in its mission to extend the adoption of USDT to other sectors as well.\n\nIn fact, recently, Tether has entered the Philippines, where it will be possible to use USDT for payments to the Social Security System (SSS), managed by the State. This public service manages social security and employee compensation, and its payment is mandatory by law.\n\nClosing cycles to open new ones\n\nOther recent news also talks about Tether strategies that on one hand close roads that are no longer viable, but on the other hand open new ones.\n\nIn fact, the issuer of the largest stablecoin has announced the end of the minting of USDT on the EOS and Algorand platforms. Specifically, the minting of USDT on the two blockchains ended in late June, but the company has reassured users that the transition will be carried out meticulously and with minimal disruptions.\n\nThus, while on one hand Tether is closing a circle that began some time ago, on the other hand it assures users that it will decide to allocate resources where they can improve and innovate in the crypto sector.\n\nJust the week before, meanwhile, Tether had already announced an important piece of news regarding the launch of a new stablecoin collateralized in gold. It is called Alloy by Tether (aUSDT) and it is pegged to the US dollar but, instead of being collateralized in dollars, it will be collateralized in gold.\n\naUSDT is not even a stablecoin in the style of Tether Gold (XAUT), as the latter is a simple stablecoin pegged to the value of gold.\n\nTherefore, aUSDT is pegged to the dollar and technically over-collateralized in gold, meaning the total market value of all gold reserves held by Tether as collateral for aUSDT exceeds the market of all issued aUSDT tokens."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing with activity, especially as Ethereum (ETH) maintains a solid support level at $3000. While ETH continues to hold strong, investors and crypto whales are now shifting their focus to a new player in the market: Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising cryptocurrency priced at a mere $0.00077. This shift in attention could signal the beginning of a significant rally for Mpeppe (MPEPE), capturing the interest of both seasoned and new investors.\n\nThe Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become a favorite among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, thanks to its unique approach and strategic positioning. Unlike many other tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) leverages the popularity of sports fandom and blockchain technology, creating a vibrant community around sports-related activities and meme culture. This innovative blend has resonated well with investors who are always on the lookout for the next big thing.\n\nInspired by the legendary Pepecoin and the talents of professional soccer player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a distinctive value proposition. Its maximum supply of 7.6 billion tokens and an initial price of $0.00077 make it accessible to a broad range of investors, promising significant returns as the token gains traction in the market.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Stability and Whale Movement\n\nEthereum (ETH) has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, known for its robust blockchain technology and widespread adoption. Holding the $3000 support level is a testament to ETH\u2019s resilience and investor confidence. However, the stability of Ethereum (ETH) has also led investors to explore new opportunities for higher returns, particularly in emerging cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE).\n\nWhales, or large-scale investors, play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market. Their investment decisions can significantly impact the price and perception of a token. When ETH whales begin to diversify their portfolios by investing in new cryptocurrencies, it often signals strong potential for growth in those assets.

As more whales enter the market, the token\u2019s price could experience less volatility, making it an attractive option for other investors. Additionally, whale support can boost the credibility of Mpeppe (MPEPE), attracting more attention and fostering a strong community of supporters.\n\nStrategic Tokenomics of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nThe tokenomics of Mpeppe (MPEPE) are meticulously designed to ensure growth and stability. With 50% of the tokens allocated for presale, 20% for liquidity, 15% for games and sports betting, and smaller percentages for the Mbapp\u00e9 treasury and Mpeppe agents, the distribution is strategically planned to balance market stability and community engagement. This careful planning creates a strong foundation for the token, ensuring it can sustain long-term growth.\n\nThe Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market evolves, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a promising new player poised for substantial growth.

        "content": "Major financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock have updated their Spot Ethereum ETF filings in compliance with the SEC July 8 deadline.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price remains stable above US$3,000 following positive regulatory developments and expectations of ETF approvals.\n\nFuture ETF prospects for altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and XRP depend on upcoming political and regulatory changes.\n\nThe Spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) saga goes into the next round.

Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there shouldn\u2019t be too much back-and-forth from now on \u2013 with trading to start soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will give guidance back to issuers soon along with the game plan. Then the docs will come back with fees (and every other blank) filled [in] and then it\u2019s go-time.

The current price is a solid 6.4% increase from yesterday.\n\nEthereum (ETH), 1-day graph, source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe price of ETH seems tied to any news around these funds, with many observers firmly expecting a launch without further delays. The odds of the funds being approved increased dramatically last month when the SEC dropped an investigation about ETH\u2019s status as a security.\n\nPresident of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, said he would be shocked if these funds are not trading within the next two weeks, eyeing July 15 for the first trading day.\n\nWill be *shocked* if spot eth ETFs not trading w/in next 2 weeks\u2026\n\n\n\nLater next week a possibility, but think week of July 15th more likely.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, price of eth \u2193 20%+ since \"surprise\" 19b-4 approvals in late May. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 6, 2024\n\nOther Altcoin ETFs Next? Chances of Solana, Cardano and XRP\n\nWith the Ethereum ETFs done and dusted \u2013 going by the experts at least \u2013 the next likely candidates for a fund are probably Solana, Cardano and XRP. VanEck and 21Shares have applied for a US listing of these funds and there has been talk around Cardano and XRP to also get a listing.\n\nHowever, many observers are highly doubtful if any of this is happening in the near future. If President Joe Biden remains in office \u2013 which is still out in the open given his recent shaky public appearances \u2013 some believe any such request for a fund for SOL, XRP or ADA will be shot down.\n\nRelated: Defying Market Fears, Notcoin and Celestia Rally, with TIA Gaining 27%\n\nOthers are hopeful that if elected, self-proclaimed crypto-president Donald Trump could fix the broken relationship between the US-crypto sector and the US Government.

        "content": "Ether.Fi Foundation on Monday announced that it has purchased ETHFI worth 46 ETH as part of a proposal passed earlier by the community. In addition, the EtherFi liquid restaking platform team will also start working on deploying a staking contract for ETHFI on Ethereum mainnet, bolstering utility by linking rewards to governance participation and effective balances in the ecosystem.\n\nEther.Fi Foundation Declares ETHFI Tokens Purchase\n\nEther.Fi Foundation took to X platform on July 8 to reveal that it has purchased ETHFI tokens worth 46 ETH. The purchase came in response to a proposal passed by the community on ETHFI buyback and liquidity pool seeding. ETHFI purchased by the foundation was deposited into a weETH/ETHFI curve pool. This amount accounts for 5% of the protocol revenue in June.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs per the proposal, EtherFi Foundation will purchase ETHFI with up to 50% of protocol revenue, with the initial 5% initiated by the foundation. Notably, the further purchases of monthly revenue will be put to a community vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the community also passed ETHFI DAO proposal for staking contract implementation on Ethereum mainnet. It aims to provide utility by linking rewards to governance participation and balances in the ecosystem. The ETHFI staking contract will also offer incentives and voting capabilities to staked token holders.\n\n\u201cBy allowing users to stake ETHFI tokens, we create an additional layer of engagement within the ecosystem. This encourages token holders to actively participate rather than passively holding their tokens.\u201d\n\nThe proposal received 99.5% votes in favor, indicating massive support for deploying a staking contract for ETHFI on Ethereum mainnet.

However, it has since bounced back and is now trading at $57,000. The next resistance levels are at $57,600 and $58,200. Meanwhile, Ethereum has traded above $3,000 and is aiming for $3,110, which could indicate the beginning of a rally towards $3,270.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cWith Bitcoin trading below the critical resistance level at 58.4k USD, bears are looking to strengthen their grip even as the German government has already sold more than 50% of its originally held 50,000 BTC as per the data from Arkham Intelligence. ETH as well is just able to sustain above 3000 dollars even as the ETF trading of the world\u2019s largest crypto is coming close.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin is consolidating losses above $55,000 after attempting a recovery above $56,500 and $57,500. It failed to break past $58,200, forming a high at $58,129 before declining and hitting a low of $54,954. It\u2019s now consolidating, with minor gains above the 50% Fib retracement level from $58,129 to $54,954. Bitcoin remains below $57,500 and the 100-hour SMA, with immediate resistance near $57,250.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe crypto market witnessed a highly volatile Monday after German government transferred over $900 million worth of assets from its bitcoin holdings as per the blockchain data. The transfer was made to crypto exchanges and a total of 8700 BTC was moved which resulted in a 3% drop in BTC prices on Monday afternoon. However, Bitcoin rebounded to $57,200 level but this support level looks very weak. The increased supply of BTC in the market is good news as more BTCs are available on exchanges to buying and trading activities. Ethereum on the other hand recovered by over 5% and is changing hands at $3070 level.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cGermany continues to have a significant influence on the cryptocurrency market, holding 39,826 BTC worth $2.2 billion, which is about 9% of the $25.3 billion daily bitcoin trading volume. The stash, obtained from movie piracy site Movie2k.to, is gradually being liquidated, impacting BTC prices. Recent sales have seen a nearly 20% drop, with the spot price reaching $55,490. There has been criticism of Germany's strategy of selling BTC for fiat currency, which is seen as potentially harmful given the scarcity of Bitcoin versus unlimited fiat printing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners are experiencing a \"capitulation,\" which may signal a market bottom, as they adjust to reduced profits amid market turmoil.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cDespite selling pressure from the German government moving BTC to exchanges, the crypto market has shown resilience with positive returns in the last 24 hours. Technically, BTC needs to reclaim $58,500 for a bullish sign, while ETH needs to stay above $2,875. ETH/BTC bounced from key support, helping some alts like TIA and ETHFI gain over 20% in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Bithumb To List Vitalik Buterin-Backed ETH Layer 2 Project & Top Meme Coin - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, has revealed plans to list BRETT and TAIKO in Korean won markets on July 9 at 18:00 local time. TAIKO is a zkEVM Ethereum layer 2 network that has received support from Vitalik Buterin. BRETT is a prominent meme coin built on the Base chain. Both cryptocurrencies have seen significant price increases following the listing announcement, reflecting investor enthusiasm.\n\nListing Details and Market Impact\n\nBithumb has officially scheduled the launch of BRETT and TAIKO trading in the Korean won market for July 9 at 18:00 local time. This announcement has generated substantial excitement and trading activity among investors, driving significant price surges for both BRETT and TAIKO.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTAIKO, a zkEVM Ethereum layer 2 network backed by Vitalik Buterin, will be listed with a base price of 2,938 won. The exchange has set the number of required deposit confirmations at 30 for TAIKO transactions. This relatively low number of confirmations suggests a balance between security and transaction speed, which could appeal to traders looking for efficient transactions.\n\nBRETT, a popular meme coin deployed on the Base chain, will enter the market with a base price of 149 won. Bithumb has set a higher bar for BRETT transactions, requiring 200 deposit confirmations. This increased number of confirmations might indicate a more cautious approach to the meme coin, possibly due to the volatile nature of such tokens.\n\nThe listing on Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the highly active South Korean market, represents a significant milestone for both BRETT and TAIKO. This move is expected to substantially boost their visibility and trading volume. The increased exposure on a major platform like Bithumb not only enhances the liquidity of these tokens but also attracts a new pool of investors, potentially contributing to their upward price momentum.\n\nFurthermore, the listing on a reputable exchange like Bithumb may be seen as a form of validation for these projects, especially for TAIKO, given its association with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. This could lead to increased confidence among investors and potentially pave the way for listings on other major exchanges in the future.\n\nAlso Read: DigitalX Gears to List Spot Bitcoin ETF on Australia\u2019s ASX Exchange As Demand Soars\n\nCurrent Market Performance and Future Outlook\n\nAs of the latest data, Brett (BRETT) is trading at $0.1239, with a 24-hour trading volume of $83.9 million and a 7.41% price increase over the past day. Its market capitalization stands at $1.2 billion, based on a circulating supply of 9.9 billion BRETT.\n\nTaiko (TAIKO) is priced at $2.28, with a 24-hour trading volume of $57.1 million and a 10.92% price increase in the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $144.6 million, with a circulating supply of 63 million TAIKO.\n\nThe substantial price movements following the Bithumb listing announcement indicate positive market reception and suggest potential for further growth. As BRETT and TAIKO continue to gain traction, their listing on a prominent exchange like Bithumb is anticipated to boost investor confidence and encourage wider market adoption.\n\nAlso Read: SOL Price Surges 6% Following Cboe Filing for Spot Solana ETF\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Ethereum price seems to be forming a base above the $2,820 level. ETH could break the $3,160 resistance and rise toward the $3,320 resistance.\n\nEthereum is consolidating losses above the $2,880 level.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,960 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above the $3,160 resistance.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes More Upsides\n\nEthereum price retested the $2,820 support zone. ETH seems to be forming a base above $2,820 and recently started a consolidation phase, like Bitcoin. There was a recovery wave above the $2,880 and $2,920 resistance levels.\n\nThere was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $2,960 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair tested the $3,080 resistance zone. A high was formed at $3,072 and the price could aim for more upsides in the near term.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is also above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,894 swing low to the $3,072 high.\n\nIf there is another recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $3,080 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,150 level. The next major hurdle is near the $3,200 level. A close above the $3,200 level might send Ether toward the $3,320 resistance.\n\nThe next key resistance is near $3,350. An upside break above the $3,350 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,500 resistance zone.\n\nAnother Decline In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $3,020. The first major support sits near the $2,960 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,894 swing low to the $3,072 high.\n\nA clear move below the $2,960 support might push the price toward $2,880. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,820 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,960\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,150"

        "title": "Ethereum: Top Reasons Ethereum Could Overtake Bitcoin BTC As New Cryptocurrencies Take Centre Stage - NewsBTC",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Ethereum (ETH) has emerged as a strong contender to potentially overtake Bitcoin (BTC). With its advanced blockchain capabilities, including smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum (ETH) offers more than just a digital currency. Among the promising tokens riding the Ethereum (ETH) wave is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new cryptocurrency that is capturing the attention of investors. Here\u2019s why Ethereum (ETH) might surpass Bitcoin (BTC) and what it means for tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE).\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) Technological Edge\n\nEthereum (ETH) stands out due to its robust technology. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum (ETH) offers a versatile platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). This flexibility has attracted a wide range of developers and businesses, driving innovation and adoption.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network supports smart contracts, which automate and enforce contractual agreements without the need for intermediaries. This feature has opened up new possibilities in various industries, from finance to supply chain management, making Ethereum (ETH) an integral part of the digital economy.\n\nThe Rise of DeFi and NFTs\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have become significant trends in the crypto world, and Ethereum (ETH) is at the forefront of both movements. DeFi platforms built on Ethereum (ETH) allow users to engage in lending, borrowing, and trading without relying on traditional financial institutions. This democratization of finance has attracted billions in investment.\n\nSimilarly, the NFT craze, which involves digital collectibles and art, is predominantly based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. The popularity of NFTs has brought Ethereum (ETH) into mainstream consciousness, further solidifying its position in the market.\n\nImplications for Ethereum (ETH) Surpassing Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nIf Ethereum (ETH) were to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) in market capitalization, it would signify a major shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. Such a milestone would validate the broader utility of Ethereum (ETH) beyond just a store of value, highlighting its role as a foundational technology for decentralized applications and financial services.\n\nThis potential shift would also boost confidence in Ethereum-based tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As more investors recognize the value and potential of the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, projects built on this platform could see increased investment and growth.\n\n\n\nThe Potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nMpeppe (MPEPE) is an innovative ERC20 token that leverages the strengths of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Inspired by the meme culture and the global popularity of football star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Mpeppe (MPEPE) aims to create a vibrant community around sports and entertainment. With a maximum supply of 7.6 billion tokens and an initial price of $0.00077, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to attract both seasoned investors and newcomers.\n\nThe strategic allocation of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens ensures market stability and community engagement, making it a promising investment. The presale of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens has already generated significant interest, particularly among Ethereum (ETH) investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Its Impact on Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) continues to innovate and expand its capabilities, tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand to benefit. The scalability and security of the Ethereum (ETH) network provide a strong foundation for Mpeppe (MPEPE), ensuring reliable transactions and robust smart contract functionality.\n\nThe potential launch of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF could further boost the network\u2019s adoption and visibility. Increased institutional investment in Ethereum (ETH) would likely spill over to ERC20 tokens, including Mpeppe (MPEPE), driving their demand and value.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum Whales\n\nEthereum whales, or large holders of Ethereum (ETH), play a significant role in the market dynamics. Their investment decisions can influence trends and drive prices. The entry of Ethereum whales into new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) can signal confidence and attract other investors.\n\nBy supporting Mpeppe (MPEPE), Ethereum whales not only diversify their holdings but also contribute to the token\u2019s growth and stability. Their involvement can provide the liquidity needed for Mpeppe (MPEPE) to thrive, making it an attractive option for smaller investors as well.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum (ETH) has the potential to overtake Bitcoin (BTC) due to its technological advantages and broader application in decentralized finance and digital assets. This shift would have positive implications for Ethereum-based tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE), driving investment and growth. As the crypto market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on developments within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem and emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) can offer valuable opportunities for investors. The smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, providing a gateway to potentially significant returns.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale:\n\nVisit Mpeppe (MPEPE)\n\nJoin and become a community member:\n\nhttps://t.me/mpeppecoin\n\nhttps://x.com/mpeppecommunity?s=11&t=hQv3guBuxfglZI-0YOTGuQ\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "content": "Since 2014, the Ethereum ecosystem has been at the forefront of sponsoring and pioneering countless projects and innovations through its nonprofit arm, the Ethereum Foundation. Among these, Golem stands out as an early ICO-era stalwart. Recently, Golem made headlines by transferring over $100 million worth of ether (ETH) to exchanges in just one month. This has triggered speculation \u2014 as expected \u2014 within the crypto hub about Golem\u2019s ultimate plans and the potential impact on the price of its native token, Golem Network Token (GRN).\n\nIndependent journalist Colin Wu first reported on Golem\u2019s wallet movements, sparking curiosity among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nGolem, a project that raised 820,000 ETH in ICO in 2016, has transferred 36,000 ETH to Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex, etc. in the past 37 days, worth about $115 million. Currently, Golem still has 231,400 ETH, worth about $656 million. https://t.co/EjLTyeEAmz \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 8, 2024\n\nGolem\u2019s ICO Days\n\nGolem emerged during the ICO bout of 2016, raising an impressive $8.7 million worth of ETH in a mere 29 minutes. Its vision was ambitious: to create a decentralized marketplace for computing power. Users could rent out their unused computational resources in exchange for Golem\u2019s native token, GLM. However, despite its promising start, Golem\u2019s journey has been marked by both highs and lows.\n\nGolem\u2019s main wallet has been on the move, transferring millions of ETH to other wallets, which were subsequently sent to major exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase, Arkham Intel data reveals.\n\nThese transactions, mostly below $10 million in value, occur daily.\n\nImage via: Golem ether transfers (Arkham)\n\nMarket Speculations and Selling Pressure\n\nThe $100 million ether transfer raises questions about Golem\u2019s intentions. When tokens move to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell holdings. Large amounts of tokens are rarely held on exchanges for extended periods due to security concerns resulting from past bridges on established CEXs. Speculatively, as Golem\u2019s ETH floods the market, it potentially adds selling pressure, affecting prices and investor sentiment.\n\nDespite its initial success, Golem\u2019s token value has dwindled significantly. Currently trading at around 30 cents with a market cap of $300 million, it\u2019s a far cry from its all-time high of $1.32 in the good old days of January 2018. However, Golem remains committed to development efforts, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Their roadmap spotlight released in May highlights their focus on AI-based solutions.\n\n24h Trading Data of GLM. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nLearning from the ICO Era\n\nGolem\u2019s story reflects broader trends in the crypto space. ICOs, once a popular fundraising method, lost their charm due to regulatory challenges and waning investor interest. Statista report shows that billions were raised between 2016 and 2019, but subsequent years saw a decline. Golem\u2019s journey serves as a cautionary tale for projects seeking sustained success beyond the initial hype."
