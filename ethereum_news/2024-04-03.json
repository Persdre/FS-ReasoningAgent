        "content": "Please note that VanEck may have a position(s) in the digital asset(s) described below.\n\nIn this piece we:\n\nWe conclude that Ethereum Layer- 2 landscape is crowded with few winner-take-all characteristics for now.\n\nEvaluate Layer-2 blockchains through a lens of developer experience, user experience, & technical capability.\n\nShow assumptions behind our $1 trillion market cap base case valuation for Ethereum Layer-2s by 2030.\n\nLayer-2 Blockchains Overview\n\nEthereum's dominance in smart contracts faces a critical hurdle: scalability. While the network offers unparalleled security and decentralization, transaction fees and processing times soar when usage intensifies. To overcome this, Layer 2 solutions have emerged, and advancements like the recent fork EIP-4844 promise to unlock even greater scalability for these Ethereum offshoots. Here we analyze an array of Layer 2 solutions from the perspective of transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumption, and ecosystem size.\n\nLayer-2 (L2) blockchains are connected networks that operate on top of a primary blockchain, like Ethereum, to increase its capacity for processing transactions. By handling transactions off the main blockchain and then settling them back on it, L2 solutions help to scale the blockchain's capabilities without compromising its security or decentralization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current capabilities are well-known to be inadequate for hosting all of the globe\u2019s financial transactions. To be more precise, the world\u2019s financial system will need to process more than Ethereum\u2019s long-term limit of around 19.2 USDC or 6.8 Uniswap trades per second. However, this is a limitation by design because Ethereum\u2019s stewards believe that censorship resistance is best achieved by making it inexpensive for anyone to run Ethereum nodes.\n\nThe result is that Ethereum limits its chain\u2019s capabilities to cut down on networking requirements, data storage needs, and computer hardware demands of its nodes. This practically limits how many bytes of data Ethereum can process over a given period of time. As transactions on a blockchain are nothing more than pieces of data that the blockchain agrees are correct, the capabilities of a blockchain can be measured simply by how much useful data it can handle.\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/15/2024.\n\nTo address these constraints, Ethereum's developers initially proposed a \u201csharding\u201d solution, which involved splitting the blockchain into 64 smaller, interconnected sub-blockchains called \u201cshards.\u201d Each of these shards would process transactions within each\u2019s own containerized child blockchains and then submit proofs of the activity to be reconciled by Ethereum\u2019s parent blockchain. While this approach appeared promising, and some of its components debuted on Polkadot starting in 2020, Ethereum developers eventually discarded the sharding plan called Ethereum 2.0. This is because they believed it was technically infeasible and incapable of scaling to Ethereum\u2019s vision of becoming a blockchain for billions of users.\n\nInstead, Ethereum's roadmap shifted towards leveraging Layer-2 (L2) blockchains. These L2 networks handle most transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain, only settling the highest-value transactions directly on it. This approach reduces the load on the main blockchain, allowing it to process more transactions efficiently. In this dynamic, Ethereum accrues value because the costs of these settlements must be paid in ETH; this strategy also reinforces the value of ETH as the true \u201coil\u201d powering the entire ecosystem of connected chains.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum's primary challenge is its limited capacity to process, store, and compute data in the form of financial transactions. This bottleneck in data throughput is being addressed by offloading much of the data processing and computation to Layer-2 blockchains. As a result, Ethereum's development is now concentrated on enhancing its ability to integrate compressed transaction data from these L2 blockchains. But how exactly do these connected blockchains function, and what are their business models?\n\nEthereum Ecosystem Transactions vs. Ethereum Mainnet Market Share\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem is growing while Ethereum\u2019s share is shrinking.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nLayer-2s Role in Scaling Ethereum's Network\n\nLayer-2 (L2) blockchains enhance Ethereum's capabilities by aggregating multiple transactions into condensed bundles, known as \"roll-ups.\u201d These \u201cbundles\u201d of transactions are posted by L2s to Ethereum at various intervals that are spaced apart to balance transaction demand, security, and cost. As such, Ethereum is becoming a \u201cblockchain of blockchains.\u201d\n\nEach L2 generally consists of its own series of smart contracts on Ethereum that keep track of L2 transaction history, facilitate data transfer between the L2 and Ethereum, run fault proof or zk verifier contract (more on this below), and function as an asset escrow between Ethereum and the L2. Very powerful computers called \u201csequencers\u201d ingest and order all the transactions that occur on the L2 blockchains. This is more capable and cheaper than Ethereum because L2s run one very powerful server computer that simply intakes transactions and orders them. This dynamic allows L2s to process greater data throughput than Ethereum. By contrast, Ethereum transaction processing involves 100s of thousands of globally distributed validator nodes sending, interpreting, and agreeing upon transaction data. This takes a lot more time due to the Ethereum consensus process and involves duplicating the work of one computer on each of the 100s of thousands of Ethereum nodes. Logically, a single computer like a sequencer processing transaction is much cheaper and faster than a system of globally dispersed, less capable computers that need to collectively use gigabits of internet bandwidth to message and hundreds of thousands of CPUs to process blockchain transactions.\n\nTypes of Layer-2s: Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs)\n\nThere are two main types of L2s connected to Ethereum: optimistic roll-ups (ORUs) and zero-knowledge roll-ups (ZKUs). Both settle their ledger balances, or \"state,\" on Ethereum by sending a compressed version called a \"Merkle Root.\" ORUs also post a condensed batch of transaction data to allow for verification and traceability of ledger changes over time.\n\nSettlement in Layer-2 blockchains (L2s) can be compared to updating a baseball game's scoreboard inning by inning, with the transaction data serving as the detailed play-by-play. For optimistic roll-ups (ORUs), they operate on the principle of optimism, meaning they are presumed to be accurate unless proven otherwise. If an entity, such as a high-frequency trading firm or a mathematically adept researcher, identifies an incorrect or faulty Merkle root, they can submit a fraud attestation, known as a fault-proof, to Ethereum. Entities monitoring ORUs for fraud have a seven-day window, referred to as a \"challenge period,\" to detect any fraudulent activity following a state update. Once this period concludes, the transactions within the ORU are deemed final. If a fault-proof successfully demonstrates fraud, the smart contract overseeing the ORU's state will revert all transactions to the state before the fraud commenced. The challenge period extends for seven days, after which each batch of transactions is irrevocably finalized.\n\nAt the time of writing, of the forty-six L2s we track through l2beat, only four chains have fraud proofs live. Two of those four are under the umbrella of Arbitrum, which boasts the highest total value locked (TVL) of any L2 at $4.31B and only allows fraud proofs from a whitelisted group of entities.\n\nThe most popular ORUs are Arbitrum, Blast, Optimism, Manta, Metis, Mantle, and Base.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) vs. Annualized Revenues Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs)\n\nSource: Defillama, TokenTerminal as of 3/12/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nA zero-knowledge roll-up (ZKU) operates similarly to an ORU, with one key difference. While ORUs submit both transaction data Merkle roots and state Merkle roots to Ethereum, ZKUs only send a zero-knowledge proof of the transaction data. This is because ZKUs do not operate under the assumption that the submitted state roots are correct. Instead, once the proof is submitted to Ethereum, a smart contract verifies the authenticity of the ZKU's transaction bundle.\n\nAs a result, ZKUs do not have fault proofs because proofs are generated with each state update. Unlike ORUs, ZKU transaction data is considered final once the proof is accepted on Ethereum, ensuring immediate finality and eliminating the need for a challenge period.\n\nThe most important ZKUs are currently Starkware, zkSync, zkScroll, Linea and *c zkEVM\n\nThe base economics of ZKUs and ORUs are very similar to those of L1 blockchains. Both types of roll-ups make money when users create activity on their chains and pay fees in ETH to Ethereum. Currently, all L2s price their transactions in ETH because that is the token needed to settle transaction data to Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2s Revenue Models\n\nRegardless of the process, it is important to understand that transaction ordering has value and that blockchains can make money by selling the rights to transaction ordering. This diagram illustrates how three different transaction sequencing models can create different revenue streams.\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/25/2024. Explanation: Assume that TX2 is a high value transaction, buying $1M of a token on an L2. In FIFO, everyone pays the sequencer the same amount. In Priority Ordering, TX2 pays the sequencer to be first. In Auctioning Specific Slots, TX3 and TX4 pay extra to be ahead of and behind TX2.\n\nLayer-2s Transaction Sequencing: Priority, FIFO, and Auctioning\n\nL2s charge users a fee for transaction inclusion in each block. This is composed of a base fee and a priority fee. Some L2s charge priority fees, like Optimism. Priority fees give users the ability to be first in line at the top of the block of transactions. In the last 6 months, the top 10 L2s on Ethereum made $232M in revenues from user transactions alone. This ability to \u201ccut the line\u201d by paying priority fees benefits users engaging in time-sensitive activities, such as arbitrage trading.\n\nArbitrum adopts a first-in-first-out (FIFO) sequencing approach to transactions as they arrive. In certain cases, users may prefer their transactions to follow specific others on the block. A common strategy, known as \"back-running,\" involves positioning a transaction right after a significant trade to exploit price discrepancies across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for arbitrage opportunities. More malicious transaction ordering techniques, such as \"sandwich attacks,\" involve strategically placing buy orders immediately before a user's planned trade and sell orders immediately after. This manipulation drives up the price of the desired token just before the user's transaction executes, forcing them to purchase at a disadvantageous, inflated price.\n\nOn Ethereum, ordering is monetized by a software addition added to Ethereum\u2019s validator software. This software, called Flashbots, allows for validators to auction off the right to order transactions (and insert their own) to outside entities. This auction generates \"maximal extractable value\" (MEV), adding to the validators' and stakers' yields. While L2s have the potential to monetize MEV by auctioning off block ordering rights, no L2 has officially done so yet. However, trading firms may already be positioning their servers close to L2 servers, akin to practices in equity and commodities exchanges.\n\nLooking forward, many L2s plan to decentralize their sequencer set, which may involve staking tokens \u2014 possibly ETH from an Eigenlayer DA or from each roll-up\u2019s native token. The sequencer decentralization could unlock new revenue streams from MEV. To contextualize, Ethereum's MEV take rate on DEX volume averages around 4 basis points (bps), while other blockchains like Polygon and Solana have rates of 0.4bps and 3.5bps, respectively. These rates likely understate the full scope of MEV due to the challenges in tracking and the incentives to conceal profits. By estimating MEV take rates against DEX volumes, if Arbitrum's MEV was captured at a rate of 3.0bps, it would amount to $58.9 million \u2014 a significant 57% of Arbitrum's fee-only revenue.\n\nArbitrum Revenues with 3bps of MEV on DEX Volumes\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 3/20/2024.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nLayer-2s On-Chain Cost Structures\n\nLayer-2s (L2) primarily incur costs through Ethereum gas fees as they regularly post transaction data, settlements, and proofs to Ethereum. But zero-knowledge roll-ups (ZKUs) and optimistic roll-ups (ORUs) differ in their cost structures. While both update their states on the L1, ORUs have to pay onerous on-chain data costs while ZKUs must expend money proof generations and verification. Regardless, the consequence of the dependence on Ethereum is that the L2s input cost is subject to the volatility of Ethereum blockspace. For the most part, this cost difference is passed on to the user. However, the margins that L2s earn are quite volatile as a result.\n\nPrior to EIP-4844, L2s posted both settlement data and proofs to Ethereum as single transactions in the \u201cmessage field\u201d of each transaction structure called \u201ccall data.\u201d This was a \u201chack\u201d to utilize one component of Ethereum\u2019s standard transaction format for the purpose of holding compressed L2 data. Though this is novel, it is very expensive. For example, for the month of February, Optimism paid $5.7M, Arbitrum paid $7.2M, and Scroll paid $6.7M for posting call data to Ethereum.\n\nSource: VanEck Research, Celestia as of 3/14/2024.\n\nThe cost components for ZKUs are inherently higher compared to ORUs because ZKUs submit both zero-knowledge proofs and call data to Ethereum. While ORUs may also involve proof costs, these are generally outsourced to third parties who challenge the state if needed, and therefore they do not heavily influence ORUs' base costs. The verification of ZKUs\u2019 zero-knowledge proofs on Ethereum can be extremely costly. Despite Ethereum's optimization efforts, such as native op codes to streamline zk-proof verification, the expenses remain significant\u2014for example, Scroll's ZKU incurred $1.1 million in proofing fees in just the first 13 days of March.\n\nAs a result of these high proving costs, the average profit margin for ORUs over the last six months stands at 26.7%, contrasting with 21% for ZKUs. Logically, a roll-up could send more transactions in fewer batches to decrease variable batch posting expenses. Infrequent batch posting, however, could also come as a result of less transaction throughput happening on the L2s. Regardless, L2 batch post frequency to Ethereum is a profitability lever an L2 can pull, but one that comes at the expense of user experience. In practice, L2s decide batch posting as a calculus of how many transactions they can fit into a block, Ethereum L1 gas prices, and each L2 incoming flow of transactions.\n\nL2 Batches Per Day vs. Ethereum Settlement Costs\n\nSource: Dune @niftytable, Etherscan as of 3/14/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nTechnically, L2s can post more expansive understandings of what occurs on L2s besides the simple \u201cscoreboard\u201d settlements. Price competition amongst L2s to serve users the cheapest transactions cause L2s to often choose the most economical data to post. Often, this means just posting \u201cstate differences\u201d for ZKUs, and for ORUs, it means posting highly compressed transaction data. Curiously, though ZKUs do not technically have to post full transaction data, some still do so. While Starknet and zkSync only post \u201cstate differences,\u201d Linea, Polygon, and Scroll post full transaction data. This is done because it may be challenging for things like explorers and wallets to track blockchains without the transaction data. Another possibility is that posting full transaction data allows more transparency so that anyone can run a node to track a ZKU. ZKUs may also be open to opening up a prover to anyone in the future, and posting full transaction data to Ethereum allows ZKUs to \u201cdecentralize\u201d their blockchains at the point of the \u201cprovers.\u201d\n\nA cost reduction that many L2s currently make is to improve the efficiency of their compression. For example, on February 13th, Linea deployed a new compression scheme that increased compression on the chain by a factor of 10x, moving from around 500 bytes per transaction to the mid-50s. Other L2s, both ORUs and ZKUs, had an average transaction size on Ethereum of 300 bytes for 2024. While compressing transactions may save on data costs to the L2, it reduces its potential due to the time it takes to compress transactions.\n\nL2 On Chain Margins by Month\n\nSource: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/13/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nEIP-4844\u2019s Answer to L2 Data Costs: Blob Space\n\nOn March 13, 2024, Ethereum passed the Dencun upgrade, which had a handful of important changes, the most significant of which was the creation of what is called \u201cBlob Space.\u201d Prior to this upgrade, the main challenge for Layer-2s was the prohibitive cost associated with posting transaction data to Ethereum. Recognizing this, Ethereum\u2019s solution was the strategic creation of a specialized data layer, colloquially known as Blob Space, designed exclusively for L2 data postings.\n\nThis newly established layer offers a targeted transaction environment tailored to receiving data from L2 networks. Blob Space's innovative aspect is its transient data handling\u2014data blobs posted here are retained for only four weeks before deletion, significantly reducing Ethereum's data overhead. Consequently, L2s have the option to bypass the main Ethereum layer and directly post to Blob Space.\n\nThe Blob Space layer of Ethereum has its own gas prices that abide by the same rule set as Ethereum\u2019s regular execution layer. The result is that transactions from L2s to publish data no longer have to compete with regular Ethereum transactions for blockspace. The dedicated transaction layer is also designed to price the cost of data much cheaper than posting to Ethereum as call data. At the time of writing, the Data Blobs have reduced gas usage charges to L2s by (-96%).\n\nL2 Data Publishing Costs to Ethereum (ETH)\n\nSource: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nLayer-2s Off-Chain Cost Structures\n\nThe first part of the off-chain cost expense for Layer-2s (L2s) are the sequencers they use for ordering transactions. This is basically just a high-end server that sits in a data center. For most L2s, the foundation or business entity behind that L2 pays for the cost of the sequencer. In the grand scheme of things, the costs of running the sequencers themselves are minor at around $1000 to $2000 in equipment and perhaps another $3000 to 5000 in manpower per month. This cost is consistent for both Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs).\n\nA lesser discussed but significant cost element for ZKUs involves the operation of provers. Unlike sequencers that produce the state root, the provers are responsible for creating the zk-proof that undergoes verification on the Ethereum network. This computational process usually takes place on cloud computing platforms like AWS.\n\nAccording to the decentralized zk prover project Gevulot, the costs of the proof will run between \u201c10-20% of the cost of verification on Ethereum.\u201d Additionally, these costs scale with the amount of transactions that are being generated by each L2s. ZKUs are faced with a balancing act between costs and user experience, with the option to reduce the frequency of proofs posted to Ethereum as a potential cost-saving measure. Through a process known as recursion, ZKU provers can consolidate several proofs into a single submission, which, while increasing off-chain computational demands, can optimize the economics by mitigating the costly proof verifications conducted on Ethereum.\n\nAt the time of writing, all ZKUs run their own provers and directly pay for the costs of proof generation. Over time, however, many intend to decentralize proof generation.\n\nEvaluating Layer-2s Across 5 Key Areas\n\nIn our analysis of key Layer-2s, we use five principal variables to measure potential success or failure:\n\nTransaction pricing \u2013 the cost to users of transacting Developer experience \u2013 the ease of building products and applications User experience \u2013 the simplicity of depositing, withdrawing, and transacting Trust Assumptions - liveness and safety assumptions Ecosystem size \u2013 how many interesting things there are to do\n\n1. Layer-2s Transaction Pricing\n\nThe root of transaction pricing differentiation comes from a combination of data compression, data posting efficiency, L2 scale, proving costs (for ZKUs), and, most interestingly, the margin each L2 takes. L2s could also time their postings to Ethereum based upon gas prices, but in practice, we have not found empirical evidence to support this possibility. This is likely due to the general difficulties of predicting future Ethereum gas prices.\n\nThe main difference in pricing economics between ZKUs and ORUs is that ZKUs have higher fixed costs than ORUs. This is because ZKUs must pay for proof generation off Ethereum and proof verification on Ethereum. Proof generation/verification is a large, static cost that does not increase significantly as more transactions are covered by each proof. By contrast, ORUs must post full transaction data to Ethereum. Though ORUs employ different compression mechanisms to cut down on data costs, posting to Ethereum is very expensive. Because more transactions on an ORU means more data is to be committed to Ethereum, the costs of posts to Ethereum are increased. However, with the EIP-4844, the costs of posting data to Ethereum have been reduced significantly and these savings have resulted in cheaper transaction pricing for ORUs. Likewise, ORUs also have the option of placing transaction data on even cheaper data availability blockchains like Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail. Currently, Manta Pacific and Aevo post transaction data to Celestia.\n\nIn 2024, the cheapest chains by average transaction cost were Mantle ($0.17), zkSync ($0.21), and Starknet ($0.25). Each chain was able to edge out its competition on pricing using different techniques. Mantle, an ORU, is able to keep transactions cheap because it accepts lower than the average margin (19.9%), uses its own data availability (Mantle DA) for full transaction batch posting, and updates its state root updates to Ethereum, the second least frequently at every 20.7 minutes. zkSync, a ZKU, was able to price transactions inexpensively due to the high volume of transactions (94.9M), the highest of any L2, that made its proving system highly economical. Meanwhile, the ZKU chain Starknet settled to Ethereum the least often of any of the top 10 L2s, once every 57.8 minutes, while also posting only state differences in place of full transaction data. These two-cost savings resulted in the least amount of data per transaction being settled to Ethereum. Curiously, we estimate that Starknet lost -$0.09 per transaction through March 13, 2024.\n\nCompetitive Differentiation of L2s\n\nData for 2024. Source: Dune @niftytable, Artemis XYZ as of 3/13/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\n2. Layer-2s Developer Experience\n\nDeveloper experience is another important point of competitive differentiation for Layer-2s. The root understanding of making the developer experience easiest was to implement EVM compatibility. This means that smart contract code, tooling, and developer libraries could be ported over directly from Ethereum to be used on the L2. This is believed to give each L2 an advantage because of Ethereum\u2019s large network of developers. Currently, the vast majority of L2s are EVM-compatible. However, ZKUs often have subtle differences that developers must adhere to due to the limitations of zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nSome developers have also argued that adherence to EVM compatibility is a disadvantage because EVM places significant limitations on blockchain capabilities while boxing out developers who are more familiar with other computer languages. For example, Starknet smart contracts are written in a language called Cairo, which is more efficient for the zero-knowledge scaling of Starknet. Of course, this comes at the tradeoff where anyone deploying to Starknet must learn the complexities of Cairo. Movement Labs is another L2 developer who is allowing smart contracts to be written using the Move language which appeals to developers who know want to learn Move. And for those who are more familiar with the programming language of Solana called Rust, Eclipse is building a Layer-2 blockchain that runs in a Solana Virtual Machine. This is even expanding to other languages like Web Assembly, as Fluent has created a general-purpose L2 which supports WASM.\n\n3. Layer-2s User Experience\n\nUser experience is another plank by which Layer-2s compete with each other. The most basic component of this is onboarding assets and removing assets from an L2. For the most part, onboarding is not significantly differentiated between L2s, with the exception that some Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) allow for native assets to be moved to each L2. For example, Kraken allows users to withdraw USDC to Arbitrum and Optimism, whereas Coinbase allows USDC to be ported to Optimism and Base.\n\nFinality\u2014the point at which transactions on an L2 become irreversible\u2014marks a significant divergence in the user experience between Optimistic Roll-Ups (ORUs) and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups (ZKUs). For ORUs, finality occurs after the fraud challenge period ends, while for ZKUs, finality occurs once a state root and its proof have been posted to Ethereum. One consequence of finality differences is withdrawals off of an L2. For an ORU, 7 days must pass before a user can move his or her funds back to Ethereum. For a ZKU, this same process can take as little as an hour, and this depends on how frequently the ZKU posts settlements and proofs, as well as each chain\u2019s safety system. While zkSync posts proofs every 6 minutes and state updates every hour, users must have a 24-hour wait period before assets can be bridged to Ethereum due to zkSync\u2019s safety modules.\n\nCurrent Throughput and Latency\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nWhen users interact with L2s, familiar tools and interfaces are paramount. The adoption of familiar wallets and blockchain explorers from Ethereum to L2s greatly enhances user comfort. This seamlessness is pivotal, as most L2s employ analogous experiences to Ethereum, ensuring a minimal learning curve for those moving across platforms. In the realm of quantifiable user experience metrics, latency and throughput stand out. Latency refers to the time it takes for a transaction to be acknowledged by the network after submission, while throughput measures the network's capacity to handle transactions per second.\n\nThe slowest block time, or Round-Trip Time (RTT)\u2014the duration for a user's transaction to reach the sequencer and for the confirmation to be received back\u2014typically defines an L2's latency. Arbitrum, for instance, boasts the potential for extremely low latency at 0.25 seconds, though actual latency may vary based on geographical factors and the user's proximity to the sequencer, which is speculated to be located in a Silicon Valley data center.\n\nzkSync is noted for having the highest theoretical throughput, capable of processing up to 434 swap transactions per second. However, both latency and throughput are adjustable parameters within L2 networks.\n\nThe current bottlenecks for ZKUs are the speed at which their provers can handle incoming transactions, while ORUs are constrained by the efficiency of their transaction data compression and the rate at which Ethereum can absorb this data. At present, L2s voluntarily limit their throughput in alignment with Ethereum's capacity. If an L2 were to use Ethereum\u2019s block space fully\u2014considering Ethereum's current data cap of about 937.5kb per block plus an additional 375kb from three data blobs\u2014this could theoretically expand to approximately 1.3 MB per block, or 110kb per second.\n\nFor a specific L2 like zkSync, which averages 62 bytes per transaction, fully exploiting Ethereum block space could potentially surge to 1764 transactions per second. In contrast, an ORU like Arbitrum, with an average of 255 bytes per transaction, could reach a processing rate of 429 transactions per second under the same conditions.\n\nFurther increases in throughput could be achieved by integrating a Data Availability blockchain such as Celestia. However, this approach raises concerns about compromising user safety, as alternative blockchains may not offer the same level of security assurances as Ethereum. The choice to expand throughput in this manner is a delicate one, requiring a balance between improved performance and the inherent safety that Ethereum's robustness provides.\n\n4. Layer-2s Trust Assumptions\n\nSource: VanEck Research, l2beat as of 3/19/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nThere are substantial differences in the assurance of safety and liveness that L2s offer users. Safety refers to the blockchain\u2019s properties to ensure that only an account owner can access his/her assets, while liveness refers to the safeguards in place to make sure assets can be utilized. As L2s rest upon a single sequencer who both orders a block and \u201cproposes\u201d it to the L1 (Ethereum) for settlement, the sequencer failure is the chief concern for L2 users. This is because each L2 currently operates a single sequencer, and if it fails, that L2 cannot process transactions. While assets cannot be stolen in the event of an outage, they also cannot be accessed by users until that outage is resolved. At the same time, if a malicious entity is able to take over a sequencer, it is possible they could mint fraudulent transactions to take the assets off an L2. The current point of weakness of all L2s is they each operate only one sequencer and that sequencer is usually centrally operated by the foundation behind the L2.\n\nL2 builders realize the issues posed by sequencer failure or takeover, and some implement novel safety valves. These differ depending on the L2 and its safety. To complicate matters, some of these safety measures open up the possibility for other attack areas. Some of the guard rails created to protect users include allowing users, under certain conditions, to remove assets, submit transactions for the L2 blockchain by using the L1 host, or even propose L2 blocks. Mostly, these conditions occur when there is a clear failure somewhere in the L2 system.\n\nSome L2s are developing frameworks where anyone can be a sequencer as well as allowing for multiple sequencers who each take a turn sequencing. This would be accompanied by people running the sequencers to put up an economic bond (most likely each L2 native token) to create penalties for cheaters. Companies like Espresso, Astria, and Fairblock are examples of projects that are building software for decentralized sequencers. Currently, the L2 Metis is furthest along in pioneering decentralized sequencers on its L2. Metis\u2019s community has recently passed a governance vote that creates the framework for decentralizing its sequencer and allowing for multiple sequencers to exist.\n\nThe next point of trust assumption variation, one we discuss above, is referred to as \u201cdata availability.\u201d While ZKUs provide proof that state updates are correct, ORUs provide evidence to allow anyone to prove that a state update is incorrect. In both cases, however, it is important to understand where the data comes from to generate proofs for either ZKUs or ORUs. Ideally, this data would be readily \u201cavailable\u201d on the L1 (Ethereum) so that anyone could verify the underlying data that generates proof. Blockchains such as Immutable X and Metis, keep full transaction data on other locations. Though ZKUs do not need to post full transaction data, chains like Linea and Polygon zkEVM do, while Starknet and zkSync simply post state differences. Additionally, L2s post the data to Ethereum, while others post it to dedicated data availability blockchains like Celestia. Posting data on other chains arguably makes an L2 less safe than Ethereum because it introduces new trust assumptions.\n\nAnother interesting dynamic for ORUs is that, as it stands, almost none of them allow for fraud-proof. This means that anyone using them is subject to censorship (transactions not going through) by the sequencer. The exception to this is Arbitrum, which allows fraud proofs. But even in Arbitrum\u2019s case, only white-listed entities can submit fraud proofs. ZKUs, on the other hand, rely upon the prover (a different entity from the sequencer) posting proof. In the event that the ZKUs prover fails, some chains allow users to submit their own proofs (just do zero-knowledge math!) for transactions to be included on the L2.\n\nRegardless, Layer-2s have many issues with respect to their trust assumptions. However, they currently have hundreds of thousands of daily active users, so it would seem until there is a major issue, no one will care. To simplify our views on the set of safeguards L2s have in place, we rank them from most risky to least risky and find Arbitrum to be the current, although still inadequate, gold standard.\n\n5. Layer-2s Ecosystem Size\n\nBridged TVL of L2s\n\nSource: Dune @21co as of 3/19/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nThe most important competitive factor of L2s is the ecosystem that each L2 has created. Blockchain is a marketplace of services and digital commodities. The more useful things to do on a blockchain, the more value it will accrue through user transactions, demand for its native token, and network effect. Unfortunately, the metrics that measure blockchain activity do not always properly translate into the value of that blockchain\u2019s ecosystem. Applying Goodhart\u2019s law contends that once a metric becomes important in crypto, there is a higher chance that the metrics become manipulated. This rule becomes even more ironclad when we consider airdrop farmers (see our third paragraph from our January Monthly for an explanation) who are generating meaningless activity to receive a free airdrop of token value.\n\nGenerally, what matters are users who are willing to bring value to a blockchain to engage in meaningful activity to generate fees. In that respect, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Blast have shown they have ecosystems that matter to users as those users have bridged $16.3B, $7.85B, and $2.43B to each respectfully. For the most part, Layer-2s have generated user interest and activity through airdrops of their native tokens. Optimism, for example, has given away nearly 25% of its current floating supply to users in the form of airdrops for activity. Arbitrum has given away over $1.84B in tokens to individuals who have used Arbitrum. Blast has leveraged this concept even further to attract bridged value on the premise that there may be an airdrop of tokens from Blast itself, as well as teams who are building on Blast. Conceptually, Layer-2s compete by giving away, for free, tokens whose value grows as each L2 network grows.\n\nFully Diluted Value (FDV)/Revenue and Market Capitalization (MC)/Revenue\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 3/21/2024. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nBy measure of the trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue to fully diluted valuation (FDV) multiples, each L2\u2019s multiple exceeds Ethereum\u2019s by a fair margin. However, this dynamic changes if we alter the multiple to being based upon floating token supply rather than fully diluted value. This is an odd disconnect that relates to the release schedule of L2 coins \u2013 most L2 projects have only released a fraction of their supply. Realistically, we see L2s trading more on speculation of long-term value accrual rather than current revenue dynamics. We attribute this dynamic to the potential for substantially more future revenues to occur on L2s than on Ethereum.\n\nWe expect L2 revenues to exceed Ethereum\u2019s because Ethereum cannot match the transaction throughput or user experience of L2s. We also increasingly see a state where the general-purpose roll-ups market is consolidated by a few major players. This is due to the network effect of both on chain application composability and shared value. It is also attributed to roll-up frameworks, like the OP Stack or Arbitrum Orbit, becoming dominant and the OP/ARB token accruing value from other L2 or even Layer-3s (blockchains that submit state to the L2s). It is also clear that most roll-ups will eventually move towards the zero-knowledge framework (ZKU) due to its many advantages.\n\nLong-term, we still believe that Ethereum blockspace will be expensive, and one result may be that many L2s consolidate proofs to a unified proving layer that \u201crecursively\u201d combines all proofs of its layer constituents. This may be particularly true in the case of application and sector-specific roll-ups. An example of what a concept may look like is Polygon\u2019s Aggregation. Conceptionally, something like an \u201cAgg Layer\u201d may also vastly improve user experience because it would be more economical to post proofs and state roots often enough to allow for bridging across L2s and Ethereum in seconds rather than hours.\n\nAccordingly, we see cutthroat competition amongst L2s where the network effect is the only moat. As a result, we are generally bearish on the long-term value prospects for the majority of L2 tokens. The top 7 tokens for L2 collectively already have $40B of FDV, and there are many strong projects that intend to launch over the medium term. This means there is potentially $100B more in FDV in L2 tokens coming to market over the next 12-18 months. It seems a bridge too far for the crypto market to absorb even limited amounts of that supply without massive discounts. Additionally, while there are reasons to believe that some L2 tokens will become valuable, the pathways to value accrual are harder to project than they are for other crypto sectors. This is particularly the case since L2 tokens are not even the base money in their own ecosystems.\n\nBeyond the dominance of a few roll-ups among general-purpose L2s, we forecast a future of thousands of use-case-specific roll-ups. These L2 will be segmented by sector, application, or function. Businesses will likely build roll-ups explicitly as their own revenue and/or cost centers like building an asset management Layer-2 chain. Other types of chains may be specifically geared towards hosting a whole sector, such as a roll-up that hosts a social media network, as well as applications that want to build products and services for that social media network.\n\nEthereum Layer-2s Valuation Prediction by 2030\n\nWe find our 2030 valuation for the L2 space by applying an FCF terminal multiple to our expectations of future cash flows. We estimate the revenues that feed these cash flows by:\n\nTransactions Revenues (inclusion of transactions on a blockchain) Estimating the revenue TAM of end markets that could utilize public blockchains Calculating the amount of TAM that will actually use public blockchains Forecasting the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s market share public blockchains Applying take rates on end market revenues that utilize Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem for settlement and transactions Splitting the transaction value between Ethereum and L2s MEV (ordering of transactions on blockchain) Estimating the value of assets including currency, securities, and digital assets that will be secured by Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem Project DEX volume on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem by applying an asset turnover estimate to our forecasts for the hosted asset value of the Ethereum ecosystem Multiplying DEX volumes by an MEV take rate to arrive at total MEV value Splitting the value between Ethereum and its L2s\n\nL2 Valuation - Base Case Ethereum Ecosystem Smart Contract Market Share 60% L2 Economics Estimated Revenue 2030 ($M) $48,659 Global Tax Rate on Crypto 15% Sequencer Cut 1% Value to Tokenholders in 2030 ($M) $40,947 FCF Terminal Multiple 25 L2 FDV 2030 ($M) $1,023,681 L2 Projections Transaction Value on L2 90% Ecosystem TVL Layer 2 90% L2 Token MEV Capture (Split to L2) 100% L2 Transaction Capture (split to L2) 66% MEV Revenue MEV LT Take Rate on DEX Volume 0.02% LT L2DEX Volume/TVL Ratio 12 MEV Value Accrual to Token 95% Crypto Terminal Market Share Base Finance, Banking, Payments 5% Metaverse, Social and Gaming 20% Infrastructure 10% Ethereum Ecosystem Value Capture of End Market Revenue Finance, Banking, Payments 3% Metaverse, Social and Gaming 10% Infrastructure 5%\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 3/21/2024.

        "title": "What Is Blast on Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "Blast is a new Ethereum layer 2 that introduces the concept of native yield for ETH and stablecoins.\n\nBlast is a new Ethereum layer 2 network that has made waves after introducing the concept of native yield. Unlike other layer 2 solutions, Blast users can earn yield paid in crypto simply by having certain tokens in their wallets.\n\nRead on to learn about Blast, how it works, and what it is bringing to Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is Blast on Ethereum?\n\nBlast is an EVM-compatible Ethereum layer 2 platform that offers native yield for ether and stablecoins. It operates as an optimistic rollup solution to tackle scalability issues on Ethereum by increasing the network\u2019s capacity for more transactions at lower costs.\n\nBlast\u2019s testnet went live in January 2024, and its mainnet launched in February. The platform, founded by Tieshun Pacman Roquerre (the creator of NFT marketplace Blur), has surpassed $1 billion in total value locked at the time of writing.\n\nThe project is different from other Ethereum layer 2 solutions as it offers native yields for both ETH and stablecoins.\n\nHow Does Blast Work?\n\nBlast yield income for decentralized finance (DeFi) users comes from the concept of Ethereum staking. Ethereum staking is a process on the Ethereum network whereby users can temporarily lock tokens to validate transactions.\n\nTraditionally, managing staking requires individual attention from users. However, Blast simplifies this process by handling staking on behalf of its users within its ecosystem, making it an L2 platform with native yield.\n\nWhen assets are bridged to the Ethereum mainchain within Blast\u2019s network, they are automatically staked, initiating the interest-earning process. Blast\u2019s smart contracts facilitate the collection of this interest, which is automatically redistributed to users in the form of ether (ETH) and stablecoins.\n\nHow Does Blast Offer Yield?\n\nBlast offers a 4% interest rate for ETH and a 5% interest rate for stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI deposited on the network. These interest rates are compounded, meaning they apply to the balance over time rather than the initial deposit.\n\nThe native yield feature is powered by rebasing tokens and is based on the Risk-free Interest Rate (RFR) yield structure.\n\nThe 4% yield on Ethereum is sourced through liquid staking on the Ethereum network. After the merge, the proof-of-stake (PoS) on the Ethereum network offers a 4% APR on staked ETH. Blast utilizes this feature through partnerships with platforms like Lido, leveraging staked user assets for yield generation.\n\nSimilarly, stablecoins bridged to Blast are routed to T-bill protocols, such as MakerDAO, where they generate yields. Blast channels them to MakerDAO\u2019s T-bill protocol, and users receive USDB on Blast. USDB accumulates stablecoin profits over time at a 5% APR, and users can redeem the asset for USDC when they bridge back from Blast.\n\nWhat Does Blast Bring to the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nBlast\u2019s main aim is to enhance transaction efficiency on the Ethereum network. The layer 2 solution operates on Ethereum but doesn\u2019t rely on the full processing power of the main chain. The move ensures that transactions remain reliable and decentralized while enhancing scalability.\n\nThe L2 also tackles asset depreciation by providing users with a \u201crisk-free\u201d interest rate, regardless of the coin\u2019s value. By providing both ETH and T-Bill yields, Blast ensures users receive benefits similar to those on the mainchain but adds optimistic rollup services and other layer 2 network scaling solutions.\n\nCompared to Ethereum\u2019s core network, which can only process roughly 15 transactions per second, Blast can process thousands of transactions per second by grouping them together. Thus, transactions can be confirmed more quickly, resulting in a more responsive and seamless user experience.\n\nThe Blast Airdrop\n\nTo participate in the airdrop, users need to obtain an invitation link from their peers through a referral. Users can then register on the airdrop page to claim their sign-up reward. Registered participants can unlock additional rewards by bridging assets to the platform or inviting other users.\n\nNotably, airdrop points are granted based on the value of assets bridged and the number of users successfully referred.\n\nWhile the bridge to Blast is operational, participants in the airdrop campaign can only redeem their accumulated airdrop points beginning May 2024. Part of the airdrop is designated for Season 3 of Blur participants.\n\nFurthermore, part of the airdrop is set aside for developers, particularly winners of the Big Bang contest and mainnet dApps. Developers can reallocate their airdrop points to users, thus enhancing liquidity and expanding the user base.\n\nChallenges and Controversies Associated With Blast\n\nThe crypto community has raised some questions regarding the project\u2019s operations and the validity of its promises.\n\nBlast\u2019s holding contract for deposited assets is safeguarded by a multi-signature mechanism involving five participants. At least three of these participants must consent to approve any withdrawal request. However, the identities of these five participants remain undisclosed, as the project founder operates under a Twitter pseudonym. Furthermore, the criterion for signature approval remains unclear.\n\nFurthermore, questions have been raised regarding the rebase structure and the native yield arrangement. While Blast developers and project partners have strongly supported the project, comments on the rebase token design suggest differing opinions on its feasibility and efficiency.\n\nThe network\u2019s security has also recently become an issue. Munchables, a GameFi platform operating on Blast, disclosed recently that it experienced a security breach resulting in a loss of $62 million. Additionally, an associated vault on Juice Finance avoided a $25 million loss due to a typographical error.\n\nHowever, unlike other hacks, the hacker lacked leverage due to Blast\u2019s multiple centralized components, which eliminated any chance for the attacker to attempt to launder the stolen funds. Eventually, the attacker relinquished control of the private keys.\n\nConclusion\n\nBlast has gained traction, achieving a total value lock (TVL) exceeding $1 billion. The network aims to transform the crypto and gaming industries by providing a layer 2 solution with native yield.\n\nHowever, the project is still in its early stages and has much to prove, including liquidity efficiency and native yield arrangement over time."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Restaking? - Ledger",
        "content": "What Is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nBy Ola Kalejaye\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Ethereum restaking is a novel concept that aims to extend the cryptoeconomic security of Ethereum to new protocols while compounding rewards for stakers.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The process involves using staked Ether or Liquid Staking Tokens to simultaneously stake on another Ethereum protocol, which some commentators warn could ultimately compromise the base network\u2019s resilience.\n\n\n\n\u2014 EigenLayer, the protocol that introduced restaking, sees it as a way to supercharge innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem by establishing pooled decentralized security.\n\nAs the heart of all blockchain networks, the importance of consensus mechanisms can\u2019t be overstated. In the case of the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, its proof-of-stake consensus model is a crucial part of its security and function. At present, the Ethereum network is shored up by nearly 1 million network validators and over 31 million staked Ether, lending it formidable security.\n\nOf course, creating a network of validators even a fraction of the size of Ethereum\u2019s is a challenging and costly task. This serves as a major roadblock for new and emerging protocols in the ecosystem, stifling what might otherwise be promising innovations.\n\nBut what if there was a way to leverage Ethereum\u2019s established security for new projects being built on the network? Could that unlock a whole new level of progress for the ecosystem as a whole?\n\nThat\u2019s the thinking behind Ethereum restaking, a concept that wants to share Ethereum\u2019s validator network for the benefit of new protocols, stakers, and the Ethereum community at large.\n\nBut just what is ETH restaking? How does it work, and are there any risks when it comes to restaking your ETH? In this article, Ledger Academy will walk you through all of that and more.\n\nEthereum Staking and Restaking: Explained\n\nTo understand restaking, let\u2019s take a step back and look at what staking is and how it works on the Ethereum network.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Staking Work?\n\nEthereum staking is the basis for the network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus model. One way to look at staking is as a collateral system that helps keep Ethereum secure.\n\nIf someone wants to act as an Ethereum validator, they must first put up a stake of (at least) 32 ETH. In return for processing transactions, they receive staking rewards. Conversely, if the validator acts dishonestly or does anything that could harm the network, they may lose their staked ETH via a process called slashing.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Restaking?\n\nAs the name implies, Ethereum restaking is the process of taking ETH that has already been staked on Ethereum and using it to simultaneously secure other decentralized protocols. As with normal staking, restaking earns users staking rewards from the protocol(s) they help to secure.\n\nWhile earning extra rewards is a major incentive for restaking, it isn\u2019t the main reason for the concept. The larger idea behind restaking is so that less developed protocols can take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s robust community of network validators: something that is costly and resource-intensive to do otherwise.\n\nNotably, the restaking mechanism did not come about as the result of an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) or the Ethereum Roadmap. Rather, it was designed by a third-party protocol, EigenLayer.\n\nEigenLayer: The Origin of ETH Restaking\n\nFounded in 2021, EigenLayer is an Ethereum middleware platform, which simply means that it sits between the Layer 1 network and other applications, allowing them to interact. As of yet, EigenLayer is the only decentralized protocol that offers ETH restaking.\n\nEigenLayer deploys Ethereum smart contracts that allow stakers to restake their ETH on compatible protocols. The platform also acts as a staking marketplace, allowing the three main parties involved\u2014stakers, network validators, and protocols\u2014to find each other.\n\nSince its initial launch in June 2023, EigenLayer has enjoyed massive growth, becoming one of the largest blockchain protocols out there. Over $10 billion worth of ETH has been restaked through EigenLayer, giving it a higher total value locked (TVL) than major DeFi platforms such as Aave, Rocket Pool, and Uniswap.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s rapid ascent speaks to an obvious demand for restaking and the added rewards that it brings users. But how exactly do users earn these rewards? To understand fully, let\u2019s dive into how Ethereum restaking works\n\nHow Does Restaking ETH Work?\n\nCurrently, EigenLayer is the only option you have to restake your ETH. So let\u2019s explore how this project approaches the mechanism.\n\nSmart Contracts: EigenPod\n\nRestaking on EigenLayer allows its smart contracts to place additional slashing conditions on your staked ETH. This is how EigenLayer extends Ethereum\u2019s security to the protocols In its ecosystem, which it calls Actively Validated Services (AVSs). If a restaking validator doesn\u2019t perform their duties for their AVS, they are subject to having their ETH stake slashed.\n\nThis happens through on-chain slashing contracts and specific smart contracts called EigenPods. You can think of these as an additional account that sits between a restaker\u2019s wallet and their stake. Staking withdrawals and rewards all have to go through the EigenPod before going to a validator\u2019s account, which gives EigenLayer the ability to enact penalties on validators who act poorly.\n\nNative Restaking vs. Liquid Restaking\n\nNative restaking follows a similar process to natively staking ETH, meaning that this option is only available to those willing to run (or already running) an Ethereum validator node. The only difference with native restaking is that an EigenPod becomes the withdrawal address for your stake.\n\nAs for liquid restaking, it\u2019s important to first consider how liquid staking works.\n\nSimilarly to native staking, liquid staking involves locking tokens up in a smart contract. The key difference, however, is that the liquid staking platform then gives you liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in return. You can then use these LSTs as you would any other token on DeFi applications. Liquid restaking, therefore, is when users deposit LSTs into the EigenLayer contracts.\n\nEigenLayer currently supports staking for 12 LSTs, including popular options like Rocket Pool Ether (rETH), Lido Staked Ether (stETH), and Coinbase Staked Ether (cbETH).\n\nSignificantly, some platforms expand liquid restaking utility even further. For example, the protocols Renzo and EtherFi both serve as liquid restaking platforms for EigenLayer. These protocols accept users\u2019 LSTs and give them Liquid Restaking/Receipt Tokens (LRTs) in return.\n\nSeveral liquid restaking platforms have emerged recently, looking to expand restaking utility even further. Similarly to liquid staking, users restake their LSTs with these platforms and receive Liquid Restaking/Receipt Tokens (LRTs) in return.\n\nDelegation\n\nOnce you have successfully staked your ETH or deposited your LSTs, you then have to delegate your stake. The entities that you delegate to \u2013 the ones directly helping to run Actively Validated Services on EigenLayer \u2013 are called operators.\n\nSimilarly to staking ETH, there are two options here. You can either act as an operator and self-delegate, or you can delegate your stake to an existing operator. While simply delegating your stake to an operator is the simplest option, self-delegation gives you more control and responsibility. Importantly, stakers can not dictate to operators what AVS they operate.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Restaking ETH?\n\nMore Rewards for ETH Stakers\n\nThe clearest benefit of restaking Ether is that it compounds rewards for stakers. While the exact rate of staking rewards fluctuates over time and varies depending on the staking platform, ETH stakers can expect an annual percentage yield of roughly 3%. In other words, you would earn around 3% of the amount you stake over one year.\n\nBy restaking, you can supplement your ETH staking rewards with rewards from multiple other protocols. Of course, the rate of rewards will depend on the specific AVS that your staked ETH is going towards.\n\nLower Costs for Startup Protocols\n\nThe other major benefit of ETH restaking is how it lowers costs for new protocols being built on Ethereum. To explain, before the arrival of restaking, new protocols would have to go through the costly process of developing their own validator networks. Thanks to restaking, new protocols can now take advantage of Ethereum\u2019s well-developed validator network. This concept, where decentralized protocols can share validator-powered security, is known as pooled security.\n\nAvoids Layer 2 Restrictions\n\nDue to the high costs associated with launching a new protocol on Ethereum, projects previously went to Layer 2 blockchains as a solution. While these networks can lower costs for new protocols, they also come with some drawbacks.\n\nThe design of some Layer 2 chains can lead to certain constraints on protocol architecture such as customization options and the kinds of transactions a protocol can access. Staying and building on Ethereum and using the pooled security that restaking brings means that protocols are freer to build the architecture that best suits their needs, without constraints.\n\nBesides being good for the individual protocols, this is also a major benefit to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. The more protocols that can be built on Layer 1, the more innovation can happen without liquidity siphoning off to other chains.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Restaking?\n\nIncreases The Risk of Slashing\n\nAs previously mentioned, slashing is a vital component of proof-of-stake systems that helps to keep participants honest. That being said, the nature of slashing means that it can also have negative consequences for people even when they\u2019re not doing any explicit harm to the network.\n\nFor example, many ETH stakers do not act as network validators themselves, meaning that they simply delegate their stake to a validator. If their delegated validator behaved poorly, these stakers could still stand to lose their stake to slashing.\n\nSlashing can also be a risk even for validators who are acting honestly. To sum up briefly, because validators can get a slashing penalty if their node goes offline, many validators set up backup rigs. However, if the network detects the same validator keys coming from two different servers, it also punishes this with slashing (to prevent double-spending).\n\nThat\u2019s all to say that, no matter how it is done, staking always comes with some level of slashing risk. Therefore by restaking, you are necessarily increasing the risk that you could become subject to slashing.\n\nEffect on ETH Liquidity\n\nAlthough restaking arguably works to keep more ETH within the ecosystem, you must remember that staked ETH is not available. Not to mention that even when you unstake your restaked ETH, you will likely have to wait longer than you would otherwise to withdraw it.\n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nIf more restaking protocols like EigenLayer entice enough people with the promise of higher staking rewards, this could lead to fewer independent stakers, and more people staking via such protocols. This effectively causes staking to become more centralized over time.\n\nConcerns Around LRTs\n\nAs previously mentioned, the growth of restaking has brought about a new class of instruments: liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). As these tokens mimic the surge in popularity of LSTs, it\u2019s important to be aware of the risks they carry.\n\nFor one thing, there\u2019s the convoluted nature of LRTs. After all, an LRT is a token representing a staked token, which is itself a representation of a staked token. This added complexity raises questions on exactly how LRT providers will distribute losses and gains.\n\nAdd onto this the newness of the asset class, and there are likely to be some hiccups as platforms look to hook new users with promises of large yields and unproven tokenomics.\n\nPotential Effect on Ethereum\u2019s Social Consensus\n\nFinally, some believe that using Ethereum\u2019s validator network as the basis of pooled security can have a destabilizing effect on the base network. One such critic is none other than Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a May 2023 blog post, Buterin examines the growing trend of protocols leveraging Ethereum\u2019s validator network and argues that certain use cases can introduce high systemic risks to the ecosystem. Specifically, Buterin warns that protocols relying on Ethereum\u2019s social consensus could be a slippery slope.\n\nEthereum\u2019s social consensus refers to the large global community of Ethereum developers and other users, who are constantly monitoring the network. This social consensus is vital for the health of the network, as the community can always act to secure the network if its cryptoeconomic consensus fails due to a bug or attack.\n\nButerin\u2019s concern is that the people building protocols could begin to view hard forks as a way of bailing them out if anything goes wrong. Ultimately, he goes on to say that as long as projects only seek to use Ethereum\u2019s validator set, and not its social consensus, they remain low risk. Notably, EigenLayer founder, Sreeram Kannan, agrees with Buterin\u2019s conclusions, reiterating that an Ethereum fork should never be viewed as a potential solution for a protocol\u2019s issues.\n\nHow To Restake ETH on EigenLayer\n\nThere are two ways to use EigenLayer to restake Ether: native restaking and liquid restaking.\n\nHow to initiate Native restaking on EigenLayer\n\nHere\u2019s how you can natively restake ETH on EigenLayer:\n\nConnect your wallet to the EigenLayer App, ensuring you are connected to the Ethereum mainnet. Click \u201cCreate EigenPod\u201d If you are successful, you will see the EigenPod address come up on the right of your screen. Now that you have your Eigen Pod address, you can deposit your 32 ETH stake to the Beacon Chain just as you normally would to stake ETH. The key step here is that you must set the EigenPod address as the withdrawal credentials for your staking rewards. Once you deposit your stake, it takes about four hours to finalize. After that, you\u2019re free to choose an operator to delegate your stake to.\n\nHow to initiate Liquid restaking on EigenLayer\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get involved in liquid staking you can take the following steps to deposit your LSTs into EigenLayer.\n\nRemember, you can easily exchange ETH for LSTs through Stader Labs or Lido directly from Ledger Live.\n\nConnect your wallet to the EigenLayer app, ensuring you are connected to the Ethereum mainnet. Select the LST you want to restake from the list. Enter the amount of LSTs you want to restake and click \u201cDeposit\u201d. If it\u2019s your first time depositing an LST you\u2019ll need to set a token approval in order to restake. After confirming the token approval, you can confirm the deposit transaction. If the transaction is successful, you\u2019ll see your deposit in your \u201cRestaked balance\u201d on the app.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum Restaking and Pooled Blockchain Security\n\nAll in all, Ethereum restaking is a thoroughly exciting proposition that has brought the concept of pooled security to the forefront of blockchain innovation. Not only can it increase the benefits of staking Ethereum, but it also creates exciting opportunities for up-and-coming blockchain protocols.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re ready to jump into the world of Ethereum staking and staking rewards then look no further than Ledger! Staking Ether on Ledger Live couldn\u2019t be easier. When paired with the power of self-custody unlocked by Ledger hardware wallets, you\u2019ll have everything to take on the world of Ethereum staking.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Find the Ledger device that\u2019s right for you and start enjoying the freedom of secure self-custody."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhether Ethereum (ETH) is a security or commodity has been a hot topic for some time now. But banking giant JP Morgan\u2019s analysts say that it could avoid being designated as a security due to the increased decentralization of the project.\n\nThe firm issued a report Wednesday highlighting a drop in the amount of Ethereum being staked through one of the largest staking projects in the industry.\n\n\u201cIn another positive for the Ethereum network, the share of Lido in staked ETH has decreased further from around one third a year ago to around a quarter at the moment,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis should reduce concerns about concentration in the Ethereum network, thus raising the chance that Ethereum will avoid being designated as security in the future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the crypto world, staking is when users pledge cryptocurrency to the network to keep it running. Ethereum requires staking because it now runs on a proof-of-stake blockchain\u2014which uses validators instead of miners to secure the network.\n\nSome raised concerns that ETH was becoming more centralized as a result of its transition to proof of stake because centralized entities like Lido, Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance were where most of the staking was being done.\n\nJP Morgan noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously acknowledged that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities because there is no \u201ccontrolling group.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s position on Ethereum as a security is important as it currently weighs multiple applications for a U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded product. The SEC has gone after many crypto companies it deems are breaking laws for selling unregistered securities. The federal regulator has opened a public comment period on proposals from three major players looking to enter the space.\n\nThe price of Ethereum now stands at $3,418, per CoinGecko data, up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a world where cryptocurrencies represent not just a form of currency but a burgeoning ecosystem of innovation and community, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Furrever Token (FURR) stand as beacons of the varied paths digital currencies can take. As ETH and SOL navigate through the choppy waters of market volatility and technical resistances, FURR emerges with a promise of novelty and community-centric appeal, charting a course towards a different kind of success. This juxtaposition of the established giants against an up-and-coming contender like FURR highlights the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the crypto market, illustrating the diversity of strategies and outcomes within this digital frontier.\n\nEthereum's Struggle: Failing to Break $3,650 Resistance Amid Market Volatility\n\nEthereum (ETH) navigates a stormy sea in today\u2019s unpredictable crypto market, feeling the ripple effects of Bitcoin's recent downturn. Efforts to surpass the formidable $3,650 resistance barrier have yet to bear fruit, stirring anxieties within the investment community.\n\nAfter a stern rebuff at the $3,650 milestone, Ethereum's valuation took a steep dive, breaching successive supports at $3,550, then $3,500, and $3,450, before stabilizing around the pivotal $3,320 mark. Despite a flicker of resilience, with values inching above $3,360, the path to recovery is fraught with hurdles, notably staying above $3,500 and the critical 100-hour Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance looms at $3,400, with a more daunting challenge at $3,420, just shy of the trendline. Should Ethereum conquer the $3,450 resistance, a surge towards $3,720 might be on the horizon, pending a decisive breach of $3,650. Yet, ambitions of reaching $3,880 hang in balance, contingent on overcoming these obstacles.\n\nThe immediate future for Ethereum is laced with uncertainty. Failure to breach the $3,420 mark could precipitate a further descent, with initial support pegged at $3,320. Dropping below this threshold could target lower supports at $3,250 and, more critically, at $3,220. With technical indicators like the hourly MACD signaling waning momentum and the RSI stuck below 50, the outlook leans bearish. Nonetheless, surmounting the $3,420 hurdle could ignite a recovery, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the gloom.\n\nSolana's Market Dynamics: A 9% Dip Contrasted with $4.6 Billion TVL Growth and Investor Optimism\n\nSolana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a 9% decrease in its trading value, now hovering around $179. Despite this dip, the ecosystem around Solana remains vibrant, evidenced by a remarkable increase in total value locked (TVL) in its decentralized applications (dApps), exceeding $4.6 billion. This boost, driven largely by the meme coin craze, marks a significant leap in the platform's adoption, hinting at a bright future for SOL's pricing trends.\n\nThe premium on the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) showcases an enduring optimism among institutional investors towards SOL, reflecting a strong conviction in the long-term viability and expansion of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nYet, SOL faces challenges in overcoming the $197 resistance level, with its price oscillating around $184. Although it has seen some upward movement, sustaining gains above $197 remains a challenge, pointing to immediate hurdles in price stability.\n\nSOL\u2019s price movement is influenced by a combination of factors, including significant transactions, technical analyses, and market sentiment. Notable large-scale transfers to Coinbase, amounting to more than 800,000 SOL, suggest potential market pressure that could lead to selling. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicate a slowdown in purchasing momentum, possibly foreshadowing a price drop. Furthermore, a decline in derivatives market interest hints at a temporary softening in SOL\u2019s market strength.\n\nDespite these short-term challenges, the underlying strength of Solana's ecosystem and the continued interest from investors suggest resilience and the possibility of a recovery in SOL\u2019s value. As the market conditions evolve, investors are encouraged to consider these dynamics carefully while navigating Solana's fluctuating landscape.\n\nEnthralling the Digital Economy: Furrever Token's Pre-Launch Success with $614K and a Vibrant Cat-Themed Community\n\nAmidst the ongoing fluctuations that have challenged stalwarts like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the Furrever Token (FURR) makes a remarkable entry into the cryptocurrency arena, bringing with it a wave of novelty and enthusiasm. In a time when the crypto giants are facing instability, FURR carves out its niche with an innovative and delightful approach centered on cat motifs, offering a refreshing oasis in the digital currency landscape.\n\nFurrever Token is not merely a means for transactions; it embodies a vision aimed at infusing the cryptocurrency ecosystem with positive vibes and a sense of unity.

        "content": "Ethereum restaking protocols have recently surged, locking in nearly US$13 billion in total value and raising concerns about the potential risks they pose to the network\u2019s stability.\n\nAnalysts from Coinbase have highlighted the dangers associated with these protocols, which offer users additional rewards through liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) but also compound risks and incentivize higher risk behavior for greater yields.\n\nDespite these issues, restaking is anticipated to become integral to Ethereum\u2019s new services, providing significant incentives for validators.\n\nThe restaking process, especially through the Eigenlayer protocol, allows users to stake derivative tokens and earn LRTs, which can be restaked for more rewards. This practice can result in funds being repeatedly allocated to similar validators, increasing both yield and risk. The market\u2019s enthusiasm for restaking has sparked debate, with Ethereum developers cautioning against the potential for excessive leverage.\n\nProtocols like Etherfi, Renzo, Kelp, and Puffer have seen a surge in deposits, with Etherfi leading at over US$3.2 billion in total value locked.\n\nThe growth in TVL is largely due to users utilizing EigenLayer to keep access to their funds while enhancing the network\u2019s economic security.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s framework permits the deposit and restaking of ether from various liquid staking tokens, with the aim of securing third-party protocols.\n\nThe increase in TVL is driven by the capability to restake liquid-staking tokens on EigenLayer, which seeks to bolster the security of other networks such as rollups, oracles, and data availability platforms.\n\nAlthough the opportunity for direct restaking deposits on EigenLayer was temporarily available, LRT protocols continue to welcome ether deposits, restaking them on behalf of users and issuing derivative tokens."

        "content": "The SEC has opened comments on Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise\u2018s applications to launch spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe notices apply to proposed rule changes through which two exchanges \u2014 Cboe BZX and NYSE Arca \u2014 aim to list and trade shares of the three funds.\n\nComments are open for 21 days following publication in the federal register.\n\nThis phase is a routine procedure in the approval process for ETFs, mirroring the approach taken with spot Bitcoin ETF applications, which previously encouraged feedback from US citizens and organizations.\n\nMarket correlation\n\nEach notice discusses matters that are expected to influence the SEC when it comes time to approve or reject the proposed spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nMost importantly, the notices discuss correlations between ETH futures and ETH spot markets and whether the spot ETH market is of a significant size related to the futures ETH market. The correlation is relevant because the SEC has previously approved futures ETH ETFs.\n\nNYSE Arca and Grayscale cited an analysis by Coinbase that demonstrates the correlation and shows that fraud and manipulation are unlikely in the spot ETH market. The two companies also said that the Investment Company Act of 1940 does not offer relevant protections that should lead to the denial of certain spot crypto ETFs, contrary to the SEC\u2019s claims.\n\nCboe and Fidelity asserted that their proposal and analysis prove that the spot ETH market is of relevant size. NYSE Arca and Bitwise cited their analysis to that end.\n\nThe notices also seek comment on other issues such as custodianship of funds, creation and redemption models, and sponsor\u2019s fees. Requests for comments are routine and do not indicate whether a fund is likely to gain approval.\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nThe call for comments arrives after a history of postponed decisions by the SEC regarding spot Ethereum ETFs. The involvement of high-profile fund managers such as Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise emphasizes the significance and growing interest in cryptocurrency-based financial products among traditional investment firms.\n\nThis initiative by the three fund managers aims to establish a spot ETH ETF, enabling investors to purchase shares that reflect the price of Ethereum. Following the SEC\u2019s approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs in January, which have since seen substantial inflows and popularity, there is a strong push to secure similar regulatory green lights for Ethereum-based products.\n\nNotably, Coinbase held discussions with the SEC last week concerning Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETF proposition. Grayscale aims to transform its existing Ethereum Trust into a spot ETH ETF, a move that Coinbase publicly supported in a recent presentation to the regulator.\n\nThe push for Ethereum ETFs comes amid varying market sentiments. While the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a significant milestone, analysts remain divided on the prospects for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSome speculate that the SEC might delay its approval to create a temporal separation between Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Despite this, entities like Standard Chartered have expressed optimism, anticipating SEC approval by May.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A crypto strategist is issuing a warning on Ethereum, saying that ETH is now in the midst of a major correction.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Ali Martinez tells his 56,500 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is now bearish after breaking below support at $3,400.\n\nThe trader shares a chart suggesting that ETH may witness an over 14% decline from current levels after confirming a bear pennant breakdown.\n\n\u201cThe most brutal scenario for Ethereum right now is breaching the $3,400 support level. Such a move could confirm a bear pennant formation on the daily chart, potentially triggering a major correction for ETH down to $2,800.\u201d\n\nA bear pennant is a technical pattern indicating the continuation of downward price action.\n\nLooking at on-chain data, Martinez says that the $2,850 level may offer support for Ethereum as it is the price area where 1.99 million addresses collectively bought a total of 1.64 million ETH.\n\n\u201cEthereum dropping below $3,460 is a problem for the bulls! Given the lack of support, it increases the chances for a further ETH correction toward $2,850 or lower.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,284, down over 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), the trader says that the crypto king will likely see more downside moves if it starts trading below the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) on the four-hour chart.\n\n\u201cThe 200 EMA on the Bitcoin four-hour chart has been formidable support. Since early February, it has prevented BTC from dropping further.\n\nFor this reason, I\u2019m paying close attention to this level because if it holds, it guarantees a rebound, but if it breaks as it did in mid-January, it could lead to more losses for BTC.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $65,592 while the 200 EMA on the four-hour chart is hovering at $65,549.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH-USD) finds itself at a pivotal juncture, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) taking significant steps that could shape the future of cryptocurrency investments. The focus on Ethereum ETFs underscores the growing interest and potential for broader acceptance within the investment community.\n\nSEC Seeks Public Insight\n\nThe SEC has initiated a 21-day comment period for Ethereum ETF applications from industry heavyweights Grayscale, Fidelity, and Bitwise. Critical in the evaluation process, this step aims to gauge public sentiment and concerns regarding these proposed investment vehicles. The call for public comments is a procedural formality and a vital part of ensuring that the introduction of Ethereum ETFs aligns with investor interests and market integrity.\n\nWith the May 23 deadline for a final decision on VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application approaching, not many in the crypto space expect it to be approved. Recent SEC actions, including inquiries into the Ethereum Foundation, have cast a shadow of uncertainty over the immediate prospects of Ethereum ETFs. Analysts, while hopeful, prepare for the possibility of a delay beyond the May deadline.\n\nA Strategic Pause for Ethereum?\n\nDespite prevailing doubts about a timely approval, not all industry voices view potential delays as a setback. Matt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, presents an intriguing perspective, suggesting that a more gradual integration of Ethereum-based products could benefit the traditional finance (TradFi) sector. Allowing the market to acclimate to Bitcoin ETFs before introducing Ethereum offerings might pave the way for a smoother transition and broader acceptance.\n\nOn the trading front, Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics offer a mixed picture. The cryptocurrency has declined nearly 12% this week, yet it remains above the March lows near $3,050. Traders are closely monitoring the $2,850 support level, aware that regulatory developments could trigger significant market movements.\n\nDon\u2019t let crypto give you a run for your money.

        "title": "Why the Ethereum Community Is Up in Arms Against a Proposal to Change the Monetary Policy - Unchained",
        "content": "Ethereum researchers claim that a high staking ratio is bad for the network as well as for ETH as an asset. They\u2019re proposing a solution, but is it worth the cost?\n\nA significant discussion to reevaluate Ethereum\u2019s token issuance model has stirred debate over the future of ETH staking economics.\n\nAs Ethereum sees an upward trend in ETH staking, projections suggest this could lead to a majority of ETH being locked in staking contracts, prompting concerns over the network\u2019s future dynamics. In response, Ethereum Foundation researchers Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling have introduced a proposal to tweak Ethereum\u2019s issuance policy to maintain a balanced staking ratio, aiming to prevent potential negative effects such as inflationary pressures on non-stakers and centralization risks.\n\nHowever, this solution has sparked a contentious debate within the Ethereum community, with some members voicing strong opposition against altering the monetary policy in a way they believe could undermine Ethereum\u2019s foundational principles and its appeal to institutional investors.\n\nAs James Spediacci tweeted, \u201cIt almost seems like a coordinated attack on Ethereum that a few people are suggesting adjusting the ETH issuance curve again and changing the monetary policy when the SEC currently has Ethereum under a microscope.\u201d\n\nThe Amount of Staked ETH Has Been on the Rise\n\nSince Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake 18 months ago, known as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d the dynamics of ETH staking have shifted dramatically. Currently, about 31 million ETH, roughly 26% of the total supply, are staked. This figure has been on an upward trajectory, from 11% at the time of the Merge and 15% at the time of the Shapella upgrade, which enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH from the Beacon Chain in April 2023.\n\nThere are several drivers behind the progressive increase in staking, including the overall improvement in the network\u2019s security and stability, innovations like liquid staking providers that lower the barrier to entry for staking, and the enticement of additional rewards. Notably, these additional rewards include those from Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), as well as opportunities for airdrop farming, which add to the attractiveness of staking beyond the primary consensus layer rewards.\n\nStaking Demand Will Continue to Increase\n\nThe staking ratio is set to increase in the upcoming months and years, as highlighted in a blog post by Mike Neuder from the Ethereum Foundation, due to five reasons:\n\nAppreciating ETH Price: An increasing ETH price makes staking more attractive due to higher USD-denominated yields.\n\nRestaking Demand: Platforms like EigenLayer are driving interest in restaked ETH , with the potential for airdrops adding to the appeal.\n\nInterest Rates: Lower interest rates could shift institutional capital towards staking for better yields.\n\nLiquid Staking Tokens (LST)/Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT): These tokens lower the barrier to staking and are expected to attract significant capital inflows.\n\nStaked ETH ETFs: The possibility of Ethereum-based ETFs, which include staking in their model, could introduce a substantial new audience to staking.\n\nWhy a High Staking Ratio Might Be Bad\n\nHowever, the prospect of a continually increasing staking ratio raises several concerns.\n\n\u201cWe argue that high staking ratio regimes come with negative externalities that affect ETH holders, (solo) stakers, as well as the protocol itself,\u201d they wrote in the proposal.\n\nDietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling\u2019s analysis points out potential issues with nearly all ETH being staked, particularly with a significant portion being locked in LSTs such as Lido\u2019s stETH, Coinbase\u2019s cbETH, or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH. According to the authors, a scenario where the staking ratio approaches 100% is troubling for several reasons:\n\nReal staking yield will diminish: As the staking rate approaches 100%, real yields from staking could drop to zero. Although rewards from the protocol continue, the total supply of ETH increases at the same rate, effectively nullifying real gains for stakers.\n\nETH will become \u201cexpensive\u201d money: High staking rates could make holding ETH costly due to increased inflationary pressure on non-stakers. When lots of ETH is staked, people who don\u2019t stake see the amount of their ETH decrease proportionally compared to those who do stake. This could undermine ETH\u2019s role as a cost-effective and trustless asset on the Ethereum network.\n\nThreat to ETH\u2019s status as default currency: The expensive nature of holding ETH might challenge its position as the default currency of Ethereum, leading to friction in transactions and a shift towards alternative tokens or protocols. People might start using other tokens that give them rewards, like Lido\u2019s stETH, for daily use. This means ETH might not be the main currency people use on Ethereum anymore.\n\nRisk of centralization and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d entities: A few dominant staking tokens like Lido, which currently has 30% of all staked ETH, could amass excessive influence over Ethereum\u2019s underlying protocol, posing risks to the network\u2019s decentralization and governance. So, if there\u2019s a smart contract vulnerability in Lido\u2019s cost, and they represent the majority of the network, in theory, they could fork the chain to avoid their losses.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nTo mitigate these risks, on February 21, Ansgar and Caspar proposed a recalibration of Ethereum\u2019s issuance curve, which involves a shift towards Stake Ratio Targeting, a nuanced approach that aims for a balanced staking ratio instead of a fixed quantity of staked ETH.\n\nThe proposed change aims to decrease the incentive for new staking inflows by introducing a revised formula for calculating staking rewards. The current issuance curve, defined by a parameterized inverse square root function, doesn\u2019t cap rewards in a way that prevents an excessive total staking ratio.\n\nThe new formula intends to address this by adjusting rewards to discourage staking beyond a certain threshold, thus aiming to stabilize the staking ratio and ensure network security without inviting negative externalities. While the curve might not need to turn negative abruptly to be effective, a gradual approach towards zero rewards past a certain staking level could suffice to target a suitable staking range. For example, under the current issuance curve, at 80 million ETH staked, the nominal yield would be 2%, whereas under a possible revised curve, the same amount of ETH staked could yield 1%.\n\nNevertheless, the authors don\u2019t explicitly say what the ideal staking ratio should be. \u201cIt is inherently hard to objectively reason about it and needs to be discussed more broadly in the community,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDietrichs and Schwarz-Schilling\u2019s proposal, premised on the assumptions that most ETH will eventually be staked, predominantly through Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), is fundamentally about steering the network towards an inevitable future under controlled terms. They argue that as staking becomes increasingly prevalent, the staking rewards will naturally diminish under the current issuance curve.\n\nBy proposing a change in the issuance curve now, while the staking ratio is still relatively low, they aim to adjust the incentives in a way that preempts the potential negative outcomes of an excessively high staking ratio. This proactive approach seeks to maintain the balance and health of the Ethereum ecosystem by ensuring that the transition towards higher staking ratios does not compromise the network\u2019s security, dilute ETH holders unnecessarily, or disadvantage solo stakers.\n\nNegative Community Reaction\n\nWhile the Ethereum Foundation researchers intended to initiate a discussion, the community was up in arms, with the majority signaling that this was not a good idea for Ethereum to pursue.\n\nEric.eth, a co-author of one of Ethereum\u2019s most important improvement proposals (EIP-1559), is against changing the curve. \u201cSeeing some growing discussion from researchers and others in the community about tweaking the PoS issuance curve. The general disregard for how hard we\u2019ve worked for a decade establishing ETH being money is concerning. I\u2019ll fight this idea with anything I have,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nHis comments echo some critics who say that frequent changes in monetary policy erode confidence among users and investors, distancing Ethereum from the \u201chard money\u201d characteristic and \u201ccredible neutrality\u201d that underpin its value proposition, in contrast to the perceived stability of Bitcoin.\n\nGnosis co-founder Martin K\u00f6ppelmann pointed out that changing the issuance curve \u201cdoes not fundamentally improve Ethereum \u2013 it just shifts incentives from one group to another,\u201d while Jon Charbonneau, founder of DBA, said that \u201cthese tweaks try to solve an unsolvable problem of fundamental tradeoffs in PoS.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, altering the issuance curve could dilute Ethereum\u2019s attractiveness as a yield-generating asset for ETFs and institutional investors whose interest in Ethereum is based on its existing \u201cyield\u201d narrative. Similarly, projects built on Ethereum might suffer due to the shift in expectations around monetary policy stability.\n\nRegulatory Risks?\n\nAnother community member pointed out that, in the midst of the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the EF, this move is not smart, as it would imply that the Foundation indeed runs managerial efforts over Ethereum. This is significant because it is one of the prongs of the Howey Test, and the SEC could use it to argue that ETH is a security.\n\nI love and respect EF researchers. We would not be where we are without their precious work and they'll keep on being very valuable. But goddamnit, sometimes, they can't read the room! pic.twitter.com/Lcau6VWpAE \u2014 Jrag.eth (@JimmyRagosa) April 1, 2024\n\nDebate to Continue?\n\nResearcher Emmanuel Awoski criticized those who wouldn\u2019t even engage in a conversation about the issuance curve. He wrote, \u201cToday is a good day to start calling out the trend of anti-intellectualism that\u2019s slowly permeating the discourse around the issuance curve change. Not only are memes like this distasteful, they also represent how low we\u2019ve fallen as a community. Now, EF researchers are getting mocked by people who haven\u2019t spent their days/nights obsessing about solving hard problems. People whose sole contribution to crypto has been \u2018I\u2019ll pour money into some protocol and wait for the numbers to go up\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut negative sentiment has so far seemed to prevail. Ryan Berckmans countered saying that \u201cit\u2019s not anti intellectualism to point out (in meme form or otherwise) that for all its laudable technical rigor, the issuance modification proposal fails to demonstrate an understanding of basic key facets of the change management environment.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Monday, April 3, 04:15 pm ET: An earlier version of this article mistakenly displayed the name of Caspar Schwarz-Schilling as Caspar Schwarz. Unchained regrets the error."

        "content": "VanEck believes that Ethereum\u2018s Layer-2 protocols will hit a collective $1 trillion market capitalization by 2030, according to a new research report published on April 3.\n\nThe prediction was revealed in a detailed analysis led by VanEck senior investment analyst Patrick Bush and head of digital research Matthew Sigel.\n\nVanEck\u2019s forecast of a $1 trillion market cap for Ethereum Layer-2s by 2030 reflects a belief in the technology\u2019s potential to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, marking a notable shift in the landscape of digital assets and their underlying technologies.\n\nSolving scalability\n\nThe investment firm\u2019s analysis assessed the burgeoning Layer-2 ecosystem across several critical dimensions: transaction pricing, developer experience, user experience, trust assumptions, and ecosystem size.\n\nAccording to the report, Layer-2 technologies, specifically Optimistic Roll-Ups and Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups, are solving Ethereum\u2019s biggest challenge \u2014 scalability.\n\nThese solutions aim to expand Ethereum\u2019s capacity for transaction processing without compromising its core attributes of security and decentralization. The analysis points to the EIP-4844 upgrade as a key development, introducing \u201cBlob Space\u201d to reduce data posting costs significantly, thereby benefiting Layer-2 operations financially.\n\nAccording to the report, the cost reductions enabled by EIP-4844 are pivotal for improving Layer-2 profit margins.\n\nThe report also explored the revenue models of Layer-2 solutions, emphasizing transaction sequencing as a primary source of income. It examined both on-chain and off-chain cost structures, particularly noting the expensive proof mechanisms that Zero-Knowledge Roll-Ups employ.\n\nTVL\n\nIn evaluating the competitive landscape, the study predicts that by 2030, Layer-2s will capture a significant portion of transaction value and Total Value Locked (TVL) within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis growth is partly attributed to the potential of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to augment Layer-2 revenues. VanEck\u2019s analysis suggests a future where Layer-2 platforms may offer competitive advantages over Ethereum in specific market segments.\n\nHowever, the report maintains a neutral tone regarding the speculative nature of the crypto market and the uncertain future of Layer-2 token valuations. It anticipates the emergence of numerous use-case-specific Layer-2 roll-ups, indicating a broader application of blockchain technology beyond finance to sectors like gaming, social media, and infrastructure.\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis presents a compelling vision of the future, one where Ethereum Layer-2s evolve from nascent technologies to central cogs in the global blockchain ecosystem."

        "content": "Ripple aims to tap into the growth potential and niche opportunities within the stablecoin market.\n\nShare this article\n\nRipple plans to issue a stablecoin tied to the US dollar, which will be 100% backed by USD deposits, short-term US bonds, and other cash equivalents. Expected to debut later this year, Ripple\u2019s stablecoin will be deployed on the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain, with plans to extend to other blockchains and DeFi platforms, Ripple said on its website.\n\nTo ensure transparency and address potential concerns about reserve quality, Ripple will publish monthly attestations of its stablecoin reserves. Additionally, these reserves will be audited by a reputable third-party accounting firm. Specific details regarding the chosen firm have not yet been disclosed.\n\nBrad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO, explained that the launch is to address the growing demand for stablecoin with a compliant and trusted solution and drive development and use cases within the XRPL ecosystem.\n\n\u201cInstitutions entering this space are finding success by partnering with compliant, crypto-native players and Ripple\u2019s track record and resiliency speaks for itself, as we launch new products and acquire companies through multiple market cycles. This move is also monumental for the XRP Ledger community, driving more use cases, liquidity and opportunities for developers and users,\u201d said Garlinghouse.\n\nRipple claims its stablecoin offers a unique combination of features tailored for enterprise use, regulatory compliance, and a thriving developer ecosystem. The firm seeks to fill a gap in the market for institutions seeking stablecoin integration for large-scale payments.\n\nA lucrative market\n\nStablecoins are an integral part of the crypto ecosystem. According to data from the Federal Reserves, over 80% of trading volume on major centralized crypto exchanges in 2022 involved stablecoins. This popularity can be attributed to their role as a frictionless on-chain intermediary. Unlike converting to traditional fiat currency, stablecoins allow traders to quickly move between positions without leaving the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWith a value of around $150 billion, Ripple CTO David Schwartz expects the stablecoin market to reach over $2 trillion by 2028. Currently, the market is dominated by Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC. However, Schwartz sees opportunities for niche players to carve out their space.\n\n\u201cWe think it will be over $2 trillion by 2028, and there\u2019s only two market leaders. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner-take-all-all ecosystem, particularly on the DeFi side,\u201d said Schwartz.\n\nThe stablecoin market is not just sizable, it\u2019s highly profitable. Leading stablecoin issuer Tether recently reported a nearly $3 billion in quarterly profits last year, with $1 billion coming from US bonds. Last month, Tether hit a $100 billion market cap; this level of growth puts Tether in the same league as established giants like British oil and gas giant BP and Shopify in terms of market capitalization."

        "content": "A major black swan event for Ethereum (ETH-USD) and the broader cryptocurrency market, sometimes referred to as ETHgate, may be coming up. Steven Nerayoff, a former ETH advisor turned whistleblower, hints at groundbreaking disclosures set to be released sometime today (April 3, 2024).\n\nUnderstanding ETHgate\n\nETHgate centers around allegations from Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, who claims to reveal fraud and corruption from the project\u2019s inception, particularly focusing on preferential regulatory treatment. The controversy gained traction after Nerayoff released a recording from 2015 featuring a conversation with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, in which he suggested a drastic restructuring of Ethereum\u2019s leadership and financial practices.\n\nDespite his allegations suggesting serious legal and ethical breaches within Ethereum, including comparisons to major financial scandals, the evidence has yet to substantiate these claims fully. Critics point to Nerayoff\u2019s history, including a charge of criminal extortion in 2019, to question his motives.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s sweeping allegations accuse Ethereum luminaries, such as Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin, of orchestrating extensive fraud, intellectual property theft, and conspiracy with U.S. officials. Further deepening the intrigue are claims of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) involvement in Ethereum and implicating the Ethereum Foundation in the 2016 Gatecoin hack.\n\nImminent Revelations about Widespread Corruption\n\nFast-forward to today, and his recent post on X teases imminent revelations about widespread corruption. He suggests that despite attempts by powerful entities to suppress their findings by targeting him, they have uncovered far-reaching malfeasance. He indicates that these disclosures, starting today, will fundamentally alter historical perceptions and change the crypto world as we know it.\n\nDon\u2019t let crypto give you a run for your money.

        "content": "Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it.\n\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen over $84 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. As ETH price cools off, several interesting factors are playing out within its ecosystem:\n\nEthereum's price has been consolidating on Wednesday following its recent crash. The recent price movement follows Coinbase analysts raising concerns about \"hidden risks\" in restaking protocols and criticism labeled at the Ethereum Foundation after an article recommending adjustments to the ETH issuance curve.\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecast: Can ETH Still Hit $4,000 Pre-Bitcoin Halving? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto market is gradually flipping bullish after a dismal start on Monday characterized by drastic losses after major altcoins tumbled. ETH, the token powering the most prominent smart contracts ecosystem, dropped to test $3,200 support, contributing to the generally bearish crypto market. Considering the current Ethereum price forecast, as it dodders at $33,379, the path of least resistance is gradually flipping upwards, aiming for highs above $4,000.\n\nBulls Wake Up In Tandem With The Soaring DeFi TVL\n\nThe volatility experienced by Ethereum has not significantly affected the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector within the ecosystem. A minor dip from the yearly high of approximately $58 billion eased to $47 billion, hinting at positive sentiment in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to data graphically highlighted by Defi Llama, the total value locked (TVL) in the sector has recovered to slightly above $50 billion, underscoring growing interest in the long-term fundamental outlook.\n\nOften investors prefer to participate in securing the network while in the process earning more coins instead of selling at the earliest sign of profit. Should the value of ETH locked in smart contracts continue to surge, it would be prudent to look forward to further price increases this week and this month in general.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Assessing Mid-Week Bullish Comeback\n\nEthereum price is slowly making its way to the $3,500 barrier, but first, it must confirm the validity of the support provided by the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $3,364.\n\nBacking the ongoing bullish push is a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. Buying pressure is bound to surge behind the token as the MACD rises into the positive region. The forming green histograms also validate the bullish thesis.\n\nConservative traders are likely to wait until Ethereum price tops the yellow band and the descending trendline resistance \u2013 marking the second confirmation of the uptrend.\n\nWith Bitcoin halving on the immediate horizon, interest in major altcoins could start to increase exponentially. Although the event is pertinent to BTC, the bullish sentiment associated with it tends to prop the entire crypto market to rally, with some tokens hitting new all-time highs.\n\nHowever, the IOMAP by IntoTheBlock realistically places a realistic resistance at $3,435 where 1.85 million addresses purchased 4.17 million ETH. Before rising above this level, some holders may choose to offload at their respective break-even points, thus creating selling pressure.\n\nOn the bright side, breaking above this hurdle could drastically change the technical outlook propping Ethereum for a bigger breakout ahead of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nDeclines could intensify if Ethereum price respects the seller congestion at $3,450, and possibly trigger a sell-off back to $3,200 and $3,000. If investors sell around the halving, it would be too early to rule out losses as far as $2,930.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "The US government has been observed transferring $40 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Thursday, April 4. This crypto reserve was seized from two Estonian citizens back in 2022. This move comes amidst a turbulent period for the leading cryptocurrency as the Bitcoin price just managed to rebound above $67,000.\n\nUS Gov Makes Massive Bitcoin & Ethereum Transfer\n\nThe seized Bitcoin and Ethereum, now in the possession of US authorities, holds the potential to impact the crypto market dynamics significantly. According to Arkham Intelligence, the US government made two subsequent transfers today for BTC and ETH, respectively. The first transfer was of 4,567 ETH worth $15.21 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition, the authorities transferred 374 BTC worth $24.80 million to an unknown wallet. With the market eagerly watching the US government\u2019s next steps, speculation is rife regarding the potential impact on the Bitcoin and Ethereum price.\n\nIt is estimated that the eventual sale of the seized crypto reserve by the US government could exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin and Ethereum price. The influx of such a substantial amount of Bitcoin into the market may trigger selling pressure, expediting the current dip in prices.\n\nEarlier, late Tuesday morning, a wallet associated with the US government transferred a massive 30,175 Bitcoin. Considering the Bitcoin price of around $65,000 at the time, this transaction amounts to approximately worth $2 billion.\n\nThe last confirmed instance of the government selling Bitcoin dates back to March 2023. During this event, they sold 9,861 coins for $216 million. This sale followed the government\u2019s seizure of around 50,000 Bitcoin linked to the Silk Road website in late 2022.\n\nAmong the recent transfers, approximately 2,000 Bitcoin were sent to a wallet identified by Arkham Intelligence as belonging to the crypto exchange Coinbase. The remaining Bitcoin was transferred to a wallet flagged by Arkham as being owned by the government.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Short-Term Investors Lose $5.2B Amid BTC Price Crash\n\nBTC & ETH Price Rebound\n\nAfter plummeting over 11% from the recent high of $73,750.07, Bitcoin has recovered significantly. As of writing, BTC price was $67,534.94, gaining 2.58%. Meanwhile, the market cap for BTC stood at $1.32 billion. In contrast, the trading volume plunged 20.20% to $30.11 billion.\n\nHowever, if the recent US government Bitcoin and Ethereum transfer is made for a selloff, the rebound could be short-lived. In addition, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe predicted that the Bitcoin consolidation will continue and there\u2019s not much upside as of now. On the contrary, he expects a surge in altcoin prices, which could benefit Ethereum despite the potential selloff.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price was up by 1.35% to $3,374.15 with a market cap of $404.99 billion. Whilst, the trading volume for Ethereum slumped 24.82% to $13.12 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2s May Outshine Main Blockchain, VanEck Reports\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

Currently, there are 46 Ethereum layer 2 networks with a total value locked of $38.97 billion, with Arbitrum being the largest at $18 billion.\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s dominance in smart contracts, scalability remains a hurdle, leading to high fees during peak usage.

However, they express caution about the long-term value of most layer 2 tokens due to intense competition.\n\nVan Eck predicts a future with thousands of specialized layer 2 networks alongside a few major general-purpose chains, driven by the network effect.

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Halving Lead to $100,000? Ethereum (ETH) on Verge of Reversal, Mysterious Solana Price Performance - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin's next halving event is the main fuel for the discussion about its future price, with most people anticipating $100,000.\n\nThe chart shows Bitcoin is currently experiencing fluctuations. If we follow past patterns, Bitcoin might show strong growth after the halving. But, it is also possible that this growth will not be as great as before, considering the market's capitalization and the presence of institutional funds.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin is trading around $65,493. It is important to look at the support level at $63,600. This is like a safety net \u2013 if the price does not fall below this, Bitcoin could start the bullish reversal again. The next support level is down at $47,474, which could come into play if the price drops further.\n\nFor Bitcoin's price to reach $100,000, it would need to break past several resistance levels. The first big challenge is around $68,000. If it can stay above this, Bitcoin may continue to rise and possibly reach new highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean for the future? After the halving, Bitcoin could go up in price, maybe even reaching $100,000. However, it might not happen quickly or as strongly as some people hope. It is important to remember that other factors can influence Bitcoin's price and that previous price performance is not a guarantee of a bullish future.\n\nWill Ethereum reverse?\n\nEthereum is showing signs that it might be about to change its direction after a period of falling prices. The chart indicates that Ethereum is now close to the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. This could be a sign that a reversal, where the price starts to go up again, might happen soon.\n\nWhen we look at the specific numbers on the chart, the 50 EMA is right near the price level of $3,300. If Ethereum's price can stay above this line, it is a good hint that the price could start rising. On the other hand, if the price falls below 50 EMA, it could be the continuation of a descending price trend.\n\nRight now, Ethereum's price is hovering around $3,324.9. The next big resistance level is at $3,500. If the price of Ethereum can go past this point, it could be the start of a climb back up to even higher levels.\n\nIn general, the market is doing okay, so there might not be too much to worry about right now despite the correction we are seeing. However, Ethereum's growth factors for now are mostly layer 2s and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF, which will most likely be the only major capital injection Ether will see during this market cycle.\n\nSolana's weird behavior\n\nSolana's price moves have been quite mysterious lately. After breaking out of a pattern known as a symmetrical triangle, which often leads to a price rally, we saw a few days of gains. But then, surprisingly, the price did not enter a bull trend. Instead, we saw a bearish reversal, where the price started to fall again, which was not the most expected show out there.\n\nOn the chart, Solana's price had risen above the triangle formation, reaching up to about $210. However, instead of continuing upward, it faced resistance and could not maintain the momentum. The price has fallen back to around $180.59, leaving many traders with losses and a lot of questions.\n\nLooking closer, we can identify the key support level at $148.48, which is a price that could potentially stop further drops and help turn things around. If the price falls below this level, the next support is way down at $129.67, showing that there is quite a bit of room for a potential downside.\n\nOn the other hand, if Solana's price can find some strength and start to go up again, the key resistance level to watch is around $213 \u2013 a price from the previous breakthrough."

        "title": "Ethereum - Modification of monetary policy underway - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Thu 04 Apr 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Nicolas T.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation once again wants to change Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy. The reason behind this is the growing number of validators\u2026\n\nMonetary Policy Change during the Electra Fork?\n\nIn response to Vitalik\u2019s proposal to establish a maximum limit on the number of validators, Mike Neuder is advocating for a reduction in the issuance of new Ether awarded to validators instead.\n\n\u201cWe believe that modifying the reward issuance curve should be seriously considered for the Electra fork,\u201d declared a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation in an article published on March 30th.\n\nSome are already opposing it, arguing that such changes to Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy would undermine trust in the Ethereum network.\n\nEric.eth, co-author of a significant Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559, about transaction fee calculation), stated:\n\n\u201cI see more and more researchers considering changing the pace of ETH issuance. The general contempt for the efforts we\u2019ve put in over a decade to make ETH a currency is disturbing. I will fight this idea with all my strength.\u201d\n\nSeeing some growing discussion from researchers and others in the community about tweaking the PoS issuance curve.\n\n\n\nThe general disregard for how hard we've worked for a decade establishing ETH being money is concerning.\n\n\n\nI'll fight this idea with anything I have. \u2014 eric.eth (@econoar) March 30, 2024\n\nHis comments echo those who believe that frequent changes to monetary policy erode the confidence of users and investors. For them, such instability does not align with Ethereum\u2019s slogan of \u201cUltra Sound Money.\u201d\n\nIn this context, don\u2019t miss our article comparing the issuance rates of ETH and bitcoins: Bitcoin vs Ethereum. We wrote in it:\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s monetary supply depends on two parameters. ETH is created via rewards paid to validators. The more validators there are, the faster the quantity of ETH increases. This system is called \u2018staking.\u2019\n\nThe monetary creation is more or less offset by the destruction of a part of the transaction fees (\u2018burn\u2019). The increase in the number of transactions causes an exponential increase in transaction fees, and thus the number of ETH destroyed.\u201d\n\nFrom PoW to PoS\n\nBlock rewards have decreased several times throughout Ethereum\u2019s history. They were at 5 ETH at its launch in 2015. They fell to 3 ETH following the Byzantium fork in 2017. And then to 2 ETH from 2019 onwards.\n\nEverything changed with the transition to Proof of Stake in 2022. Rewards are now issued at a rate of 166 times the square root of the sum of ETH staked. This formula means that the pace of new ETH creation increases as staking increases.\n\nSamuel Haig explains in this article that one million ETH staked generates rewards of 166,000 ETH per year. If 100 million ETH are staked, the annual issuance rises to 1.66 million ETH.\n\nCurrently, roughly 31 million ETH have been staked, amounting to about 26% of all ETH in circulation. However, for Mike Neuder, another researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, staking is expected to increase further in the coming years.\n\nKnowing that ETH staked are ETH that are no longer in circulation. It\u2019s that much ETH that will no longer generate transaction fees. In other words, the increase in the number of validators triggers a vicious cycle:\n\nIncreased ETH awarded to validators and reduced ETH \u2018burn\u2019.\n\nIt looks quite like the concept of Proof of Stake is turning into a fiasco\u2026\n\nThe Problems with a Growing Number of Validators\n\nFor developers @adietrichs and @casparschwa, the turn of events is concerning for several reasons:\n\n-Decrease in the actual yield of staking: \u201cThe actual yields tend to zero as the staking nears 100% of ETH in circulation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if everyone stakes their ETH, no one gains. The rewards are negated by the inflationary effect.\n\n-Expropriation of users: \u201cStaking close to 100% would greatly increase the inflationary pressure on users,\u201d.\n\nAnd naturally so. The more validators receiving more ETH, the higher the inflation. These newly issued ETH dilute the value of the common user\u2019s ETH.\n\n-Centralization: \u201cSeveral staking tokens like Lido (which currently holds 30% of all staked ETH) could exert excessive influence over the Ethereum protocol. This poses risks to the network\u2019s decentralization and governance,\u201d.\n\nIn summary, now that Staking is no longer the exclusive preserve of a minority of profiteers, the rules change\u2026 It is now necessary to reduce the incentive to become a validator. The idea is that rewards should trend towards zero beyond a certain level of staking.\n\nThe yield is currently 2.65% per year for validators. At 80 million ETH staked, this yield would drop to 2%. It would only be 1% with the new formula that some Ethereum Foundation researchers propose.\n\nThus, eighteen months after The Merge, we find out that Ethereum, not having any real utility, will have more and more validators and fewer and fewer transactions.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Conversely, surpassing the $68,000 threshold could pave the way for Bitcoin to target the $71,000 resistance zone,\" Edul added.Meanwhile, CoinDCX Research Team, said, \"In the past 24 hours, the crypto market experienced a downturn without a clear catalyst. Factors such as BTC ETF outflows and a large transfer of seized BTC by the US government contributed to the decline.\"The global cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.36% to around $2.5 trillion in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently $12.06 billion, 9.66% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

        "title": "ETH/USD: Navigating The Volatile World Of Ethereum Trading - FinanceFeeds",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency,the ETH/USD trading pair stands as a critical indicator of market trends and investor sentiment towards Ethereum, the blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality and as the birthplace of decentralized applications (dApps). Trading Ethereum against the US dollar, the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, provides a fascinating glimpse into the interplay between digital innovation and traditional financial systems, reflecting broader economic trends and the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has experienced significant price fluctuations since its inception, driven by factors such as technological advancements, regulatory changes, and shifts in investor sentiment. These dynamics make the ETH/USD pair a focal point for traders and investors seeking to capitalize on the volatility of the crypto market. Understanding the factors that influence the value of Ether in relation to the US dollar is crucial for anyone looking to engage in trading or investing in Ethereum.\n\nThe value of ETH in USD terms is influenced by several key factors. Technological developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as upgrades to the platform\u2019s scalability and efficiency, can have a significant impact on Ether\u2019s price. For instance, the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve the network\u2019s scalability through the introduction of proof-of-stake consensus, has been closely watched by the market for its potential to enhance Ethereum\u2019s utility and, consequently, the value of ETH.\n\nRegulatory news also plays a pivotal role in the ETH/USD price dynamics. Announcements regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in major economies can lead to significant price movements, as investors adjust their expectations based on the potential for increased adoption or regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, influenced by factors such as Bitcoin\u2019s performance and broader economic indicators, can lead to fluctuations in the ETH/USD trading pair.\n\nFor traders and investors, keeping a close eye on these factors is essential for making informed decisions. Many turn to technical analysis, using charts and historical data to identify trends and predict future movements in the ETH/USD pair. Additionally, fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology and its adoption across different sectors, can provide insights into the long-term prospects of ETH.\n\nDespite the opportunities, trading ETH/USD comes with risks. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with prices capable of making dramatic swings in a short period. This environment requires a well-thought-out strategy, risk management techniques, and, importantly, an understanding that not all movements can be predicted.\n\nIn conclusion, the ETH/USD trading pair offers a window into the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, reflecting the ongoing evolution of Ethereum and its interaction with traditional financial systems. For those interested in the future of finance and technology, keeping an eye on the ETH/USD pair can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the digital currency space. As Ethereum continues to develop and find new applications, the ETH/USD pair will undoubtedly remain a key barometer of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s health and investor sentiment."

While this may signify indecisiveness among bulls and bears, its Q1 results show steady growth across various sectors even as community members debate on its commodity status.\n\nRead more: Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh\n\nDaily digest market movers: L2s, Q1 earnings, ETH commodity status\n\nEthereum has been one of the most trending cryptocurrencies in the past few weeks. Despite expectations that anticipation for Bitcoin's halving would be the main subject of discussion, the SEC's decision on Ethereum ETFs and the recent crackdown on Ethereum Foundation appears to have taken center stage in the crypto community. That said, here's a quick breakdown of the latest happenings surrounding the largest altcoin:\n\nIn a report released on Wednesday, global asset manager VanEck analysts expect Ethereum Layer 2 networks to accrue more revenue than its main chain. They sighted data from crypto analysis firm Artemis XYZ, showing the increasing growth of the underlying Ethereum ecosystem against its Mainnet declining market share. L2s offer superior throughput and user experience, especially with the Dencun upgrade on March 13, which introduced Blob space \u2013 a data layer for L2 that reduces data overhead and gas fees \u2013 noted VanEck analysts.\n\nThe analysts further predicted that Ethereum L2s may be worth more than $1 trillion by 2030, considering several application, sector, or function-specific Layer 2s may emerge \u2013 like an asset management L2 or rollups that host a social media sector. They noted that these L2s reinforce \"the value of ETH as the true \u2018oil\u2019 powering the entire ecosystem of connected chains.\u201d\n\nEthereum's Q1 financial report, released on Wednesday by Coin98 Analytics, showed significant growth in revenue and earnings. Ethereum's revenue grew nearly 84.6% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to reach $1.035 billion, and earnings reached $369.11 million, a 198.8% QoQ change. Much of this increase is attributed to the spike in gas fees before the Dencun upgrade. Other metrics from the report include 107 million transactions conducted with 9.7 million new addresses in Q1.\n\nFollowing ETH Q1 results was Cory Klippsten, CEO of Bitcoin financial service firm Swan.com, arguing in an X post on Wednesday that Ethereum was a security when it launched. He claimed the SEC didn't want to get in the way of another agency when it allowed the CME to start trading ETH futures ETF.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who was tagged in the post, responded by stating that the ETH futures ETF was registered as \"commodities futures, not securities futures.\"\n\nIf the SEC wanted to come out and call Eth a security, they should not have approved the listing of #Ethereum futures ETFs which rely on these contracts. To go back and change that would likely mean the delisting and closing of CME ETH futures AND the ETH futures ETFs. Thus why\u2026 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) April 3, 2024\n\nJames Seyffart also said in another X post that the SEC asking for public comments on spot Ethereum ETF filings is a normal procedure and \"not \u2018bullish\u2019 in any capacity for Ethereum ETFs.\"\n\nAlso read: Ethereum drops further as Bitcoin\u2019s decline, uncertainty over ETF weigh\n\nTechnical analysis: Indecisiveness persists\n\nTraders are exercising more caution as Ethereum's price continues its horizontal move for a second consecutive day. This indicates reduced bullish sentiments for the largest altcoin.\n\nETH/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nRead more: Ethereum consolidates above $3,500 as Bitwise CIO says ETF delay would be positive\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price shows signs of recovery, ETH could resume an upward move to break past the $3,493 level, which is the high from April 2. . Further up, next resistances are at $3,517, $3,570, and $3,655, which also align with recent swing highs seen in the past few days.\n\nHowever, this thesis would be invalidated if ETH moves below the $3,204 support level, the low from April 2.\n\nThe SEC's decision on the May 23 deadline to respond to VanEck spot Ethereum ETF filings is expected to have a major effect on prices."

        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to Ethereum and now better known als \u201cETH insider or whistleblower\u201d, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to announce that the long wait for his potentially massive revelations is finally over tomorrow. Nerayoff, who has been at the center of various controversies and legal battles, made a dramatic statement on X, suggesting the unveiling of information that could potentially alter the public\u2019s perception of the ETH ecosystem and its founders.\n\nNerayoff stated, \u201cTHE TIME HAS COME FOR THE EARTH-SHATTERING REVELATIONS OF FORMERLY UNTOUCHABLE POWERS: [\u2026] The most powerful forces on the planet sought to suppress us by maliciously targeting me, thinking it would silence us all. Despite their extreme power and vast resources, we emerged victorious [\u2026] The world is about to learn what we\u2019ve pieced together starting tomorrow. Get ready: The perception of yesterday will be drastically altered. The world as we know it is about to change.\u201d\n\nTHE TIME HAS COME FOR THE EARTH-SHATTERING REVELATIONS OF FORMERLY UNTOUCHABLE POWERS: The battle has been long, but it's a testament to how far we have come from where we started. The most powerful forces on the planet sought to suppress us by maliciously targeting me, thinking\u2026 pic.twitter.com/CvGkzkFhFg \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) April 3, 2024\n\nThe Ethereum Insider\u2019s Big Reveal: What To Expect\n\nNerayoff has made several serious allegations against Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin, and the Ethereum Foundation, painting a complex picture of supposed misconduct and fraud within the ETH ecosystem. These allegations span various aspects of Ethereum\u2019s development and operations, including fraudulent ICOs, personal misconduct, and collusion with corrupt officials.\n\nMisconduct and Fraud Allegations: Nerayoff accuses Buterin and Lubin of orchestrating a wide-ranging fraud within Ethereum, alleging their involvement in issuing fraudulent ICOs to fleece investors. He claims this activity was the main business model for Lubin\u2019s company, ConsenSys, early on. Nerayoff asserts that the fraudulent activities surrounding ETH are far more significant than those in the FTX case, referring to Ethereum as \u201cthe fraudulent elephant in the room.\u201d\u200b\n\nIntellectual Property and Inventions Theft: Nerayoff claims that Buterin copied his ideas, including the concept of issuing utility tokens via ICOs. He argues that Buterin has not contributed any significant inventions to the network and attributes the network\u2019s failure to scale to Buterin\u2019s actions\u200b\u200b.\n\nAccusations of Collusion with US Officials: Furthermore, Nerayoff alleges that Buterin and Lubin colluded with corrupt US government officials, including SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and former SEC Chairperson Jay Clayton. He implies that these relationships aka \u201cETH Gate\u201d gave ETH an unfair advantage in the crypto space\u200b.\n\nCharacter Assassination and Reputation Damage: Nerayoff also accuses Buterin and his father of attempting to ruin his reputation by falsely accusing him of extorting an Ethereum ICO. This claim extends to suggesting that ETH\u2019s founders have previously tried to frame him\u200b \u200b.\n\nCCP Involvement: According to Nerayoff, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) holds a substantial stake in Ethereum, which he and TruthLabs claim jeopardizes the entire cryptocurrency world. TruthLabs suggest that Chinese entities close to the CCP control nearly 80% of mined ETH, raising alarms about the potential for centralized control over the Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum Foundation\u2019s Connection to the Gatecoin Hack: TruthLabs and Steven Nerayoff have presented evidence suggesting the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s connection to the 2016 Gatecoin hack, where 185,000 ETH were stolen. This investigation highlighted transactions from the foundation to wallets directly involved in the hack, raising serious questions about the Foundation\u2019s role and motivations during this period.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these allegations are part of an ongoing dispute and have not been substantiated with concrete evidence in the public domain thus far. The situation is complex, with Nerayoff positioning himself as a whistleblower intent on exposing what he perceives as deep-rooted issues within the Ethereum ecosystem. Tomorrow the world will find out what Nerayoff can really prove.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,309.\n\nFeatured image from YouTube, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Ripple to Launch USD-Backed Stablecoin on Ethereum and XRP Ledger - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFintech firm Ripple announced Thursday that it plans to launch its own stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar across the Ethereum and XRP Ledger blockchains.\n\nSet to roll out later this year, an as-yet-unnamed crypto stablecoin will be fully backed by U.S. dollars, short-term U.S. government treasuries, and \u201cother cash equivalents,\u201d according to a release. Ripple says it will provide monthly attestations of its holdings that back the stablecoin, which will be audited by a third-party accounting firm.\n\nRipple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz told Decrypt that the firm believes the current $150 billion stablecoin market is poised to explode in the coming years to become a multi-trillion-dollar market. They see a clear opportunity in that space.\n\n\u201cWe think we're uniquely positioned to have a competitive entry in that market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have our presence both on the institutional side with our payments product, and on the XRP Ledger side, we have some entry into the DeFi section of the space. Those are kind of the two big buckets in which stablecoins are being used today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a space currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USDC, both of which Ripple\u2014the XRP-powered crypto payments platform and enterprise blockchain provider\u2014has been watching closely for years.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong balance sheet. We\u2019ve been around for a very long time,\u201d Schwartz explained. \u201cWe have fantastic compliance\u2014we've been doing compliance for payments for almost eight years now. We have an impressive suite of licenses.\u201d\n\nSchwartz said that Ripple decided that there \u201chas to be a U.S. jurisdictional nexus\u201d around its stablecoin and added that the \u201ceasier thing to do would be kind of like what Tether did.\u201d Tether is based in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBut Ripple hopes to see a day when U.S. customers can \u201cdeposit a stablecoin at your bank,\u201d and merge the enterprise and retail use cases with the traditional finance sphere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy launch a stablecoin now? Schwartz said the idea had been tossed around at Ripple for some time, jokingly at first. He recalled conversations like, \u201dIt would make our life easier. It's a license to print money, you know\u2014but not seriously.\u201d\n\nBut the more they simmered on the idea, he told Decrypt, the more it really made sense. Some of the reasons included demand from emerging markets that may not have great access to dollarized assets, and interest from enterprise firms in stablecoin adoption. Schwartz said that Ripple has been speaking with customers that don\u2019t use existing stablecoins, and asking why that is.\n\nHe added that there \u201caren\u2019t a lot of great stablecoins on the XRP Ledger,\u201d and as Ripple supports expanding use cases on the chain\u2014such as an automated market maker (AMM) feature on the horizon\u2014Schwartz said that there was a need for another prominent asset on the chain besides XRP itself.\n\n\u201cYou can't make a market between one asset, right?\u201d he said. \u201cThe more great assets, the more compelling the trading.\u201d\n\nRipple\u2019s upcoming stablecoin will debut across Ethereum and XRP Ledger, but the firm expects to expand it to additional blockchains over time as it sees demand and use cases. In fact, Schwartz said part of why it\u2019s being announced well before the expected rollout is so that Ripple can survey engagement and see where potential next opportunities are.\n\n\u201cWe have some ideas of where we think we're going to be successful, and what's going to be our next direction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut obviously, it's going to be very subject to adjustment based on how this resonates in the market.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "RWA is still in the early stages, but the BlackRock move could increase momentum.\n\nSecuritize founder believes that mainstream adoption is feasible if RWA hit $1 trillion mark.\n\nCarlos Domingo, Securitize\u2019s founder and CEO, has reiterated that tokenized real-world assets (RWA) will gain momentum if they reach the $1 trillion milestone.\n\nDomingo, whose firm handles BlackRock\u2019s tokenized BUIDL Fund tokens redemptions and placement, emphasized that;\n\n\u201cFor tokenized real-world assets, I think we\u2019re in the early stages\u2014like what crypto was before. Even if you add stablecoins, we\u2019re still not at the $200B/$300B mark.\u201d\n\nHe added,\n\n\n\n\u201cAs an industry, I think once we hit the $1 trillion mark of real-world assets on-chain, that\u2019s when this becomes an important part of capital markets and financial services.\u201d\n\nHowever, the RWA segment could hit the $1 trillion milestone in the next 2-5 years. Especially as momentum picks up after BlackRock\u2019s foray with its Ethereum [ETH]-based BUIDL Fund.\n\n\n\nBeyond BUIDL Fund and tokenized US treasuries\n\nAfter its impact on spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, market watchers have keenly tracked BlackRock\u2019s digital asset strategy.\n\nThe move into tokenized real-world assets (RWA) through its Ethereum-based BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity) Fund has heated up tokenized US treasuries.\n\n\n\nThe overall tokenized US treasuries hit the $1 billion mark shortly after BUIDL\u2019s debut, per Dune Analytics data.\n\nAccording to Domingo, with stablecoins\u2019 total market cap of around $152 billion, adding $1 billion of tokenized US treasuries still makes the RWA less attractive to some players.\n\nHowever, Domingo highlighted that credit will be the next target in the tokenization pipeline after US treasuries and securities.\n\n\n\n\u201cTokenized cash is number one. Then, tokenized treasuries and money market funds. But, then credit is the next one with less liquidity but higher yield.\u201d\n\nOndo Finance echoed a similar sentiment, noting that tokenizing a fraction of the US money market fund can tip the RWA sector to surpass even the BTC market cap.\n\nCiting a recent Cumberland report, Ondo highlighted,\n\n\u201cMoney market fund AUM at the beginning of 2023 was around $8.4T\u201d and if 1.5% of that issuance were to move on-chain, it would be larger than the current market cap of stablecoins. If 7.5% of it moved on-chain, it would be larger than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nTo put it differently, tokenizing about 10% of money market fund AUM (assets under management) is enough to rival BTC.\n\nIf BlackRock\u2019s RWA move through BUIDL Fund attracts more players, the $1 trillion mark could be fast-tracked."

        "content": "US SEC seeks comments on ETH ETF applications for Grayscale, Bitwise and Bitwise.\n\nAnalyst maintains low odds of May approval, calls the comments \u201cstandard procedure.\u201d\n\nOn the 3rd of April 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened a public comments period for Ethereum [ETH] ETF filing amendments tied to Bitwise, Fidelity and Grayscale.\n\nThe public comment period will run for 21 days. This development has excited some crypto users, who term the development a \u201cgiga bullish\u201d scenario for ETH.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the industry analysts has poured cold water on it. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, called the public comment window \u201cstandard procedure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAsking for public comments on a 19b-4 is standard procedure. Every single 19b-4 ETF filing goes through the same process (whether approved or denied). It\u2019s not \u201cbullish\u201d in any capacity for Ethereum ETFs.\u201d\n\nETH ETF: May approval dilemma\n\nAsked whether BlackRock will be able to pull approval for its spot in Ethereum ETF, Seyffart said,\n\n\n\n\u201cGood question. I\u2019d assume they wouldn\u2019t withdraw, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past Larry to pull a rabbit out of a hat, either. Haha. We are low odds\u2014but not zero for a reason.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outright dilemma for May approval.\n\nHowever, Sam Enzer, partner at Cahill Gordon and Reindel, claims that the SEC could reject approval in May due to the risk of market manipulation.\n\n\u201cI think the SEC, at least in the first instance, will deny or reject the applications. I think they\u2019ll rely on similar arguments that there is a risk of market manipulation, that they need more surveillance.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Enzer highlighted that ETH staking could be one of the biggest concerns for the SEC.\n\nAmidst the May approval dilemma, ETH has slumped 9% on weekly charts, dropping from $3645 to $3200, partly because of Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] massive drawdown.\n\nShould the bearish overhangs from the current unfavorable macro front persist, ETH bears could extend the drop to a $3000 psychological level."

        "content": "Ethereum could see its market structure flipped bearishly upon a descent below $3050.\n\nThe momentum and selling pressure were rising steadily and could force more losses.\n\nThe past 24 hours saw a strong wave of selling pressure. Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] noted losses of 7%-8% each, and a deeper drop appeared likely. The $3.5k level was a key short-term support for ETH.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that a bear pennant formation was brewing. If it came to fruition, a drop to $2.8k could be on the cards. Will the bears fulfill this prediction?\n\nThe bear pennant or the demand zone- who will win this round?\n\nAMBCrypto highlighted the pennant formation in white. Based on the length of the flagpole, a drop to $2.6k could commence. The $2.8k-$2.9k was a region where ETH consolidated in February before its push beyond $3k.\n\nHence, it could serve as support on the way down and repulse the bears. The $3.1k region was also a lower timeframe bullish order block which saw a significant reaction from the price earlier this month.\n\nThe trading volume has decreased over the past two weeks as Ethereum formed a bearish pattern. The break beneath the rising trendline confirmed the pattern was playing out. A fall below $3056 will flip the market structure bearishly on the 12-hour chart.\n\nEthereum was undervalued, but should you rush to buy it now?\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of some of Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metrics noted positive findings for investors. The 30-day MVRV ratio has been below zero since 18th March, showing an undervalued asset.\n\nYet, the mean coin age, which had trended downward since the 9th of February, began to trend higher.\n\nTogether, it was a strong buy signal. However, this signal is not a short-term one. Risk management needs to be formulated based on technical analysis as well, and at press time, the bears have the advantage.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nComparing the network growth in March to January, it showed that an increasing number of new addresses were created on the network.\n\nThe total Open Interest fell alongside the price to indicate short-term bearish sentiment. However, the evidence at hand showed that a drop to $3.1k or $2.6k would still present a buying opportunity for long-term holders."

        "content": "Key Takeaways Blockchain technology company Ripple on Thursday announced a plan to issue a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks.\n\nStablecoins operate at the center of the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, and this new stablecoin issuance is intended to attract new users and liquidity to XRP Ledger.\n\nCurrently, Tether USD is by far the largest stablecoin when measured by market capitalization, with more than $100 billion worth of tokens in circulation.\n\nBlockchain technology company Ripple said Thursday that it plans to launch a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin in an effort to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance and to generate more uses and liquidity for the XRP Ledger blockchain.\n\nRipple's new stablecoin will be issued on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks at first, and the main goal is to drive more liquidity, developers, and users to XRP Ledger, which is the native blockchain of the digital asset XRP. It joins the growing stablecoin market, in which crypto tokens are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and are backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasurys, and other cash equivalents.\n\nThe Ripple stablecoin is also expected to be launched on additional blockchains over time. \u201cThis is a natural step for Ripple to continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto,\u201d Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement.\n\nRipple continues to deal with a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the legal classification of XRP as a security.\n\nDeFi Is Built on Stablecoins\n\nAs a massive holder of XRP, Ripple has an incentive to bring more financial activity to XRP Ledger. And it's no secret that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is mostly built on stablecoins on various blockchains.\n\nFor example, six of the top 10 trading pairs ranked by seven-day trading volume on the version of DeFi exchange Uniswap that exists on Ethereum involved at least one stablecoin as of Thursday. Additionally, three of the top five borrowed assets on the Ethereum version of open-source liquidity protocol Aave are stablecoins.\n\nWrapped Bitcoin, which is a token backed by Bitcoin that's held by digital asset custody provider BitGo in a manner similar to a stablecoin, is also a top asset used in these DeFi apps.\n\nWay To Attract More Users to XRP Ledger\n\nWith so much concentration of DeFi activity in stablecoins, Ripple said it sees the issuance of its own stablecoin as a way to attract users to the XRP Ledger ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe XRP Ledger\u2019s native capabilities, including a decentralized exchange and automated market maker, were built to utilize XRP as the bridge asset,\" Ripple President Monica Long said. \"Bringing a trusted stablecoin onto XRPL will drive more adoption and development, contributing to a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\n\nTether (USDT) is the current juggernaut of the stablecoin market, with a total value of just over $106 billion in circulation on various blockchains as of Thursday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The only other noteworthy stablecoin offering in terms of size is USD Coin, which had a total market cap of just under $33 billion as of Thursday afternoon."

        "content": "Recently, the prestigious investment company VanEck has published its vision regarding the medium-term future of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2, now on the lips of all users of the decentralized world.\n\nThe hedge fund predicts a bright future for this sector niche, which could reach a valuation of 1,000 billion dollars by 2030.\n\nAt the same time, however, a parallel failure of many solutions that will not be able to emerge in the midst of fierce competition is expected.\n\nBelow all the details.\n\nVaneck on Ethereum\u2019s layer-2: bullish even if many will disappear\n\nThe US Fund Manager VanEck, recently involved in the loud request for an ETH spot ETF to the SEC, has just revealed a contrasting medium-term view on the future of Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solutions.\n\nAccording to studies by the well-known investment company, the sector could experience growth of up to $1 trillion by 2030 in a context where blockchain is able to overcome the scalability limits currently affecting it.\n\nEthereum Layer-2 market cap hitting $1 trillion by 2030\n\n\n\nCiting scalability solutions like Optimistic and Zk Roll-Ups.\n\n\n\n-According to a new research report published by VanEck on April 3. \ud83d\udc47#Ethereum #EthereumETF #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/2ksarqs4pb \u2014 Bitinning (@bitinning) April 4, 2024\n\nSpecifically, VanEck analysts Patrick Bush and Matthew Sigel estimate that Ethereum will eventually capture 60% of the market share across all public decentralized networks, establishing itself as the most widely used cryptographic network in the world.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum layer-2 market is worth 39 billion dollars, with Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base leading the ranking:\n\nOn one hand, VanEck shows a predominantly bullish trend for this niche of the Ethereum universe, on the other hand, it believes that the competition in the sector will make several projects obsolete.\n\nOn the long-term prospects of many of these second-level networks, the company actually considers them \u201cgenerally bearish\u201c, with a good portion of them destined to disappear.\n\nVanEck has predicted that out of the 46 L2 chains currently on the market, despite the positive outlook that will attract new investments, the emergence of dozens of other competitors will lead to the failure of many of these.\n\nAs shown by the data from L2Beat, the top 3 layer-2 solutions on Ethereum alone capture about $29.3 billion, more than 70% of the total TVL of the sector.\n\nSigel and Bush also believe that the tokens of these infrastructures have a still too high unlocked supply, potentially harmful to the market due to a too aggressive dilution.\n\nHere is what the analysts reported verbatim:\n\n\u201cThe first 7 tokens for L2 collectively already have a $40 billion FDV and there are many strong projects planning to launch in the medium term. This means that there is potentially an additional $100 billion in FDV in L2 tokens that will enter the market in the next 12-18 months. It seems like a bridge too far for the cryptocurrency market to absorb even limited amounts of such supply without huge discounts.\u201d\n\nIn such a scenario, only the most innovative solutions capable of obtaining a constant flow of active users and on-chain volumes will be able to survive and benefit from the growth of the Ethereum world.\n\nThe Outlook of the Ethereum World: The Most Promising L2 Solutions\n\nWhile the Ethereum layer-2 sector shows more and more signs of congestion, significant of excessive competition, the best solutions are preparing to attract the next phase of mass adoption.\n\nAt this moment, the safest L2s to bet on for the future are the top 3 networks Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base which form a separate market thanks to their much higher valuation compared to other contenders.\n\nBase in particular could have a preferential adoption channel in the future, being supported by the large cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase which boasts a sum of about 7 million monthly active users.\n\nFollowing are other layer-2 solutions that likely have a chance to establish themselves in this world of sharks: Blast, Starknet, ZkSync Era, Zora, Scroll, Linea, Fraxtal, Mantle, and Mode Network.\n\nAmong those who can rely on luxury backers, such as Consensys for Linea or Matter Labs for zkSync, and among those with innovative infrastructural features like Fraxtal and Mode, all these solutions could play a crucial role in the future of Ethereum.\n\nMany other networks, on the other hand, which generally have a TVL lower than 100 million dollars, may struggle to find their ideal role.\n\nAs layer-2 solutions, these blockchains serve solely as an alternative channel to reduce the workload on the Ethereum mainnet, helping the main network in terms of scalability.\n\nThe most requested qualities, in addition to the presence of a rich ecosystem of opportunities guaranteed by important backers, are therefore those of fast transaction execution and competitive commission costs.\n\nOnly the best will survive this race for cryptographic efficiency.\n\nSpeaking of fees, we emphasize how the recent Dencun update has allowed for a significant reduction in fees on L2."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nCrypto is expecting a significant bull run, with the total crypto market cap at over $2.5 trillion as of April 4, 2024. Bitcoin has a big share here, at about $1.302 trillion, breaking into the top 10 assets in the world by market capitalisation and taking the ninth spot.\n\n\n\nExperts have been issuing optimistic forecasts in the long term across all sectors of the crypto economy, including a recent prediction from Van Eck analysts: they expect Ethereum layer 2 tokens to hit $1 trillion in market capitalisation by 2030.\n\n\n\nTo elaborate on this: said Van Eck analysts were bearish on these L2 tokens owing to tight competition, but they do see Ethereum layer 2 scaling networks reaching $1 trillion in market cap and being made up of many use case-specific chains by 2030.\n\n\n\nAs Van Eck\u2019s Patrick Bush- senior digital assets investment analyst, and Matthew Sigel- digital assets research head, stated, these layer 2 blockchains are all about solving for the primary challenge Ethereum faces, which is \u201climited capacity to process, store, and compute data.\u201d They expect Ethereum to expand to about 60 percent of the market share throughout all public blockchains, and the estimation of the volume of assets harboured on Ethereum based on this prediction amounts to the $1 trillion amount they have mentioned.\n\n\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges have long been highlighted by the crypto community, especially as Ethereum situated itself at the heart of DeFi with its smart contract functionality. As the aforementioned Van Eck analysts stated, \u201cEthereum\u2019s dominance in smart contracts faces a critical hurdle: scalability\u2026. While the network offers unparalleled security and decentralisation, transaction fees and processing times soar when usage intensifies.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe proof of stake transition is expected to take care of a part of these challenges in the coming years, but layer 2 protocols to share the burden are expected to remain as relevant as ever.\n\n\n\nThe recent Dencun upgrade for Ethereum in March brought down layer 2 transaction fees through data-saving features called \u2018Blobs\u2019, which shows the network is putting thought into making layer 2 data processing more efficient. As institutional interest grows in Ethereum, the blockchain seemingly has an upward trajectory ahead.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

Meanwhile, a new contender is making waves: BlockDAG, with its audacious promise of a 20,000x return on investment, is turning heads and setting the stage for a potential market shake-up. This remarkable projection is particularly striking against the backdrop of WAX\u2019s strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services, showing the diverse and dynamic nature of the crypto investment scene.\n\nAs Ethereum reinforces its legacy, BlockDAG\u2019s bold ambitions are catching the fancy of investors, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the future of cryptocurrency growth and profitability.\n\nEthereum Hits ATH in Addresses: What\u2019s Next for ETH Price?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is showing signs of a strong recovery, bouncing back from its March lows of $3,000 to trade at $3,615. The surge in the number of Ethereum addresses with non-zero balances to an all-time high of 118.23K indicates heightened investor activity.\n\nWith whale transactions on the rise and the ETH price maintaining support above $3,550, there is potential for further upward momentum.\n\nWAX\u2019s Web 3 Partnership with AWS\n\nWAX has joined forces with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to integrate its blockchain tools into the Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), streamlining the development of blockchain-based games and applications. This collaboration allows developers to deploy WAX blockchain nodes directly from the AWS console, simplifying the development process for both the WAX mainnet and testnet.\n\nBy providing fast and reliable blockchain infrastructure, including WAX Blockchain nodes for real-time interactions and data queries, this partnership aims to facilitate the creation of Web3 gaming experiences.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s Presale Bull Run Positions it Among Top Crypto Investments\n\nBlockDAG Network stands out for its exceptional transaction speed, achieving 10,000 to 15,000 transaction confirmations per second (TPS), surpassing traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        "title": "Is Solana EVM Compatible and What Does It Actually Mean? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Solana (SOL), a rapidly growing blockchain platform, has been turning heads in the crypto industry because of its remarkable scalability and transaction speed. However, one aspect that has grabbed particular attention is Solana\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). If you also want to know whether Solana is EVM compatible, then keep reading.\n\nThis exhaustive piece explores what Solana EVM compatibility means, its advantages, and practical applications.\n\nUnderstanding EVM\n\nThe EVM is the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a decentralized computer featuring a sandboxed environment, meaning that it operates independently of the host computer system.\n\nThe EVM allows for the deployment and execution of arbitrary algorithms in a series of opcodes. Moreover, it provides the backbone for the decentralized apps (dApps) that are the hallmark of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn simpler terms, the EVM serves as a large, global, decentralized computer. Each smart contract is like a \u201cprogram\u201d that runs on this computer. Every Ethereum node runs its own EVM instance. This ensures that all computations are performed consistently. Consequently, the state of the blockchain remains synchronized across all nodes.\n\nWhy would you only learn about blockchains when you could be building one? Get started today.\n\nSolana and EVM: A compatible match\n\nThe Solana EVM serves as a bridge, letting dApps and transactions designed for the Ethereum network run seamlessly on the Solana blockchain as well. This compatibility layer means that Ethereum developers can transition their dApps to Solana without modifying any code.\n\nBuilt on the high-speed Solana blockchain, which can handle as many as 65,000 transactions per second, the Solana EVM offers far greater speed and scalability compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second.\n\nWhy is Solana\u2019s user activity plunging lower? Find out today.\n\nEVM compatibility: A game changer for Solana\n\nEVM compatibility is a significant breakthrough for Solana. This interoperability is a much-needed step towards addressing one of the biggest challenges that the crypto industry faces today.\n\nEVM compatibility brings about time savings, reduces knowledge transfer costs, and cuts back on development requirements. It attracts users, talent, and innovation from the Ethereum ecosystem to other blockchain platforms.\n\nThe boons of Solana EVM\n\nSolana EVM offers various benefits, including:\n\nEfficient scaling: Thanks to the Solana network, Web 3 developers can enjoy low gas fees and high throughput. This is due to its parallel processing (Sealevel) and unique innovations like Proof-of-History. The mechanism enables 400ms block times.\n\nIntegration with Solana ecosystem: Ethereum developers and creators have the opportunity to leverage Solana\u2019s robust ecosystem. This includes its developer community, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. They can either migrate to or expand their applications with the use of Solana EVM.\n\nUsing familiar tools: EVM developers can continue using tools that they are already comfortable with. These include tools like MetaMask, Truffle, and Waffle, ensuring a seamless developer experience.\n\nAdapting smart contracts easily: Existing Ethereum dApps can be ported over to Solana Programs (i.e., Solana smart contracts) without any reconfiguration of the underlying smart contracts.\n\nDemocratizing access: Lastly, by using a Solana EVM, the users, talent, and innovation of the Ethereum ecosystem can easily adapt to projects on both blockchains.\n\nThe force behind Solana EVM\n\nNeon Labs is the company that developed the first EVM on Solana. The Neon EVM is a cross-chain solution that allows dApp developers to leverage the benefits of Solana to expand their services, offering new products like arbitrage or high-frequency trading, growing their user base, and reducing costs where possible, including gas fees.\n\nIts ERC-20/SPL wrapper is an implementation of the ERC-20 interface for SPL tokens that ensures Solana applications interact with Neon EVM contracts.\n\nGetting started with Neon EVM\n\nTo kickstart your journey with Neon EVM, the fastest route is to set up MetaMask and link it to the NeonEVM devnet either via Chainlist or by manual configuration. Developers eager to delve deeper can consult the Neon EVM documentation for further insights, and they can acquire test NEON tokens by utilizing either the NeonFaucet website or its API.\n\nThe future of blockchain with Solana EVM\n\nThe emphasis on EVM compatibility is poised to catalyze a new wave of multi-chain applications, strengthen network collaboration, and elevate the user experience as the focus shifts toward more scalable solutions. As the landscape evolves, the union of Solana and Ethereum ecosystems via EVM compatibility offers an intriguing glimpse into the future of blockchain tech. For developers keen on harnessing Solana\u2019s capabilities, the timing couldn\u2019t be better to delve into this cutting-edge platform and discover its vast potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum it up, Solana being EVM compatible signifies a significant leap in the blockchain ecosystem. It brings together the robustness of Ethereum with the efficiency of Solana.\n\nAs the crypto industry strives to resolve its scalability and interoperability issues, the advent of Solana EVM might just be the solution it needs. The future of blockchain technology looks promising with such innovative approaches. Lastly, it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s next on the horizon."

        "content": "Wed 03 Apr 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nRestaking is a new evolution of staking in decentralized finance (DeFi). This new form of staking allows users to reuse their already staked cryptos to secure other protocols and decentralized products. This emerging trend offers not only opportunities but also presents significant risks for Ethereum.\n\nThe Crypto Opportunities of Restaking for Ethereum\n\nThe crypto exchange Coinbase has recently spoken about the practice of restaking. It believes that this emerging trend around staking presents significant opportunities for Ethereum. The position of this market within decentralized finance (DeFi) is evident.\n\nIndeed, restaking currently constitutes the second-largest market in decentralized finance (DeFi). This growth is marked by the expansion of crypto protocols such as EigenLayer.\n\nThis protocol has established itself as the second-largest within DeFi with a total value locked (TVL) of $12.4 billion, by allowing validators to secure actively validated services (AVS) through restaking their ethers.\n\nIt is clear that liquid restaking platforms are emerging as a key element in the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. Yet, amidst this growth, concerns arise about the risks associated with restaking and its impact on the network.\n\nEthereum Could Face 'Hidden Risks' From Ballooning Restaking Market: Coinbase https://t.co/UJ4m2kH8PK \u2014 ghostz (@ghostz_crypto) April 2, 2024 Restaking offers Ethereum new opportunities while raising concerns about the stability of the network\n\nThe Risks Not To Be Ignored\n\nCoinbase raises concerns about the risks associated with restaking, particularly from a financial and security standpoint. The company believes that the opaque nature of some restaking strategies and the potential disruptions of underlying assets pose challenges.\n\nOne notable concern highlighted by Coinbase is the risk that stakers may rush towards platforms offering the highest rewards. Such potential behavior could have implications for the stability of Ethereum.\n\nIndeed, the rush towards more lucrative staking platforms could encourage excessive restaking, which would increase complexity and potential vulnerabilities within the network.\n\nFurthermore, Coinbase points out the difficulty of evaluating risk-adjusted rewards in the evolving landscape of restaking. Hence the need for transparency and due diligence on the part of all stakeholders. Despite these challenges, the exchange recognizes the transformative potential and innovation of restaking for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Year-to-date inflows went into digital asset funds reached $13.13 billion.\n\nBitcoin, Solana were high on demand, while Ethereum saw outflows.\n\nDigital asset funds were back to winning ways last week, spearheaded by strong investments into the newly-launched Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETFs in the U.S.\n\nStrong recovery\n\nAs per data shared by James Butterfill, Head of Research at crypto asset management firm CoinShares, about $862 million in net inflows was recorded across institutional crypto products\n\nThis was a sharp rebound from the $942 million in outflows seen a week earlier.\n\nThe latest capital infusion propelled year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $13.13 billion. For context, this was nearly 25% higher than the total inflows recorded in 2021 \u2014 the year of the crypto market\u2019s last bull run.\n\nDuring the week, the total assets under management (AuM) swelled to $98 billion, marking an increase of 11% from the week before.\n\nAUM is an important performance gradient of a fund. The higher the value of AuM, the more investments it tends to attract. AUM depends on the inflows and the market value of the underlying asset.\n\nLast month, the AUM hit $100 billion for the first time in history, as Bitcoin smashed to its all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. However, subsequent price correction caused the AUM to drop to current levels.\n\nBitcoin remains institutions\u2019 favorite\n\nOn expected lines, Bitcoin-linked funds led the charge, pocketing $865 million in inflows last week. With this, total inflows since the beginning of the year rose to an impressive $12.8 billion.\n\nThe surge could be attributed to strong demand for U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted $860 million in inflows last week.\n\nRobust inflows into new ETFs led by BlackRock\u2019s IBIT helped offset outflows from incumbent issuer Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, which has been bleeding since transitioning to an ETF.\n\nEthereum loses, Solana gains\n\nOn the other hand, funds tied to second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum [ETH] saw outflows worth $19 million last week. The bearish sentiment likely flowed from lower chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nSolana-based investment products witnessed inflows of $6 million last week, spurred by impressive price performance of the native asset SOL."

I think theres a chance we can come up on a peak/blow off top near 20k.\n\n\n\nIt's pretty simple- I think $BTC can realistically 2x from our last high at 69k- which means most alts will do multiples of that.\n\n\n\nFor $ETH, a 3-4x of prior ATH puts us at 15-20k. https://t.co/LfH6WyNtFY \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 31, 2024\n\nRead More: Big Move Ahead?

A projected 3-4x increase from its previous peak could propel Ethereum into the $15,000-$20,000 range. Despite a recent dip in Ethereum\u2019s price to $3,484, reflecting a modest decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours, Credible remains steadfast in his long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency.\n\nI made a mistake here. I was looking at fully diluted valuation for XRP.\n\n\n\nReality is at current circulating supply a 10k ETH is equivalent to a $20+ $XRP.\n\n\n\nSo if you think $10 is impossible for XRP but 10k ETH is realistic for ETH you need to check your bias real quick.\n\n\n\nBoth\u2026 https://t.co/IPsElR7xBx \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 31, 2024\n\nA Surge Incoming?\n\nShifting focus to XRP, Credible anticipates a potential breakthrough, suggesting XRP could surpass the $10 mark. He points to XRP\u2019s past achievement of surpassing Ethereum\u2019s market cap in a previous market cycle, indicating the possibility of significant gains for the altcoin.\n\nWith XRP currently trading at $0.614, Credible\u2019s forecast underscores the resilience of XRP, despite occasional setbacks, and hints at imminent new highs.\n\n$BTC probs going to continue ranging for a few more days at least. Bids now capping price on the downside (or attempting to) the same way asks were capping upside earlier. OI is building up though so we should get some nice volatility once we break out of this range. pic.twitter.com/zIF3DjlfES \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 29, 2024\n\nBitcoin is Building Momentum!\n\nAll eyes are on Bitcoin\u2019s next move, especially with the looming halving event. While initial projections speculated a surge beyond $80,000 before the halving and even higher figures afterward, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory has been less predictable. However, Credible remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term prospects, despite potential short-term fluctuations.\n\nIn the near term, Credible suggests Bitcoin may continue to trade sideways for a brief period. He notes a consolidation of bids, indicating potential support levels, coupled with a buildup of open interest, hinting at imminent volatility once the market breaks out of its current range.\n\nWith Bitcoin currently trading at $68,508, investors eagerly await clarity on the market\u2019s direction.\n\nThis Might Interest You: Top 10 Altcoins for Biggest Returns in 2024\n\nMarket Pullback Soon?\n\nExploring the recent market pullback, Kristian Haralampiev, Nexo\u2019s Structured Products Lead, attributes the downturn to profit-taking by investors capitalizing on peak market conditions. Haralampiev highlights increased cryptocurrency volumes flowing into exchanges, particularly from short-term traders enjoying profits, as per data from Glassnode.\n\nDespite the unexpected pullback amidst expectations of Bitcoin scaling new heights, both Credible and Haralampiev view it as an opportune moment for latecomers to enter the market ahead of the next Bitcoin halving event."
