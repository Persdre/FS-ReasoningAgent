        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s fix for its gas fee problem is now live: What you need to know about the Dencun upgrade - Fortune",
        "content": "On Wednesday morning, the Ethereum blockchain completed an upgrade called Dencun, the biggest change to the network\u2019s code in over a year. The upgrade is an important step to help the world\u2019s second-most valuable blockchain overcome its scaling challenges, and reduce its infamous gas fees. But what exactly is Dencun and how does it work? Our plain-English explainer tells all you need to know.\n\nWhat is the Dencun upgrade?\n\nDencun describes two upgrades that took place at the same time on Ethereum. The name combines the \u201cCancun\u201d upgrade of the execution layer and the \u201cDeneb\u201d upgrade on the consensus layer. The latter refers to how network users agree on the state of the blockchain, while the former refers to how transactions are processed.\n\nIn technical terms, the upgrade is the result of a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d or EIP-4844, which improves the blockchain\u2019s propensity to handle data from secondary networks.\n\nGathering of the five families in London for the Dencun upgrade pic.twitter.com/4cyxFSQoVh \u2014 David Mihal.eth (@dmihal) March 13, 2024\n\nWhy did Dencun come about in the first place?\n\nThe upgrade will lower gas fees for the growing number of networks built on top of Ethereum that are known as Layer 2 (L2), or \u201croll-ups.\u201d This is important since gas fees have historically soared whenever there is a surge of activity on the blockchain, making it unviable to use at a large scale. Roll-ups help address this by processing transactions separately, and then stamping them to the main Ethereum blockchain in batches.\n\nWhile roll-ups have already made Ethereum more efficient, one issue that is that, post-compression, nodes processing transactions hold on to L2 data infinitely, requiring a greater volume of hardware as time goes on. This has meant that over 90% of the fees on roll-ups are used for this data storage.\n\nThe upgrade means L2 data will be added to the base Ethereum network via fleeting, more efficient \u201cblobs\u201d rather than data held indefinitely. Instead, \u201cblob data\u201d will be stored for 18 days.\n\nWhat about the main Ethereum network?\n\nThe overall effect should be lower costs, but users on the main blockchain (L1) won\u2019t enjoy these lower fees until at least 2026\u20132027, says Pitchbook\u2019s crypto analyst Robert Le, until there is \u201cfull danksharding,\u201d referring to a roll-up scaling method which provides extra storage for increased transactional capacity.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, you\u2019ll see less and less individual users, whether retail or businesses, transact directly on Ethereum. More will move to L2s and the only ones transacting on Ethereum will be the rollups,\u201d he said.\n\nEIP-4844 marks the beginning of the \u201cSurge\u201d phase for Ethereum, outlined by the network\u2019s cofounder Vitalik Buterin in December. The aim of this phase is to reach 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nHow much will Dencun lower fees?\n\nGas fees had risen to an average of 98 gwei (a denomination worth one-billionth of an Ether, the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain) the week before the upgrade, a level not seen since early May 2023, according to Ethercan data. A swap would cost users $87.45 in gas fees on average, while non-fungible token (NFT) sales average $147 in gas.\n\nAfter the Ethereum Dencun upgrade this week, EIP-4844 will reduce L2 gas fees. According to IntoTheBlock statistics, for a DEX swap, the gas fee for Aribitrum will be reduced from $2.02 to $0.4, Optimism will be reduced from $1.42 to $0.28, Base will be reduced from $0.58 to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/0x6jGDYF5z \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2024\n\nL2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. Swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges, which currently costs $1\u2013$2, should fall to around 10\u201320 cents, and could even go as low as a fraction of a cent.\n\nWhat does Dencun mean for the price of Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) has climbed over 150% since October. Last week it broke $4,000, for the second time ever, where it has hovered since, indicating it could soon pass its all-time high of $4,878.26, reached in November 2021.\n\nThe price surge is part of a broader bull crypto bull market spurred by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, and optimism that regulators will approve Ethereum ETFs, too, this year. But experts told Fortune they foresee the upgrade having a continued, positive impact on ETH\u2019s price that could be more significant than ETFs, as investors bet on the network\u2019s development potential.\n\nIt will be an \u201cabsolute game changer\u201d for the token, and is the \u201cbigger story right now,\u201d Matt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s CIO, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cThere are a billion applications you can build if transactions are below a penny that you can\u2019t build if they range from 10 to 50 cents,\u201d said Hougan. \u201cOnce we get them reliably free to people, you will see financial applications, DeFi and NFTs, but you will also see nonfinancial applications. I think we\u2019re gonna see this massive explosion of mainstream uses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a new type of technology, a new type of platform. I think that\u2019s what ETH has going for it on the sentiment side, and why it\u2019s doing so well,\u201d Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, added."

        "title": "Ethereum Completes Milestone Dencun Upgrade, Which Should Substantially Reduce Fees - Unchained",
        "content": "Layer 2 blockchain networks can now use a different way to store data, which is intended to help these rollups scale the Ethereum blockchain network that was plagued by huge spikes in gas fees in years prior.\n\nEthereum has completed a significant upgrade of its blockchain network, which is expected to pave the way for the next generation of crypto users to transact onchain without suffering significant spikes in gas fees.\n\nThe upgrade, named \u201cDencun,\u201d was completed early morning Wednesday ET after it was activated on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet at epoch height of 269568, according to Ethereum developers in a live stream on YouTube. At one point, more than 3,600 people were watching the official rollout of Dencun on the livestream.\n\n\u201cWe basically enter this new era of Ethereum scalability,\u201d said Anthony Sassano, the creator of Ethereum-focused media site The Daily Gwei, referring to how Dencun implements EIP-4844 and \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which creates a highly optimized and much cheaper storage space where rollups can post data to called \u201cblobspace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first step on a long journey that has been going on for a few years now towards what we [Ethereum contributors] call full danksharding, which will greatly increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability properties specifically for layer 2s,\u201d Sassano added.\n\nRead more: How Much Will the Dencun Upgrade Really Reduce Ethereum Layer 2 Fees By?\n\nDencun is Ethereum\u2019s most substantial software change since Shapella, which occurred about 10 months ago. Before the hard fork upgrade, rollups had to store information such as transaction history in calldata, which is \u201creally expensive, because Ethereum calldata has to be stored forever,\u201d said Polygon\u2019s vice president of product, David Silverman, in an interview with Unchained.\n\nAfter the upgrade, when rollups post data to this new blobspace in the form of \u201cblobs,\u201d the information isn\u2019t stored forever and so it\u2019s much cheaper, while still providing similar security guarantees. Consequently, \u201crollups can generally pass those cost [savings] on along to their users,\u201d lowering transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks, Silverman added.\n\nThis impact could occur immediately or more gradually over time. The various L2s will go through their respective governance processes to change the target of where they\u2019re posting data from either calldata to blobspace or possibly a mix of the two. This means some networks may see changes immediately on day one, while others may take as long as a month-and-a-half, depending on when their governance votes are held and how easy it is for a rollup to integrate the upgrade, noted Silverman.\n\nFor example, the team for the layer 2 blockchain network Base, which was incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, said in a blog post that Base will have support for the Dencun upgrade on the first day.\n\nAnother Ethereum rollup, zkSync, is already ready to submit blob transactions, per Daniel Lumi, senior product manager at Matter Labs, the software firm building zkSync, adding that zkSync has a solution for where the protocol decides to post data.\n\nGetting Lucky\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comes as the price of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, is trading around $4,000, a level not seen since the end of 2021 before Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Ethereum developers don\u2019t implement upgrades based on market pressure, the Dencun upgrade implementation coinciding with the start of an early bull market and ETH trading around the $4,000 level is \u201clucky,\u201d Silverman noted.\n\nThe DeFi Summer in 2020 ended in part because Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure was not ready to accommodate the mass of new users coming onchain, which became evident when gas prices to execute a token swap on a decentralized exchange soared to hundreds of dollars.\n\nAs a result of Dencun and specifically EIP-4844, which will bring transaction costs down, \u201cwe now have a ton more capacity from all these rollups to handle this next generation of users without gas prices spiking up to $200 [or] $300 per swap, killing our momentum,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cWe got lucky in the sense that we got this [the Dencun upgrade] out of the way before retail is coming back.\u201d"

Dencun ships a total of 9 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in all, making it tied for the largest single hard fork in terms of improvements shipped, according to Tim Beiko, who coordinates the Ethereum core developer calls, on the Ethereum Foundation livestream commemorating the event.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024\n\nPost-Dencun, most rollups and their users will see benefits within hours to days, as the availability of data blobs on Ethereum \u2014 introduced by EIP-4844 \u2014 should slash transaction fees by 5-10x.\n\nThis real-world benefit to users is primarily driving anticipation for the upgrade, according to Hannes Graah, a builder of crypto wallet Zeal.\n\n\u201cThe Dencun upgrade brings us closer to a future where fees are an afterthought, not a dealbreaker,\u201d Graah told Blockworks. \u201cJust as we generally don\u2019t worry about the cost of traditional domestic bank transfers, Web3 users should be able to transact without worrying about fees.\u201d\n\nAki Balogh, co-founder and CEO of DLC.Link, likens EIP-4844 to the \u201cNoSQL movement of the 2010s,\u201d which removed constraints of structured SQL data, through developments like MongoDB.\n\n\u201cGiving developers large blobs of temporary data (deleted after 30 days) provides them the opportunity to innovate while not increasing load on the network,\u201d Balogh told Blockworks, removing a major Ethereum bottleneck. \u201cSimilar to Mongo\u2019s effect, this proposal will help innovation as dApps and chains find new ways to use the temp storage space,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to scaling in Web2, this new data storage channel for Ethereum doesn\u2019t sacrifice decentralization, notes Philippe Schommers, head of infrastructure at Gnosis, which implemented Dencun already on Monday.\n\nRead more: Gnosis Chain premieres Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork\n\n\u201cWhen working towards scalability solutions on the blockchain, there are choices that developers have to make to prioritize decentralization,\u201d Schommers told Blockworks. \u201cWhen you look at Web2 infrastructure, it\u2019s easy to see how centralized scalability can be done, but that\u2019s not the path we\u2019re trying to follow.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cless glamorous\u201d Schommers said, it was part of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cbig ambition,\u201d calling Dencun \u201cone piece of the puzzle that gets us a little bit closer to building a larger scale, fully decentralized network.\u201d\n\nOthers are more effusive.\n\nLucas Henning, chief technology officer of Suku, says it\u2019s still early days and the upgrade \u201cwill guide the Ethereum ecosystem towards a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for Ethereum, and I am keen to see the effects of these changes on the decentralized world landscape,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, president of StarkWare. \u201cToday will go down as the date of birth for a dapp-for-everything culture.\u201d\n\nUpdated March 13, 2024 at 11:30 am ET, clarifying Dencun is equal to one earlier fork for the most number of EIPs included.\n\nCorrection March 13, 2024 at 1:40 pm ET: Misattribution of one quote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What You Need To Know Ahead of Ethereum's Dencun Update Wednesday - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Ethereum's next major network update, known as \"Dencun,\" is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nDencun is expected to lower transaction fees on the many Layer 2 networks built on top of the base Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis update is part of a major push by Ethereum developers to head toward mass scalability via Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nReports from digital asset managers Grayscale and Fidelity Digital Assets indicate the update could be a boon for scaling the overall Ethereum userbase.\n\nEthereum is scheduled to undergo a network update called the Deneb-Cancun, or Dencun, on Wednesday, aimed at improving user experience and lowering transaction fees for some users on the the network's Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nEther (ETH), the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, soared past $4,000 early Wednesday, but gave up some of those gains to trade a shade under that threshold at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.\n\nWhat is the Dencun Ethereum Update?\n\nThe Dencun update prioritizes scalability, efficiency, and security through the implementation of various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the most notable change is EIP-4844 for proto-danksharding, which seeks to optimize gas fees for Layer 2 network (L2) data and enhance the network's ability to handle greater transaction volumes via those secondary layers.\n\nExchanges may face delays in processing Ethereum transactions on Wednesday as the update rolls out. Coinbase (COIN) said Monday that it expects disruption due to the update to last for at least an hour on or around 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, although that could change. Kraken, meanwhile, is budgeting for about 15 mins of delay for maintenance around 4:00 a.m. Eastern time and recommends users \"not to place or cancel orders during this timeframe.\"\n\nBlobs, Rollups, Gas: What Is Changing?\n\nLayer 2 networks, such as rollups, are secondary blockchains built on top of the base Ethereum network. In a bid to scale transaction volumes, rollups compress transactions by bundling them. The initial verification for those transactions happens off the chain, but the transactions are settled on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHowever, even with the compression, nodes processing transactions hold on to Layer 2 data forever, expanding their hardware requirements, which are then passed on to users via higher transaction or gas fees. More than 90% of the fees paid by users on rollups are because of this data storage.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will alter that, allowing information related to Layer 2 networks to be added to the base Ethereum blockchain via temporary, more efficiently stored \"blobs\" rather than as permanent data. As of this writing, blob data will be available for 18 days. This is intended to lower costs.\n\n\"Each byte of data that L2s store on Ethereum costs roughly 16 gas. The introduction of blobs and a new fee market designed for blob data drops the gas cost down to 1 per byte of data stored,\" noted Fidelity Digital Assets in a report about the upgrade. \"This is a maximum gas cost reduction of 94%!\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Ethereum users on the main blockchain or Layer 1 users won't stand to benefit much from the lower fees found on Layer 2 networks after the upgrade.\n\nMore Accessible and Competitive Ethereum?\n\n\"Currently, Ethereum\u2019s performance is hindered by its slow transaction speed, low throughput, and high costs for users. With average transaction fees of $2.3 as of February 22nd, Ethereum is significantly more expensive versus alternatives like Solana. This threatens to drive away end users to other chains,\" said crypto asset manager Grayscale in a report.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade \"could help Ethereum compete in terms of scalability with faster chains,\" the Grayscale report said.\n\nFidelity also points out that in addition to differentiating it from competitors, the latest changes to the Ethereum network could help transition from being a general-purpose blockchain to a global database for Layer 2 networks. The best way to gauge the success of the Dencun upgrade will be to track the number of Layer 2 users via a metric such as active addresses,\" Fidelity said.\n\n\n\n(Update\u2014March 13, 2024: This story has been updated with more recent ETH price information.)"

        "title": "Blockchain startup Sei Labs creates an interesting solution to make Ethereum faster - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Sei Labs, a startup co-founded by a former Robinhood engineer and a former VC from Coatue, has launched a new open sourced project that offers a novel and exciting approach to make Ethereum faster and less expensive for developers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sei launched The Parallel Stack, a public good project \u2014 meaning free for any crypto developers to use. It aims to improve the performance of transactions per second (TPS) of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based layer-2 blockchains through the tried-and-true computer science concept of parallel processing, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\n\nSei Labs is a company the crypto community is already watching after it raised $30 million, at a valuation of $800 million, about a year ago to build its own super-speedy, open source, layer-1 blockchain focused specifically on crypto trading.\n\nBut now Sei has turned its attention to help improve Ethereum, a far bigger, more established blockchain, the biggest by total value locked, according to CoinMarketCap \u2014 aka the value of all the digital assets on the network.\n\nBy default, EVMs process transactions sequentially, one after another, a slow and inefficient method that doesn\u2019t scale well.\n\n\u201cThe biggest limitation of the EVM is the lack of throughput,\u201d Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, formerly of Robinhood, told TechCrunch. Ethereum\u2019s throughput can\u2019t go beyond 50 TPS, which is limiting growth of its ecosystem and results in high so-called gas fees, the fees charged to transact on Ethereum blockchains. These fees make Ethereum unaffordable for \u201c99.9% of normal users,\u201d Jog added.\n\nAside from The Parallel Stack, Sei Labs has also been working on upgrading its blockchain to Sei V2, a parallelized EVM, which processes multiple transactions simultaneously and would make it accessible to a \u201cglobal base of EVM developers,\u201d according to a November 2023 blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on scaling EVM for a long time and doing it by parallelizing,\u201d Jog said.\n\nObviously, the higher the transactions per second, the faster, more efficient and scalable a network is. For reference, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, by default, averages 5 TPS, while Ethereum\u2019s average 20-30 TPS. Solana\u2019s is around 2,500 TPS and some of the newer, Ethereum-centric layer-2 blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrum can do 65,000 and 40,000 TPS, respectively.\n\nThe Parallel Stack can do around 5,000 TPS, but is aiming to hit 10,000 TPS by the end of the year, Jog said.\n\nSei, of course, isn\u2019t the only one working to make Ethereum faster and cheaper. Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, an \u201cEVM equivalent\u201d layer-2 blockchain, does an average of 2,000 TPS. But they use different design philosophies and Sei\u2019s focus is on higher throughput through parallel processing, said Jeff Feng, Sei Labs co-founder, previously an investor at Coatue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a stove; you can cook two things at the same time, as opposed to one dish then another,\u201d Feng said. \u201cHistorically if you wanted that kind of TPS, you needed to build on Solana and learn a brand new development framework.\u201d\n\nBut if Sei is building its own layer-1 blockchain, not derived from Ethereum, why would it be working to solve Ethereum\u2019s problem? Because Ethereum is where most developers are and scaling is a problem they think they can also address. And if Sei can offer them a way to adopt parallel processing to improve their Ethereum work, they could also learn core tenets of Sei\u2019s ecosystem along the way.\n\nPlus, they don\u2019t see the two blockchains as competitors. \u201cOur goal is to scale the EVM. There has been significant interest to have parallel EVMs and this is a natural next step: democratizing access to make it as plug and play as possible,\u201d Jog said.\n\nSo perhaps it makes sense that Sei is honing in on the EVM space, to reach a majority of the blockchain developers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost been a no-brainer but it clearly unlocks a level of performance and throughput that allows for applications much larger to successfully build and stay on Ethereum,\u201d Feng said. \u201cWith parallelization, it will bring the industry forward.\u201d\n\nBut why would they freely share their work as open source projects? Sei\u2019s framework isn\u2019t the first to do it, but holds true to the ethos many crypto projects have of providing open code for anyone to build with.\n\n\u201cI was at Robinhood when the GameStop saga happened; a small number of people were making decisions and we didn\u2019t know anything until the news came out,\u201d Jog said. The lack of internal transparency made him want to build a decentralized chain that is open sourced, so anyone can access it and it\u2019s not limited to a group of people.\n\nJog and Feng anticipate initial excitement for The Parallel Stack to come from existing Ethereum-focused applications that are hitting bandwidth issues and are looking for higher TPS options."

        "title": "Dencun Upgrade Goes Live, Ushering in New Era for Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun upgrade went live Wednesday morning without a hitch, ushering in a new chapter for the blockchain that is poised to substantially lower transaction costs across Ethereum layer-2 networks and massively expand the blockchain ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\nJust before 10 a.m. EST, the Dencun upgrade was successfully implemented. It will now take a period of about a month or two for settlement contracts across all layer-2 networks to incorporate the update. Once they do, gas fees on layer-2 networks should immediately fall by 75%, Terence Tsao, a developer of Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, previously told Decrypt.\n\nScreenshot of Ethereum Foundation YouTube livestream\n\nLeading up to the hard fork, Ethereum developers held a livestream on YouTube to discuss the different Ethereum Improvement Proposals that would be rolling out as Dencun went live and explain some of the new terminology, like blobs\u2014which are a new way to organize and send data on the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the upgrade went live, ASCII art of a blob appeared on the screen.\n\nEthereum has undergone multiple flashy upgrades in recent years, including the 2022 merge, which transitioned the network to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model, and 2023\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked tens of billions of dollars worth of ETH staked with the network for withdrawal. But several developers who help build Ethereum believe that Dencun is poised to change the network to a degree never before seen.\n\n\u201cI think that this upgrade will have the biggest effect for users of all the Ethereum upgrades yet,\u201d Marius Van Der Wijden, an Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. \u201cDencun is a much bigger update than Shanghai.\u201d\n\nNot only will Dencun drastically cut transaction costs on layer-2 networks; it will also, by doing so, redefine the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s capacity to process massive swathes of transactions, and thus lower barriers significantly for moving projects, transactions, and data on-chain.\n\nDavid Silverman, VP of Product at Polygon Labs, previously analogized to Decrypt that Dencun will single-handedly expand Ethereum from a country backroad into a four-lane highway, in terms of the efficiency and ease with which the ecosystem will soon be able to process unprecedented amounts of on-chain traffic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGas costs might drop so low following Dencun that they will be covered by crypto companies and projects going forward\u2014essentially making such fees a thing of the past, Silverman added.\n\nSuch an unprecedented shift in the economics of Ethereum would come at a time when gas fees on the network's mainnet have recently spiked to near-unusable highs. That fact isn't lost on Dencun's developers.\n\n\"We are focused on scaling and reducing fees in L2 at a time when Ethereum's usage is reaching high volumes again and gas fees are a noticeable cost to most users,\" Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon told Decrypt.\n\nKey to Dencun's near-elimination of gas fees is proto-danksharding, a novel method for data storage on Ethereum introduced by Dencun. Proto-danksharding, which utilizes features called \u201cblobs,\u201d will allow layer-2 data to be stored on-chain temporarily for a period of about a month. Until now, data could only be stored on Ethereum forever, an immensely expensive option that greatly limited what data was uploaded on-chain.\n\nDevelopers hope that Dencun will usher in a new chapter for Ethereum, one in which there are essentially no limits\u2014related to cost, storage, or anything else\u2014on the amount of data that can exist on-chain. Such a landscape could revolutionize the types of projects and tools built across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI hope Dencun will unlock new use cases that were not possible before,\u201d Ethereum\u2019s Van Der Wijden said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building this for short-term unsustainable gains, but for long-term sustainable growth.\u201d"

        "content": "Some Ethereum layer 2 networks have seen their median transaction fees decline by as much as 99% after the Dencun upgrade went live. These are some of the biggest winners.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade\n\nThe much anticipated Dencun upgrade has led to a significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum layer 2 networks, with the effects of the immediate scalability already taking shape across the ecosystem.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade went live early on Wednesday after it activated on the Ethereum mainnet at epoch height 269568. The upgrade introduced the highly anticipated proto-danksharding functionality via EIP-4844, which integrates off-chain \u201cdata-blobs\u201d that decrease the costs associated with storing transaction data.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 networks, which are designed to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing transactions on the underlying blockchain, were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade. Data from a Dune dashboard created by \u201c@Marcov\u201d shows that popular layer 2 networks such as Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Zora and zksync have seen massive declines in their average transaction fees.\n\nAt the time of writing, median transaction fees had dropped to $0.05 on Optimism, $0.064 on Base, $0.5 on Arbitrum and $0.16 on zkSync Era. So far, Optimism and chains based on Optimism\u2019s tech stack such as Base, have seen the biggest reductions in fees.\n\nWe love to see it. OP Chains have the most affordable decentralized L2 transaction fees after 4844, bringing us that much closer to the reality of seamless end-user experiences. \u2728In Blobs We Trust\u2728 pic.twitter.com/WOovhcZelk \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 14, 2024\n\nafter 2 years of hard work, blobs are now live on @base before: $0.31\n\nafter: $0.00 (but actually $0.0005) wallets need to update to handle these cost reductions! pic.twitter.com/solIX9D4HM \u2014 Jesse Pollak (jesse.xyz) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@jessepollak) March 14, 2024\n\nStarknet, another Ethereum Layer 2 solution, posted a screenshot of the change in its transaction fees on X showing that a single gas transaction had declined 99% since the Dencun upgrade synchronized.\n\n\u201cDencun is both the most complex fork we\u2019ve shipped since the Merge, and tied for \u2018most total EIPs in a fork\u2019 with Byzantium. There were more teams than ever involved in the process, and it somehow all worked out smoothly,\u201d said the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Tim Beiko on X."

        "title": "Blobs, MSTR and more: This is Ethereum\u2019s broadband moment - Blockworks",
        "content": "The internet turned 35 earlier this week, and it seems only fitting that Ethereum would undergo arguably its largest upgrade ever just one day later.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork went off mostly without a hitch on Wednesday. Its arrival delivered a bevy of nine improvement proposals, with the blob-centric EIP-4844 being by far the most memeable.\n\nFor more than a decade after Tim Bernes-Lee (himself a dabbler in NFTs) first conceived the World Wide Web, internet users languished inside a slow, cumbersome internet plagued by bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\nDial-up modems could only handle up to about 50 kilobytes per second. The platforms we now take for granted \u2014 YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and TikTok \u2014 were as unfeasible back then as high-frequency trading on many layer-1 DEXs are today.\n\nThe arrival of broadband in the early 2000s immediately 10x\u2019d consumer-grade internet to 512 kb/sec. Impossible ideas could now be realized into billion-dollar dot-com powerhouses, radically overhauling the dynamics of our culture and turning us all terminally online.\n\nNow, two decades later, TV is all but dead, replaced by a gamut of streaming services. AR headsets backed by hyper-fast wireless blend our physical worlds with the same digital space that Bernes-Lee laid out in his 1989 paper outlining the web.\n\nWhat broadband did for the internet, blobs are now doing for Ethereum.\n\nBlobs give the raft of layer-2s their own space through which to post transactions to the Ethereum mainnet without clogging up the blockspace intended for other users.\n\nThey have their own fee market, which means regular folk and their protocols of choice won\u2019t have to compete with rollups and sidechains for blockspace \u2014 leading to lower fees for all involved.\n\nDencun and its blobs have already massively reduced fees for the layer-2s that have adopted the new rules. For example, Optimism and Base fees are down to a fraction of an American penny per transaction compared to nearly $1 before the fork.\n\nYouTube debuted in 2005, a half-decade after the rollout of the first consumer-grade broadband services. Justin.tv, the precursor to Twitch, came two years later.\n\nIt could be that layer-2 fees rise over time as more layer-2s compete for blobspace. The true impact of Ethereum\u2019s successful push toward a cohesive and holistic multi-chain ecosystem, powered by \u201cblobband,\u201d probably won\u2019t be felt for years to come.\n\nBut the groundwork has now been laid. Welcome to Ethereum\u2019s blobband era.\n\n\u2014 David Canellis\n\nData Digest\n\n\ud83d\ude43 Solana has flipped Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum for total value locked (TVL) to become the fourth largest DeFi ecosystem \u2014 a first since November 2021.\n\n\ud83c\udf0a A quarter of a billion dollars was liquidated on centralized exchanges over the past 24 hours, 60% longs.\n\n\ud83e\udd2a Memecoin mania puts Solana number-one for DEX volume over the past day \u2014 $1.45 billion to BSC\u2019s $1.14 billion\n\n\ud83d\ude34 All quiet on the crypto front as BTC hovers around $73,000 as ETH sits just below $4,000.\n\n\u270bNo budge in the benchmarks: S&P and the Dow were flat during the pre-market trade. That\u2019s no surprise, considering the VIX\u2019s drop to 14 from its long-term average of 20.\n\n\u2705 Good news: A bull market with a high VIX tends to spell \u201cbubble trouble\u201d \u2014 so lower volatility with higher prices may be a boon for traders.\n\nIs the SEC in the crypto market\u2019s rear-view mirror?\n\nThe crypto pump is upon us.\n\nSOL is up 18% this week and almost 50% over the month. Binance\u2019s BNB and Filecoin are each up more than 80% over the past 30 days. Wormhole\u2019s Portal Bridge has facilitated more than $113 million in transfers from Ethereum to alt chains like Solana, Sui, and Arbitrum over the past week.\n\nHas the market forgotten that in the eyes of the SEC, they are all securities? Probably. Or maybe traders are just confident that Coinbase and Binance will emerge victorious in their legal battles with the regulator.\n\nIn June 2023, the SEC filed back-to-back lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities, among other things. The regulator named 13 cryptocurrencies available on Coinbase and ten that trade on Binance securities \u2014 despite none of these issuers being named co-defendants in the cases.\n\nThe SEC has also not filed any individual lawsuits against these alleged security token issuers, opting to take a different approach than it did in 2020 when it sued Ripple over its XRP token \u2014 a suit that ultimately did not play out in the regulator\u2019s favor.\n\nBoth cases are still playing out in the legal system, and you might remember the SEC was notably absent from the Department of Justice\u2019s historic $4.3 billion settlement with Binance back in November.\n\nBut if you look at token prices, you\u2019d think the SEC had dropped the cases.\n\nCoinbase and Binance are both waiting for rulings in their motions to dismiss their respective cases. If the suits are not fully dismissed, the exchanges will move on to the discovery process.\n\n\u2014 Casey Wagner\n\nCan\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop?\n\nAfter offering an oversubscribed round where MicroStrategy (MSTR) raised nearly $800 million in senior convertible notes \u2014 mind you, they initially sought to raise $600 million before upsizing to $700 million last week \u2014 the company has proposed another $500 million in convertible notes.\n\nMSTR could, all-in-all, raise around $1.3 billion from its convertible notes offerings to fund its bitcoin purchases.\n\nWhile this represents a new approach to the same tactic we\u2019ve seen from MSTR in the past, Michael Saylor\u2019s firm might have found a way to ensure that the stock remains more attractive than the bevy of bitcoin ETFs on the market today.\n\nBy the numbers: MSTR has about $48 million in cash on hand as of December, but it has roughly $15 billion worth of bitcoin at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to note that while the company may spend that cash on hand, MicroStrategy appears to largely plan to add to its BTC hoard. The stock was around before the bitcoin ETFs, and so far, it looks like it won\u2019t only stick around, but may even outperform.\n\nCompare IBIT and MSTR, for example. MSTR is outperforming BlackRock\u2019s ETF even as the two go head-to-head over who holds the most bitcoin.\n\nMSTR\u2019s bitcoin buying spree has proven to be a win-win for them: Wall Street\u2019s happy and, more importantly, the crypto crowd goes bonkers when the company announces a new buy. And, trust me, the company is always announcing new buys. This year alone, MSTR has bought nearly 16,000 bitcoin.\n\nAdding to that, when bitcoin\u2019s price rockets, so does the company\u2019s stock. The company, at the end of 2023, was trading around $680. Now, the stock is getting close to $2,000 \u2014 up 200% in the last three months alone.\n\nSuffice to say, Saylor and MSTR keep hodling. The company isn\u2019t afraid to hit the buy button \u2014 even if it means raising some debt to do so \u2014 and the most recent debt offerings show that the company\u2019s appetite remains ravenous.\n\n\u2014 Katherine Ross\n\nThe Works\n\nWelcome to The Works \ud83d\udc4b Your daily slice of crypto (and not-so-crypto) from around the Web. \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Bakkt against the wall?

        "title": "Dencun Upgrade: Ethereum's Leap into the Future of L2 Scalability is Here - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with Ethereum, you know its mission \u2013 to be scalable, secure, and decentralized. As Ethereum's popularity has surged, so too have the demands on its network, raising gas fees and highlighting its scalability challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2 solutions, Ethereum's answer to the scalability problem, enabled handling transactions off the main chain without compromising its core principles. Still, gas prices on L2 \u2013 lower, but not yet low enough \u2013 remain a barrier to Ethereum\u2019s widespread adoption. Imagine finding an NFT collection you like, only to discover that the transaction will cost nearly as much as the NFT itself! Even on L2, this scenario is all too common.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, March 13, 2024, this is all going to change!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about the day? Well, the next Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, is scheduled for activation, as announced during Consensus Layer Call 127 and confirmed by Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDencun is poised to be a game-changer for Ethereum's scalability. Encompassing a hard fork involving Deneb (Consensus layer) and Cancun (Execution layer) upgrades, Dencun promises to usher in a new era of affordability for transactions on Ethereum L2s. With the upgrade already live on devnets and testnets like Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky, and Mainnet readiness confirmed, we finally stand on the brink of a gigantic leap forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most anticipated changes is the introduction of off-chain data blobs via Proto-Danksharding. Let\u2019s explore what this entails for Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnveiling Blobs and Proto-Danksharding\n\nData blobs are a novel concept designed to optimize L2 transaction data storage on Ethereum. Currently, rollups store their data in transaction calldata . It\u2019s not only limited in size but is also stored forever, creating a problem of always-rising requirements for running a validator.\n\n\n\n\n\nProto-Danksharding , as introduced by EIP-4844 , lays the groundwork for an innovative, dramatically more efficient data handling mechanism, addressing the limitations of current on-chain data storage. With data blobs, specifically designed to handle large amounts of data outside the main Ethereum blockchain, rollups will be able to store data in a more cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new storage solution for rollup transactions will reduce the rate of future Ethereum data growth, contributing to a leaner and more efficient network. For developers, this brings the ability to create more complex and data-intensive smart contracts without being hindered by prohibitive gas costs. For users, it translates into lower fees, making L2-based applications more accessible and appealing to a wider audience. Finally, it also allows Ethereum Validator Node Operators to optimize disk space usage as blobs are pruned after around 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expected Effect of the Dencun Upgrade on the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nSeveral key players in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as OP Labs and the zkSync team, have provided quantitative insights into the expected benefits of this upgrade. OP Labs forecasts an extraordinary 20x reduction in gas costs for data storage on Ethereum by Optimism L2. Similarly, the zkSync team anticipates a tenfold decrease in gas costs for data storage, projecting the total gas costs on zkSync to drop from an average of $0.20 per transaction to under $0.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these projections highlight dramatic savings in data storage costs, it's important to keep in mind that the overall gas costs experienced by users involve multiple factors beyond L1 data storage. The Proto-Danksharding upgrade, by reducing the rate of future Ethereum data growth, addresses a crucial aspect of transaction costs. However, the actual effect on user transaction fees will vary, as these fees also depend on computational complexity, network congestion, and other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Dencun: The Road to Full Danksharding\n\nAs you can see, the Dencun upgrade is indeed a crucial milestone for Ethereum. Yet, it is only the first step on a much larger, bolder path towards full Danksharding. This future phase in Ethereum's evolution is set to massively boost the network\u2019s transaction processing capability and efficiency. Imagine a blockchain that can smoothly process more than 100,000 transactions per second. Yes, that's where we're headed!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned above, Proto-Danksharding sets the groundwork by integrating off-chain data blobs and reducing the cost of L2 data storage on Ethereum. The full Danksharding expands on these principles, aiming to increase the maximum amount of blobs per block from 16 to 64. This transition does not just mean an increase in data storage efficiency but a fundamental re-architecture of how blocks are processed and validated across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move towards full Danksharding will require several significant technical and operational changes:\n\nProposer-Builder Separation : This mechanism separates the roles of proposing blocks and building blocks within the network. Dealing with a large amount of blobs per block would be too tasking for a single builder+proposer, so the duties will be separated. Additionally, this change will reduce the risk of censorship or manipulation by preventing proposers (validators) from being influenced by the contents they're including in a block.\n\n\n\nData Availability Sampling: To ensure data within shards remains available, DAS allows nodes to verify the availability of shard data without needing to download the entire shard. This technique is crucial for maintaining blob data integrity and accessibility efficiently across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the Future of Ethereum!\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a pivotal milestone for Ethereum, marking a major leap forward in its evolution. This upgrade not only promises to elevate the platform's efficiency and L2 transaction affordability but also lays the foundational steps toward the much-anticipated transition to full Danksharding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we transition into this transformative phase, it's imperative for the Ethereum community, including developers, investors, and enthusiasts, to remain informed and actively contribute, thus ensuring a seamless evolution of the ecosystem. Engaging across forums, chats and social media, as well as participating in development projects, enriches our collective journey towards realizing a more efficient, inclusive, and forward-thinking blockchain platform for all."

        "title": "Deep Dive Into Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade - LCX",
        "content": "Understanding Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade\n\nThe highly anticipated Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade is a hard divergence that signifies a substantial turning point in the continuous development of the Ethereum network. By capitalizing on the achievements of prior enhancements, including the recent Shanghai upgrade, Dencun endeavors to implement significant security, usability, and scalability improvements. This section will provide an in-depth analysis of the upgrade, examining the significant improvements and features that Ethereum stakeholders and enthusiasts can anticipate.\n\nCancun: Scalability Improvements- The Cancun enhancement primarily targets the Ethereum network\u2019s execution layer. The document presents a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that aim to optimise gas efficiency and scalability. One noteworthy EIP is EIP-1234, which ensures a seamless transition to Ethereum 2.0 by modifying the block reward and delaying the \u201cdifficulty bomb.\u201d\n\nDeneb: Enhancing Security and Consensus- The Deneb upgrade is specifically designed to improve the security and consensus mechanisms of the Ethereum consensus layer. An essential EIP is EIP-2322, which introduces a more robust and efficient enhancement to the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nEIPs Finalised for Implementation- The Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade integrates a number of finalised EIPs that are now slated for deployment. These consist of:\n\nEIP 1559: This proposal (EIP-1559) presents a novel fee framework with the dual objectives of enhancing user satisfaction and diminishing transaction charges. The implementation of a dynamically adjusting base fee in response to network demand streamlines the process of fee estimation and mitigates congestion.\n\nEIP-2929: This EIP fortifies the Ethereum network\u2019s security by augmenting the expenses associated with specific operations. As a result, malicious actors will find prospective attacks more costly to execute.\n\nEIP-2537: It presents a novel opcode tailored for Ethereum, which streamlines the verification process of elliptic curve signatures by contracts. This improvement enhances both privacy and scalability.\n\nExpected Benefits- The Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade provides the Ethereum ecosystem and its users with tremendous potential. The objective of the upgrade is to furnish developers and end-users with a more streamlined and intuitive experience through the resolution of scalability concerns, optimization of gas efficiency, and reinforcement of security measures. Furthermore, it establishes the groundwork for forthcoming developments and facilitates Ethereum\u2019s shift towards a consensus mechanism that is entirely PoS.\n\nImplementation and Timeline- It is anticipated that the Cancun-Deneb Upgrade will take place in the future months, although an exact date has not been specified. By actively working on the deployment and testing procedures, the Ethereum community and developers are minimizing potential network disruptions and ensuring a seamless transition.\n\nTherefore, the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade signifies a substantial advancement for the Ethereum blockchain. By prioritizing scalability, security, and usability, this upgrade endeavors to tackle significant obstacles and grant Ethereum and its thriving ecosystem access to fresh prospects.\n\nWhat Is the Concept of Proto-Danksharding?\n\nOne of the notable developments in the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade is the implementation of danksharding and proto-danksharding. These technologies are designed to enhance the efficacy and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain. The aforementioned concepts are elaborated upon in the article titled \u201cEverything You Need to Know Regarding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade.\u201d\n\nDanksharding\n\nThe concept of partitioning the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, more manageable segments known as \u201cblobs\u201d is referred to as Danksharding. The objective of the upgrade is to augment the capacity of the Ethereum network and diminish transaction fees through the implementation of danksharding. By enabling parallel processing of transactions and smart contracts, this partitioning method increases throughput and scalability.\n\nProto-Danksharding\n\nA feature proposed for the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade, proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) expands upon the notion of danksharding. It augments the functionality of danksharding by generating supplementary storage capacity for data on the Ethereum network. The augmented storage capacity facilitates the processing of substantial volumes of data in a more streamlined manner, thereby augmenting scalability.\n\nThe implications of proto-danksharding implementation for layer-2 rollups are substantial. Expanding the storage capacity for data structures is anticipated to result in a decrease in gas expenses linked to the utilization of layer-2 solutions, thereby providing Ethereum users with a more economical and uninterrupted experience.\n\nBy implementing danksharding and proto-danksharding, the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade effectively tackles a significant obstacle that the Ethereum network currently encounters: scalability. These advancements enable the network to process a greater quantity of transactions and smart contracts, thereby promoting the expansion and acceptance of decentralized applications (dApps) constructed on the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn light of the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem, danksharding and proto-danksharding symbolize pivotal measures in the pursuit of Ethereum\u2019s overarching scalability objectives. Through enhanced transaction efficiency and capacity optimization, the upgrade establishes the foundation for a more scalable and sustainable Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade to Focus on \u201cBlobs \u201d\n\n\u201cBlobs\u201d refers to the partitioned sections of the Ethereum blockchain in the context of danksharding and EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding). The objective of danksharding is to partition the Ethereum blockchain into more manageable blobs, wherein each blob is specifically designed to execute transactions and smart contracts. These discrete blocks operate as autonomous segments within the wider Ethereum network. Danksharding establishes parallel processing by dividing the blockchain into blobs, which permits the concurrent execution of numerous transactions and smart contracts.\n\nAs previously stated, proto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, expands upon this notion by incorporating supplementary storage capacity for data within individual blobs. The augmented storage capacity facilitates the incorporation of a greater quantity of data, including smart contract code, transaction data, and related metadata. By augmenting the storage capacity, proto-danksharding facilitates the more streamlined management of increased data volumes within individual blobs.\n\nThere are numerous advantages to employing clusters in danksharding and proto-danksharding:\n\nEnhanced Scalability: By partitioning the blockchain into smaller chunks, parallel processing is enabled, which increases the capacity of the Ethereum network to process a greater number of transactions and smart contracts. This enhanced scalability contributes to the reduction of transaction fees and congestion.\n\nEnhanced Resource Allocation: Through the partitioning of the blockchain into autonomous entities, resources including storage capacity and processing power can be allocated in a more streamlined fashion. Blobs can be configured to execute particular smart contracts or process specific categories of transactions, thereby optimising the allocation of network resources.\n\nFlexibility and Modularity: The flexibility and modularity of the Ethereum network are enhanced through the utilisation of containers. This feature facilitates the modification or elimination of blobs in response to the changing requirements of the network, thereby enabling the smoother integration of future scalability enhancements.\n\nIn its entirety, the implementation of blobs in danksharding and proto-danksharding furnishes the Ethereum blockchain with a more streamlined and expandable structure. Danksharding endeavours to facilitate the expansion of storage capacity within individual blobs, thereby augmenting transaction processing velocity, diminishing transaction fees, and bolstering the development of decentralised applications on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Recap"

        "content": "A recent phishing attack has left a crypto investor reeling from a loss of 501 ETH, valued at approximately $2 million, staked through liquid restaking protocol Ether.Fi.\n\nOn-chain data reveals that the theft occurred earlier today and involved two transactions. In one transaction, 426 ETH were siphoned, followed by another 75 ETH in a subsequent transaction. At the time of the attack, these stolen assets were valued at roughly $1.6 million and $276,000, respectively.\n\nAs a result of the theft, the wallet\u2019s net worth plummeted by over 99.93%, leaving them with only $1,453.\n\nScam Sniffer, a Web3 security platform, identified the attack as utilizing an \u201cIncreaseAllowance\u201d transaction, a signature commonly associated with phishing schemes that enable attackers to access funds without the victim\u2019s authorization.\n\nOver $100 million lost to phishing scams\n\nThis incident occurs amidst a surge in phishing scams targeting the industry this year.\n\nAccording to data provided by Scam Sniffer, $104 million was defrauded from approximately 97,000 crypto users in the initial months of this year due to phishing attacks. In January, losses amounted to $57.7 million, followed by $46.8 million in February.\n\nA breakdown of the attacks shows that Ethereum users bore the brunt, losing $78 million in assets, including ETH and ERC20 tokens.\n\nThe primary method employed by cybercriminals involved duping victims into signing malicious phishing signatures, such as \u201cUniswap Permit2\u201d and \u201cincreaseAllowance,\u201d which enabled the malicious players to gain unauthorized access to their victims\u2019 funds.\n\n\u201cMost of the thefts of all ERC20 tokens were due to assets being stolen as a result of signing phishing signatures such as Permit, IncreaseAllowance, and Uniswap Permit2,\u201d Scam Sniffer explained.\n\nScam Sniffer revealed that most victims fell prey to deceptive comments on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter). The attackers often masquerade as legitimate crypto organizations to lure unsuspecting individuals to phishing sites where their digital assets are stolen."

        "content": "Ethereum's Dencun upgrade cuts layer 2 fees by up to 98%.\n\nInitial adoption of the \"blobs\" transaction format under the Dencun upgrade is progressing, with key layer 2s starting to integrate this cost-saving feature.\n\nThe long-term effects of Dencun on the Ethereum mainnet's congestion and transaction fees remain uncertain, despite immediate benefits for layer 2s.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live yesterday, lowering fees on top layer 2 networks by as much as 98%.\n\nDencun is a series of nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIPs. The most important is EIP-4844, which dramatically cuts the costs of interacting on layer 2 networks.\n\nAlthough it went live yesterday at 1:55 pm London time, it took some time for layer 2s to integrate Dencun, and some still have yet to implement it.\n\n\u201cLayer 2 operators are tasked with updating their systems to accommodate the new data posting method introduced by the upgrade\u201d Marianna Angelou, an analyst with digital asset risk-management firm Metrika, told DL News.\n\nIn the hours following the highly anticipated upgrade, only two layer 2 networks, ZkSync and Starknet, adopted the new data posting method, which uses \u201cblobs.\u201d\n\nBlobs present a novel transaction format for Ethereum, distinguishing between everyday user transactions on Ethereum\u2019s main network and those initiated by layer 2 networks.\n\nThis concept can be likened to a highway system, where layer 2 networks enjoy the advantage of a dedicated lane, while the rest of the users navigate the shared main highway.\n\nAs activity increases on this digital highway, meaning more transactions occur on Ethereum, congestion can build up, leading to higher gas, or transaction, fees. Layer 2 networks, however, remain unaffected by that congestion, thanks to their exclusive access to a private lane.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOther top layer 2 networks such as Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum have enabled blobs on their chains as of today.\n\nThe median transaction costs for layer 2 networks Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and ZkSync are now only $0.026, $0.027, $0.051, and $0.108.\n\nThat comes out to a reduction in transaction costs of 96%, 95%, 95%, and 65%, respectively.\n\nThe median transaction cost in USD for seven layer 2s (growthepie)\n\nThe largest reduction in cost belongs to Starknet. Just before it enabled blobs, the median transaction cost was about $1.35, and now, the median transaction cost is $0.0196 \u2014 a 98% decrease.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to make it easier and cheaper for developers to build applications that were previously too costly due to high operational expenses,\u201d Angelou said.\n\nOne such example of this is with Overtime Markets, a sports-betting protocol on Optimism. Its founder said that if gas prices remain as low as they are after Dencun, Overtime Markets will have three times as many markets for users to bet on.\n\nBut some argue it may still be too early to make any assumptions. Some layer 2s, like Blast, have yet to enable blobs, and as more layer 2s start to use blobs, the fees could increase.\n\nAlthough blobs provide layer 2s with a dedicated lane for posting transactions, that lane could also become congested over time. As the number of layer 2s using blobs increases, they may find themselves competing for access to the same exclusive lane.\n\nWhat about the Ethereum mainnet?\n\nWhile transaction fees on layer 2s dropped significantly, transaction fees on Ethereum mainnet remain elevated.\n\nAlthough the upgrade was designed to lower transaction fees on layer 2s, it may help lower fees on Ethereum mainnet, as well.\n\n\u201cBy eliminating the need for L2s to compete for mainnet block space, we expect this upgrade to reduce demand pressures on the mainnet in the short term\u201d Angelou said.\n\nNow that layer 2s have their own dedicated lane for transactions, it will naturally free up more room on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLayer 2s accounted for about 13% of transactions on Ethereum mainnet in the last 30 days.\n\nPrice history for Ether over the last 30 days\n\nIn the 30 days leading up to the upgrade, Ether rallied 44%, but since the upgrade went live, Ether is down 5.08%, falling to $3,776.\n\nGot a tip about DeFi?

A key impact of this major upgrade will be to reduce fees on the network, helping to ease congestion and improve scalability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dencun upgrade brings on several changes, the most notable of which is the implementation of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, known as \"protodanksharding,\" which will help cut L2 transaction fees and thus usher in a new era of Ethereum scalability.\n\nDencun activated! First block is in! \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) March 13, 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum community celebrated the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, a major ETH transfer caught the market's attention. A whale, an individual or entity holding large amounts of cryptocurrency, deposited 15,000 ETH on crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nThe deposit of such a large amount of ETH to exchange typically indicates a potential sale; thus, this unexpected move has led to speculation and intrigue within the crypto community, particularly as it coincides with the launch of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a whale unstaked 15,078 ETH worth $60.3 million and deposited it with Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nA whale unstaked 15,078 $ETH($60.3M) and deposited it to #Binance and #Bitfinex, possibly selling to repay the debt.\n\n\n\nHe has a debt of 110M $DAI on #Spark and the health rate is 1.57.https://t.co/vSj2NxgglN pic.twitter.com/enFn91xckD \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 13, 2024\n\nWhat makes the move quite unusual is that the Dencun upgrade is expected to act as a positive catalyst for the ETH price, which leads to speculation about the whale's confidence in the upgrade's immediate impact on the market.\n\nHowever, this might not be, as Lookonchain speculates that the whale may possibly be selling their ETH holdings to repay the debt. The whale has a debt of 110 million DAI on Spark and a health rate of 1.57.\n\nCrypto data tracker, Whale Alert reports significant ETH movement before and at the Dencun upgrade launch. A total of 10,132 ETH worth $41,011,423 was transferred from an unknown wallet to Kraken exchange.\n\nHours before the Dencun upgrade launch, 18,560 ETH worth 75,324,186 were transferred from Binance to an unknown wallet. A total of 244,550 ETH worth $992,516,261 and 50,000 ETH worth $202,898,923 were also moved between unknown wallets, as well as other large transactions.\n\nAs the dust settles, the community eagerly watches to see the Ethereum Dencun upgrade's potential impact on the market and the ETH price, which remains largely unknown."

Developers had some fun and uploaded the script of Jerry Seinfeld's B movie on Ethereum as gas fees plunged after the latest upgrade, Ethereum D kon upgrade has significantly reduced data fees allowing for the scripts to be posted at a much lower cost than it would have been before developer Dan Clark posted on paradigm quote. I didn't get the first blob but as far as I can tell, I did get the first B movie on main net and quote. The transaction costs only about $14. Blobs are a cheap way to temporarily carry data about transactions that are now possible after Wednesday's upgrade. A report from Bernstein says that Robinhood will benefit from the monster crypto cycle. The research and brokerage firm initiated coverage of Robin Hood with an outperform rating and $30 price target. The broker expects the total crypto market cap to reach $7.5 trillion by 2025 versus 2.6 trillion today, noting that this means Robin Hood crypto revenue should grow ninefold. Bernstein expects Bitcoin's market cap to grow to $3 trillion and ether is to increase to 1.8 trillion by 2025. And according to Franklin Templeton's digital assets team meme coins exhibit a strong correlation between their price surges and the growth of user wallets on the underlying blockchains. Despite lacking inherent value propositions, the traditional finance giant added in a report that such tokens may provide investors with opportunities to make quick price profits and have gained virality in the past year due to their unique nature. The report found active addresses on various Blockchain networks grew in tandem with a surge in meme coin trading activity on those specific chains.

        "content": "While in the United States there is a debate about the feasibility of the SEC approving the spot ETF on Ethereum, in Hong Kong it is taken for granted that the regulated investment product will first appear on Chinese exchanges.\n\nAccording to some reports from local Eastern media, it seems that the monetary authorities of Hong Kong are starting to consider introducing this kind of exchange traded fund in the markets.\n\nIn the USA, the deadline for potential approval or rejection is May 23rd: given the concerns raised by President Gensler regarding the financial nature of Ethereum, speculation is beginning to arise that the ETF will be rejected in this initial round.\n\nWho will win first? The States or Hong Kong?\n\nEverything you need to know below.\n\nDeadline for the Ethereum spot ETF in the USA set for May 23: heading for rejection?\n\nAfter the approval in January of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the USA, Ethereum investors expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to soon open the doors to regulated investments on Nasdaq for the second most capitalized cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nRegarding this controversial topic, the feelings of those working in the cryptocurrency markets are currently in opposition, with some arguing that the ETF for ETH is imminent and others counteracting by saying that we are too early, but soon we will have the definitive answer.\n\nThe Bloomberg Intelligence information portal, directly picking up data transmitted by the SEC, recently reported the updated deadlines for the final response of the US federal entity, which precisely on May 23, 2024 will have to express its opinion on the approval or possible rejection of the Ethereum ETF presented by VanEck.\n\nThe next day it would be the turn of Ark Invest, and in the following weeks other Fund Managers who have previously applied for the investment product such as Hashdex, Grayscale, Invesco, BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nAlthough until a few days ago almost all the actors active in the cryptographic landscape agreed that the success of Bitcoin ETFs in America would necessarily push the SEC to approve the same type of fund for Ethereum, now things seem to be slightly different.\n\nOn March 8th, in fact, the President of the US market surveillance agency Gary Gensler expressed his hesitation regarding the need for an exchange traded fund for Ethereum in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nGensler, among other things, is not yet able to definitively express what the financial nature of Ethereum is and whether it should be classified as an unregistered security.\n\nThese uncertainties could lead to a rejection by the SEC in such a hectic moment of the market.\n\nAnyway, we remember that even when discussing the same topic on the Bitcoin front in 2023, Gensler and his henchmen had raised similar doubts, casting doubt on the usefulness of decentralized currency.\n\nEthereum spot etf approval deadline is in 2 months and Gary Gensler still won\u2019t answer if eth is a security pic.twitter.com/WccLR2wL7W \u2014 Crypto Tea (@CryptoTea_) March 8, 2024\n\nThe uncertainty conveyed by the words of the SEC chief then spilled over into investors\u2019 projections, who in the decentralized forecasting market Polymarket quoted a 30% approval of the regulated financial product by the end of May.\n\nIn January, the chances of acceptance had even doubled compared to current values, around 60%, driven by the euphoria for investments in Bitcoin.\n\nMost experts agree that this time we will not see the long-awaited Ethereum ETF in the United States, but we will have to wait for potential future developments and new deadlines.\n\nProbability chart of approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum ETF could land in Hong Kong before the United States\n\nDespite uncertainties currently driving the narrative of the Ethereum spot ETF within the United States territory, a much more optimistic atmosphere can be felt in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to a local Chinese media report, then reported by the well-known reporter \u201cWu Blockchain\u201c, Chinese monetary authorities are starting to consider an ETF for the second cryptocurrency in the market, as well as examining some questions for the same type of product on Bitcoin.\n\nChinese cryptographic experts believe that the need to relaunch the Hong Kong stock market after the sharp slowdown in recent years will be the key condition that will push for approval of regulated investment vehicles on Ethereum before a positive outcome in the USA.\n\nLocal media in Hong Kong reported that 10 financial institutions have planned to apply to launch Bitcoin spot ETFs in Hong Kong, and Ethereum spot ETFs are under discussion. The industry said that if ETH products can be launched earlier than the United States, Hong Kong will have\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2024\n\nGiven the results achieved by US Fund Managers in recent days, which are attracting attention and desire in the minds of American investors, a similar product for Ethereum listed exclusively on Chinese exchanges could bring a significant flow of trading volumes to the eastern yang.\n\nRegarding the possibility of an early listing compared to Western stock exchanges, Weng Xiaoqi, COO of HashKey Group, stated verbatim that:\n\n\u201cThe delayed launch of spot ETFs by six months also means that it will take another six months for US capital to enter the market. At that point, it will have to face higher purchase costs and entry points, and will have to bear the risk of being tied up by US capital.\u201d\n\nHong Kong, if it were to make this delicate decision, could obtain the status of Asia\u2019s financial hub surpassing its American competitors and attracting significant capital in a moment of strong optimism for speculations.\n\nObviously all this would have a decidedly positive impact on the price of ETH, which, going through a phase of strong demand and contraction on the supply side, could soar in the market reaching new all-time highs around $5,000 in the coming months."

Figures reveal its rise to power, surpassing Ethereum on several fronts: daily activities, NFTs, stablecoins, etc. Vitalik Buterin and his team must step up their efforts to not lose their lead against this emerging rival.\n\nSolana: The New Queen of Blockchain?\n\nBut is the confidence of Solana\u2019s developers justified in their ambition to compete with Ethereum despite their youth? Observers remain skeptical of this fierce battle, where Solana is gaining ground on Ethereum\u2019s weaknesses (notably gas fees), while showing signs of vulnerability with its recurring outages.\n\nThe fight between these two cryptocurrency giants promises to be long and intense according to CoinTurk. Because in the kingdom of cryptocurrencies, Solana is carving out a prime spot for itself. According to the latest data, it outperforms its competitors by becoming the leading blockchain in terms of payment volumes over the past six months. With transactions totaling $1.7 trillion, Solana exceeds Ethereum ($1.1 trillion) and Tron ($869 billion).\n\nThe growth in liquidity on the Solana network is also stimulating the activity of DeFi protocols, making the platform more attractive. A new record for monthly transactions was set, while the number of daily active users now exceeds 800,000, reaching an unprecedented level.\n\nThis increased liquidity not only facilitates decentralized exchanges but also attracts DeFi projects in search of solid performances and abundant liquidity.\n\nSolana\u2019s ability to process a large number of stablecoin transactions promotes its global adoption, thus offering efficient and cost-effective financial services to users and developers.\n\nDespite its rise, Solana, the issuer of the SOL cryptocurrency, still has to catch up with Ethereum in terms of total value locked (TVL) on the network, closely followed by Tron.\n\nIn the realm of NFTs, Solana is also seeing its popularity rise with a significant increase in the total floor value of its collections. While Solana is shaping up to be a major player in the world of cryptocurrencies, the road to total supremacy is still fraught with challenges.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Today, at 13:55 UTC, or more precisely at block 8626176 of the Beacon Chain, the Dencun hard fork upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain was successfully executed.\n\nIts implementation combines two specific upgrades, known as Deneb and Cancun, where the first essentially concerns the consensus layer, while the second refers to the execution layer.\n\nDencun marks a milestone for the world\u2019s most well-known smart contract platform, and introduces improvements that could be remembered for a long time in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nBelow is everything you absolutely need to know.\n\nDencun kicks off: the long-awaited update of the Ethereum blockchain is successfully executed\n\nAfter the Shapella update dated April 2023, which started the unstaking of previously locked ETH within the Beacon Chain, Ethereum now concludes another fundamental chapter of its existence by inaugurating the Dencun hard fork.\n\nThis kind of substantial protocol change comes after the same renewal procedures have been tested on the Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky testnets, sometimes encountering quite a few difficulties.\n\nTechnically, Dencun combines two other updates that occur simultaneously on the consensus and execution levels of Ethereum (Deneb + Cancun).\n\nSeveral projects revolving around the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Optimism, Starknet, Arbitrum, and many others, have celebrated in synergy the ongoing technological revolution.\n\nThe @Ethereum ecosystem is on the brink of a game-changing upgrade with the Dencun release, featuring EIP-4844. \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 8, 2024\n\nIts implementation among the various clients operating on the network is designed to improve scalability, which remains the Achilles\u2019 heel of the infrastructure designed by Vitalik Buterin even after years.\n\nOne of the most significant changes introduced with Dencun is, in fact, the introduction of the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d designed within the \u2018EIP-4844 with the aim of reducing layer-2 fees, anticipating the future revision of \u201csharding\u201d.\n\nThe update completed today, however, adds many other infrastructure improvements, celebrating various Ethereum Improvement Proposals such as EIP-1153, EIP-4788, EIP-5656, EIP-6780, EIP-7044, EIP-7045, EIP-7514, and EIP-7516.\n\nThe work of Ethereum developers, who have been planning for years to shape the protocol by adding innovations that will improve scalability, has finally been completed even though it arrived after some delay in the original schedule that saw Dencun being launched in 2023.\n\nHowever, despite encountering small hiccups along the way, the entire cryptographic community of Ethereum definitively closes the door on a brilliant era in the history of smart contracts and opens a gateway that projects us directly into the future.\n\nMany fans and active members of the ecosystem such as EthStaker and Nethermind validators, took the opportunity to celebrate together the milestone reached, joining in a livestream with their audience.\n\nWARNING: the update of the clients will happen automatically based on the provider you are relying on. Whether you are a LST staker or a simple holder, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\n\nIf, instead, you are only a staker (and have locked 32+ ETH on the Beacon Chain) you absolutely must update both the execution layer and the consensus layer, otherwise risking continuous slashing of the staked ether.\n\nThe advantages brought by Dencun to the world of layer-2: a small step towards danksharding\n\nAs mentioned, the Dencun update brings substantial benefits in terms of Ethereum scalability, introducing the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d within layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon ZkEVM, zkSync, Starknet, and many others.\n\nIn this phase, which anticipates the future implementation of sharding, with which the work of the blockchain will be fragmented, the so-called \u201cblobs\u201d have been introduced\n\nThe BLOBs are data storage spaces (as well as a new type of transaction), that replace the traditional pointers to calldata.\n\nThe blobs can be described as smaller partitions of the Ethereum database that allow to manage specific data segments improving the overall efficiency of the chain.\n\nThis translates into a significant reduction in gas costs incurred by various L2 rollups in the cryptographic ecosystem and greater transaction scalability.\n\nIt is estimated in this regard that in the coming days, when all second-level chains have updated their sequencers, the milestone of 100,000 tp/s on Ethereum will be reached.\n\nRegarding saving on fees, projections indicate a cost reduction of almost 5 times compared to the original price required to carry out an operation.\n\nWe remind you that, unlike what is erroneously described by less experienced people, the cost of transactions on the main layer remains UNCHANGED, while the advantage will be exclusively on layer-2\n\nThe much-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade is set to go live today at 13:55 UTC, bringing blob transactions and transient storage, and reducing costs on Ethereum's layer-2 networks via EIP-4844.\ud83e\uddbe pic.twitter.com/unHY8Pa6KV \u2014 Moby Media (@mobymedia) March 13, 2024\n\nAs we approach the full version of sharding with this kind of compromise improving the experience for the end user in the Ethereum rollup ecosystem, the Dencun update marks another huge advantage.\n\nIndeed, the proto-danksharding will also benefit the class of data availability (DA) protocols such as Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail, helping networks store large amounts of data at reduced costs.\n\nIn this regard, we emphasize how L2 consistently use DA projects to store their on-chain data. Dencun could make it much cheaper to move large amounts of information, opening the doors to a phase of expansion for this niche.\n\nRegarding the success of the Ethereum hard fork and the milestone achieved in the context of DA, Polygon\u2019s co-founder, Jordi Baylina, stated the following in an interview with Coindesk:\n\n\u201cPrices should go down mainly because it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand. Your supply is higher, the availability of data on Ethereum will be higher, so the price should go down.\u201d\n\nAlthough we still do not know to what extent savings could occur, we can certainly affirm that Ethereum blockchain developers will be much freer to build smoothly, without thinking too much about technical hitches caused by data costs and network fees in rollups.\n\nNow the limit for creating successful protocols on Ethereum is only imagination: the future has arrived, and it looks brighter than ever."

        "content": "The Dencun upgrade significantly reduces costs for Layer 2 transactions, fostering a massive shift towards these networks.\n\nDencun stands as the most monumental update since The Merge, driving Ethereum towards its scalability and efficiency goals.\n\nBinance\u2019s recent update highlights the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, formally known as EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding, as a pivotal enhancement aimed at elevating the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability, security, and user experience. Set to go live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024, this upgrade will facilitate a higher transaction throughput, thereby addressing one of Ethereum\u2019s longstanding challenges.\n\nFollowing the overview, it\u2019s pertinent to note that this development aligns with CNF\u2019s prior analysis, Time is Running Out to Buy Cryptos Before the Ethereum Dencun Update, signaling a crucial juncture for investors and users within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe upgrade, also referred to as the Cancun upgrade, signifies a major leap in enhancing the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s efficiency and scalability. By introducing proto-dank sharding, it lays a foundation for more affordable transactions and improved data management, setting a precedent for a smoother and more inclusive user experience.\n\nOutlined in a Business Insider publication, the Dencun upgrade encompasses five essential innovations:\n\nCost Efficiency: A drastic reduction in Layer 2 transaction fees is anticipated, potentially leading to a widespread transition of operations to these networks. This approach could also see projects absorbing gas fees as a strategic move to attract users. Significant Milestone: Representing the most notable update since The Merge, Dencun pushes Ethereum towards achieving its ambitious goal of supporting a myriad of rollups and scaling mechanisms, ultimately aiming to process millions of transactions per second. Introducing Proto-Danksharding: This upgrade brings to light a method proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2019, focusing on a novel approach to data storage. It aims to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and efficiency by optimizing how data is temporarily stored. Etymology: Named after researchers Dankrad Feist and Proto Lambda, this feature sets the groundwork for Danksharding. It signifies a strategic deviation from traditional sharding techniques, indicating a forward-thinking approach to scaling Ethereum. Groundbreaking Ceremony: The establishment of Proto-Danksharding was marked by the largest \u201cTrusted Setup\u201d ceremony in 2022, a collective effort pivotal for the upgrade\u2019s success. This initiative underscores the community\u2019s involvement in Ethereum\u2019s continuous evolution.\n\nAmid these significant upgrades, ETH has also seen notable activity, with a 0.39% increase over the last 24 hours and a 7.06% jump in the past week, reaching a price of $4,037. This highlights the vibrant and ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

Similarly, the average cost of transaction on Coinbase\u2019s Layer-2 Base has also plummeted to $0.196 from $1.212 within the same timeframe.\n\nAdditionally, zkSync\u2019s average fee has dropped to $0.162 from a daily high of $0.546, while Zora network\u2019s transaction cost also fell from $0.752 to $0.003.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the reduced transaction fee trend is dominant across L2 networks that have implemented blobs.\n\nThe average transaction costs on L2 networks that are yet to implement the upgrade have remained the same. For instance, Arbitrum falls within this category, as its average transaction cost has fluctuated between $0.65 to $0.84 over the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the high fee on Arbitrum would soon be a thing of the past, as the team behind the network plans to integrate with Dencun improvements today.\n\nBlobs are finally on Ethereum, here's an update on Arbitrum support! 1\u20e3 Tomorrow, all Arbitrum rollup chains can start to see lower fees as a result of Dencun x ArbOS Atlas upgrade. 2\u20e3 March 18th there will be additional fee reductions for Arbitrum One, as per ArbOS Atlas. \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) March 13, 2024"

        "content": "Ethereum prices soared even though it lacked the demand from ETFs that Bitcoin has.\n\nProfit-taking activity as ETH crosses $4k could commence, according to the age-consumed metric.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] accumulation addresses were at 171% and 80% unrealized profit respectively, according to data that CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn the past three months, Bitcoin saw enormous institutional demand due to the ETFs. While Ethereum does not have ETFs, it still saw strong demand.\n\nBitcoin witnessed a faster rate of accumulation than Ethereum\n\nThe inflows to accumulation addresses, in USD terms, have rapidly gained pace for Bitcoin in 2024. The ETF approval in January had a huge impact on this metric.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was unable to match the pace of demand for Bitcoin.\n\nSimilarly, the whale addresses holding Bitcoin saw a sharp uptrend since 2021. This has only sped up even more in 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw a more steady uptrend since 2021 without sudden bursts of acceleration.\n\nEven without institutional demand to the same degree as Bitcoin, Ethereum was able to hold its own in terms of demand and popularity. It underlined that whales still saw the largest altcoin as a safe alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nRealized price refers to the price of the Bitcoin or Ethereum at which they were last moved on average. The accumulation addresses were at 92.5% unrealized profits on Bitcoin, and 183% unrealized profits for Ethereum.\n\nThis highlighted an especially bullish case for Ethereum. Demand on the scale that Bitcoin is witnessing right now could propel ETH prices into the stratosphere, which should have investors jumping for joy.\n\nExamining the accumulation trends across the network\n\nAMBCrypto looked at the wider BTC and ETH network activity to contrast CryptoQuant\u2019s dive into the accumulation addresses. The Santiment data above showed that the daily active addresses of ETH were about half that of Bitcoin since early February.\n\nThe Ethereum age-consumed metric saw a huge spike on the 11th of March when the prices burst past the $4k psychological resistance. This pointed toward profit-taking activity.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nOn the other hand, the mean coin age of ETH has trended upward over the past four months. In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s mean coin age has fallen since the second half of February.\n\nOnce again, this suggested that holders were booking profits on BTC, while they were mostly happy to let Ethereum run higher. Despite this inference, the large age-consumed surge warranted some caution from investors."

The upgrade is designed to usher in a new era of cheaper fees for the growing array of auxiliary networks that operate on top of Ethereum known as layer two roll ups. The DK upgrade has been planned for years but it was delayed due to some engineering concerns. Since then, developers have tested the package on three separate networks and most of those ran smoothly. Ether is at just below $4000 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. And the US government has concluded that no NFT specific legislation is needed. A 112 page government study found that current intellectual property laws are adequate to deal with concerns about copyright and trademark infringement associated with FTS.

        "content": "Ethereum price prediction threatens a major tailspin after the successful mainnet launch of the Dencun Upgrade. The second-largest cryptocurrency briefly climbed to $4,087, testing its recent highs ($4,087) on Wednesday before sliding below the previous day\u2019s open of $4,008.\n\nTrading at $3,955 on Wednesday, ETH price has sustained a 2.5% drop in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is down 20% in the same period, hinting at declining interest among traders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith a market cap of $477 billion, Ethereum comfortably sits in the second position below Bitcoin\u2019s $1.4 trillion cap.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: What\u2019s Next After Dencun Upgrade\n\nEthereum finalized the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet following three successful testnet launches. The landmark upgrade goes beyond introducing new features, it stands out for reducing fees on layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum \u2014 and is expected to spur growth.\n\nAs reported, \u201cblobs\u201d another key feature of the upgrade, brings to life a new locale to store data on the blockchain. This special space is isolated from standard transactions, attracting lower costs.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, is the biggest protocol improvement in a year, with Ethereum expected to significantly change the scaling landscape where layer 2 protocols will benefit the most.\n\nLayer 2 networks are preparing to incorporate \u201cblobs\u201d in their operations \u2014 a move likely to spark a pricing war. Arbitrum announced on X that it was ready to jump on the new data storage space in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe blobs have arrived on Ethereum! \ud83d\udc21 The Dencun upgrade has successfully launched on Ethereum mainnet making it one of the biggest upgrades to support Layer 2\u2019s in scaling Ethereum. Now with the Ethereum mainnet upgrade complete, we expect the ArbOS Atlas upgrade to be\u2026 \u2014 Arbitrum (\ud83d\udc99,\ud83e\udde1) (@arbitrum) March 13, 2024\n\nContrary to expectations, the Dencun upgrade was not a significant market mover. If anything, sell-side pressure quickly erased the move to the recent highs around $4,093.\n\nBased on the four-hour chart, Ethereum price has flipped below the important $4,000 level as well as the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nA neutral and downward-slopping Relative Strength Index (RSI) backs the correction as ETH searches for fresh liquidity.\n\nSeveral four-hour candle closes below $4,000 might accelerate the pullback. With the next major support at the 50-day EMA, investors should prepare for instability below $3,900.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on the retracement to maximize returns in the bull market, there is no need to fret as Ethereum price will stay bullish as long as it holds above the Ichimoku cloud levels.\n\nThe black line on the chart backs the uptrend as long as it is respected as support. In that case, a carefully executed dollar-cost average strategy would give traders many opportunities to buy the dip thus eventually contributing to new momentum above $4,000.\n\nA good place to start buying ETH is the short-term support at $3,950. However, if the decline continues below $3,900, the 50-day EMA (the line in red on the chart) might ignite a new bullish fire toward all-time highs.\n\nEthereum might run into considerable congestion in the range between $3,963 and $4,083. About 1.64 million wallets bought ETH at an average cost of $4,027, implying that they may want to sell at their respective breakeven levels, damping the uptrend.\n\nThe IOMAP model developed by IntoTheBlock points to robust support between $3,605 and $3,725. With approximately 835k addresses buying 4.11 million Ether in the range at an average price of $3,679, traders have a rough idea of how far down they can DCA if ETH price continues to fall.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Announces Ethereum's Upcoming Milestones: Verkle Trees and History Expiry Rebeca Moen Ethereum's network takes a major leap in scalability with the completion of the \"Basic rollup scaling\" milestone, paving the way for verkle trees and history expiry.\n\nThe Ethereum network has reached a critical milestone in its scalability roadmap with the successful implementation of \"Basic rollup scaling,\" according to an post by Vitalik Buterin on Warpcast. This development is a key component in Ethereum's transition to a more scalable and efficient blockchain, which is essential for its long-term success and adoption.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nFollowing this milestone, the Ethereum development community is setting its sights on the integration of verkle trees and history expiry. Verkle trees are an evolution of Merkle trees that will enable more efficient and compact proofs, reducing the amount of data validators need to store. History expiry is a concept that will allow old transaction data to be removed, thereby reducing the \"state bloat\" and making it easier for users to run full nodes.\n\nIntroducing \"Basic Rollup Scaling\"\n\nRollups are solutions that execute transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) and post transaction data back to it. This \"Basic rollup scaling\" is the foundation that allows for increased throughput on the network while maintaining security by leveraging the main chain for data availability and consensus.\n\nThe Promise of Verkle Trees\n\nLooking ahead, the Ethereum development team is focusing on the integration of verkle trees. Verkle trees are a proposed upgrade to the existing Merkle trees, which are data structures that enable the secure and efficient verification of content in a blockchain. Verkle trees will optimize storage and computational efficiency, significantly reducing the size of proofs and making it easier to run an Ethereum node.\n\nUnderstanding History Expiry\n\nAnother forthcoming feature is history expiry, a mechanism that will allow the Ethereum network to shed older historical data, thus preventing excessive growth of blockchain data size. This will alleviate the burden on nodes, ensuring that the requirement for storage space does not become a barrier for validators and full node operators, which in turn contributes to the decentralization and robustness of the network.\n\nCommunity Reactions and Expectations\n\nThe announcement received a positive response from the Ethereum community, with many expressing excitement and support for the progress. Vitalik's update on Warpcast garnered 1728 reactions and various comments from key players in the Ethereum ecosystem. Brian, from @br1an.eth, extended an invitation to discuss the update on the @unlonely platform, indicating a strong interest in the implications of this development.\n\nThe Future of Layer 2 Scaling Solutions\n\nQuestions about the timeline for Layer 2 solutions adopting new features like blobs, a form of data storage that could further reduce fees, were raised by community members such as Hugo Montenegro (@hmheck). The anticipation for more affordable transaction costs was palpable, with users like Pacheco (@pachec0) expressing concerns over the current fee structure.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum network's latest accomplishment in achieving the \"Basic rollup scaling\" milestone has generated enthusiasm among stakeholders and users alike. As the community looks forward to the implementation of verkle trees and history expiry, the path towards a more scalable and user-friendly Ethereum continues to unfold.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "ETH might face mild resistance but a climb to $5,000 looked almost certain.\n\nRising confidence in the altcoin reinforced the bullish prediction.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] might soon hit $5,000, according to analyst Ali Martinez. But the altcoin has to break through the supply wall between $4,522 and $4,646.\n\nA supply zone is a cumulation of buy orders. In this instance, the intention is to create a barrier that prevents the price from going down. Martinez, who used IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, noted that 600,000 addresses bought 1.63 million ETH around that region.\n\nThe season is already here\n\nTherefore, the path was now a resistance for the cryptocurrency as some of the buyers might try to breakeven. While this might slow down Ethereum\u2019s bullish strides, the climb to $5,000 looked almost certain.\n\nAMBCrypto came to this conclusion after analyzing the Liquidation Heatmap. In simple terms, the Liquidation Heatmap predicts price levels where large-scale liquidations might occur.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, liquidation occurs when a trader\u2019s position is forcefully closed due to price fluctuations. It could also happen as a result of insufficient margin balance to cover the funding fee.\n\nFrom our analysis of HyblockCapital\u2019s data, large scale liquidations might occur if ETH hit $4,205. However, a successful close above this price could see the value climb higher.\n\nFor instance, the chart below showed that the altcoin might not face any major resistance below $4,310. Furthermore, if ETH rises past 4,860, the run to $5,000 could become very easy.\n\nBearish aggression is fuel for ETH\u2019s rally\n\nAnother metric AMBCrypto assessed to check the likelihood of a rally was the Funding Rate. The Funding Rate is the difference between the price of a perpetual contract and the spot price of a cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s aggregated Funding Rate was 0.068%. The positive Funding Rate implied that ETH was trading at a premium perp price above the index value.\n\nThe high reading of the metric alongside the rising ETH price suggests that short are aggressive. Unfortunately, their aggression is not being rewarded. Therefore, ETH\u2019s price action is potentially bullish.\n\nBeyond the happenings in the derivatives market, we also checked out the active addresses. At press time, the number of active addresses on the Ethereum network was 537,000. This was a significant increase from what the amount was on the 10th of March.\n\nThe rise in active addresses indicate growing interest and confidence in ETH. While it also means that the network has gotten healthier, traders might also view it as bullish signal.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIn conclusion, a combination of the metric evaluated aligned with a price increase. However, ETH might experience some pullback as it targets a new all-time high.\n\nBut indicators showed that potential retracement might not last long."

ETH is now approaching a major support at $3,500 where the bulls might take a stand.\n\nEthereum started a downside correction from the $3,080 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,850 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its increase if it clears the $3,850 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Dips\n\nEthereum price failed to stay above the $4,000 resistance zone and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $3,920 and $3,850 support levels to enter a short-term bearish zone.\n\nIt even spiked below the $3,680 support zone. A low was formed at $3,625 and the price is now consolidating losses. It seems like there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,850 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEthereum price is now trading below $3,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

Any more gains might call for a test of $4,150.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,850 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,680 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,600 zone. The next key support could be the $3,500 zone. A clear move below the $3,500 support might send the price toward $3,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,600\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,850"

        "content": "Stablecoin volumes on Solana grew significantly over the last six months.\n\nDaily activity on the Solana network surged while floor value of Solana NFTs spiked.\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed a large uptick in interest in its ecosystem over the last few weeks. This has led to a large surge in stablecoin volumes on the network as well.\n\nVolumes on the rise\n\nAccording to recent data, Solana became the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers at the time of writing, surpassing other chains in settlement volumes over the last six months.\n\nDuring this period, Solana recorded $1.7 trillion in transactions, outpacing Ethereum with $1.1 trillion and Tron with $869 billion.\n\nThis heightened liquidity within the Solana ecosystem not only facilitates smoother decentralized exchange operations but also attracts decentralized finance (DeFi) projects seeking a platform with robust performance and ample liquidity.\n\nThe network\u2019s ability to process a substantial number of stablecoin transactions enhances its overall adoption, as users and developers are drawn to a blockchain that offers efficient and cost-effective financial services.\n\nMoreover, the diverse use cases supported by high stablecoin volumes, including trading, lending, and yield farming, contribute to a dynamic and active Solana ecosystem.\n\nLooking at the activity\n\nIn terms of daily activity, Solana surpassed Ethereum and was slowly catching up to Tron. However, in terms of TVL (total value locked) on the network, it was seen that Ethereum reigned supreme followed by Tron and Solana.\n\nThis showed that despite a surge in activity, Solana has a long way to go before it could go toe to toe with Ethereum in the DeFi sector.\n\nNFT metrics\n\nIn terms of the NFT sector, it was seen that Solana NFT collections witnessed growth. The overall total floor value of Solana NFTs surged significantly over the last few days.\n\nHowever, the same level of growth wasn\u2019t observed in terms of sales volume for these collections. This indicated that despite the rising prices of the NFT collections, the number of NFT trades remained low implying that many addresses were choosing to hold their collections instead of trading them.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $150.93 and its price had grown by 1.75% in the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the volume at which SOL was being traded at had also grown by 15.23% during the same period.\n\nHowever, the RSI at which SOL was trading had declined suggesting a slowdown in bullish momentum."

The primary focus of the upgrade is to drastically reduce fees to aid Layer-2s growth.\n\nThis will be made possible as the developers will activate a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), which is named proto-danksharding.\n\nEthereum\u2019s fees spike\n\nWhile developers prepared to push the new upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s network fees increased.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Artemis\u2019 data revealed that ETH\u2019s fees gained upward momentum and spiked on the 5th of March. As a result, ETH\u2019s revenue also rose on the same day.\n\nA possible reason behind this surge could be the hike in ETH\u2019s gas price, which stood at 64.39 Gwei per Ycharts.\n\nThough things looked optimistic in terms of captured value, Ethereum\u2019s network activity had dropped. This was evident from the decline in its Daily Active Addresses chart since the 29th of February.\n\nBecause of the drop in addresses, ETH\u2019s Daily Transactions fell as well.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum\u2019s price action favored the bulls, as it was up by more than 9% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,034.42 with a market capitalization of over $484 billion.\n\nThe king of altcoins also remained a buzzing topic of discussion in the market as its Social Volume remained high.\n\nAdditionally, its Weighted Sentiment spiked, suggesting that bullish sentiment around the token was dominant at press time.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nApart from that, the technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish upper hand in the market. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered an uptick, hinting at a further rally.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands at press time, which indicated a price correction."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s wallet address is experiencing an unprecedented surge to an all-time high, according to data from The Block\u2019s data dashboard. Notably, the blockchain has recorded more usage, specifically non-voting user transactions, than several major competitors combined. Solana\u2019s activity surpasses that of Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Tron, and Avalanche collectively. This remarkable milestone highlights Solana\u2019s growing prominence and widespread adoption in the blockchain space.\n\nDespite SOL still being 70% away from its previous ATH, the blockchain is attracting massive institutional interest. For instance, Pantera Capital, a major player in the crypto space, is reportedly considering a substantial investment of $250 million in SOL from FTX. This move is seen as a strong bullish signal for the blockchain.\n\nSolana's Wallet Surge Surpass Ethereum & Beyond 3\n\nEven with FTX holding 10% of the circulating supply, equivalent to $8 billion, industry insiders suggest that this might be the beginning of potential growth. With influential companies like Pantera expressing confidence in higher SOL prices, investors are paying attention, and following their lead could potentially lead to substantial gains.\n\nKeeping up the momentum, the Solana meme coin market is booming with a nearly $7 billion valuation, representing around 10% of the total market. Ryan Selkis of Messari highlighted Solana\u2019s standout features, such as a seamless trading experience highlighted by tools like Phantom and Backpack, DEXscreener trading integration, minimal fees, and rapid transaction processing. In a market cluttered with speculative tokens, these elements collectively distinguish the blockchain, setting it apart from the rest.\n\nSolana: Blockchain Powerhouse\n\nThe platform\u2019s appeal is not limited to its advanced functionalities but also to its cost-effectiveness.

        "title": "SuperRare Expands Beyond Ethereum NFTs Into Bitcoin Ordinals Artwork - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum NFT marketplace SuperRare is making the jump to Bitcoin with the launch of a new collection of Ordinals inscriptions by the artist Killer Acid, the platform announced Thursday.\n\nSan Diego-based SuperRare is a platform for art creators and collectors backed by the Ethereum blockchain. It specializes in single-edition, 1-of-1 digital works and is one of the longest-running platforms in the NFT world.\n\nSuperRare partnered with Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace Gamma to bring inscriptions to the platform. While SuperRare did not specify the size of the collection coming April 11, 2024, \u201cNo Brainers\u201d will continue that trend on Bitcoin and only feature 1-of-1 inscriptions, meaning each piece of art in the collection will be unique, with each Ordinals inscription having a unique image.\n\nKiller Acid is the brainchild of artist Rob Corradetti, whose work often trades in psychedelic themes. Artwork from \"No Brainers\" has yet to be revealed as of this writing; the image above is derived from an Ethereum NFT piece that Killer Acid minted on SuperRare in 2022 called \"Crypto Art.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"When I first discovered Ordinals last year, it was still in its infancy\u2014all of the setups were manual and required trust. Initially, this turned me off,\u201d Zack Yanger, SVP of SuperRare Labs, told Decrypt in an email.\n\nYanger said that towards the end of 2023, he took time to dive further into the Ordinals ecosystem and came to understand that there has been \u201ccutting-edge development\u201d in the space since the protocol launched at the start of last year. Substantial infrastructure has been built in the Ordinals space since then.\n\n\u201cAt SuperRare, we are always looking for new ways to support our artists in creative ways. After receiving significant inbound interest from our artist community, we\u2019re excited to begin experimenting with Ordinals,\" Yanger said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the number one network for NFTs based on trading volume, Bitcoin is heating up as another key place to mint digital artwork and collectibles thanks to the Ordinals protocol launched last year. In fact, Ordinals trading is starting to shake up the market share standings, recently pushing cross-chain marketplace Magic Eden to the top of the list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to bring more artists home to Bitcoin,\u201d Bitcoin NFT marketplace Gamma co-founder Nick Sainato told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cBuilding in the programmable Bitcoin ecosystem since 2021, it\u2019s been truly exciting watching the unprecedented market and mindshare that has been ushered in by Ordinals over the past year,\u201d he added. \u201cSupporting SuperRare\u2019s entry into Bitcoin has been an honor, as one of the early teams who laid the groundwork for digital assets and established much of the appreciation for fine art on-chain.\u201d\n\nLast year, SuperRare entered the NFT royalties debate, with SuperRare co-founder Jonathan Perkins saying the platform will continue to pay artists a share of secondary market sales after many rival platforms stopped enforcing them.\n\n\u201cWe took a fairly controversial move at the time to include artist royalties. What we said is that if we can help artists make any money through royalties, why not try, at least? So we played some part in establishing some kind of a standard, at least for the art side,\u201d Perkins told Decrypt during NFT Paris 2023. \"Royalties are not going away on SuperRare.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Ethereum Rainbow Chart March 2024 Update and How to Read It? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Confused by the ever-changing price of Ethereum (ETH)? The Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be your guide! In 2024, this chart has become an essential tool for both novice and seasoned investors navigating the volatile landscapes of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThrough this update, we delve into the nuances of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, offering a step-by-step guide on interpreting its colors and patterns. Moreover, we will uncover where Ethereum stands on this chart as of March 2024.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a vibrant visualization tool designed for long-term predictions of Ethereum\u2019s price movements. Inspired by the Bitcoin (BTC) Rainbow Chart, it combines a logarithmic growth curve with color bands to easily depict Ethereum\u2019s different market sentiments and valuation phases.\n\nThis approach facilitates the observation of exponential growth in cryptocurrency values, which might not be as perceptible on a standard linear scale.\n\nThe working of a Rainbow Chart\n\nLogarithmic scale: The chart uses a logarithmic scale, which shows proportional relationships in the data rather than absolute changes. This is useful for assets like Ethereum that can experience rapid price increases.\n\nColor bands: Each color band represents a different market condition, from \u201cbuy\u201d zones to \u201csell\u201d zones. The colors can also be seen as sentiment indicators, from fear at the bottom to greed at the top. The idea is to counteract emotional investment decisions by providing a visual cue.\n\nDynamic adjustments: Lastly, the chart adjusts as new price data becomes available, potentially shifting the regression model and the positions of the color zones.\n\nBeginner\u2019s guide to reading the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to interpret Rainbow Charts, here\u2019s a general guide to help you navigate it:\n\n1. Dark red zone (maximum bubble territory)\n\nThis extreme area signals that the asset is highly overvalued, and the risk of a significant correction or crash is elevated. Selling and taking profits in this zone could be wise to protect against potential losses.\n\n2. Red zone (overbought)\n\nThe red zone suggests that Ethereum is in an overbought condition. This means that the price has been pushed to levels that may not be sustainable in the near term.\n\nIn traditional market analysis, an overbought condition is often followed by a price correction as traders start taking profits, leading to an increased supply of ETH for sale.\n\n3. Dark orange zone (FOMO building up)\n\nIn the dark orange zone, buyers are dominating the market, and a sense of fear of missing out (FOMO) is building up. This indicates an intense buying pressure where new investors are entering the market.\n\nWhile this can lead to short-term price surges, it also increases the risk of a sudden market correction if sentiment changes or early investors start cashing out.\n\n4. Light orange zone (balanced market)\n\nThe light orange zone suggests that the forces of supply and demand are relatively even, leading to more stable prices. In a balanced market, neither buyers nor sellers have clear dominance, and the price of Ethereum moves within a more predictable range.\n\nThis stability can be seen as an opportune time for investors to reassess their positions without the pressure of extreme volatility. It might also indicate a period of consolidation before the next significant price movement.\n\n5. Yellow zone (hold)\n\nThe yellow zone implies that while there might not be strong signals to buy more ETH or to sell existing holdings, maintaining one\u2019s position could be advantageous in the long run.\n\nIt\u2019s a watchful wait stance, where investors keep a close eye on market developments without making immediate, drastic changes to their portfolios.\n\n6. Light green (still cheap)\n\nIn the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, the light green zone signifies a phase where ETH is considered relatively cheap. This zone indicates that the price is lower than the historical average, potentially offering investors a favorable entry point before an anticipated increase in value.\n\n7. Green zone (buy)\n\nOften considered the \u201cideal\u201d zone, the green band suggests that Ethereum is fairly valued. Prices in this range are thought to offer a good balance of risk and reward for long-term investors. Buying during the green phase is often recommended for those looking to accumulate Ethereum for the long haul.\n\n8. Blue zone (undervalued)\n\nAs prices move down into the blue zone, Ethereum is considered undervalued. This zone suggests that market sentiment may be overly bearish, and prices could represent a significant discount.\n\n9. Dark blue zone (basically a fire sale)\n\nThe bottommost bands signal that Ethereum is significantly undervalued, resembling a \u201cfire sale\u201d with meager prices. They present the best buying opportunity, offering the potential for substantial long-term gains as the market recovers.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart: March 2024\n\nIn March 2024, ETH lies in a light orange zone. This suggests a balanced market. So, the decision to buy, sell, or hold depends on an investor\u2019s strategy, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of considerations for each action:\n\nBuy ETH\n\nLong-term perspective : If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in the fundamental value and future growth of Ethereum, buying during a balanced market could be a strategic move.\n\n: If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in the fundamental value and future growth of Ethereum, buying during a balanced market could be a strategic move. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): This period might be ideal for implementing or continuing a DCA strategy. Here, you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the market condition. This approach can help mitigate volatility and lower the average purchase price over time.\n\nSell ETH\n\nProfit-taking : If you have already achieved significant gains and the market\u2019s balanced state meets your target sell conditions, it might be an opportune time to realize some profits. This is particularly relevant if you anticipate increased volatility or have short-term investment goals.\n\n: If you have already achieved significant gains and the market\u2019s balanced state meets your target sell conditions, it might be an opportune time to realize some profits. This is particularly relevant if you anticipate increased volatility or have short-term investment goals. Portfolio rebalancing: The balanced market condition could be a good opportunity for portfolio rebalancing. If Ethereum\u2019s recent performance has skewed your investment portfolio away from your desired asset allocation, selling a portion of your ETH holdings to rebalance your portfolio can help manage risk.\n\nHold ETH\n\nWait-and-see approach : In a balanced market, holding can be a wise choice, especially if you are unsure about the market\u2019s direction. This strategy is suitable for investors who are not affected by short-term fluctuations.\n\n: In a balanced market, holding can be a wise choice, especially if you are unsure about the market\u2019s direction. This strategy is suitable for investors who are not affected by short-term fluctuations. Stability: If your analysis suggests that the market is likely to remain stable or improve, holding your position allows you to avoid potential transaction costs and taxes associated with selling, and you remain positioned to benefit from future growth.\n\nDecision factors\n\nMarket analysis : Continuously monitor the market for any new trends or data that might affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Use a combination of technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis.\n\n: Continuously monitor the market for any new trends or data that might affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Use a combination of technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis. Risk tolerance : Assess your risk tolerance. If potential short-term market downturns lead to uncomfortable stress levels or financial strain, adjusting your position might be prudent.\n\n: Assess your risk tolerance. If potential short-term market downturns lead to uncomfortable stress levels or financial strain, adjusting your position might be prudent. Investment goals: Align your actions with your investment goals. Whether you\u2019re investing for long-term growth, income, or speculation, let your goals guide your decision-making process.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart Use-Cases for Investors\n\nWhen considering investing in Ethereum, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be incredibly helpful. It provides insight into past price movements and potential future directions.\n\nBy analyzing different colored price ranges over time, investors can identify opportune moments to enter or exit positions. Essentially, the chart highlights areas where significant buying or selling activity is likely to occur, aiding decision-making processes regarding Ethereum investments.\n\nLimitations of Rainbow Charts\n\nLike any analytical tool, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart has its limitations. Here are some of the key limitations to consider:\n\nHistorical data dependency : The Rainbow Chart relies heavily on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future price movements accurately.\n\n: The Rainbow Chart relies heavily on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future price movements accurately. Subjectivity in color zones : The interpretation of color zones can be subjective. This can potentially lead to differing opinions on market conditions.\n\n: The interpretation of color zones can be subjective. This can potentially lead to differing opinions on market conditions. Lack of fundamental analysis : It does not incorporate a fundamental analysis of Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology, adoption rates, or other developments.\n\n: It does not incorporate a fundamental analysis of Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology, adoption rates, or other developments. Oversimplification : The chart may also oversimplify complex market dynamics.

Volatility underestimation : It might underestimate the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, leading to overly optimistic or pessimistic investment decisions.\n\n: It might underestimate the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, leading to overly optimistic or pessimistic investment decisions. No timing guidance: The chart does not guide timing, making it challenging to execute buy or sell decisions at optimal moments.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nAdvantages of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nOnce you understand how the Ethereum Rainbow Chart works, let\u2019s explore why it\u2019s such a valuable tool:\n\nAccessible Understanding: This chart offers a straightforward way to comprehend market sentiments and track Ethereum (ETH) price movements. Its use of layers and colors makes it accessible, even for those new to technical analysis.\n\nComparative Analysis: It serves as a valuable comparative tool, enabling users to analyze market trends and price levels across various cryptocurrencies. This comparison can provide insights into Ethereum\u2019s performance relative to other digital assets.\n\nPredictive Insights: Incorporating the Ethereum Rainbow Chart into your analysis can aid in predicting future price movements based on historical market cycles. Observing patterns in price behavior can provide investors with a better understanding of potential future trends.\n\nDisadvantages of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nDespite its visual simplicity and utility, there are limitations to consider when using the Ethereum Rainbow Chart:\n\nNo Guarantees: No tool, including the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, can reliably predict future prices in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. While it may provide insights into past trends, it cannot guarantee future outcomes.\n\nLimited Historical Data: Unlike the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, which extends back to 2010, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart has a more limited period. This shorter historical data may result in less accurate predictions and analyses.\n\nExternal Factors Not Considered: The chart does not account for external factors such as government regulations, economic conditions, or technological advancements. These factors can significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s price movements but are not reflected in the rainbow chart.\n\nEcosystem Changes: Changes within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as upgrades or protocol changes, are not accounted for in the rainbow chart. These developments can have substantial effects on Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics but are not captured within the chart\u2019s framework.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart and the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart differ in the price ranges they represent and their time frames. This difference is logical given Ethereum\u2019s historically lower value compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart dates back to 2010, providing a more extensive historical perspective, while the Ethereum counterpart records price performance only from 2015 onwards.\n\nBoth charts visualize historical price trends, aiding investors in identifying potential support and resistance levels. However, they should not serve as the sole basis for investment decisions, requiring additional analysis and consideration of various factors.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a helpful indicator, but remember, it\u2019s not a crystal ball. Cryptocurrency remains a volatile market. By understanding the Rainbow Chart\u2019s logic and combining it with your research, you\u2019ll be better positioned to navigate the ever-shifting world of Ethereum. So, are you ready to unlock the secrets of the Rainbow? Dive in and get charting!"

        "title": "BNB Chain set for new upgrade, follows Ethereum\u2019s footsteps - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The blockchain mentioned that the upgrade would bring blobs but in a different manner.\n\nBNB Chain registered an increase in fees generated but development activity dropped.\n\nOn the same day Ethereum [ETH] finalized the Dencun upgrade, BNB Chain announced that it was towing a similar path.\n\nAccording to BNB Chain, it intends to work on a new upgrade tagged the \u201cBEP 633\u201d over the next few months.\n\nThe BEP 633 is similar to Ethereum\u2019s EIP-4844, which has significantly reduced transaction costs on Layer-2 (L2) projects. Like the EIP-4844, BEP 633 brings blobs into the conversation.\n\nSacrifices for the cheaper route\n\nFor the uninitiated, a blob is a highly scalable type of cloud storage that compresses large data. It also eases the network verification process.\n\nBNB Chain, in its disclosure, noted that the blobs would be useful for opBNB, the L2 of its ecosystem.\n\nThe decentralized smart contract network explained,\n\n\u201cThe temporary attribute of blobs ensures they don\u2019t indefinitely consume network space, leading to lower storage costs and, consequently, cheaper gas fees for users.\u201d\n\nThis upgrade would mark the project\u2019s third major one over the last year. In 2023, AMBCrypto reported how the chain introduced Greenfield, which focused on data storage and management.\n\nopBNB also came into play around the same period.\n\nHowever, BNB Chain highlighted the difference between EIP-4844 and BEP 633. Based on its, communiqu\u00e9, blobs would be managed by the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nIt also mentioned that BSC would be in charge of the gas price mechanism and fee burn.\n\nWhen BNB Chain completes this upgrade, there is a chance that its fees and revenue might decline. At press time, Artemis\u2019 data showed that fees on the network have been jumping over the last 90 days.\n\nAttention, not development, returns to the network\n\nAt press time, fees generated by the blockchain hit $1.3 million, indicating high network activity. Despite the increase in activity on the network, BNB Chain has struggled to maintain consistency in development activity. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment data, BNB\u2019s development activity peaked on the 26th of January. A few days later, the metric was flat. It was a similar situation on the 3rd of March as the metric jumped. At press time, the development activity was flat again, indicating that code commits on the network had been fizzling. However, there was one metric that put BNB in a good light, and that was Social Dominance.\n\nSocial Dominance shows the share of discussions about a project in the media. Thus, the surge meant that BNB Chain had gotten a lot of attention lately.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BNB\u2019s market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nHowever, there could be changes in the development activity as the chain rolls out the schedule for the BEP 633 upgrade.\n\nFrom the information AMBCrypto got, the Testnet will take place in April while the Mainnet will be concluded by June."

        "title": "Ethereum Holds Above $4,000 As Dencun Upgrade Begins! Will ETH Price Trigger A Correction? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) options traders are preparing for potential short-term declines in price just one day after the price impressively surged past $4,000, reaching its highest point since late 2021. Following Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge above the $73,000 threshold, ETH has been gaining traction, aiming to maintain its position above the $4,000 mark. Nonetheless, the ongoing Dencun upgrade, a significant development subsequent to the Merge, has ignited worries about a possible retreat in ETH prices. This cautious outlook is further boosted by a variety of on-chain metrics indicating a bearish sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Sparks Bearish Worries\n\nIn the past four hours, [ccpw id=60480] has experienced a significant liquidation event totaling over $5 million, with $3.2 million of this coming from the liquidation of bearish positions by sellers. Notably, with BTC\u2019s price now affecting ETH\u2019s price dynamics, even a slight downturn could trigger a long squeeze in ETH\u2019s market. Moreover, numerous analysts anticipate a market correction for ETH following the completion of the Dencun upgrade, drawing parallels to the correction observed after the Merge.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock reveals a notable increase in the Netflow metric for ETH, with the current trading volume reaching 85.29K ETH. This indicates that the volume of Ethereum entering exchanges has begun to exceed the outflow, leading to an increase in exchange reserves. Such a trend underscores the growing likelihood of an imminent price correction in the near future.\n\nAdditionally, the one-month call-put skew for Ether, a key indicator of market sentiment in the options arena, has shifted into negative territory, suggesting a prevailing preference for puts \u2014 options that hedge against potential price declines. Similarly, the sentiment for the 60-day period has shown a tilt towards put options. In contrast, the outlook for the 90-day and 180-day periods continues to be optimistic, as per the cryptocurrency options data from Deribit monitored by Amberdata.\n\nFurthermore, alongside the adverse risk reversals, QCP Capital has observed a minor decrease in ETH spot-forward spreads, in stark contrast to the higher spreads seen in Bitcoin (BTC) markets. This disparity indicates that a significant drop in ETH spot prices might trigger an additional tightening of forward spreads as leveraged long positions undergo liquidation.\n\nHowever, the Dencun upgrade, following last year\u2019s Shapella, introduces significant enhancements to Ethereum, notably with EIP-4844, or \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d drastically reducing Layer 2 fees. It aims to lower transaction costs dramatically, from a dollar to just a cent, enhancing user experience. Additionally, Dencun brings in ephemeral data blobs to reduce storage costs and network congestion, storing data temporarily for about 18 days, thereby boosting Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nConsequently, given the current bullish market outlook, Ethereum may not see any notable price adjustments or declines from its present position. Should any pullbacks occur, they are likely to draw in further buying interest.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nSellers attempted to drive Ether down to the breakout point of $3,600, yet the pronounced tail on the candlestick indicates robust purchasing at lower prices. As a result, despite facing rejection at $4,100, ETH price quickly rebounded and is now aiming for a retest of that level. Currently, ETH price trades at $4,066, surging over 2.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour Chart On TradingView\n\nThe climb above the key $4,000 mark has set the stage for a potential increase to $4,500, which might present a slight obstacle. However, surpassing this resistance level could send the ETH/USDT pair towards $4,900.\n\nThe recent sharp rise has sent the RSI into significantly overbought territory, suggesting a need for caution. Currently, the RSI level trades at 64 level. For sellers to plunge the current bullish trend, they must pull the price beneath the 20-day EMA at $3,989. Doing so could trigger a corrective period for the pair."

        "content": "On March 13, 2024, the Dencun upgrade was finally deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. From what it\u2019s understood, the Dencun development will result in transaction charges\u2019 minimisation related to layer-2 networks, along with improvements in Ethereum\u2019s aggregate growth potential.\n\nReportedly, the Dencun upgrade name was coined by merging Ethereum consensus layer\u2019s Deneb upgrade, which implies the way a consensus is reached between network members over the blockchain\u2019s state, and Ethereum execution layer\u2019s Cancun upgrade, which helps with handling of transactions on the mentioned layer. Official data has shown that the Dencun hard fork encompasses nine separate Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). As of March 14, 2024 (4.25 pm, Indian Standard Time), at the time of writing, Ethereum was trading close to the $4,000 mark, having an approximately $476 billion worth market capitalisation and around $21 billion worth 24-hour trading volume, as stated by CoinMarketCap, a crypto price-tracking website.\n\nAlso Read Oracle adds generative AI features to finance, supply chain software\n\nThe Dencun upgrade happened almost a year post the Shanghai upgrade in April 2023, which allowed the unstaking of the Ether (ETH) token by its holders for the first time and resulted in Ethereum network clocking over 500,000 validators.\n\nAlso Read Pakistan: Who is the new ISI chief, Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik?

This long-awaited upgrade promises to revolutionize the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum network, paving the way for significant changes in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n#Traders beware! #Ethereum price may encounter turbulence ahead of #Dencunupgrade, warns QCP Capital.\n\n\n\nStay ahead, strategize, navigate wisely through the storm. Knowledge is power!https://t.co/hz9rhQp19S \u2014 Coin Edition (@CoinEdition) March 13, 2024 The price of Ethereum (ETH) could be disrupted before the Dencun update\n\nDencun Upgrade of Ethereum: A Promise of Increased Scalability\n\nAt the heart of the Dencun upgrade is the \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This is a technical innovation aimed at significantly reducing transaction costs for layer 2 blockchains.\n\nThis major advance could resolve the scalability issues currently hampering Ethereum. It would indeed allow the crypto network to potentially process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Such capacity would propel Ethereum to the status of an ideal cryptographic platform.\n\nWhat are the implications for crypto investors and developers?\n\nThe increase in transaction processing capacity and the reduction in costs generated by the Dencun upgrade could attract a wave of new developers and users towards the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis increased adoption would stimulate demand for ETH, positively influencing its price. Moreover, the upgrade could promote more diversification of the Optimism (OP) ecosystem and better availability of ZK-Rollups applications.\n\nEthereum Price: Contrasting Prospects\n\nAnalysts like QCP Capital are predicting a correction in the ETH price as the upgrade approaches. They highlight the increase in short positions on Ethereum options. This indicates some investor apprehension about a possible price drop. This trend could be explained by a desire to hedge against risks associated with altcoin investments.\n\nMarket indicator analysis also reveals mixed signals.\n\nOn one hand, the risk reversal for ETH has become negative. This suggests concern about a price drop.\n\nOn the other hand, the spot-forward spreads for Ethereum have slightly decreased. This denotes some confidence in the price stability.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $4,047.\n\nDespite short-term uncertainties, the Dencun upgrade represents a crucial milestone for Ethereum.

Ethereum (ETH), which was on a roll due to the Dencun Upgrade, dropped below the $4,000 mark after the upgrade went live last night. It remains to be seen how ETH manages to recover. Other popular altcoins \u2014 including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw a mix of minor dips and gains across the board. Memecoin dogwifhat (WIF) became the biggest gainer, with a 24-hour jump of over 32 percent.

This upward momentum is credited to the growing interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs and the impending Bitcoin halving event, which historically triggers significant price movements. There has been a steady increase in mainstream acceptance and investments from both retail and institutional investors following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Now that Bitcoin has breached the $73,000 threshold, the market eyes at the $76,000 level. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has rapidly outpaced MicroStrategy in accumulating Bitcoins, accumulating nearly 204,000 BTC within just two months of its launch, indicating a surge in demand. Blackrock's Bitcoin holdings now stand at over $14.76 billion in assets under management.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cThe global crypto market cap has reached $2.77 trillion, marking a 1.69% increase from yesterday. With another day of BTC hitting all-time highs, the fear and greed index has now moved into the extreme greed category, meaning a correction is due and sooner or later the bears are going to have a good day at the market. However, with bulls having full control of the market currently, top altcoins namely BNB and SOL have been competing for the fourth largest crypto after BTC, ETH and USDT. Yesterday the ETH Dencun upgrade went live, which will have a positive impact on layer 2 gas fee transactions. Though MATIC reached its highest price in more than a year - similar price action was not visible in OP and ARB.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) continues its upward trajectory, hitting new all-time highs amid rapid buy-ups after each dip. However, analysts suggest a cooling phase may be on the horizon as BTC has nearly doubled in price since late January without significant pullbacks. Negative bearish divergence on the 4-hour chart's relative strength index (RSI) hints at potential lower prices. Meme coins' soaring values indicate a possible pullback, with BTC trading around $73,192, up 1.40% in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cOn March 13, Bitcoin jumped to around $73,000, supported by a solid base with a pivot point at $70,013 and resistance levels between $73,824 and $79,904. Key support levels at $67,154, $64,861 and $62,192 offer a safety net against potential downside. Technical indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI) of 71 and the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at 68,547, indicate strong buying interest, reinforced by bullish candlestick patterns. A break above $72,000 could sustain the bullish trend, while a break below could prompt a re-evaluation. However, caution is advised if the price drops below $72,000, potentially signalling a shift in trend despite the current optimism.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin continues to rally after a week of record spot ETF net inflows of $1.1 billion. MicroStrategy which recently bought $821.7 million worth of bitcoin, is now raising $500 million more to buy additional Bitcoin.This price action reflects strong institutional buying and new ATHs don't take much time unlike earlier. $74,000 is the next price level to watch before it eventually hits 100,000.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Asset management firm Grayscale Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin\u2019s, Grayscale Argues\n\nAccording to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has revised its 19b-4 form for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was \u201cimportant\u201d in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\nThe chief legal officer stated in his post that investors \u201cwant and deserve access\u201d to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. \u201cWe believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm said.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe asset manager is amongst the numerous firms looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock\u2019s filing on March 4, 2024.\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.\n\nSEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval\n\nTwo US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.\n\nThe success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. @SenatorJackReed and @Senlaphonza write to the @SECGov urging:\n\n-no further ETPs for other tokens\n\n-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N \u2014 Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) March 14, 2024\n\nFollowing the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAltcoins Fall: Will Ethereum And Solana Bulls Surpass Expectations? 6 months ago\n\nA part of the letter read:\n\nRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.\n\nAs of this writing, the price of the Ethereum token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.\n\nEthereum price on a deep correction on the daily timeframe | Source: ETHUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from The Economic Times, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Number Of Ethereum Short-Term Holders Increasing \u2013 Is A Bull Rally Next? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been showing a solid performance lately, leaving investors both ecstatic and wary. The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of nearly $480 billion, recently surpassed the coveted $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2021, igniting a flurry of bullish predictions. But is this a genuine resurgence, or are we witnessing a temporary blip before a potential correction?\n\nRelated Reading\n\nLet\u2019s dissect the forces at play. Proponents of a sustained uptrend point to a confluence of positive factors. The long-awaited approval of a US-based Ethereum ETF is a hot topic, with speculation swirling that a green light could trigger a significant influx of institutional capital, potentially injecting billions into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, an event that cuts Bitcoin\u2019s mining reward in half, is expected to have a positive spillover effect on the entire cryptocurrency market, potentially propelling Ethereum further.\n\nSurge In Short-Term Ethereum Holders Signals Optimism\n\nThis optimistic outlook is bolstered by a surge in on-chain activity. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals a significant increase in the number of short-term Ethereum holders.\n\nSource: TradingView/IntoTheBlock\n\nHistorically, this trend, with its 60% monthly price surge for ETH, aligns with bull markets, signifying an influx of new users entering the crypto space and actively participating in the network. Think of it as a crowded party \u2013 the more people show up (currently approaching the highs of the last bull cycle), the livelier the atmosphere becomes (and potentially the higher the price goes).\n\nBut, there\u2019s more to the story. A closer inspection of technical indicators paints a slightly different picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) are currently hovering in overbought territory, with RSI specifically nearing the 70 mark.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $2.677 trillion. Chart: TradingView\n\nIn simpler terms, this suggests that Ethereum\u2019s price at slightly above $4,000 might be stretched a bit thin and due for a potential pullback. Imagine a jump rope competition \u2013 if you\u2019re swinging too hard and fast (like an RSI over 70), eventually you\u2019ll trip yourself up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Future: Balancing Act\n\nAdding a layer of intrigue, the sentiment among investors seems geographically divided. While the \u201cCoinbase Premium,\u201d a metric reflecting buying pressure, is thriving in the US, its Korean counterpart indicates ongoing selling activity.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Hodlers Eye Long Term: $520 Million BTC Go To Cold Storage 6 months ago\n\nThis regional disparity could be attributed to diverse market dynamics and investor preferences. Perhaps American investors, with a green Coinbase Premium, are more optimistic about the regulatory landscape surrounding crypto, while their Korean counterparts, with a red Korea Premium, are taking a more cautious approach.\n\nSo, what does this all mean for Ethereum\u2019s future? The answer, unfortunately, isn\u2019t as clear-cut as we\u2019d like. The confluence of positive factors like potential ETF approval, increased network activity with a surge in short-term holders, and a potential Bitcoin halving boost paint a bullish picture.\n\nHowever, technical indicators hinting at an overbought market and contrasting investor sentiment across regions introduce a note of caution. Ethereum is currently walking a tightrope \u2013 will it maintain its momentum or face a reality check in the form of a price correction? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nFeatured image from Pixabay, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Blasts Off! ETH Price to Hit New ATH This Week?\n\nStory Highlights The Dencun upgrade for Ethereum is here, aiming to significantly reduce transaction fees on Layer 2 networks.\n\nA key feature of Dencun is the use of \"blobs\" to store data for Layer 2 networks, reducing storage costs and congestion.\n\nHope is that the Dencun will lead to substantial improvements in transaction fees and network performance.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fans rejoice as the long-awaited Dencun upgrade finally arrives today, promising to shake up Layer 2 (L2) networks and potentially boost ETH prices beyond $4,000.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another update \u2013 it\u2019s a major milestone in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, promising significant improvements in efficiency and scalability. But how exactly will Dencun shake things up?\n\nKey Features of the Dencun Upgrade\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s Shapella upgrade, Dencun brings in several improvements to make Ethereum faster and handle more transactions. One exciting feature is the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, nicknamed \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d which aims to significantly lower L2 transaction fees.\n\nDencun\u2019s goal is to drastically reduce transaction costs, with fees dropping from $1 to just one cent. Even smaller transactions, which previously cost cents, can now be completed for a fraction of a cent. This cost reduction aims to greatly improve the user experience, surpassing previous upgrades like the September 2022 \u201cMerge.\u201d\n\nBesides fee cuts, the Dencun upgrade introduces blobs, a new way to store data for Layer 2 networks. These blobs store data for a shorter time, about 18 days, saving costs and making Ethereum more scalable.\n\nAlso Read: Top Reasons Why Ethereum Might Be The Best Bet in 2024 For Atleast 3x-5x Profits\n\nCommunity Enthusiasm and Developer Involvement\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, expressed excitement on Twitter about the upcoming arrival of Dencun. Developer engagement has been strong, with many client teams releasing Dencun-compatible versions that include important performance and stability improvements.\n\nLess than 24h before Dencun .oO!\n\n\n\nSince the announcement, many client teams have shipped performance & stability improvements.

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin praised this move, highlighting its importance for the Ethereum community.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has been activated on the @gnosischain mainnet!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc21\ud83e\udd89\ud83d\udc21\n\n\n\nNext \u27a1\ufe0f Ethereum Mainnet pic.twitter.com/S6GKhfe3TX \u2014 Gnosis Chain \ud83e\udd89 (@gnosischain) March 11, 2024\n\nFee Reductions Ahead!\n\nAdding the positive vibe, IntoTheBlock\u2019s analysis predicts significant fee reductions of at least 80% for major Ethereum Layer 2 solutions after the Dencun upgrade. Optimistic estimates indicate that fees for depositing USDC on platforms like Aave could drop to as little as $0.0091, marking a remarkable 27-fold decrease. Additionally, substantial improvements in data blob functionality are anticipated for OP stack chains.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we explore the rise in meme token speculation and how the upcoming Dencun upgrade will impact Ethereum fees.\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/xVh8pz1Pxh \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 9, 2024\n\nIs There Hope for the Future?\n\nWhile the exact impact of these changes remains uncertain, the Ethereum community is optimistic about the upgrade\u2019s potential benefits and eagerly awaits its rollout.\n\nIn summary, the upcoming Dencun upgrade is a significant milestone for Ethereum, demonstrating its commitment to scalability, efficiency, and innovation. As the activation date approaches, excitement within the Ethereum community continues to build.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF Approval Dims as SEC Stalls: What are the Odds Now?"

        "content": "Ethereum-based project, OMG Network (formerly known as OmiseGo) announced today that it has finally launched to mainnet its solution that scales Ethereum to thousands of transactions per second while simultaneously reducing transaction fees to one-third of the usual amount.\n\nOMG Network V1 Mainnet Beta, which has been in the works for three years employs the More Viable Plasma (MoreVP) specification to increase the processing capacity of Ethereum. The solution batches several transactions in a single block while charging a one-time fee.\n\nCommenting on the development, Vansa Chatkavanij, OMG Network CEO discussed how blockchain finally unlocked permissionless transactions for global ecommerce on the internet, with the Ethereum network already providing the security infrastructure for such transactions.\n\nChatkavanij added that the OMG platform will facilitate true global ecommerce, adopting the security of Ethereum while also allowing for transactions that are done at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAlongside the mainnet rollout, OMG Network also released a block explorer and a demo web wallet which allows users to enter the network.\n\nBitfinex launches USDT on OMG Network\n\nFollowing the rollout of OMG Network V1 Mainnet Beta, cryptocurrency trading platform, Bitfinex has integrated its Tether (USDT) stablecoin on the OMG network to reduce transaction times, make payments faster and also lower transaction fees.\n\nThe new integration builds on the recent usage of Ethereum and especially USDT for token exchange and will allow traders to take move their assets more quickly in the event of increased market volatility such as that witnessed in March.\n\nPaulo Arduino, Bitfinex CTO said in a release,\n\nBy migrating USDt value transfers to the OMG Network, we save costs, drive performance improvements, and relieve pressure on the root chain. This is good for Bitfinex, our users, and the entire Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nMeanwhile, news of OMG Network launching its Ethereum scalability solution follows a recent listing of the project\u2019s token on leading cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, a period that saw the coin gain 25% within 24 hours."
