Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAs the second quarter of 2024 begins, Ethereum (ETH) investors are looking to history for clues about the potential performance of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Ethereum's price history reveals a pattern of robust Q2 gains, with an average increase of 67.19%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto analyst Ali shared a screenshot of Ethereum's quarterly returns; ETH saw massive gains of 453% and 102.25% in Q2 of 2017 and 2019, respectively. Gains for the second quarter averaged 67.19%, with a median of 15.29%.\n\nQ2 has historically been very bullish for $ETH!\n\n\n\nHowever, we must consider the high probability that the @SECGov will delay the approval of a spot #Ethereum ETF, which may cause turbulence in the market. pic.twitter.com/TlZ3KZhr4e \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) April 1, 2024\n\nThis positive trend has been consistent enough to catch the eye of investors who see Q2 as a period of opportunity for Ethereum, with many anticipating another season of strong returns.\n\nHowever, the potential denial of a spot Ethereum ETF, which might cause significant price volatility, casts a shadow over this optimistic outlook.\n\nAn Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated investment platform for institutional and individual investors, thereby increasing demand and driving up ETH prices. Several issuers, including VanEck and Fidelity, have sought approval to launch them.\n\nHowever, approval for such an ETF is far from guaranteed. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts believe there is only a 25% likelihood of approval.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission previously postponed a decision on a spot exchange-traded fund, but it must make one by May 23, which is one of the applicants' final deadlines.\n\nOn May 23, the SEC will decide whether to approve or refuse VanEck's application. If they decline the request, issuers who still want to be approved will have to refile applications, or they can challenge the regulator's decision through litigation.\n\nSeven issuers are proposing to launch a spot Ethereum ETF fund: BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares with Ark and Hashdex.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 1.59% in the last 24 hours, at $3,558. Ethereum temporarily rose above $3,600 over the weekend after falling as much as 25% between March 11 and 19. According to Santiment, the number of ETH addresses holding coins has reached highs of 118,230, with midterm MVRV suggesting a mild bullish signal."

        "title": "Could This New Trillion-Dollar Market Opportunity Send Ethereum Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Keep an eye on Wall Street's new asset tokenization trend. If it takes off, it could unlock enormous value for Ethereum.\n\nBlackRock (BLK 0.02%), the company that led the push for the first spot ETF for Bitcoin, is back at it again, this time with an entirely new investment product for the Ethereum (ETH -2.20%) blockchain. If all goes according to plan, this new product could revolutionize the way Wall Street does business.\n\nThat's a lot to ask, of course, but I think Ethereum could be ready to take full advantage of this potential new trillion-dollar market opportunity. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at what this new product is, why it launched on Ethereum, and how it could transform the world of finance.\n\nWhat is a tokenized asset fund?\n\nThe new product, called the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is a tokenized asset fund, and it's part of a long-term trend on Wall Street called asset tokenization. While the term \"asset tokenization\" might sound a bit intimidating, it simply refers to the process of transforming a real-world financial asset into a blockchain-based digital asset.\n\nIn this case, BlackRock is \"tokenizing\" nearly $100 million worth of cash, T-bills, and repos. When institutional investors buy into the fund, they receive a crypto token on the Ethereum blockchain that has several unique properties. For example, it behaves much like a stablecoin, except that it also has the potential to pay out a daily yield. Stablecoins, which are usually pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, aren't supposed to be able to do that! The reason BlackRock's crypto token can do this is the result of the efficiencies made possible by blockchain technology.\n\nThat's why this product -- even though it might be a bit difficult to fully wrap one's head around it -- could be so revolutionary. In theory, blockchain-based digital assets should be superior to traditional, real-world assets. And thus, by extension, they should be more attractive to investors. According to BlackRock, the new tokenized asset fund boasts several key advantages for institutional investors when it comes to transparency, liquidity, and settlement time.\n\nLooking long term, a number of very smart people think asset tokenization could be a huge, multitrillion-dollar trend. Citigroup, for example, recently called asset tokenization a $4 trillion market opportunity. And the Boston Consulting Group has been even more bullish, calling it a potential $16 trillion dollar opportunity.\n\nWhy Ethereum?\n\nSo you can see where I'm going with this, right? Any blockchain that is leading this new multitrillion-dollar trend could see a huge spike in valuation, once investors realize what's happening and how significant it could be.\n\nThat's why it's so significant that BlackRock chose Ethereum for its first-ever tokenized asset fund. The Wall Street giant could have picked any other blockchain, but it picked Ethereum. And that's clearly due to the fact that Ethereum is the 800-pound gorilla of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. According to the total value locked metric (TVL), which measures how much DeFi activity is taking place on a particular blockchain, Ethereum currently accounts for a whopping 57% of all DeFi activity in the blockchain world.\n\nOf course, it's fair to push back and say: Hey, this is just one product. So what? Well, the bigger context is that BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with nearly $10 trillion in assets under management. Moreover, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is on record as saying that asset tokenization is an absolute megatrend for Wall Street. As soon as the new Bitcoin ETFs launched, he told CNBC that asset tokenization was coming next. So there's clearly more to come.\n\nPotential impact on valuation\n\nIf you agree that asset tokenization is the future of finance, and if you think that Ethereum will remain the DeFi leader, then it makes sense that Ethereum could soar in value as this trend gains legs. But by just how much?\n\nOne approach might be to track the TVL metric for Ethereum over time, to see if it is moving upward as expected. As more tokenized asset funds launch, and as Ethereum gets more and more involved with the asset tokenization trend, it should start showing up in the numbers. Currently, Ethereum has a TVL of $52 billion and a market cap of $425 billion. Roughly speaking, every $1 billion gain in TVL is worth an additional $8 billion in market cap.\n\nOf course, it's not a slam dunk that Ethereum will be able to get in front of this trend. After all, blockchains are by their very nature decentralized. There's no CEO at company headquarters running the numbers, demanding Ethereum leap headfirst into this market opportunity.\n\nInstead, it's much more the case of thousands of Ethereum developers around the world steadily making new improvements to the Ethereum blockchain, which in turn, make the blockchain more attractive to companies like BlackRock when they launch new products. So, while you should definitely keep your expectations for Ethereum in check, this could very much be a trend worth monitoring."

        "content": "Larry Fink believes in the potential of tokenized assets in institutional business. \u00abHis\u00bb company Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, has launched a new money market fund based on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAmong major asset managers, Blackrock is the one that is the most courageous in the crypto space. Last year, CEO Larry Fink said at a conference in New York that he believes \u00abthe tokenization of securities will define the next generation of markets\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThe distributed ledgers [on blockchain technology] will enable real-time settlement of transactions and change the entire ecosystem,\u00bb Fink added.\n\nBlackrock's Second Crypto Fund\n\nIn early January 2024, Blackrock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust, an investment fund for Bitcoin, and aimed at investors who do not want to or cannot buy the cryptocurrency directly themselves. The fund already has a net worth of $17.9 billion. With its second product, Blackrock diving much deeper into the mechanics of the crypto world.\n\nA week ago, the asset manager launched its Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund on the Ethereum blockchain under the name \u00abBuidl\u00bb. In the first few days, the inflows amounted to $240 million, according to the financial website \u00abBloomberg\u00bb (article subject to payment).\n\n1 Token = 1 Dollar\n\nThe product is a money market fund that works on a blockchain basis: shares are bought and sold via authorized wallets of Securitize Markets. Securitize Markets is a blockchain-based trading system that holds a broker-dealer license from the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra). \u00abBuidl\u00bb is aiming for a stable value of $1 per token. The dividends are distributed directly to the investors' wallets daily, as well as tokens.\n\nThe new product allows investors in the crypto space to invest in the money market. It bridges the growing ecosystem of crypto investors and the traditional money market.\n\nAround $360 million at Franklin Templeton\n\nA year ago, Franklin Templeton launched the Fonchain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), a crypto-based money market fund. So far, it has recorded deposits of around $360 million."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin's Net Worth: A Look Into His Crypto Holdings - Nansen",
        "content": "Vitalik is one of the most respected and influential people in crypto. As one of the cofounders of Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in the world today, many are curious about his net worth and how much Ethereum (ETH) he has. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into his crypto portfolio and holdings over time, and uncover an estimate of his net worth.\n\nWho is Vitalik Buterin?\n\nBorn in Russia in 1994 and later relocating to Canada, Vitalik Buterin emerged as a prodigy with a keen interest in computer science and mathematics. By 2014, he had co-founded Ethereum, introducing the groundbreaking concept of \"smart contracts\" through a decentralized protocol. His vision for Ethereum extended beyond merely creating a digital currency. He aimed to enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on a platform that is not only censorship-resistant but also secure, scalable, and sustainable. His goal was to democratize access to these services, fostering greater equality worldwide.\n\nVitalik Buterin's Net Worth\n\nAt the time of writing, Vitalik's net worth, primarily derived from his cryptocurrency holdings, exceeds $1.025 billion, with the bulk of his wealth, approximately $1 billion, attributed to his ETH holdings.\n\nDetermining his exact net worth is challenging, as his non-crypto assets (such as cash, real estate, and private equity investments) and any undisclosed crypto holdings are not publicly documented. However, it's reasonable to infer that a significant portion of his wealth is in cryptocurrencies.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Crypto Holdings\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the prominent co-founder of Ethereum has most of his crypto holdings in ETH and on the Ethereum network. $1.024B of his holdings across the blockchains that we have support for are on the Ethereum network.\n\nVitalik Buterin currently holds 278,524 ETH (~$1M) and 256 WETH ($919K), which makes him one of the largest holders of ETH. He currently holds 0.23% of all ETH in existence.\n\nBesides ETH, his two largest holdings are $21.7M in USDC and $782K in KNCL. KNCL is the legacy token of Kyber Network to which he is an advisor.\n\nVitalik\u2019s Crypto Activity\n\nHe is the largest donor to the CryptoRelief India Fund. The fund was set up during the peak of the Covid crisis to help provide healthcare and essentials to the country. Vitalik sent 50.69T SHIB ($931M), 600 ETH ($2.1M) and 100 MKR ($406K) to the fund.\n\nAnalyzing his portfolio over the past year, Vitalik had an initial position of 500 MKR tokens, worth $336K at that time, which he swapped to ETH and DAI when the position grew to over $570K in September 2023.\n\nOccasionally, Vitalik transfers a small portion of his funds over to exchanges such as Coinbase, along side further philanthropic activity.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith over $1B in onchain assets, Vitalik is among the largest whales in crypto and one of the top individual ETH holders. However, accumulating wealth isn't his primary goal; he is known for his generous contributions to philanthropic efforts. While a complete overview of all his assets is beyond our reach, we possess a deep understanding of his onchain activity."

        "title": "Debate on L3 networks' impact to Ethereum ensues after Polygon CEO comments - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Polygon CEO Marc Boiron thinks that L3s take away value from Ethereum.\n\nShare this article\n\nRecent comments made by Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron have ignited a debate on the necessity and potential consequences of Layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing that they may divert value and security away from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe growth of adoption and development for L3 networks like Orbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains, and Degen Chain, have attracted significant activity across a number platforms, prompting key figures in the crypto space such as Boiron to voice their opinion on the matter of Layer 3 networks.\n\n\u201cL3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,\u201d Boiron said.\n\nBoiron argues further argued that if all L3s settled to one L2, Ethereum would capture little value, putting its security at risk.\n\nThe L3 debate has been brewing for some time now. In 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin began the argument that the purpose of L3s were to provide a \u201ccustomizable functionality\u201d towards L2s, although not necessarily operating as extensible layers of the core functionality designed for L2s. To Buterin, a third layer on the blockchain ecosystem would only be practical if its function fundamentally differs to what L2s already serve.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Boiron\u2019s assessment. Some respondents argued that L2 value is inherently tied to Ethereum\u2019s value, while others pointed out the potential benefits of L3s, such as lower bridging costs and specialized functionality.\n\nPeter Haymond, senior partnership manager at Offchain Labs, countered Boiron\u2019s claims. According to Haymond, advantages such as low-cost native bridging from L2, custom gas tokens, and specialized state transition are functions that don\u2019t necessarily \u201ctake value\u201d away from Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum Foundation researcher Patrick McCorry expressed surprise at Boiron\u2019s take, suggesting that L3s could allow L2s to become settlement layers and ultimately rely on Ethereum as a \u201cglobal ordering service [and] final judge of settlement.\n\nDegen Chain, a recently launched L3 running on top of the Base L2 network, is one of the L3 networks that have gained a significant traction (and volume), with one anonymous trader reportedly making as much as a $2 million profit over a $7,000 investment.\n\nDegen Chain, notably, was built using Arbitrum Orbit, a new offering from the Arbitrum ecosystem that enables developers to create \u201cmodular\u201d or customizable Layer 2 and Layer 3 chains. In this context, Orbit chains operate by connecting to the core ecosystem of Arbitrum, with the ability to settle transactions over Ethereum L2 solutions."

With the Fed expected to begin cutting rates again at some point this year, the analyst suggests that a similar scenario could play out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how [Ethereum] plays out here, if it does just continue to mimic sort of a bigger version of [its pattern in 2019] or if it does something completely different\u2026\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t like the fact that I compare it to 2019 because it\u2019s gone up, because it\u2019s been taking a lot longer, but still, because ETH/BTC continues to drop, and because the Fed has not yet pivoted, why would we assume that it\u2019s not following the same thing?\n\nNothing has changed, right? It\u2019s still bleeding against Bitcoin, the Fed has not yet cut rates, and that was the turning point for it at the midcycle top last cycle.\u201d\n\nCowen says that if Ethereum repeats its 2019 correction, then a multi-month consolidation may be in store before the Fed begins a quantitative easing (QE) and crypto markets bounce again near the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cIf you have a hard time with that \u2013 sort of a six to nine-month lull in the market \u2013 what\u2019s fascinating is that if everything\u2019s been shifted by about three quarters, what if you shift this again?\n\nYou go three quarters out, you get to the end of the year and then QE (quantitative easing) returns and you get another bull market \u2013 I mean maybe, maybe that\u2019s how it plays out.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $3,530 at time of writing, a 2.28% decrease on the day.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas believes that \u201cEthereum (ETH) is not a security,\u201d and regulators are unlikely to label it as such.\n\nHaas shared her view on the matter during an interview with Fortune and pointed to the fact that both the SEC and the CFTC have said the same thing in the past.\n\nThe Coinbase CFO said that the classification issue stems from a lack of regulatory clarity around crypto in the US. She added:\n\n\u201cThe core problem here is that we still do not have comprehensive crypto regulation at the federal level in the US.\u201d\n\nShe urged for a \u201cclear, equitable, applied regulatory framework\u201d and said that regulatory clarity will better protect consumers and Coinbase. On the latter point, she noted clearer regulations would help Coinbase understand how to introduce compliant products in the US.\n\nSEC subpoenas\n\nFortune reported on March 20 that the SEC is attempting to define ETH as a security. Some companies in the US have reportedly received subpoenas in which the SEC identifies ETH as a security based on its shift to proof-of-stake, according to three anonymous sources.\n\nAccording to sources, the SEC is behind the recent inquiry launched into the Ethereum Foundation by an unknown state authority.\n\nThe companies and the regulator have not confirmed the subpoenas or probe.\n\nEthereum\u2019s status as a security \u2014 or commodity \u2014 is critical because it could affect which products are offered in the US.\n\nThe status of ETH is expected to impact whether spot Ethereum ETFs are treated similarly to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Additionally, US lawmakers have raised concerns about the ability of Special Purpose Broker-Dealers to work with ETH based on the case of Prometheum.\n\nCoinbase itself faces an ongoing SEC case against several of its products. Though the case refers to ETH in several areas, including concerning staking, it does not explicitly allege that ETH is a security.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Welcome to Future of Finance, where Fortune asks prominent people at major companies about their roles in this vast, ever-changing ecosystem\u2014and what it all means for how we use money.\n\nCoinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in the U.S., posting $273 million in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023, putting the firm\u2019s net profitability for all of 2023 at $95 million.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has always taken a long-term approach focusing on building in a compliant manner, even when it wasn\u2019t the popular choice,\u201d CEO Brian Armstrong said on a February earnings call. \u201cMany of our competitors cut corners and broke laws to get big fast, and we\u2019ve seen how that strategy played out.\u201d\n\nAlesia Haas joined the company in April 2018. She previously was CFO for Sculptor Capital Management (formerly Och-Ziff Capital Management Group), a global institutional alternative asset manager. She also served as CFO and head of strategy for OneWest Bank.\n\nIn a conversation with Fortune, Haas shared insights on Bitcoin\u2019s record high, the latest crypto bull market, the SEC\u2019s take on Ethereum, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s sentencing, and what drew her to the world of crypto from traditional finance.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\n\nEarlier this month, Bitcoin reached a record high above $72,000. Can you share some insight on what this means in a larger sense?\n\nI think it\u2019s important with crypto to zoom out and look at what has happened since the Bitcoin white paper and crypto first came on the scene. You\u2019ve seen four price cycles. What I love about looking at these price cycles is that every peak is higher than its last peak. And every trough is higher than the last trough.\n\nIf you look at this, you have a lot of volatility, but there is this steady up and into-the-right curve. When you look at the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year return of Bitcoin against every other asset, it has been one of the top performing assets over any other comparable.\n\nA lot of this was driven by the Bitcoin ETFs. What I think is important to note is that ETFs unlock new demand for this asset class. Previously, a lot of investment advisors couldn\u2019t access Bitcoin because of their investment mandates. Now they can buy Bitcoin in an ETF wrapper, and so it opens up new available capital.\n\nWhat does Bitcoin\u2019s rise mean for other cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum?\n\nI think that we\u2019re starting to see differentiation between different cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, where Bitcoin is a store-of-value asset, and people are putting it in their portfolio as an important store-of-value in wealth creation.\n\nEthereum has become the protocol that developers are increasingly choosing to build decentralized applications on top of. While Bitcoin is the largest asset, we generally see \u201ca rising tide lifts all ships\u201d effect where crypto then comes up. But you\u2019re starting to see differentiation because people are choosing Ethereum, and it is increasingly going to change depending on developer activity and user activity of that platform. Stablecoins and NFTs are built on Ethereum. There are just a lot of new use cases built on top of that protocol.\n\nSpeaking of Ethereum, what\u2019s the latest with this SEC now attempting to define it as a security?\n\nEthereum is not a security. Historically, the SEC has repeatedly said that Ether isn\u2019t a security. The CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] has said that Ether isn\u2019t a security. The core problem here is that we still do not have comprehensive crypto regulation at the federal level in the United States. And this is something that we feel passionately about. It\u2019s so critical to get regulatory clarity so we can have a clear, equitable, applied regulatory framework that will protect consumers and ensure responsible markets\u2014and also protect businesses like Coinbase, so we know how we can bring compliant products to the market and continue innovation here in America.\n\nWhat can we learn from the latest crypto bull market?\n\nIn general, what we\u2019re seeing is similar to past bull markets, whereas crypto prices rise, you see an increase in volatility, then you see an increase in engagement. As we shared on our Q4 earnings call in February, we saw elevated engagement, net inflows across the board in retail institutional, and we saw higher trading volumes.\n\nWith almost $12 billion of net inflows into ETFs, we\u2019ve seen a market cap of over $2.5 trillion. What this does is it puts crypto back in the headlines. It has become a topic of conversation in households. And we\u2019re seeing really great engagement from customers who sort of went dormant a little bit in 2021, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cOh, this asset class is back.\u201d\n\nThe crypto sector nosedived after FTX imploded and cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested. He was just sentenced to 25 years in prison. Has the industry finally turned a page?\n\nWell, fraud is fraud. And I\u2019m pleased to see the process being followed when you have fraud in the markets. It\u2019s a travesty that occurred. But I think we\u2019ve moved on, and I think the market has largely moved on. Coinbase was always focused on compliance. We are excited to build and regain the trust of our customers. But there has been a flight to quality. We\u2019ve seen that flight to quality now over the past year. And we\u2019re pleased to continue to see people\u2019s focus and growth on good companies here.\n\nBefore joining Coinbase, you worked in asset management, as a CFO, and held senior roles at Merrill Lynch and General Electric. What most attracted you to your current company?\n\nI\u2019m old enough that I grew up in the early internet era and have just watched the transformation of how technology creates new use cases. When I learned about blockchain, I could see that if you tokenize real-world assets\u2014and send value peer to peer\u2014that was going to create a more inclusive, faster, and cheaper financial system. And that was such an exciting thing to be a part of.\n\nI have worked for banks and asset managers, and I saw how many people touch the transaction just to move money from me to you, and how many different steps and different market participants it takes. I saw the cost. I saw the friction. And I said, \u201cIf technology solves this, it will be adopted. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if.\u201d I wanted to be part of that excitement in the journey to build trusted products in this ecosystem.\n\nComing from traditional finance, I knew that if you\u2019re holding customers\u2019 assets, their wealth, their investments, you need to become a trusted brand. I thought I could really contribute value to Coinbase.\n\nHow would you describe the role of digital assets in the future of finance?\n\nWell, first of all, it\u2019s already here: 52 million Americans own crypto. We now have ETFs for anybody with a retirement account to own crypto. You can now send a U.S. dollar in the form of a stablecoin to anyone in the world, anywhere, anytime, cheaply and instantly. It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re already here.\n\nI think what we\u2019ll see is an increasing number of transactions happening on the blockchain. We\u2019ll tokenize more real-world assets. Just last week, BlackRock announced they\u2019re tokenizing a money-market fund. Now we have money-market funds where you can earn high yields but in tokenized form.\n\nThese are new ways that we can bring the global world together in a peer-to-peer way\u2014fewer intermediaries, lower costs\u2014and tokenize real-world assets, which makes those assets more available to more people in more markets. I think that\u2019s really exciting."

        "content": "Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan, has indicated that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may push back the approval of eagerly awaited Ethereum (ETH-USD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to December.\n\nAfter its spot Bitcoin ETF debut, which rapidly amassed over $2 billion and ranked fifth in what\u2019s been dubbed by the cryptocurrency community the \u201cCointucky Derby,\u201d Bitwise now faces another showdown with the SEC. Despite the expected delay, Hougan remains optimistic, proposing that a more gradual introduction to Ethereum ETFs could allow traditional finance more time to acclimate to the crypto ecosystem, potentially setting the stage for a stronger market entry.\n\nSimultaneously, Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, has actively lobbied for the SEC\u2019s approval of spot market Ethereum ETFs, citing Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus as a superior security measure compared to Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work system. Consensys championed Ethereum\u2019s robust security framework in a persuasive letter to the SEC, arguing for the unfounded nature of the SEC\u2019s fraud and manipulation concerns.\n\nEthereum Technical Analysis\n\nEthereum\u2019s price action over Easter Weekend ended on a positive note. ETH ended lower on Saturday, but only slightly (-0.10%). Its performance on Sunday, however, was a very different story, as Etheruem closed higher by nearly +4% in the $3,650 value area. Sunday\u2019s close resulted in the highest daily close since March 15.\n\nOn a weekly timeframe, the TipRanks summary of indicators shows Ethereum\u2019s current MACD indicator at 393.07, typically signaling a Sell due to the potential downward momentum. However, the broader context of Ethereum\u2019s market performance, particularly its exponential moving averages, tells a more bullish story.\n\nThe 20-period EMA of Ethereum at $3,014.89 is significantly below its current price of $3,610.09. Similarly, the 50-period EMA is $2,502.46, also well below the current price. These indicators typically suggest a bullish trend, as the current price exceeds short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating strong buying pressure and potential for continued upward movement.\n\nOn a monthly time frame, Ethereum ended March higher with a gain of +9.09%, but off of its monthly highs near $4,100.\n\nDon\u2019t let crypto give you a run for your money.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bonk Plunged Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Speculative assets are dropping to start the week.\n\nVolatility continues to be the name of the game in cryptocurrencies and today is no different. But unlike most of 2024, the market is working against investors today.\n\nAs of 1:45 p.m. ET, the value of Bitcoin (BTC -2.06%) has dropped 2.8%, Ethereum (ETH -2.20%) is down 5.2%, and Bonk (BONK -4.52%) has fallen 9.4%. The move was impacted by a long holiday weekend in parts of the world, but 24/7 trading in crypto kept market speculation moving.\n\nInflation strikes again\n\nThe biggest data point impacting the market today is the ISM factory index, which improved by 2.5% in March to 50.3%. A reading over 50% indicates that manufacturing managers think the manufacturing market is expanding. This followed 16 straight months of expected declines.\n\nInvestors take this reading as a sign the economy is doing fine, despite higher interest rates over the past few years. If inflation is under control and the Federal Reserve doesn't need to cut rates to help the economy, it may not cut rates at all.\n\nBond traders are now pricing odds at a rate cut in June 2024 at less than 50%, which would have been a shock coming into the year. Investors were expecting as much as six rate cuts and they may get through two quarters with none.\n\nCrypto's decline today\n\nThere's a correlation between technology and high-growth stocks and cryptocurrencies and part of the move higher over the past six months has been an anticipation of lower interest rates. As that thesis falls apart it's not unusual to see cryptocurrencies drop.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were another catalyst and that brought billions of dollars into the industry. But last week they started to see outflows, although those turned into inflows again late in the week.\n\nEthereum has also gotten a boost from speculation that it will get ETFs approved over the next few months. But that's not certain in the current regulatory environment.\n\nIf ETFs aren't a catalyst because more aren't approved, crypto values may slide.\n\nBonk's move is just a mirror of the others with some extra volatility added in. This is a meme coin that's become a popular alternative to Dogecoin, but its main value is speculation rather than being a blockchain currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nWhere does crypto go from here?\n\nI think the major catalysts of 2024 are already behind us. Bitcoin's ETFs have helped increase awareness and investment in crypto and that pulled the entire industry higher. And speculation based on the economic environment and a potential cut in rates seems to have been overdone.\n\nThat leaves fundamentals driving the crypto market and that's not a great place to be. Bitcoin may have value as a \"digital gold,\" but I think it's more of a speculative asset than anything. Ethereum's promise was always that it would provide real-world use cases in finance and digital assets, but it's so slow and so much more expensive that other blockchains are gaining popularity.\n\nBonk's meme pop has been nice, but the meme coins never seem to last. And without a catalyst, I could see all three cryptos falling over the next few months as investors look for more fundamental value on the market."

This enhancement aims to streamline the protocol by reducing the functionality of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, thereby enhancing implementation efficiency and bolstering security measures.\n\nThis move, as elucidated by Buterin, is part of a broader mission to declutter Ethereum's infrastructure and alleviate technical burdens. The Purge initiative entails eliminating redundancies, reducing resource loads and fortifying security protocols to bolster Ethereum's efficiency and resilience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA quick note on next steps in Ethereum protocol simplification and node resource load decreases (aka \"the Purge\"):https://t.co/BAebCGrisB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 1, 2024\n\nAmong the key transformations initiated under The Purge, Ethereum clients have witnessed a substantial reduction in code lines, with the elimination of support for pre-merge (PoW) networks. Additionally, Ethereum's storage mechanism has undergone optimization, significantly reducing storage requirements for node operators.\n\nThe Purge by Vitalik Buterin\n\nHowever, Buterin does not stop there. He outlines potential areas for further refinement, including the revaluation of precompiles and the optimization of historical data storage. These steps are aimed at enhancing the functionality of ETH while simultaneously reducing barriers to entry for node operators and developers.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin hints at the transition to SimpleSerialize (SSZ), a more efficient block structure, heralding a simpler and cleaner future for Ethereum's data management.\n\nThe overarching goal of \"The Purge\" is to streamline Ethereum's architecture, reduce technical complexities, and enhance its scalability and decentralization. By prioritizing protocol simplification and security enhancements, Ethereum aims to solidify its position as a leading blockchain platform capable of supporting diverse decentralized applications and use cases."

        "content": "Ethereum price trades inside the $3,054 to $4,095 range on the four-hour chart.\n\nA sweep of the sell-side liquidity seems likely before ETH attempts to move $4,000.\n\nIn some cases, ETH could sweep the rang high at $4,095.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks ready for an ascent, at least from a breakout traders\u2019 perspective. But this isn\u2019t always the case as market makers or smart money tends to collect liquidity in the opposite direction first. So, eager ETH bulls need to exercise patience.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Retail watches from the sidelines with a bias for shorts\n\nEthereum price likely to trap impatient traders\n\nEthereum price set up a range, extending from $3,054 to $4,095 during its 25% descent between March 11 and 20. Currently ETH is has triggered a quick ascent above the aforementioned range\u2019s midpoint at $3,574.\n\nWhile this volatile move might be alluring to trade, investors need to exercise caution. In crypto, the initial breakout is often undone by quick corrections. The aim of such a move is to collect the liquidity below key levels. In this case, ETH has produced higher highs since forming the range low on March 20.\n\nHence, a breakout above $3,574 and $3,658 is likely to be short-lived, i.e., a correction might ensue soon. A sweep of $3,461 could be a good place to enter longs, provided Bitcoin (BTC) is also done with its short-term liquidity collection. In such a case, ETH is most likely to rally higher, overcome the $3,658 hurdle and eye a retest of the $4,000 psychological level. Resting, $95 above this level is the range high at $4,095, which could also be tagged if the buying pressure is high.\n\nAlso read: Crypto traders bet $2.4M on spot Ether ETF approval results\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the contrary, if Bitcoin price fails to recover after short-term liquidity run, it will most likely take altcoins down with it. In such a case, Ethereum price could sweep the range low at $3,054. A flip of the said level into a resistance level would invalidate the bullish thesis for ETH and confirm the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThis development could lead to Ethereum price crashing nearly 2% and tagging the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin wants rollups to hit stage one decentralization by year-end\n\n(This story was corrected on April 1 at 06:10 GMT to say that the $4,095 level could be revisited if there is high buying pressure, not selling pressure.)"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst is detailing when he believes Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins could outpace Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 321,000 YouTube subscribers that the altcoin market is setting up for a massive rally \u2013 with the ETH/BTC pair as its proxy.\n\n\u201cStill seems like the market is building for those mega 37x potential returns for altcoins. [ETH/BTC] is a bit of a proxy for the altcoin pump.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pizzino, if history repeats itself and ETH/BTC behaves the same way it did the last time Bitcoin hit its 2021 cycle peak, traders can expect a breakout of the pair sometime in the coming months. Pizzino\u2019s chart indicates that it could be in May or June.\n\n\u201cThe point here is: [we had a] new Bitcoin all-time high month, the following month was down and then ETH went on a pretty significant run from there.\n\nSo if things are similar to last time, maybe this is the move down because Bitcoin is pushing to new all-time highs, it\u2019s taking the show, then you see another red month here as Bitcoin continues on, and then a reversal here for ETH.\u201d\n\nETH/BTC is trading for 0.05145 BTC ($3,616) at time of writing.\n\nPizzino goes on to say that the smart contract platform Solana (SOL) will likely go through a similar process.\n\n\u201cSame sort of thing for Solana\u2026\n\nJust looking back at the previous cycle, [Solana was a much] weaker crypto at the time, [it is] now a lot stronger than what it was back then, but you can see also with the Bitcoin new all-time high price around November (2021), it still went lower even against [the] USD at that time, but then that was the time to skyrocket, so we\u2019re in a similar sort of period now where Bitcoin\u2019s gotten into its new all-time high.\u201d\n\nSolana is trading for $196 at time of writing, a 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs may overwhelm Ethereum ETFs if they are approved in May, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says.\n\nEthereum ETF delay may not imply rejection from the SEC.\n\nEthereum may see a decline if Bitcoin fails to recover\n\nEthereum\u2019s (ETH) prices loses some ground on Monday, paring back some of the gains seen during the weekend, as traders continue to speculate over the possibility of an approval of the spot Ether ETF in May.\n\nBitwise Asset Management\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said in a Forbes interview published on Sunday that a delay to December would make the launch more successful. This comes at a time when other key market players have provided different views that lean towards the idea that the SEC will likely delay the approval of the seven spot Ethereum ETF filings.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Latest Ethereum ETF applicant wants 12-month delay\n\nMatt Hougan disclosed to Forbes that the recent demand for Ethereum ETFs is a \"natural pathway that crypto investors have followed for 15 years.\" He mentioned how investors usually follow a pattern of wanting exposure to Bitcoin and, eventually, other crypto assets. This follows the significant growth of Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11, as they have attracted more than $10 billion in less than three months, making them the fastest-growing ETFs in history.\n\nWhile Hougan believes an Ethereum ETF will also attract investors, he suggested a 12-month delay will make it more successful. \"I think the Ethereum ETFs will be more successful if they launch in 12 months than (...) in May,\" said Hougan.\n\nHe further stated that traditional finance investors are still trying to master Bitcoin and the crypto market. \"I know that sounds goofy, but I think TradFi is still digesting Bitcoin and if you give TradFi time to get comfortable with Bitcoin and crypto, they will be ready for the next thing,\" Hougan emphasized.\n\nBitwise filed for a spot in Ethereum ETF on March 28, joining other giant institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC has refused to engage with these applicants and delayed any spot Ethereum filings. VanEck's filing is due for a decision on May 23 as a final deadline.\n\nAs a result, many analysts, including Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, have lowered their odds of spot ETH approval. Still, the chief legal officers of Coinbase and Grayscale are optimistic of a May approval, citing Ethereum's commodity status.\n\nAmid the delay, the SEC has also issued subpoenas to three firms that transacted with the Ethereum Foundation, according to a Fortune report, in a bid to classify Ethereum as a security. While many have expressed concerns that such classification would hurt the chances of an Ethereum ETF, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in an interview with Fox Business that a spot ETH ETF can still be possible even if the underlying asset is designated a security.\n\nTechnical Analysis: ETH may crash if Bitcoin fails to recover\n\nETH\u2019s price recently tagged the $3,574 mid-point of the $3,054 to $4,095 range it set up during its 25% descent between March 11 and 20. While the move may be attractive to trade, \u201ca breakout above $3,574 and $3,658 is likely to be short-lived,\u201d said FXStreet Analyst Akash Girimath.\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s short-term range forecasts $4,000 but with a warning for eager ETH bulls\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAkash further emphasized that if Bitcoin fails to recover after its short-term liquidity collection, ETH may crash to the $3,000 psychological level."

Discover SCENE\n\nBase, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, hit a daily record of $1.22 billion worth of trading volume at decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Saturday. The frenzied surge in trading is due to a gold rush for meme coins that has Base-native coins like DEGEN and BRETT hitting over half a billion dollars each in market cap.\n\nThe network set a record for unique daily wallets interacting with a DEX on Saturday with 172,000, according to public blockchain data curated by Dune, and nearly matched that total again on Sunday.\n\nDecentralized exchange (DEX) volume on Base has dropped into the new week\u2014but is still holding significantly higher than previous months, with about $965 million in volume on Sunday, and already $847 million worth so far on Monday as of this writing. As of this writing, Saturday's record is the only day that Base DEX volume has topped the billion-dollar mark.\n\nThe vast majority of that volume is coming from Uniswap, the cross-chain decentralized exchange, which sucked up $1.14 billion worth of the Saturday total. Uniswap has held a roughly 90% daily share of Base DEX volume over the past several days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBroadly, the Base network has seen a \"parabolic\" surge in overall transactions, tweeted Alex Svanevik, founder and CEO of crypto analytics platform Nansen. The platform's data points to an all-time daily peak of nearly 2.39 million transactions on Friday, the most recent day shown on its Base dashboard.\n\nWith the increase in volume and a significant surge in daily active users, Base might end up being the go-to destination for meme coins for this cycle\u2014at least in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nOther meme coins have even started migrating to Base, with HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu launching a Base version of their token last week. The price briefly spiked to over $10 before coming back down to parity with its Ethereum mainnet counterpart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nme 3 days ago - base season? can you guys just shut up, you just missed sol me today - were buying memecoins on a base L3 memechain strap in boys \u2014 moon (@MoonOverlord) March 31, 2024\n\nMany traders are calling for \u201cBase season\u201d in an effort to match the momentum of layer-1 network Solana. For the past few months, Solana has been the go-to destination for meme coins, with tokens like Dogwifhat (WIF) hitting over a billion dollars in market cap, and many others with hundreds of millions in market cap as well.\n\nWill the crypto gods give degens a chance to run it all back on Base?

The list of angel investors includes Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, co-founders of Solana, Luca Netz, owner and CEO of Pudgy Penguins, and Gabby Dizon, co-founder of Yield Guild Games.\n\nThis latest round of funding follows Parallel's previous raise of $50 million from Paradigm in 2021, which valued the studio at $500 million. While the updated valuation and the format of the recent funding round were not disclosed, Parallel Studios did share some insights into how they plan to utilize the $35 million infusion.\n\nThe studio intends to expand its user base by onboarding more players through the Parallel Ambassadors program and engaging influencers. Additionally, Parallel Studios has exciting plans for the future. They aim to launch Parallel on the Epic Games Store and Steam, as well as introduce the Planetfall expansion within the game. Mobile versions of Parallel are also in consideration, although specific timelines have yet to be determined.\n\nIn addition to Parallel, the studio has been actively developing Colony, an AI-powered \"survival simulation\" game built on the Solana blockchain. Colony differentiates itself from Parallel by utilizing generative AI technology. Funding from this round will contribute to the development of Wayfinder, an on-chain AI protocol that powers Colony and potentially other applications and games."

These tokens offer the allure of quick returns due to their viral potential and active communities. Moreover, being built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, they benefit from its robust security and smart contract capabilities, making these investments inherently linked to the broader success of Ethereum (ETH). The innovative use cases, such as DeFi applications and NFTs that many of these memecoins are exploring, also add a layer of utility and long-term value proposition that appeals to large-scale investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: A Calculated Bet on Ethereum's (ETH) Future\n\nAs Ethereum whales join the ranks of investors in ETH-based memecoins like Shiba Budz (BUDZ), their actions speak volumes about the evolving strategies in cryptocurrency investment. These moves are not merely speculative bets but rather calculated decisions to maximize returns in anticipation of significant milestones like the Ethereum (ETH) ETF approval.

        "content": "James Seyffart, a prominent Bloomberg analyst covering ETFs and the broader fund industry, has clarified that the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved in the US are still low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore that, he injected some excitement into the crypto community by making an April Fools' Day joke about Ethereum ETF approval odds skyrocketing to 99%.\n\n\"Sorry guys, had to join the fun,\" the analyst quipped on the X social media network.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise recently submitted a new Ethereum ETF application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, was quick to pour some cold water on Bitwise's effort, stating that the odds for Ethereum ETF approval remain at a \"pessimistic\" 25%. Moreover, Balchunas has stated that he could go \"even lower\" than that if he could. \"Again, personally I want them to approve but I also want to get the call right so we will be a perfect 4 for 4 in crypto ETF predictions,\" he added.\n\nLast month, Ethereum ETF approval odds plummeted after the SEC delayed its decision on a slew of existing proposals. Legal analyst Jake Chervinsky speculated that political pressure could be one of the key reasons behind the SEC's hesitancy.\n\nMoreover, according to various reports, the SEC intends to classify the second-largest cryptocurrency as a security, which could further complicate the approval process.\n\nThat said, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently clarified that a spot Ethereum ETF could be approved even if the top altcoin ends up being a security. The financial behemoth filed for a spot-based Ethereum ETF last November.\n\nIn January, the SEC greenlit various spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other prominent names."

        "content": "Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.\n\nMilei Moneda (MEDA) targets Uniswap launch, with investors excited about the 100% price surge from $0.010 to $0.020 in its ongoing presale.\n\nSolana integrates CCTP for blockchain interoperability; the price dips from $200 to $180, with the April 2024 outlook at $260.Ethereum addresses validator concerns, but Buterin proposes failure rate penalties.\n\nThe price rises to $3,000 and may reach $5,000 by May. In the world of cryptocurrency, Solana, Ethereum, and Milei Moneda are making waves with their recent developments. From integrations to proposals and upcoming launches, each holds the promise of shaping the future of the market in unique ways.\n\nYou might also like: Developer activity rises on Cardano; Milei Moneda eyes growth\n\nSolana integrates circle\u2019s CCTP, sees decline\n\nIn a move set to enhance interoperability across blockchain ecosystems, Solana has integrated Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP).\n\nThis partnership enables developers on the Solana ecosystem to seamlessly exchange USDC tokens with Ethereum and other leading blockchains directly. The integration underscores Solana\u2019s commitment to fostering a more interconnected DeFi landscape as one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite this positive development, SOL experienced a decline from the $200 region to the $180 region in March 2024. This dip reflects broader market volatility, with several other cryptocurrencies also witnessing declines. Experts still set an optimistic eye on the $260 mark by April 2024.\n\nNotably, Solana\u2019s recent integration with CCTP positions it as a top ten cryptocurrency in the ongoing efforts to improve cross-chain interoperability and expand the utility of digital assets.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, partnerships like this one by Solana highlight the importance of collaboration in driving innovation and adoption within the industry.\n\nEthereum validators face decentralization challenges\n\nRecent discussions among Ethereum stakeholders have highlighted concerns regarding the increasing number of validators on the network. Venture investor Evan Van Ness and staking pool operator Gabriel Weide caution that an overabundance of validators could lead to failed transactions, potentially undermining the Ethereum network\u2019s reliability.\n\nPeter Kim, head of engineering at Coinbase Wallet, acknowledges the impressive growth in the number of validators but notes that the current limit of 32 ETH per validator may be artificially inflating this figure. However, he suggests that changes to this limit on the Ethereum network may be imminent.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a solution to enhance network decentralization. Buterin\u2019s proposal involves penalizing validators in proportion to their average failure rate, aiming to level the playing field between large and small Ethereum stakers.\n\nYou might also like: Milei Moneda sees investor interest as Solana, Toncoin, surge\n\nDespite these controversies, Ethereum moved from the $2,000 region to the $3,000 region between February and March 2024. Experts are optimistic that the project will continue soaring to even the $5,000 region again by May 2024, hence creating a new ATH.\n\nAs Ethereum (ETH) continues to navigate issues of scalability and decentralization, Buterin\u2019s proposal offers a potential path forward to address these concerns and ensure the network\u2019s long-term viability, proving to be the best crypto to buy.\n\nMilei Moneda (MEDA): A rising project with innovation\n\nMilei Moneda, one of the top DeFi projects of 2024, is poised for a significant milestone as it prepares to debut on Uniswap in May 2024.\n\nWith a focus on economic freedom and peer-to-peer markets, Milei Moneda stands out as one of the top crypto coins for its deflationary token model and integration of popular NFTs, making it the best crypto investment.\n\nAnticipation is high among investors, who expect a 100% surge in price from $0.010 to $0.020 once it launches. By boasting a total token supply of 500,000,000, the project prioritizes accessibility, liquidity, and rewards, aiming to carve out a top spot among the top altcoins.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, Milei Moneda emerges as a compelling option, offering both profit potential and alignment with current market trends in DeFi.\n\nWith Solana eyeing $260, Ethereum addressing decentralization, and Milei Moneda promising an economic revolution, the crypto frenzy continues.\n\nWhether it\u2019s exploring established giants or betting on rising stars, the journey through the crypto space promises both challenges and rewards for those willing to embrace its dynamic nature.\n\nTo learn more about this project, visit the Milei Moneda presale or join the community"

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The cryptocurrency market witnessed high volatility this week, evidenced by the narrow consolidation in leading digital assets Bitcoin and Ethereum. The neutral candle confirmation formation with long wicks reflects no dominance from buyers or sellers toward these assets. However, a look at 4 hours shows that the ETH price shows a short sideways trend in developing a bullish reversal pattern called an inverted head and shoulder pattern.\n\nAlso Read: Surging Ethereum Whale Transactions Hint At Upcoming ETH Price Rally\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhale Activity Signals Confidence as Ethereum Tests $3700 Resistance\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap rebounded from its last correction in March\u2019s fourth week as price downfall halted at $3060. This horizontal level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level indicating a healthy retracement phase for Ether to recuperate its bullish momentum.\n\nFurthermore, a positive turnaround uplifted the coin\u2019s market value by 20% to challenge resistance at $3700. Amid the current market uncertainty, the ETH price is wavering below this overhead resistance to currently trade at $3530.\n\nHowever, this consolidation in the 4-hour chart revealed the formation of a bullish reversal pattern called inverted head and shoulder. This chart setup commonly spotted at market bottoms indicates a renewed buying interest among traders.\n\nMoreover, In a recent observation by crypto trader Alicharts, there\u2019s a notable rise in Ethereum whale transactions, suggesting bullish sentiment among key investors despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent price dips.\n\nThis uptick in activity from large stakeholders typically indicates a positive outlook on Ethereum\u2019s value, hinting at a possible price recovery ahead.\n\nDespite the #Ethereum price correction seen over the past few weeks, $ETH whale transactions are on the rise \u2014 a bullish indicator for future #ETH price movements! pic.twitter.com/urMBA8ofAS \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) March 29, 2024\n\nEthereum Bulls Watch for $3700 Signal to Extend Rally\n\nThe Ethereum price must breach the $3700 resistance with a 4-hour candle closing for the head and shoulder pattern to hold true. Doing so will provide buyers with suitable support to prolong its recovery trend to $4300.\n\nOn a contrary note, a breakdown below the support at $3460 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nTechnical Indicator\n\nExponential Moving Average: The ETH price above the key EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the near-term trend as bullish.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The daily RSI slope wavering around 50% indicates an uncertain market sentiment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

They have a bullish bias on the higher timeframe price charts, and whales were accumulating both assets at a rapid pace.\n\nA recent AMBCrypto report highlighted that this accumulation could continue for some more time. Bitcoin has high amounts of liquidity close by, which could hinder attempts to break out in either direction.\n\nBitcoin saw stalled momentum and buying pressure\n\nThe Fibonacci retracement levels plotted for the rally from $50.5k to $73.7k showed that the 50% retracement level was tested as support in mid-March.\n\nIt saw a decent reaction and Bitcoin was trading at $50k at press time.\n\nYet, the RSI on the 12-hour chart was only at 57, which signaled bullish momentum but not notable strength.\n\nThe Chaikin Money Flow was at +0.01 and would need to climb above +0.05 to show significant capital inflow.\n\nThe market structure on the 12-hour chart was bullish. A BTC that falls below $60.7 would flip the market structure bearishly.\n\nThe liquidation levels heatmap showed a significant concentration in the $74k-$74.8k zone. To the south, the $60k-$60.7k also has an intense number of liquidation levels.\n\nCloser to current prices, the band of liquidity at $68.2k was also expected to play a role.\n\nA move above $72k is a cause for celebration for Bitcoin bulls, but expect multiple tries before prices break past the $75k region.\n\nEthereum climbs to the LTF resistance \u2014 will it break out soon?\n\nEthereum also saw its momentum stall out over the past two weeks. Its 12-hour RSI showed a reading of 54, which signaled bullishness.\n\nIts market structure was also bullish, and the 78.6% retracement level saw a good reaction from the buyers.\n\nHowever, despite the buying volume in the past ten days, the OBV could not embark on an uptrend. It has sunk almost as low as the January highs, even though the price of ETH is close to 40% higher.\n\nThis lack of demand meant Ethereum bulls could take time to catch their breath before attempting the next rally. At press time, it faced some short-term resistance at $3680.\n\nCoinalyze metrics noted the steep selling pressure in the spot markets in March. The spot CVD trended downward this month and only recently flattened out from the southward spiral.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

The proposal aims to introduce a new asset class to Aave and enhance the diversity of the lending and staking category.\n\nLiquid Restaking tokens (LRTs) have gained significant popularity recently due to their productivity as staking assets. These tokens are highly correlated with Ethereum and are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH for yield leveraged staking strategies, particularly with the introduction of eMode.\n\nThe integration of ezETH into Aave is expected to increase demand for ezETH, resulting in boosted revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol. Moreover, it\u2019s anticipated to enhance liquidity and peg stability for ezETH. The proposal highlights relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) for Renzo Protocol, including Total Value Locked ($1.9 billion), Total supply (526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH), and 24-hour trading volume ($80.2 million).\n\nIf consensus is reached during this temporary check, the proposal will escalate to subsequent stages, including Snapshot and ARFC, before final confirmation through an AIP vote.

        "content": "Whale transactions worth over $100,000 rose significantly in March.\n\nThe optimism could be flowing from CFTC labelling ETH as a commodity.\n\nDespite critical events like the Dencun Upgrade, Ethereum [ETH] underperformed in March, with just a marginal increase of 0.79% over the 30-day period. The second-largest cryptocurrency faced strong resistance at the $4,000 mark, dropping to $3.500 as of this writing.\n\nBut the slump didn\u2019t deter large investors of the coin, who continued to add Ethereum exposure to their portfolios.\n\nWhales trust ETH to go big\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, whale transactions worth over $100,000 rose significantly throughout the month. These transactions resulted in a sharp increase in small whale wallets which typically hold between 1,000 \u2013 10,000 coins.\n\nThis nature of accumulation is known as \u201cbuy the dip.\u201d The strategy involves buying assets during temporary price drops to benefit from potential future price increases.\n\nDriven by research and business acumen, this plan is usually adopted for fundamentally-strong assets with long-term growth potential.\n\nThe level of bullishness was also reflected in the increasing long exposure in the derivatives markets. As per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital\u2019s data, about 72% of total whale positions on crypto exchange Binance were betting on ETH to rise.\n\nWhales\u2019 bullish strategy seemed to have been picked up by the broader market. The general mood was one of \u201cGreed\u201d as per the Fear and Greed Index. Typically, such sentiments lead to FOMO, drawing in more investors and adding to the buying pressure.\n\nBut what was motivating whales to be bullish on ETH?\n\nChances of spot ETF approval improving?\n\nIn recent weeks, a lot of pessimism had set in surrounding the approval of Ether spot ETFs. The odds were getting lowered due to increasing possibility of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deeming Ether as a security.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, U.S. derivatives market regulator, Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) referred ETH as a commodity in the recent KuCoin lawsuit.\n\nThis could have rekindled investors\u2019 hopes that an Ether spot ETF would eventually see the light of day. If approved, spot ETFs have the potential to do for ETH what Bitcoin has been witnessing since mid-January."

        "content": "eth-usd\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is buzzing with anticipation as April begins. While analysts predict a price surge, navigating the market requires understanding the underlying currents. Here\u2019s a breakdown of key factors to consider before trading ETH:\n\nInstitutional Interest in Ethereum on the Rise\n\nBitwise, a leading crypto asset manager, is eyeing an exchange-traded product (ETP) encompassing Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 networks and applications. This signifies growing institutional interest in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s potential.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Approval: A May or December Dilemma?\n\nHopes for a spot Ethereum ETF launch in May are tempered by concerns about market readiness. Bitwise\u2019s CIO believes a December rollout might be more suitable to allow traditional finance (TradFi) to absorb the recent Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nEthereum Network Fundamentals Remain Strong\n\nThe number of Ethereum addresses holding coins has hit a new all-time high, showcasing expanding investor participation. Whale transactions are on the rise, indicating potential bullish price action ahead. A significant portion of the Ethereum supply has moved off exchanges, suggesting increasing scarcity.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Patience is Key\n\nWhile many anticipate a price increase, analysts warn against being overly bullish. Market makers might employ deceptive tactics to collect liquidity before a surge.\n\nThe recent rapid rise above the $3,054-$4,095 range midpoint needs confirmation for long-term sustainability.\n\nBeware of False Breakouts\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is notorious for initial surges followed by corrections. This tactic allows for liquidity collection and can trap impatient investors. A short-term rise above $3,574 and $3,658 might be followed by a correction.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Influence: A Domino Effect\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price direction significantly impacts altcoins like Ethereum. If Bitcoin experiences a sustained recovery, Ethereum could breach the $4,000 resistance level.\n\nConversely, a Bitcoin price slump could drag Ethereum down, potentially leading to a continuation of the downtrend.\n\nETH/USD Technical Analysis: Bulls Gather Momentum\n\nEthereum is currently trading above $3,500, facing immediate resistance at $3,630. Overcoming this hurdle opens the path to a more substantial barrier at $3,650. A sustained break above $3,680 could propel ETH towards $3,800 and potentially even $4,000."

        "title": "Polygon CEO stirs controversy claiming L3s drain Ethereum value - CryptoTvplus",
        "content": "Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon, stirred controversy in the crypto community this weekend by asserting that layer-3 networks are not only unnecessary for scaling Ethereum but also divert value away from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nOn April 1, Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, made a bold statement: Polygon Labs did not work on layer 3s because layer 3s were not needed to scale existing networks like Ethereum.\n\n\u201cL3s exist only to take value away from Ethereum and onto the L2s on which the L3s are built,\u201d he said.\n\nBoiron\u2019s views, while provocative, sparked a lively discussion among his followers. One respondent disagreed with Boiron, stating that layer-2s on Ethereum \u201cwere value on Ethereum.\u201d Boiron acknowledged the validity of this point but also emphasized a distinction.\n\n\u201cI disagree that L2 value is Ethereum value. Just take this to the extreme. If all L3s settled to one L2, then Ethereum would capture no value, and, thus, Ethereum security would be at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, we don\u2019t care what people do. They can build L3s on anything, including Polygon networks,\u201d he continued before adding. \u201cWe just aren\u2019t trying to suck all value onto Polygon networks instead of sharing with Ethereum its fair share.\u201d\n\nBoiron emphasized that Polygon\u2019s primary goal had been to enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability at a time when no other entity had been pursuing it. He highlighted their strategy of leveraging the parallelization of the EVM and incorporating privacy measures. Boiron contended that \u201cL3s were not aligned with that objective.\u201d\n\nLayer-3 protocols occupy a niche space in the blockchain ecosystem. They had been designed to be built on top of existing layer-2 solutions to address specific needs such as scaling, performance optimization, interoperability, customization, and cost reduction for various decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nIn case you missed it: Polygon wants to unify multiple blockhains in a single network using the AggLayer.\n\nOrbs, Xai, zkSync Hyperchains, and the newly introduced Degen Chain on Arbitrum Orbit had been among the prominent entities in the L3 ecosystem. Additionally, solutions from L2 networks have contributed significantly to this landscape.\n\nWhile there had certainly been a buzz around layer 3 solutions, the sector had remained relatively small, with only four tokens associated with layer 3 protocols listed on CoinGecko.\n\nOffchain Labs, a leading company in the layer-2 space, had a different stance on the role of layer-3 solutions. Peter Haymond, Offchain Labs\u2019 senior partnership manager, believed that these protocols could offer significant benefits that did not detract from Ethereum\u2019s overall value.\n\nAmong the reasons cited were the reduced expenses associated with native bridging from L2 compared to L1, the economical nature of on-chain proving, the utilization of custom gas tokens, and the implementation of specialized state transition functions.\n\nPatrick McCorry, a researcher at the Arbitrum Foundation, had expressed surprise at Boiron\u2019s argument against layer 3s. McCorry, who had been taken aback by Boiron\u2019s stance, had shared his perspective on the matter, stating:\n\n\u201cL3s seem like a no-brainer, especially when it allows the L2 to eventually become a settlement layer (ie executing the bridge is cheaper) and ultimately relying on Ethereum as global ordering service + final judge of settlement.\u201d\n\nOn March 31st, Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helus Labs, voiced support for Boiron\u2019s viewpoint in a separate social media post. Mumtaz had written, \u201cL3s were centralized servers settling on other centralized servers (L2s) \u2014 controlled by multisigs.\u201d\n\nThe layer 3 discussion had been sparked by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in late 2022 when he posited that layer 3 solutions would serve a different role than pure scaling. Buterin had envisioned that L3s would provide \u201ccustomized functionality,\u201d introducing new capabilities and use cases beyond what layer 2s could offer.\n\nButerin had further elaborated on the potential role of layer 3s in a multi-layer blockchain ecosystem, arguing that a third layer only made sense if it offered a distinct function from layer 2s."

        "content": "Bitwise CIO Hougan wants a spot ETH ETF approval in December.\n\nHe argued that TradFi was too focused on Bitcoin, which could affect ETH ETFs.\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Bitwise has called for a spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF approval delay.\n\nInstead, the asset management firm, which recently submitted an amended filing for ETH ETF on the 28th of March, prefers an approval to be pushed to December 2024.\n\nIn an interview with Forbes, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan claimed that the asset management sector is too focused on Bitcoin [BTC] at the moment.\n\nErgo, according to the CIO, spot ETH ETF approval in May would deny the products enough interest to replicate BTC ETFs\u2019 success.\n\n\u201cI think the ether ETFs will be more successful if they launch in 12 months than if they launch in May.\u201d\n\nHougan added that,\n\n\u201cPart of me hopes that it\u2019s December or something like that because I think that would be better for the market.\u201d\n\nETH ETF May approval odds\n\nSo far, the ETH ETF applications of Grayscale, VanEck, Hashdex, and Ark 21Shares have been delayed. The final deadline for most of the early applications is in May.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have maintained low odds of ETH ETF approval in May.\n\nSimilarly, Bitwise CIO Hougan acknowledged the low odds of May approval but remained confident that ETH ETFs will eventually happen.\n\n\u201cI think the market\u2019s consensus that it will happen in May is possible but unlikely. I feel very confident we\u2019ll get an ether ETF.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Hougan reiterated that the recent Dencun upgrade was a big deal. But it didn\u2019t come up during his meet-ups with investors.\n\nThis made him believe it could be hard to shift focus from Bitcoin to Ethereum at the moment.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH extended its price consolidation around $3500. The asset was range-bound last week at the same price level.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen if it will attempt a breakout in early April, even as ETH ETF May approvals remain low."

If the downward trajectory continues, the supply crunch would aggravate further.\n\nTypically, such shortages help in bolstering prices in the long run, provided demand remains strong.\n\nAs evident, the supply plummeted throughout 2022 and 2023, but ETH still underperformed, owing to bear market-induced uncertainties.\n\nHowever, with improving sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies, coupled with ETH\u2019s own potential bullish catalysts like spot ETFs, the pursuit to grab the second-largest digital asset could only get stronger.\n\nETH whales busy stockpiling\n\nWhales, who are known for possessing a large chunk of ETH\u2019s supply, seem to be bullish on ETH as well.\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, whale transactions worth over $100k increased lately despite a price correction.\n\nThese transactions led to an uptick in the number of wallets holding between 1,000 to 10,000 coins.\n\nWhat can you expect from ETH?\n\nTo gain a better view of ETH\u2019s current market state, AMBCrypto analyzed some of its key technical indicators using TradingView.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) bounced above the neutral 50 line for the first time since mid-March. A move above 60 could consolidate bullish sentiments and pave way for its rise towards $4,000.\n\nThat being said, the On Balance Volume (OBV) failed to make higher peaks like price, moved sideways in the last 10 days. This suggested that the uptrend might stall.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

Such an event would strengthen bearish narratives.\n\nConversely, a move above zero could aid in further price gains."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is currently making headlines for its rapid growth over the last few months. However, according to analyst Crypto World, Bitcoin\u2019s current price trajectory has led to a surge in liquidations, hinting at a momentous shift in the market.\n\nHe suggests that historical price structures are being mirrored, similar to previous bullish cycles, particularly between 2020 and 2021. Despite short-term fluctuations, the broader trend remains bullish, providing opportunities for strategic entries during temporary pullbacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying over and over again here on the channel right now the price of Bitcoin is potentially repeating history because we\u2019re seeing an extremely similar price structure to what we saw in the last bull cycle back in 2020 going into 2021,\u201d the analyst said in his latest analysis.\n\nHe also notes, \u201cEven during a bullish trend, we can see short-term pullbacks from time to time, so just be aware if we\u2019re seeing a 10% pullback or a 20% pullback that\u2019s actually very normal price action to see even during a bullish trend.\u201d\n\nThe analyst said that when there are 10-20% pullbacks, there can be good chances to buy in for the short term, especially if you believe the bull market will keep going. Overall, the bigger picture still looks optimistic. Bitcoin\u2019s price range has oscillated between $68,000 and $69,000, with resistance at $71,500.\n\nAlso Check Out The : Analyst Reveals Top 3 Altcoin Picks For This Bull Run\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price action draws attention as it approaches critical support levels around $3,400 to $3,500. Resistance zones are identified at $4,100 and an all-time high of $4,900. With Ethereum forming a new pattern, investors anticipate a potential breakout, which could significantly impact market sentiment.\n\nSolana, another prominent player in the crypto space, is already attempting an upside breakout. Recent price movements indicate a bullish momentum, with resistance observed at $198 to $199. Analysts project a potential upside target of $217 if Solana sustains its upward trajectory."

        "content": "ETH\n\nThe Purge tackles issues such as escalating disk space requirements by implementing upgrades to declutter the network and simplify operations.\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contracts, contracts, is gearing up for a transformation with its latest initiative, \"The Purge.\" Recently, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin discussed the upcoming phases of the Ethereum \u2018Purge,\u2019 on X.\n\nWhat is the \u2018Purge?\u2019 Let\u2019s find out.\n\n\u200d\n\nEthereum's Evolutionary Journey\n\nOne of the primary pain points of Ethereum has been the soaring gas fees, making transactions prohibitively expensive for many users. As the network expanded, so did the disk space requirements, escalating maintenance costs.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism caused a heavy toll on the environment due to its substantial energy consumption.\n\nEthereum made headlines with its successful transition from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol on September 15, 2022. This shift laid the groundwork for further advancements in scalability, security, and sustainability.\n\nHowever, the journey towards Ethereum's full potential is far from over, with \"The Purge\" being a crucial phase in its ongoing development roadmap.\n\nThe Essence of The Purge\n\n\"The Purge\" encompasses a series of upgrades aimed at decluttering the Ethereum network and simplifying its architecture. By removing outdated network history and streamlining operations, Ethereum seeks to reduce historical data storage and alleviate the technical burden on node operators.\n\nThis upgrade, known as EIP-4444, sets a precedent for expiring historical data after a designated period, significantly reducing storage requirements. Nodes will have the option to reduce the size of historical data, optimizing resource utilization locally.\n\nEvolution of Syncing Mechanisms\n\nWith the implementation of The Purge, syncing mechanisms will transform. New nodes will adopt a checkpoint sync approach, starting from the most recent finalized checkpoint block rather than the genesis block. This streamlined syncing process enhances efficiency and reduces resource overhead.\n\nStreamlining Ethereum Clients\n\nComplementing The Purge, Ethereum clients will undergo comprehensive cleanup efforts to remove redundant code remnants from the PoW era. Recent Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) enhance code efficiency and security measures, paving the way for a more robust ecosystem.\n\nOptimizing Data Storage\n\nEIP-4444 introduces the concept of \"blobs\" for specific data storage, minimizing long-term storage requirements and facilitating easier node participation. Automatic removal of older blocks further alleviates storage constraints, enhancing scalability and accessibility.\n\nEnhancing Node Decentralization\n\nThe Purge promotes node decentralization by redistributing historical data across the network. While not all nodes will store complete historical data, decentralized solutions ensure accessibility and resilience, fortifying Ethereum's core tenets.\n\nRedefining Contract Functionality\n\nIn line with The Purge, Ethereum evaluates and optimizes precompile contracts to streamline functionality and mitigate consensus bugs. Simplified data structures and protocol enhancements boost Ethereum's efficiency and reliability.\n\nBy simplifying the network and staying true to its decentralized nature, Ethereum aims to unlock new possibilities."
