Lido currently commands 32% of all ether staked. This puts it just below a critical 33% threshold; if a single entity controls this much staked ETH, it could, theoretically, influence certain elements of how the chain operates."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nThe year 2023 has marked a shift in the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio. Despite Ethereum\u2019s substantial dollar value growth of 88%, it has significantly underperformed compared to Bitcoin, being down by 25% against the lead digital asset. The ratio currently sits at a precarious 0.053, teetering near year-to-date lows.\n\nThis trend invites speculation as to whether the crypto landscape may soon witness a further dip in Ethereum\u2019s performance. The BTC-ETH Dominance metric, an oscillator that tracks the macro outperformance trends between Bitcoin and Ethereum, provides some relevant insights. It gauges the Bitcoin Market Cap\u2019s dominance over the combined market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum, normalized around a long-term mean using a 0.765 factor.\n\nHigher values and uptrends point towards Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum, while lower values and downtrends signal Ethereum\u2019s superior performance. Currently, we are technically in an era of Ethereum dominance, with the metric at -0.016, which is the lowest level since Ethereum dominance began in May 2021. Traditionally, Ethereum tends to outperform Bitcoin during bull markets, raising the question: Could this be the first bull market where Bitcoin outpaces Ethereum?"

        "content": "Ethereum price is on a tear, consolidating within a bullish technical formation that promises more gains if sustained.\n\nETH could rise 5% to convert the $2,300 resistance level into a support floor before continuing its upward trajectory.\n\nThe bullish thesis will be invalidated upon a daily candlestick close below the $2,143 support level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has been consolidating within an ascending parallel channel since the broader market turned bullish around October 18, pushing north with key drivers including speculation of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launching in the market.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price breaks past $2,000 as BlackRock hints at filing for spot Ether ETF\n\nEthereum price eyes 5% rise above the $2,300 support\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is trading with a bullish bias, sustained by an ascending parallel channel. This technical formation promises and delivers more gains for the asset as long as it remains within its confines. However, based on the current outlook, the largest cryptocurrency by trading volume looks ready for a breakout after one attempt already.\n\nTechnical indicators show that Ethereum price still has some upside potential, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) inclined north at 69 to show momentum is still rising. Its position below 70 is good, suggesting ETH is still not overbought nor ripe for a correction.\n\nSimilarly, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains in positive territory with green histogram bars. This points to a strong presence of bulls in the Ether market and could bode well for Ethereum price, depending on how the bulls play their hands.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Ethereum price breakout above the upper boundary of the chart pattern, confirmed by a flip of the $2,300 resistance level into a support level. This would set the tone for Ether to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn-chain metrics support Ethereum price bullish outlook\n\nMultiple on-chain metrics support the bullish thesis for Ethereum price, including the dwindling deposit transactions and the volume of exchange inflows. As a spike in deposit transactions would indicate a rise in short-term selling pressure, the absence thereof shows investors do not have the intention to sell.\n\nThis outlook is corroborated by dwindling exchange inflows, suggesting investors are not moving their ETH holdings to exchanges. There is no effective intention to sell in the near future.\n\nETH Santiment: Deposit transactions, exchange inflows\n\nFurther, the Tether (USDT) stablecoin market capitalization is rising, suggesting fresh capital inflow into the Ether market, interpreted as the intention to buy. The ensuing buying pressure could inspire a prolonged uptrend for Ethereum price.\n\nETH Santiment: USDT market capitalization\n\nConversely, if selling pressure increases, possibly as investors start booking early profits after such a striking climb, Ethereum price could pull south. In such a directional bias, ETH could lose the confluence support between the midline of the channel and the horizontal line at $2,143. A break and close below this level would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nFurther south, Ethereum price could extend the fall, potentially going as low as the $2,029 support before a foray into the supply zone turned bullish breaker. A decisive candlestick close below the midline of this zone at $1,935 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend."

        "content": "BTC crossed $42,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid rising market optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF would receive approval.\n\nBitcoin and ether once rose and fell in near lockstep, but no more.\n\nThough the prices of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value have both climbed in 2023, they have taken somewhat different paths, with BTC skyrocketing 145% year-to-date and ether jumping a still strong but lesser 85%.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin cracked the $42,000 threshold for the first time since early April 2022 when the Terra ecosystem started to collapse, while ether rose above $2,200 for the first time since May 2022, according to Coinmarketcap data. BTC was recently trading at about $41,950, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nRead more: 12 Charts That Tell the Story of Crypto in 2023\n\nIn its newsletter on Monday, Kaiko Research, which tracks crypto market data, attributed the gap in no small part to rising optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve applications for long elusive spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nKaiko noted that BTC volatility has declined significantly since the summer not long after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and other financial powerhouses submitted their spot bitcoin ETF applications. The firm used the Sharpe Ratio, a measure of compensation that investors receive for taking on more risk where a higher ratio equals a better risk-adjusted return. BTC outperformed most traditional assets, including gold, and Ethereum.\n\nRead more: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $4.6 Billion First Day Trading Volume\n\n\u201cThe difference in risk-adjusted returns can largely be chalked up to BTC\u2019s superior price performance this year. The ratio was about 0.072 at the start of the year and is now 0.053,\u201d Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey told Unchained in an email. \u201cETH has likely had a softer rally because the main catalyst/narrative \u2013 a potential spot BTC ETF \u2013 directly relates to BTC.\u201d\n\nBitcoin, which has a market capitalization of $812 billion compared to the $267 billion for Ethereum, is often hailed as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and viewed as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. As a result, bitcoin\u2019s price has tended to be more sensitive to global economic factors and policy changes such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments last week that another interest rate hike wasn\u2019t currently in discussion \u2013 a favorable sign for the asset.\n\nSpot ETF Applications Favor BTC\n\nThirteen companies have filed spot bitcoin ETF applications, including Grayscale, which hopes to turn its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The SEC\u2019s thinking on the Grayscale situation remains unclear and could delay that potential product\u2019s approval, although in an interview with Unchained, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart reiterated his belief that he expects the SEC to approve the applications en masse between Jan. 8 and 10.\n\nThe SEC is currently considering seven applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. While a BlackRock application last month caused ETH to have a stronger rally than BTC, there\u2019s general sentiment that bitcoin has an easier road to approval. This is partly because bitcoin is older, has a larger market capitalization and has a more straightforward use case. Ethereum, in contrast, is a more complex platform for decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nOn Monday, BlackRock and Bitwise filed amendments to their applications, a further indication of progress, Seyffart wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, another measure of crypto market optimism continued to point upward as inflows to digital asset investment products rose for a 10th consecutive week, according to research group CoinShares. The rise underscores institutional investors\u2019 interest in the asset.\n\nCoinShares data showed that bitcoin had $133 million in inflows last week, bringing its year-to-date total to $1.68 billion. But the group also found that Ethereum had just $31 million of inflows over the same period, bringing its net flows into the positive for the first time this year.\n\nIn an email to Unchained, Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, echoed Carey\u2019s comments. \u201cBitcoin has outperformed Ethereum in large part because many are anticipating that these spot BTC ETFs will likely get approved fairly soon,\u201d Levin wrote. \u201cAn ETH ETF might also be on the horizon, though it\u2019s less definitive than the Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of capital getting allocated to Bitcoin and this, in turn, is having an outsize impact on momentum.\u201d"

The latest charts illustrate an ascending trajectory that has left many investors and analysts contemplating the possibility of the ETH/USD chart reaching the coveted $3,000 mark in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining the daily chart for Ethereum, we see a series of higher lows and higher highs, which is the go-to indication of a bull market. The price has now surpassed the dynamic resistance provided by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.\n\nETH/USD chart by TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the recent uptick, the volume behind the movement is descending, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. This pattern often precedes a consolidation phase, where the price stabilizes before making a definitive move. Investors should watch for a possible consolidation, which could confirm the sustainability of the recent breakout.\n\nAdding to the market dynamics, the rise of Layer 2 solutions (L2s) has been gradually increasing Ethereum network fees. While L2s are designed to enhance scalability and reduce costs on the Ethereum network, the transition period could lead to a slow but steady climb in fees. This rise could potentially lead to a stalemate situation in network activity if users begin to balk at higher costs, influencing the ETH price as the network's utility comes under scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the technical front, the relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, yet another sign that the market could be due for a pause. A retraction or sideways movement would allow the RSI to reset, providing a healthier foundation for future growth.\n\nThe confluence of these technical indicators and the fundamental backdrop of rising network fees due to the adoption of L2s presents a complex picture for Ethereum. While the current price action looks promising for a test of $3,000, the underlying volume and network fee trends suggest that a period of consolidation or even a minor pullback might be on the horizon before any further significant upward movements are observed."

That\u2019s a stablecoin issued by Societe Generale FORGE. The transaction on the public Ethereum blockchain is part of a new joint experiment. In July AXA IM was a judge in SocGen Forge\u2019s tokenization hackathon.\n\nCoinVertible isn\u2019t designed as an average stablecoin, but instead for institutional usage. As in this case, there\u2019s a need for trusted on-chain settlement assets.\n\n\u201cThe aim of this initiative, carried out in collaboration with Societe Generale \u2013 FORGE, was to enable us to experiment the use of a stablecoin as a settlement asset to purchase a digital bond,\u201d said Laurence Arnold, Head of Innovation and Strategic Initiatives. \u201cOur ultimate objective is to optimise our existing processes by adopting the most advanced technologies, so we can offer the best possible services to our clients.\u201d\n\nSocGen\u2019s first digital green bond\n\nMeanwhile, the digital bond reports the carbon footprint of the security token issuance infrastructure on chain. Societe Generale issued a \u20ac10 million bond, with AXA IM taking half and Generali Investments the balance. It\u2019s a three year, senior preferred unsecured bond.\n\nDespite the stablecoin\u2019s launch in April, this is the first real use of it. The original stablecoin had zero transactions and was burned in October and updated to a new contract to support instant settlement. AXA IM\u2019s purchase of the stablecoin and transfer in exchange for the bond took place on Friday. SocGen Forge holds \u20ac10 million of the stablecoin, with another \u20ac500,000 issued to an unknown wallet last week.\n\nSince Friday there have also been some small transactions involving the Bitstamp exchange.\n\nAXA IM previously participated in the European Investment Bank Ethereum bond that was issued on Ethereum via SocGen FORGE\u2019s infrastructure.

This will result in more than 10x growth based on its current price.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin ETF Token presale recently hit $2m as analysts provide 10-100x price predictions.\n\nUnprecedented Institutional Captial Anticipated as Key Price Driver\n\nEthereum\u2019s price experienced a notable spike in November when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled down on its crypto efforts, filing for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would be listed on Nasdaq, opening the door to a broad new audience previously deterred from buying ETH for technical, security, or liquidity reasons.\n\nThis would propel cryptocurrency to a legitimate investment opportunity, even for traditional investors. As such, it is no surprise that Ethereum\u2019s price is rising in anticipation, currently at $2.09K, up 15% in the last month.\n\nYet, some analysts are significantly bullish on where Ethereum could be headed in the upcoming market cycle.\n\nIn a breakdown on TheStreet, prominent analyst Austin Arnold said, \u201cThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, is now backing both Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d suggesting this is of monumental importance for the assets\u2019 future.\n\nHe then considered BlackRock\u2019s assets under management (AUM), how much it may allocate to the ETH ETF, and how this could impact the asset\u2019s market cap.\n\nArnold then discussed a bull case following the ETF approval, contemplating Ethereum could climb to highs of $41,000. However, he stated, \u201cI do not see Ethereum getting that far.\u201d\n\nInstead, the analyst sees a more realistic prediction being $28,000, or $10,000.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s $28,000, $45,000, $10,000, I\u2019d be happy with anything, but I\u2019m a long-term holder,\u201d Arnold concluded.\n\nOne of the factors that he highlighted was the difference in Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s structure, tokenomics, and utility. He explained, \u201cOne\u2019s digital gold, it\u2019s aiming to be a store of value. While Ethereum is like digital oil, used to power a global, decentralized supercomputer, build apps. Just like a car needs gasoline to be able to run, Ethereum is the gas that makes the system work.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also referenced Ethereum\u2019s burn mechanism, which makes the token deflationary by destroying a small part of each transaction fee. Coupled with the incoming ETF liquidity inflows, Arnold believes this could significantly bolster its price.\n\nHowever, he understands there is a ceiling to how far it can go in the next market cycle. \u201c$10,000 ETH is the most realistic scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nThis represents less than a 5x gain from its current price. While this is a significant return for those with large portfolios, it is unlikely to render sufficient returns for those with limited financial resources.\n\nOne alternative with a lot of upside potential is Bitcoin ETF Token, a new trending presale that has raised over $2.1 million in three weeks amid the BlackRock hype.\n\nStake-to-Earn Bitcoin ETF Token ICO Hits $2M Milestone\n\nBitcoin ETF Token is a compelling new project that rewards holders in line with key Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nThe project has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned as Bitcoin ETFs reach five main targets, creating a sense of scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) when the hype is highest.\n\nIt also features a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each milestone. This incentivizes people to hold longer and ensures explosive price action following the project\u2019s IEO.\n\nThese factors make Bitcoin ETF Token deflationary, introducing the scarcity principle into the project, which has been a key driver for Bitcoin\u2019s parabolic price action since its launch in 2009.\n\nAnother exciting factor is its staking mechanism, rewarding its community and incentivizing users to lock up their tokens, further limiting the available supply.\n\nHolders can garner a 118% staking APY, but they must be quick because this decreases as more users stake their tokens.\n\nThe project has experienced significant success lately, with top analysts providing massively bullish predictions. Jacob Bury speculates it will 10x after its launch, while Crypto Boy believes it could 100x.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

The Sandbox B.I.G. experience, dubbed \u201cBreakin\u2019 B.I.G.,\u201d allows players to meet the rapper\u2019s non-playable avatar likeness in a \u201c2D, arcade-style world\u201d and navigate various quests as an up-and-coming rap star, according to the announcement.\n\nQuests include tasks like helping out around the virtual Brooklyn community and confronting B.I.G.\u2019s rivals in The Sandbox, to name a few.\n\n\u201cNo artist represents the style of the 90s more than Biggie,\u201d said Notorious B.I.G.

        "content": "The quest to quantify blockchain decentralization has led to various metrics, with the Nakamoto Coefficient being one of the prominent measures. However, in the recent listings of blockchains by their degree of decentralization, Cardano was notably absent from the top ranks, a position that has sparked curiosity and debate within the crypto community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano is often distinguished from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based chains due to its unique network structure and operational mechanics. Unlike Ethereum, which runs on the EVM, allowing for interoperability and similar structures across various networks, Cardano employs a different approach with its Ouroboros consensus algorithm.\n\nOuroboros is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, but it diverges from the standard PoS mechanisms. It is designed to achieve consensus in a more energy-efficient and scalable way. This dedication to a scientific philosophy in its protocol development sets Cardano apart, which may contribute to why it is often considered separately from other EVM-compatible chains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe distinctiveness of Cardano's architecture is complemented by its layered structure. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) and the computation layer (Cardano CL) operate independently, which differentiates its operational functions from those of other blockchains where these layers are typically intertwined.\n\nCardano's network also emphasizes a community-driven approach to governance and development. The project's catalyst funds and the Voltaire phase, which aims to introduce a fully decentralized decision-making process, are testaments to its commitment to a high degree of decentralization, albeit not necessarily captured by the Nakamoto Coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, Cardano's method of staking and block production involves a randomized process for electing slot leaders, which is different from Ethereum's process. This adds another layer of complexity when comparing the two networks based on the number of entities that can collectively shut down or control the network, as the Nakamoto Coefficient attempts to measure."

        "content": "For the major period of November, the Ethereum (ETH) coin witnessed high volatility leading to a sideways trend between the $2,143 and $1,910 price levels. However, this consolidation came after a significant rally indicating the buyers could have an opportunity to recuperate the bullish momentum after the further rally. Thus, a recent breakout from the range barrier sets the ETH price to further rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Data Indicates Roadblock Ahead\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill ETH Price Hit $3000?\n\nA bullish breakout from the wedge pattern would set a directional uptrend\n\nThe rising price could face intense supply around $2250.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.2 Billion, indicating a 78% gain.\n\nCoinciding with the Bitcoin price ascent over the $38,000 mark, a renewed sense of optimism has begun to permeate the crypto market. Responding to this positive shift, the ETH price rebounded from the psychologically significant $2,000 mark, registering a 7.8% weekly increase to its current trading price of $2,153.\n\nDuring this rally, the Ethereum price surpassed the immediate resistance of $2,133, suggesting that buyers are poised to drive the price even higher. Despite a modest intraday loss of 0.5%, a retest of this breached resistance could confirm its role as a new support level, underpinning the buyer\u2019s ability to sustain higher price levels.\n\nHowever, with only a 3.5% increase, the ETH price is approaching a significant resistance level formed by the wedge pattern. Historical trends indicate that this trendline has often led to increased selling pressure and notable price declines.\n\nTherefore, a conclusive breakout above this barrier is crucial for confirming a more robust uptrend. Should the Ethereum price successfully navigate this challenge, its price could potentially soar by 50%, reaching around $3,400.\n\nBTC vs ETH Performance\n\nLong-term comparative analysis between Bitcoin and Ethereum reveals that both cryptocurrencies gained considerable momentum since mid-October. However, the Bitcoin price has demonstrated a more substantial recovery, characterized by a consistent pattern of higher highs and lows. On the other hand, the ETH price has faced some challenges, particularly noticeable supply pressure around the $2,200 mark.\n\nBollinger band: The uptick in the Bollinger band indicator reflects that buyers are aggressive and ready to buy ETH at a higher price.\n\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence: a bullish crossover between the MACD (blue) and signal(orange) line, accentuates a recovery sentiment return in this asset.\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "title": "Mantle offers \u2018mETH\u2019 to the masses, as a \u2018lighter weight Lido\u2019 - Blockworks",
        "content": "After nine months in development, Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle has launched its second core product, Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP).\n\nThis new protocol, deployed on Mantle and Ethereum mainnet, introduces a non-custodial and permissionless ether liquid staking solution, Mantle Staked Ether (mETH).\n\nMETH acts as a value-accumulating receipt token within the Mantle LSP, very similar to Lido\u2019s staked ether (stETH). Mantle aims to achieve the highest sustainable core yield by exploring maximal extractable value. It also shares yield from the Mantle treasury, according to a statement released Monday.\n\nThe idea for mETH came from Mantle \u201calchemist\u201d Jordi Alexander, chief information officer at Selini Capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just created a lighter weight, more modern Lido,\u201d Alexander told Blockworks. He champions the idea of offering a native staking yield on an Ethereum layer-2. The premise is \u201cwe should do all of DeFi, but first start by having the 5% yield,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis is the same promise of the planned Blast layer-2, which has attracted deposits of ether (ETH) and stablecoins now topping $750 million over the past two weeks.\n\nBlast, despite its rapid growth and ambitious plans, faces scrutiny over its security model and the centralization concerns related to its reliance on Lido.\n\nRead more: Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate\n\n\u201cKudos to the Blast team because it\u2019s the same idea that I had but just a very different implementation,\u201d said Alexander, who has been advising Mantle since March and serves on investment and treasury committees.\n\n\u201cI was pretty excited [when Blast launched] because they\u2019re educating the market on this idea\u201d of having native staking yield available for DeFi on a layer-2, he said.\n\nThe Mantle LSP development process represents a more traditional, structured approach with a focus on security and integration within its ecosystem.\n\nThe team decided to build a solution from scratch, but also talked to Lido about the idea of white labeling their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe talked to everybody \u2014 we literally went through every single [liquid staking team] out there \u2014 including Lido of course \u2014 we had multiple chats with them to decide [if] there [is] a way that we can take the easy way out,\u201d Alexander said, adding \u201cwe decided to go the hard route, and it\u2019s taken many months to do it properly and get all the audits and everything.\u201d\n\nThe various components of the Mantle LSP have been audited by Hexens, MixBytes, Secure3 and Verilog, and the contract upgradeability is the responsibility of the Mantle Security Council, a 6 of 12 multisig, which is also used for maintenance of the Mantle Network itself.\n\n\u201cIf you trust Mantle, it\u2019s the same security,\u201d Alexander said.\n\nUnlike Blast, Mantle LSP doesn\u2019t force anyone to stake or bridge. METH will work just fine on Ethereum mainnet and Alexander stressed that it is an independent product from the Mantle Network.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some people that just want to stay on [Ethereum] mainnet and we do want to cater to them as well,\u201d but, he adds, \u201cI expect that most of it eventually will get incentivized to move because we\u2019ll make it really juicy to ship it over.\u201d\n\nThese incentives can be seen as a vampire attack on Lido, which Alexander says should appeal to members of the Ethereum community concerned over excessive Lido centralization.\n\nWhat\u2019s cooking in \u201cthe mETH lab\u201d?\n\nThe Mantle team has a number of ideas in the works to expand upon the LSP\u2019s use within its network, which will be proposed to holders of the MNT governance token in the coming weeks.\n\nMNT is also used to pay transaction fees on the Mantle Network.\n\nAlexander originally considered mETH as a good candidate for the Mantle gas token \u2014 \u201clike a self-replenishing gas,\u201d he said \u2014 but ultimately Mantle\u2019s mainnet launch schedule led to the introduction of MNT.\n\nThe team might consider a dual gas token model, make use of account abstraction to reduce user friction, or outline other new utilities for MNT.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have it be sort of like ATOM where you get airdrops and it\u2019s kind of like a launch pool token,\u201d Alexander said, referring to the native asset of the Cosmos Hub.\n\nHe agrees with the critique that Ethereum has too many layer-2 networks proliferating, suggesting that most lack a creative new idea.\n\n\u201cIs there something unique or some imagination that\u2019s gone into it instead of just deploying a tenth version of Aave and just doing the same USDT pair or whatever?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\n\nAnd as for the name and its natural association with illicit drugs?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to just lean into it.

        "content": "Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko made a post on the X app warning the public about sparking a cold war between Ethereum (ETH) and other protocols including Solana (SOL) which are generally referred to as \u2018ETH Killer\u201d\n\nSOL and ETH Can Co-Exist\n\nIn Yakovenko\u2019s opinion, pushing such narratives against Ethereum is lame as it harms the ecosystem. He suggested that protocols could coexist without challenges or threats of killing each other.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cPareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies,\u201d the Solana co-founder said.\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nFurthermore, Anatoly expressed positivity in a future where \u201cDanksharding,\u201d a technology that allows blockchain technology to add cheaper blocks, will have enough bandwidth that accommodate all of Solana\u2019s data. To put it in perspective, danksharding is an Ethereum rollup scaling method where transactional throughput is expanded through the provision of additional storage space for roll-up transactions.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s statement on Ethereum underscores the fact that SOL and ETH can coexist and even overlap without any inconveniences.\n\nSolana Founder Douses ETH Rivalry Push\n\nDespite the growing industry eulogy for Solana, Yakovenko has warned the community members against instigating unhealthy rivalry with the Ethereum protocol.\n\nThis was when MakerDAO Co-founder and CEO Rune Christensen announced plans to fork the protocol\u2019s NewChain on the Solana blockchain, away from Ethereum. The news sparked some reactions from Solana proponents who saw the transition as a battle of the best.\n\nYakovenko immediately pointed out that it was a general win for open source. \u201cI really hope that people in the Solana community don\u2019t use this as some cudgel to attack Ethereum,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIn October, one Ethereum community member identified as jebus.eth tried to take a jab at Solana by referring to it as a \u201cCoallition of poors and wealthy ppl who don\u2019t understand where value actually comes from or how to create it, just that the things I want should be cheap.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Solana co-founder was quick to respond to him, emphasizing the fact that his protocol is a pursuit of an entirely stateless digital realm, where unhindered communication and transactions flow freely among the people, liberated from the control of capitalist middlemen and government surveillance.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "title": "Mantle introduces mETH liquid staking protocol, expanding its Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Mantle, the DAO-led web3 ecosystem, today unveiled its Mantle Liquid Staking Protocol (LSP) as a key addition to the Mantle Ecosystem, offering users a novel way to engage with Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) validator network, according to a statement shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nThe Mantle LSP is a permissionless and non-custodial Ethereum (ETH) liquid staking protocol, functioning on Ethereum L1 and governed by Mantle. It stands as the second core product of the Mantle Ecosystem, following the Mantle Network L2. Mantle posits that the introduction of Mantle Staked Ether (mETH), a value-accumulating receipt token, is a pivotal step in their protocol.\n\nMantle detailed that the genesis of Mantle LSP began with a proposal in a Mantle forum on July 14, 2023. Following the acceptance of the Mantle Governance Proposal MIP-25, the staking of Mantle Treasury ETH was sanctioned, leading to the phased deployment of Mantle LSP. This process culminated in the protocol\u2019s full operational launch on Dec. 4, transitioning it into a Permissionless Mode.\n\nMantle LSP distinguishes itself by offering instant and sustainable rewards. Users staking ETH receive mETH, a token embodying their staked value and accumulated rewards, while also unlocking additional yield opportunities within the Mantle Ecosystem. Mantle states that the ETH to mETH exchange rate is deterministically calculated, thus mitigating the impact of stake size on slippage. Furthermore, mETH is available for trade on various exchanges, with its pricing governed by market dynamics.\n\nMantle emphasizes that their protocol underscores a commitment to user experience, security, and yield optimization. Mantle states its LSP features a streamlined architecture, focusing on the ETH to mETH conversion process on L1, and avoids complexities associated with other PoS tokens and chains. The protocol\u2019s design incorporates robust risk management strategies, including non-custodial core smart contracts and off-chain services that impose strict risk limits. Additionally, Mantle LSP\u2019s security framework involves dividing responsibilities among various roles, ensuring the safeguarding of staked ETH within smart contract addresses.\n\nWith the launch of Mantle LSP, Mantle intends to enhance its DeFi offerings by exploring the adoption of mETH across various applications within its ecosystem and beyond. This expansion aims to bolster the utility and efficiency of mETH, contributing significantly to Mantle\u2019s growth in the DeFi space.\n\nThe broader Mantle ecosystem, anchored in Ethereum technology, now includes the Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) solution, Mantle Governance, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and Mantle Treasury, one of the largest on-chain treasuries. The ecosystem is facilitated by the Mantle token (MNT), which serves as a product and governance token.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "This week, the global cryptocurrency market cap soared 5% to $1.49 trillion, marking its highest point since the Terra-induced collapse of last May. Several assets \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Celestia (TIA) \u2014 registered impressive gains.\n\nBitcoin nears $40,000\n\nBitcoin has been on a rampage since breaking out of the consolidation in early October. The premier crypto has continued to register impressive bullish closes, and this week was no different. With a 5.41% increase over the past seven days, Bitcoin is on track to record its seventh consecutive bullish week.\n\nBTC price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nThis streak of bullish closes began in mid-October when the asset changed hands at the $27,000 territory. Amid increased optimism from sustained ETF discussions, Bitcoin has extended the wins to seven straight weeks.\n\nThis week was less challenging than most, as BTC only registered two days of mild intraday declines. These declines came up on Nov. 27 (0.56%) and Nov. 30 (0.37%). Other days recorded bullish gains, but Dec. 1 stood out, as BTC surged 2.54%, marking its highest intraday gain for the week.\n\nThis Dec. 1 rally brought BTC the closest to the $39,000 territory in 17 months. The asset spiked to $38,983 but witnessed bearish resistance. BTC showed resilience, closing Dec. 1 at $38,688 to have another go at $39,000 the following day.\n\nThis second push was successful, helping Bitcoin reclaim $39,000 for the first time since the Terra implosion of last May. Bitcoin has built on this rally, changing hands at $39,489 at the reporting time, with the $40,000 price threshold its next target.\n\nYou might also like: Hong Kong, Singapore attract increasing crypto VC funding\n\nEthereum hits 17-month high\n\nBitcoin\u2019s uptrend favorably impacted Ethereum\u2019s price, as both assets maintained their close correlation this week. Ethereum started the week with mixed signals, dropping 1.71% on Nov. 27, but rising 0.99% the next day. Nov. 29 also brought another decline, with a 0.90% slide.\n\nETH price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s bullish story began on Nov. 30 despite BTC\u2019s 0.37% drop. ETH rallied 1.12% that day, extending this bullish run to the new month. The asset gained 1.72% on Dec. 1, with its largest intraday gain amounting to a 3.75% surge on Dec. 2.\n\nThe Dec. 2 rally was Ethereum\u2019s major boost this week, as the asset leveraged it to hit a 17-month high of $2,184. Despite facing a roadblock at this new yearly peak, the bulls retained their hold, keeping Ethereum above $2,100 at the close of day. Currently trading for $2,164, ETH is up 4.97% this week.\n\nCelestia clinches new ATH in 60% weekly gain\n\nCelestia was not left out in the market-wide uptrend this week. While Bitcoin and Ethereum flashed mixed signals at the start of the week, TIA went full-on bullish, surging 8.17% on Nov. 27 and 6.06% on Nov. 28. The following day was not very favorable, leading to a 3.53% decline.\n\nTIA price \u2013 Dec. 3 | Source: Trading View\n\nHowever, these drops did nothing to negate the ongoing uptrend. Celestia rallied by a massive 42% from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, recording three consecutive days of bullish momentum. Amid this momentum, TIA began recording new all-time highs on Dec. 2. The asset\u2019s latest ATH was $9.31 today.\n\nCelestia\u2019s massive uptrend put it among the top gainers over the past seven days. The asset is up 61% this week, securing third among the largest gainers. Celestia is facing a 0.48% drop today, but the asset has held up well above $8.5, currently changing hands at $8.81."

        "content": "Spanish officials detained Alejandro Cao de Benos, a Spanish aristocrat.\n\nHe allegedly enlisted Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to help North Korea evade sanctions.\n\nSpanish officials detained on Thursday a pro-North Korea political activist aristocrat accused of aiding North Korea in circumventing international sanctions through crypto, according to a statement by the Spanish police.\n\nAlejandro Cao de Benos, the founder of advocacy group Korea Friendship Association, was indicted last year by US authorities for allegedly recruiting Ethereum researcher Virgil Griffith to unlawfully provide crypto services to North Korea.\n\n\u201cSuch accusations are totally false. There is not a single piece of evidence that proves that I hired or solicited the services of Virgil Griffith,\u201d Cao de Benos said in a public statement posted Sunday on X.\n\nThe police said investigation for his location began in mid-October, when the agents received a tipoff from Interpol indicating that Cao de Benos could be in Spain.\n\nCao de Benos was released after a one-day detention.\n\n\u201cIt is a disgrace that the US empire abuses Interpol and Spain to carry out what is purely political persecution,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum researcher Virgil Griffith\n\nGriffith, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, was arrested in 2019 after a trip to North Korea to allegedly consult the regime on how to use crypto to evade international sanctions.\n\nHis keynote speech at the Pyongyang conference allegedly contained information on how to bypass sanctions, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut Griffith\u2019s advocates and his legal team have argued that the presentation did no more than recapitulate widely available information, which could be readily accessed online.\n\nGriffith\u2019s lawyer said that the trip was \u201cthe culmination of Virgil\u2019s unique and unfortunate curiosity and obsession with North Korea.\u201d\n\nHe received a 63-month prison sentence last year after pleading guilty to a charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The act forbids US citizens from exporting goods, services, or technology to North Korea without a licence from the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nHis lawyer told the Wall Street Journal that Griffith was \u201csincerely remorseful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Emms dodges the bullet\n\nBritish national Christopher Emms was also charged last year, alongside Cao de Benos, with the conspiracy to help North Korea access crypto. He had attended the same conference as Griffith.\n\nIn June, Emms said he received political asylum in Russia.\n\nAppearing on Russian state media RT yesterday, Emms called Cao de Benos\u2019 detention \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and said the \u201cUS government doesn\u2019t like when someone stands up to them.\u201d\n\nEmms told Blockworks last year that Cao de Benos contacted him through LinkedIn and invited him to the conference in Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cI did the typical crypto bro thing: I googled it. I checked the Foreign Office website as a UK citizen. I checked the UN website and I didn\u2019t see that speaking at a conference in North Korea was breaking any laws,\u201d Emms said.\n\nThe North Korea trip was \u201cincredibly naive,\u201d Emms said, but \u201cthe way we [the crypto industry] approached things was so different than we would right now. There was a lack of clarity on so many things.\u201d\n\nCrypto: North Korea\u2019s \u2018treasure sword\u2019\n\nNorth Korea calls crypto its \u201ctreasure sword,\u201d according to David Maxwell, senior fellow at the think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, who spoke with DL News in April.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s crypto arm known as Lazarus Group has stolen at least $3.4 billion in crypto since emerging in 2007, according to calculations by DL News.\n\n\u201cAll the money [the North Korean hackers] cash out goes to fund their missile programme,\u201d Erin Plante, vice-president of investigations at Chainalysis, told DL News in April. A report by Recorded Future last week said that North Korea loots enough crypto to fund almost half of its military budget.\n\nLast year, Lazarus hacked a record a $625 million in crypto, raiding the web3 game Axie Infinity.\n\nThat attack, said Plante, was \u201ca turning-point event where suddenly the US National Security Council cared and wanted to hear about it.\u201d"

        "title": "How a Photographer Missed Out on $8 Million for This Portrait of a Crypto Billionaire - PetaPixel",
        "content": "Being a freelance photographer is not easy. Chasing invoices, dealing with late payments, the list goes on, but very few have ever missed out on a payment of $8 million that was rightfully theirs.\n\nBut that\u2019s what happened to photographer Andrew Miller after he took a portrait of Vitalik Buterin, who co-founded the cryptocurrency Ethereum and went on to become the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaire.\n\nLong before Russian-Canadian programmer Buterin made the Forbes rich list, Miller, a self-confessed gamer geek, had taken a keen interest in the enigmatic programmer and approached him with a portrait idea around the same time Buterin was launching Ethereum. Buterin agreed, but back then he was cash-strapped so one of his investors came up with the idea of paying Miller in the upcoming Ethereum currency.\n\nMiller paid for the shoot at his own expense \u2014 which included dinner, a photo assistant, and a makeup artist \u2014 and agreed to be paid in the initial coin offering so long as it was the equivalent of the $1,200 CAD ($886) that Miller deemed to be the value of his photo shoot.\n\nThis is Where it Gets Interesting\n\nMiller tells PetaPixel that he was supposed to have been paid for the copyright of the photo during the initial coin offering when the price of Etherum was $0.31, meaning the photographer ought to have received somewhere between 3,225 and 3,600 Ether. Today, 3,600 Ether is worth nearly $8 million (10.8 million CAD).\n\n\u201cI said if they started using it commercially they could pay me in Ether at the initial coin offering amount. They agreed in principle and would investigate how to get the coins to me through their execution of the offering. It was still a new process for them and theoretical,\u201d Miller says.\n\n\u201cI met them in Vancouver two weeks later at the 2014 Coinfest and hung around for lunch and other gatherings. I queried them on how payment would play out and Anthony [an investor] set me up with a Bitcoin wallet to demonstrate how one would send coins back and forth,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cIt was always my understanding that I would receive Ether at the initial coin offering. I just thought that in the end, they didn\u2019t use the image commercially. Everything was not traditionally public and the Ethereum website was sparse for photos.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, Miller never received the cryptocurrency and after losing contact with Buterin, he was oblivious that his photo had been disseminated commercially. It was being used in news articles, memes, fan art, and even being sold as knock-off NFTs with zero credit given to Miller.\n\nDespite numerous attempts to reach Buterin, Miller has not heard from the Ethereum co-founder and now says he is \u201ctrapped in a situation where there is no response from Vitalik or the Ethereum organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy portraits appear to have been instrumental in shaping the positive perception of Vitalik and contributed in some small part to Ethereum\u2019s rise,\u201d Miller writes in an article for DIY Photography.\n\n\u201cToday, I am battling to gain attribution and recognition after the portraits became famous, leaving my name unspoken. The history of what I did for Vitalik was untold, and anyone looking back can see its value given the timing and what transpired afterwards. Any joy I took in seeing my photos fulfilling the role I originally intended was quelled when I learned that they had been used commercially by the Ethereum co-founders, who never fulfilled their end of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nMiller stresses he has never issued an invoice, largely because if he does, Canadian law requires him to declare it as income immediately and pay income and sales tax on it regardless whether he\u2019s received the payment or not.\n\nPetaPixel has reached out to Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum for comment but did not hear back ahead of publication.\n\nMore of Miller\u2019s work can be found on his website and Instagram.\n\nImage credits: Photographs by Andrew Miller."

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano blockchain, has recently expressed that Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, has an 18% chance of becoming a prisoner.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s latest negative remark towards the Ethereum figure follows Buterin\u2019s repeated appearance on a ranking of the most influential figures in the crypto community.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s 18% Chance Prison Sentence\n\nIn a recent tweet, CoinDesk disclosed that Vitalik Buterin has emerged four times since 2014 as the Most Influential crypto personality in its ranking. Buterin has appeared more times than other prominent personalities, such as Do Kwon of Terra Luna, Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of Binance, Gary Gensler of the U.S. SEC, Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, and Jack Dorsey of Twitter (now X).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, former Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase and the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, made three appearances on CoinDesk\u2019s ranking. Aside from the two, all other crypto-based personalities have made just two appearances.\n\nGiven Vitalik Buterin\u2019s repeated emergence, CoinDesk posted a question seeking opinions from the crypto community on whether Buterin would make the fifth appearance in the 2023 ranking.\n\nCharles Hoskinson weighed in on the conversation. However, instead of commenting on Vitalik Buterin\u2019s influential status, he tilted the discussion in another direction. In particular, Hoskinson remarked:\n\n\n\n\u201cAppearing on Coindesk\u2019s most influential list carries an 18 percent chance of a prison sentence,\u201d teasing it as some \u2018fun fact.\u2019\n\nFast Fact: appearing on Coindesk's most influential list carries an 18 percent chance of a prison sentence https://t.co/SdAOqcPOPQ \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 3, 2023\n\nNotably, the foundation of Hoskinson\u2019s \u201c18% chance of prison\u201d is that of the 16 crypto personalities in the CoinDesk ranking, three have had devastating legal encounters with prison sentences in sight.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThree of 16 is 18.75%. Therefore, Hoskinson argued that each individual on CoinDesk\u2019s personality rankings has an 18% chance of facing a prison sentence.\n\nCrypto Community Reacts\n\nMeanwhile, some crypto community members argued Hoskinson appears jealous because he has failed to feature in the ranks of the most influential crypto personalities. Crypto Youtuber Lex Blazer remarked:\n\n\u201cI know CoinDesk is biased against you, but damn, not even once? How many blockchain features has Cardano pioneered at scale?\u201d\n\nOthers contended that the Cardano founder was intentionally refusing to acknowledge that \u201cVitalik is the greatest of all time (GOAT).\u201d\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Hoskinson and the Ethereum community have been at loggerheads, which all stemmed from Hoskinson\u2019s removal from the Ethereum cycle years ago."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSharding' splits a blockchain into smaller 'shards' to address the issue of scalability associated with Layer 1 networks.\n\nSharding improves transaction speeds, minimizes processing and storage costs, and enhances network performance.\n\nSharding comes with its potential drawbacks, such as network security concerns and complexity of cross-shard transactions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlockchain technology has introduced unprecedented potential in decentralization, transparency, and security. But it faces a significant challenge: scalability. Scalability is one point of the \"blockchain trilemma,\" which also includes security and decentralization. Achieving all three simultaneously is a persisting issue in the blockchain realm. This is where strategic solutions like \"sharding\" come into play.\n\nWhat Is Sharding?\n\nSharding is a concept borrowed from traditional database management. It refers to the process of splitting a larger database into smaller, more manageable parts, called shards. Its application in blockchain aims to improve scalability, whilst maintaining the principle of decentralization. In essence, sharding occurs when a blockchain network is divided into smaller parts known as shards, each capable of parallelly processing transactions and smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Sharding Work?\n\nUnderstanding how sharding is executed within a blockchain network requires a comprehension of how blockchain data is usually stored and processed. There are various ways data can be processed. We are going to look into sequential and parallel processing.\n\nTypically, each blockchain node is responsible for handling all of the transaction volume within the network. This type of data processing is commonly referred to as sequential processing. This implies that every node must maintain and store all critical information, such as account balances and transaction history. In essence, each node must process all network operations, data, and transactions.\n\nThough such a model bolsters the security of the blockchain by recording every transaction across all nodes, it dramatically slows down the processing of data. This is where parallel processing of data comes into play as it allows for multiple operations to be executed concurrently.\n\nSharding can be a potent solution to this predicament as it divides or 'partitions' the transactional workload across the blockchain network. This means that not all nodes need to manage or process the entirety of the blockchain's load.\n\nInstead, sharding segregates the workload through horizontal partitioning. In this process, the data is divided into horizontal subsets, with each shard acting as an independent database capable of processing transactions separately from the others.\n\nHorizontal vs. vertical partitioning\n\nHorizontal partitioning and vertical partitioning are two key approaches to database scaling. While both are designed to manage large data sets more effectively, they work in fundamentally different ways. Sharding is a common method of implementing horizontal partitioning.\n\nIn horizontal partitioning, the data is divided into rows and spread across different nodes (or databases), each containing a subset of the data. Each row in a table is a unique entity, so separating them doesn't lead to any loss of data integrity. A prominent example of horizontal partitioning in use is in the distribution of blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn vertical partitioning, the data is divided into columns, rather than rows. Each partition in vertical partitioning contains a subset of data for each entity, or the entire dataset, but only for a certain set of attributes. For instance, consider a customer table with columns like Name, Status, Description, and Photo. In a vertical partitioning scenario, the 'Name' and 'Status' might be kept in one table, and 'Description' and 'Photo' in another.\n\nWhy is horizontal partitioning preferred?\n\nHorizontal partitioning is generally favored over vertical partitioning in blockchain networks for three key reasons: scalability, decentralization, and security.\n\nScalability: Sharding provides a solution by breaking the data into smaller, more manageable 'shards'. Each shard can operate independently, enabling more transactions to be processed simultaneously, improving network speed and efficiency. Whereas with vertical partitioning, distributing the columns across different databases might require more complexity in retrieving a complete transaction or block information and could limit the scalability.\n\nDecentralization: In keeping with the core ethos of blockchain, horizontal partitioning supports decentralization. When nodes only have to process a portion of the total data (a shard), it allows for more nodes to participate in the network since the computational and storage burdens are reduced. Vertical partitioning, comparatively, would restrict this as each node would need access to all partitions (all columns of data) to understand and verify the complete block data.\n\nSecurity and Data Integrity: Horizontal partitioning maintains data integrity because each shard (or partition) contains complete transaction data, ensuring that each node has a full, accurate copy of its portion of the blockchain. In vertical partitioning, you'd essentially be splitting up a block's data across different nodes, making it challenging to ensure data integrity and security, a paramount aspect of blockchain networks.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Sharding?\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the potential benefits that sharding brings to blockchain technology:\n\nIncreased Transaction Speed: Sharding facilitates parallel processing of transactions. Instead of processing transactions one by one in a sequential manner, sharding allows transactions to be processed simultaneously but on different shards. Each shard works independently, thereby increasing transaction speed significantly. This not only expedites transaction speed, but it also means that the whole network can handle more users, promoting mass adoption.\n\nAn example of an existing blockchain network using shards to address scalability is Ziliqa. Ziliqa\u2019s sharding mechanism allows it to achieve thousands of transactions per second.\n\nMinimized Processing and Storage Costs: The conventional blockchain design obliges every node to store all transactions, intensifying the demands on hardware as the blockchain grows. But with sharding, each node is responsible for processing and storing just a fraction of the entire network's data\u2014this decreases the resources necessary for a node to participate in the network.\n\nAs such, more participants can join as validators, enhancing network decentralization without incurring prohibitive costs. It mitigates problems where only entities with high-end, expensive computing resources could realistically participate in the process, thus maintaining the democratized nature of blockchain networks.\n\nImproved Network Performance: Sharding can help to improve overall network performance and capacity. In the traditional blockchains, as more nodes participate in the network, the performance paradoxically decreases due to the need for increased data communication and synchronization between nodes.\n\nHowever, sharding transforms this scenario. Since each shard works separately and concurrently, the system can process more transactions and computations. When a new node joins, it can be added to a shard instead of the entire network, thus enhancing the network's capacity to scale. Efficiency is improved, leading to smoother transactions and a better user experience.\n\nRemember, future advancements and improvements in sharding technology may create other advantages, or strengthen these existing ones, enhancing the blockchain ecosystem continually.\n\nWhat Are the Limitations of Sharding?\n\nWhile sharding offers several potential benefits that could help blockchain networks become more efficient, the process also introduces a unique set of challenges. Some potential vulnerabilities introduced by sharding include:\n\nSingle Shard Takeover Attacks: In a sharding environment, the computational power to take over a single shard is dramatically less than the power required to take over the entire network. This makes these individual shards more vulnerable to a \"one-percent attack\" or \"shard takeover\" - whereby an attacker with a small amount of resources compared to the whole network can potentially take over an individual shard.\n\nCross-shard Transactions: Transactions happening across different shards (cross-shard) present a unique challenge. Cross-shard transactions are complex and could potentially lead to double-spending if not carefully managed. If one shard doesn't accurately track the state of the other shard during a transaction, users may exploit this to \"double spend\".\n\nData Availability Problems: Sharding makes maintaining the entire network state an intricate effort. If certain shards aren\u2019t available when required (because the nodes maintaining those shards are offline), it could lead to data availability issues, disrupting the entire network.\n\nNetwork Security: Sharding requires the implementation of a robust protocol that balances the load between shards. If not correctly done, this could lead to uneven distribution of data or imbalance of resources, resulting in potential network instability.\n\nNode Synchronization: Node synchronization can cause network delays due to the time it takes to share and update information across different nodes. Furthermore, if a node with slower processing capabilities or network connection lags behind, it could slow down the entire synchronization process, reducing the overall performance of the blockchain network.\n\nIs Sharding Implemented on Ethereum?\n\nEthereum has plans to implement sharding as part of their Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity, is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that aims to enhance the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the network, allowing it to process more transactions and ease congestion.\n\nAs of now, the upgrade is being implemented in phases, with the final phase (Phase 2) including the full implementation of sharding. Ethereum developers hope that these enhancements will address some of the current challenges associated with scalability and transaction cost that the network is facing.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that implementing sharding comes with its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining the security and decentralization of the network. Therefore, Ethereum developers are putting careful thought and extensive testing into this transition to ensure the upgrade's success when fully implemented.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nOverall, sharding represents a noteworthy advance towards solving the blockchain trilemma. While it introduces new complexities and possible drawbacks, its potential for increasing scalability without compromising decentralization holds immense promise for the future of blockchain networks.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that various blockchains are exploring sharding as a potential solution. Ethereum is integrating sharding as part of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to address scalability issues. This implementation is expected to take place through The Cancun upgrade, a critical component of the overall enhancement plan. Nevertheless, like any other evolving technology, success will depend on ongoing research, development, and rigorous testing of sharding implementations.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) his disapproval of the popular description of the Solana network as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d In his words, he doesn\u2019t \u201csee a future where Solana thrives and somehow ETH dies.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t bring back last cycle \u201ceth killer\u201d bs. It\u2019s lame. Pareto efficient technologies can have overlapping features and will compete, but that\u2019s all ok. I don\u2019t see a future where solana thrives and somehow eth dies. I am such a techno optimist that I am certain that\u2026 \u2014 toly ???????? (@aeyakovenko) December 2, 2023\n\nSolana Lauded as an ETH Killer\n\nThe layer-1 Solana network was created to offer smart contract capabilities like the Ethereum network. However, it supersedes the Ethereum mainnet regarding speed and energy efficiency thanks to its use of a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum blockchain implemented the energy-consuming proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The network also processed only about 30 transactions per second, compared to Solana\u2019s record of 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nDue to its inherent features, the Solana network has been lauded as an ETH killer since its official launch in 2020. The term has also been used to describe some popular blockchains such as Cardano, Tezos, Avalanche, and Polygon.\n\nSolana has also introduced toolsets to onboard developers from the Ethereum network into its ecosystem. In July, Solana Labs launched Solang, a compiler enabling developers familiar with Ethereum\u2019s programming language (Solidity) to write smart contracts on the Solana mainnet.\n\nDescribing the expression as \u201clame,\u201d Yakovenko argued that even though Solana and Ethereum have similarities, the latter will not be overshadowed by the initial.\n\nSolana Ranks Among Best Performing Cryptocurrencies\n\nAmong the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s SOL emerged as the best performer. Maintaining its ranking as the sixth-largest crypto by market capitalization, SOL has soared by over 220% in the last three months alone. These metrics supersede crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).\n\nGoing from as low as $17.9 to as high as $65.2, market experts suggest that the cryptocurrency will likely surpass the $70 price mark as active addresses increase. Presently, SOL trades at $63.8, representing 2.7% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSource: CoinStats"
