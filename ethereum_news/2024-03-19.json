        "title": "SEC probing crypto companies in Ethereum investigation as hopes for ETF dim - Fortune",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is waging an energetic legal campaign to classify Ethereum, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, as a security, according to U.S. companies that have received subpoenas related to an investigation. The news delivers a further blow to the crypto industry\u2019s hopes the agency will approve applications by BlackRock and others for an Ethereum ETF following the SEC\u2019s approval of a series of Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Ethereum investigation involves demanding companies furnish any documents and financial records they may have regarding their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation, a nonprofit group that oversees the governance and development of the blockchain by the same name.\n\nAccording to a person at a company who received a recent subpoena request, the SEC\u2019s probe of the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation began shortly after the blockchain\u2019s shift to a new governance model known as \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d in September 2022. Another person at a separate company that received a subpoena described it as narrow and focused on the Ethereum Foundation, and said they received the subpoena in the last few weeks.\n\nThat proof-of-stake event moved the blockchain away from the energy-intensive model used by Bitcoin in favor of one that relies on a trusted network of validators\u2014and provided the SEC with a new pretext to attempt to define Ethereum as a security, according to people at three different companies familiar with the subpoenas. The people asked Fortune not to identify identify them or their firms for fear of retaliation by the agency\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler, whom one described as \u201cvindictive.\u201d\n\nThe existence of an investigation into the Ethereum Foundation was reported on Wednesday by CoinDesk, which cited an update to the group\u2019s Github code repository that reportedly provided evidence of a probe by an unknown state agency.\n\n\u201cThe SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation,\u201d the agency said in response to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nA push to label Ethereum a security\n\nThe news of the subpoenas comes as the SEC and the Biden administration pursue an aggressive campaign to cut down the crypto industry, which they characterize as lawless. This campaign, however, has been frustrated at times by the vague legal status of cryptocurrencies, which has led to a series of court battles over whether the SEC even has jurisdiction over the industry.\n\nThis critical question of jurisdiction turns on whether a given cryptocurrency is a security, an issue that has not definitively been addressed by courts. While there is a consensus Bitcoin is instead a commodity, under the supervision of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, Gensler has signaled his agency regards the vast majority of other cryptocurrencies as securities that must be registered with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC has made this case in recent court cases, except when it comes to Ethereum, whose legal status is even murkier. The security status of Ether has long been a point of contention for the agency. Speaking at a conference in 2018, then-Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman said that Ether did not resemble a security. Emails published as part of the Ripple trial revealed that SEC staff deliberated on how clear to make the assertion and that one official wanted to say that the agency did \u201cnot\u2026see a need to regulate Ether.\u201d\n\nThat changed under Gensler, who took over the agency in 2021, and following Ethereum\u2019s switch to proof-of-stake the following year.\n\nAt that time, Gensler said that any crypto assets produced by blockchains that use a proof-of-stake model could resemble investment contracts and therefore be classified as securities, although he was not speaking about any specific coin. In March 2023, he once again suggested that proof-of-stake tokens could be regulated as securities, although he\u2019s since declined to comment specifically on Ethereum, including at SEC oversight hearings at the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe issue grew more complicated in October after the SEC approved nine ETFs that tracked the Ether futures market, which is overseen by the CFTC, suggesting the view Ether is a commodity. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has said on several occasions that his agency views Ether as a commodity.\n\nBut last month, the controversial crypto firm Prometheum, which has the approval to operate as a special purpose broker-dealer, announced its intention to offer custody services for Ethereum as a security under SEC oversight, once again adding uncertainty to Ether\u2019s regulatory status. One of the recipients of the recent subpoena speculated that Gensler has sought to use Prometheum as a Trojan Horse to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nThe recent race by major financial firms including Fidelity and BlackRock to gain approval for a spot Ether ETF has brought the issue into the spotlight, with all signs pointing to the SEC rejecting the applications by their May deadline. Bloomberg analysts have pointed out that agency staff have not gone back and forth with issuers on details about the potential, as they did with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved in January.\n\nA potential declaration that Ether is a security could throw the process into further doubt, especially as it would raise questions over the CFTC\u2019s supervision of Ether futures markets."

        "title": "SEC Investigating Ethereum Foundation Regarding Proof-of-Stake Transition: Report - Unchained",
        "content": "Fortune reported on Wednesday that the SEC may have had its sights on the Ethereum Foundation since as early as 2022, while CoinDesk wrote that the Foundation faces an inquiry from an unnamed government agency.\n\nThe SEC may be looking into whether Ethereum's switch to a proof-of-stake model makes it more of a security, according to Fortune.\n\nTwo reports on Wednesday have ignited conversations about the potential investigation of the Ethereum Foundation by regulatory authorities, notably the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe first report, published by Coindesk, highlighted the removal of certain confidentiality language from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website in February 2024. The language, which is usually included to subtly indicate that a project had not received requests for information from any authorities, read:\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not to be disclosed. Stiftung Ethereum will publicly disclose any sort of inquiry from government agencies that falls outside the scope of regular business operations.\u201d\n\nThis language was removed in February, though news of its removal only began to circulate on Wednesday.\n\nSoon after, a second, more explosive report published by Fortune suggested the SEC had begun investigating the Ethereum Foundation shortly after Ethereum migrated to its current proof-of-stake model. This model, which rewards users for staking tokens and allows for participation in governance votes based on token holdings, may resemble traditional securities to the extent that the regulator may attempt to regulate it as such.\n\nFortune\u2019s report revealed that the SEC began probing the Ethereum Foundation shortly after its blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake. This information, sourced from individuals at companies who received subpoenas, suggests a focused interest from the SEC on how Ethereum\u2019s new governance model could influence its classification, possibly as a security. These individuals, who requested anonymity due to concerns over retaliation, hinted at an energetic approach from the SEC to redefine Ethereum\u2019s legal status.\n\nThe price of ether, Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, fell almost 6% following the publication of the two reports on Wednesday late morning ET, but it has since recovered, according to CoinGecko. Ether was recently trading at $3,387, up 1.5% over the last hour.\n\nCommunity Responses\n\nThe latest developments have sparked widespread speculation within the crypto community, although opinions vary on their significance. Some community members and observers have downplayed the potential impact of these investigations, suggesting that regulatory scrutiny of major cryptocurrency foundations is not uncommon.\n\nAmong those downplaying the seriousness of the news was Neeraj K. Agrawal, Communications Director for cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center, who questioned on X the substance of Fortune\u2019s report and suggested that the crypto industry is overreacting. Meanwhile, others view the SEC\u2019s actions as a continuation of its aggressive posture towards the crypto industry, potentially impacting the approval odds for spot Ethereum ETF applications, which analysts have recently been reducing.\n\nRead More: Bloomberg ETF Analysts Now Predict SEC Will Reject Spot Ether ETFs in May\n\nIs Ethereum a Security?\n\nAt the heart of the apparent investigation lies the complex legal status of Ethereum as either a commodity or a security. The SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, has remained ambiguous on Ethereum\u2019s status in spite of a willingness to declare other tokens securities in a variety of legal actions. Still others point to Gensler\u2019s own shifting position in this regard, frequently highlighting his apparently contradictory statements regarding ETH\u2019s status as a security during his time as a professor at MIT.\n\nToday\u2019s reporting suggests that may have changed in September 2022, when Ethereum successfully completed its transition to a proof-of-stake model. This move was part of Ethereum\u2019s broader strategy to enhance efficiency and reduce its environmental footprint. However, it also introduced new complications on the regulatory front. Gensler has argued since then that U.S. securities laws are much more applicable to proof-of-stake blockchains since they allow holders to participate in governance votes and earn yield from their staked tokens.\n\nThe apparent investigation also comes at a critical time when major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have applied to launch Ethereum ETFs. The SEC\u2019s actions have dampened hopes for the approval of these ETFs, with Bloomberg analysts predicting a rejection of spot Ether ETFs in May. This skepticism stems from the lack of engagement between the SEC and ETF issuers, a stark contrast to the flurry of dialogue observed prior to spot Bitcoin ETFs being approved.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the crypto community remains watchful of the SEC\u2019s actions and their potential impacts on Ethereum\u2019s future developments and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem."

The specifics of the inquiry and the identity of the authority have not been disclosed.\n\nAn SEC investigation into ETH\u2019s classification leading to ETH being deemed a security could have consequences for Ethereum, ETH ETF applications, and the cryptocurrency market at large, according to the report.\n\nThe specific reasons for the inquiry remain unknown, but it is possible that a Swiss regulator may have issued a document request to the Ethereum Foundation, possibly in collaboration with the SEC, the report said, citing its interview with an unnamed attorney. The timing of the inquiry could be related to the SEC\u2019s upcoming deadline on May 23, indicating increased activity and investigations by regulatory authorities.\n\nThe SEC approved bitcoin as an ETF in January after years of opposition to the idea of an ETF that invests in bitcoin. While that approval was heralded by figures throughout the cryptocurrency industry, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stressed that the approval applies only to bitcoin and should not be seen as an indication that the regulator is ready to approve other listed securities.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

The same lawyer also extended the speculation by saying that the request in question may also point to a collaboration between the named entity (ostensibly, the Swiss government, in this case) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s fair to say the Ethereum Foundation is not the only entity that they are seeking information from,\u201d the lawyer said, implying that other overseas entities might have received a similar method of scrutiny based on documentary requests.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time of significant technological changes for Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. Following its initial coin offering in 2015, Ethereum recently implemented the Dencun upgrade, designed to reduce transaction costs for users of Ethereum-based layer-2 platforms.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the SEC is also currently evaluating multiple applications for an Ether ETF, with a final deadline for some applications approaching on May 23. However, analysts following the process have expressed skepticism about the likelihood of approval, citing a lack of engagement between applicants and SEC officials.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not to be disclosed. Stiftung Ethereum will publicly disclose any sort of inquiry from government agencies that falls outside the scope of regular business operations,\u201d says a disclosure on the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s website.\n\nThis statement is a warrant canary, and it has since been removed from the website, coinciding with the aforementioned GitHub commit.\n\nBy definition, a warrant canary is a form of text or visual warning that companies include on their websites to indicate they have never been served with a secret government subpoena or document request. The removal of the canary suggests that the Ethereum Foundation may have received such a request without explicitly stating so.\n\nThe SEC recently requested for public comment on proof of stake, the consensus algorithm employed by Ethereum and other blockchains.\n\nUPDATE: According to a report from Fortune, the SEC is pursuing an \u201cenergetic legal campaign\u201d to classify Ethereum as a security, confirming the investigation\u2019s links to the US government."

        "content": "What Happened in Crypto Today: Are Ethereum ETFs in Trouble? Analysts Are Losing Faith\n\nThis week in crypto felt like we all got roped into a real-life Squid Game. The high-stakes challenges just kept coming at the community from every angle.\n\nIt started off with Bitcoin hitting a fresh new all-time high of around $73,000 last Thursday. The community was euphoric, dreaming of life-changing riches as the OG coin blasted through resistance like it was nothing.\n\nSource: BTC price page\n\nBut then, brutal reality struck. BTC retraced all the way back down to $63,000 as an aggressive sell-off neutralized the epic rally in a heartbeat.\n\nAs the market was trying to process the price chaos, a major drama erupted on another front. Trezor - one of the most trusted names in the crypto security game - got its social media account compromised. Their X account was used to shill a fake \"TRZR\" token sale in what felt like a cruelly personalized variation of the Red Light/Green Light game.\n\nAnd just when we thought things couldn\u2019t get worse, the SEC made a move (well, not really!). Those awaiting rulings on the proposed ETH ETF applications got slammed as the SEC elected to kick those all-important decisions down the road yet again with delays.\n\nIn the midst of this password-pocalypse, the crypto news cycle kept on spinning with more major players making power moves. So let\u2019s round up the top crypto stories!\n\nHere's a TLDR of the top headlines:\n\nLet\u2019s get into the details of each of these stories!\n\nWe Hope You Didn\u2019t Fall for TRZR\u2026\n\nYesterday, things went south in the world of wallets - and it all started with one of the most trusted names in the hardware wallet game.\n\nOn March 19th, none other than Trezor, the cryptocurrency hardware wallet firm that's sold over 2 million devices worldwide, fell victim to a major security breach. And trust us, it wasn't pretty.\n\nAccording to reports, Trezor's official account on the bird app was hacked in what's suspected to be a SIM-swap attack. And once the attackers had control, they wasted no time in pushing an elaborate crypto scam.\n\nThe compromised account started promoting a fake token presale for \"TRZR\" token on the Solana blockchain.\n\nHow much money did its followers lose? Did Trezor make any official announcement following the incident? Read the full story!\n\nAnother Big Move by BlackRock\n\nThe world's largest asset manager has just filed with the SEC to launch a tokenized asset fund. And we're not talking about some small-time operation here \u2013 this is a big move from one of the most influential players in the finance game.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the filing, BlackRock's new fund will be called the \"BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund,\" and it'll be registered in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBut here is the problem - if you want to get in on the action, you better have some serious cash to throw around because the minimum investment is $100,000.\n\nOn the bright side, if approved, we will probably see trillions pouring into tokenization and RWAs soon! Read the full story!\n\n$100M Web3 Gaming Fund?\n\nAnother day, another blockchain gaming investment fund, right? \ud83e\udd71\n\nThis time it's Immutable, Polygon Labs, and VC firm King River Capital teaming up to launch a $100 million \"Inevitable Games Fund.\" Sounds impressive on paper, but what's in it for the average crypto degen?\n\nThey've already secured backing from big names like Abu Dhabi's Alpha Wave Ventures and Mike Arrington's family office. Moreover, the fund has its hands in a few buzzy gaming projects like Pixelmon and Guild of Guardians.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's just another VC money pit...unless there's something truly game-changing in store.\n\nMaybe this trio has cracked the code on delivering an actual fun and worthwhile Web3 gaming experience? One that doesn't feel like a cash grab or tech demo, but an innovative blend of gaming and crypto that hasn't been seen before? Read the full story!\n\nMatter Labs Makes Moves\n\nIt's time to talk about a power move in the world of layer-2 scaling solutions and institutional finance.\n\nMatter Labs has teamed up with the digital asset bigwigs over at Sygnum Bank to tokenize $50 million of their treasury reserves. That's right \u2013 Fifty. Million. Dollars.\n\nBut wait, there's more! This tokenization extravaganza isn't just some random crypto flexing. Nope, these funds are being tokenized onto the very blockchain that Matter Labs built \u2013 zkSync itself.\n\nNow, for those of you who aren't familiar with the world of traditional finance (or \"Trad-Fi,\" as we like to call it), these tokenized funds will represent Matter Labs' investment into the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund. And we're not just talking about some fly-by-night operation here \u2013 this Fidelity fund is an open-ended money market behemoth.\n\nFeels like RWA and tokenization are in line to be the next big trend to follow. Read the full story!\n\nSEC and ETH ETFs\n\nThe SEC has decided to keep us all in suspense a little while longer by delaying its ruling on the proposed spot ETH ETFs from Hashdex and ARK 21Shares.\n\nAccording to the SEC's announcement on March 19th, the final decision on these ETH ETF applications has been pushed back to late May, leaving the crypto community on the edge of their seats for at least another couple of months.\n\nIt seems that the market analysts over at Bloomberg are starting to lose faith in the prospect of these ETFs getting the green light. Yep, you read that right \u2013 even the seasoned experts are starting to doubt the SEC's willingness to play ball.\n\nWeren\u2019t Bloomberg analysts too optimistic about ETH ETF approval in May? What happened? What did they say? Read the full story!\n\nPopular Game Developer Goes Web3\n\nThe masterminds behind iconic franchises like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts are diving headfirst into blockchain gaming. And they're not just dipping their toes in the water \u2013 Square Enix has formed a partnership with HyperPlay, a Web3 games platform built on blockchain.\n\nThis collaboration isn't just a handshake deal \u2013 Square Enix made an undisclosed investment in HyperPlay, with the goal of expanding and scaling the platform's game store offerings.\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, Square Enix is also set to launch \"SYMBIOGENESIS,\" an art experience based on the popular cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask, on the HyperPlay storefront. Read the full story!\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap! See you tomorrow with more crypto stories."

And Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer said that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201dWall Street, traditional finance just started ingesting this giant thing called Bitcoin,\u201d Matt Hougan, CIO at the asset manager, said on a panel Tuesday at the Digital Asset Summit in London. \u201cWe need another eight or nine months of digesting Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHougan said on X after the event that his comments are controversial as hype for an Ethereum ETF lingers.\n\nVanEck is the first Ethereum ETF application on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s pile. The regulator is due to decide the outcome of the application on May 23.\n\nHougan\u2019s surprising take comes as market participants look to Ethereum after Bitcoin became the fastest-growing ETF sector since the SEC approved them in January.\n\nWith $65 billion in trading volumes this month, Bitcoin\u2019s inflows have shattered expectations, bringing in $12 billion.\n\nBut hopes for its Ethereum counterpart are dwindling: Bloomberg Intelligence analysts this month lowered their odds of a May approval to just 35%.\n\n\u2018Good for the industry\u2019\n\nIf the SEC does push back that deadline to December \u201cthat will be a net good for the crypto industry and ultimately, for ETH ETF flows,\u201d Hougan said at the event.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December vs. if they launch in May,\u201d he added on X.\n\n\u201cI tend to agree,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart wrote in an X repost of Hougan.\n\nSeyffart reiterated his bearishness for a May 23 nod: \u201cThe SEC hasn\u2019t engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics,\u201d unlike its approach to its Bitcoin ETF counterparts.\n\nBitwise doesn\u2019t have an active spot Ethereum ETF filing before the SEC.\n\nDifferent this time\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, said on X that one key difference between the Ethereum and Bitcoin applications is that the SEC doesn\u2019t face the legal pressure it did with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn August, a court victory by Grayscale against the agency \u201cbasically forced it\u201d to approve the ETFs, Chervinsky wrote.\n\nAdding to the pressure: A letter drafted last week by two US senators urged the SEC not to approve any other crypto-based exchange-traded products.\n\nThe letter shows \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said.\n\nHe added that that pressure is now part of why he and his colleagues are pessimistic that Ether ETFs will be approved.\n\nPossible BlackRock withdrawal\n\nChervinsky earlier this month cited \u201cpolitical blowback\u201d suffered by the SEC surrounding spot Bitcoin ETF approvals as a sign the agency may ask BlackRock and other Ether ETF applicants to withdraw their applications.\n\nBlackRock and the SEC have a \u201ccollaborative relationship,\u201d so BlackRock may withdraw its Ethereum application, Chervinsky said.\n\n\u201cI bet they will,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an email to DL News, BlackRock declined to comment on its active filings with the SEC.\n\nTyler Pearson is a markets correspondent at DL News based out of Alberta, Canada.

        "content": "BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, has created a new tokenized asset fund, according to a March 19 SEC filing.\n\nThe initiative \u2014 dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund \u2014 is registered in the British Virgin Islands and developed in partnership with San Francisco-based Securitize, a company focused on asset tokenization.\n\nThe technical details of the fund and which asset classes it aims to tokenize were not disclosed in the filing and remain unclear. On-chain data shows the fund has been seeded with an initial capital of $100 million USDC on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe companies have yet to make a public announcement and did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.\n\nRWAs\n\nThe establishment of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund is reflective of the increasing interest in the tokenization of real-world assets. This emerging sector aims to combine the capabilities of digital assets with traditional finance to streamline the settlement process and enhance transactional efficiency via blockchain technology.\n\nThe market responded positively to the announcement of the fund, with a notable increase in the value of ONDO, the native token of Ondo Finance, a platform that facilitates the tokenization of real-world assets.\n\nThe token was trading at $0.5 as of press time, up 12% over the past 24 hours despite the wider market crash, according to CryptoSlate data.\n\nWith this new venture, BlackRock has positioned itself at the forefront of integrating digital assets with traditional financial services, potentially setting a trend for more institutional investments in blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s crypto journey\n\nThe Digital Liquidity Fund is the latest step in BlackRock\u2019s broader journey in the digital assets industry, following the introduction of its spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 IBIT \u2014 in January. The ETF has seen record-setting performance since its launch and rapidly attracted over $15 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe firm also has an Ethereum ETF application in the pipeline and is considered to be bullish on both crypto and the underlying blockchain technology that allows tokenization.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently highlighted the strategic importance of BTC and ETH ETFs as precursors to wider adoption of tokenization in the financial industry. He said these products would open the door to a significant shift towards incorporating digital assets into conventional financial practices.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Grayscale Investments plans to add staking to its proposed spot Ethereum ETF, following a similar move from Fidelity Investments earlier this week.\n\nGrayscale Investments says that having the ability to stake ether would allow the fund to mitigate inflationary pressures and preserve value for shareholders.\n\nGrayscale Investments has included a provision to stake ether in its application for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn a preliminary proxy statement filed on Tuesday, Grayscale put forth four proposals in a consent solicitation statement for its proposed Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) \u2014 a close-ended ether fund that it intends to convert into an ETF if approved.\n\nOne of the four proposed items included the ability for the fund to stake ether through the trust in a Proof-of-Stake validation protocol.\n\n\u201cWe hope you share our view that these amendments both modernize and simplify ETHE Shares for the ultimate benefit of current and future ETHE shareholders,\u201d wrote Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein.\n\nThe provision follows a similar one filed by Fidelity Investments in its application for a spot ether ETF, which the firm amended on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook for a spot ether ETF being approved has started to look less promising, with Bloomberg ETF analysts now predicting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely reject all applications in the pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen signs of SEC engagement with the issuers on this topic and we would have expected to see more substantial signs of interactions between the SEC and these issuers by now if the SEC were planning to approve,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in an email to Unchained.\n\nThe overwhelming demand for spot bitcoin ETFs following their approval aided bitcoin\u2019s push towards a new all-time high, and it is fair to assume that the price of ether might follow a similar trajectory if spot ether ETFs were to be approved. However, the SEC\u2019s stance on the status of ether as an asset is markedly different from its view on bitcoin.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has stated on a number of occasions that bitcoin is the only digital asset that can be considered a commodity, and \u201ceverything other than bitcoin\u201d could be classified as a security.\n\nIn April, Gensler avoided giving a direct response to a question from House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry on whether Ethereum was a security or a commodity."

        "content": "The US SEC has delayed the approval process for several highly anticipated Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), recent regulatory filings show.\n\nThe delays affect proposals from investment firms, including VanEck, Ark Invest, Hashdex, and Grayscale \u2014 which has added a staking component to its ETH ETF application along with Fidelity \u2014 sparking discussions about the future of crypto ETFs in the US.\n\nLower odds of approval\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who has been closely monitoring the developments, expressed a shift from his previously cautiously optimistic outlook regarding the approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nHe noted that the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement on Ethereum-specific issues contrasts sharply with their approach to Bitcoin ETFs in the previous fall, dampening hopes for a positive outcome by the crucial May 23 deadline.\n\nSimilarly, Eric Balchunas recently pointed out that the absence of bullish signs and sources that were present before the Bitcoin ETF approvals significantly reduces the chances of a favorable decision for Ethereum ETFs, estimating the odds at 35%.\n\nThe conversation extended beyond the ETF delays, touching upon the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Some suggested the SEC might insist on a court order before approving Ethereum ETFs, citing potential differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of their designation.\n\nHowever, Seyffart disagreed with the notion that Ethereum could be classified as a security, a designation that could fundamentally impact its regulatory treatment.\n\nThe discussion also ventured into the realm of potential outcomes and strategies. Seyffart speculated about the future of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum futures product and its implications for potential legal challenges against the SEC\u2019s decisions.\n\nStaking in ETFs\n\nMeanwhile, both Fidelity and Grayscale have added amendments to their Ethereum ETF applications to include a staking component.\n\nStaking, a fundamental aspect of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) model, involves the locking up of digital assets to support the network\u2019s security and functionality, offering participants rewards in the form of additional crypto.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s proposal, like Fidelity\u2019s, allows the ETF to allocate part of its holdings to staking through selected providers, potentially including affiliates. The move is designed to explore the income generation possibilities within a regulated financial framework, with the ETF expected to receive ether tokens as network rewards, which could be considered income for the fund.\n\nHowever, this addition arrives amid increased scrutiny from US lawmakers, who have recently urged the SEC to halt the approval of new crypto-related ETFs due to concerns over investor risks.\n\nAs the May 23 deadline approaches, the crypto community remains on edge, awaiting further developments.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 2:25 am UTC on Mar. 20, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is down 6.6% over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > SEC investigating Ethereum Foundation in bid to declare ETH a security\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nCracks are appearing in the Ethereum Foundation following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing the group ahead of plans to label the ETH token an unregistered security.\n\nOn March 20, sharp-eyed observers noticed a small but significant change in the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s GitHub repository that was made on February 26. Gone from the site was a block of text declaring that the Foundation \u201chas never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not be disclosed.\u201d\n\nThe change was made by developer Pablo Pettinari, whose description of the revision stated that the change was necessary due to the Foundation having \u201creceived a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.\u201d A \u2018warrant canary\u2019 was also quietly removed from the Foundation site, indicating that it had been served with a subpoena or other secret government request.\n\nFortune subsequently reported that the SEC had served subpoenas on multiple companies seeking financial records and other documentation regarding their dealings with the Foundation. One of these companies told Fortune that the SEC had launched a probe into the Foundation following the Ethereum network\u2019s September 2022 transition\n\nfrom a consensus mechanism based on proof-of-work (PoW) to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nPoS requires Ethereum transaction validators to post a \u2018stake\u2019 of 32 ETH tokens, a sum worth around US$51,000 at the time (currently worth over US$100,000), making it a prohibitive barrier for most ETH holders to clear. The net result of this shift was that a handful of ETH whales\u2014including many Foundation insiders who claimed large portions of the ETH distributed via the network\u2019s controversial pre-mine\u2014are now reaping most of the rewards for keeping the network humming.\n\nFortune claimed that individuals at three companies that received SEC subpoenas said that the shift to PoS had offered the agency \u2018a new pretext\u2019 to define ETH as a security. This isn\u2019t much of a revelation: SEC Chairman Gary Gensler commented at the time that entities offering PoS-based \u2018staking services\u2019 represented \u201canother indicia that under the Howey test, the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others.\u201d\n\nGensler wasn\u2019t alone in making this observation. In March 2023, the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office filed charges against the KuCoin exchange for failing to register as a securities broker-dealer. The NYAG called the complaint \u201cone of the first times a regulator is claiming in court that ETH, one of the largest cryptocurrencies available, is a security.\u201d\n\nThe NYAG explained that \u201cETH\u2019s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH \u2026 [Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin] and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives on the Ethereum blockchain that impact the functionality and price of ETH.\u201d\n\nPrior to the network\u2019s launch, Buterin himself stated publicly that \u201cif you\u2019re investing in Ethereum, I would say you\u2019re investing in the team and community.\u201d More recently, former Ethereum insider Steven Nerayoff offered evidence showing that Ethereum Foundation members understood from the start that ETH was a security.\n\nNerayoff released emails showing Ethereum Co-Founder Joseph Lubin asking lawyers for a legal opinion that would leave insiders \u201cwell insulated from criminal liability regarding securities laws.\u201d This acknowledgment of ETH\u2019s security status helps explain why Lubin and other insiders did such a full-court press on Gensler\u2019s predecessor, William Hinman, who in June 2018 controversially declared that ETH was originally a security but then \u201cbecome something other than a security.\u201d\n\n(g)ETF(*cked)\n\nThe SEC has yet to comment publicly on the Fortune report other than to say it doesn\u2019t comment on possible investigations, whether they exist or not. The ETH token suffered a momentary plunge as the story broke, but has since recovered its losses and then some.\n\nRegardless, the Ethereum community is up in arms over the mounting suspicion that the SEC wants to label ETH a security in order to justify the SEC\u2019s refusal to authorize new ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Rightly or wrongly, the launch of multiple BTC-based ETFs in January has been credited with that token\u2019s otherwise unwarranted spike in fiat value, and ETH holders want to artificially pump their own bags in the same fashion.\n\nFoundation members decided they wanted in on the ETF spoils once they learned that their developer counterparts at BTC Core had been promised a share of the profits\u2014anywhere from 5-10% for a decade\u2014by at least two of the BTC ETF issuers.\n\nSo far, the SEC has refused to play ball, using all the procedural options at their disposal to avoid having to issue a formal decision on any of the multiple ETH ETF applications. Just this week, the SEC told an ETF applicant to cool their heels while asking the public to submit further comments.\n\nThe SEC has until May 23 to issue a decision one way or the other, but the reported lack of communication between the SEC and applicants regarding the finer points of their paperwork has been taken as a sign that ETH won\u2019t be getting the BTC treatment.\n\nLabeling ETH a security could set up a regulatory turf war between the SEC and the\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which currently regulates ETH-based futures contracts. One year ago, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam told Congress that \u201cwe would not have allowed the Ether futures product to be listed on a CFTC exchange if we did not feel strongly that it was a commodity asset.\u201d\n\nThis interagency slap-fight could provoke Congress to finally set some firm boundaries between the two regulators when it comes to digital assets. But given the current Congress appears infinitely more interested in performative stunts than actually legislating, don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone focuses on the ETF question, there is also the possibility that Gensler will use whatever information he may have gleaned via the SEC\u2019s subpoenas to file a complaint against the Ethereum Foundation, Buterin, Lubin and countless others connected with that centralized mothership.\n\nIt\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t plenty of options\u2014in terms of both the number of targets and the type of charges\u2014to choose from.\n\nWatch: Digital currency regulation and the role of BSV blockchain"

The upgrade is expected to make transaction fees on the blockchain much cheaper. Standard Chartered's prediction is in line with other bullish forecasts for Ethereum. In January, JPMorgan predicted that ETH could reach $5,000 by the end of the year.\n\nSeveral high-profile fund managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Ethereum ETFs. Standard Chartered expects the SEC to approve the ETFs by the summer."

        "content": "These three top tokens are seeing selling pressure build, as capital flows affect investor sentiment.\n\nToday's price action in the cryptocurrency world has been choppy, with many of the top tokens that investors watch closely seeing big declines over the past day. As of 3:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Bitcoin (BTC -0.63%), Ethereum (ETH -1.11%) and Dogecoin (DOGE -4.23%) had declined 3.9%, 4.9%, and 5.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThese moves appear to be the result of a shifting narrative in the crypto world. With more investors now focused on the flow of funds into this asset class, more recognition is being placed on the supply and demand of capital flows into this sector.\n\nAccordingly, the capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF (GBTC 1.49%), have become a much more pertinent focal point for Bitcoin and the entire sector in general.\n\nReports today that this particular spot Bitcoin ETF (and others) saw big capital outflows appear to be driving the majority of the move in these three top cryptos. The Grayscale ETF led the way lower, posting a $643 million outflow on Monday, with more expected to be reported today.\n\nLet's dive into this particular catalyst, as well as some other concerns that investors are pricing into Ethereum and Dogecoin right now.\n\nWhy the sentiment shift?\n\nCapital flows into spot ETFs aren't the only story, but they're the major one in the crypto space right now. With various spot Bitcoin ETFs such as Grayscale's seeing record inflows in such a short time, anticipation around a budding supply/demand dislocation in the Bitcoin market forced other speculative retail capital into the sector. For higher-risk assets such as Dogecoin, this led to what can only be described as a hype-driven rally.\n\nThere were also some recent comments from Elon Musk about potentially integrating Dogecoin further into the Tesla purchase ecosystem. We'll have to see whether that plays out or not, but it's clear that Dogecoin's primary purpose is to be a speculative trading vehicle for those willing to take abnormally large risks. In this market, that's worked out well for bulls.\n\nFor Ethereum, anticipation around pending deadlines for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review spot ETF applications from the likes of Grayscale and others continues to be a driving factor for this token.\n\nThat said, if capital outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs continue, this catalyst could be moot. Thus, investors are undoubtedly going to get ahead of the catalyst by pricing-in expectations, and we'll likely see Ethereum trade somewhat in line with Bitcoin until a decision is handed down.\n\nWhere to go from here\n\nInvestors who decided to jump on the crypto bandwagon before this flood of speculative capital surged into the sector have certainly done well for themselves. And while we have seen some recent capital outflows from the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF and others, it's also true that these ETFs have assets under management that many thought they wouldn't at this point in the cycle. So, it's really a matter of perception right now with respect to how the Bitcoin market is finding its balance.\n\nFor Ethereum and Dogecoin, I expect to see similar correlation with Bitcoin for some time, until we see the impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving and potential approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs. Until then, buckle your seat belts -- it's likely going to be a thrilling ride."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAmid a tumultuous week for the crypto market, ETH whales have made substantial moves, cashing out millions before Ethereum's price downturn. In the past four days of market downtime, three smart traders have offloaded a staggering 26,946 ETH, equivalent to a jaw-dropping $95.7 million. Their combined profits stand at an impressive $39 million, according to data from Spot On Chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first trader, identified as \"0xb82,\" executed a strategic move, selling 7,300 ETH for $24.4 million in stablecoins via Binance, netting a handsome profit of 22.7%, which is equivalent to a remarkable $4.59 million. Not far behind, \"0xebf\" deposited 8,870 ETH, valued at $33.1 million, onto Binance on March 16, reaping an estimated total profit of $25.3 million, an impressive 55.8% gain.\n\nLastly, \"0xa43\" sold 10,776 ETH for $38.2 million on March 15, realizing a notable $9.14 million profit, equating to a 31.5% gain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThese moves come against the backdrop of Ethereum's price plummeting over 11% since the start of the week. After reaching a two-year high of $4,093 last week, Ethereum faced a significant sell-off, driving its price down to $3,200 per ETH.\n\nCoinGlass reports that within the past 24 hours, positions totaling $120 million were liquidated, with an estimated 85% of them being long positions, suggesting a wave of sell-offs and profit-taking among investors.\n\nThe mass cash-outs by ETH whales amid the price drop raise questions about the future trajectory of Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. Whether the main altcoin finds a foothold will largely be both the cause and the consequence of how events develop further."

        "content": "Morph, a layer-2 Ethereum Virtual Machine, today announced a $19 million seed round led by Dragonfly Capital.\n\nMorph is a fully permissionless EVM L2 that uses a combination of optimistic and zero-knowledge rollup technology to enable a user-friendly option for developers who require a chain on which to build finance, gaming, social media, and entertainment apps.\n\nFrom a technical stance, Morph has focused on blockchain\u2019s trilemma problem\u2014how to balance decentralization, safety, and scalability.\n\n\u201cIf we want to really bring blockchain to the next step, into mass adoption, we have to find a vertical which can really create value that the end users realize\u2014so that\u2019s why we focus on the consumer side,\u201d Morph cofounder and CEO Cecilia Hsueh told Fortune.\n\nMorph is designed to offer the most \u201cfounder-friendly pipeline\u201d for projects in the L2 space, the company said in a statement. The technology is built within three key pillars: decentralized rollup technology, optimistic zkEVM integration, and modular design. Developers building on Morph have access to tools to help transition from the earliest stages of building up through a potential token listing.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first layer-2 on Ethereum to launch with a decentralized sequencer, meaning multiple entities or nodes can participate in the sequencing process, meaning the opportunity for any single node to manipulate transaction order is significantly reduced.\n\n\u201cThe existing L2 market is focused solely on short-term gains to be able to win the next casino round, rather than building for sustainable success. At Morph, we proudly help developers to create dApps that can truly make a long-term difference and win over a mainstream user base,\u201d cofounder and COO Azeem Khan said in a statement.\n\nThe company plans to use the fresh capital on hiring, marketing to bolster its visibility within the L2 ecosystem, and refining its technical infrastructure. Additional investors include Pantera, The Spartan Group, and MEXC, with a further $1 million raised in an angel round. Bitget, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, is an original investor in Morph and plans to continue playing a role in the Morph ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe believe Morph\u2019s technology can be exactly what developers in the consumer vertical need to pave the way for wider mainstream adoption,\u201d Paul Veradittakit, a managing partner at Pantera Capital, said in a statement."

        "title": "How Much Has the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Cut Layer-2 Gas Fees? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHeralded by Ethereum developers as the technical milestone they\u2019d been \u201cdreaming of,\u201d last week\u2019s Dencun upgrade was supposed to forever alter the Ethereum ecosystem\u2014by making transactions on its layer-2 networks exponentially cheaper and thus more accessible.\n\nOne week later, how do things stand?\n\nOn the whole, Dencun has delivered exactly as promised. Across layer-2 networks that have already integrated the software update, gas fees have plummeted to unprecedented lows, in most cases by over 90%.\n\nAt writing, median transaction fees on layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Starknet, Optimism, and Optimism-based chains Base and Zora have all fallen to one cent or below, according to data from Dune and Ethereum analytics platform Grow The Pie. That\u2019s a 91% to 95% drop in cost for each of those networks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2 hours ago, @arbitrum's gas fee dropped by another 80%. Now you only need 0.000004 ETH (about $0.01) to complete a transaction on this chain. This is fucking insane man! https://t.co/GgEv4AbGbz pic.twitter.com/2DNZlcLjmN \u2014 Larvandweb3.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Larvandweb3) March 19, 2024\n\nDay by day, those costs continue to fall\u2014from one cent down to mere fractions of a penny.\n\nEnabling Dencun\u2019s near-elimination of gas fees is a novel data storage solution called proto-danksharding, which is powered by blobs. Blobs allow layer-2 data to be stored on-chain for a temporary period of about a month, as opposed to forever\u2014the only previously available option.\n\nGm to 4844, welcome to @Optimism & @base Swaps now costing 1/10 of a cent Modularity scales. pic.twitter.com/CcZPshm836 \u2014 AureliusBTC (@AureliusBTC) March 14, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDencun\u2019s drastic reduction of on-chain fees has impacted not just ETH transfers and token swaps, but also heftier NFT-related transactions.\n\nOn Zora\u2014a layer 2 network built by the homonymous NFT minting platform\u2014the most common transactions are (expectedly) NFT transfers. Nonetheless, the median transaction cost on the network is currently 9/10ths of a penny.\n\nCompare those minuscule figures with the Ethereum mainnet, where an NFT sale currently costs $72 on average, per Etherscan. Just weeks ago, due to network clogs, that cost neared $400 per NFT transfer.\n\nThis is huge Reducing transaction fees and confirmation times on Layer 2 will open up so many more use cases for crypto. We're finally getting scalability. https://t.co/X7K3TzkMno \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) March 14, 2024\n\nNot all layer-2 networks are quite there yet, however. Some are taking a bit longer to integrate Dencun-related updates across their settlement contracts. Polygon, for instance, has yet to see its gas fees fully drop off; mean transaction costs on the network are currently hovering around $0.72. Polygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman previously told Decrypt that he expects all layer-2s, including Polygon, will be fully integrated with Dencun within a month or two.\n\nWhile the impact of Dencun is clearly already substantial, some critics outside the Ethereum ecosystem\u2014and even developers within it\u2014have noted that transaction costs are likely to rise with increasing network traffic.\n\nWhile blob-enabled L2 gas prices are very cheap right now, we can expect them to increase a bit over time as demand for blobs increases. This is expected behavior & is why 4844 is only the beginning - blobs are an evolving primitive & are part of the wider danksharding roadmap. \u2014 sassal.eth/acc \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@sassal0x) March 14, 2024\n\nAnd yet, most layer-2s with slashed gas fees have already seen dramatic increases in network activity. Daily transaction volume has more than doubled on Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, and Zora in the week since the upgrade; on Starknet, it has almost tripled. Gas fees on all those networks are still currently one cent or less on average.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany L2 developers hope that such sustained drops will prompt a fundamental shift in how users engage with Ethereum\u2014moving the bulk of routine transactions onto L2s, and away from the costly mainnet.\n\nBut recent gains of layer 2s don\u2019t appear to be at L1\u2019s detriment\u2014at least not yet. Traffic on the Ethereum mainnet remains consistent with figures from the past year, according to Etherscan; in fact, it\u2019s slightly up since last week.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Solana is now the top smart-contract blockchain by trading volume, surpassing Ethereum, according to data from DeFiLlama.\n\nThe volume of tokens trading on Solana-based decentralized exchanges, aka DEXs, climbed by 67% to $21.3 billion over seven days, whereas volume on Ethereum-based equivalent exchanges rose by just 3% to $19.4 billion. Likewise, the number of daily active addresses on Solana has also spiked, rising from 400,000 to 600,000 in January to February to roughly 1.25 million on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA lot of the surge we\u2019ve seen in Solana DEX trading volumes will likely come from the memecoin wave that we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks,\u201d Martin Lee, a data analyst at Nansen, told Fortune.\n\nSpeculative buzz around Solana-based memecoins dogwifwhat (WIF), bonk (BONK), book of meme (BOME), MAGA (TRUMP), and slerf (SLERF) is partially behind Solana\u2019s recent successes. On March 13, 2,300 Solana memecoins were minted in one hour, meanwhile stablecoins on Solana reached a multiyear high of $2.80 billion.\n\nIn the last 1 hour, 2,500 Solana memecoins were created. \u2014 Ram Ahluwalia CFA, Lumida (@ramahluwalia) March 13, 2024\n\nThe speculative frenzy behind Solana\u2019s memecoins has been catalyzed by a trend called \u201cpresales\u201d whereby tokens are sold before officially launching. A buyer sends funds to a crypto address and receives the set number of tokens at a later date. Some estimate that over $100 million worth of tokens were sent to various memecoin presales over the weekend, mainly on the Solana blockchain, CoinDesk reported.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bastion of memecoins attracting users with the lure of outsized returns: Speculation on these are likely currently driving an influx of users, but I\u2019m hopeful that new entrants will stick around,\u201d Philip Forte, founder and CEO of Elixir, told Fortune.\n\nThe hype of presales has grown with the success of BOME. Last week, its creator took to X to offer a presale, and the result was that early investors turned a few hundred dollars into hundreds of thousands over a few days. Meanwhile, BOME\u2019s market capitalization soared from zero to $1.6 billion in a few days, with over $100 million in daily trading volume, CoinDesk reported.\n\nThis BOME presale meta is the worst thing to happen in this space in a while https://t.co/06cOaB48W7 \u2014 Franz (@Franz_0x) March 17, 2024\n\nBut the presale frenzy has drawn criticism from some on-chain watchers, with one X user posting: \u201c2 years later and everyone is right back to bidding ponzis. People can do what they want with their money but sending money to a \u2018memecoin presale\u2019 that has a 99.9% chance of rugging is actually just dumb as hell.\u201d (BOME prices did drop after its launch, about 50% at the week\u2019s start\u2014steeper than a wider market correction.)\n\n\u201cThe reason Solana is able to capture all the memecoin volume as opposed to ETH L2s is because Solana\u2019s transactions fees have been historically much lower,\u201d Pat Doyle, Blockchain Researcher at Amberdata, told Fortune. \u201cThis makes investing in the speculative memecoins much more attractive as you don\u2019t have a larger percentage of your transfer consumed by fees.\u201d\n\nDoyle added: \u201cLooking at this from a broader view, the memecoin craze is showing the ability for Solana to handle high volume and throughput.\u201d\n\nAnd, to be fair, many investors had an eye on Solana before the latest memecoin boom: The blockchain\u2019s native token SOL\u2014though down about 8% today, to $168\u2014is up almost 70% in 2024.\n\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at Solana Foundation, told Fortune in a statement that although the company expects some of the new users associated with the memecoin blitz to exit, \"We see this as a catalyst for a wave of new users to discover the usability and power of the Solana network\u2014and stay for the long term.\""

We advise that Coinbase Wallet customers wait for congestion to resolve before submitting transactions on the Base network.\"\n\nFollowing the initial publication of this story, Coinbase representatives sent the following statement to Decrypt:\n\n\"Due to high network traffic on the Base network, transaction fees increased over the last 24 hours. Some user transactions that were submitted with lower fees may be stuck in a 'pending' state. If possible, users with pending transactions should cancel their transaction and resubmit with the latest estimated gas fee. If you are unable to cancel your pending transaction, the transaction will complete once traffic subsides. Rest assured, your funds are safe. Pending transactions will process once fees reduce. The Coinbase Wallet team is working on implementing a transaction cancellation feature, and will provide an update once available.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBase transactions have spiked dramatically in recent days following last week's launch of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, which promised to cut transaction fees on layer-2 scaling networks. Indeed, Base\u2014which is based on Optimism's scaling tech\u2014has seen a dramatic decrease in fees, falling by 90% or more alongside some other networks.\n\nPublic blockchain data curated by Dune shows a sizable leap on transaction volume on Base, rising from a daily average of about 400,000 daily transactions before the Dencun upgrade to a million or more each of the last several days. Base hit a new daily transaction record of 2.12 million on Saturday.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details."

ETH price is down 7% on the day and almost 20% on the week, wiping out recent gains.

The three Ethereum whales sold 26,946 Ether, worth $95.7 million, and took $39 million in profits. The transactions took place on Binance between March 15 and 19.\n\nAs whales shed their Ether, the altcoin\u2019s supply on exchanges has increased. Between March 15 and 19, ETH reserves on exchanges are up from 13.92 million to 14.43 million. An increase in supply on exchanges implies there is a higher volume of Ether available to sell.\n\nAs seen in the Santiment chart below, Ethereum price declined alongside this supply increase, supporting the thesis that profit-taking has partly driven the drop in Ether\u2019s price.\n\nSupply on Exchanges. Sources: Santiment\n\nEthereum price could sweep $2,900\n\nEthereum price is strongly correlated to Bitcoin. Therefore, the price decline seen in BTC likely helped Ethereum\u2019s price to drop as well alongside factors like profit taking and whale activity.\n\nETH price is on the verge of dipping into the range between $2,717 and $3,200, represented by the Fair Value Gap (FVG) on its monthly chart. Once the altcoin collects liquidity in this zone, its price could rebound towards resistance at $3,500 (represented by R1 in the chart below).\n\nThe ETH/USDT 1-day chart shows that bears are taking over as the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator flashes red bars. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.05, close to the neutral zone, meaning ETH is not currently oversold. Should the RSI for ETH drop into the oversold zone, it would give a buy signal for sidelined buyers to step in.\n\n\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA daily candlestick close below $3,200 (the upper boundary of FVG) would result in a steeper correction that could send ETH price towards support at $2,166."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe odds of spot Ethereum ETF emerging anytime soon are looking increasingly dire, but some crypto experts say that may be for the better.\n\n\u201cSpot Ethereum ETFs will gather more assets if they launch in December versus if they launch in May,\u201d wrote Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cTradFi needs more time to digest the Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs, which hit the U.S. market on January 11, have absorbed $12 billion in net inflows since launch. One of those ETFs belongs to Bitwise itself, which now holds nearly $2 billion in BTC on behalf of clients.\n\nHougan has repeatedly argued that there is still ample room for greater adoption of Bitcoin ETFs by the traditional financial world, and that certain target markets\u2014like corporations and wirehouses\u2014are still \u201cplugging in\u201d to the asset.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA survey released by Bitwise in early January, however, found substantially less interest in Ethereum among financial advisors. At the end of last year, 71% of respondents favored Bitcoin, compared to a roughly 50/50 split in 2022.\n\n\u201cAside from Bitcoin (which is in a class of its own), the most excitement I've heard in terms of real-world use is around stablecoins,\u201d added Hougan, based on his attendance at the institutionally-focused Blockworks DAS conference. \u201cSeems clear to me that stablecoins will be a multi-trillion market by the end of 2025.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF experts are apparently of the same mind: earlier this month, analyst Eric Balchunas said that Ethereum spot ETF would be \u201csmall potatoes\u201d next to their Bitcoin-based counterparts.\n\nI tend to agree. (Bitwise doesn't have an active spot #Ethereum ETF Filing before the SEC) https://t.co/htJZF1JRas \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) March 19, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNeither Balchunas nor his associate, James Seyffart, believe such ETFs are likely to receive approval by May 23, which is the SEC\u2019s final deadline for approving or deny he first wave of applications for the product.\n\n\u201c[Regulators] need to start having convos with the issuers ASAP and they don\u2019t seem to be doing that based on anything we\u2019ve seen thus far,\u201d wrote Seyffart on Monday.\n\nFurther impacting the odds for some issuers\u2014including Fidelity and Ark\u2014is the promise to stake a portion of their fund\u2019s assets to earn a yield from the Ethereum network. Blockchain staking and proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies are already in dicey legal territory with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), held solidly in the spotlight in many of the agency\u2019s lawsuits against the crypto industry.\n\nJames Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, believes an SEC decision on the ETFs may be delayed until the third quarter of 2024 or later due to unresolved issues around staking.\n\n\u201cCurrently, it appears that incorporating staking within a grantor trust is not feasible,\u201d Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cGiven the SEC's history of postponements, as observed with Grayscale over ten years and Blackrock last September, the likelihood of further delays is high,\u201d he continued. \u201cWith much optimism placed on May, investors might face disappointment.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. What are altcoins? Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. What is Bitcoin Dominance? Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies. Bitcoin price could drop 12% to the weekly imbalance area\n\nBitcoin price has formed a Head-and-Shoulders pattern on the daily timeframe, forecasting a 12% drop if the technical formation plays out. The market is leaning towards the downside, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nose-diving to signify momentum is falling.\n\nThe Awesome Oscillator (AO) is also edging towards the mean level with its histogram bars flashing red. If the bears have their way, BTC price could drop into the weekly imbalance, stretching from $52,985 to $59,005.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls are able to flip the neckline of the Head-and-Shoulders pattern into support, Bitcoin price could extend north to negate the bearish thesis above the $69,000 threshold.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price provides yet another lower buying opportunity 30 days to BTC halving\n\nEthereum price eyes a 10% drop\n\nEthereum price has slipped below the most critical Fibonacci retracement level, 61.8% at $3,365, with eyes now peeled on the 50% Fibonacci placeholder at $3,137.\n\nWith the RSI nose-diving below the mean level as momentum falls fast, coupled with the AO histogram bars drawing towards negative territory, Ethereum price could drop 10% to find inflection around $3,013 before ETH is attractive for buying.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if the bulls increase their buying pressure at current levels, Ethereum price could pull north, breaching resistance due to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $3,691.\n\nA flip of this roadblock into support would motivate the late bulls to buy ETH, with the ensuing buying pressure sending ETH price north to record a higher high above the peak of the market range at $4,105. This would constitute a 25% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2 bridge deposits skyrocket after Dencun Upgrade\n\nThis bearish divergence could send XRP price lower\n\nRipple price has recorded higher lows, while the RSI has produced lower lows, culminating in a potential weakening momentum or a trend reversal.

This would constitute a drop of around 11% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a recovery by the bulls could see XRP price restore above the 50% Fibonacci placeholder at $0.6152. Enhanced buying pressure above this level could see the price confront the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 0.6460, where stiff resistance is expected.\n\nOvercoming this level would be the signal the skeptics might need to come in en masse and push XRP price further north.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating the Ethereum Foundation and companies doing business with the nonprofit, according to a new report from Fortune Wednesday. And that\u2019s very bad news for crypto enthusiasts who were hopeful that spot Ether ETFs, which would make it easier for investors to invest in the cryptocurrency without holding it personally, would be approved by regulators soon.\n\nThe news comes after CoinDesk first noticed on Wednesday that the Ethereum Foundation had recently included a note on Github about being investigated by an unnamed \u201cstate authority.\u201d The spokesperson for the SEC told Gizmodo via email on Wednesday that, \u201cThe SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the SEC\u2019s apparent investigation, according to people who spoke with Fortune, is to classify Ethereum as a security. The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has previously said Bitcoin isn\u2019t a security but should be classified as a commodity while suggesting practically all other crypto coins are securities.\n\nFrom Fortune:\n\nAccording to a person at a company who received a recent subpoena request, the SEC\u2019s probe of the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation began shortly after the blockchain\u2019s shift to a new governance model known as \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d in September of 2022.\n\nThat proof-of-stake event moved the blockchain away from the energy-intensive model used by Bitcoin in favor of one that relies on a trusted network of validators\u2014and provided the SEC with a new pretext to attempt to define Ethereum as a security, according to people at three different companies familiar with the subpoenas. The people asked Fortune not identify to identify them or their firms for fear of retaliation by the agency\u2019s chair, Gary Gensler, who one described as \u201cvindictive.\u201d\n\nWhy does it matter if Ethereum is a security? That means Ethereum and the exchanges that trade it will be subject to tighter enforcement from the SEC.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has ticked down roughly 14% over the past five days though it\u2019s still up 98% in the past six months. The crypto coin was trading at roughly $1,600 in late September.\n\nEthereum was created in 2015 by programmer Vitalik Buterin after he rather famously became frustrated that his favorite World of Warcraft character\u2019s capabilities were degraded. To Buterin, that was when he \u201crealized what horrors centralized services can bring,\u201d leading him to create an ostensibly decentralized crypto coin.\n\nButerin is estimated to be worth about $400 million, according to Forbes, down from about $1.4 billion in 2021."

        "title": "Ethereum Price: Can ETH Price Cross $8K in 2024? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum price has been a victim of the crypto market crash having experienced a drop in its value. ETH\u2019s market performance chart shows a red pattern over the past week with an 18.88% decrease. With an increase of 86% in its value year-to-date the market seems optimistic for the token to hit $8,000 by the end of the year. Let\u2019s find out how possible this is.\n\nFactors Driving Ethereum Price to $8,000\n\nThe Standard Chartered Bank has mentioned the approval of ETH ETFs and the recent Dencan upgrade as possible drivers of Ethereum price to $8,000 by end of 2024.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. Ethereum Price Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Standard Chartered Bank believes that Ethereum\u2019s recent Dencun upgrade will enhance its competitiveness by reducing transaction fees on Layer 2 networks. He predicts that the importance of the \u201cbridge\u201d category will increase as a result of this upgrade.\n\nAdditionally, the bank foresees Ethereum\u2019s future use cases shifting towards gaming and tokenization, which will create a substantial demand through NFT and DeFi channels. It emphasized that this will serve as proof of concept for real-world industries to leverage Ethereum\u2019s advantages over their current systems.The bank expects significant advancements in these areas by 2025-26.\n\n2. Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n\nThe Standard Chartered Bank has also forecasted that if a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) is approved in the US, Ether could potentially reach $8,000 by the end of this year. It asserts that the ETF inflows are likely for Ethereum (ETH) as it benefits from being considered the \u201cbig tech\u201d of digital assets.\n\nThe bank anticipates that the US SEC will approve ETH ETFs on 23 May, which is the final deadline for the first batch of applications. This timeline aligns with the SEC\u2019s previous approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in January 2024.\n\nStandard Chartered bullish on Bitcoin and ETH. Bitcoin TP:\n\n2024: $150k\n\n2025: $200k \u2013 $250k ETH TP:\n\n2024: 8k\n\n2025: 14k pic.twitter.com/Ahfc2KKVOY \u2014 bearishbiasjedi (@FinBizJedi) March 18, 2024\n\nAdditionally, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in the UK has announced that it will accept applications for ETH and BTC ETFs, increasing the chances of US approval.\n\nThere is an expectation of a significant influx of ETH through ETFs, similar to what was seen with BTC ETFs after their approval. Standard Chartered Bank estimates suggest that spot ETFs could bring in approximately 2.39-9.15 million ETH within the first year of approval, equivalent to around USD 15-45 billion. This inflow as a percentage of market cap is comparable to the previous estimates for BTC ETFs, which have proven to be accurate.\n\nIf ETH ETFs receive approval in the US on 23 May as anticipated, there will be greater potential for price growth than previously thought. ETH is expected to keep pace with BTC, maintaining the current 5.4% price ratio throughout 2024. Considering the bank\u2019s projection of BTC reaching USD 150,000 by the end of 2024, this would imply a price of USD 8,000 for ETH.\n\nWill spot Ethereum ETFs Be Approved?\n\nVarious scenarios are showing that Ethereum ETFs approval is unlikely.\n\n1. Analysts\u2019 Lowered Expectations\n\nMany analysts have become less hopeful about the idea due to regulators\u2019 apparent lack of communication on the matter. The current prediction markets on Polymarket suggest that there is a 28% chance of a spot ether ETF being approved by the end of May. This is a notable decrease from the 74% odds on Polymarket back on January 10, when spot bitcoin ETFs were given the green light.\n\nBloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has revised his prediction for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 30%, down from 70% in January. Balchunas stated, \u201cWe are now at 30% odds.\u201d In contrast, his colleague James Seyffart had previously estimated a 60-65% chance of approval. Seyffart expressed his growing pessimism, stating that the current situation for an Ethereum ETF approval feels opposite to the odds for a bitcoin ETF approval. With only approximately 73 days left until the deadline, there appears to be minimal progress or development.\n\n2. Political Pressure on the SEC\n\nIt is unlikely that Ethereum ETFs will be approved this year due to increased political pressure on the Securities and Exchange Commission to only allow ETFs for Ethereum.\n\nSenators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler have urged SEC Chairman Gensler to refrain from approving more cryptocurrency ETFs to protect investors. They argue that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January has opened the door for Wall Street to sell risky crypto investments to the public. The senators believe that allowing more crypto ETFs would expose investors to fraud and manipulation in thinly traded markets.\n\nThey express concerns about proposed Ethereum ETF applications and the possibility of other altcoins being approved. Reed and Butler emphasize the risks retail investors would face from ETPs, which could be susceptible to fraudulent schemes. They call for greater regulatory oversight on BTC ETF brokers and advisors to safeguard investor interests.\n\nThe success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. @SenatorJackReed and @Senlaphonza write to the @SECGov urging:\n\n-no further ETPs for other tokens\n\n-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N \u2014 Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) March 14, 2024\n\nBalchunas believes the success of the Bitcoin ETF has caused regret among Democrats, impacting the approval chances of an ETH ETF. Balchunas noted the Senators\u2019 focus on correlations between ETH futures and spot prices as a potential indicator of future actions by the SEC. He speculated that the SEC may have provided information to the Senators. The analyst also pointed out the technical term \u201cETP\u201d for 33 Act funds and suggested SEC involvement in drafting the letter. Overall, he sees the letter as a sign of potential rejection of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nETH Price Current Status\n\nEthereum price is currently at $3,266.05 having decreased by 9.00% over the past day. The token is below its all-time high of $4,891 it achieved on November 16, 2021, which investors are hoping it will hit and surpass during this bull run year. There is quite substantial activity going on in the market regarding ETH as demonstrated by a 63% increase in the 24-hour trading volume. It still holds the second position according to CoinMarketCap, boasting a market cap of $392.18 billion and a circulation supply of 120 million ETH.\n\nPrice Forecast: Will Ethereum Price Hit $8,000?\n\nETH is likely to encounter a lot of obstacles in reaching $8,000 by the end of the year, based on the current technical indicators. The 200-day EMA and MACD signals show a strong bearish sentiment, indicating that the price may face more downward pressure. Although there might be temporary recoveries, the overall trend seems difficult for a significant price rise. Traders and investors should keep an eye on important support and resistance levels, as well as the general market sentiment, to accurately assess ETH\u2019s future path."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nXai, the gaming-centric Ethereum network built on Arbitrum scaling technology, could add a heap of games by year\u2019s end thanks to a new collaboration with a prominent indie gaming curator called The MIX.\n\nThe MIX, or The Media Indie Exchange, says that it could launch more than 100 games on the layer-3 Xai network before the end of 2024 and that we should see the first of those games live within 60 days. No games have been confirmed yet, however, as they will be announced individually.\n\n\u201cWe already have a number of games confirmed and a large pipeline of games that we expect to confirm in the short term,\u201d The MIX owner and co-founder Justin Woodward told Decrypt\u2019s GG. \u201cBy the end of the year, we anticipate deploying at least dozens, if not over 100, games to Xai through this partnership.\u201d\n\nOver the last 12 years, The MIX has served as connective tissue between indie game developers, publishers, and the media, presenting curated gaming showcases and developing content around such events. With those connections in place and having shown hundreds of games via its events, The MIX now aims to onboard some of those creators to Web3.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn many cases, it appears that the games coming via The MIX will be completed \u201cWeb2\u201d games that can be adapted for the blockchain market via Xai\u2019s software development kit (SDK)\u2014though the company will also help facilitate crypto games being built from scratch for Xai.\n\n\u201cXai offers an SDK that simplifies the process for Web2 games and their users to access the advantages of Web3 through a straightforward implementation,\u201d said Woodward. \u201cMany games will utilize this technology, which is completely abstracted from the user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cA smaller group of games are building Web3 foundations from the start,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be exciting to see the creativity of indie game developers experimenting with Web3 tech.\u201d\n\nWoodward said that the Xai implementation in upcoming games could bear a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to how game publisher Valve has allowed players on the Steam platform to buy and sell in-game items in Web2 games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. But unlike in traditional games, players won't be locked to a certain storefront or marketplace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUltimately, it's up to the game developers to determine how they utilize it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe MIX lives in the traditional gaming space, albeit aligned more with indie creators than major publishing giants. Even so, there\u2019s been plenty of skepticism around crypto games in the Web2 world. On the other hand, game studios are reeling from mass layoffs, and the industry is in disarray. Are game developers coming around to crypto distribution channels?\n\n\u201cThere will continue to be some pushback,\u201d Woodward admitted, \u201cbut developers have been more responsive to Xai because the Web3 elements are pushed behind the scenes and don't affect the user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's also important to acknowledge how Web3 has helped indie game developers bootstrap community,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen examining Xai's socials, it's clear they have built a rabid community ready to play games by leveraging their technology. This presents an opportunity for indie game developers to connect with and grow their audience. Blockchain is merely a technological component.\u201d\n\nThe MIX is currently holding an event at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in collaboration with gaming content studio Kinda Funny.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is reportedly under investigation by a State Authority, a new update disclosed through the protocol\u2019s GitHub repository.\n\nThe Unclear Inquiry Into Ethereum Foundation\n\nAccording to the GitHub update, the disclosure of the inquiry was made weeks ago, marking the first time any State Authority will be issuing such a probe into the Ethereum blockchain developer.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThis commit removes a section of the footer as we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality,\u201d said Pablo Pettinari, one of the core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, in a commit on February 26.\n\nThe GitHub commit showed the removal of contact, another bizarre trend that negates its core tenets of transparency. The inquiry also led to the removal of a canary that represented the Ethereum network from the foundation\u2019s website. Per the Wayback Machine data, this canary feature and its associated text were present in January.\n\nThe community has been thrown into undue speculation following the breaking of the inquiry. With the Ethereum Foundation currently not sharing additional details about the probe, any potential fallout in the long term will go a long way in helping stakeholders understand what the core challenge is.\n\nEthereum remains a controversial digital currency as it relates to its security classification. Through a series of intricate events, there are allegations of a likely conflict of interest with Jay Clayton, the former Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who filed a lawsuit against XRP days before leaving office.\n\nMany in the community postulated that this lawsuit was directed at XRP to stump competition, however, there is no evidence at the moment to connect this with the current State Authority inquiry.\n\nWhile the price of Ethereum recorded a knee-jerk reaction to the news, there is stability in the market at the moment. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum has recorded a 0.82% uptick with its price pegged at $3,316.02. To complement this rare bullish twist, the coin\u2019s trading volume is up 8.45% to $34,886,760,871.\n\nCrypto Entities and Federal Probes\n\nJust as the Ethereum Foundation is facing a probe by a State Authority, other crypto-based entities have had their fair share of related probes in recent times.\n\nBinance was under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) for years, a probe that ended in a settlement last year. The settlement, which is worth about $4.3 billion in monetary terms, was regarded as one of the largest scores by the DoJ, FinCEN, and CFTC at the time. It also led to the resignation of co-founder and former CEO Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao from the company.\n\nBesides this historic event, other platforms including Coinbase Global Inc. remain in a tight legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over some of its offerings.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Ethereum price started a recovery wave from the $3,050 zone. ETH is up over 10% and is now struggling to clear the $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum started a decent recovery wave from the $3,050 zone.\n\nThe price is trading above $3,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to rise if it settles above the $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Starts Recovery\n\nEthereum price extended its decline below the $3,350 and $3,200 levels, like Bitcoin. ETH even declined below the $3,150 support level before the bulls appeared. It tested the $3,050 zone.\n\nA low was formed at $3,059 and the price is moving higher. There was a strong recovery wave above the $3,350 resistance. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low.\n\nThere was also a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,520 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,550 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,675, above which the price might gain bullish momentum.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,820 level. If there is a move above the $3,820 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,080.\n\nAnother Decline In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,380 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,320 zone. The next key support could be the $3,220 zone. A clear move below the $3,220 support might send the price toward $3,150. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,380\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,550"

        "title": "Solana surpasses Ethereum on DEX - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "It is not the first time it happens, but the fact that the volume of trades on decentralized exchanges on Solana has exceeded that of DEX on Ethereum always makes headlines.\n\nEthereum not only has existed since 2015, but has been dominating the world of DeFi uncontested for years now.\n\nSolana instead landed on the crypto markets just under four years ago, but has transaction fees that are far lower.\n\nSolana\u2019s Overtake on Ethereum\n\nIt should be noted, however, that in terms of key metrics Solana has not yet surpassed Ethereum.\n\nBy market capitalization SOL (the native cryptocurrency of Solana) is around 75 billion dollars, just surpassed by BNB with 78. ETH, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is still on another level, with 386 billion dollars.\n\nFor TVL (Total Value Locked on DeFi protocols), Ethereum surpasses everyone with its 46 billion dollars, with Solana in fourth place with only 3.7 billion, surpassed also by Tron as well as BSC. However, the majority of TVL on Tron is due to USDT, while in the Solana ecosystem it is due to DEX.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the overtaking occurred precisely on decentralized exchanges, especially in terms of daily trading volumes.\n\nMoreover, even among DEXs, Uniswap still dominates in terms of TVL, although now a portion of its trading volumes does not occur on Ethereum but on layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n\nUsing as a reference the trading volumes per chain, in the last seven days Solana has exceeded 21 billion dollars, while Ethereum stopped at 19.\n\nHowever, it should be added that there have been more than 6 billion dollars in trading on Arbitrum, so overall the Ethereum ecosystem with its layer-2 still surpasses the Solana ecosystem.\n\nNote that in third place in this ranking there is BSC, with 12 billion, and in fourth place Avalanche with 4.\n\nThe reason for the overtaking\n\nThere are two reasons that have led to this overtaking.\n\nThe first, simply, is the much lower fees on transactions.\n\nIn fact, it is no coincidence that the fifth chain by trading volume on DEXs is Arbitrum, the main layer-2 solution for Ethereum that enables transactions at very low costs.\n\nSolana still has lower costs, so it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s the preferred chain at the moment.\n\nHowever, there was another reason behind this boom.\n\nThe boom of memecoins played an important role.\n\nMany memecoins are now being launched on low-cost chains, such as Solana or even Base. Moreover, anyone can list their new token on a decentralized exchange, so DEXs are the ideal place to launch new memecoins.\n\nIt was a real boom, with some truly colossal proportions.\n\nIn the last 1 hour, 2,500 Solana memecoins were created. \u2014 Ram Ahluwalia CFA, Lumida (@ramahluwalia) March 13, 2024\n\nNow that the temporary boom of memecoins seems to be fading, it is possible that Ethereum will return to dominate this ranking, even though Arbitrum has now become a strong competitor.\n\nThe historical volumes\n\nHowever, the situation changes if historical volumes are taken into consideration.\n\nOn a monthly basis, in March Ethereum still dominates with over 51 billion dollars so far, while Solana is at about 45.\n\nIn February, even BSC had surpassed Solana, with 25 billion dollars compared to 22.\n\nIn January, for example, Arbitrum had almost caught up with Solana, both at 22 billion, so it is evident that the overtaking of the last week is due to a perhaps temporary boom, largely driven by memecoins.\n\nIn November 2021, at the peak of the bubble, DEXs on Ethereum recorded a record of $107 billion in monthly trading volumes, followed by $74 billion on BSC.\n\nThey were numbers far superior to the current ones, so it seems that there is still room for growth for DEX. At that time Solana didn\u2019t even make it into the top 10, so in just over three years it has come a long way.\n\nEven Arbitrum has grown a lot, because back then it was under 4 billion, while in the first 20 days of March 2024 it is already over 18.\n\nThe prices of SOL (Solana) and ETH (Ethereum)\n\nInterestingly, both ETH and SOL are currently priced 34% below their all-time high.\n\nHowever, in the last seven days ETH is losing 20%, while SOL is gaining 12%. Also since the beginning of the year SOL is performing better, with a +68% compared to the +42% of ETH.\n\nThe key point to understand these differences actually lies in the bear market of 2022/2023.\n\nETH in 2022 has dropped less, and in 2023 it immediately recovered together with BTC.\n\nInstead SOL lost much more in 2022, and especially in 2023 it recovered only in October, when the entire crypto market restarted.\n\nAlthough in some ways it may seem that Solana is challenging Ethereum, in reality for now it is still the latter that dominates, even on DEX (especially thanks to its second layer)."

        "title": "Ethereum rejected $4,000: Crypto analysis of March 20, 2024 - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nAfter reaching the $4,000 threshold, Ethereum has entered a corrective phase of 25%. Let\u2019s examine the future outlook for ETH together.\n\nSituation of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nAfter marking a high at $4,100, the price of Ethereum has begun a downward movement, countering its last bullish phase active since $2,100. Indeed, the price of Ethereum regained, on the morning of this Wednesday, March 20, $3,050. It is worth noting that this drop occurred after the Dencun update. Has the price of the cryptocurrency already integrated this news? What is certain is that the fall of Bitcoin has contributed to that of Ethereum. The $3,700 support was not solid enough, just like those at $3,500 and $3,200. However, it can be observed that the price of Ethereum rebounded on the Fibonacci 50% level, taken into account from $2,100. Thus, a buying pressure seems to be identified at this level.\n\nEthereum is currently just above its 50-day moving average. The structure remains bullish, but a move of ETH below this threshold could cast doubt on this perspective. As for Ethereum\u2019s bullish momentum, it\u2019s not surprising that it has been revised down, given the direction taken by oscillators and the price of Ethereum itself.\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and trader passionate about the cryptocurrency markets. Today a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of self-funded traders active since 2017. There you will find live sessions, educational content, and mutual assistance around financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere.\n\nZoom on Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest on ETH/USDT contracts experienced a notable decrease. This reduction came with a liquidation mainly on the buy side and a reduction in the funding rate, hinting at some capitulation by buyers. It is crucial to mention that a reduction in the funding rate can be interpreted positively when it is considered excessively high. Indeed, it may signal a readjustment towards a healthier balance between the market and its underlying asset, thereby helping to alleviate selling pressure that could weigh on these contracts.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USD\n\nThe heat map of ETH/USDT liquidations over a month reveals that the cryptocurrency is just above a strong liquidation area in a price range between $3,000 and $2,800. Above the current price, there is also an area around $4,100, corresponding to the last peak reached by ETH. As the price approaches these levels, a massive trigger of orders could occur, thus increasing the risk of a period of heightened volatility for Ethereum. These zones thus represent a critical point of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (1 month)\n\nHypotheses for the Price of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nIf the price of Ethereum stays above $3,000, one could anticipate a bullish continuation up to the $3,600 level. The next resistance to consider, if the bullish move continues, would be $4,100. At that point, it would represent an increase of more than +26%.\n\nIf the price of Ethereum fails to maintain above $3,000, we could envision a return to $2,900 or even $2,800. The next support to consider, if the downward movement continues, would be around $2,700. At this stage, that would represent a drop of nearly -15%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter experiencing a peak at $4,100, Ethereum underwent a significant bearish correction, despite a notable rebound to $3,050, a dynamic partly attributed to the influence of Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuations. Although support at various levels was compromised, the rebound observed at the Fibonacci 50% level shows a certain resilience and potential buying pressure. Thus, the cryptocurrency\u2019s structure remains bullish. However, it will be crucial to closely monitor the price reaction at various key levels to confirm or refute the current hypotheses. It is also important to remain vigilant to potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let\u2019s remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria, and the price of cryptocurrencies can otherwise evolve rapidly depending on other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "US SEC is reportedly investigating Ethereum Foundation, according to a report by Fortune\n\nA post on a similar investigation was made on the Ethereum Foundation GitHub in February 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency in the market, seems to have finally fallen under the radar of the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC). According to a report by Fortune, SEC has started a \u201clegal campaign\u201d to classify ETH as a security. And, the infamous crypto regulator has served several subpoenas to several companies in relation to an investigation on Ethereum.\n\nSEC reportedly probing Ethereum Foundation\n\nNotably, the commission is seeking for any information and financial records on their relationship with Ethereum Foundation \u2013 the non-profit organization that spearheads the development and governance of the blockchain. Moreover, the investigation started right after Ethereum made a huge technical shift \u2013 changing its consensus mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake mechanism (PoS).\n\nThe development emerges hours after it was reported that a US state authority was investigating Ethereum Foundation, according to a Github commit. A February 26 commit by Pablo Pettinari, a front-end developer said, \u201cThis commit removes a section of the footer as we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.\u201d In addition to this, the commit also had deleted text that said,\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not to be disclosed. Stiftung Ethereum will publicly disclose any sort of inquiry from government agencies that falls outside the scope of regular business operations\u201d\n\nInvestigation in parallel with Spot Ethereum ETF fate\n\nNotably, the investigation seems to be taking momentum right when the market is expecting the commission to give a green card to a spot Ethereum ETF. The crypto community, particularly the Ethereum community, has been on high the end given that the first application came from Blackrock \u2013 the investment management giant.\n\nThe firm had filed for an spot ETH ETF right after it got an approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. And, this move was quickly mirrored by other players such as Fidelity, Hashdex, and ARK Invest. Notably, Fidelity is also looking into providing traders with the option of staking a part of their holdings.\n\nHowever, with the ongoing investigation, it remains unknown how it would impact the applications. In today\u2019s update, the SEC has delayed VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF, a day after it delayed decision on Hashdex Nasdaq and ARK 21 Shares Ethereum ETF applications."

        "content": "Wed 20 Mar 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe bomb has been dropped. BlackRock has just declared war on crypto critics. By launching an unprecedented digital assets fund, the investment giant is sending a stinging message. The reign of cryptos is here. Institutional investors can now throw themselves into the fray, heading into the decentralized world. Massive crypto adoption starts today.\n\nThe crypto fund that\u2019s shaking Wall Street\n\nFrom the first hours, crypto investors scrambled for shares of the new fund. In a strong symbolic gesture, BlackRock deposited $100 million in USDC on the Ethereum network. Astonishment in traditional circles. Indifference feigned by seasoned bitcoiners.\n\nThis major event had the impact of an unequalled bombshell. In one fell swoop, the steamroller of institutional adoption of crypto got moving. Goodbye to byzantine digressions about \u201cthe speculative bubble\u201d. Welcome to an era of unparalleled recognition for decentralized digital assets.\n\nBecause in reality, BlackRock had simply followed the movement. Faced with the enthusiasm of its wealthy clients, it was impossible to lag behind any longer. The appetite was voracious for direct, secure, and regulated exposure to cryptos. Now satisfied by the firm\u2019s all-in offensive.\n\nThe devastating effect for the financial dinosaurs\n\nThe shockwaves of BlackRock\u2019s initiative will continue to grow in strength. Today, the entire traditional financial sphere is slowly imploding. A colossus with over $10 trillion in assets under management has publicly endorsed crypto by investing heavily in it.\n\nIn the face of this tidal wave, how can the outdated banks and managers maintain their anti-crypto stance? No chance. Overtaken by the insatiable appetite of their clients, they will have no choice but to submit in turn.\n\nInstitutional adoption will morph into a veritable digital gold rush. Hedge funds hungry for returns will join the fray without delay. Family offices and their billions of American dollars will dive in headfirst, forgetting the moralizing speeches of yesteryear.\n\nAlmost overnight, the world of finance will wake up crypto-compatible, almost crypto-native. A handful of holdouts entrenched in their retrograde stance will change nothing of the inevitable. BlackRock will have unlocked the flood gates of mass adoption. Nobody will come out unscathed.\n\nAt the helm, the ubiquitous BlackRock gives the starting signal. New onramps to the crypto ecosystem will emerge in abundance. Decentralized savings products, ETFs traded on exchanges, everything will be possible for the masses. The institutional rush will in turn generate massive popular adoption. And as the first dust settles, the most astute will realize. No, BlackRock won\u2019t just have opened the floodgates of crypto investment. The leviathan will have enabled us to step fully into the era of decentralized digital abundance. A new civilization is rising.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is Smart Money Buying Or Selling ETH At $3,300? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price prediction: Ether flirts with short-term support at $3,300 barely a week after climbing to a new yearly high of $4,095. For some investors this correction means panic.\n\nHowever, savvy participants, otherwise referred to as smart money, are acting by scooping up the liquidity following $122 million in liquidations, according to Coinglass data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: What\u2019s Next After Holding $3,300 Support\n\nTraders are deliberating whether to buy or short Ethereum price at $3,300 support. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to the dilemma, especially with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) bouncing back to 42 after testing near oversold levels (30 and below).\n\nThe bullish outlook from the RSI alone may not be enough to call for immediate buy orders, but if ETH price closes the day above $3,300, stability could begin to return on the battered market.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (RSI) which tracks the flow of money in and out of Ethereum shows that buyers are regaining strength. As more people bet on the dips, the MFI climbs towards the overbought region. In turn, buying pressure will ignite a new uptrend, aiming for gains above $4,000.\n\nIndicators like the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 50-day EMA, and the 20-day EMA signal that the correction in Ethereum may be far from over.\n\nAttempts to recover to $4,000 must take place aggressively, otherwise, more losses will could leave a deteriorated technical structure, resulting in prices dropping to $3,000 in the short term and $2,500 in the medium term.\n\nIt is also worth keeping in mind that Ethereum price currently holds below the previous day open at $3,520. A break above this level in this session could imply that Ethereum starts the next session on Wednesday stronger, encouraging traders to keep buying instead of selling.\n\nThe most robust resistance lies between $3,739 and $3,839, as highlighted by the IOMAP model graphically prepared by IntoTheBlock. More ETH coins are experiencing unrealized losses compared to those in profit. Precisely, 4.46 million ETH roughly 34% are in the money and 8.7 million ETH approximately 8.7 million ETH are out of the money.\n\nSupport areas have shrunk significantly since the weekend as observed with the green circles on the chart. Therefore, investors must move strategically to ensure that they avoid falling into more traps.\n\nThe most solid support in the range between $2,832 and $2,932 represents 1.61 million addresses which purchased 1.32 million ETH at an average price of $2,887. This region will come in handy for the bulls if downward pressure overwhelms the demand at $3,300 and $3,300 causing a larger sell-off.\n\nOn the upside, for Ethereum to strongly flip bullish, the price has to break above the thick supply area highlighted between $3,739 and $3,839. FOMO may kick in as ETH climbs above $4,000 bringing the all-time high above $4,800 within reach.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Ethereum: All factors that will dictate when ETH crosses $4K again - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "U.S. investors were crazy about Ethereum earlier this month.\n\nDespite the recent pullback, user activity and demand remained high.\n\nEthereum [ETH] was trading above the $4K mark for close to 48 hours in total in 2024. On the 12th and 13th of March, ETH poked its head briefly above this psychological level.\n\nAMBCrypto reported that supply on exchanges was low, meaning investors need not fear an intense wave of selling pressure.\n\nNew demand for ETH was at a YTD high and the Dencun upgrade went live on the 13th of March.\n\nThis upgrade was branded as the \u201cfirst step in a long-term strategy\u201d to make the network scale to \u201chundreds of thousands of transactions per second\u201d by Jesse Pollack, the creator of Base and Head of Protocols at Coinbase.\n\nThe Coinbase Premium grew to highs not seen since the first week of May 2023. This indicated an influx of demand from investors in the United States. However, this was affected by the recent pullback.\n\nU.S. investors were no longer entranced by Ethereum\n\nThe Coinbase Premium is the percentage gap between the Ethereum prices on Coinbase Pro (ETHUSD pair) and Binance (ETHUSDT pair). This metric has trended higher since the 24th of February.\n\nIt has a ceiling at the 0.05 reading since June 2023, but in March, this trend was flipped.\n\nThe index rose as high as 0.23 on the 8th of March. Since then, it has taken a nosedive and fell to -0.1 on the 17th of March.\n\nThis showed that U.S. investors had been enamored by Ethereum earlier this month, but quickly snapped out of it as prices plunged below the $4K level.\n\nIn May 2023, ETH was in a longer-term downtrend when the index shot skyward. This time, Ethereum has embarked on a move that could potentially break its ATH.\n\nHence, the retreat by U.S. investors might pan out differently this time.\n\nSantiment metrics pointed toward strong demand\n\nThe active addresses count trended upward in the first half of March, just surpassing the January highs. It has fallen a bit since then but still maintained a lofty position.\n\nThis uptick in user demand for the network was a bullish development.\n\nThe Open Interest noted a decline alongside the prices to signal short-term bearish sentiment in the market.\n\nThe Funding Rate had been highly positive a week ago but retreated in the past few days, once again underlining a shift in sentiment.\n\nETH wallets with more than 10k tokens booked profits on their holdings earlier this month. This was seen by the swift drop in the supply distribution % figure for the 10k-1M ETH.\n\nThose holding less than 10k ETH did not change dramatically.\n\nThe whales deciding to cash out as prices approached the $4K mark indicated that studying whale behavior could help traders and analysts enormously.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nIn conclusion, some on-chain metrics indicated a bullish outlook. The price trend of Ethereum would remain bullish until we dive below the $3.1k level.\n\nTill then, bulls could treat these dips as discounted buying opportunities."

        "title": "Ethereum Not A Security, SEC Unlikely To Succeed: A16z - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The crypto industry finds itself at a pivotal juncture as the Swiss Ethereum Foundation received a \u201cvoluntary enquiry\u201d from an undisclosed \u201cstate authority\u201d which demanded confidentiality, as Bitcoinist reported yesterday. This revelation, made through the removal of the Warrant Canary from its website and a note in a Github repository, marks a first in the foundation\u2019s history.\n\nA little later, a report by Forbes surfaced, claiming that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the agency, trying to declare ETH as a security. This action comes in the wake of the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January and the looming mid-May deadline for spot ETH Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s inquiry seeks extensive documentation from US companies on their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, particularly after Ethereum\u2019s transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model. Seemingly, the SEC\u2019s probe of the Ethereum Foundation aims to categorize Ether as a security, particularly after Ethereum\u2019s transition to a PoS in September 2022.\n\nA16z SEC\u2019s Security Probe Into Ethereum\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s actions, Brian Quintenz, Global Head of Policy at Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), a leading venture capital firm with significant investments in the crypto space and $35 billion assets under management, has vocally opposed the SEC\u2019s attempt. Quintenz, through a series of statements on X (formerly Twitter), laid out a cogent argument against the SEC\u2019s probe.\n\nQuintenz stated, \u201cReminder: When the SEC allowed ETH Futures ETFs to trade on its regulated security exchanges, it explicitly acknowledged the status of the underlying, ETH, as being a non-security and outside of its jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nHe further elaborated on the significance of the SEC\u2019s decision post-Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, saying, \u201cImportantly, this [futures] ETF approval decision in October 2023 occurred well after Ethereum changed to PoS in Sept of 2022; meaning that to the SEC, ETH, in its present state as of Oct 2023, was not a security.\u201d\n\nQuintenz argues that any doubts regarding Ethereum\u2019s regulatory treatment should have been resolved with the futures ETF approval, indicating a clear stance from the SEC that Ethereum does not fall under its jurisdiction as a security.\n\nHighlighting the potential contradictions in the SEC\u2019s approach, Quintenz pointed out, \u201cIf the SEC had any doubt about the regulatory treatment of ETH in Oct 2023, it wouldn\u2019t have approved the ETF. If ETH were in fact a security, then the CFTC-listed futures contracts (on which the ETFs were based) would be illegal, as any derivative on ETH would be considered security futures contracts and subject to different rules, listed on different exchanges and subject to joint SEC/CFTC jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nCoinbase CLO Weighs In\n\nEchoing Quintenz\u2019s sentiments, Paul Grewal, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO), reinforced Ethereum\u2019s classification as a commodity rather than a security. Grewal took to X, articulating, \u201cMillions of Americans hold ETH; it has been vital to crypto since its 2015 launch; and ETH is a commodity, not a security.\u201d\n\nHe backed his argument with references to previous statements by SEC officials and the consistent position of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts. Notably, Grewal argued, \u201cEx. C. And even very recently, the SEC\u2019s trial lawyers continue to compare ETH to BTC,\u201d indicating a longstanding regulatory perspective that diverges from the current SEC probe.\n\nThe crux of the argument against Ethereum\u2019s classification as a security lies in the application of the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts. Grewal contended, \u201cEven if we were to apply Howey, ETH utterly fails that test, and nothing about the merge changes that conclusion.\u201d\n\nSigh\u2026 again with the ETH misinformation as we await a decision on ETH ETPs. Ok\u2013let\u2019s talk about some basic facts about Ethereum. Millions of Americans hold ETH; it has been vital to crypto since its 2015 launch; and ETH is a commodity, not a security. 1/10 \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 20, 2024\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,507.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMarkets are seeing red early Tuesday morning as Bitcoin drops 7% and Ethereum lags 10%.\n\nThe global crypto market cap has contracted by 8% since yesterday, having dropped below $2.5 trillion after last week getting within 5% of matching its all-time high market capitalization crypto markets last saw in early November 2021.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $63,142.39 after having briefly dropped below the $63,000 mark, according to CoinGecko data. It's been a rapid change of scenery for Bitcoin traders. BTC set a new all-time high by inching above $73,000 last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum has fared even worse than Bitcoin.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the Ethereum price was $3,230.05. That's a 10% drop since yesterday and 20% lower than it was this time last week, when the Ethereum community was ramping up for the Dencun upgrade to go live on mainnet.\n\nThe stark Bitcoin and Ethereum price drops mean that a lot of long positions opened by optimistic traders have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass. In the past day, more than $500 million worth of long and $100 million worth of short positions have been liquidated across digital asset contracts.\n\nWhen a trader opens a long position, it's essentially bet that an asset will increase in price by a certain date. Ideally for investors, they only sell the asset once they've realized some gains and want to take profit. But in extreme cases, an exchange or brokerage can force a trader to liquidate because the asset has seen a big drop in price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, many of the meme coins that were stealing the show a few weeks back have seen even larger losses. That's usually the case for meme coins. When the market's largest assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum see price movement, memes can especially volatile and see outsized gains and losses.\n\nSolana meme coins Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk (BONK) have dropped 22% and 19% respectively in the past day. And Floki Inu (FLOKI), one of their Ethereum-based Shiba Inu-themed meme coin competitors, has shed 20% since yesterday.\n\nEven Jupiter, the Solana DEX that yesterday pledged to help out the Slerf presale buyers who just lost $10 million, has seen its JUP token drop 16% since this time on Monday."

        "title": "Crypto wallet providers urged to rethink security as criminals drain them of millions - The Register",
        "content": "Infosec researchers are noting rising cryptocurrency attacks and have encouraged wallet security providers to up their collective game.\n\nCheck Point specifically cites the growth of attacks that abuse Ethereum's CREATE2 opcode, dubbing it a \"critical issue in the blockchain community\" that's seeing millions of dollars worth of assets being drained from victims' wallets.\n\nIntroduced in 2019, CREATE2 is seen as a significant advancement for Ethereum, allowing for more efficient deployments of smart contracts \u2013 the technology that validates transactions on the blockchain.\n\nCREATE2 is also the function that's being exploited by attackers to drain tokens from victims' wallets.\n\nOne of its key capabilities is being able to deploy smart contracts to pre-determined addresses, making the entire process more predictable for the blockchain when dealing with multiple contract interactions across the ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nBy pre-determined, it means that an attacker can create temporary, single-use addresses to receive a victim's assets. New addresses can be used for each attack, and this is crucial because wallet security providers rely on previously held data to flag potentially malicious transactions. If the address has no dodgy history, it's likely the transaction will evade these detections.\n\nThe fact that attackers can set up a contract before deploying it (before it even exists), using a wallet address that doesn't have a history of malicious activity, means that if they can get the victim to approve a contract they can drain their funds.\n\nOf course, this requires some social engineering hijinkery to pull off, but we've all heard about the real-life scam stories that sound too wild to be true, but are. This attack works, and has facilitated huge single-transaction scams in recent times.\n\nThe researchers highlighted one fraud in January that saw attackers make off with $3.6 million worth of SuperVerse tokens in one fell swoop as an example of how serious these incidents can be for victims.\n\nRemember: with blockchains, there is no legal recourse and no customer helpline to recover funds. Once they're sent and signed, that's it \u2013 tokens are gone for good.\n\nHow they work and why they work\n\nThe attack flow is as follows. First, an attacker needs to get a victim to approve a contract that hasn't yet been deployed \u2013 the bit that requires social engineering. They then use CREATE2's ability to generate new contract addresses to receive the funds and deploy the malicious contract, complete with the victim's authorization, in turn draining the victim's wallet.\n\nThe key part here is the generation of a new wallet address, one that has no history of being reported for criminal intentions. CREATE2 generates this using a calculation that includes four parameters: the attacker's wallet address, a constant prefix, a salt, and an initialization code.\n\nThis address will be created only when the victim approves the contract, meaning it's never been used before for any illicit dealings, and won't be used again, thereby bypassing the security protections that usually monitor such transactions.\n\n\"The exploitation of the CREATE2 function underscores the continuous battle between innovation and security in the blockchain sphere,\" said Check Point researchers Oded Vanunu, Dikla Barda, and Roman Zaikin.\n\n\"As Ethereum continues to evolve, so too must the security mechanisms designed to protect users from such sophisticated attacks. Awareness and education are the first steps in safeguarding digital assets against emerging threats. Blockchain developers and users alike must remain vigilant, continuously updating their knowledge and security practices to navigate this ever-changing landscape securely.\n\n\"This vulnerability highlights the need for enhanced security measures in wallet security products to adapt to the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, ensuring the safekeeping of digital assets in the face of innovative exploits.\"\n\nThe big business of crypto attacks\n\nTowards the back end of 2023, we saw a string of high-profile wallet-draining attacks netting cybercriminals hefty sums, and the attacks weren't localized to just the Ethereum blockchain either.\n\nJustin Sun, founder of the Tron Foundation and owner of Poloniex, a crypto exchange that was drained of circa $120 million in November, offered a reward for the attackers at the time to return the funds they stole.\n\nThe Monero Project was also mysteriously drained of nearly half a million dollars just days before, and 5,000 Atomic Wallet users were drained earlier in the year \u2013 just a few of the high-profile incidents that took place in 2023.\n\nWhile not all of these have been directly attributed to CREATE2 exploits, researchers told The Register that it seems like North Korea's state-sponsored Lazarus gang may have been behind a sizable proportion of them.\n\nThe web3 anti-scam solution provider ScamSniffer analyzed a series of CREATE2 incidents between May and November 2023, concluding that almost $60 million had been stolen from around 99,000 victims. \u00ae"

The Ethereum address hosting it had its first transfer around two weeks ago, according to Etherscan. It contains 100 BUIDL tokens and has one holder.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s real-world asset (RWA) tokenization partner, Securitize, is already working with KKR, Hamilton Lane, and others on tokenized funds, reported Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, the new product is only available to institutional investors, with the minimum investment accepted set at $100,000.\n\nRWA tokenization is a process of putting traditional assets such as gold, commodities, treasuries, and real estate on the blockchain. It has been predicted to become a multi-trillion-dollar industry over the next decade, and Wall Street wants in on the action.\n\nBig banks such as JPMorgan, Citi, and Bank of America are all experimenting with RWA tokenization.\n\nPrivate wealth management firm Bernstein has estimated that around 2% of the global money supply, roughly $3 trillion, could be tokenized on the blockchain over the next five years. Additionally, Citigroup has estimated the tokenization market could swell to $5 trillion by 2030.\n\nETH Price in Retreat\n\nMoreover, the news of the fund comes amid hopes that a spot Ethereum ETF may be approved by the SEC in May. However, analysts have been lowering their odds of approval since the regulator has disengaged from fund issuers, and staking complications could arise.\n\nBlackRock is among the fund managers that have applied for a spot ETH ETF following the approval and success of its Bitcoin product.\n\nEthereum prices did not react to the news and retreated a further 5.8% on the day, falling to $3,150 during early Asian trading on Wednesday.\n\nETH had recovered marginally to trade just above $3,200 at the time of writing, but the crypto correction looks set to deepen.\n\nEthereum has fallen 21% from its 2024 high of $4,070 on March 12 and remains 34% down from its peak price in late 2021."

        "content": "The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem found itself on shaky ground as liquidations soared. In the last 24 hours, the DeFi ecosystem witnessed more than $5.4 million in collateral liquidations of which Ethereum (ETH) held a massive share. This comes amid the Ethereum price drop to $3,200 after it neared rhe $4,100 mark earlier this month.\n\nEthereum Price Drop Risks Massive Collateral Liquidation\n\nThe DeFi sector witnessed $4.27 million collateral liquidations tied to Ethereum alone, according to Parsec data. Moreover, amid the Ethereum price volatility, the data suggest massive collateral liquidations if ETH nosedived to $3,008. At this level, an enormous $24 million worth of ETH in collateral would be liquidated.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, on-chain derivatives exchanges, including GMX, Kwenta, and Polynomial, have collectively triggered liquidations surpassing a staggering $52 million in the same period. As Ethereum\u2019s price dipped to $3,200 from its recent $4,100 peak, short traders realized their profits by buying back their positions.\n\nHowever, long position holders indulged into panic selling to minimize their losses from the recent ETH price crash. According to Coinglass, Ethereum registered $120.27 million liquidations in the last 24 hours of which a staggering $103.54 million was liquidated by long players.\n\nWhilst, short traders accounted for $16.73 million liquidations. The significant long liquidations could lead to a further ETH price slump. In addition, the heightened Ethereum collateral liquidations could add to the bearish turn. Furthermore, Ethereum open interest fell 3.49% to $12.52 billion as derivatives traders pulled their money out.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum (ETH) Price Reversal Unlikely Soon As Majority Holders Still In Profit\n\nETH Price Plunges 9%\n\nThe Ethereum price crash over 9% today amid increased sell pressure.

Whilst, the crypto boasted a market cap of $387.84 billion.\n\nOn the contrary, the ETH 24-hour trade volume spiked 64.25% to $28.97 billion owing to the recent liquidations and whale selloffs. Earlier this month, the Ethereum price peaked at $4,092.28 but couldn\u2019t surpass $4,100 owing to the recent bearish turn.\n\nMoreover, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday, March 20, has spurred volatility in the crypto market.

        "title": "Ethereum price prediction and strategy for a $4K comeback - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "A close above $3,700 could help the price back to $4,000.\n\nThe Pi Cycle Top indicator revealed that the ETH might rally.\n\nEthereum [ETH] seemed to have become a shadow of its former self after the price collapsed from $3,633 to $3,22o in the last 24 hours.\n\nDespite the decline, AMBCrypto agrees that the value of the altcoin might retest $4,000. However, this prediction might not come cheap or easy.\n\nThis is because of the number of addresses that accumulated ETH around $3,700. This has made it a key resistance zone.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, ETH\u2019s previous rise above $4,000 placed 89% of its holders in profit.\n\nWho decided what\u2019s next?\n\nHowever, the recent decline meant that there was a sell wall at $3,700 where 991,000 ETH addresses purchased 4.35 million coins.\n\nWith ETH trading below the region, the holders have an opportunity to break even if the price climbs.\n\nIf the participants decide to book profits, the altcoin might find it challenging to revisit the psychological $4,000 mark.\n\nOn the other hand, if buying pressure outweighs the on-chain sell volume, then ETH might cruise above $3,700.\n\nBut whether the cryptocurrency would continue to languish in the red does not depend on the on-chain outlook alone.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto gauged the price action from a technical perspective. According to the 4-hour ETH/USD chart, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) depicted a short-term bearish trend for the altcoin.\n\nAt press time, the 20 EMA (blue) crossed below the 50 EMA (yellow). With this trend, the price of the cryptocurrency might drop by another 7.30%. Should this happen, the value could hit $3,112.\n\nA look at the Aroon Indicator also reinforced the bearish bias. As of this writing, the Aroon Down (blue) was 100% while the Aroon Up (orange) was 35.71%. This indicates that sellers were in control of the price action.\n\nETH is oversold\n\nFurthermore, an assessment of the Supertrend indicated that ETH has not yet flashed a buy signal. But there was an earlier sell signal at $3,780.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in the oversold region. If the reading continues to decrease, then the chances of a harder bounce might also increase.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, ETH might climb to $4,500 when the market turbulence fizzles.\n\nWhile the short-term outlook looked gloomy for ETH, the Pi Cycle Top indicated otherwise for the mid to long-term.\n\nHistorically, the indicator tells when a cryptocurrency is close to the bottom or has hit the market top.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nIf the 111-day moving average (MA), in green hits the same region as the 350-day MA (purple), then Ethereum would have hit the top of this cycle.\n\nBut that was not the case, as the 111-day MA was lower than its opposite number. Thus, the price of ETH might have a lot of upside potential over the forthcoming months."

        "content": "KangaMoon (KANG): A promising Ethereum-based Meme Coin reinvigorates the Play-to-Earn landscape\n\nPolkadot (DOT) price outperforms expectations, attracting Institutional Interest\n\nEthereum Token (ETH): Poised for $5,000 or Headed for a correction?\n\nDisclaimer: The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, expressed or implied, relating to the same.

Please take all steps necessary to ascertain that any information and content provided is correct, updated and verified.\n\nThe recent market surge has propelled numerous tokens to new heights in a remarkably short period. This resurgence of the bull market appears to be stronger than previous cycles. In this article, we will delve into the performance of top crypto coins like Ethereum (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), and a new market entrant, KangaMoon (KANG). KangaMoon is particularly witnessing an impressive growth during its ongoing presale phase, experiencing a surge of 125% in value to position itself among the top meme coins to invest in.Based on Ethereum Network, KangaMoon (KANG) is generating significant buzz within the cryptocurrency community during its ongoing presale. Having already surpassed the $1.6M funding milestone, KangaMoon is poised to tick the next $2M milestone before the end of March. This robust presale performance, however, underscores KangaMoon's potential to disrupt the meme coin market as well as capture the attention of crypto and meme coin enthusiasts worldwide.KangaMoon places a strong emphasis on building a vibrant community and fostering creativity. Their platform is designed to empower users, allowing them to participate in exciting battle contests and unleash their imagination by designing unique in-game characters.Setting itself apart in the meme coin market, KangaMoon seamlessly combines elements of Social-Fi and GameFi's Play-to-Earn (P2E) dynamics within a unified ecosystem. The platform's reward system is designed to incentivize active participation across various activities. Users not only earn rewards for playing games but also for completing challenges and engaging on KangaMoon\u2019s social media platforms.During its presale phase, KangaMoon has already demonstrated impressive growth, with its value surging by 125% from $0.005 to $0.01125. At this rate, analysts are optimistic about its future prospects, anticipating further upward momentum. With the potential to reach $1 by Q2 2024, KangaMoon is expected to gain wider traction, especially upon its listing on major Tier-1 cryptocurrency exchanges.Surpassing the performance of established cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Cardano, Polkadot (DOT) has demonstrated impressive returns recently. Its performance since the beginning of the month not only surpasses these well-known cryptocurrencies but also signals growing institutional interest beyond them. The lower price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of Polkadot serves as a value indicator, suggesting that Polkadot may be undervalued, potentially attracting the attention of institutions seeking untapped opportunities.Furthermore, Polkadot's recent price movements have generated a bullish sentiment, indicating a reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. With the completion of this bullish formation, the price of Polkadot has already achieved half of the anticipated 31.3% growth, approaching the expected target price of $12. However, the future growth of Polkadot hinges significantly on consistent market support and the ability to surpass the critical $11 level.Ethereum (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, has been holding steady above $4,000, fueling speculation of a potential rally to a new all-time high of $5,000. After an impressive 51% surge in February, Ethereum bulls carried their momentum into March. On March 8th, Ethereum triumphantly surpassed the $4,000 resistance level for the first time in three years, marking a significant 20% increase within the first week.As anticipated, this surge triggered a short-lived sell-off, leading to a 3% retracement that brought the price down to around $3,900 within the next 24 hours. However, over the past week, Ethereum continues to trade at a weekly price range of $3,828 - $4,049. Despite the price pullback, a majority of current Ethereum holders appear to be maintaining a bullish stance, suggesting continued confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term potential.Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!Website: https://KangaMoon.com/ Join the Telegram Community: https://t.me/KangaMoonofficial"

        "content": "The serial delay of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on spot Ethereum ETF has done little to deter Fidelity Investments as the firm just added the Staking option to its filing.\n\nFidelity To Add Staking to Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nIn November 2023, the American investment management firm applied to list its Ethereum spot ETF product with the SEC. This made it the 7th firm in the U.S. to gravitate towards the product after the likes of BlackRock, Hashdex, Invesco, and Grayscale Investments.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe spot Ethereum ETF, if approved, will trade in compliance with the BZX Rule.\n\nOrdinarily, the SEC is expected to decide on the rule change within 45 days of its publication for public comment. However, the decision from the agency did not come as expected even after the request for public comment was made in the first week of December. Rather the SEC announced a 45-day extension, pushing its decision on the Fidelity spot Ethereum ETF to March 5.\n\nFIDELITY ADDS STAKING TO THEIR ETH ETF APPLICATION IN AMENDMENT Source: DB | Coins: ETH \u2014 db (@tier10k) March 18, 2024\n\nIt is already way past the expected date and no decision has been made by the SEC on Fidelity\u2019s spot ETH ETF or that of any other applicant. As it continued waiting for the SEC, Fidelity decided to add staking for the cryptocurrency. Precisely, the asset management firm is looking to stake a portion of the fund\u2019s assets through one or more trusted staking providers.\n\n\u201cIn consideration for any staking activity in which the Fund may engage, the Fund would receive certain network rewards of ether tokens, which may be treated as income to the Fund as compensation for services provided,\u201d Fidelity stated in its amended spot Ethereum ETF filing.\n\nDeadline Fast Approaching\n\nIn the meantime, the duo Ark Invest and 21Shares are still anticipating a decision for their joint spot Ethereum ETF by May. Also, industry observers are closely watch the May 23 deadline for VanEck\u2019s filing, a make or mar point for the product.\n\nConsidering how much the regulator has consistently extended the date for its decision, it is not certain that the SEC will stick to the next deadline. Top industry players like JPMorgan already doubt the possibility of the SEC\u2019s May approval for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nStill, the recent move from Fidelity Investments to amend its filing suggests that these spot Ethereum ETF applicants are doing their best to keep hope alive.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, announced the launch of its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, marking a significant stride in bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, aims to provide qualified investors with US dollar yields through blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock Chooses Ethereum\n\nAccording to Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s Head of Digital Assets, the introduction of BUIDL is a continuation of the firm\u2019s commitment to innovation within the digital assets space. \u201cThis is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy,\u201d Mitchnick stated, highlighting the goal of developing solutions that address real-world client needs while expressing enthusiasm for the collaboration with Securitize.\n\nSecuritize is proud to announce we have partnered with @BlackRock. Together, we\u2019re launching BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). BUIDL will provide investors with the opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields by subscribing to the fund with Securitize\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nDsNehOXJU \u2014 Securitize (@Securitize) March 20, 2024\n\nTokenization is at the heart of BlackRock\u2019s digital asset strategy, with BUIDL enabling the issuance and trading of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach not only widens access to on-chain offerings but also ensures instantaneous and transparent settlement, along with interoperability across platforms, courtesy of BNY Mellon.\n\nCarlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, emphasized the transformative potential of tokenization in capital markets, noting, \u201cToday\u2019s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.\u201d\n\nBUIDL is designed to maintain a stable value of $1 per token, distributing daily accrued dividends directly to investors\u2019 wallets as new tokens each month. The fund primarily invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, ensuring a secure yield for token holders on the blockchain.\n\nMoreover, the ecosystem for BUIDL includes prestigious names like Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, setting a solid foundation for the fund\u2019s operations.\n\nThe strategic collaboration extends beyond product launch, with BlackRock making a strategic investment in Securitize and appointing Joseph Chalom, its Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, to Securitize\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nThis initiative represents a critical juncture in the evolution of digital assets, signaling the increasing integration of blockchain technology with traditional financial instruments. The fund\u2019s tokenized structure offers a glimpse into the future of investment, where accessibility, transparency, and efficiency reign supreme.\n\nEthereum Community Rejoices Euphorically\n\nReactions from the Ethereum community have been overwhelmingly positive, with industry figures like Anthony Sassano and Ryan Berckmans citing the launch as a bullish signal for both Ethereum and the broader crypto market.\n\nSassano, founder of the The Daily Gwei, remarked, \u201cBlackRock launching a yield-bearing stablecoin on Ethereum is still one of the most bullish things to ever happen in crypto and the market has definitely not digested this yet,\u201d underscoring the significant impact of such a move.\n\nRyan Berckmans stated, \u201cBUIDL seeks to offer a stable value of $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to investors\u2019 wallets as new tokens each month. I hadn\u2019t realized that BlackRock launched *a yield-bearing stablecoin* on ETH. Yield-bearing stables are apex products. Very bullish.\u201d\n\nSeraphim Czecker, head of growth at Ethena Labs added his excitement, stating, \u201cFreaking Blackrock launched a yield bearing stablecoin and you\u2019re not bullish on crypto. We have come a long way.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,549.\n\nFeatured image from DW, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Solana\u2019s recent performance has revived the old \u2018Ethereum-killer\u2019 debate again\n\nComparisons arose after SOL flipped BNB recently\n\nThe Ethereum vs Solana debate took a renewed twist in the third week of March after Solana hit crucial milestones.\n\nFor starters, Solana\u2019s [SOL] search interest on Google Trends surpassed Ethereum [ETH]. This indicates a spike in retail attention to SOL compared to ETH.\n\nAdditionally, SOL flipped BNB based on market cap and climbed into the top 3 in the DeFi ranking.\n\nCrypto influencer Anthony Pompliano recently interviewed Arthur Hayes, a serial investor, co-founder, and former CEO of BitMEX.\n\n\n\nHe asked for his thoughts on the ETH vs. SOL debate, and Hayes offered his candid opinion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything is going to be ETH.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, he added that Ethereum is the home of DeFi and hosts most of the first versions of dApps (decentralized applications) before they launch on other networks.\n\n\u201cIf you think of primitives of DeFi and dApps, the first version is always on Ethereum. It\u2019s not on Solana, AVAX, Cardano, or any other blockchains.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hayes highlighted why DeFi applications might migrate to other networks like Solana.\n\n\u201cMaybe there are reasons like network bloat, gas fees; then they move over to Solana or other chains.\u201d\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not seeing a new primitive emerge on a non-ETH chain first. If I start seeing that happen, I may have to change my mind on my maximalist position on ETH.\u201d\n\nSolana is great if you \u201cmissed\u201d discounted ETH\n\nInterestingly, Hayes confirmed that he trades most L1s but categorically highlighted Solana as a great opportunity for anyone who missed cheap ETH.\n\n\u201cSolana is a better version of ETH; I disagree, but that\u2019s what they believe. It could trade to $5K-$10K in this cycle. So buying it at $140 is a great asymmetric risk profile.\n\nAdditionally, he highlighted Solana\u2019s UX/UI as the best in the ecosystem and easy to use. Hayes believes these conditions could make Solana the best performer in this cycle.\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: SEC hits pause again, is a May launch possible? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "SEC\u2019s latest delay announcement has spurred some degree of skepticism\n\nExperts are now revising the odds of an Ethereum spot ETF being approved\n\nThe United States (US) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pushed back its verdict on the proposed Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by Hashdex and ARK 21Shares.\n\nThis delay, announced on the 19th of March, precedes the \u201cthird deadline\u201d set by the agency, with final determinations anticipated in late May. The announcement underscored that ARK 21Shares\u2019 decision is due by 24th May, with Hashdex\u2019s deadline set for 30th May.\n\nHowever, analysts harbor growing skepticism regarding the approval likelihood of the eight Ether ETF proposals, including those from BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity.\n\nEther ETF approval uncertainties\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart voiced apprehensions regarding the minimal interaction between the SEC and the applicants, raising uncertainties about the future of these ETFs.\n\nHe noted,\n\n\u201cMy cautiously optimistic attitude for ETH ETFs has changed from recent months. We now believe these will ultimately be denied May 23rd for this round.\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cThe SEC hasn\u2019t engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics. Exact opposite of #Bitcoin ETFs this fall.\u201d\n\nIn recent developments, Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg ETF, revised the chances of Ether ETF approval from 50% to 35% and noted,\n\n\u201cI get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time.\u201d\n\nThis highlights the sharp contrast between the Ether ETF and previous Bitcoin ETF approval processes, reflecting the SEC\u2019s minimal communication. Public sentiment mirrored this, with Polymarket odds for Ether ETF approval dropping from 77% in January to 32% by May.\n\nBitcoin ETF vs Ethereum ETF\n\nFurthermore, Grayscale is considering adding staking to its Ether ETF application, outlining proposals in a \u201cconsent solicitation statement\u201d to investors.\n\nThe statement highlighted,\n\n\u201cThis proposal will allow the Sponsor to cause the Trust [\u2026] to use, or permit to be used, any Ethereum held by the Trust in a proof-of-stake validation protocol in exchange for consideration of any kind for the ultimate benefit of ETHE shareholders.\u201d\n\nThis highlights that Grayscale aims to ease inflationary pressures through staking, pending shareholder approval. If approved, Grayscale would align with ARK 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity, who recently integrated Ether staking into their ETF applications.\n\nOverall, it would be interesting to observe the contrast as the SEC greenlighted ether futures-like ETFs but hasn\u2019t approved spot or mixed ether ETFs, unlike Bitcoin ETFs last fall."

        "content": "BlackRock chooses Ethereum for their tokenised investment fund\n\nTuesday was another record day for the Bitcoin ETFs. This time, it was a new record in terms of outflows, with $326 million leaving the Bitcoin invested funds. Not even BlackRock\u2019s IBIT could save the day with inflows of only $75 million. But, even with the market cratering, it wasn\u2019t all bad news. BlackRock\u2019s SEC filing of their USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund to invest in tokenised assets was a reminder how much more money can potentially flow into crypto.\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nTuesday was another record day for the Bitcoin ETFs. This time, it was a new record in terms of outflows, with $326 million leaving the Bitcoin invested funds. Not even BlackRock\u2019s IBIT could save the day with inflows of only $75 million. But, even with the market cratering, it wasn\u2019t all bad news. BlackRock\u2019s SEC filing of their USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund to invest in tokenised assets was a reminder how much more money can potentially flow into crypto.\n\nLarry Fink previously stated he saw value in an Ethereum ETF, but it will just be a \u201cstepping stone towards tokenisation.\u201d It seems like he truly meant it. Last Thursday, BlackRock submitted a filing to the SEC for their USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, called BUIDL. The fund will invest in tokenised assets on the Ethereum blockchain, using Securitize as their broker. Market participants discovered the fund\u2019s on-chain wallet has $100 million of USDC ready to invest. Since the wallet became public knowledge, it has received an assortment of tokens. The deposits are an interesting form of marketing, with all eyes watching the BUIDL wallet.\n\nThe creation of the fund is a big deal in further legitimising crypto as an asset class to invest in. Since the ETFs, Bitcoin is increasingly accepted as a store-of-value alternative to gold by traditional investors and as a first step into the crypto world. The next step would be to introduce investing in other \u201cLayer 1\u201d blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana. What BUIDL could potentially enable is step 3. This is investing in assets built on top of Layer 1s, with Ethereum being the obvious first choice.\n\nRight now, information on where exactly investments will go within the Ethereum ecosystem is not available. But, the fund has made it clear, BlackRock is betting on Ethereum, with the chain being able to cater to their tastes. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum has over 55% of the total value locked across all chains with nearly $50 billion. The vast majority of tokens with potential use cases are also launched on Ethereum with the Layer 1 having over 1,000. It is becoming more obvious that this will be the place institutions first dip their toes; either by investing in assets, or using DeFi applications.\n\nWith BlackRock\u2019s nearly perfect ETF approval record and the recent launch of BUIDL on Ethereum, is this an indication there is still hope for the ETF approval deadline in May? T-minus 63 days until we find out."

        "title": "What is EtherFi? A new approach to Ethereum staking - OKX",
        "content": "EtherFi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking platform that brings positive disruption to DeFi by allowing staking on Ethereum. The protocol offers a host of unique features, including its use of NFTs for validators and integration with EigenLayer for added yields.\n\nRead on to explore EtherFi in detail, including its key features, how it enhances decentralization for Ethereum, the project's roadmap, and more.\n\nTL;DR\n\nEtherFi disrupts DeFi by implementing non-custodial Ethereum staking, granting users full control.\n\nBy incorporating EigenLayer, the protocol increases rewards and boosts the value of DeFi by supporting simpler restaking.\n\nThe introduction of eETH, the project's native token, represents significant progress, streamlining the staking process through automatic restaking and various benefits.\n\nEtherFi's impressive $23 million Series A funding spotlights its fast expansion and strong investor support.\n\nEtherFi's roadmap outlines its future development, including achievements such as implementing DAO governance and improving the accessibility and security of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is EtherFi?\n\nEtherFi stands out in the DeFi space as a liquid staking platform on Ethereum. It introduces an innovative approach by allowing users to stake ETH and earn rewards, while emphasizing a non-custodial framework where users maintain control over their keys.\n\nOne of EtherFi's distinctive features is the development of a non-fungible token (NFT) for every validator participating in the staking procedure. This strengthens the safety and independence of stakers within the system.\n\nEtherFi's operations include integration with EigenLayer, which allows for additional yield earning on top of Ethereum's staking rewards. This integration allows users to engage in restaking without locking up their assets, providing flexibility to those interested in restaking.\n\nThe platform's native token, eETH, complements EtherFi's governance token by enabling users to directly manage the staking and restaking processes. The introduction of eETH has attracted considerable interest for the advancements it brings to the staking industry through its focus on the user, and its unique offerings. These include automatic restaking and the ability to earn rewards from EtherFi and EigenLayer. EtherFi's offering simplifies the staking process and enriches the user experience by offering additional incentives.\n\nEtherFi's robust growth is underscored by its recent $23 million Series A funding round, highlighting the confidence in and support for the project from leading crypto investors. EtherFi's success in liquid restaking has significantly impacted the DeFi scene, as demonstrated by its recent financial milestone. The platform's growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) and its increasing number of users demonstrate the effectiveness of its strategy and the rising desire for decentralized financial options that give users more control.\n\nHow does EtherFi enhance Ethereum's decentralization?\n\nEtherFi enables users to securely stake Ethereum through Operation Solo Staker, promoting a non-custodial approach. The operation allows anyone to run nodes via two 'paths'. Path 1 is permissionless, requires a 2 ETH bond to be put forward, and uses distributed validator technology (DVT) to allow stakers to validate and secure the blockchain. Path 2 sees stakers make a commitment to operate a node for two years and solo stake using DVT but without the need for a bond.\n\nBy making non-custodial staking easier for everyone, whether they're new to Ethereum or have been involved for a while, and dispersing network functions among numerous individuals without depending on intermediary institutions, EtherFi contributes to deeper decentralization for Ethereum.\n\nThe technical structure of EtherFi was specifically created to support a decentralized staking environment. Node operators can enter their public keys through smart contracts, and stakers can select operators to oversee validator nodes.\n\nAn auction system determines the allocation of staking opportunities to operators for greater fairness and transparency in network participation. Additionally, EtherFi offers unique features such as eETH, a liquid staking derivative token, and T-NFT and B-NFT tokens, which offer incentives and flexibility to stakers and node operators. EtherFi also introduces innovative features like eETH, a liquid staking derivative token, and T-NFT and B-NFT tokens, providing flexibility and incentives for stakers and node operators.\n\nApart from its technical achievements, EtherFi has promoted innovation and growth in Ethereum's ecosystem through its service layer, which provides a foundation for others to build out new services from. This not only encourages the creation of new applications and services but also provides a platform for growth and expansion within the Ethereum community.\n\nWhat are the key features of eETH in EtherFi?\n\nAmong its many features, EtherFi has attracted attention for its non-custodial nature, automatic restaking feature, and partnership with EigenLayer for additional rewards.\n\nAutomatic restaking\n\nThe eETH platform has implemented an automatic restaking feature that allows Ethereum staked on the platform to generate extra rewards. By integrating with EigenLayer, EtherFi allows users to validate various software modules beyond the base layer of Ethereum, increasing their potential earnings.\n\nT-NFT and B-NFT for enhanced security\n\nEtherFi's staking method stands out due to its implementation of T-NFT (transferable non-fungible token) and B-NFT (bound non-fungible token). These tokens serve as proof of ownership for staked ETH and play an important role in the safe exchange of validator keys with node operators. The B-NFT is specifically linked to the person holding the validator key, guaranteeing a strong level of security and responsibility.\n\nLiquidity pool and eETH mechanics\n\neETH functions as a rebasing ERC-20 token in a liquidity pool mechanism. This makes sure that an individual's eETH holdings will adjust proportionally to their share of EtherFi's overall Ethereum control. The protocol heavily depends on the liquidity pool, which enables issuing and burning of eETH and T-NFTs for delegated staking.\n\nPermissionless withdrawals and rewards\n\nEtherFi enables unrestricted withdrawals, providing the ability to skim partial rewards and fully unstake without relying on external authorization. This functionality is especially noteworthy in light of Ethereum's recent updates, which give stakers greater control over accessing their rewards and initial funds. This ability promotes fluidity and adaptability in the staking community.\n\nNon-custodial staking\n\nEtherFi empowers users by allowing them to maintain control of their keys. This helps users to stake with confidence as they have complete ownership and control of their assets without relying on outside parties. This method significantly decreases the risk of counterparty involvement with node operators and protocols.\n\nHow does EtherFi's eETH work with EigenLayer for additional yields?\n\nThe introduction of EtherFi's eETH has significantly progressed the liquid staking tokens (LSTs) field by providing a non-custodial staking option that seamlessly incorporates EigenLayer, resulting in improved yield possibilities. Here's how eETH functions within this system to generate extra yields.\n\nLiquid staking and restaking\n\nWith eETH, EtherFi users can stake Ethereum and get eETH tokens. These tokens can be automatically restaked on EigenLayer, allowing users to earn Ethereum staking rewards and additional yields without running their own node. This sets eETH apart from other LSTs, as it provides access to restaking yields through EigenLayer, increasing the potential earnings for its holders.\n\nIntegration with EigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer enhances the Ethereum staking layer's capabilities by applying actively validated service (AVS) modules to verify non-EVM code. This allows individuals with staking and LST holdings, including eETH, to generate extra income by validating applications and services outside of Ethereum's main functions.\n\nSecurity and control\n\nA key aspect of eETH is its focus on security and giving users control. EtherFi uses sharding in its technical design to guarantee that stakers maintain authority over their keys \u2014 a major deviation from the usual method of node operators generating the keys. This strategy reduces the chances of risk from other parties and reinforces the non-custodial aspect of eETH staking.\n\nRisks and considerations\n\nAlthough the combination of eETH and EigenLayer offers attractive returns, it's important to recognize the potential risks involved in staking. These include the possibility of flaws in smart contracts and the potential for penalties if an AVS operator misbehaves or validation is unsuccessful. EtherFi has pledged to apply protocol governance when deciding which services to back, to minimize these risks for its users.\n\nWhat is the EtherFi roadmap and its milestones?\n\nEtherFi's was launched to meet developers' needs for a secure, decentralized staking protocol that emphasizes user control and self-custody.\n\nImportant achievements include:\n\nEffectively implementing EtherFi's decentralized platform.\n\nEnabling individuals to stake their ETH in increments of 32 validators through trusted node operators.\n\nPartnering with Obol Labs to incorporate solo node operators.\n\nA significant milestone was the launch of eETH, EtherFi's liquid staking token, which allows for fully permissionless participation in Ethereum staking. The launch helped achieve two major objectives of the project: enhancing liquidity and improving accessibility in the DeFi space.\n\nThe EtherFi roadmap demonstrates the importance of open-source values to the project. EtherFi intends to release its software services and code to the public, promoting transparency while building trust within the community.\n\nEtherFi is also preparing to integrate DVT phase 2, which will create a completely automated process for individual staking and promote Ethereum's more decentralized staking environment. The plan includes implementing DAO governance and a token generation event to establish a collective governance structure that guarantees the protocol's sustainability and flexibility.\n\nThe final word\n\nEtherFi stands out in DeFi by offering non-custodial Ethereum staking, giving users control over their keys. Its integration with EigenLayer allows for extra yields through restaking, increasing its value in the DeFi space.\n\nEtherFi's liquid staking token, eETH, simplifies staking and provides rewards from both EtherFi and EigenLayer. A successful $23 million Series A funding round highlighted the platform's growth and showed strong investor confidence in the project's future.\n\nMany expect further developments for EtherFi, particularly as its roadmap emphasizes innovation, with stand-out milestones including the eETH launch, solo node operator integration, and plans for DAO governance. These developments all aim to make Ethereum staking more accessible and secure for a broader audience."

        "content": "Ethereum Foundation Faces Government Investigation; Fortune reports that the SEC is investigating ETH. After publishing this article, Fortune reported that the SEC is seeking to classify ETH as a security\n\nDisclaimer: The translations are mostly done through AI translator and might not be 100% accurate.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation - the Swiss non-profit organization at the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem - is facing questions from an unnamed \"government body\", according to the group's website GitHub.\n\nThe confidential investigation comes at a time of change in Ethereum technology and a possible upheaval for the underlying asset, ETH, which many US investment firms are looking to offer as an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is slowing their efforts despite recently approving a number of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe co-founder of the blockchain platform Ethereum is Vitalik Buterin and has the citizenship of Montenegro since April 2022. This information was communicated by tthe current Ministry of Finance and Social Welfare (MFSS), headed by current Prime Minister Milojko Spaji\u0107. It was then clarified that it was Butera's citizenship was granted in accordance with Article 12 of the Law on Montenegrin Citizenship.\n\nphoto: MFSS\n\nFollowing the publication of this article, Fortune reported that the SEC is seeking to classify ETH as a security, a move that would have major ramifications for Ethereum, the ETH ETF, and crypto in general. The financial regulator has sent investigative subpoenas to American companies over the past few weeks, Fortune reported.\n\nThe scope of the investigation and its focus were unknown until the article was published. A statement on GitHub dated February 26, 2024 said that \"we received a voluntary request from a government agency that included a request for confidentiality.\"\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPreviously, the Ethereum Foundation website contained the following announcement:\n\n\"The Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a manner that requires the contact not to be made public. Stiftung Ethereum will make public any type of investigation by government authorities that does not fall within the scope of regular business operations.\"\n\nThat post was removed from the site on February 26, along with the \"warrant canary\" tag.\n\nA warrant canary is usually some sort of text or visual mark (like a colorful bird, as was the case at the Ethereum Foundation) that individual companies place on their websites to indicate that they have never been served with secret government subpoenas or requests for documents.\n\nIf a government agency requests the information, the company can remove the text and thereby suggest that they have been served with the request without explicitly saying so.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation had previously mistakenly removed that tag in 2019, but quickly put it back on the site.\n\nA lawyer familiar with the situation said the Swiss regulatory agency may have served a document request on the Ethereum Foundation and may be cooperating with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"I also think we can say that the Ethereum Foundation is not the only entity that they are seeking information from,\" the lawyer told CoinDesk.\n\nThe SEC is evaluating multiple applications for the Ether ETF, but analysts following the process are growing less optimistic that the federal regulatory agency will approve any application, citing a lack of engagement between applicants and SEC officials.\n\n\"Every rumor about every activity\" that the SEC and their foreign counterparts are engaging in can be linked to the May 23 deadline facing the SEC,\" the lawyer said.\n\nBonus video:"
