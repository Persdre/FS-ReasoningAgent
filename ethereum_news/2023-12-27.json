        "title": "Three privacy-focused Ethereum L2s arising in 2024 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Several crypto startups are looking to develop the first-ever privacy-centric Ethereum L2.\n\nOn Ethereum today, transactions and other smart contract executions are all publicly visible. Transparency is a core principle of blockchain technology, meant to allow verification of systems and instill confidence, but it can also be a double-edged sword.\n\n\n\nWhile transparency ensures accountability, it also means that the details of these transactions and contracts are exposed to everyone, including malicious actors and hackers who can analyze transaction patterns, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract code, and exploit these weaknesses for nefarious purposes.\n\nPrivacy solutions offer dapp developers the opportunity to build applications that shore up these shortcomings without compromising security.\n\nIn the process, these privacy-first applications must endeavor to prevent harmful actors from concealing their identities, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. In short, to avoid the fate of crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which allegedly was used to launder over $455 million stolen by sanctioned North Korean hackers.\n\nRead More: Tornado Cash Developer\u2019s Arrest Sparks Protest in Amsterdam\n\nHere are a few teams that are hoping to build a functioning privacy-centric L2:\n\nAztec\n\nAztec is a privacy layer of Ethereum. It\u2019s referred to as a hybrid solution using zkSNARKs and its very own programming language, Noir, to offer private transfers, meaning that the network is designed to validate transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them, such as the amount and parties involved.\n\nUnlike other zero-knowledge (zk) rollups on Ethereum, Aztec combines private and public execution in one single zk rollup. Meaning that a user\u2019s own device is responsible for encrypting the transactions before it is processed by the blockchain.\n\nIts primary focus, for now, is to design a platform for engineers to write private smart contracts without requiring in-depth mathematical knowledge of zk proofs. It recently revealed a new testing environment, Aztec Sandbox, for interested developers and plans for a testnet launch early next year.\n\nFhenix\n\nEncryption start-up Fhenix hopes to bring fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to smart contracts.\n\nUnlike privacy startups that use zero-knowledge technology, where data must be moved off-chain and decrypted in order for a prover to verify its accuracy, FHE encryption performs computations directly on encrypted data.\n\nBy keeping data on chain, the network will have the capability to process computations that come from various sources, such as an on-chain poker game or a sealed-bid auction contract.\n\nFhenix launched a developer testnet in July and plans for a full-scale testnet launch of its FHE rollup in early 2024.\n\nCOTI\n\nCOTI is a privacy L2 building on Ethereum. Unlike Aztec, which uses zkSNARKS and Fhenix with FHE, COTI V2 will use so-called Garbled Circuits to enable private transactions.\n\nGarbled Circuits enable two different parties to evaluate information, even if they distrust one another. The parties can each submit their \u2018garbled\u2019 or encrypted inputs, computations are conducted on these inputs and an outcome is obtained.\n\nCOTI will launch a developer testnet V2 in Q2 of 2024, and its mainnet launch will come soon after.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum Gas Fee Concept Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Why Do We Need Gas in the Ethereum Ecosystem?\n\nGas\u2019s primary function is to reduce ETH\u2019s volatility. ETH is publicly tradeable and listed on exchanges. As a result, it is directly subject to market volatility. Petrol is not listed on any exchange, so it is not directly affected by market volatility. An Ethereum smart contract requires more computational power than a straightforward transfer. In order to avoid instability, the fee must be meticulously designed.\n\nHow Is the Gas Price Determined?\n\nGas price is determined by two factors: the gas limit and the price of gas. The sender\u2019s gas limit is the utmost amount of gas they are willing to pay for the transaction. The cost of gas is determined by market supply and demand. The final gas price for the transaction is calculated by multiplying the two prices.\n\nGas Limit * Gas Price = Gas Fee\n\nGas Limit: Gas Limit is the maximum quantity of ETH that the sender is willing to spend on the transaction. Typically, when discussing Gas in Ethereum, one is referring to Gas Limit. Sending ETH requires the shipper to set Gas Limit. If there is insufficient Gas Limit to complete the transfer, the transfer will be cancelled and the shipper will receive a Gas refund. Alternatively, if the sender specifies an excessive Gas Limit, any excess Gas will be returned to the sender.\n\nGas Price: Gas Price indicates the cost of Gas in Gwei. For instance, 1 Gas equals 10 Gwei. It is primarily determined by supply and demand in the market. Gas Price is multiplied by Gas Limit to ascertain the cost of gas.\n\nWhat Are the Factors Affecting Gas Fees?\n\nUnderstanding the dynamics of gas fees involves recognizing the factors that influence their fluctuations:\n\nNetwork Congestion: Ethereum\u2019s popularity has led to network congestion during peak usage times. As more transactions compete for limited block space, gas fees tend to increase.\n\nGas Price: Users can set their preferred gas price. A higher gas price increases the likelihood of a transaction being processed promptly, but it also incurs higher costs.\n\nTransaction Complexity: The computational resources required to execute a transaction or smart contract influence its gas fee. More complex operations demand more gas.\n\nGas Limit: Each Ethereum transaction has a gas limit, which represents the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend. If a transaction\u2019s computational requirements exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail, and the user will still be charged.\n\nExternal Events: Market fluctuations, platform upgrades, and major smart contract executions can impact gas fees.\n\nWhat Are the Strategies to Optimize Gas Fees?\n\nNavigating the Ethereum gas fee landscape requires a strategic approach. Consider these tips to optimize your transactions:\n\nGas Estimators: Various online tools and wallets provide gas estimators that recommend a suitable gas price based on network conditions. These estimators help you strike a balance between prompt execution and cost efficiency.\n\nOff-Peak Usage: Initiate transactions during periods of lower network activity. Gas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions: Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, aim to alleviate Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain and settling them on-chain. These solutions can significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times.\n\nBatch Transactions: Some wallets and platforms allow users to bundle multiple transactions into a single batch. This approach can save on gas costs, as multiple transactions are processed in a single block.\n\nGas Tokens: Gas tokens are tokens that can be minted when gas prices are low and burned (destroyed) when gas prices are high. This mechanism enables users to hedge against future gas price increases.\n\nSmart Contract Efficiency: Developers can optimize smart contracts to minimize gas consumption. This includes techniques like reducing unnecessary storage operations and using more efficient algorithms.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum gas fees are an integral aspect of the network\u2019s functionality. While they can present challenges, they are also a testament to Ethereum\u2019s popularity and utility. By understanding the factors that influence gas fees and implementing optimization strategies, users can navigate the Ethereum ecosystem more effectively and make the most of its innovative applications."

        "title": "Buterin proposes 'security through simplicity' to lighten Ethereum staking - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The proposal aims to balance the network's decentralization and scalability.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a new proposal that seeks to reduce the required number of signatures from validators to streamline the Ethereum network\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nAccording to Buterin, the proposal aims to make Ethereum\u2019s consensus implementation \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter\u201d by reducing the signature requirement per slot from roughly 28,000 to just 8,192 signatures.\n\nTo date, Ethereum has roughly 895,000 validators, with each validator being required to stake 32 ether (ETH) and become activated within the network. Ethereum does this to maintain decentralization and open access for more participants to help with staking, but this also results in more load on the network because of processing requirements.\n\n\u201cThe signature aggregation system feels reasonable at first glance, but in reality it creates systemic complexity that bleeds out all over the place,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nWith Buterin\u2019s proposal, the signature load for future upgrades would be predictable and limited, simplifying protocol and infrastructure development efforts. However, this also means that Ethereum\u2019s network load could still be increased through hard forks.\n\nButerin points out that such a system opens up compromises, limiting quantum security, complicated upgrades, and an apparent reliance on zero-knowledge proofs to manage scale.\n\nButerin believes that his proposal will simplify the proof-of-stake design and allow for a \u201clarge amount of technical simplification.\u201d\n\n\u201c[\u2026] instead of relying on cryptographers to create magic bullets (or magic bulletproofs) to make an ever-increasing number of signatures per slot possible, I propose that we make a philosophical pivot: move away from having such an expectation in the first place,\u201d the Ethereum co-founder stated.\n\nThe proposal provides three approaches to enable the reduction of required signatures: a shift to prioritizing reliance on decentralized staking pools, a two-tier system that provides options for \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking, and rotating validator subsets through committees.\n\nThe first approach suggests that Ethereum could discard direct access to the consensus layer in favor of using decentralized staking pools exclusively, raising deposit minimums but capping pool-related penalties to avoid over-reliance on operators.\n\nIn the second method, a two-tiered approach creates heavy-stake validators specifically assigned to finalize blocks. This is then supplemented by a lighter security layer that has no minimum thresholds to participate.\n\nThe third approach proposes a set construction that is proportional to a validator\u2019s stake weight and rotates participants dynamically.\n\nButerin notes that the third approach effectively decouples weight for incentive purposes (validator rewards) from stake weight for consensus purposes. This means that each validator\u2019s reward within the committee (based on an agreed-upon rotation) should be the same, keeping average rewards proportional to the balance.\n\n\u201cThe future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown: it can be raised in the future through hard forks, but only when developers are confident that technology has improved enough to be able to handle a larger number of signatures-per-slot with the same level of ease,\u201d Buterin said.\n\nThe main tradeoff is between a significant reduction in validator participation per slot and increased technical feasibility and flexibility. The proposal aims to balance the network\u2019s decentralization and scalability, but its critics argue that the changes it carries may diverge from Ethereum\u2019s core philosophy.\n\nWhile the purpose of improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability with a leaner signature scheme may appear to be well-meaning, commentators on Vitalik\u2019s proposal have raised concerns about possible security flaws due to the reduced complexity, which may open new attack vectors if any of the three approaches are implemented. To this end, Buterin responded that streamlining the protocol design offers \u201csecurity through simplicity\u201d while enhancing the network\u2019s resilience against state-level attacks."

But those getting into the market now, with the asset trading over $2,000, are not going to make it big unless they have a lot to invest.\n\nThe big returns will be made trading Ethereum layer-2 assets, he said.\n\nEthereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think pic.twitter.com/00YCLPyGCl \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 25, 2023\n\nEthereum to $15,000\n\nLark highlighted a number of current and upcoming layer-2 listings, such as zkSync, Starknet, Linea, Scroll, Blast, Manta, and Celestia. \u201cNew listings can make money, especially in the short term,\u201d he said.\n\nNewly launched tokens often exhibit pump-and-dump patterns as airdrop hunters offload them quickly. However, there have been several that have begun up trending soon after when they get listed on larger exchanges.\n\nFor the Ethereum hodlers, things could still be good in 2024.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBlast, an upcoming Ethereum layer-2 scaling network from the creator of leading NFT marketplace Blur, has now pulled in more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of deposits from users vying to earn yield and points towards an upcoming token airdrop.\n\nSome $1.13 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been deposited into the Blast bridge as of this writing, according to both the official website and DeFiLlama, making it the 23rd largest protocol by total value locked according to the latter resource. Over 86,000 users have contributed funds thus far.\n\nAccording to Blast, users are earning about a 4% annual return on deposited Ethereum (ETH) and 5% on stablecoins. Furthermore, they\u2019re earning \u201cBlast Points,\u201d which will play into their respective share of the upcoming BLAST token airdrop.\n\nAccording to the Blast website, the airdrop is set for May 2024.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlast aims to make an impact in the crowded Ethereum scaling market\u2014which includes networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base\u2014by incentivizing users with both native yield on staked cryptocurrency along with a share of tokens via airdrops. Crypto protocols use airdrops to give out tokens to early users and contributors, typically aiding in decentralized governance as well.\n\nPulling in users with the allure of token rewards is the same strategy that worked wonders for Blur, which dethroned one-time leader OpenSea to become the leading NFT marketplace in February. Blur has airdropped more than $800 million worth of BLUR tokens to NFT traders in 2023 across two waves, based on the peak value of the token, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nBoth Blast and Blur were founded by Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre, and both were backed by prominent crypto venture capital firm Paradigm. However, Blast\u2019s rollout has been controversial\u2014even for its backers.\n\nUsers are depositing cryptocurrency into a bridge that does not currently connect to the actual Blast network that\u2019s in development, and funds cannot be withdrawn until February 2024. The overt emphasis on earning yield and rewards before the network is even live has apparently rubbed some crypto users the wrong way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late November, just days after Blast was revealed to the world, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson wrote that the firm believed that the \u201cannouncement crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast and Pacman did not respond to the comments. However, in advance of Robinson\u2019s tweet, Pacman wrote that Paradigm had not been involved in Blast\u2019s go-to-market rollout, and that the VC firm\u2014which co-led Blast\u2019s $20 million raise\u2014had already asked the Blast team to make some changes.\n\nHe added that Paradigm\u2019s suggestions were \u201cunder active consideration,\u201d but that it would ultimately be Blast\u2019s call.\n\nIn December, Robinson tweeted that Paradigm had worked with Blast to develop a \u201cnew time-locked upgrade system,\u201d which he said would \u201cset a better precedent for future projects who may try to emulate them.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "An Ethereum wallet thought to belong to former U.S. President Donald Trump recently moved millions in crypto earned from sales of non-fungible tokens, according to reports from Arkham Intelligence on Dec. 27.\n\nArkham noted that Trump\u2019s wallet began to send his ETH holdings to Coinbase three weeks ago and has moved 1,075 ETH, worth $2.4 million, to the exchange. Arkham added that Trump\u2019s wallet previously held $4 million at its peak.\n\nLive Arkham data shows that Trump currently holds $1.39 million of ETH. He additionally holds $644,000 in MATIC and small amounts of other cryptocurrency tokens for a total of $2.22 million. Arkham\u2019s data additionally indicates that the wallet did not initiate any transfers to exchanges before December.\n\nThough Arkham suggested that Trump is selling the recently transferred holdings, the attached transaction log only shows deposits to Coinbase. The log does not explicitly show that he has sold or converted the funds to another asset.\n\nFunds likely linked to NFT sales\n\nThe crypto wallet in question is believed to belong to Trump based on Arkham Intelligence\u2019s findings. Arkham asserted in August that the wallet belonged to Trump based on information in a financial statement released that month.\n\nForbes India separately reported on Trump\u2019s financial disclosure at the time. The wallet\u2019s balance appears to originate at least in part from Trump\u2019s NFT sales.\n\nSales of the Trump-themed NFTs are conducted through a firm called NFT International LLC. The company claims it does not operate under Trump. However, Trump has been highly involved in promoting the NFTs and has hosted various events for those who purchase the collectibles. He has seemingly collected royalties and revenue from the sales, as explained above.\n\nThe company has so far released three series of NFTs. The latest batch of NFTs attempted to capitalize on Trump\u2019s recent arrest by featuring his mugshot photo. High-quantity purchases included a physical card with pieces of Trump\u2019s suit.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin\u2019s new proposal would cut Ethereum\u2019s security - crypto.news",
        "content": "In a new controversial proposal, Vitalik Buterin suggests decreasing the number of PoS validators from nearly 1 million to just 8,192 to reduce complexity.\n\nIn a new proposal released on Dec. 27, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a plan to dramatically simplify Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) system to reduce complexity and expand the design possibilities.\n\nThe current PoS system attempts to support decentralization by allowing many validators \u2014 currently almost 900,000. However, Buterin argues that this creates significant complexity, sacrifices, and constraints while still not fully achieving the goal of accessibility for small-scale stakes due to the 32 ETH minimum requirement.\n\nInstead, Buterin proposes reducing the number of signatures per slot to just 8,192 from the current plan of over 1.7 million. This would enable major simplifications across Ethereum, make it much easier to transition to quantum resistance, and retain a cost for attacks between 1-2 million ETH \u2014 which Buterin suggested is high enough:\n\nEven a cost of attack of 1-2 million ETH should be totally sufficient. Vitalik Buterin\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin pitches 3 pathways to simplify Ethereum\u2019s PoS model\n\nDeveloper Micah Zoltu commented on the proposal, noting that this attack cost may be insufficient. According to him, numerous actors dispone this kind of resources and may turn against the protocol sooner or later:\n\nThere are many governments around the world who spend that much on one missile, or one plane. We should be designing systems resilient to state attackers who are willing to spend money to ruin your day. While 1-2 [million] ETH may be enough to deter them from attacking, we have evidence that they will spend far more than this to achieve their goals, and many governments do appear to be heading in the direction of \u201cdestroy crypto\u201d as one of their goals. Of course, I cannot say that 9 [million] ETH is enough either, or maybe both are in fact more than enough! However, I don\u2019t think it is as obvious as you imply that we can safely reduce the security budget. Lindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things, because everything will be fine right up until it isn\u2019t, then it is all very, very bad all of a sudden. Micah Zoltu\n\nThe last part of the statement refers to the Lindy Effect, the theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so things that have been around for a long time are more likely to stick around longer.\n\nIn this context, when Zoltu states, \u201cLindy doesn\u2019t apply to these things,\u201d he argues that just because Ethereum\u2019s high level of security has been sufficient so far, it doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily continue to be sufficient.\n\nButerin outlines three potential approaches to make this reduced signature scheme work: relying entirely on decentralized staking pools, using a two-tiered system with lighter and heavier staking requirements, or rotating participation across slots to retain accountability.\n\nThe proposal has garnered commentary from developers like Zoltu, who questioned whether the reduced 1-2 million ETH attack cost would be sufficient to deter state-level attackers. Buterin acknowledged this was a fair critique, and the optimal cost remains unclear.\n\nThe coming debate around this and other PoS proposals will likely be as vibrant as ever in the Ethereum community."

        "title": "ZkSync beats Ethereum in monthly transaction count despite Christmas outage - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum has been upstaged by one of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction count.\n\nZkSync\u2019s transaction spike has resulted in lower fees.\n\nDevelopment is positive step for Ethereum's scalability.\n\nEthereum has been knocked off its perch, at least when it comes to the monthly number of transactions.\n\nZkSync, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, has managed to process more transactions than Ethereum in the last 30 days, according to data from L2Beat, a portal that tracks data for such buzzy blockchains.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a feat because it is the first time Ethereum has been surpassed by any of its layer 2s in 30-day transaction numbers.\n\nEthereum layer 2 blockchains like zkSync help scale the blockchain with increased speed while relying on the mainnet\u2019s security.\n\n30-day transaction count for Ethereum and its layer-2s. Source: L2Beat\n\nIt\u2019s also significant that the transaction spike has not resulted in higher fees on zkSync. Instead, fees have dipped 44% within the same period, data from blockchain analytics portal growthepie shows.\n\nIt currently costs about $0.13 to use the network to send tokens while it is $2 on the Ethereum mainnet. More complicated transactions like token swaps cost even higher, as much as $35 as of the time of reporting.\n\nThis fee decline supports the expectation that zkSync should become cheaper to use as it scales.\n\nZkSync\u2019s run to the top of the ladder has come amid a boom in inscriptions on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nInscriptions are data files for applications like NFTs and meme coins embedded on blockchains in a way that is supposed to be cheaper than using smart contracts.\n\nThey first emerged on Bitcoin but have now become a trend on Ethereum-based blockchains.\n\nTotal investor deposits in zkSync, as measured by \"total value locked\"\n\nTransaction-spamming associated with the inscriptions trend has become a stress test for blockchains like zkSync and Arbitrum with the latter going offline on December 15.\n\nThe milestone also comes after zkSync had a minor hiccup on Christmas. Block production was paused amid a temporary network outage for the blockchain.\n\nThe developers behind zkSync said the problem was due to a bug in the chain\u2019s server and promised a full post-mortem of the incident. Some security researchers say the issue may have involved the blockchain\u2019s Sequencer.\n\nZkSync uses a Sequencer to verify, organise, and bundle transactions to Ethereum for finality. Layer 2 Sequencers have been prone to faults in the past with Arbitrum, a zkSync suffering a similar fate in June.\n\nApart from Inscriptions, zkSync\u2019s transaction count also has a prominent airdrop footprint. Matter Labs has been mum about the possibility of an airdrop, but that has not stopped DeFi users from piling into the chain in hopes of a potential airdrop win.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum price eyes $2,500 mark as Solana market takes a breather - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum price looks poised for a continuation of the uptrend, with several technical indicators favoring the upside.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana price is likely to face a correction after a multi-month period of SOL being massively overbought.\n\nETH could rise almost 7% to hit $2,500 amid rising momentum and a possible pending buy signal.\n\nA break and close below the critical support at $2,147 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price looks poised for a shine after a prolonged contention against its peer in the Layer 1 space, Solana (SOL). This brings to mind previous reports where Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he envisions a future where SOL and Ether co-exist, urging that the whole narrative of one ecosystem kills the other be binned.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto hack: Ethereum, Solana DeFi trading platform Thunder exploited for $239,000\n\nEther displays upside potential as Solana price shows weakness\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has spent the better part of December consolidating between the critical support at $ 2,147 and the $2,380 resistance level. Based on technicals such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the largest cryptocurrency may be poised to shine, at least for the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL market is exhibiting weakness, as the technical indicators hint at a possible dip in the Solana price. It comes after a prolonged period of SOL being massively overbought, indicated by the presence of the RSI above the 70 level since October 18, when the markets turned bullish. This preceded a correction.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nEthereum price outlook with ETH shining at Solana\u2019s expense\n\nAfter Solana price\u2019s epic surge across the fourth quarter, the SOL market is taking a breather, with capital flowing into Ether. With this, Ethereum price looks ready to shine at the expense of Solana.\n\nThe RSI is northbound, suggesting rising momentum. The Awesome Oscillators (AO) indicator remains in the positive territory, adding credence to the bullish thesis. Increased buying pressure above current levels, therefore, could see Ethereum price rise, potentially flipping the $2,380 resistance level to a support before testing the $2,403 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, the gains could extend for Ethereum price to tag the forecasted $2,500 psychological level, in a move that would constitute a 7% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the $2,380 roadblock holds as resistance, the ensuing rejection could see Ethereum price lose the critical support at $2,147, below which the bullish outlook would be invalidated. In the dire case, Ether market value could descend to test the supply barrier that now acts as a bullish breaker between $2,049 and $2,107.\n\nA break and close below the midline at $2,075 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, with Ethereum price likely to spiral towards the $2,049 support, levels last tested in November."

        "title": "What is a spot ETH ETF: how does a spot Ethereum ETF work? - OKX",
        "content": "Following the excitement of the 2024 arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs, we're seeing increased speculation about what crypto-themed exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be next. Chief among these rumors is how a spot Ether (ETH) ETF might be next given its popularity among institutions and retail traders. The crypto space didn't need to wait long for an answer.\n\nSpeculation around a possible spot ETH ETF rose towards mid-2024, with commentators debating the percentage likelihood that such a product would get the green light during the year. Optimism rose and fell, until a sudden acceleration in the process. The week of May 20, 2024 saw the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) request that all exchanges pursuing a Spot ETH ETF update their fillings immediately. Just days later on May 24, the commission approved key 19b-4 regulatory filings, clearing a path towards full approval. With the SEC's latest announcement to give spot ETH ETFs the go-ahead to start trading, all bets are off as we could possibly see another wave of mass adoption similar to the one witnessed with spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat does this all mean, and what happens next? From understanding what a spot ETF is to highlighting the pros and cons of trading a spot Ether ETF, here's everything you'll need to know when it comes to navigating the volatility surrounding the spot Ether ETF announcement.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nConceived in 2013, Ethereum is a popular decentralized blockchain platform with smart contract utility. It revolutionized the crypto world by introducing self-governing smart contracts, allowing users to create and execute automated agreements. Ethereum's ecosystem thrives on the Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency, which acts as a fee for transactions and powers a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps) like DeFi lending platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFT). These DApps operate without a central authority, opening up new possibilities across various fields.\n\nWhy is Ethereum so popular?\n\nAmong the various altcoins in the crypto space, Ethereum shines as a particularly captivating ecosystem for both retail and institutional crypto traders. Given its decade of growth and influence within the crypto space, Ethereum has certainly stood the test of time as it stands shoulders above other altcoins that were conceived in the early 2010s. As the first platform to pull off smart contracts without a hitch, Ethereum has achieved numerous feats that include introducing the first-ever NFT standard in 2018 and making a full transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (PoS) as part of the Ethereum Merge. These milestones combined with the fervent Ethereum community and extensive number of DApps in the Ethereum ecosystem make Ethereum a powerhouse in the crypto space.\n\nNow that we understand what Ethereum is and why it's so popular, let's dive into the fundamentals of a spot ETH ETF.\n\nWhat is a spot ETH ETF?\n\nAlso known as a physically-backed Ether ETF, the spot ETH ETF resembles traditional exchange-traded funds, where institutions managing the ETF commit to purchasing ETH and holding ETH in their reserves. The ETF is then listed on a traditional stock exchange and issues shares representing ownership of the ETF. This effectively means traders gain exposure to the underlying ETH held in the institution's reserves when trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nOne key thing to take note of when trading the spot ETH ETF is that owning shares of a spot ETH ETF doesn't directly grant ownership of individual ETH tokens held by the institution. Shareholders hold claims on the value of the ETH holdings, not the Ether itself. Additionally, while institutions hold the underlying ETH, they may use various strategies to manage it, such as lending it out or using it for staking, to potentially generate additional returns for the ETF.\n\nWho is the spot ETH ETF for?\n\nMany believe that the spot ETH ETF will be perfect for TradFi traders who are used to trading stocks and ETFs on traditional brokerages. While directly trading Ether has its charm, it's not for everyone given the inaccessibility and numerous barriers to entry that cryptocurrencies are known for. That's where spot ETH ETFs come in. As setting up wallets, navigating exchanges, and managing private keys can sometimes feel alien and complex, spot ETH ETFs will ease traders who are more familiar with TradFi in gaining exposure to ETH. By trading spot ETH ETFs, traders with little to no experience in crypto can gain convenient exposure to ETH's price movements without needing a cryptocurrency wallet or dealing with the intricacies of directly buying and storing ETH.\n\nHow does a spot ETH ETF work?\n\nConfused about how a spot ETH ETF works? Think of the spot ETH ETF as a pool where traders contribute funds to buy ETH. This pool then tracks the price of Ether by holding the coins directly. When the price of Ethereum rises, the value of the ETF shares goes up proportionally, and vice versa. This is distinct from ETH futures-based ETFs, which track ETH's price through derivatives like ETH futures without holding the underlying asset.\n\nTo keep pace with the constantly fluctuating price of ETH, the ETF manager works behind the scenes to monitor the market and adjust the ETF's ETH holdings as needed. This typically involves creation and redemption units, which are large blocks of shares exchanged for the underlying Ether. This delicate balancing act aims to ensure your ETF shares accurately reflect the real-time market value of Ethereum, though slight differences can occur due to factors like trading costs and rebalancing schedules.\n\nAdvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nLowering the barrier to entry to gaining crypto exposure\n\nAs mentioned above, crypto can be hard to get into because of the numerous points for potential friction that'll deter anyone new to crypto trading. This can range from fumbling during the Know Your Customer process to choosing the right spot pair to trade the crypto you want. With the spot ETH ETF, traders who already have trading accounts with established TradFi brokerages can simply look up the ticker for the spot ETH ETF and trade it as they normally would with any other forex pair or stock.\n\nBeing open to institutional traders\n\nWith a spot ETH ETF, trading ETH becomes even more accessible from an institutional perspective. As institutions like pension funds and asset managers may have specific regulations that prevent them from trading Ether and other coins directly, smart money has long been barred off from gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies. With a spot ETH ETF, they might have a better chance of being allowed to trade it as it's an SEC-approved trading vehicle.\n\nNew ways to trade ETH\n\nOn top of traders buying and selling shares of spot ETH ETFs, traders can also consider alternative methods of trading spot ETH ETF shares. This can range from short-selling it to the downside if they're intending to hedge their overall portfolio or are bearish about Ether to executing options strategies like covered calls to generate additional gains on their spot ETH ETF holdings. Such alternatives will inject a fresh amount of liquidity into the crypto market as more traders gain exposure to Ether through trading the spot ETH ETF.\n\nDisadvantages of trading spot ETH ETFs\n\nETF expense ratios\n\nFor those new to trading ETFs, one thing to take note of is expense ratios, which measures how much of a fund's assets are used for administrative and other operating expenses. While the exact ratio is yet to be known since the spot ETH ETF hasn't yet reached full approval at the time of writing, we can take Bitcoin futures ETFs for reference. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF has an expense ratio of 0.95%. This is considerably higher compared to other ETFs and mutual funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.03%. As this is an annualized fee that compounds over the length of time that traders hold the ETF, overall gains earned from trading the spot ETH ETF will definitely be impacted.\n\nETH ownership\n\nAs previously mentioned, share traders technically don't own the Ether since it's managed by the spot ETH ETF manager, who could potentially be lending out or staking the ETH for extra yield. This brings into question concerns of true ownership, since \"not your keys, not your coins\" is a mantra that many crypto natives swear by and could be a major concern if the ETF liquidates its assets and closes down the line. Judging by the recent amendment made by Fidelity's ETH ETF application, this might be the case should their version of spot ETH ETFs get approved.\n\nThe limitation of regular trading hours\n\nCrypto markets are famous for being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about spot ETH ETFs, whose shares are subject to the regular trading hours of when a typical stock market opens and closes. Due to this limitation, traders could potentially miss out on potential opportunities during times when the stock market is closed.\n\nWhen were spot ETH ETFs approved?\n\nThe flurry of activity during late May 2024 suggested earlier this year that a spot ETH ETF approval is imminent. This was hinted at by institutions like BlackRock and ARK Invest who officially filed for spot ETH ETF approvals.\n\nHowever, the investment management firms, alongside other applicants including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise, made amendments to their spot Ether ETF applications to remove plans for staking. The amendment was expected, as regulators may claim that staking blurs the lines between a digital asset and a security.\n\nOn Thursday 23 May, 2024, the SEC approved firms' 19b-4 regulatory filings following a remarkable turnaround for the spot ETH ETF's prospects. Although significant, this development is by no means the final hurdle. Next up, regulators must clear the S-1 filings made by prospective ETF issuers before the fund can be made available to traders. That process could take a further few weeks or months, with an exact timeframe not yet given.\n\nOfficial spot ETH ETF approval\n\nThankfully, the dust seems to have settled as 23 July, 2024 marks the official day when spot Ether ETFs go live for trading. The total list of spot ETH ETF issuers include BlackRock, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco. If you've previously traded spot Bitcoin ETFs, you'll likely find some of these names familiar. Planning to trade these spot ETH ETFs? One thing to note is that each issuer has its own set of related fees and fee waivers, so if you're intending to hold them for the long haul, it'd make sense to keep the fees in mind so they don't eat into your overall gains.\n\nLooking ahead, Standard Chartered has announced that a spot Ether ETF approval might send ETH prices rallying to $8,000 by the end of 2024 and skyrocketing to $14,000 by 2025. According to their analysts, this prediction comes in light of high-profile names like Fidelity and Blackrock that pursued spot Ether ETF approvals, and the Dencun upgrade that makes Ethereum transactions more affordable overall.\n\nShould you buy Ether instead?\n\nAlthough spot ETH ETF shares may offer convenience that's considered useful for traders, the truth is that owning spot ETH ETF shares differs greatly from owning Ether directly. That raises the question \u2014 why not just buy ETH itself? To dissect this question further, it's important to consider your priorities and goals as a trader. If you're a trader that's inexperienced with trading crypto and simply want exposure to Ethereum, trading spot ETH ETF shares may be perfect for you. However, if you're a trader that prioritizes ownership and freedom to trade at whatever timing, then the spot ETH ETF might not be suitable for you.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nSpot Ether ETFs offer a compelling bridge between the allure of Ethereum and the familiarity of TradFi. The availability of a spot Ether ETF as an option for traders represents a significant step forward in making Ethereum accessible to a wider audience. By simplifying access to crypto and allowing for diversification of trading portfolios, the spot ETH ETF opens the world of crypto to a whole new audience. Although trading shares of the spot ETH ETF comes with its own set of risks and disadvantages, it's undoubtedly popular among traders with specific trading preferences and could be the catalyst needed to create a spike in demand for crypto ETFs.\n\nKeen to give trading Ether directly a go?

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto YouTuber Lark Davis has taken to the Twitter/X social media network to share his view on the enormous all-time high he expects the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, to reach. He has not named any definitive time frames for this surge, though, and just stated that this is a questions of \u201cwhen, not if\u201d.\n\nDavis bets on Ethereum ultimately reaching a mind-blowing $10,000 price tag. To achieve that price milestone, Ethereum would have to showcase a whopping 321.52% from its current price level - $2,370.\n\nEthereum reaches new milestones\n\nAs reported by the popular on-chain data aggregator Santiment, Ethereum has been moving towards a new record recently, along with the flagship digital currency Bitcoin. Per recent tweet, Ethereum is now within 1.6% of the highest value since May 11 last year. As for Bitcoin, BTC is within 2.9% of the highest value since April 6 last year. Both highs were reached by these two largest cryptocurrencies at the start of December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, top 10 exchange wallets continue to move Ethereum, according to an earlier tweet published by Santiment as they are withdrawing their ETH into smaller blockchain addresses from centralized crypto exchanges or are moving Ethereum away from CEXs entirely. About two weeks ago, a massive 240,000 ETH was transferred from exchanges. This massive amount of ETH is evaluated at an impressive $569,347,200 at the time of this writing.\n\nGalaxy Digital dumps tonnes of Ethereum\n\nAs reported by U.Today, approximately a week ago, a major cryptocurrency market player, Galaxy Digital investment fund created and spearheaded by former Goldman Sachs partner Mike Novogratz transferred 11,200 Ethereum to the Binance exchange with an apparent goal to sell it. At that time, this ETH lump was worth roughly $24.3 million.\n\nHowever, it was not the only Ethereum transfer made by Novogratz\u2019s company recently. Blockchain sleuth @OnchainDataNerd stated that until that day, Galaxy Digital had deposited 31,437 ETH in total to various cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nMike Novogratz himself is an early Ethereum investor. In one of his interviews, Novogratz stated that he had bought 500,000 ETH from Vitalik Buterin right after the ICO, before Ether began trading on exchanges and was worth less than $1. He was the first even Wall Street buyer of Ethereum back then."

        "content": "The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism at the core of Ethereum, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, may face systemic complexity. To address this, he has three solutions.\n\n\u201cA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe primary problem is that to keep the network functioning properly, validators that maintain it must create a large number of digital signatures using encryption.\n\nThe network already has a lot of work to handle from this, but as additional validators join, the number of signatures will rise, adding to the system\u2019s workload. Subsequent updates are expected to raise the required signatures even more dramatically.\n\nOn December 27, Buterin wrote a post to the Ethereum Research forum outlining three approaches to avoid this. The shared goal is to reduce the number of signatures needed for each Ethereum blockchain space to 8,192.\n\nThe first solution is centered on decentralized staking pools. This would need raising the minimum amount of ether needed to run a validator to force people running validators to collaborate and pool their resources.\n\nVitalik\u2019s second solution is to have two layers of stakeholders, one with stricter criteria and the other with more lax ones would be the second strategy. During the block finalization process, the two levels would be used in distinct ways.\n\nThe third option would be to have a rotating group of participants, in which case a different group of validators is chosen at random for each slot. Although Buterin pointed out that it would increase complexity, this would divide out the workload and lower the overall number of signatures."

Why is everyone so hell-bent on calling tops? What the f**k is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nJust buy dips all the way to $400.\n\nNot a single person is ever going to remember the guy who may or may not have been successful in shorting a 10% move down, but they will remember the chads who long all the way to inevitable all-time highs.\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it, SOL is this cycle\u2019s darling chain, embrace it.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is worth $112, up more than 1,000% from this year\u2019s opening price of $9.99.\n\nLooking at the low time frame charts of Solana, the trader thinks that the altcoin is poised for another leg up against both the US dollar and Bitcoin (SOL/BTC).\n\n\u201cNice little 12% dip there on SOL in a monster uptrend with a few more legs to go in my opinion on the BTC pair and USD pair. Don\u2019t fight the trend.\u201d\n\nBluntz uses the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis in an attempt to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave uptrend to be followed by an ABC correction before the next leg up.\n\nLooking at the analyst\u2019s SOL/USD pair, he seems to suggest that the pair is in a position to rally once more after completing an ABC correction. For the SOL/BTC pair, he appears to predict that it could rise above 0.0034 BTC, worth $144.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to him, Solana is Ethereum. This intriguing vision paves the way for crypto interoperability.\n\nSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum \u2014 toly \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@aeyakovenko) December 26, 2023 Anatoly Yakovenko is convinced: Solana is Ethereum\n\n\u201cSolana is Ethereum\u201d: What Does the Founder of the SOL Blockchain Mean?\n\nCrypto analysts have always considered Solana as the \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d. But recent statements by Yakovenko are changing the narrative.\n\nIn a recent post on his X account, Yakovenko is expanding the horizon of the crypto blockchain by suggesting that Solana can be more than a mere competitor to Ethereum. Specifically, the co-founder of the SOL crypto platform explores the notion of Solana as a layer 2 for Ethereum.\n\nIn his comments on platform X, Yakovenko explains that this symbiosis is possible through the \u201cnative wormhole layer.\u201d Danksharding, Ethereum\u2019s scalability upgrade, then becomes the key to this collaboration. It will improve scalability, thereby paving the way for unexpected cooperation between two crypto blockchain giants.\n\nDanksharding: The Path to Crypto Interoperability\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, Danksharding appears to be the key that unlocks the potential for interoperability between the two crypto platforms. He maintains that the extension of danksharding will facilitate the integration of SOL blocks within a validation relay contract on the Ethereum crypto blockchain. This underscores a collaborative approach to bridging protocol and consensus differences.\n\nThe different consensus mechanisms between Solana and Ethereum raise questions about the stability of this crypto alliance. Some users wonder about the possible reorganization of Solana as a layer 2 if Ethereum adopts a different approach. In this regard, Yakovenko assures that users can withdraw their crypto ETH tokens from the bridge. The agreement from both sides remains essential, however.\n\nHowever, he acknowledges that mutual agreement is necessary for seamless integration. He thus highlights the challenges that remain despite the innovative vision of crypto interoperability between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nYakovenko\u2019s bold statement marks a turning point in Solana\u2019s perception towards Ethereum. This exploration of crypto interoperability, fueled by Danksharding, promises a collaborative future in the complex universe of blockchain.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH) has managed to sustain above the $2150 level. This level coincides closely with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall trend of this asset remains bullish. With an intraday gain of 5.3%, the ETH price has just offered a breakout above the resistance trendline which traced the correction trend indicating an early signal of uptrend continuation.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Ain\u2019t Dead: Here\u2019s Why Ethereum Can Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nadvertisement\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Surpass $2500\n\nThe ETH price breakout from the overhead trendline should release the build-up momentum\n\nThe coin buyers may face potential supply pressure at $2400, followed by $2665\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $12.8 Billion, indicating a 30% gain.\n\nAfter witnessing steady growth from mid-October to early December, the Ethereum price shifted its projection sideways in line with the current market uncertainty. This last three weeks\u2019 consolidation gives a view of price sustainability at higher levels and a short breather per buyers to recuperate the rest of the time.\n\nInterestingly, the ETH price was actively rebounding from two converging trendlines which acted as a dynamic resistance and support. Today, the Ethereum price witnessed a significant inflow, which led to a decisive breakout from the upper trendline in the 4-hour time frame chart.\n\nShould this candle close above the breached level, the buyers would obtain an early signal of uptrend continuation. With sustained buying the ETH price should surpass the last swing high resistance of $2400 to obtain a better confirmation and entry opportunity.\n\nAs per the Fibonacci extension tool, the post-correction rally can chase a potential target of $2665 aligned with the 0.618 FIB level\n\nKey Level to Watch\n\nWhile the current market outlook for Ethereum seems strongly bullish, the coin buyers may face renewed supply pressure at the $2400 mark. In case this resistance triggers another correction, the coin holders can rely on an ascending trendline that has been offering dynamic support to the ETH price for nearly two months. The coin price rebounded several times from the support project the buyers continued to accumulate at market dips, which is a strong signal of an established uptrend.

        "title": "L'innovazione di Ethereum: le migliorie alla proof of stake - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, with Ethereum (ETH) standing out as a pioneer in the field of proof of stake.\n\nRecently, ETH has recorded an increase of 6.77%, a positive signal for investors and industry enthusiasts.\n\nThis development can largely be attributed to the proposal by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, to simplify the proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism of the platform.\n\nThe problem of complexity in Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake\n\nThe heart of the matter lies in the intrinsic systemic complexity of Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. Buterin has identified a critical node: the management of digital signatures. Validators, responsible for the network\u2019s operation, must produce a high number of digital signatures.\n\nThis process, already burdensome, becomes even more burdensome with the increase of validators, leading to system overload.\n\nFuture implementations could even further intensify the signing requirements. The challenge is therefore not only to maintain, but also to optimize efficiency in a constantly growing ecosystem.\n\nAddressing this issue is crucial to ensure the long-term scalability and sustainability of Ethereum.\n\nThe solution proposed by Buterin aims to simplify the process without sacrificing the security and integrity of the network.\n\nButerin\u2019s three proposals to simplify the process\n\nButerin outlined three possible solutions at the Ethereum research forum on December 27th. The common focus of the proposals is to reduce the number of signatures required per slot to 8,192 in the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDecentralized staking pools: The first solution proposes the introduction of decentralized staking pools. This would involve increasing the minimum amount of ether required to run a validator, encouraging operators to collaborate and pool their resources. This approach could not only lighten the workload of individual validators but also promote an atmosphere of cooperation and mutualism within the Ethereum network. two levels of stakers: The second solution involves creating two levels of stakers: one with more demanding requirements and the other with lighter requirements. These two levels would be treated differently in the block finalization process. This structure could provide greater flexibility and accessibility for different types of participants in the network, balancing security and inclusivity. Rotating participants: Finally, the third proposal suggests the adoption of a system of rotating participants, where a random set of validators is selected for each slot. This system would distribute the workload and reduce the total number of signatures, but it would add complexity to the system. This method could improve fairness and decentralization, ensuring a more even distribution of responsibilities and rewards among participants.\n\nConclusion\n\nButerin\u2019s proposal represents a significant step towards a more efficient and effective implementation of the PoS mechanism in Ethereum.\n\nBy reducing the complexity and workload of validators, Ethereum could achieve greater scalability and security. It is clear that the future of Ethereum, with its transition to the proof of stake model, still holds many innovations and potential improvements.\n\nIn addition, this evolution highlights Ethereum\u2019s ongoing commitment to finding solutions that not only improve network performance, but also contribute to greater decentralization and democracy in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nButerin\u2019s vision for a leaner and more robust system could prove crucial in the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry, marking an era of new possibilities and applications."

        "title": "Ethereum's Path to Efficiency: Vitalik Buterin's Proposal for a Lighter PoS System - Coinnounce",
        "content": "Innovative Steps Towards a Streamlined Ethereum\n\nEthereum's co-founder Vitalik Buterin has put forth a groundbreaking proposal aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. This proposal, which centers on making the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism both simpler and lighter, could be a game-changer in blockchain technology.\n\nReducing the Burden: A Shift in Validator Signatures\n\nOn December 28, Buterin introduced a strategy to reduce the number of signatures required from validators. This reduction is expected to significantly lighten the load on the Ethereum network. The current system supports a vast number of validators \u2014 approximately 895,000 \u2014 in an effort to achieve decentralization and facilitate broader participation in staking.\n\nHowever, this high number of validators leads to considerable technical challenges. The network is tasked with processing around 28,000 signatures per slot, which Buterin describes as an excessively high load.\n\nAddressing Technical Challenges and Participation Issues\n\nButerin highlighted several compromises that come with supporting such a load, including limited quantum resistance, complex forking processes, and the need to scale signatures through sophisticated methods like zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs). Moreover, the current system falls short of its goal to enable widespread participation due to the high minimum stake required to become a validator.\n\nProposing a Balanced Solution\n\nA PoS simplification proposal: make a design that only requires 8192 signatures per slot (even with SSF), making the consensus implementation considerably simpler and lighter.https://t.co/Z8mK7vZx7g \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 27, 2023\n\nTo address these issues, Buterin suggests a moderate approach, reducing the number of signatures per slot to approximately 8,192 from the existing 28,000. This change would lead to significant technical simplifications, enhance quantum resistance, and maintain a high total of slashable ETH (1-2 million ETH). Slashable ETH is a critical mechanism for encouraging proper validator behavior.\n\nButerin proposed three potential methods to achieve this goal: fully decentralized staking pools, a two-tiered staking system with both 'heavy' and 'light' options, and a rotating participation model with accountable committees.\n\nAnticipating a Manageable Future Load\n\nThe primary benefit of Buterin's proposal is the establishment of a predictable and manageable future signature load. This foresight would greatly simplify protocol and infrastructure development. \"The future load of the Ethereum protocol becomes no longer an unknown,\" Buterin stated, adding that the signature load could be increased in the future through hard forks, but only when technological advancements can support a larger number of signatures-per-slot efficiently.\n\nButerin's Caution Against Overextension\n\nIn May, Buterin had cautioned against overstretching Ethereum's consensus mechanism beyond its primary functions of block validation and network security. This new proposal is in line with his vision of a streamlined, efficient blockchain that remains true to its core purposes."

        "content": "Ethereum price validated the inverse head and should formation, which is a known bullish pattern.\n\nOn the short-term timeframe, ETH is likely set to witness another 5% growth to meet the target price set by the pattern.\n\nPrice indicators also suggest room for further increases; however, ETH might not be able to breach $2,440.\n\nAhead of the new year, cryptocurrencies are exhibiting volatility, with no asset following a fixed pattern. This kind of behavior is expected before a major event that can have a considerable impact on the price action, and in the crypto market\u2019s case, it is the upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price sees another bout of growth\n\nEthereum price trading at $2,433 recently breached a crucial resistance level marked at $2,334. This price point is key to a historically known bullish pattern called the inverse head and shoulder formation.\n\nThe Head and shoulder formation generally signals a bearish outcome, but this pattern does the opposite. Inverse head and shoulders is a reversal pattern that is formed by three consecutive lows along with two intermediate highs. The first and third lows are called shoulders, located approximately at the same level above the second low \u2013 the head. Another important line is the one drawn along the intermediate highs \u2013 the neckline.\n\nThe pattern is completed only when the right shoulder rises above the neckline, suggesting that further rallying will be akin to the height of the head.\n\nIn the case of ETH, the height of the head marks a $218 growth, placing the target at $218 above $2,334. This brings the expected rise to $2,551, marking a 9.3% growth. Since, on the 8-hour chart, Ethereum price has already satisfied the pattern with the breach of the neckline, there is room for further growth.\n\nETH/USD 8-hour chart\n\nTrading at $2,433, ETH could still rise by another 5% before reaching the target price, breaching which would set the altcoin up for an increase to $3,000.\n\nPrice indicators, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), are both exhibiting room for bullishness.\n\nEthereum RSI and MACD\n\nHowever, a failed breach of the target price could bring ETH back down to $2,400, which could happen if short-term traders look for profit-taking as well, invalidating the bullish thesis."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, recently outlined a trio of potential solutions to address a critical complexity issue in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. His proposals, targeting the burgeoning challenge of managing digital signatures within the Ethereum network, were detailed in a post on the Ethereum Research forum. Buterin focuses on streamlining the process to require only 8,192 signatures per slot, simplifying and lightening the network\u2019s load.\n\nVitalik Buterin Unveils Two-Tier Staking System Idea\n\nThe first approach Vitalik Buterin suggests involves the transformation of staking pools. By increasing the minimum ether required to run a validator, smaller validator operations would need to combine their resources. This consolidation aims to reduce the overall number of validators, thereby lessening the signature workload.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis solution is about scaling down the number of participants and fostering a more collaborative and resource-shared environment within the Ethereum network. While compelling in its simplicity, this method raises questions about the impact on smaller validators and the potential centralization of power among larger staking pools.\n\nButerin\u2019s second proposal introduces a two-tier staking system. This novel approach distinguishes between stakers with varying responsibilities and requirements. The two layers of stakers would be integrated differently in the block finalization process, with one layer shouldering heavier requirements and the other operating under lighter ones.\n\nThis bifurcation could create a more balanced system, where responsibilities and rewards are aligned with the capabilities and commitments of different stakers. However, this solution also introduces complexity in managing these two distinct groups and ensuring fair and effective participation from both.\n\nNew Ethereum Model Aims to Reduce Signatures\n\nThe final solution put forth by Buterin involves a rotating system of validators. In this model, a random set of validators would be selected for each slot, distributing the workload more evenly across the network. While this approach could effectively reduce the number of signatures needed, it introduces new complexities.\n\nThe random selection process must ensure fairness and transparency while maintaining network security and efficiency. This solution balances reducing the signature burden and maintaining a diverse and decentralized pool of validators.\n\nEach of these proposed solutions by Buterin comes with its advantages and challenges. The central theme in all three is the balancing act between reducing the signature workload and maintaining the decentralized ethos of the Ethereum network.\n\nRead Also: Ether Poised to Outshine Bitcoin in 2024, ETC Group Report Predicts\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "In a recent blog post titled \u201cMake Ethereum Cypherpunk Again\u201d the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin has expressed his thoughts on the current state of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Founder Voices Concerns Over Faded Web3 Vision\n\nIn a blog post published on December 28, Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin reflected on his past experiences from a decade ago where he witnessed Bitcoin\u2019s steady adoption and integration into daily life activities. In this reflection, Buterin highlighted the transformative vision he visualizes of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I bring these memories up is that they remind me of a deeper vision underlying crypto: we are not here to just create isolated tools and games, but rather build holistically toward a more free and open society and economy, where the different parts \u2013 technological, social and economic \u2013 fit into each other,\u201d Buterin wrote in the blog post.\n\nWhile maintaining a positive perspective of the Web3 ecosystem, Buterin acknowledged that the vision for the Web3 space has become somewhat diminished. He noted that the vision had begun fading into the background since 2017.\n\nThe Ethereum founder highlighted several reasons for his statement, with the foremost factor being the rise of transaction fees, which he identified as the number one culprit for the fading Web3 vision.\n\nButerin explained that when the cost of writing to the chain was $0.001 or $0.1, many individuals would actively engage with blockchains. However, as transaction fees rise to $100, a specific audience, the degen gamblers remain willing to pay the substantial cost.\n\nButerin pointed out that when degen gamblers become the predominant users of the chain, it alters the perception of the public and adversely affects the internal culture of the crypto space.\n\nHe also revealed that \u201cthere is a large ideological rift where significant parts of the non-blockchain decentralization community see the crypto world as a distraction, and not as a kindred spirit and a powerful ally. In many countries, people do use cryptocurrency to send and save money, but they often do this through centralized means.\u201d\n\nETH price at $2,372 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCypherpunk Future Achievable Amid 2023 Development\n\nIn his blog post, Buterin highlighted several positive developments made in 2023 that could facilitate the development of a cypherpunk future for the Web3 space.\n\nSome of these developments include the existence of Blockchain Rollups which are special Layer-2 blockchains that process transactions off-chain. Buterin also noted the expansion of second-generation privacy solutions like Railway and Nocturne, alongside advancements in Zero Knowledge Proofs, a powerful tool used for enhancing privacy and security.\n\nConcluding his list of positive developments within the Web3 space in 2023, Buterin affirmed that these changes would create a great opportunity for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHe stated that the developments would \u201cmake at least a part of the Ethereum ecosystem actually be the permissionless, decentralized, censorship-resistant, open source ecosystem that we originally came to build.\u201d\n\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from Tradingview.com"

It is distributed across a network of computers instead of a single location and is, importantly, decentralized due to this nature. A blockchain is a data structure block holding key transaction details, like date, time, and amount. Every time you make a transaction, you\u2019re making up a block that will add to the chain, with each new block\n\nTrending Lux Algo Offers a Lifeline as Beginner Crypto Investors Struggle\n\nreferring back to previous blocks in a way that creates a secure, immutable data record.\n\nThis decentralized, transparent, and automated system enables security, accuracy, and permanence in recording everything from financial transactions to asset ledgers, credentials, records, and contracts in an open and trusted manner. It has disruptive potential across finance, supply chain, and healthcare industries.\n\nWhat Is Solana?\n\nAs we mentioned, Solana is one such blockchain, and its position in cryptocurrency right now puts it in direct competition with the market leader: Ethereum. However, it has a lot of benefits over Ethereum and is therefore fighting for space in the market as a superior product. Ethereum has reason to worry- it has seen tremendous growth in 2022, even amidst the crypto winter, appreciating over 85% year-to-date while most other cryptos declined. Additionally, it\u2019s in the top three most actively developed blockchain networks alongside Ethereum and Polkadot based on activity metrics. Over 400 projects have launched on Solana across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 spaces. Areas like DeFi show dominance with over $1.2 billion total value locked.\n\nSolana shows strong usage and developer momentum, pointing to a promising spot staking its claim among the future internet of blockchains. It is a highly scalable, open-source blockchain network that utilizes innovative technologies to achieve high throughput and low costs without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Solana?\n\nSo, what makes Solana such a dark horse in the fintech industry? Solana is credited with being the core innovation for the \u201cproof of history\u201d method, which is a sequencing technique that cryptographically verifies the passage of time between events, greatly boosting efficiency. For comparison, Ethereum recently moved to Proof of Stake, which uses significantly less energy, allowing Solana to reach 50,000 transactions per second, orders of magnitude higher than networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and therefore costs, run well below $0.01 per transaction.\n\nThis speed is Solana\u2019s best calling card. For users, Solana promises to enable fast, inexpensive decentralized applications \u2013 everything from DeFi to NFTs to Web3 networks built to scale to millions. It is also easy to build on, with familiar coding languages and SDK availability leading to rapid application development.\n\nAdditionally, Solana utilizes a sturdy underlying Proof of Stake consensus and communication architecture that brings resilient decentralized security to high throughput environments.\n\nWhat Are the Key Innovations of Solana?\n\nAnother innovation of Solana is the Gulf Stream protocol, an innovative networking architecture Solana uses to enable massive transaction throughput. Before they are confirmed by validators and established early transaction orders, it enables the forwarding of transactions from node to node across Solana\u2019s network. This is important because typical blockchains flood the network with unconfirmed transaction data, causing bottlenecks, whereas Gulf Stream prevents network overload.\n\nWhat Does the Impact of Solana Mean for Investors?\n\nThe profile and adoption of Solana have been rising exponentially recently. As more decentralized apps choose to be built on Solana, investment in the ecosystem could ride a wave of growth.\n\nBecause Solana enables fast and scalable blockchain in areas like DeFi, NFTs, Web3 networks, and gaming, it offers cheap fees and extra speed. This makes these new apps much more viable at scale than on other chains like Ethereum, which brands and businesses around the world are likely to be interested in.\n\nIncreased real-world usage and speculative mania have led to massive price appreciation for Solana\u2019s cryptocurrency SOL, from under $2 in 2020 to over $200 by November 2021. With faster transaction finality, higher throughput, and cheaper gas, Solana is facilitating more disruptive and user-friendly decentralized network models. This brings new early-stage investment opportunities.\n\nWhat Is Solana\u2019s Current Competitor?\n\nEthereum\u2019s position as a competitor to Solana is as yet unchallenged. It is the market leader and, therefore, has a first-mover advantage and an enormous lead on developer ecosystem size and usage compared to Solana or any other layer 1 blockchain. For example, over 3,400 decentralized apps run on Ethereum today.\n\nHowever, where Ethereum struggles with network congestion and high gas fees, Solana touts faster speeds, higher throughput capability, and significantly cheaper transactions \u2013 positioning itself as an \u201cEthereum Killer.\u201d"

        "content": "Solana (SOL) co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko blew up Crypto X with a recent admission when he noted that the protocol is now already an \u201cEthereum L2 with the Wormhole Eigenlayer.\u201d\n\nLightning the Solana versus Ethereum Rivalry\n\nThough the shared X post from Anatoly Yakovenko is a technology-based communication, it has a major but subtle aim to lighten the ongoing rivalry between Solana and its bigger rival, Ethereum (ETH).\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to the Solana co-founder, a major overlap exists between some of the validators operating decentralized applications that exist as a connecting bridge between both protocols.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge overlap between solana validators and Lido eth L1 operators and wormhole operators. They are all effectively under heavy \u201cre-staking\u201d incentives not to withhold data or mess with the state root between the chains,\u201d his post reads.\n\nWhile Yakovenko\u2019s initial post on the subject was shared on December 25, media reports failed to see the initial ironic intention behind the post. By all means, Solana is bigger as a protocol when compared to the next capitalized Ethereum L2, Polygon and it has a thriving ecosystem that will undoubtedly prevent it from staying under the shadows of Ethereum.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been a lot of controversial community talks between members of the Solana and Ethereum communities in which some of the former try to elevate their technologies over the latter. This narrative was deepened as Solana started flipping Ethereum in key performance metrics.\n\nYakovenko has time and again tried to caution the community against such narratives and this latest post might be another way to show both can co-exist.\n\nEqual Ecosystem Criticism\n\nWithin the space of 2 weeks, the duo of Ethereum and Solana have faced intense criticism from some market analysts who took out time to highlight the flaws of both protocols.\n\nPeter Brandt recently took on Ethereum, noting that he has shorted the coin as he believes it is on its way to a low of $650. He based his bearish assumptions on the fact that Ethereum is unfriendly to use as a result of expensive network or gas fees. Solana on the other hand got its first major critic in Fred Krueger who said many of the innovations being pushed out by the protocol are \u201cpure science fiction.\u201d\n\nWhile neither of the blockchain protocols is perfect, Yakovenko\u2019s post is an indication that both can truly exist together with more benefit to the broader crypto ecosystem.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Manta Pacific's TVL spiked 1,250% in December.\n\nIt is now the seventh biggest layer 2 blockchain network on Ethereum.\n\nOther layer 2s are also ratcheting up airdrops.\n\nCrypto airdrop hunters have deposited $345 million into Manta Pacific, Manta Network\u2019s Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, since December 14.\n\nWhy the sudden interest?\n\nBecause of an airdrop expected in early 2024.\n\nAirdrop hunters have deposited Ether and stablecoins into the blockchain to obtain rewards scheduled for distribution in January.\n\nManta Pacific\u2019s TVL has skyrocketed 1,250% in December. This spike has made Manta Pacific the seventh largest Ethereum layer 2 blockchain per total value locked, according to data from Ethereum layer 2 tracking portal L2Beat.\n\nTVL is a metric that tracks how much crypto is locked up in a DeFi protocol\u2019s smart contracts, or in all DeFi protocols running on a given blockchain.\n\nPromising signs\n\nFor Kenny Li, co-founder of blockchain developer p0x Labs and Manta Network contributor, the TVL growth is encouraging.\n\n\u201cThese early promising signs mean that a new contender is emerging from DeFi to challenge the likes of zkSync and Base,\u201d Li told DL News.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBase and zkSync are also Ethereum layer 2 blockchains.\n\nSmart contracts\n\nThe smart contract that holds these deposits is not verified on Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, so it\u2019s difficult for independent security experts to determine its safety.\n\nManta\u2019s team says the contract has been reviewed by security experts.\n\n\u201cThe contracts have been audited by Veridise,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the audit is unverified on Etherscan as the contract is not open-sourced but we plan on having these verified in the future.\u201d\n\nFor risk-tolerant crypto degens, the unverified contract has not proved to be an issue as they\u2019ve run up nine-figure dollar deposits.\n\nInvestors were driven to deposit these funds as part of Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign.\n\nIt promises five layers of rewards for early investors, including an airdrop of 50 million Manta tokens. Manta isn\u2019t trading yet, so those 50 million tokens do not yet have market value.\n\nGetting a STONE token\n\nThis TVL growth is most likely driven by the promised airdrop because the project\u2019s canonical bridge has attracted only $28 million in deposits since its creation three months ago.\n\nManta airdrop hopefuls receive a token called STONE in exchange for their locked Ether deposits in the blockchain.\n\nSTONE is a so-called yield-bearing token, according to Manta\u2019s documentation. Airdrop hunters will be able to redeem STONE for Manta tokens in January.\n\nAs a yield-bearing token, airdrop hunters can use STONE to earn points on protocols within Manta Pacific that support the token. By doing so, investors can farm more STONE tokens and potentially increase their promised Manta token airdrop.\n\nDepositors also earn NFTs, which can be sold on Element, a multichain NFT marketplace.\n\nParticipants are also hunting for NFT combinations that will yield even bigger airdrop rewards, a process that requires them to acquire six different NFTs from the campaign that can be combined to get a premium NFT that offers greater rewards.\n\n$1 billion in investments\n\nManta is only the latest in a growing trend of projects enticing significant early backing with the promise of rewards early next year.\n\nBlast, a planned Ethereum layer 2 blockchain project, managed to attract about $650 million in barely a week after it was announced in November. The project now sits on top of over $1 billion in investments.\n\nLike Blast, Manta Pacific is also invite-only with prospective new entrants requiring invite codes from existing investors.\n\nManta Network did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Manta Network core contributor Kenny Li.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "title": "Three new token projects ride $1bn EigenLayer hype - DLNews",
        "content": "Three liquid restaking projects have launched new tokens in the past two weeks.\n\nTheir debuts come amid a surge of interest in EigenLayer, the first staking protocol on Ethereum.\n\nProponents say they could kick off a new bull market or lead to the next high-profile crash.\n\nLiquid restaking tokens that will allow crypto investors to leverage Ether for greater yields are riding excitement sparked by EigenLayer, a six-month-old protocol that surged to more than $1 billion in user deposits last week.\n\nTheir rise could kick off another speculative frenzy, or another Terra-style crash, according to people in the industry who spoke to DL News.\n\nThree tokens have launched in the past two weeks, and one company announced a fundraise led by prominent crypto-focused venture capital firms.\n\nThis flurry of news comes amid EigenLayer\u2019s decision to raise its cap on user deposits. That\u2019s because the current crop of liquid restaking providers all intend to build on top of EigenLayer, the first protocol to enable restaking on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cThe protocols are taking the first steps into this new staking realm,\u201d Pedro Verdades, co-founder of liquid restaking provider InceptionLRT, told DL News. \u201cWe will see more and more of this over the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Kelp DAO launched a liquid restaking token, rsETH. As of Tuesday, users had deposited more than $125 million worth of crypto, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nKelp DAO deposits topped $100 million a week after its launch.\n\nOn December 18, liquid restaking provider Renzo launched its own liquid restaking token, ezETH, and Rio, a competitor, announced a seed round led by venture capital firms Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital, and Breyer Capital. Rio did not disclose the amount of the round.\n\nOn December 20, users began claiming a governance token, RSTK, from Restake Finance, another liquid restaking provider.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThose three join Ether.Fi, which launched its restaking token, eETH, in November.\n\nSince an upgrade in 2022, Ethereum relies on a process called staking to verify and order transactions. To stake, users must lock up their Ether in exchange for an annual yield. Liquid staking providers such as Lido address the opportunity cost of locking up Ether by providing receipt tokens \u2014 staked Ether \u2014 that can be used in lieu of Ether across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nBiggest business in DeFi\n\nLiquid staking is now the biggest business in DeFi, with more than $32 billion in user deposits, according to Defi Llama.\n\nRestaking allows users to stake their staked Ether \u2014 not to secure Ethereum, but to secure protocols that would otherwise have to run on their own networks, such as the bridges that allow users to transfer tokens between otherwise incompatible blockchains.\n\nIn exchange for staked Ether, protocols using EigenLayer pay restakers, boosting the relatively risk-free yields they can earn from old-fashioned staking.\n\nLike liquid staking providers, liquid restaking providers address the opportunity cost of locking up staked Ether by providing receipt tokens.\n\nProponents say this will dramatically reduce the cost of certain protocols, such as bridges, other blockchains, oracles, and other technology critical to the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis is the most groundbreaking evolution since Ethereum,\u201d Verdades said. \u201cIn a few years, this will be a $20 billion to $25 billion industry and we\u2019re [frontrunning] it!\u201d\n\nRisks\n\nStill, others say it\u2019s a business model that could cause systemic risk if providers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nThat\u2019s because liquid restaking is a leveraged play that allows users to effectively place bets on the various protocols that use EigenLayer, some of which may be poorly run.\n\nAs the market matures, observers predict liquid restaking tokens will integrate with the broader DeFi ecosystem and be used as collateral to borrow other crypto, mint stablecoins, and more.\n\nThose layers of leverage are potential points of failure, according to Lucas Kozinski, a founding contributor to Renzo. Liquid restaking providers will have to carefully manage which EigenLayer-based businesses they support and the yields they promise users.\n\n\u201cYou have to think about risk management, similar to collateral assets on a lending protocol,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\nGabe Tramble, co-founder of crypto research firm Shoal Research, agrees.\n\nIn a report on liquid restaking published this week, Tramble and a co-author detail some of the issues of the emerging sector.\n\n\u201cI do see significant risk though of rehypothecation,\u201d he told DL News, referring to the practice in which a financial institution users customer collateral for its own purposes. \u201c[It\u2019s] something to keep an eye on.\u201d"

        "content": "In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of cryptocurrency. Although it is generally deemed a volatile investment market, many show interest in purchasing crypto due to higher rates of return. Heading towards a new year, investors are actively seeking opportunities to enhance their portfolios and earn greater returns on investment. Ahead of 2024, experts have already shared their predictions about cryptocurrency. Here's what they are saying: Representational Image\n\nBinance to lose its No.1 position for spot trading\n\nFollowing the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX in November last year, Binance saw a boost in its trading value. However, according to New York-based investment management company VanEck, 2024 is expected to be a bearish year for Binance.\n\nAccording to their X, formerly Twitter post, \u201cBinance will lose the #1 position for spot trading, with competitors like OKX, Bybit, Coinbase, and Bitget contending for leadership. Coinbase's futures market may exceed $1 billion daily volume as regulated index inclusion becomes key.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: IRS tax bracket changes in 2024 may result in bigger paychecks, what are they?\n\nSurge in Ethereum revenue\n\nEthereum still remains one of the most popular crypto choices for investors. According to the 2024 crypto predictions by Bitwise on X, Ethereum will rake in more than 2.5 times its current revenue. According to the post shared by Ryan Rasmussen on the platform, \u201cEthereum revenue will more than 2x to $5b as users flock to crypto applications. In 2023, users will pay ~$2.3b in fees to use Ethereum. We think that will at least 2x in 2024, making Ethereum one of the fastest-growing large-scale tech platforms in the world.\u201d\n\nCoinbase to double in revenue\n\nCoinbase is an American publicly traded company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. It is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States in terms of trading volume. Experts believe that its revenue will nearly double in numbers.\n\nAccording to Ryan Rasmussen, \u201cCoinbase\u2019s revenue will double, beating Wall Street expectations by at least 10x. Historically, Coinbase's trading volumes surge in bull markets, and we expect the same to happen again. Plus, they\u2019ve launched a wide range of new products that are showing traction.\u201d\n\nBitcoin may value a quarter of a million dollars\n\nTo date, Bitcoin reigns as one of the most popular and hefty cryptos. In 2024, its value is expected to reach a quarter of a million dollars, according to experts. Venture capitalist Tim Draper said in an interview with Coin Bureau, \u201cI would say that my number $250,000 will probably come pretty soon, so I\u2019ll stick with $250,000 \u2026 I actually think that if it hits $250,000, it\u2019ll go way past it.\u201d\n\nAnother expert on X, formerly Twitter, claimed the same. The Bitcoin Therapist's tweet reads, \u201cWith everything on the table coming in 2024, it\u2019s hard to imagine Bitcoin under $250,000. Everyone in this space knows that this is the greatest opportunity of a lifetime. For everyone else, they\u2019ll get Bitcoin at the price they deserve.\u201d"

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin lauds Arbitrum; ARB rallies 22% in 24 hours - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The Ethereum co-founder praised Arbitrum for becoming a stage 1 rollup.\n\nARB\u2019s price increased by 22% in 24 hours, indicating a drive toward $2.\n\nA few hours after Vitalik Buterin gave Arbitrum [ARB] a good mark for being the only stage 1 rollup, the price of its native token jumped by 22%. Buterin, who is the co-founder of Ethereum [ETH], had a conversation about the L2 on Warpcast.\n\nAccording to him, Arbitrum\u2019s move to stage 1 means that the project has become the first L2 to inch toward real decentralization.\n\nBeing a stage 1 rollup means Arbitrum has met the five requirements of becoming completely decentralized. One of these conditions includes allowing users to exit without the help of permission operators.\n\nAnother is having a complete fraud-proof system in place.\n\nFor context, a fraud-proof enables on-chain scalability while acting as protection against incorrect state transitions. In his statement, Buterin noted that he would be glad if other rollups could get to stage 1 by 2024.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy we have one unambiguously stage 1 rollup (and a couple more very-close-to-stage-1 rollups) this year. Real decentralization. Let\u2019s get to ten stage 1 rollups, and some degree of sequencer decentralization, in the next year.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto observed the chart shared by the Ethereum co-founder. According to the details, showed that the OP Mainnet, zkSyncn Era, and Base were at stage zero.\n\nThis implies that the projects were only left with one requirement to become a stage 1 rollup.\n\nHow did ARB react?\n\nAt press time, ARB\u2019s price was $1.59. Also, the price increase would be a relief to ARB holders who have had to endure an encouraging price action since the Arbitrum Foundation AirDrop to early users.\n\nThough ARB is 86% down from its launch price, the 76.45% 90-day increase implies that the token could be on its way to a new high. One other factor driving ARB\u2019s movement is ETH.\n\nAt press time, ETH had broken out and its value was changing hands around $2,389.\n\nFurthermore, Arbitrum\u2019s fundamentals as an Ethereum L2 mean that there is a high chance that the ARB strongly correlates with ETH. On the derivative end of the market, AMBCrypto considered the ARB\u2019s Open Interest.\n\nUsing Coinglass data, the Open Interest had increased by 29% in the last 24 hours. Open Interest is the number of outstanding futures contracts linked to a cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen the Open Interest increases, it implies a rise in open long/short positions. However, a decline in the Open Interest suggests a drop in liquidity allocated to contracts.\n\nRead Arbitrum\u2019s [ARB] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nConsidering the price action, the rise in Open Interest might trigger a continuation of the uptrend. So, it is not out of place to project a rise to $2 for ARB. However, market participants would need to watch out for ETH\u2019s price action.\n\nShould ETH slow down its momentum, ARB might do the same. At the same time, if ETH runs in the $2,500 direction, then ARB might breach the $2 mark."

        "content": "The prices of Shiba Inu and PEPE, although there has been movement in both of these assets, have not performed as well as expected. This could be attributed to the muted performance that Ethereum, the parent network of both assets, have put on recently, and thus, they have followed in its footsteps. However, as Ethereum begins to see better upside, things could change for both of these assets according to one analyst.\n\nWatch Out For Shiba Inu As Ethereum Begins To Break Out\n\nEthereum has started moving up again and is currently trading above $2,400 at the time of this writing. Naturally, crypto investors expect its ecosystem tokens to follow the same path, and one of those is Shiba Inu, as pseudonymous crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo explains.\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), the analyst shares their expectations for the Shiba Inu price going forward. Crypto Kaleo warns investors to keep an eye out for the Shiba Inu price especially as Ethereum begins another uptrend.\n\nThe crypto analyst expects good movement in price, possibly something that could rival its 2021 movement. Kaleo points out that the SHIB price is currently still trading in a base range of $0.00001, and this is a level that the price has maintained for almost one week now.\n\nGiven that the crypto\u2019s price has stayed in this range for so long, Kaleo expects a good thing if the price is able to break out of this range. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see another god candle similar to October \u201921 when it finally breaks out of this base range,\u201d Kaleo said.\n\nAlso a reminder to not sleep on $SHIB as $ETH starts to break out. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see another god candle similar to October \u201921 when it finally breaks out of this base range. pic.twitter.com/jRYYW6gcjq \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) December 28, 2023\n\nSHIB price above $0.00001 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nPEPE Expected To Follow The Same Path\n\nAs the Ethereum price recovers, Shiba Inu is not the only cryptocurrency that is expected to do well. Another coin that the crypto analyst points out is poised for good things during this time as well is the PEPE meme coin.\n\nPEPE has also been on a rather slow path over the last few months despite the fact that the Bitcoin price has been going up. There have been more dips than pumps, but Kaleo expects that this could change quickly as the pump commences.\n\nKaleo compared the expected movement to what happened with Solana (SOL) and BONK. The BONK price had risen drastically as the SOL price pumped. In the same vein, the crypto analyst expects the meme coin to reach a new all-time high as the Ethereum price begins to move as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be one of the most obvious hindsight trades out there when it happens,\u201d Kaleo explains.\n\nThe same way $BONK printed new ATHs vs $SOL when it broke out, I see $PEPE printing new ATHs vs $ETH as it starts to move. It\u2019ll be one of the most obvious hindsight trades out there when it happens. pic.twitter.com/cvSPd9bxSt \u2014 K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) December 27, 2023\n\nFeatured image from CoinMarketCap, chart from Tradingview.com"

This is suggested by BlockchainCenter\u2019s Ethereum rainbow price chart, reflecting momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn particular, specific cryptocurrency traders and investors leverage Ethereum\u2019s rainbow chart to analyze the historical trends of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. They examine its relationship with various moving averages (MAs) and identify patterns that can inform more informed investment decisions.\n\nThe chart indicates that Ethereum is presently situated in the \u2018Still Cheap\u2019 phase, represented by the light green color. It fluctuates within the range of $1,597 to $2,306, residing below the \u2018Hold\u2019 yellow zone spanning $2,302 to $3,342, based on information observed by Finbold on December 27.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart.

        "title": "StarkNet Crypto Airdrop: How to be eligible for STRK Airdrop? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "If you\u2019re into airdrops, Starknet is a must-check for one of the most promising airdrops in 2023. Its parent company, StarkWare, has received a whopping $273 million in funding and is currently valued at $8 billion. This season seems to be full of crypto airdrops. We have already published two potential airdrops: Scroll Name Service (SNS) and DeBank\n\nStarknet is now live on its Mainnet, and the tasks for the airdrop are pretty straightforward. You can complete them in just about 20 minutes, depending on how quickly you move. So, let\u2019s take a look at this StarkNet airdrop article in more detail.\n\nStarkNet stands out as a Layer 2 network developed by StarkWare to enhance the scalability of the Ethereum network through Validity Rollups (or Zk Rollups). As highlighted on its website, StarkNet empowers decentralized applications (dapps) to attain unlimited scalability for both transactions and computation, all while benefiting from the robust security features of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nA key component of their offering is StarkEx, which has gained substantial social validation, as evidenced by its impressive clientele. The permissioned solution serves as the hosting platform for notable clients such as ImmutableX, dYdX, Sorare, ApeX, and Immutable, showcasing the widespread adoption and trust within the industry.\n\nWhat is $STRK Token?\n\nThe deployment of the StarkNet token ($STRK) took place on the Ethereum mainnet on November 16, 2022. Despite being deployed, the tokens are not currently available for sale. Notably, the StarkWare team has maintained a high level of transparency regarding the launch, distribution, and allocation plan of the token.\n\nThis information is derived from a blog post on the Medium platform authored by StarkWare, where they detail their approach and plans for the StarkNet token.\n\nHas the $STRK Airdrop Been Confirmed?\n\nOn December 8, 2023, Starknet officially announced a 1.8 billion $STRK token airdrop. Despite the confirmation, there is no specified timeline provided. While there\u2019s still an opportunity to participate in the Starknet airdrop, it remains uncertain whether the snapshot has already been taken. Although there might be a risk of it being too late, akin to Solana airdrops, you can explore the possibility of participating in airdrops offered by popular Starknet decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nHow to be eligible for Starknet Airdrop?\n\nStarknet is currently operating on its mainnet, providing numerous opportunities to engage with applications that may make you eligible for an airdrop. The process involves bridging funds and engaging with well-known Starknet decentralized applications (dApps), such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and NFT marketplaces. It\u2019s a straightforward process, and here are what I consider the most beneficial tasks for maximizing your chances in this potential airdrop:\n\nCreate a MetaMask Wallet\n\nFor this guide, we\u2019ll require two wallets, beginning with MetaMask. If you haven\u2019t installed it yet, visit the Metamask website to create your wallet. Then, add some Ethereum to it.\n\nCreate a Starknet Wallet\n\nStarknet does not operate on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so using MetaMask, which is designed for the EVM, is not suitable for most Starknet applications. To interact effectively, you\u2019ll need a specialized Starknet wallet. The top two options for this purpose are Argent and Braavos.\n\nVisit https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/ or https://braavos.app/\n\nSet up your wallet on the same browser/device as your MetaMask\n\nBridge ETH to Starknet\n\nBridging to Starknet: Exploring the Pathways\n\nDifferent Bridges for Starknet:\n\nStarkgate Bridge\n\nOrbiter Finance Bridge\n\nLayerSwap\n\nNow it\u2019s time to transfer some ETH to Starknet using the native bridge, StarkGate. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit https://starkgate.starknet.io\n\n2. Connect both your MetaMask and Starknet Wallet.\n\n3. Initiate the process to bridge ETH to StarkGate. Ensure you send enough ETH to cover the gas fees. Transaction costs on Starknet typically range from $0.50 to $3.00.\n\n4. You have the option to bridge ETH directly from the Ethereum Mainnet. Alternatively, if you want to minimize gas fees, you can also bridge the ETH mentioned with the help of the above-mentioned bridges.\n\nUtilize the foremost decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Starknet\n\nNow that we have money on Starknet, let\u2019s use some popular apps. Decentralized exchanges are an easy way to do things on the blockchain, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for to get airdrops. According to DeFi Llama, here are the biggest decentralized exchanges on Starknet:\n\nEkubo\n\nMySwap\n\nJediswap\n\n10kswap\n\nHead to these decentralized exchanges (DEXs), connect your wallet, and exchange tokens on each platform. You have the flexibility to swap any token and any amount, as many times as you like. Additionally, consider adding liquidity to the pools and withdrawing it.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accumulate at least 5-10 transactions in your wallet or even more, providing a solid beginning. For optimal airdrop rewards, return every 30 days or more and perform similar tasks.\n\nAnticipating the STARK Airdrop: Unveiling the Plans for 2024\n\nThe STARK Airdrop is on the horizon, with an impressive allocation of 900 million STRK tokens for transparent distribution across various programs. This implies multiple airdrops, emphasizing a focus on long-term engagement with the network.\n\nThe timeframe is expected to be lengthy, so don\u2019t expect the 900 million STRK tokens to be ready for an airdrop next week. This approach encourages sustained engagement with the blockchain.\n\n900M STRK for \u201cUser Rebates\u201d\n\n50M for \u201cOn-Chain Incentives for DeFi\u201d\n\nThe allocation of 900 million STRK tokens for \u201cUser Rebates\u201d suggests a potential refund for ETH spent on gas fees by users. Another 50 million is allocated for \u201cOn-Chain Incentives for DeFi,\u201d with direct, indirect, and retroactive incentivization in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Protocols are expected to receive tokens, and Yield Farming on Starknet will commence.\n\nTimeframe and Outlook: Q1 2024 and Beyond\n\nThe research phase is nearing completion, and execution and deployment are scheduled for Q1 2024. This provides a clear timeline, especially for \u201cOn-Chain Incentives for DeFi,\u201d indicating that STRK yield farming will likely begin early next year.\n\nDevelopers and Dapps: Anticipating New Announcements\n\nSubject to Terms & Conditions: Possible Exclusions\n\nFor developers and decentralized applications (Dapps), there are imminent announcements. A formal announcement is expected next week. It\u2019s noted that certain terms and conditions may apply, potentially including exclusions for the USA."

        "content": "Anatoly Yakovenko says 'Solana is Ethereum' in layer-2 scalability debate h3>\n\nSolana creator Anatoly Yakovenko recently referred to Solana as an Ethereum layer-2 solution through its Wormhole eigenlayer in a post on X.\n\nIn the exchange, Yakovenko positioned the blockchain as an Ethereum layer-2 while responding to a tweet listing various other L2 solutions, including Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon, among others. He wrote:\n\n\u201cSolana is ethereum! Solana is an ethereum L2 through the wormhole eigenlayer. Once danksharding is scaled up no one is going to stop you from submitting all the solana blocks into some data validating bridge contract on ethereum.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, the integration of Solana with Ethereum is facilitated by the Wormhole eigenlayer, which would eventually allow the potential for Solana blocks to be submitted into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum after key scalability upgrades.\n\nOn the rise\n\nFollowing a challenging start to 2023, Solana ended the year with a significant upturn. December was a particularly active month for the blockchain, showcasing one of the quickest price recoveries in the final quarter. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana impressively more than doubled, escalating from $671.62 million at the beginning of the month to $1.529 billion by December 26th.\n\nHowever, when denominated in SOL, the increase was more modest, from 11.35 million SOL to 12.56 million SOL in the same period. This discrepancy reflects the significant rise in SOL price, which climbed from $59.2 to $121.4, affecting the USD valuation of the TVL.\n\nNotably, Solana overtook XRP in market cap, becoming the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $34.8 billion as of December 20, 2023, following an 11% increase in Solana\u2019s value, which outpaced the broader market\u2019s 3% gain. The SOL/ETH ratio, comparing Solana\u2019s value to Ethereum\u2019s, also shows recovery, highlighting Solana\u2019s competitive stance.\n\nThe SOL/ETH ratio, a metric comparing the value of Solana (SOL) to Ethereum (ETH), is a critical measure of Solana\u2019s competitive position. This ratio has experienced significant fluctuations, with the most recent data showing a recovery in Solana\u2019s standing against Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s blockchain technology, known for its high performance and scalability, is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. The platform\u2019s success is attributed to its unique consensus algorithm, \u201cProof of History,\u201d which enables high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a popular choice among developers for dApps and DeFi projects.\n\nThe post Anatoly Yakovenko says \u2018Solana is Ethereum\u2019 in layer-2 scalability debate appeared first on CryptoSlate.\n\nCheck More Latest Cryptocurrency News Click Here\u2013 Latest Cryptocurrency News\n\nCheck More Business News Click Here\u2013 Latest Business News"
