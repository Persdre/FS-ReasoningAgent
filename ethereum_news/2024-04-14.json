        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Slipped Over the Weekend - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) remain three of the most-watched tokens for good reason. Unfortunately, onlookers have seen mostly downside price action over the weekend. Since market close on Friday, these three top digital assets have sunk 4.2%, 2.5% and 11.2%, respectively, as of 12:45 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nAn initial sharp decline was seen in all three tokens in early Saturday trading, in line with the reported escalation of the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. While each of these three tokens has made up some of this weekend's initial losses, it's clear that cryptocurrency is not immune from the geopolitical forces driving capital in and out of assets in times of uncertainty.\n\nThese moves are also significant because they come ahead of this week's expected Bitcoin halving, in which block rewards for miners will be cut in half. Typically, previous halvings have resulted in a booming price, which has bled into other crypto assets as well.\n\nBut given the anticipation around this rise, as well as capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, some investors appear to be betting that much of this rally might have already taken place, leading to caution heading into this key catalyst.\n\nLet's dive into some other key factors to consider when it comes to these three top tokens and their price action today.\n\nWhy all the negativity in the large-cap crypto space?\n\nBitcoin's move is perhaps most important to watch, as the largest cryptocurrency in the world heads into its latest halving, expected to take place on or about April 20. We'll have to see how the network responds, and how investors value the network as its inflation rate is halved yet again.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin did not rise on increased Iran-Israel tensions suggests that investors are continuing to view it more as a risk asset and less as a hedge against uncertainty. We'll have to see if this narrative shifts, particularly if some response from Israel is seen in the coming days.\n\nEthereum's move, while negative, has been the strongest of the three over the weekend. This is likely due to news that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved applications from three Chinese companies to list Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs in Hong Kong.\n\nNo official report from the SEC has been released, but this could signal that a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the U.S. is likely to be seen in short order. For now, overarching macro concerns appear to be stealing the spotlight from this otherwise positive catalyst. I would expect Ethereum to continue to outperform its fellow large-cap tokens in the coming weeks, as investors price this catalyst in.\n\nStory continues\n\nDogecoin's double-digit move lower over the weekend once again exemplifies this token's nature as a high-risk and high-leverage bet on momentum within the crypto space. A lack of any meaningful rhetoric from Elon Musk (and negative sentiment building around Tesla and its recent layoffs and full self-driving announcements) have investors seemingly looking for other options in the crypto realm right now.\n\nIs there upside on the horizon this week?\n\nCertainly, there are a number of bullish catalysts that could take these three top tokens higher this week. The Bitcoin halving and the reported approvals of spot Ethereum ETFs should be broadly bullish for the top two cryptos by market capitalization (and Dogecoin by default).\n\nThe thing is, uncertainty remains high right now, and investors remain on edge waiting to see if we're heading into yet another war. The feeling in financial markets is glum right now, meaning these catalysts could be overshadowed by this overarching sentiment, at least in the short term.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how these top tokens perform next weekend, as additional news arises around the two aforementioned key catalysts every crypto investor is watching right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

While this turbulence affected all digital assets, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, took a notable hit, experiencing an 18.43% decline, reaching a low of $2,852 per Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, amid the market chaos, a fascinating trend emerged \u2013 prominent players in the crypto sphere, often referred to as \"whales,\" showed unwavering confidence in Ethereum's potential. Notably, large addresses were observed accumulating substantial amounts of ETH during the price drop.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nWhale activities\n\nOne such whale, identified as \"0xE34,\" seized the opportunity to accumulate 1,000 ETH, worth approximately $3.15 million, from Binance at the market's lowest point. This particular address went on to accumulate an impressive 8,300 ETH, valued at around $25.12 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, another significant player, a wallet associated with Matrixport, made a decisive move by withdrawing 16,300 ETH, amounting to a staggering $51.1 million, from Binance amid the market turmoil. This wallet has been consistently withdrawing ETH from exchanges since March 29, accumulating a total of 67,286 ETH, valued at approximately $228.33 million, at an average price of $3,393.\n\nMatrixport, a prominent player in the crypto financial services sector, has been actively involved in facilitating digital asset management and trading for institutional and retail investors globally.\n\nThese substantial purchases of Ethereum during a period of market instability highlight the confidence of several major players in the potential of the leading altcoin. Despite geopolitical uncertainties and market volatility, Ethereum continues to maintain bullish sentiment among key holders."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s EIP-3074 \u2018upgrade\u2019 could let wallet makers steal your money - Protos",
        "content": "With momentum carried over from the relatively smooth hard fork upgrades Shapella (Shanghai+Capella) and Dencun (Deneb+Cancun), Ethereum\u2019s next hard fork was supposed to be a breeze. Nevertheless, several analysts are waving red flags about one of its code changes, EIP-3074.\n\nThrough EIP-3074, Pectra will introduce codes that permit users to delegate all of their Ethereum assets to so-called Invokers \u2014 externally owned accounts (EOA) that users must trust to not steal their money.\n\nFollowing the naming convention of \u2018star + city portmanteau,\u2019 the upcoming hard fork Pectra (Electra+Prague) will introduce two new operation codes: AUTH and AUTHCALL. Together, these codes make up Ethereum Improvement Proposal number 3074 (EIP-3074).\n\nThe two codes are easy to understand. AUTH delegates power to an Invoker to conduct transactions while AUTHCALL calls that prior authorization to conduct subsequent transactions using that authorization.\n\nIncredibly \u2014 and for the first time in Ethereum\u2019s history \u2014 these two codes allow a third-party entity to send or transact Ethereum assets, including NFTs and ERC-20 tokens like USDC, inside your wallet forever. Unless developers modify the EIP before Ethereum hard forks later this year, the delegated powers remain with the Invoker permanently.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Foundation ditches \u2018warrant canary\u2019\n\nEIP-3074 gives wallet makers even more power\n\nAlthough further details of the AUTH and AUTHCALL codes are quite technical, a final item of general importance to most crypto participants is EIP-3074\u2019s entrusting of unprecedented powers to wallet makers.\n\nBecause Ethereum developers realize the expansive and permanent power of AUTH instructions to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), they have decided to limit the EOAs to which users may delegate their assets. Specifically, they have proposed limiting EOAs to a whitelist maintained by pre-approved wallet providers like MetaMask.\n\nThe solution to this blockchain problem? Trusted third-parties.\n\nEIP-3074: Trust us, bro.\n\nChainArgos CEO Jonathan Reiter explained Invokers\u2019 newfound powers in EIP-3074 even more explicitly, saying, \u201cI delegate authority over my account to an Invoker \u2014 something that can now call code over my assets \u2014 and that thing now has the ability to do stuff with my assets. And there\u2019s no way to revoke that delegation\u2026 The problem here is, because you can\u2019t revoke it, if I delegate to a contract \u2014 even if I think that contract is okay today \u2014 if it\u2019s upgradeable, they can steal my tokens in the future.\u201d\n\nSecurity researchers and auditors have raised similar concerns. Indeed, it\u2019s not enough for the user to simply ensure that they delegate only to presently trustworthy EOAs. If those EOAs are upgradeable smart contracts, the owner of those EOAs\u2019 private keys could swap honest code for malicious code in the future.\n\nWorse, even if an EOA is immutable, if that EOA interacts with additional smart contracts and those third-party smart contracts are upgradeable, EIP-3074 could expose users\u2019 assets to theft via malicious, third-party code upgrades in the future.\n\nRead more: Blast L2 hack prompts debate over centralization of Ethereum rollups\n\nWhy are we further empowering the most powerful?\n\nGiven all of these risks, what exactly is the point of EIP-3074 in the first place? Mostly, in the opinion of co-author Matt Garnett, the code will save users time and money \u2014 assuming Invokers stay honest. Consider a first-timer\u2019s experience using Uniswap. First they must manually sign to authorize Uniswap. Then they need to pay to activate ETH on Uniswap before signing up and paying gas to activate USDC. Then they sign and pay gas to swap ETH for USDC and if more assets are involved, each one must also be activated with a separate signature and gas fee.\n\nIn the post-Pectra hard fork world, many of these signatures and gas payments could consolidate. For the user, they would only sign once to AUTH an Invoker with permission to perpetually trade their ETH or USDC on their behalf \u2014 without subsequent signatures.\n\nIn summary, EIP-3074 adds more trust and power with centralized and already quite powerful corporations like MetaMask by Consensys. Unless developers rethink this software change, the upgrade will entice users to entrust perpetual authority with third-party Invokers. These entities may now control users\u2019 wallets and might, by way of their own or third-party smart contract upgrades, change the rules of the game in the future to simply steal users\u2019 money.\n\nGot a tip?

        "title": "Solana vs Ethereum: will SOL's growth threaten ETH dominance? - OKX",
        "content": "With teams debuting their shiny new crypto projects every other week, navigating the world of crypto can be overwhelming for newcomers to the space. As you start to build a long-term, high-conviction trading strategy, it's likely you'll be researching prolific projects at the forefront of blockchain technology.\n\nOf today's crypto market leaders, two similar technologies that deserve exploring are major Layer 1 players Solana and Ethereum. As both Solana and Ethereum represent established Layer 1 blockchains backed by passionate communities and vibrant ecosystems, it can be difficult to separate the two given their strengths and unique selling points.\n\nEager for clarity? This guide aims to provide an objective comparison of Solana vs Ethereum as we demystify their technical attributes and explore what differentiates them. From exploring how each Layer 1 blockchain fares against the blockchain trilemma to understanding their future developments, here's everything you need to know when comparing Solana and Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum is the first blockchain platform to popularize smart contracts and self-executing programs that power decentralized applications (DApps). The leap forward with autonomous smart contracts sparked a wave of development in the decentralized space and established Ethereum as a DeFi pioneer, where users can borrow, lend, and trade crypto without relying on traditional financial institutions. Beyond DeFi, Ethereum's robust ecosystem encourages fresh innovation across various sectors, ranging from NFTs and GameFi to real-world asset (RWA) marketplaces and prediction markets. Overall, Ethereum's established developer community, strong security measures, and ever-evolving feature set solidify its position as a leading force in the blockchain world.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nA next-generation blockchain that improves upon the innovations of its predecessors, Solana debuted in 2017 amid scalability bottlenecks and rose to prominence because of its Proof of History (PoH) function. By timestamping transactions in a decentralized manner, Solana nodes can organize transactions more efficiently, leading to rapid confirmation times and affordable gas fees. This makes Solana a haven for fast-paced DApps that demand high transaction throughput. Beyond speed and affordability, Solana boasts a vibrant developer community drawn to its user-friendly programming languages and its potential for on-chain scaling solutions. This dev-first focus has fueled the creation of innovative projects within the Solana ecosystem, including play-to-earn games with immersive experiences and serialized NFT projects that allow ongoing content updates.\n\nHow Ethereum and Solana fare against the blockchain trilemma\n\nBefore diving into our Solana vs Ethereum comparison, it's important to first understand the concept of the blockchain trilemma. In short, the blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin that suggests developers for decentralized blockchains will encounter three main factors: security, decentralization, and scalability.\n\nDespite their best efforts, developers will be forced to sacrifice one factor as a trade-off to meet the needs of the other two factors. One example of this would be Bitcoin. Known for its high level of security and decentralization, Bitcoin is often seen as the gold standard among decentralized networks. However, Bitcoin struggles with scalability, meaning it can only process a limited number of transactions per second. This is a major drawback for widespread Bitcoin mainstream adoption, as it can lead to slow transaction times and high fees.\n\nUltimately, understanding the blockchain trilemma is essential for evaluating different blockchain projects. Each project makes its own trade-offs between the three core principles mentioned above, and the ideal choice for you'll depend on your specific needs and priorities. Now that we have a clear understanding of the blockchain trilemma, let's dive into the security, decentralization, and scalability of Ethereum and Solana to see how these popular blockchains fare against such metrics.\n\nSecurity\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana prioritize security, employing robust mechanisms to safeguard user funds and network integrity. In both cases, validators stake their own tokens (ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana) to verify transactions. The potential loss of their staked tokens incentivizes validators to act honestly, as malicious behavior could result in penalties and loss of their stake. Ethereum's long history and battle-tested security measures inspire confidence in many users, but it's important to remember that security for any blockchain is an ongoing process, and vulnerabilities can still emerge. However, their approaches differ in their nuance of Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation. Ethereum's current PoS implementation is still under development compared to some established PoS blockchains, while Solana's PoS applies PoH alongside it.\n\nEthereum's security\n\nEthereum's current security relies on PoS, a consensus mechanism where validators stake their own ETH tokens to verify transactions. The potential loss of their staked tokens incentivizes validators to act honestly, as malicious behavior could result in penalties and loss of their stake. While the PoS implementation is a recent development, Ethereum's history with its previous Proof of Work (PoW) system and the ongoing security audits and improvements during its transition to PoS inspire confidence in its ability to protect user funds and network integrity. This established track record is a major advantage for users who prioritize a security model that's been thoroughly tested and refined over time.\n\nSolana's security\n\nSolana leverages a unique combination of PoH and delegated PoS (DPos) for security. PoH creates a verifiable record of time between transactions, preventing issues like replay attacks due to streamlined transaction ordering. Delegated PoS requires validators to stake not only SOL tokens but also Solana hardware, raising the potential cost of malicious activity. While Solana's security architecture is innovative and shows promise, its relative novelty compared to Ethereum's PoS system might lead some users to favor Ethereum's established track record.\n\nOverall, both Ethereum and Solana prioritize security with strong mechanisms to protect user funds. Ethereum's established track record with PoS inspires confidence in many users. However, Solana's innovative approach with PoH and bonded PoS offers additional security features and a potentially higher barrier to malicious actors. While Ethereum's PoS is well-understood, Solana's complex architecture with PoH may be less battle-tested, introducing the possibility of unforeseen vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the choice between these two platforms from a security standpoint depends on your individual risk tolerance and how you weigh a proven track record against advanced and disruptive features.\n\nDecentralization\n\nDecentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology. It refers to the distribution of power and control across a network, eliminating the need for a central authority. Both Ethereum and Solana aim for decentralization by applying the PoS consensus mechanisms. With PoS, validators who stake their own cryptocurrency tokens are responsible for verifying transactions. This economic incentive aligns validator interests with the health of the network, as malicious behavior could result in slashing and the loss of their stake. Additionally, both platforms aim to achieve a degree of resistance to censorship by distributing the validation process across a global network. This means no single entity can control or block transactions on the network.\n\nEthereum's decentralization\n\nThe Ethereum network is arguably one of the most decentralized in the world. With an estimated validator pool exceeding one million, Ethereum's validator base is constantly expanding, with plans to become even more distributed in the future. However, concerns remain about the potential influence of large staking pools that could hold a significant portion of the total staked ETH. As of writing, Lido dominates the staking landscape on Ethereum, controlling over 30% of staked ETH at one point. This concentration raises concerns about potential centralization, as Lido could potentially influence the network if it wanted to. Thankfully, the Ethereum team is actively working to mitigate this risk. The upcoming sharding upgrades as part of the Ethereum roadmap aim to further decentralize the network by increasing the number of validators required per shard. Overall, this will make it more difficult for any single entity to gain control, since the implemented upgrade will increase the number of validators required and lower the barrier to entry for individual stakers.\n\nSolana's decentralization\n\nAlthough Solana has been praised for its impressive throughput, its string of outages expose a potential vulnerability in this methodology. Solana adopts a different approach to decentralization and applies a DPoS system where validators are chosen based on factors like stake size and network performance. While this approach allows for faster transaction speeds, it also raises concerns about centralization as the validation power is concentrated among a smaller set of chosen validators.\n\nAdditionally, Solana's validator set is currently permissioned and employs a validator selection process with delegated PoS, meaning new validators need approval from the network to join. While this allows for faster transaction speeds, Solana's reliance on a specific set of validators for its PoH system raises questions about its true level of decentralization and reliability. This is especially true when compared to Ethereum's more geographically distributed validator network.\n\nThe perceived lack of reliability has also been underlined by Solana's network disruptions. To tackle this, Solana is working towards a permissionless validator set through its hotly anticipated validator client software, Firedancer. Firedancer implements Solana's version of PoS and aims to address some of the platform's current centralization concerns. By enabling anyone to run a validator node without prior approval from the network, Firedancer has the potential to significantly distribute validation power more evenly and greatly improve network decentralization in the long run.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Ethereum and Solana regarding decentralization depends on your priorities. If complete openness and permissionless participation are paramount, Ethereum might be the better choice despite its current scalability limitations. If faster transaction speeds are a priority, you might be willing to accept some centralization trade-offs with Solana, keeping in mind its ongoing efforts to become more decentralized in the future. However, if a technical issue or malicious attack disrupts the validator network, the entire Solana network can grind to a halt. This undermines the security and reliability of the platform, especially compared to more decentralized blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability refers to a blockchain's ability to handle a growing number of transactions without compromising processing speed or incurring high fees. This is a critical factor for the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as expensive gas fees are often a deterring factor when it comes to regular usage and transactions. Scalability presents a contrast between Ethereum and Solana as each network has its own way of dealing with high transaction volume.\n\nEthereum's scalability\n\nAlthough it's established with a robust ecosystem, Ethereum has historically struggled with scalability due to its previous PoW consensus mechanism. This resulted in numerous scalability bottlenecks such as high transaction fees and slow processing times, which were major pain points for users looking to actively interact with Ethereum's ecosystem. In fact, it's this bottleneck that inspired many developers to strike out on their own and create their own scalability-focused Layer 1 blockchain, leading to the innovations in blockchain scalability that we see today.\n\nFortunately, the Ethereum Foundation has been hard at work upgrading the network with improved scalability in mind. From its PoS transition to numerous network upgrades like Dencun, the developments aim to significantly improve scalability by distributing the workload across multiple shards, potentially handling thousands of transactions per second. With the execution of its roadmap, we could see Ethereum reach a single block finality of 12 seconds. This is a fraction of its current 30-minute duration, and achieving this will dramatically improve the user experience and network efficiency.\n\nSolana's scalability\n\nMeanwhile, Solana is a high-performance blockchain that prioritizes scalability from its core design. Since its inception, Solana has had a laser-like focus on speed. Thanks to the network's introduction of innovations like PoH and tower byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), Solana is theoretically able to achieve a blistering throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second. On top of this, Solana also boasts gas fees that are mere fractions of a penny, making it significantly cheaper to interact with the network compared to Ethereum's historically high gas fees.\n\nThe combination of blazing-fast transaction speeds and negligible fees puts Solana's scalability in a league of its own compared to Ethereum's current state, as Solana is becoming the platform of choice for a wide range of DApps, particularly those requiring high throughput and cost-effectiveness. While Solana has yet to achieve its theoretical maximum throughput, it's certainly on its way to hitting this thanks to progress made with Firedancer. With its ability to process 600,000 transactions per second in test environments, Firedancer could be influential in markedly improving Solana\u2019s overall scalability.\n\nWhen considering scalability between Ethereum and Solana, both networks offer compelling options for developers and users seeking a scalable blockchain platform. While Ethereum focuses on a robust ecosystem and future scalability improvements with a strong emphasis on decentralization, Solana prioritizes raw speed and boasts impressive transaction processing capabilities at a fraction of the cost. Ultimately, the choice between these platforms depends on the specific needs of the project or user, with factors like transaction speed, cost, desired level of decentralization, and application type playing a key role in the decision-making process.\n\nSolana's potential threat to ETH dominance\n\nFor those unaware, ETH dominance refers to the ratio between the market cap of Ether to the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market. Like with Bitcoin dominance, ETH dominance is often used to track Ether's value relative to other big-name cryptocurrencies. This is used to signify how ETH fares against the competition.\n\nA chart showing ETH dominance (source: tradingview.com)\n\nA chart showing ETH dominance (Source: tradingview.com)\n\nReferencing the chart above, we can see that ETH dominance is currently on a downward trend. This is based on how a recent death cross was formed on the daily time frame as the 50-day moving average recently crossed under the 200-day moving average. Additionally, the relative strength index shows that ETH dominance is declining from its current value of 44.1. With these indicators in mind, we can conclude that ETH dominance could decrease in the near future, hinting that there might be a relative increase in the value of altcoins as traders rotate out of ETH into promising crypto projects and altcoins like SOL. This trend has also been a huge reason why crypto traders have been speculating that Solana might threaten ETH dominance over time as it offers a faster, more scalable alternative with significantly lower transaction fees. This speculation is further fueled by the ongoing developments of Solana's Firedancer validator client software, which aims to address concerns about decentralization and news of how Solana recently overtook Ethereum in terms of DEX trading volume.\n\nThe future of Solana vs Ethereum: can both Layer 1 powerhouses coexist?\n\nThe competition between two leading Layer 1 blockchains like Solana and Ethereum is fierce. While Ethereum boasts a robust and established ecosystem with a strong focus on decentralization, Solana offers blazing-fast transaction speeds ideal for high-throughput applications.\n\nAs both platforms continue to evolve, one important question emerges: can both Layer 1 powerhouses coexist in the future blockchain landscape? The answer might lie in specialization. Ethereum's upcoming sharding upgrades could address its scalability issues while maintaining its focus on security and decentralization. This would solidify Ethereum's strong positioning for complex financial applications and trading TradFi instruments like RWAs. Conversely, Solana's speed advantage could make it the go-to platform for applications requiring real-time transactions, such as DeFi markets with frequent trading or high-traffic GameFi titles.\n\nBeyond competition, we've seen a rise in cooperation between Solana and Ethereum. Thanks to the rise of decentralized interoperability bridging services like OKX Swap, both Layer 1 blockchains can seamlessly communicate with one another and enable asset transfers. We've even seen the emergence of shared developer tools and cross-chain projects fostering a more collaborative environment. Ultimately, the future might see a scenario where both Ethereum and Solana thrive, catering to different user needs and fostering innovation within the broader, interconnected blockchain space.\n\nFinal words on Solana vs Ethereum\n\nMany would agree that Solana may be the best option if speed, scalability, and low fees are important to you. This will likely be the case if you're interacting with high-frequency DeFi applications where every millisecond counts, or if you frequently trade Solana memecoins. However, if a robust and battle-tested ecosystem with a strong focus on decentralization is your priority, Ethereum might be the better fit. This could be ideal for DApps requiring greater security for valuable assets or projects seeking a more established user base and compatibility with existing Ethereum-based DApps.\n\nUltimately, the best approach might not be a \"which is better\" scenario. As the industry continues to develop, we might see increased interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. This would allow users to leverage the strengths of each platform seamlessly. For instance, imagine seamlessly transferring assets between Ethereum and Solana for lower transaction fees while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network. The future of blockchain development is bright, with both Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana leading the charge. By staying informed about their ongoing advancements, you'll be well-positioned to make informed choices as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve.\n\nKeen to trade either Solana or Ether?

Solana boasts theoretical transaction speeds exceeding 65,000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum's current average of 15 to 45 transactions per second. This difference is due to Solana's unique architecture designed for scalability, while Ethereum is still undergoing upgrades to improve its speed.\n\nIs Solana cheaper than Ethereum?\n\nYes, Solana transactions typically incur significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum. Solana gas fees are a fraction of a penny, while Ethereum gas fees can fluctuate and sometimes reach high levels depending on network congestion.\n\nIs Solana more secure than Ethereum?\n\nWith its established and battle-tested network and a larger validator base that offers greater decentralization, Ethereum is generally considered more secure than Solana. This can also be seen in how often Solana faces network outages compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhy does Ethereum have higher TVL (total value locked) than Solana?\n\nTVL refers to the total value of cryptocurrency locked within DeFi protocols on a specific blockchain. Ethereum has a significantly higher TVL compared to Solana. This can be attributed to factors like Ethereum's first mover advantage that led to it having a more mature and established ecosystem. Specifically, Ethereum supports a wider range of DeFi applications and protocols, while the network effect could have caused the existing user base on Ethereum to attract further projects and users that reinforce its dominance in the DeFi space.\n\nCan Solana overtake Ethereum?\n\nThe future is, of course, uncertain. While Solana offers superior speed and lower fees as of writing, Ethereum is actively working on scalability improvements. Additionally, Ethereum's established ecosystem and user base are significant advantages. It's more likely that both platforms will coexist, with users choosing based on their specific needs. The rise of interoperability bridges could further enhance this coexistence by allowing users to leverage the strengths of each platform seamlessly."

It can be safe and simple way to earn rewards. Plus, you can stake any amount of ETH you have, and you don't need to worry about setting up complicated software. Although Coinbase doesn't charge a fee to stake or unstake, it charges a commission based on the rewards you receive from the network.

These rewards will be automatically reinvested into your staking balance. You can keep track of your rewards on the Coinbase staking page.\n\nUnstake ETH\n\nIf you want to unstake ETH, you can do so at any time.

While it collaborates with reputable validators, events like slashing can occur because of factors beyond Coinbase\u2019s control. Gas fees: Staking and unstaking transactions on the Ethereum network require gas fees, which can vary. These fees can impact profitability, especially for smaller stakers.\n\nHow Much Ethereum Do You Need to Stake on Coinbase?\n\nUnlike solo staking, where you usually need the full 32 ETH, Coinbase allows users to stake any amount of ETH. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH on Coinbase. This flexibility makes staking accessible to everyone, regardless of the amount of Ethereum they hold.\n\nHow Much Can You Earn Staking ETH on Coinbase?\n\nWhen staking Ethereum (ETH) on Coinbase in mid-April 2024, the estimated reward rate is approximately 2.61% if you stake for 365 days. This rate isn't fixed and can vary over time. You can check the latest applicable rates directly within your Coinbase account. Commission charges reduce your actual returns.\n\nRewards are distributed every four to five days after the activation period. However, the rewards may not settle in your account immediately because of network conditions. While the estimated reward rate gives you an idea of what you can earn, the actual rewards may take some time to reflect in your account.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Unstake ETH on Coinbase?\n\nTo unstake ETH on Coinbase, you follow a specific process. Once you initiate the unstaking action, your assets will enter an unbonding period. After this period ends, you can withdraw the asset. However, there's an additional step: unbonded assets must be included in a batch before withdrawal. You'll need to wait until the unbonding transaction is part of one of Coinbase's batch times.\n\nFor U.S. clients, batch times are Monday-Friday at 12:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. PST; and Saturday-Sunday at 2:00 p.m. PST. Non-U.S. clients have different batch times: Monday-Friday at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. GMT; and Saturday-Sunday at 4:00 p.m. GMT.\n\nUnstaking ETH on Coinbase involves an unbonding period followed by waiting for batch withdrawal times. Be aware of these timelines when planning to unstake ETH.\n\nCan I Sell Staked Ethereum on Coinbase?\n\nYou cannot directly sell staked Ethereum on Coinbase. You would go through the process of unstaking it first, which typically takes one to four days depending on network conditions. Once the unstaking transaction is processed, you'll be able to claim your funds and sell them.\n\nUnstaking and claiming are separate blockchain transactions, and both require gas fees, resulting in costs associated with both processes.\n\nIf you have staked Ethereum on Coinbase and want to move it, you have a couple of options. You can unstake it and sell it or you can wrap it into cbETH and trade it as a liquid staking token. However, cbETH trades at a discount, so if you're looking to sell at the full value of your staked Ethereum, unstaking and selling it may be the better option.\n\nCoinbase Stakers Earn Rewards\n\nStaking Ethereum on Coinbase offers a straightforward and accessible way for users to actively participate in the Ethereum network and earn rewards. With Coinbase's user-friendly platform, you can stake any amount of ETH, even as little as 0.01 ETH, without the need for a full Ethereum node. While there are potential risks and considerations to keep in mind, such as centralized exchange risks, commission charges and gas fees, the benefits of earning passive income, supporting network security and contributing to a more environmentally friendly blockchain ecosystem can make staking on Coinbase an attractive option for many investors."

The timeline, however, remains tentative, sources noted.\n\nHarvest Fund Management Co.\u2019s international division and a joint venture between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital are the two potential ETF issuers, Bloomberg\u2019s sources said.\n\nAs noted, the two entities plan to roll out their ETFs by the end of the month, pending approval from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and finalizing listing arrangements with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.\n\nThe report follows news earlier this week that prominent Chinese asset managers have applied for spot Bitcoin ETFs through their Hong Kong subsidiaries. According to Bloomberg, on April 9, SFC granted Harvest and China Asset Management clearance to provide virtual-asset-related fund management services.\n\nHong Kong Bitcoin ETFs poised to attract $25 billion\n\nThe potential approval of Hong Kong-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs could unlock up to $25 billion in demand from mainland China as qualified Chinese investors may be allowed to access the funds through the Southbound Stock Connect program, said Matrixport in a Friday report.\n\n\u201cA likely approval of Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin Spot ETFs could attract several billion dollars of capital as mainland investors take advantage of the Southbound Stock Connect program, which facilitates up to 500 billion RMB (HK$540 billion and $70 billion) per year in transactions,\u201d said Matrixport. \u201cBased on the (potential) available capacity, this might result in up to 200 billion Hong Kong dollars of available capacity for those HK Bitcoin ETFs\u2014or US$25 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Southbound Stock Connect program sets a yearly limit of HK$540 billion for Chinese investment in Hong Kong-listed stocks.

The move was seen as preparation for upcoming crypto ETF products."
