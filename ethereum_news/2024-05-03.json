        "title": "Ethereum: Long Term Bullish Pattern Ironically Has To Retrace In Order To Be Super Bullish - Investing Haven",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements present a paradox that might confuse the average investor. As Ethereum\u2019s price dips, it could, counterintuitively, signal a highly bullish future.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic requires a deep dive into the technical patterns that are currently forming on Ethereum\u2019s long-term charts. Chart analysis is one of our forecasting methods with which we try to predict ETH prices in 2024 & 2025.\n\nThe Current State of Ethereum\n\nLately, Ethereum has experienced a downward trend that has left many investors feeling uncertain. This decline is not just a reflection of market sentiment but also a pivotal development in the broader technical narrative of Ethereum\u2019s chart.\n\nThe price action, which can seem disheartening at first glance, might actually be setting the stage for a major bullish pattern: the cup and handle.\n\nETH \u2013 Why a Move Lower is Bullish\n\nThe concept might seem contradictory at first \u2014 how can a decrease in price be a good thing for investors? The answer lies in the pattern itself. A cup and handle formation is recognized in technical analysis as a bullish continuation pattern that often leads to a breakout.\n\nFor Ethereum, this pattern begins with a \u201ccup\u201d formation, which the cryptocurrency has been crafting through its recent highs and lows.\n\nThe \u201chandle\u201d part of the pattern, which Ethereum is potentially beginning to form now, typically involves a slight downward or sideways movement in price following the cup. This movement is crucial as it consolidates earlier gains and builds a base for the next upward surge. For the pattern to be validated and for the bullish implications to be activated, Ethereum must not fall below a critical support level \u2014 in this case, $2,250.\n\nETH \u2013 The Importance of the $2,250 Support Level\n\nThis support level is more than just a number. It represents a key psychological and technical threshold that must hold for the cup and handle pattern to complete correctly. If Ethereum\u2019s price respects this support level during its current retrace, it will likely solidify the handle portion of the pattern and set the stage for a significant bullish breakout.\n\nStrategic Considerations for Ethereum Investors\n\nFor those looking to capitalize on Ethereum\u2019s potential, here are some conditions and strategies to consider:\n\nMonitor the $2,250 Support Level: This is the line in the sand for the bullish scenario to remain intact. A sustained movement below this price could invalidate the bullish setup and necessitate a reassessment of your investment approach. Understand the Pattern\u2019s Timeframe: The cup and handle formation is a longer-term pattern. Patience is required, as the development and completion of this pattern can span several months. Prepare for Volatility: The path to higher prices is rarely smooth. Prepare for potential volatility as Ethereum tests these crucial levels. Consider the Broader Market Context: While Ethereum\u2019s individual price movements are crucial, the broader market context, including regulatory news and macroeconomic factors, can also significantly impact price action. Set Clear Investment Goals: Whether you\u2019re looking for short-term gains or long-term growth, understanding your own investment goals and risk tolerance is crucial. This clarity will guide your decisions amidst market uncertainty.\n\nConclusion\n\nIronically, Ethereum\u2019s recent price retracement might be exactly what is needed to propel its price to new heights. By respecting the critical support level and forming a complete cup and handle pattern, Ethereum is not just performing a technical maneuver but is also setting the stage for a potential major bullish trend in the future. For savvy investors, this period is not just about weathering the storm but recognizing the opportunities that such patterns may present."

        "title": "Ethereum Lead Dev Shares Crucial Message on Account Abstraction - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nEther developer Yoav Weiss has shared some notes on Ethereum\u2019s road map for account abstraction.\n\nLately there's a lot of chatter about the road to full account abstraction. I wrote some notes on what we've been building and how it gets us to full AA.https://t.co/UYEM0e5QLX \u2014 yoav.eth (@yoavw) May 3, 2024\n\nIn his post, Weiss gives a detailed overview of ERC-4337, what led to its development as well as Ether team\u2019s future plans.\n\nWhat is ERC-4337?\n\nThe ERC-4337 standard enables smart contract crypto wallets on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing user experience with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concept, introduced by the Ethereum team led by Vitalik Buterin, aims to transition assets exclusively to smart contracts rather than externally-owned accounts (EOAs).\n\nERC-4337 introduces a \"pseudo-transaction\" object called a UserOperation, facilitating transactions on behalf of users and stored in an \"alt mempool\" until confirmation. This initiative marks a significant step toward improving the usability of Ethereum for dApps and smart contract interactions.\n\nBrief history\n\nWeiss discussed the origins and evolution of ERC-4337, highlighting the journey from Vitalik Buterin's initial proposal to the current focus on standardizing account abstraction (AA) across Layer 2 (L2) networks.\n\nThe development stemmed from the realization of wallet fragmentation due to custom implementations of AA by various L2 networks, prompting the need for a protocol-level standard like ERC-4337.\n\nThe road map now includes Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs), notably RIP-7560, aimed at facilitating the migration of L2 chains to native AA. RIP-7560 is being refined into separate optional RIPs to streamline the implementation process and address specific use cases like validation, 2D nonces, aggregation and EOA (externally-owned accounts) enhancements.\n\nFuture\n\nThe current focus has predominantly been on L2 adoption, but there's acknowledgment of the value in implementing AA on Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1). The plan is to gradually transition L2 chains to RIP-7560 while Ethereum L1 continues with ERC-4337, ensuring compatibility and a smooth migration process over time.\n\nWeiss emphasized the importance of collaboration with L1 core developers, L2 developers, and the broader community to refine RIP-7560 and ensure a successful implementation across both Ethereum L1 and L2.\n\nFeedback from developers working on the Ethereum Object Format (EOF) is particularly sought to optimize the clean separation between protocol and user-facing aspects in RIP-7560.\n\nButerin's take\n\nVitalik Buterin outlined four main goals for an account system revamp on Ethereum, emphasizing the need for key rotation and deprecation, quantum resistance, batching and support for sponsored transactions.\n\nHe highlighted the limitations of Ethereum's current end user account (EOA) model in achieving these goals, underscoring the necessity to transition the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem toward smart contract accounts (SCAs).\n\nButerin expressed a desire to avoid creating two separate developer ecosystems for smart contract wallets and EOAs, emphasizing the importance of cohesion and interoperability within Ethereum's development landscape.\n\nThe Ethereum core developers have recognized the importance of delivering incremental feature upgrades to enhance user experience in the short term, while simultaneously advancing a longer-term road map for Ethereum's evolution."

        "content": "MicroStrategy executive chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor believes the SEC will classify Ethereum as a security this summer and reject the related spot ETF applications filed by various asset managers, including BlackRock.\n\nSaylor made the prediction in a social media post on May 2 during a presentation at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference. He further predicted that other cryptos \u201cdown the stack\u201d will also gain an unregistered security designation, including BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA).\n\nSaylor said:\n\n\u201cNone of them will be wrapped by a spot ETF, none of them will ever be accepted by Wall Street\u2026\u201d\n\nSaylor instead asserted that Bitcoin (BTC) alone has full institutional acceptance. He called BTC the \u201cone universal\u201d institutional-grade crypto asset and said \u201cthere won\u2019t be another one.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s founder is well-known for his exclusive focus on Bitcoin. Saylor\u2019s statements come days after MicroStrategy said it added $1.65 billion of BTC to its corporate holdings in the first quarter and alongside the announcement of its Bitcoin-based decentralized identity (DID) product.\n\nCritical ETH decisions\n\nAlthough the market was initially optimistic about the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, the expectations have fallen dramatically in the last few weeks, with Polymarket placing the odds of approval at a meager 11% as of press time. Analysts similarly revised their expectations from more than 80% chance of approval to less than 30%.\n\nThe critical date for the SEC\u2019s decision is May 23, at which point it must decide on VanEck\u2019s proposed ETF. The regulator is expected to decide on other similar applications simultaneously.\n\nThe SEC may also need to state whether ETH is a security. The blockchain development company Consensys intends to compel the SEC to state ETH is not a security in a legal case. US lawmakers have also asked for clarity on the matter in relation to another company, Prometheum.\n\nA clear designation for ETH could provide companies with a definite way to handle the asset. However, such a designation could also affect whether the SEC approves certain products, such as a spot ETF, and whether companies work with ETH without proper registration.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Make a Massive Recovery on Friday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A bad jobs report was good for crypto today.\n\nAfter a week of lower trends, Bitcoin (BTC -3.41%), Ethereum (ETH -2.30%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -7.20%) jumped in trading on Friday morning.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Bitcoin was up 4.1% versus yesterday's stock market close, Ethereum had risen 2.6%, and Dogecoin was up 5.6%. And they all moved based on the same piece of information.\n\nUnemployment data and crypto\n\nCrypto values jumped the moment the U.S. Labor Department released April 2024 jobs data. The U.S. added 175,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9%.\n\nEconomists were expecting 235,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 3.8%.\n\nThere can be revisions to initial data, but the market will often react solely to the headline report. And that's exactly what happened with the crypto market's reaction only seconds after the report was released.\n\nDoes unemployment really impact crypto?\n\nThe question is really about what this news has to do with cryptocurrencies. Many market participants think a worsening economy means the Federal Reserve will lower rates more quickly. Current expectations are for a September rate cut, but there may be no rate cuts this year if inflation remains high.\n\nIt's a balance to keep rates higher if the economy weakens because lower rates can be a catalyst for more economic activity.\n\nI also question whether or not rates really have much of an impact on cryptocurrencies at all. Outside of more speculation, lower rates don't have any fundamental impact on the crypto market in most instances.\n\nHigher rates are bad for the crypto meme\n\nWhile Bitcoin has solidified its position as a form of digital gold and Ethereum is commonly known as a more utility blockchain with many scaling solutions, Dogecoin could be the most sharply impacted if rates stay where they are and the economy gets worse.\n\nDogecoin is a meme coin with no real utility and that meme position will be tough to hold if people have fewer funds to spend on speculative assets. I think that explains the reaction today.\n\nThis is part of the normal volatility of the crypto market, but it also highlights that eventually, the meme that started in 2020 may not hold much water.\n\nCaution in crypto today\n\nThe crypto market has been on a tear in 2024 despite higher interest rates and signs the economy is getting weaker. And there was also the tailwind from the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S.\n\nBut some of the market's tailwinds may be subsiding and that won't be good for valuations long term unless there's a significant increase in the utility of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is getting more expensive after the most recent halving and Ethereum hasn't proven to be very cost-effective either.\n\nDogecoin has very little utility and has been focused on its meme status, which can come and go.\n\nI think a day like this is a time to take some chips off the table in crypto as the market telegraphs there are weaker fundamentals for the economy ahead. Like it or not, the economy and the Fed are still the biggest drivers of crypto long term."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, May 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nIn the midst of recent turbulence in the crypto markets, characterized by a brief spell of uncertainty, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have emerged as beacons of resilience, surging to new heights. However, amidst this soaring trajectory, Furrever Token (FURR) has ignited a fresh wave of excitement by unveiling a lucrative opportunity for investors: the chance to pocket a substantial $10,000 reward. As BTC and ETH continue their upward ascent, the allure of FURR's enticing competition adds an extra layer of intrigue to the already exhilarating world of cryptocurrency investing.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Rockets Towards $62,000 Amidst Renewed Bullish Momentum\n\nAmidst a recent tumultuous period for the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) is staging an impressive rebound, surging by nearly 5% to reach around $61,857.26. This resurgence follows a sharp dip below $57,000, with BTC climbing 5.2% over the last 24 hours. Market analysts are closely eyeing the critical $62,000 level, identified as a key resistance point on BTC's daily chart. While some traders anticipate a bullish breakthrough, others caution against a strong rejection, emphasizing the significance of sustained volume and candlestick closure above this threshold.\n\nTechnical indicators and on-chain data suggest various levels of resistance and potential targets, with some analysts eyeing $82,000 as the initial objective. With signals of bullish momentum strengthening, Bitcoin's price action continues to draw attention, with a possible bull flag formation on the weekly chart signaling further upward potential towards all-time highs and beyond.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Regulatory Hurdles as SEC Decision Looms\n\nAmidst a backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced at around $3,081.29, marking a 3.5% increase since yesterday. As the deadline for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approaches, industry experts express skepticism regarding approval. Analysts like Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor doubt the likelihood of approval for Ethereum Spot ETFs this May. Three prominent applicants, VanEck, Ark 21 Shares, and Hashdex Nasdaq, face hurdles as the SEC scrutinizes underlying securities issues, potentially leading to postponements rather than outright denials.\n\nConcerns are raised that Ethereum may be classified as a security by the SEC, a move that could impact not only Ethereum but also other major cryptocurrencies and ETF applicants. In contrast, Hong Kong's crypto market experiences significant growth, with nearly $300 million in weekly inflows following the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This divergence from the U.S. market, where spot Bitcoin ETFs face notable outflows, underscores the shifting dynamics of global crypto investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token (FURR): A Whimsical Journey Through Presale Success and Cute Crypto Innovation\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) is poised to captivate investors and accelerate through its remaining presale stages, leveraging a unique blend of charm and innovation. With a mission to infuse the crypto space with a delightful dose of cuteness, FURR transcends traditional use cases, offering users an irresistibly charming experience.\n\nIn a market dominated by serious blockchain projects, FURR stands out by fostering a warm and friendly community centered around the universal appeal of adorable cat imagery. The tokenomics of FURR are designed to incentivize participation, with 65% of tokens available during the presale, creating ample opportunities for early investors to secure their stake in this whimsical ecosystem. Moreover, the team's commitment to transparency and longevity is evident through the allocation of 10% of tokens, locked for a year, reassuring the community of their dedication.\n\nThe launch on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like PancakeSwap further enhances accessibility and liquidity, ensuring a seamless experience for investors. Held on the Gleam platform, the competition spans 7 days, offering participants the opportunity to accumulate points by completing various tasks. At the end of the frenzy, three lucky winners will each walk away with a share of the $10,000 prize pool in FURR tokens. The stakes are high, with the first-place winner bagging $5,000 worth of FURR, followed by $3,000 for second place and $2,000 for third place. The competition kicks off on 02/05/2024 at 12:00 pm (UTC +1) and concludes on 09/05/2024 at 12:00 pm (UTC +1), so rally your purrfect skills and join us for a chance to claim your spot among the ultimate Furrever winners!\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\n\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Bonanza Competition\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\n\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nEthereum is now on the path to recovery after a retracement on the weekly timeframe. ETH touched the $3,000 price level today, indicating buyers\u2019 return.\n\nWhale activity has increased again amid the price recovery, with more than 36,000 ETH tokens moved. Will this affect Ether prices?\n\nEthereum Whale Movement Influencing Ether\u2019s Price\n\nAccording to the on-chain analytics platform Whale Alert, 36,763 ETH has been moved in the past day.\n\nA whale address transferred 25,772 ETH to Coinbase Institutional, a major crypto exchange, and another whale acquired 10,990 ETH from Coinbase within the same period.\n\nThese transactions coincide with Ethereum\u2019s fluctuating prices, which has sparked mixed sentiments among market participants.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price has increased slightly today, trading at $2,980 as of 5:37 AM EST, with a 1.4% 24-hour increase. The monthly charts suggest the token has entered a consolidation phase, marked by high fluctuation around the $3,000 price level.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Decision Likely to Affect its Price\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the spot Ethereum ETF approval by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a major factor affecting Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nWhile enthusiasts are keen on approval, MicroStrategy\u2019s CEO, Michael Saylor, is critical of an Ethereum ETF. According to Saylor, Ethereum is a security. Hence, the SEC would never approve an ETF for the altcoin.\n\nThis assertion by Saylor comes just 20 days away from the final ETH ETF deadline of May 23. The SEC will either approve or reject a request for an Ethereum ETF on that date.\n\nAlso, Saylor believes that other altcoins such as BNB, SOL, Cardano, and XRP will be classified as unregistered securities. He noted that Bitcoin stands alone in attracting institutional acceptance, and there is no second-best token.\n\nWhile opinions are divided on an Ethereum ETF approval, a positive response will likely attract more investors. If the ETFs are approved, Ethereum will likely record a massive rally.\n\nHowever, nothing is certain yet, and a decline is imminent for Ether should the SEC decline the spot ETH ETF approval.\n\nWhat Next for Ethereum?\n\nETH has formed a red candle on the daily chart after rallying to $3,000 earlier today. The sellers have continued to mount pressure, forcing a decline at the $3032.8 resistance level.\n\nHowever, ETH has found support at the $2938.2 price level, which is critical to preventing further decline.\n\nThe Parabolic SAR indicator has moved above the candles, a bearish signal of further decline. This confirms the bearish signal displayed by the RSI, which sits at 39.08, approaching the oversold region.\n\nGiven the upcoming spot ETF decision and the current mixed market sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s price is at a critical conjecture. It could remain consolidatory in the coming days until a decision is reached, which will either propel it upwards or trigger a downturn.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price is yet to continue its uptrend following a rejection from the $4,000 resistance level. But the bulls are now showing signs of strength, perhaps staging a more considerable recovery.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAs the daily chart depicts, Ethereum\u2019s price has been making lower highs and lows inside a descending channel since failing to break above the $4,000 resistance level.\n\nYet, the cryptocurrency is climbing back above the $3,000 level and the midline of the channel. If the market successfully recovers back to these levels, a breakout above the channel and a continuation toward $4,000 and even higher prices can be expected.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour chart offers a much clearer picture of recent price action. The market has barely broken through the $3,000 resistance zone and is currently testing the midline of the descending channel.\n\nWith the RSI showing values above 50%, ETH is likely to break through the level and potentially continue outward to the $3,600 resistance area. In this case, market participants can be optimistic that a new bullish wave will begin soon.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rates\n\nFollowing the recent decline in Ethereum\u2019s price, many futures traders have been liquidated or reversed their long positions. This can be a good sign, as the futures market has seemingly cooled down.\n\nThis chart demonstrates the Ethereum funding rates metric, which measures whether buyers or sellers are executing their futures orders more aggressively (using market orders). Positive values point to bullish sentiment, while negative ones show bearish expectations.\n\nIt is evident that the funding rates have significantly dropped compared to a couple of months ago. Low but positive funding rates can be interpreted as a bullish signal, as they show that while the futures market is not overheated anymore, the demand is still there, and the price can soon rally higher."

        "content": "Despite a weekly pullback in Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory, the world\u2019s second-largest crypto by global market cap has once again sparked substantial investor attention. Today, on May 3, Ethereum\u2019s price not only regained an upward momentum but also surpassed the significant $3K mark, a positive development that has reinvigorated the market, instilling a sense of optimism among investors.\n\nThis upward trend, coupled with a considerable spike in whale activity, has ignited a flurry of interest surrounding the token\u2019s future price movements. Nearly 36,000 ETH was shifted over the past day, with whales dumping and buying and buying the so-called \u2018eternal Solana rival\u2019 token in hand.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH Whale Activity: A Closer Look\n\nInsights from on-chain analysis platforms reveal that a total of 36,762 ETH was moved in the past day. Notably, whale 0xf83c\u2026 made a significant move by transferring 25,772 ETH to Coinbase Institutional, a prominent player in the crypto industry. In contrast, whale 0x0b4\u2026 acquired 10,990 ETH from Coinbase during the same period, showcasing contrasting strategies.\n\nThese transactions, coming in tandem with Ethereum\u2019s recent turbulent price action, have ignited mixed sentiments within the broader crypto market. While one whale continued to buy the token amid a broader market dip, the other whale dumped colossal amounts of the same token, underscoring a bearish sentiment amid ETH\u2019s status as a security saga.\n\nNonetheless, the price trajectory\u2019s upward movement at press time skewed the scale more toward the optimistic side.\n\nAlso Read: Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block Boosts Its Bitcoin Bet With 10% Gain Reinvestment\n\nETH Price Jumps\n\nAs of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price jumped 3.08% in the past 24 hours and currently sits at $3.001. The token witnesses a high price flux movement at the $3K mark, with its monthly charts illustrating a consolidatory phase.\n\nCrypto market enthusiasts continue to extensively eye the token for further price action shifts as the security lawsuit and a post-BTC halving rally remain poised to impact the token\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that XRP, a Ripple Labs-backed token, has been on a sluggish price trajectory ever since it entered a legal tussle with the U.S. SEC. On the other hand, a post-halving rally usually pushes a parabolic uptrend in altcoins as well, historical data suggests, although it\u2019s not always a guarantee of future price movements.\n\nAlso Read: Michael Saylor Attacks Ethereum Calling It A Security, Disapproves spot ETF\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Fri 03 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAs the price of Ethereum continues its decline, dipping below the $3,000 mark, investors\u2019 interest in the second-largest crypto remains strong. What are the factors that attract investors to ETH despite the price drop?\n\nEthereum falls, but investors keep flowing in\n\nDespite a 3% loss in 24 hours and a drop below $3,000, the Ethereum network exhibits an unprecedented dynamic. According to Santiment, the 28th and 29th of April saw the creation of 266.6 million new wallets, setting a record since October 2022.\n\nThis massive influx of new users reflects a strong confidence in the long-term potential of ETH, beyond short-term volatility. \u201cThe expansion of the network is a key indicator of crypto adoption,\u201d emphasizes John Smith, an analyst at Santiment.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of Santiment data shows that retail investors have particularly taken advantage of the price correction to enter the market. Addresses holding between 0 and 0.1 ETH have increased significantly, while those with more than 1 ETH have scaled back their positions.\n\nThis trend indicates a keen interest from individuals in ETH, whose capital inflows could support a short-term rebound. Many of these new investors are likely attracted by the returns of ETH staking.\n\nStaking, an attractive yield in bearish times\n\nThe rise of staking on Ethereum entices more and more investors who seek to stake their ETH to generate attractive returns. According to Glassnode data, the total ETH staked has reached 44.24 million, representing 36% of the circulating supply.\n\nMeanwhile, the ETH supply on exchanges continues to decline, to 12.79 million tokens, about 10% of the total. \u201cMany prefer to stake their ETH to earn returns rather than leave them lying dormant on exchanges,\u201d analyzes Wilson.\n\nThe Ethereum is going through a rough patch, but its network has never seemed as robust. The massive arrival of new users enticed by the yields of staking heralds a bright future for ETH, despite market fluctuations.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Market picture\n\nCrypto market capitalisation rose 3.3% in 24 hours to $2.22 trillion. Local capitalisation bottomed near $2.10 trillion, confirming a sequence of declining local lows (2.3 in March, 2.25 in April) and highs (2.76 in mid-March, 2.67 in early April and 2.46 in late April).\n\n\n\nEthereum and Solana are adding from the area of the April lows and forming a double bottom. This is a positive but not too reliable signal, as Bitcoin has been in a downtrend throughout April.\n\n\n\nAfter the halving, it is logical to expect miners to increase sales from inventory, to invest in new capacity or to lock in profits. Also, the hype around spot Bitcoin ETFs is going away, which reinforces selling by speculators.\n\n\n\nAssuming Bitcoin stays within the global growth cycle starting in 2023, we should expect further price declines in the coming weeks. The nearest likely target looks to be the $51-52K area, where growth was paused in February and where the 200-day MA will be pulled up by the end of the month.\n\nNews background\n\nSoSoValue notes that outflows for $563.8 million from spot bitcoin-ETFs on 1st May reached their highest since product approval. Bloomberg noted the formation of IBIT and FBTC price discounts relative to net asset value (NAV).\n\n\n\nBlackRock believes that financial institutions, including pension, endowment, and sovereign wealth funds, will enter the ETF market in the coming months.\n\n\n\nVanEck calculated that the aggregate value of Bitcoin in the wallets of governments and companies is $175bn. That\u2019s about 15% of the total BTC capitalisation.\n\n\n\nBitfinex said that Bitcoin options traders are preparing for a summer lull in the market. Summer is usually a period of low volatility in the crypto market. Cube.Exchange, on the other hand, pointed to the likelihood of increased price fluctuations in the summer against a background of low liquidity.\n\n\n\nToncoin (TON) resumed growth after a correction amid an investment from venture capital firm Pantera Capital with over $5bn in assets under management. \u2018We believe TON has the potential to bring crypto to the masses as it is widely used in the Telegram ecosystem\u2019, Pantera noted.\n\n\n\nOn 2nd May, TON developers announced the platform\u2019s integration with the on-chain analytics service Arkham Intelligence. On 1st May, integration with the cross-chain platform Layerswap was implemented, which, according to its representative, will make it possible \u2018to send USDC from any network and receive USDT on the TON blockchain\u2019."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nEthereum (ETH) is witnessing extraordinary network growth, representing a landmark development. Simultaneously, altcoins such as THORChain (RUNE) or KangaMoon (KANG) are gaining ground within the crypto industry. Many analysts claim that KANG, now in Stage 5 of its presale, is the next $1 altcoin in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Outstanding Network Growth\n\nEthereum (ETH) has recently made headlines in the crypto market. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this altcoin has witnessed its biggest network growth in the past 12 months. Notably, Glassnode shows that around 139,560 new ETH addresses were created on April 29.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price movement saw a jump of 62% in the past year alone, with a market cap of $356B. Moreover, the Ethereum crypto is now trading above its 100\u2014and 200-day EMAs, while nine technical indicators are flashing green. Because of this, experts predict that Ethereum will soar to $3,775 before Q2 of 2024 ends.\n\nTHORChain (RUNE): Over $10B in Trading Volume\n\nMeanwhile, THORChain (RUNE) has also made some waves in this space. For instance, THORChain announced that March 2024 was the first month with over $10B in trading volume. This milestone is significant as it shows the level of attention that this altcoin is getting.\n\nThe THORChain price surged 280% on the YTD chart, and its market cap rose to $1.65B. Furthermore, the THORChain coin is trading above its 100\u2014and 200-day EMAs. As its RSI sits at 60, experts remain bullish. They foresee RUNE reaching a value of $6 within Q2 of 2024, making it one of the altcoins to watch.\n\nKangaMoon (KANG): An Upcoming Member of the Top 10 Altcoins\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) is rapidly gaining popularity as an altcoin. Many traders are drawn to it thanks to its stellar presale performance. For example, KangaMoon has obtained over $6M, with projections of it reaching $7M before May 2024 ends. Additionally, 20,000 registered community members and 6,000 holders of this altcoin.\n\nThe Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming industry is expected to hit $885M in 2028, which presents a good opportunity for KangaMoon. Because of this, it will create a P2E game where gamers will use the KANG token as an in-game currency. In other words, gamers can use this altcoin to buy in-game items, access challenges for extra tokens, and more.\n\nKangaMoon also focuses on its community. For example, KangaMoon is now awarding its most active community members free KANG before the presale ends. Thus, traders rush to like and share KangaMoon\u2019s social media posts to earn this altcoin for free.\n\nKANG is now in Stage 5 of its presale and is worth just $0.0196 \u2013 a 290% pump from its starting price of $0.005. However, experts are bullish about KANG since it is so early in its development. They forecast a pump to $1 once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in Q2 of 2024. With this price prediction, KANG emerges as one of the best altcoins to buy.\n\nWill KangaMoon Provide Faster Returns Than Ethereum and THORChain?\n\nAt a low $19.6M market cap, KangaMoon might bring faster returns than Ethereum or THORChain. This is because it needs less new money flow to increase prices. As a result, KangaMoon could become one of the top 10 altcoins in 2024.

Progress will be slow and painful though, but such is life. Advertisement May 3, 2024\n\nIn response, Yakovenko acknowledged challenges while maintaining a positive outlook. He emphasized the platform's resilience and its ability to navigate obstacles over time. Despite acknowledging Solana's own hurdles, such as the Ore mining incident and ongoing spam issues, Yakovenko remained steadfast in his defense of Ethereum's potential.\n\nThe conversation expanded to comparisons between Ethereum and Solana, with Yakovenko highlighting Solana's technical achievements, particularly its transaction throughput, in contrast to ETH's scalability solutions.\n\nInterestingly, a similar situation has happened in the past, but in reverse. After the FTX crash at the end of 2022, Solana (SOL) faced serious skepticism from all sides, and many have already buried the blockchain. However, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, expressed his faith and support for the project, which as a result marked the bottom of the SOL token price at that time."

        "content": "Sat 04 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum is distinguished by an operation of remarkable audacity in the crypto sphere: the burning of 12.7 billion dollars\u2019 worth of ETH. This strategic move, far from being a mere supply reduction, reveals a profound vision and a commitment to the stability and longevity of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum and the Reduction of Its Crypto Supply\n\nThe burning of ETH, implemented following a major upgrade of Ethereum thousand days ago, involves the destruction of a portion of the transaction fees.\n\nThis process no longer rewards the miners with these fees, but rather removes them from circulation, inducing a notable deflationary effect.\n\nTo date, approximately 4.3 million ETH have been eliminated, marking a decisive shift in the platform\u2019s monetary policy.\n\nThis reduction in supply aims to increase the scarcity of the ETH crypto, which, theoretically, could support or increase its value in the market.\n\nComparable to stock buybacks in the financial world, this strategy can promote an appreciation of the price, thereby offering investors an opportunity for gain, provided the demand remains stable or increases.\n\nThe crypto market\u2019s reaction to this massive burn has been predominantly positive, interpreted as a sign of maturity and responsibility on the part of Ethereum\u2019s developers.\n\nBy controlling inflation and reinforcing user trust, Ethereum solidifies its position as a leader among alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nEconomic and Technical Implications\n\nThrough this burn, Ethereum also improves the security and stability of its network. This makes a majority control less attractive in a Proof of Stake framework. Thus, the ETH crypto becomes more resistant to manipulation attempts, ensuring greater reliability for large-scale transactions.\n\nThe burning process also acts as a catalyst for innovation. By adjusting its economic structure, Ethereum encourages developers to design cost-optimized decentralized applications (dApps), promoting the emergence of new uses and functionalities within the ecosystem.\n\nIn the long term, this strategy could redefine the economic landscape of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum positions itself as a technological platform and a strategic economic player, positively influencing its own economy and that of the sector more broadly. Meanwhile, the rush of investors continues.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "title": "Solana takes on Ethereum as \u2018DEX war\u2019 takes new turn - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Activity on Jupiter, Solana\u2019s biggest DEX, trumped Ethereum-based Uniswap\u2019s numbers\n\nETH\u2019s volume remained higher than SOL\u2019s, while JUP and UNI sentiment differed\n\nJupiter, a decentralized exchange built on the Solana blockchain, has overtaken Uniswap as the DEX with the highest number of Unique Active Wallets (UAWs). AMBCrypto noticed this after looking at data from DappRadar.\n\nAt press time, UAWs on Jupiter exchanges were over 205,000. Uniswap, built on Ethereum [ETH], had less than 170,000.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nUAW measures the crypto-wallet addresses that interact with a network or applications. If the metric increases, it implies a rise in user activity. On the other hand, a decrease suggests dwindling attention.\n\nAs can be seen below, Jupiter\u2019s active wallets rose over the last 24 hours while Uniswap\u2019s declined. However, this is not just about the DEXs mentioned. Instead, it speaks more of the competition between Solana and Ethereum.\n\nFor years, Ethereum dominated Solana on this front. However, this cycle has been different, and there are reasons attached to it too. For starters, Solana has been the chain producing most of the top memecoins.\n\nWhile a few have appeared on the Vitalik Buterin-developed blockchain, it has not been able to match Solana. For instance, you could mention dogwifhat [WIF], Bonk [BONK], and Popcat [POPCAT] as some of the memecoins that have grown incredibly on Solana. On the other hand, PEPE seems like the only major one that has come out of the other.\n\nBeyond the emergence of tokens, another factor that has played a part is the transaction fees. Investigations revealed that the cheap fees Solana offers has helped with retaining traders. Though fees on Ethereum are now lower than before, it\u2019s still nowhere close to what Solana\u2019s fees are.\n\nSimply put, the DEX takeover happened as a result of a combination of these factors.\n\nThat being said, on-chain data also revealed that Ethereum\u2019s volume is still much higher than Solana\u2019s.\n\nETH, UNI, overtake SOL, JUP on some fronts\n\nAt press time, Solana\u2019s volume was $3.32 billion. Ethereum, on the other hand, registered a figure of $12.39 billion. On the price front though, SOL led ETH in terms of growth.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL was changing hands at $139.03 \u2014 A 537.65% hike in the last 365 days. Within the same period, ETH\u2019s price appreciated by \u2018just\u2019 61.10%.\n\nShould this performance remain the same in months to come, then SOL could topple ETH all through this cycle. However, it is important to note that the DEXs mentioned have their native tokens too.\n\nFor Jupiter, the ticker is JUP. Uniswap\u2019s UNI is more popular as it is a lot \u201colder\u2019 than the former. At the time of writing, JUP\u2019s price was $1.02, representing a 75.53% hike in the last 90 days.\n\nMeanwhile, UNI changed hands at $7.08 following a 14.54% hike within the same period. Regardless of the price action though, the Weighted Sentiment of Solana-based JUP was negative.\n\nEthereum-based UNI was in the green, indicating that market participants are more bullish on it than JUP. However, sentiment without action might not affect prices as JUP might continue to outperform UNI.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s SOL\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nFor Ethereum and Solana, the battle might not stop anytime soon. Ergo, participants might need to keep an eye out for developments on their respective blockchains."

        "title": "Ripple CEO Reiterates XRP & Ethereum Not Securities, Slams SEC\u2019s Gary Gensler - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made a bold statement amid the ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In his latest statement, the Ripple CEO not only backed XRP but also extended support to Ethereum (ETH) as the token vs. securities controversy escalated. In addition, he slammed the SEC and its Chairman Gary Gensler.\n\nRipple CEO Backs XRP & Ethereum\n\nDuring a Fireside Chat alongside Arrington Capital Founder Michael Arrington, Garlinghouse made a scathing remark against the SEC. According to a post on X by Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett, the Ripple CEO said that the SEC is \u201cgrossly wrong.\u201d Moreover, Garlinghouse went on to deem SEC\u2019s Gensler as an \u201cunethical human being.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nFurthermore, he noted that both XRP and Ethereum are not securities. This comes after almost four years of the Ripple vs SEC court battle and the newly initiated Consensys vs SEC lawsuit. The Consensys lawsuit demands the regulatory agency to consider that Ethereum is not a security.\n\nHowever, the SEC had already once classified Ethereum as a security, which has led to contradiction in their current statement. Meanwhile, netizens have weighed in on the matter with some supporting Consensys, including the Ripple CEO. However, former Ethereum advisor, Steven Nerayoff, labeled Ethereum as a security and deemed it as an \u201cundeniable\u201d fact.\n\nAlso Read: XRP Price Prediction: XRP Eyes Major Reversal as Buyers Step In at $0.48\n\nXRP Vs SEC Case Update\n\nRipple\u2019s forthcoming response to the lawsuit marks a significant milestone, especially after the SEC opposed their motion regarding the Fox Declaration. The SEC contends that the Fox Declaration merely provides a summary of XRP institutional sales rather than expert analysis.\n\nMoreover, they argue its admissibility under the law, likening it to the previously submitted Ferrante Declaration. However, Ripple is expected to challenge any assertions of financial harm stemming from the declaration.\n\nWhilst, Judge Sarah Netburn issued a scheduling order concerning Ripple Labs\u2018 motion to strike the new expert evidence the SEC submitted. This evidence supports the SEC\u2019s claim for remedies and a final judgment, which could entail Ripple paying nearly $2 billion in penalties.\n\nFurthermore, following the SEC\u2019s opposition on April 29, Ripple has three business days to file its reply as per Judge Netburn\u2019s order. Legal experts note the SEC\u2019s vigorous response, yet maintain that Ripple\u2019s argument remains pertinent unless the financial records\u2019 summary is contested.\n\nDespite Ripple\u2019s stance, the SEC maintains that Fox\u2019s declaration lacks personal opinion and merely reflects counsel\u2019s instructions to assess potential pecuniary harm among institutional buyers.\n\nAlso Read: 400M XRP Just Unlocked From Escrow, Is XRP Price About To Skyrocket?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "BTC and ETH traded below their maximum pain points, suggesting that traders might face severe losses\n\nImplied Volatility dropped, implying a lack of bullish expectations going forward\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] options contracts worth about $2.3 billion are set to expire on Friday, 3 May. According to Deribit Exchange, the Bitcoin options are valued at $1.35 billion. ETH contracts, on the other hand, are worth $990 million. The value of these contracts seems to be lower than the figure AMBCrypto reported last week \u2013 $9.3 billion.\n\nThe decline could be attributed to the price action of both cryptocurrencies. For most of the week, BTC and ETH recorded severe declines before recent appreciation. As a result, traders have been cautious about opening more positions.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s put/call ratio (PCR) was 0.50. This ratio gauges the overall market mood. A PCR higher than 1 suggests that traders are buying more puts than calls\u2014 A sign of bearish sentiment.\n\nAnarchy looms as traders gear up for results\n\nHowever, if the PCR is lower than 0.70, it implies more calls than puts, meaning that the broader sentiment is bullish. Simply put, the reading suggests that traders expect Bitcoin to end the week stronger than how it started.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the maximum pain point was $61,000 on the charts. This means that if Bitcoin drops to this price, most options traders will suffer intense losses.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, its PCR was 0.37, implying that there were more bullish bets than bearish ones. The maximum pain point for ETH was $3,000. As such, traders might need to hope that the altcoin trades above this level before the day ends.\n\nAt press time, both Bitcoin and Ethereum were valued at levels below the max pain point. If this remains the case by the time the contracts expire, the day could be a \u201cred one\u201d for many traders.\n\nThere are a few reasons why BTC and ETH might end the week on a bearish note. Greeks.live, the notable Options trading handle on X, explained,\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong ETF listing failed to bring much incremental volume, the US BTC ETF continued to flow out, the weakness of the market led to weakening market confidence. The current point of sustained sideways trading is unlikely, no rebound is bound to be a downward relay, the giant whale on the lack of confidence in the market.\u201d\n\nVolatility falls: Will BTC and ETH follow?\n\nIn addition, AMBCrypto looked at Bitcoin\u2019s Implied Volatility (IV). The IV shows the level of confidence in the market, and if it would be a good idea to buy call/put options going forward.\n\nIf the IV increases, market participants are uncertain where the next prices might move. However, if the metric declines, it means traders are unwilling to pay an additional fee to safeguard their existing positions.\n\nGiven the price of Bitcoin and ETH, the IV declined, suggesting that traders have been uncertain that their bullish bets would pay off.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nShould this sentiment play out, ETH\u2019s price might slip below $2,900 again. For BTC, it might start trading at a lower value than $59,000 again."

The transferred supply was worth $5.8 million at prevailing market prices. The participant received the ETH at 31 cents per token as part of the ICO.\n\nThe purpose of the transfer was yet to be ascertained, at the time of writing. However, there could be several explanations behind the move, with the most dominant narrative being realization of profits. At current prices, the investor would lock a humongous 950719% in profits.\n\nOther factors could be diversifying their portfolios for other tokens.\n\nNot the first time\n\nSimilar instances of reactivation of old ETH received during Genesis were seen earlier in the year. On 24 March, for instance, a participant moved the entirety of their 2,000 ETH received during the ICO. Before that, a wallet transferred 1,732 ETH to crypto-exchange Kraken on 2o February.\n\nAMBCrypto investigated further using Santiment data and spotted sharp spikes in the movement of ETH that were inactive for more than five years. In nearly all the instances, the movement of dormant coins was followed by a price drop. This finding lends weight to the profit-taking theory discussed earlier.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHow\u2019s the sentiment around ETH?\n\nAt press time, ETH was wiggling in the range around $3,000, according to CoinMarketCap. The second-largest cryptocurrency seemed to be recovering from a rough last month during which it plummeted by nearly 10%.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, sentiment around the coin in the Futures market shifted dramatically too.

        "content": "The markets are tumultuous and difficult to read. Old guard tokens like Ethereum (ETH) are outperformed by utility coins like BNB, while meme coins are the rising crypto stars, outperforming nearly anything else. Pepe and Raboo are both on the receiving end of BNB\u2019s stellar performance, and investors would do well to consider meme coins over and above utility coins like BNB.\n\nBNB (BNB): The Utility Coin That Keeps On Giving\n\nBull market, bear market, flat market, who cares when BNB is around? The beauty of BNB is that it is the utility token of the largest crypto exchange, and no matter what the market conditions, it is in use. Whether you are investing or divesting, when trading on Binance, chances are BNB is involved, and this is why BNB is the fourth-largest coin by market cap.\n\nBNB has gone from a \u2018mere\u2019 utility coin into a bona fide store of value. With a market cap of over $80 billion, BNB is a giant and has outperformed Ethereum by a factor of three in the last year alone.\n\nPepe Coin (PEPE): The King of The Memes (for now).\n\nOne of the top rising crypto of the year is Pepe Coin. Dismissed as just another meme coin, Pepe Coin silenced its critics with a breathtaking 400% return in year-to-date figures \u2013 and that is after the market recovered after the March spike in prices! Pepe Coin is nobody\u2019s fool, and if Ethereum is outpaced by utility coins like BNB, then it stands no chance against the juggernaut gains meme coins like Pepe Coin and its cohorts can deliver, and have continually delivered, to the cryptosphere.\n\nThe future of Pepe Coin looks as bright as can be now that the crypto market is seeing the goodwill and purchasing power meme coins have on offer. Pepe Coin is hardly alone in this, and the rising crypto stars are almost all meme coins.\n\nRaboo (RABT): Capturing Hearts as a Rising Crypto and Meme Coin\n\nRaboo is not just any cryptocurrency; it\u2019s a new meme-fi AI crypto carving out its niche as a rising crypto and one of the most engaging meme coins on the market. What\u2019s the allure of meme coins, you ask? They\u2019re fun, relatable, and resonate with a digital audience that loves to blend humor with investments.\n\nRaboo takes this a step further by integrating cutting-edge AI to keep the memes fresh and the community laughing and earning. As it continues to gain traction, highlighted by a smashing $1 million in presale funding, Raboo proves that investing can be both enjoyable and profitable. It\u2019s not just about numbers; it\u2019s about being part of a community that celebrates creativity and innovation in the crypto world.\n\nConclusion:\n\nRegarding investments, one can either be stuck in the mud and stick with the lumbering giants like Ethereum, or one can get on board with the fast and agile rising crypto tokens like BNB, Pepe Coin, And Raboo. Nobody is investing to lose money, and the massive returns on utility and meme coins far outpace the bigger names. Raboo (RABT) is available in presale at $0.0042 and Pepe Coin and BNB are available to trade on the markets.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here."

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s next price target \u2013 ETH can climb to $3,300 ONLY if\u2026 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price appreciated by more than 2.5% in the last 24 hours\n\nMost metrics and market indicators looked bullish on ETH\u2019s charts\n\nAs market sentiment changed over the last few hours, Ethereum [ETH] benefited from the same as its daily chart turned green. However, the latest uptick might just be the beginning of a massive rally, especially since the king of altcoins\u2019 price is now moving inside a bullish pattern.\n\nEthereum\u2019s bullish move\n\nThe last 7 days weren\u2019t in the investors\u2019 best interests as ETH\u2019s price dropped by over 5%. However, as the market trend changed, ETH also managed to push its price up by more than 2.5% in 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,988.30 with a market capitalization of over $358 billion.\n\nInterestingly, things might get even better for ETH in the coming days. World of Charts, a popular crypto-analyst, recently shared a tweet highlighting that the ETH/BTC pair was moving inside a falling edge pattern. A successful breakout from the pattern could result in ETH hitting new highs in the coming months.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto checked ETH\u2019s metrics to see whether it would manage a breakout. Our analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s network growth hiked over the last few days. Simply put, more addresses were created to transfer the token as its active withdrawal rate climbed last week.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s supply held by top addresses also rose slightly, suggesting that buying pressure on the token was high.\n\nOn the contrary, its MVRV ratio remained low. At press time, ETH\u2019s MVRV ratio had a value of -6.22%.\n\nEthereum\u2019s weekly target\n\nSince most metrics seemed bullish, AMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s daily chart to see whether a further uptrend was inevitable.\n\nWe found that ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered a sharp uptick from the neutral level. The Money Flow Index (MFI) also went north. Both of these indicators suggest that the chances of a sustained bull rally are high.\n\nOn the other hand, the MACD supported the sellers as it flashed a bearish crossover on the charts.\n\nWe then analyzed Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to find out the possible targets ETH might hit this week if the bull rally lasts. In order for ETH to sustain the rally, it will be crucial for the token to go above $3,100, as liquidations would rise sharply.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nA hike in liquidations could result in a price correction. A successful breakout above that level could allow ETH to climb to $3,300 by the end of this week if everything falls into place."

        "title": "Ethereum NFTs on Blast \u2013 Should ETH holders worry now? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Blast overtook Ethereum in terms of NFT volume\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s price fell, network growth and velocity grew significantly on the charts\n\nEthereum [ETH] has largely been dominant in most sectors across the crypto-space. On a certain front, however, it would seem that the tides have shifted in favor of the Blast network.\n\nNFTs on full Blast\n\nRecent data suggests that over the last 24 hours, Blast NFT collections like PAC REKT, Blastopians, and Plutocrats have collectively generated more volume than the entire Ethereum NFT market across all exchanges.\n\nNow, even though Blast outperformed Ethereum in terms of NFT volume, a significant portion of this volume can be attributed to wash trading. For context, Wash trading in NFTs inflates trading volume by buying and selling between controlled wallets, creating fake popularity, and misleading investors. It undermines the NFT market by distorting prices and reducing real liquidity.\n\nEven though a large part of Blast\u2019s NFT volume can be due to wash trading, the declining interest in Ethereum NFTs does raise concerns about the state of the network. In fact, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that the number of NFTs being traded has fallen significantly.\n\nTaking a deeper look\n\nNFT collections on other networks such as Bitcoin and Mythos managed to outperform Ethereum NFTs. According to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, popular Ethereum NFT collections such as BAYC and Crypto Punks were not able to get into the top 5 most sold NFTs over the last month. The number of Crypto Punk buyers fell by an alarming 20%, whereas the number of BAYC buyers fell by 2.78%.\n\nIf this trend continues, Ethereum may lose its top spot in the NFT sector soon.\n\nETH holders bleed\n\nAs far as ETH\u2019s price is concerned, at press time, it had climbed back above $3,000 on the back of Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. Additionally, the network growth for ETH continued to rise as well.\n\nRising network growth is a sign that new addresses have been showing interest in ETH. Velocity climbed too, implying a surge in transaction activity on the Ethereum network.\n\nRising interest from new addresses and growing velocity could help ETH see green and push the altcoin to the levels it was trading at prior to the latest market correction.\n\nHowever, the size of the addresses showing interest in ETH will also play a key role in Ethereum\u2019s future price movement.\n\nFor instance, addresses holding 100-10,000 ETH were declining at press time, according to Santiment\u2019s data. Substantial purchases made by large addresses can play a huge role in ETH\u2019s price trajectory in the future.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator"

        "title": "Michael Saylor Attacks Ethereum Calling It A Security, Disapproves spot ETF - CoinGape",
        "content": "MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has made a bold statement against Ethereum stating that the world\u2019s largest altcoin is a crypto asset security and not a commodity. His comments regarding ETH came on Thursday, May 2, while speaking at the MicroStrategy World 2024 conference.\n\nMichael Saylor Attacks ETH\n\nIn addition to attacking Ethereum and calling it a security, Michael Saylor added that there\u2019s a very high likelihood that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would never approve a spot Ethereum ETF. His comments come just 20 days ahead of the final deadline of May 23, for the SEC to either approve/deny the spot Ethereum ETf applications.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe went on to forecast that other cryptocurrencies further down the hierarchy would also be classified as unregistered securities, including BNB, Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA).\n\nSaylor emphasized:\n\n\u201cNone of them will be included in a spot ETF, none of them will ever gain acceptance on Wall Street\u2026\u201d\n\nHe firmly asserted that Bitcoin (BTC) stands alone in achieving full institutional acceptance. He labeled BTC as the \u201csingular universal\u201d crypto asset suitable for institutional-grade investments, stating that \u201cthere won\u2019t be another one.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s founder is renowned for his unwavering focus on Bitcoin. Saylor\u2019s remarks come shortly after MicroStrategy announced the addition of $1.65 billion worth of BTC to its corporate reserves in the first quarter.\n\nTwo days before, MicroStrategy also unveiled its Bitcoin-based decentralized identity (DID) product MicroStrategy Orange. Along with holding a large stash of BTc on its balance sheet, the company has also been making strong efforts in order to boost the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFuture of Ethereum ETFs in the United States\n\nWhile some of the top financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity have been pushing for a spot Ethereum ETF, market analysts have toned down their expectations of approval recently. One of the major concerns has been the recent comments from the SEC that seek to treat it as a security.\n\nHowever, some of the top crypto industry firms are willing to defend Ethereum at all costs. Last week, ConsenSys slapped a lawsuit on U.S. SEC, and wants to declare it as a non-security.\n\nAs the SEC\u2019s investigations into Ethereum unfold, it\u2019s evident that spot Ethereum ETFs may face obstacles in the near future, potentially leading to further legal battles.\n\nSpot market Ethereum ETFs would offer Wall Street firms and investors a means to gain indirect exposure to ETH, bypassing the need to navigate crypto exchanges or manage digital wallets. Earlier this week, Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction to approve a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

With the integration, Shibaswap would operate on both the Ethereum [ETH] and Shibarium networks.\n\nThe ecosystem\u2019s primary token SHIB was trading at $0.00002245 as of this writing, up 6.4% in the last 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nBone ShibaSwap [BONE], ShibaSwap\u2019s governance token, also got a 5.76% hike in the 24-hour period.\n\nBig boost for ShibaSwap\n\nSince its launch in July 2021, ShibaSwap has been functioning on the Ethereum blockchain as a DEX, offering services like staking, liquidity pools, and yield farming.\n\nThe platform has handled trades worth more than $17 billion as of this writing, AMBCrypto noted using DeFiLlama data.

        "content": "ETH briefly broke support and traded at a low of $2852 on the 1st of May.\n\nIts Futures Open Interest declined considerably since the 10th of April.\n\nEthereum [ETH] recently crossed below its 20-day simple moving average (SMA), putting it at risk of a further decline in the short term.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s price falls below its 20-day SMA, it suggests that the short-term trend for the asset is downward.\n\nMarket participants often view this as a sign that sellers are in control and that the asset\u2019s price will likely continue declining.\n\nReadings from ETH\u2019s price movement on a 1-day chart showed that its price fell below its 20-day SMA on the 30th of April.\n\nAs coin selloffs intensified, ETH broke support and closed the trading session on the 1st of May at a low of $2850.\n\nBulls are nowhere to be found\n\nAlthough the coin\u2019s price retraced in the last 24 hours to exchange hands at $2,913 at the time of press, bullish pressure remains too weak to sustain any significant rally in the short term.\n\nAMBCrypto found that on the 1st of May, ETH\u2019s MACD line (blue) intersected its signal line (orange) in a downtrend when the coin\u2019s fell broke below support.\n\nThis intersection is a bearish sign. Both lines below the zero line, when it occurred, confirmed the existing downtrend and signaled the possibility of a further decline in ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAlso confirming the strength of the current market downtrend, ETH\u2019s Aroon Down Line (blue) was 92.86% as of this writing.\n\nThis indicator identifies an asset\u2019s trend strength and potential trend reversal points in its price movement.\n\nWhen the Aroon Down line is close to 100, it indicates that the downtrend is strong and that the most recent low was reached relatively recently.\n\nFurther, ETH\u2019s key momentum indicators pointed to a significant decline in demand for the altcoin. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 36.46, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 33.96.\n\nThe values of these indicators showed that market participants favored ETH distribution over the accumulation of newer coins.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of ETH\u2019s network activity using a 30-day average confirmed the decline in demand for the altcoin in the last month.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, the daily count of addresses involved in at least one ETH trade in the last month has dropped by 7%.\n\nSimilarly, the number of new addresses created to ETH has decreased in the last month. On-chain data showed that this has fallen by 10% in the past 30 days."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have resurged in price following a rough week caused by speculation over an important Federal Reserve meeting and its outcome as regards interest rates in the United States.\n\nAccording to Decrypt, Bitcoin price at the time of writing this report was around $57,700 after having made a 0.5% recovery in the past 24 hours. And the Ethereum price, after climbing 2.3% in the past day, is now trading for just below $3,000,\n\nNotwithstanding, the damage to the crypto market has already been done as the past 24 hours witnessed another $193 million worth of crypto futures contracts liquidated, adding to the $300 million worth of liquidations seen earlier this week.\n\nEconomist, Trader, and Crypto Analyst Alex Kruger explained the complexities of this current cycle and how it feels different for traders because it\u2019s largely been driven by interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which only just started trading in January this year.\n\n\u201cThere has been barely any new retail coming into crypto,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s been mostly ETF buyers and previous cycle participants redeploying and going out the risk curve.\u201d\n\nAnalysts explained the crash in crypto prices to be caused by fear in the market by investors over certainty among investors that the Federal Open Markets Committee would not lower interest rates. Then the Feds proved them right by leaving interest rates unchanged affecting crypto prices.\n\nDuring a press conference yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the fight to get inflation to 2% has been difficult, and he seriously doubts the next decision on the policy rate will hike it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reassured the American populace in a press conference in Japan that he is confident that there would be a rate cut before the year is out.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nBitcoin hit its highest price of $65,000 last month on the significant halving weekend and has steadily declined ever since.\n\nBitcoin has fallen below its $60,000 and one of the major reasons is a recent disinterest in the crypto asset by investors due to its inability to profit from the tension in the Middle East.\n\nRecommended reading: Ethereum surges 8%, highest ever increase in over a month"
