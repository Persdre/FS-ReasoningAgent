But with the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, many investors are left wondering, is Ethereum a good investment?\n\nIn this guide, we will delve into the factors that make Ethereum an attractive investment option, as well as the potential pitfalls to look out for. Whether you are a seasoned investor or a curious beginner, gaining insights into Ethereum's investment potential can help you navigate the complexities of the digital currency market.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: An Overview\n\nEthereum is not a cryptocurrency \u2014 it\u2019s a global computer for running decentralized apps (dApps). Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency that powers the Ethereum network, and it's the required form of payment for running your app or processing your transaction on the highly-desired Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is really good as a store of value, it doesn't support smart contracts like Ethereum does. Arguably, Ethereum is equally capable as a store of value. This being said, many prefer bitcoin to store value because of its hard-capped supply. While both the supply of Bitcoin and Ether are increasing, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin in circulation. With Ethereum 2.0 and EIP-1559 however, Ether may become deflationary, that is, the supply of the token will actually decrease with time.\n\nEther has been competing with Bitcoin for the top spot as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization since its release in 2015 and came close to overtaking Bitcoin in February 2018. Both of these coins have hit new all-time highs since then, and there appears to be more room for both to grow in 2024. Some experts predict Ethereum will \"flip\" Bitcoin this market cycle to become the dominant cryptocurrency in the industry.\n\nHow Ethereum Has Performed Since Launch & in 2024\n\nEthereum has had a volatile price history since its launch in 2015. In its early days, Ethereum was trading at just a few dollars per coin. However, during the cryptocurrency boom of late 2017, Ethereum reached a high price of over $1,400. In Nov. 16, 2021, it reached an all-time high of $4,891.70. Since then, Ethereum's price has fluctuated significantly, driven by factors such as market speculation, technological developments, regulatory news and overall market sentiment.\n\nHow Did Ethereum Perform in 2023?\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum performed exceptionally well, experiencing significant growth in its value and market capitalization. The implementation of Ethereum 2.0 brought about scalability improvements and lower transaction fees, making the platform more efficient and attractive to investors and developers. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications also boosted Ethereum's performance, as more projects were built on its blockchain. Overall, Ethereum solidified its position as a leading smart contract platform and continued to show strong growth potential.\n\nHow Much is Ethereum Right Now?\n\nAs of Jul. 18, 2024, Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $3,406.85\n\nEthereum Price Prediction\n\nPrice predictions are not always accurate, but a Ethereum price forecast can highlight potential investment opportunities. Benzinga has compiled important information regarding ETH future prices to address questions about whether Ethereum will rise in value. Discover ETH price forecasts here.\n\nWhere to Buy Ethereum\n\nDecided you want in on the Ethereum action? Listed below are a handful of exchanges where you can purchase Ether. If you're new to crypto, jump to our guide on How to Buy Ethereum or compare exchanges with the Best Cryptocurrency Exchanges guide.\n\nAdvantages of Ethereum\n\nThe overwhelming performance of Ethereum has attracted traditional and institutional investors alike. Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies provide you with the following advantages over traditional investments that point to Ethereum being a good investment:\n\nVolatility: While this was previously seen as a negative, smart investors have realized market cycle patterns and are able to capitalize on the parabolic gains produced by market bubbles.\n\nWhile this was previously seen as a negative, smart investors have realized market cycle patterns and are able to capitalize on the parabolic gains produced by market bubbles. Liquidity: Ethereum is arguably 1 of the most liquid investment assets due to the worldwide establishment of trading platforms, exchanges and online brokerages . You can easily trade Ethereum for cash or assets like gold instantly with incredibly low fees. The high liquidity associated with bitcoin makes it a great investment vessel if you\u2019re looking for short-term profit. Digital currencies may also be a long-term investment due to their high market demand.\n\nLower inflation risk : Unlike world currencies \u2014 which are regulated by their governments \u2014 Ethereum has a transparent inflation plan that is subject to less meddling. The blockchain system is infinite, and there\u2019s no need to worry about your crypto being deflated.\n\n: Unlike world currencies \u2014 which are regulated by their governments \u2014 Ethereum has a transparent inflation plan that is subject to less meddling. The blockchain system is infinite, and there\u2019s no need to worry about your crypto being deflated. Decentralized finance : Ethereum and DeFi are relatively young \u2014 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and many other new applications are becoming more mainstream on a daily basis. This newness brings unpredictable swings in price and volatility, which may create opportunities for massive gains.\n\n: Ethereum and DeFi are relatively young \u2014 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and many other new applications are becoming more mainstream on a daily basis.

Finality : The consensus mechanism of a blockchain ensures the integrity and security of the transaction record. Ethereum offers customizable consensus methods such as RAFT and IBFT for enterprise networks, which provide quick transaction finality and require less infrastructure than the Proof of Work algorithm.\n\n: The consensus mechanism of a blockchain ensures the integrity and security of the transaction record. Ethereum offers customizable consensus methods such as RAFT and IBFT for enterprise networks, which provide quick transaction finality and require less infrastructure than the Proof of Work algorithm. Tokenization: Ethereum enables businesses to represent any digitally registered asset as a token. By tokenizing assets, companies can diversify their product offerings (e.g. unique paintings), develop new incentive models, as well as fractionalize previously large assets (e.g. real estate) and allow for crowdsourced data management.\n\nDisadvantages of Ethereum\n\nEthereum may play a part in the future of monetary exchange and global computing systems, but it is equally important that you are aware of the concerns surrounding cryptocurrency investing. However, a few are certainly overblown (or will be fixed soon) and mistakenly make some investors think that Ethereum is a bad investment.\n\nVolatility: If you happened to buy Bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000. Weeks later, you couldn\u2019t sell your investment for more than $7,051. Although you would be doing great now, to avoid painful losses in the short term, keep a close eye on the market. This isn't a unique disadvantage for Ethereum as all cryptos (except for some stablecoins) are volatile so this alone doesn't make Ethereum a bad investment by any means..\n\nIf you happened to buy Bitcoin on December 17, 2017, the price was $20,000.

This isn't a unique disadvantage for Ethereum as all cryptos (except for some stablecoins) are volatile so this alone doesn't make Ethereum a bad investment by any means.. High transaction fees : Arguably Ethereum's largest drawback, transaction fees, hold back the network from reaching mainstream adoption. Using Ethereum's blockchain can cost hundreds of dollars, so retail investors with smaller amounts of capital are priced out from using the network. While other smart contract blockchains have cheaper fees, Ethereum has the most applications and use cases built on its blockchain.\n\n: Arguably Ethereum's largest drawback, transaction fees, hold back the network from reaching mainstream adoption.

New regulation: The government is unlikely to let cryptocurrencies remain completely unregulated for long. New regulations could interfere with business models, and cause crashes that are entirely out of your control.\n\nThe government is unlikely to let cryptocurrencies remain completely unregulated for long. New regulations could interfere with business models, and cause crashes that are entirely out of your control. Threat of online hacking : Hacks are a threat facing many cryptocurrency investors. Most exchanges let you buy and sell your cryptos using a mobile app or website. However many users also store their crypto on exchange wallets. This leaves them susceptible to losing their investments should the exchange get hacked, and their private keys being stolen. Cryptocurrency held on most exchanges isn\u2019t insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\n: Hacks are a threat facing many cryptocurrency investors.

Competition: There are a ton of emerging smart contract platforms giving Ethereum a run for its money, namely Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and Polkadot. While these cryptocurrencies offer better scalability than ETH, they lack decentralization and the robust DeFi ecosystem that Ethereum has on its network.\n\nThere are a ton of emerging smart contract platforms giving Ethereum a run for its money, namely Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and Polkadot. While these cryptocurrencies offer better scalability than ETH, they lack decentralization and the robust DeFi ecosystem that Ethereum has on its network. Proof of Work consensus: Although Bitcoin also uses proof of work consensus, this is more of a con for Ethereum. Transactions on Bitcoin are only necessary to transfer the crypto, while Ethereum's network is used for a variety of functions. Proof of work is more expensive and slower than proof of stake, which is currently being used by many ETH competitors.\n\nEthereum Trading Signals\n\nIntoTheBlock provides a fantastic suite of fundamental and technical trading signals to help you make your own informed decision on whether Ethereum is a good investment or not.\n\nHow to Store Ethereum Safely\n\nSo, is Ethereum a good investment? It can be if you do your research, manage your coins properly and keep an eye on the market. Crypto investing is not as simple as calling a broker and buying or selling. You are actively involved in the process, and that means you need a wallet. Cryptocurrency wallets are a fundamental part of the ecosystem, giving you the ability to easily send and receive money.\n\nThere are two types of wallets: software and hardware. MetaMask and Exodus Wallet are typically the best route to go for software wallets, and the Ledger Nano X is the best hardware wallet.\n\nBZ Pro Tip: If you lose access to your wallet\u2019s private key, whatever cryptocurrency was associated with the wallet is now lost forever. The best way to prevent this, is to handle your private key and seed phrase with extreme care. A forgotten seed phrase can remove currency from circulation forever. A memorized seed phrase can carry billions of dollars across borders with 0 physical evidence.\n\nEthereum NFTs\n\nA key driver for Ethereum's blockchain is the rise of NFTs. Almost every high-value NFT is secured by Ethereum's blockchain, including CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Art Blocks. Many new users on Ethereum were drawn to its network to invest in NFTs, so if NFTs continue to breach into the mainstream, it's likely Ethereum will continue to gain adoption. While other platforms like Solana and Avalanche have NFTs, the market for non-fungible tokens on these blockchains is magnitudes smaller than that of Ethereum.\n\nDisclaimer: Do not take out a loan to invest in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Do not purchase them with credit. Do not do anything that could endanger you or jeopardize your financial future. If you aren\u2019t sure how much risk you are capable of handling, consult a financial advisor who is trained for this.\n\nEthereum vs. Other Investment Options\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have completely different use cases. Bitcoin acts as a store of value, similarly to gold. Ether acts as a store of value too, while the Ethereum Virtual Machine enables a host of innovative applications such as DeFi, NFTs and the metaverse.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine allows coders to write programs called \u201csmart contracts.\u201d Ethereum smart contracts can automate thousands of financial products and are the building blocks of NFTs. These smart contracts enable full-fledged applications like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs).\n\nWhile very basic smart contracts are technically possible on Bitcoin's blockchain, Ethereum's custom programming language and huge team of developers make it the likely long-term settlement layer. Bitcoin's blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger for processing payments. Ethereum is a ledger with a full computer attached, allowing much, much more than just processing payments.\n\nAs far as which of the two is a better investment, it's impossible to say for sure. It\u2019s likely that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will stand the test of time and coexist peacefully in the future. Bitcoin is ahead now but Ethereum seems to be the clear winner in terms of utility though it is generally more volatile. At the end of the day, your investment decisions must be made by you (or an investment advisor). The best thing you can do is to educate yourself as much as possible before risking any of your hard-earned money, and never invest money you aren\u2019t willing to lose entirely. You don't want to end up on the front page of Wall Street Bets, after all.\n\nShould You Invest in Ethereum?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum can be a risky but potentially rewarding venture. As one of the largest and most established cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has a strong community and a wide range of use cases beyond just digital currency. Its smart contract functionality has enabled the development of decentralized applications and other blockchain innovations. However, like any investment, there are risks involved, including market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. It's important to do thorough research and understand your risk tolerance before deciding to invest in Ethereum.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ Does Ethereum have a future? A Ethereum\u2019s future looks promising with the implementation of Ethereum 2.0, the rise of decentralized finance applications, and the recent adoption of ETH ETFs. Its scalability, security, and adaptability make it an attractive choice for users and developers in the blockchain space. Q How do you mine Ethereum? A Ethereum is an unregulated digital currency that can be mined effectively by most modern graphics cards (GPUs). Mining Ethereum is actually quite simple, and can generate passive income for people with low electricity costs. Q Can Ethereum reach 100k? A According to Changelly, Ethereum could hit $100,ooo by 2033.\n\n***Information is not intended for U.S. users"

        "title": "What\u2019s Next for Ethereum ETFs Following SEC Approval? - Foley & Lardner LLP",
        "content": "Following the approval and launch of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (EFTs) in January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved eight Ethereum ETFs for listing and trading on SEC-regulated exchanges on May 23, 2024. The approval represents a significant milestone that paves the way for increased institutional and retail investments in crypto ETFs and addresses critical regulatory issues that have surrounded Ethereum for years. The approval of these Ethereum ETFs is especially noteworthy in light of recent comments by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler who suggested that Ethereum, due to its staking mechanics, might be classified as a security under SEC regulations.\n\nThe approval of these applications occurred without much resistance, which is a notable departure from the contentious process that preceded the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. As outlined in our prior article, the SEC only approved BTC ETFs after three federal judges ordered the SEC to grant approval following Grayscale Investments\u2019 victory in court. In Grayscale Investments v. SEC, the D.C. Circuit found the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s application to list a BTC ETF.\n\nIn contrast, this time the SEC approved the Ethereum ETF applications of its own volition. While this maneuver might have been to avoid more litigation and public scrutiny, the approval shows a steady departure from \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d and a movement toward actions that promote growth in the cryptocurrency industry and investor freedom.\n\nThis piece begins by explaining what the SEC has approved and why. Next, our team comments on what to expect in the future and what this all means for the cryptocurrency industry and investors going forward.\n\nThe Approval Order\n\nThe SEC approved the listing and trading of eight Ethereum (ETH) ETFs: the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, the Bitwise Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust, the VanEck Ethereum Trust, the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF[1], the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and the Franklin Ethereum ETF. All the ETH ETF sponsors are familiar names from the first round of BTC ETFs.\n\nThe most important development from the approval order was the SEC heavily implying that ETH is a commodity and not a security. The SEC approved the applications under the rules for commodity-based trust shares. None of the sponsors filed applications under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is required for ETFs that trade securities. Additionally, the SEC only cited court precedents that involved commodities and not securities to support approving the applications.\n\nThe SEC further justified its approval in ways reminiscent of how it explained approval of the BTC ETFs. Notably, the commission cited the high correlation between spot ETH prices and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures market. This is significant because CME surveillance of spot ETH markets would help detect any market manipulation that could affect the integrity of ETH ETFs.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the Ethereum ETFs comes with specific conditions, including a prohibition on staking ETH via ETH ETFs. If the sponsors of these ETFs want approval to stake ETH, they will need to submit a proposed rule change and wait for SEC approval.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAlthough the SEC, in late May, approved the sponsors\u2019 applications to list ETH ETFs on public exchanges, we likely will not see the ETFs listed for trading on those exchanges until mid-to-late July, at the earliest. Each sponsor must submit an S-1 filing as a registration statement and wait for SEC approval before the ETFs can actually be listed for trading. Recently, the SEC returned the submitted S-1 forms with slight comments, asking sponsors to resubmit by July 8, 2024, which delayed the expected launch. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had previously stated that an end of June launch for the ETH ETFs was a \u201clegit possibility,\u201d but recently revised his prediction, suggesting an expected launch date of mid-to-late July, pending the SEC\u2019s review and final approval of the resubmitted S-1 forms.\n\nSimilar to our prediction for the BTC ETFs, we again expect a heated battle for market dominance. Generally, the first movers in the ETF industry box out competitors by gaining significant market share early on. Other factors, such as brand recognition, price competition, commitment to the crypto industry, and developments in disruptive technology may also prove important. But at the moment, it is unclear what factors will affect the ETH ETF market or to what degree each factor will affect the market. Price and market power will likely be important to investment banks, but analyst prowess may be relatively unimportant considering that the ETH ETFs are single-asset funds.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETFs represents a clear and positive step in the classification of ETH as a commodity, the SEC remains free to argue that ETH staking is an investment contract (a.k.a., a security) subject to its jurisdiction. That said, the SEC cannot rationally assert that ETH alone is not a security in the case of ETH ETFs but that it is a security in other cases. If sponsors want to stake the ETH in the ETFs, the SEC may put up much more a fight than they did in approving the ETF applications in the first place. Notably, the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) aims to classify ETH and many other crypto assets as commodities. The House of Representatives passed FIT21 on May 22, 2024, but the bill\u2019s prospects in the Senate are uncertain. It remains to be seen if FIT21 will be the first piece of federal cryptocurrency asset legislation.\n\nThe Approval Order only covers ETH ETFs, not any other single-crypto-asset fund or any multi-asset-crypto-fund. However, the fact that the SEC has now approved two cryptocurrency ETFs shows a shift in the political and regulatory landscape regarding cryptocurrency assets. Even if the SEC treats the \u201cvast-majority\u201d of cryptocurrency assets as securities, the focus will undoubtedly shift to which cryptocurrency asset will be the next to gain ETF approval.\n\nOur Perspective\n\nOverall, this is a positive step forward by the SEC and for the cryptocurrency asset industry, which is piercing mainstream financial markets in aggressive fashion, pushing innovative investment and technology opportunities to the forefront.\n\nThe Approval Order demonstrates that crypto assets can start life as a security and transition to a commodity (or other non-security) over time. Thus, Ethereum\u2019s founders, and the founders of many other cryptocurrency assets, can rest easier knowing that their assets either are or can become so decentralized that the SEC cannot classify them as securities.\n\nEven following the Approval Order, we still expect SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to reiterate his position that most cryptocurrency assets are still securities in the eyes of the SEC. Chairman Gensler affirmed this belief in the wake of approving BTC ETFs, and again in the days leading up to the ETH ETF Approval Order. But we are optimistic that the SEC\u2019s decision to approve two cryptocurrency ETFs demonstrates the SEC staff\u2019s commitment to a \u201cmerit-neutral\u201d perspective.\n\nThe Approval Order will stimulate growth in the fledgling United States cryptocurrency retail market. When the ETFs are listed on public exchanges, U.S. investors will be able to buy, sell, and hold ETH in their IRAs, 401Ks, and brokerage accounts. In the coming years, it is very possible we will view the SEC\u2019s decision to approve ETH ETFs as an important step in what became a trend of integrating cryptocurrency assets into traditional finance networks through ETFs and other financial instruments.\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s action is certainly a good step forward for investor freedom, the SEC is still preventing investors from unlocking the full potential of their investment. The decision to prohibit sponsors from staking ETH in the ETFs likely deprives investors of an average additional 2.61% return on ETH staked for one year. The staking issue will pose many crucial questions going forward: How will sponsors and investors craft staking agreements for each ETF? What will the SEC do when a sponsor submits a proposed rule change to allow staking? Can the SEC resolve this issue amicably by cooperating with the industry, or will the courts have to decide?\n\nWe believe that the SEC cannot credibly assert that ETH alone is a security in some cases but not in other cases, so the freedom to stake ETH in the ETFs should not be as big of an issue the SEC is setting it up to be. Still, the SEC may need to hear that from a judge before it concedes.\n\nIn conclusion, we would be remiss to not remind readers that good governance by cryptocurrency-savvy, ETF-savvy officers and directors, and expert SEC legal advice by counsel, will all be necessary for sustainable market success in this industry. The digital assets industry is still a young, volatile, and highly creative technology sector that is fraught with perils identified as legal and regulatory \u201crisk factors\u201d in several prospectuses.\n\nETFs are complex. Cryptocurrency assets are beyond complex. Sponsors and banks should not seek SEC approval for a cryptocurrency asset ETF, nor should a bank, broker, or RIA contract with a cryptocurrency asset ETF sponsor or authorized participant, unless led and advised by seasoned counsel.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan Chatoo, a summer associate in Foley\u2019s Miami office, for his contributions to this article.\n\n[1] On May 31 ARK Invest ended its partnership with 21Shares and is no longer involved with the ETF. The SEC has approved 21Shares to continue under the rebranded name of 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF."

        "title": "Ethereum ETPs Could Help ETH Price Surge Past $5,000: Bitwise CIO - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, is forecasting a bright future for Ethereum, predicting the cryptocurrency will surpass its all-time high by year-end thanks in part to the launch of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) to trade above $5,000.\n\nIn a new blog post, Bitwise noted that he believes that the launch of these Ethereum ETPs \u201ccould be choppy,\u201d as \u201cmoney may flow out of the $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) after it converts to an ETP.\u201d\n\nPer Hougan, since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETPs these funds have \u201cbrought more than twice as much Bitcoin as miners have been able to produce,\u201d with these ETPs buying up 263,965 coins while miners produced 129,181 BTC since their launch.The result was Bitcoin\u2019s price rose.\n\nSource: Bitwise\n\nHougan\u2019s bullish outlook hinges on three key factors that differentiate Ethereum from Bitcoin.First, Ethereum boasts a significantly lower short-term inflation rate compared to Bitcoin when its ETPs debuted.\n\nWhile Bitcoin saw an inflation rate of 1.7%, Ethereum currently sits at nearly zero as consumed ETH is burned on the network. This balance between new coin creation and network activity creates a more favorable supply-demand dynamic for Ethereum, potentially pushing prices upwards.\n\nSecondly, Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake system reduces selling pressure on the market. Unlike Bitcoin miners who must often sell newly minted coins to cover operational costs, validators on the Ethereum network face no such pressure, translating to less forced selling of ETH, further bolstering its price.\n\nLastly, a significant portion of the Ethereum supply is currently unavailable for sale as roughly 28% of all ETH is staked, while an additional 13% is locked up in decentralized finance smart contracts. With nearly 40% of the total supply effectively removed from circulation, scarcity could drive prices higher, he argued.\n\nHougan anticipates these factors, coupled with an estimated $15 billion flowing into new Ethereum ETPs over the next 18 months, to create a perfect storm for Ethereum\u2019s price surge.\n\nWith the cryptocurrency currently trading at around $3,400 after moving up 11%, it\u2019s well below its previous peak. To Hougan, it is likely that Ethereum will not only challenge its all-time high but potentially surpass it.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a No-Brainer Buy After the Bitcoin Halving? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The world's second largest cryptocurrency still has near-term catalysts.\n\nMany cryptocurrencies pulled back a couple of years ago from their all-time highs as rising interest rates drove investors toward more conservative investments. Yet three tailwinds have lifted the broader market this year: expectations for lower rates, the approvals of the first Bitcoin (BTC -4.01%) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, and Bitcoin's halving in April.\n\nBut now that Bitcoin has concluded its long-awaited halving, which reduces the rewards for mining Bitcoin every four years, there will probably be fewer near-term catalysts for the world's top cryptocurrency. So is it time to turn our attention toward Ethereum (ETH -6.78%), the world's second largest cryptocurrency, for bigger gains this year?\n\nThe differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nEther is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, which was launched in 2015. Ethereum initially used the same energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method as Bitcoin, but it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method in a process called The Merge in 2022. That transition reduced Ethereum's mining energy consumption by 99.95% and made it deflationary -- which meant more coins were being burned, or permanently removed from circulation, than created. PoS blockchains also allow investors to stake, or lock up, their tokens for fixed periods to earn interest-like rewards.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain was also developed to support smart contracts, which can be used to create decentralized apps (dApps), smaller tokens, and other crypto assets. Bitcoin's blockchain can be used only to mine more coins. That's why Ethereum is usually valued by the expansion of its developer ecosystem, while Bitcoin is often compared to gold or silver.\n\nThat key difference drove the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to say that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified a commodity. That classification supported its approvals of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYet the SEC was reluctant to call Ethereum and other PoS coins commodities, saying the staking process made it similar to securities. Nevertheless, the SEC still cleared the way for Ethereum's first spot-price ETF applications earlier this year.\n\nThe tailwinds and headwinds for Ethereum\n\nEthereum's biggest near-term catalyst will be the potential approvals of its first spot ETFs. The SEC has already reportedly granted preliminary approvals to at least three of the eight planned spot-price ETFs, according to Reuters, and the latest speculation suggests most of those funds could start trading as early as July 23.\n\nEthereum's price has already risen about 50% this year, but the first spot ETFs might drive its price even higher. For reference, Bitcoin's price has rallied more than 40% since the approvals of its first 11 ETFs on Jan. 10.\n\nAnother major catalyst is Ethereum's recent Dencun upgrade, which increases its speed and reduces the gas fees -- essentially network user fees -- for its Layer-2 blockchain. Stabilizing and declining interest rates could also drive investors back to Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nYet Ethereum still faces unpredictable headwinds. The Dencun upgrade made Ethereum inflationary again, and its supply will keep rising unless more tokens are burned. It also still processes transactions at a slower rate than newer PoS blockchains such as Solana (SOL -6.89%) and Cardano (ADA -9.13%) -- and those limitations could curb the expansion of its ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's planned spot ETFs also won't feature any staking mechanisms like its underlying tokens, so it might not be a compelling alternative to directly owning the cryptocurrency. Lastly, the market's expectations for lower rates and ETF approvals might have already been baked into its current price.\n\nSo is Ethereum a no-brainer buy right now?\n\nEthereum is trading at about $3,400 as of this writing, but some bullish investors expect it to generate huge gains during the next few years. VanEck's Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush expect its price to more than triple to $11,800 by 2030, while Ark Invest's Cathie Wood says it could be worth a whopping $166,000 by 2032.\n\nWe should take those rosy estimates with a grain of salt, but I believe Ethereum's spot-price ETF approvals and lower interest rates should limit its downside potential this year. The Ethereum network's next planned upgrade, Pectra, should further increase its speed and lower its gas fees to keep pace with Solana and Cardano. Therefore, I believe Ethereum is still a good cryptocurrency to accumulate right now -- but investors shouldn't necessarily expect it to blast off in the next few months."

        "content": "BlackRock Sets 0.25% Fee for Spot Ethereum ETF Ahead of Potential Launch\n\nAsset management giant BlackRock has announced a 0.25% fee for its upcoming spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is expected to launch next week. According to BlackRock's S-1 registration statement filed on July 17, the fee will be accrued daily at an annualized rate of 0.25% of the fund\u2019s net asset value and will be payable at least every three months, either in US dollars, in-kind, or a combination of both.\n\nBlackRock has also indicated that it may waive all or part of the fee for certain periods, with plans to implement such a waiver upon the ETF's launch. Similar to the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, the spot Ether ETF will initially trade at a reduced fee of 0.12% until it either reaches 12 months in operation or amasses $2.5 billion in net assets, whichever comes first.\n\nOther asset managers have also disclosed their proposed fees and waiver periods amid a surge of amended S-1 registration forms. Franklin Templeton\u2019s spot Ether ETF will charge the lowest fee at 0.19%, while Bitwise and VanEck have set their fees at 0.20%. The 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF will charge 0.21%, and Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy will match BlackRock's fee of 0.25%.\n\nNotably, five issuers, Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and VanEck, plan to waive their fees initially. VanEck's fee will be waived for the first 12 months or until it reaches $1.5 billion in net assets, whichever comes first. Bitwise will waive its fee for the first six months or until it accumulates $0.5 billion in net assets. Franklin Templeton has set a waiver period until January 31, 2025, or until it reaches a $10 billion threshold. Fidelity will waive fees until January 1, 2025, after which the fee will increase to 0.25%.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale has set a fee of 2.5% for its spot Ether ETF. However, its newly approved Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust will offer a more competitive fee of 0.25%. Grayscale also announced that 10% of its spot Ethereum ETF will establish the Ethereum Mini Trust, providing $1 billion in seed funding."

The five ETFs are 21Shares\u2019 CETH, Fidelity\u2019s FETH, Franklin Templeton\u2019s EZET, Invesco\u2019s QETH, and VanEck\u2019s ETHV.\n\nEach ETF will be listed on Cboe\u2019s BZX Exchange and quoted on the SIAC Tape B data feed.\n\nSenior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported on July 15 that the SEC had instructed issuers to submit final amendments in preparation for a trading launch next week.\n\nSources told Balchunas that the regulator would give the final green light on July 22, setting the stage for a Tuesday trading launch. The issuers subsequently filed amended S-1 forms on July 18, revealing the final details for their funds, including sponsor fees.\n\nThe introduction of these ETFs is anticipated to enhance Ethereum\u2019s liquidity and market depth.

So, if you invested $1,000 then, it would have fetched you 0.58 Ether.\n\nThat seems a long time ago. The cryptocurrency ballooned to its all-time high of $4,878 later in 2021, faced a painful winter in 2022, and made a spirited recovery in 2023-24.\n\nAs of this writing, one Ether is priced at $3,449.26. Therefore, 0.58 ETH will be worth $2,000 today, nearly doubling in value.\n\nWhy It Matters: Ether has been on a strong recovery path this year, jumping 51% year-to-date. Its YTD gains have mirrored that of the apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nA big part of the boost has come from the approval of exchange-traded funds that will track the price of the asset in real-time. The ETFs are likely to begin trading by next week, giving mainstream investors a convenient way to get exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nNote that as of today, Mark Cuban just holds 0.026 Ether, worth $88.11 in his portfolio, according to data from Arkham Intelligence.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article If You Invested $1,000 In Ethereum When Mark Cuban Called It Closest We Have To A 'True Currency,' Here's How Much You'd Have Today originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Ethereum Derivatives Market Flat Despite Imminent ETF Launch - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum Derivatives Market Flat Despite Imminent ETF Launch\n\nEthereum (ETH) experienced a notable rally in the past week, gaining 10.4% to reach up to $3,500. However, it encountered strong resistance at the $3,500 mark, and is currently trading at $3,416, down 0.20% in the past 24 hours. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved two additional spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite this seemingly positive development, the derivatives market for Ether has shown minimal excitement.\n\nThe SEC has reportedly granted preliminary approval to at least three issuers to start trading spot Ethereum ETFs on July 23, with a total of eight waiting for final regulatory approval. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, is optimistic about Ether\u2019s price hitting $5,000 by the end of 2024. He cites factors such as Ether's low inflation rate, minimal costs for validators, and the fact that 28% of its supply is locked in staking.\n\nDespite these forecasts and the overall crypto market capitalization increasing by 43% year-to-date in 2024, Ethereum investors remain surprisingly cautious. Typically, futures contracts should trade 5% to 10% higher than spot markets due to their extended settlement periods. Currently, the annualized premium for Ether's fixed-month contracts stands at 11%, indicating moderate optimism. However, this indicator has not maintained levels above 12% in the past month, raising concerns given the expected inflows from the upcoming spot ETF launch in the US. Similarly, Bitcoin\u2019s basis rate also stands at 11%, suggesting no excessive bullishness among Ethereum investors.\n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the latest US Producer Price Index showed a 2.6% increase over the previous year, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%. This indicates that the US Federal Reserve still faces challenges in controlling inflation, which could continue to dampen demand. Furthermore, China's disappointing annual GDP growth of 4.7% could have negative implications for global stock markets."

        "content": "Grayscale Investments is keeping its spot Ethereum ETF fees at 2.5%.\n\nThat\u2019s 10 times more expensive than its competitors\u2019 fees.\n\nThe ETF will likely suffer high outflows at launch.\n\nThe results are in: Grayscale Investments will keep charging a 2.5% fee to holders of its Ethereum trust when it converts into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nThat\u2019s a massive fee compared with other potential Ethereum ETFs \u2014 which are all set to launch on July 23.\n\n\u201cGrayscale isn\u2019t lowering its fees at all,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X, pointing out that the firm\u2019s ETF will be roughly 10 times more expensive than its competition.\n\n\u201cProbably will cause some outrage flows,\u201d Balchunas added.\n\nBy comparison, the Ethereum ETFs issued by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments will each have a 0.25% fee, VanEck and Bitwise will each charge 0.20%, and Franklin Templeton 0.19%.\n\nInflows and outflows\n\nGrayscale\u2019s case is unique in that it isn\u2019t spinning up a new fund from scratch, but converting its existing Ethereum Trust \u2014 ticker ETHE, which holds almost $10 billion in assets \u2014 into an ETF.\n\nThe trust was designed in such a way that investors could create new shares, but not redeem them. Even so, the trust was popular for a long time because it was one of the only ways for Wall Street investors to get exposure to Ethereum.\n\nAnd because it was the only game in town, Grayscale could get away with its 2.5% fees.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut once the trust converts into a fund \u2014 at the same time all other Ethereum ETFs launch \u2014 investors will be able to finally redeem their shares.\n\nAnd because other Ethereum ETFs will launch imminently, Grayscale risks seeing outflows from its fund to cheaper alternatives.\n\nThe same thing happened with spot Bitcoin ETFs: Grayscale has seen more than $18 billion in outflows since it converted its Bitcoin trust into an ETF in January.\n\nBlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs, meanwhile, have amassed over $30 billion in assets between the two of them.\n\nGrayscale didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nHigh fees and no yield\n\nAlongside ETHE\u2019s conversion, Grayscale is launching a separate spot Ethereum ETF, called the mini Ethereum ETF. The mini fund will process smaller fees \u2014 0.25% \u2014 and will be seeded with 10% of ETHE\u2019s assets upon launch.\n\nThe move \u201cshould help alleviate some of the likely Grayscale outflows,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart posted on X.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one massive idiosyncratic factor with Ethereum that will affect demand and that\u2019s staking,\u201d Adam Morgan McCarthy, an analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko Research, told DL News.\n\nWhen using crypto infrastructure, Ethereum holders can lock their Ether in the network \u2014 a process called staking \u2014 to receive a 3% yield. But the Ethereum ETFs won\u2019t give holders that opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe value proposition for a crypto-native fund holding ETHE is hard to see when these funds can redeem shares and buy Ether to stake in return for yields \u2014 as opposed to paying high fees to stick around in Grayscale\u2019s fund,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cEven paying 0.2% without the staking element seems like a nonstarter to me,\u201d he added.\n\nMcCarthy pointed out that, because Ethereum enabled staking relatively recently, in 2022, some ETHE investors are likely still waiting to exit the fund and lock their Ether in staking protocols.\n\n\u201cExpect outflows from ETHE and some reallocation into new funds which are launching with waivers and low fees,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cBut a decent chunk of outflows will exit the market altogether,\u201d he added.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Ethereum Staking Nears Record High as Spot ETFs Set to Launch in the U.S.\n\nEthereum (ETH) staking is approaching record levels, driven by increasing rewards and the imminent launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. According to data from Beaconchain, over 33.2 million Ethereum tokens, valued at approximately $114 billion, are currently staked. This represents about 28% of the total ETH supply. ETH is currently trading at $3,419, down 1.97% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe rise in staked ETH aligns with a nearly 5% increase in the estimated reward rate for staking Ethereum over the past month. Staking involves locking up ETH for a specified period to help secure the proof-of-stake network, in exchange for rewards. As of now, the estimated reward rate is 2.60%, up from 2.48% a month ago. Ethereum staking has been steadily increasing, surpassing 30 million ETH in February and reaching an all-time high of over 33.4 million ETH on July 12, according to on-chain data from Dune.\n\nDespite the allure of staking rewards, the substantial amount of staked ETH has raised centralization concerns. Platforms like Lido command 29% of all staked ETH, along with significant stakes held by Coinbase and other entities.\n\nInvestor interest in staking is also buoyed by the anticipated approval of multiple spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the exchange-traded funds, which differ from their underlying asset, won't be able to be staked, yet they are expected to attract significant investor interest.\n\nSome analysts predict that inflows into these new Ethereum ETFs might be modest. A recent Citi research report indicates that spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. could receive only 30% to 35% of the net inflows seen by their Bitcoin counterparts, with a potential skew towards lower inflows."

        "content": "Eric Balchunas, a renowned financial analyst, recently expressed skepticism about the potential success of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) spot ETF due to its high fee structure.\n\nWhat Happened: Grayscale submitted updated S-1 filings with the SEC Wednesday, revealing the all-important information about the fund management fee. The digital asset management giant will charge 2.5% for its Grayscale Ethereum Trust, significantly higher than its competitors. A miniature version of the fund, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, will however charge 0.25%.\n\nBalchunas questioned these moves, asking whether the 0.25% fee would be low enough to attract sufficient organic flows to offset what he referred to as \u201cThe Big Unlock\u201d.\n\nHe further speculated on the ability of new entrants to the market to counterbalance the predicted outflows due to the flagship version\u2019s high fees, drawing a parallel with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). \u201cAnyway short story is the 2.5% fee made path to a decent net flow number a little harder,\u201d Balchunas feared.\n\nCheap but not sure cheap enough to move the needle (as most are cheaper and brand name BlackRock is same fee) to attract organic flows to offset The Big Unlock. And do these newborns have enough strength to offset those outflows a la btc. Anyway short story is the 2.5% fee made\u2026 https://t.co/0sH0tXrjtL \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 17, 2024\n\nAnother well-known ETF expert, Nate Geraci, called this a \u201chuge miss\u201d by Grayscale, indicating that the mini trust should have been priced much lower. \u201cEntire pricing strategy around both spot BTC & ETH ETFs seems focused on maximizing short-term revenue vs playing long game,\u201d Geraci stated.\n\nBtw, think this is *huge* miss by Grayscale\u2026\n\n\n\nIf you're gonna charge *2.5%* on ETHE, need to undercut market w/ mini trust.\n\n\n\nDisappointing.\n\n\n\nEntire pricing strategy around both spot btc & eth ETFs seems focused on maximizing short-term revenue vs playing long game. https://t.co/8DE1UIlCIo \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 17, 2024\n\nSee Also: Mark Cuban: Trump\u2019s Re-Election Won\u2019t Directly Impact Bitcoin\u2019s Price\n\nWhy It Matters: These criticisms come even as other funds, including the one by BlackRock, are priced much lower. The ishares Ethereum Trust will charge 0.25%, and so will the ETFs by Fidelity and Invesco.\n\nGrayscale, which already operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSE:GBTC), faced significant outflows pressure after launch due to its 1.5% fees, highest among all spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since launch, it has recorded net outflows of $18.69 billion as of this writing, according to SoSo Value.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s flagship Ethereum Trust, along with the mini Trust, are expected to go live for trading by July 23.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was exchanging hands at $3,423.79, down 1.55% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nIllustration via Shutterstock.\n\nRead Next:"

Furthermore, many Hong Kong investors and family offices have direct access to US markets, diminishing the local ETFs\u2019 appeal.\n\nAnother significant obstacle is the readiness of intermediary channels, which are crucial for distributing ETFs.\n\n\u201cThese intermediaries are not fully ready,\u201d Pan explained.\n\nDespite these challenges, Pan believes that regulatory approvals for features like staking could catalyse growth.\n\nHe also anticipates a better performance in the coming quarter, as market conditions stabilise and regulatory clarity improves.\n\nCallan Quinn is DL News\u2019 Hong Kong-based Asia Correspondent.

        "content": "On-chain data shows that the WazirX exploiter has converted most of the stolen assets from the Indian crypto platform into Ethereum.\n\nOn July 18, WazirX was exploited for around $235 million in several digital assets, with blockchain investigators suggesting that the North Korea-backed Lazarus Group perpetrated the attack.\n\nWhile the exchange quickly implemented measures to stop the theft, recovering the funds seems unlikely as the attacker actively converts the stolen assets into ETH, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nWazirX exploiter holds nearly 60,000 ETH.\n\nBlockchain analyst Lookonchain reported that the WazirX exploiter had converted most of the stolen assets to 43,800 ETH, worth $149.46 million. This brings the total ETH in the attacker holding to 59,097 ETH, valued at around $201.67 million.\n\nMarket observers suggested that the asset conversion was part of a sophisticated money laundering technique that also involves using crypto mixing services like Tornado Cash to obfuscate the transaction trails.\n\nDespite this, the exploiter\u2019s address still has up to $15 million worth of other relatively lesser-known digital assets left. This includes 1.66 billion DENT, worth $1.56 million, and 6.76 million CHR, worth $1.72 million, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain data shows the exploiter sent 7.7 million DENT, worth $7,300, to a new Binance deposit address. Lookonchain said:\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that the WazirX exploiter deposited 7.7 million DENT ($7.3K) to a Binance deposit address that has not been used before.\u201d\n\n\u2018Force Majeure\u2019\n\nA post-mortem report from the exchange showed that the affected wallet used Liminal\u2019s services, a digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure provider.\n\nWazirX explained that the exploit resulted from discrepancies between the data on Liminal\u2019s interface and the transaction\u2019s content. It wrote:\n\n\u201cDuring the cyber attack, there was a mismatch between the information displayed on Liminal\u2019s interface and what was actually signed. We suspect the payload was replaced to transfer wallet control to an attacker.\u201d\n\nThe exchange also described the attack as a \u201cforce majeure\u201d event beyond its control and assured it was actively working to recover the stolen funds.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "BlackRock, a leading asset management firm, has announced a 0.25% fee for its soon-to-launch spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock stated in an amended S-1 registration statement filed on Wednesday that it might \u201cwaive all or a portion\u201d of the fee for certain periods of time.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Ether ETF will start trading with a reduced fee of 0.12%, either until 12 months have passed or the fund reaches $2.5 billion in net assets, whichever occurs first, with potential fee waivers at launch. The amendment statements come after the Bloomberg Analyst announced 23rd July as the Ethereum ETF launch date.\n\n\u201cThe Sponsor\u2019s Fee is accrued daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.25% of the net asset value of the Trust and is payable at least quarterly in arrears in U.S. dollars or in-kind or any combination thereof,\u201d said the firm in their recent S-1 registration statement.\n\nOther issuers have also outlined their fee structures amidst a flurry of amended S-1 registration forms. Franklin Templeton\u2019s spot Ether ETF plans to charge the lowest fee at 0.19%, while Bitwise, VanEck, and the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF have set their fees at 0.20%, 0.20%, and 0.21% respectively. Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy will match BlackRock with a 0.25% fee.\n\nNotably, Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and VanEck plan to waive their fees at launch, with VanEck waiving fees for 12 months or until it reaches $1.5 billion in net assets and Bitwise waiving fees for six months or until it hits $0.5 billion in net assets.\n\nGrayscale, however, will maintain its fee for the spot Ether ETF at 2.5%. Conversely, its newly approved Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust will offer a more competitive 0.25% fee.\n\nPending approval, these ETFs will be listed on major exchanges including Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, expanding access to Ethereum investments for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nThe decision by BlackRock to introduce a 0.25% fee for its Ethereum ETF, with potential fee waivers, reflects strategic flexibility amid market competition and investor expectations."

        "content": "A prominent crypto analyst is issuing a warning to traders, saying that Ethereum (ETH) could underperform against Bitcoin (BTC) in the short term.\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 642,600 followers on the social media platform X that he believes Ethereum will be outpaced by the crypto king during the next week.\n\nHowever, the strategist says that the launch of spot market Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will eventually cause the leading smart contract platform to outpace the crypto king.\n\n\u201cGonna be a contrarian here and say that I believe Ethereum actually dips a bit next week vs. BTC. Lots of hype leading into the spot ETF launch (which I think is warranted), but don\u2019t think this manifests into outperformance until a couple months later.\u201d\n\nThe trader\u2019s chart suggests that ETH/BTC will hit 0.1500 by the end of 2025 or at the start of 2026. According to TradingView, it is currently sitting at 0.053.\n\nKaleo goes on to note that traders shouldn\u2019t panic if Ethereum doesn\u2019t immediately rise after the launch of its ETFs as Bitcoin experienced weeks of choppiness before breaking out.\n\n\u201cFriendly reminder that we didn\u2019t see up only immediately after the BTC spot ETFs started trading. Price went up leading into it, followed by a couple of weeks moving lower afterward before things really started to rip again.\n\nPoint being \u2013 if we don\u2019t see green candles across the board next week immediately after the spot ETH ETFs launch \u2013 it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d\n\nThe trader concludes his analysis by saying that BTC looks primed to outpace the stock market.\n\n\u201cBTC: Strong bounce off support for the Bitcoin/SPX ratio. Looks pretty obvious BTC continues to outpace stonks from here.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $3,404 at time of writing while BTC is valued at $63,597.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum VS Solana: Which Blockchain is Better for Minting NFTs? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "If you\u2019re struggling to decide between choosing Solana or Ethereum to mint your Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), you have come to the right place. In this guide, we\u2019ll explore each blockchains\u2019 strengths, capacities, weak points, and overall differences so you can make a better decision that suits your goals in the NFT market.\n\nEthereum: Ecosystem, Marketplace, and Security\n\nEthereum is undoubtedly the largest ecosystem in the DeFi (decentralized finance) sector, with thousands of projects of all kinds building on it. So it\u2019s no surprise that the vast majority of NFTs are running on it as ERC-721 tokens.\n\nTo be accurate, roughly 95% of all the NFT ecosystem uses Ethereum, so it\u2019s no coincidence that when investors look for an NFT marketplace, the first one they usually run up to is OpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and more.\n\nWhen it comes to size, Ethereum takes the lead with a much bigger pool of buyers and sellers \u2013 or, in other words, trading volume. So if you mint NFTs in an Ethereum-based marketplace like OpenSea, you could get more exposure and people willing to buy or place bids on your NFTs. On the other hand, everyone knows there\u2019s also a huge supply of NFTs that no one would ever like to buy or bid for.\n\nWant to mint your first NFT on OpenSea? Check our step-by-step guide here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s attributes make it one of the top ecosystems for starting a DeFi project. Its data architecture and security components are the reason why so many developers are building on top of its blockchain.\n\nHowever, when network activity increases exponentially (which is something frequent), the network suffers a major transaction backlog, which leads to an enormous spike in transaction fees that usually surpass the digits per transaction, something that could be affecting the number of users who can afford to mint NFTs.\n\nThis has prompted NFT creators and collectors to seek alternative blockchains with higher throughput, scalability, and lower gas fees. One option that has become a very serious competitor is Solana \u2014a high-performance blockchain that leverages different cryptographic mechanisms to scale its network (we\u2019ll discuss this later.)\n\nWhile paying elevated gas fees can be a crippling experience sometimes, the upside is there\u2019s more money flowing in Ethereum, so the flipping ceiling is way higher. Data from CryptoSlam shows that Ethereum has had a whopping selling volume of over $1.8 billion in the last 30 days, compared to $120 million from Solana-based marketplaces.\n\nAccording to current data from CryptoSlam, the most popular NFT collections in the market exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These include CryptoPunks, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and so forth.\n\nAdditional data shows that the average NFT sale price in Ethereum (as of Q4 2021) was around $3,000 compared to Solana\u2019s $1,000.\n\nSolana: Throughput, Low Fees, Growing Ecosystem\n\nSolana takes the lead in terms of technology, functionality, and versatility.\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain that uses a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History, which leverages a set of protocols to execute transactions with high throughput\u2014 more than 60,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nIn Solana, transaction costs are usually less than a dollar. Many NFT projects and collectors are migrating to Solana to benefit from its scalability and low transaction fees. They have more freedom to build their projects without suffering from technical limitations, which is why Solana is turning into a hub for general NFTs.\n\nMinting NFTs with a Solana-based marketplace like Solsea is remarkably cheap, fast, and easy to profit from once it hits the secondary market. Usually, Solana mints are quickly snapped up, and royalties in Solana-based markets are also frequently higher compared to Ethereum-based ones.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s ecosystem isn\u2019t nearly as big as Ethereum\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t growing. In fact, Solana\u2019s user base has been growing at a much faster pace since the beginning of 2022, and even analysts from investment bank JP Morgan have claimed that it could overtake Ethereum in the long run.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, the NFT market in Solana gained significant momentum throughout the third quarter of 2022. By the end of January, the ecosystem\u2019s sales volume crossed the $1 billion mark.\n\nOne of the most popular collections on the Solana blockchain is the Degenerate Ape Academy, a collection of 10,000 unique NFT Apes.\n\nWhile they may look similar to the Bored Apes from Ethereum, they have their own set of unique traits.\n\nThey can be pretty expensive, too\u2014the highest sale price for a Degen Ape was $1.1 million in September 2021. However, in mid-December, an NFT from the Solana Monkey Business collection was sold for over 13,000 SOL, or about $2 million.\n\nGrowing ecosystems frequently offer early adopters a great opportunity to establish themselves at the top of the list by the time they reach a larger audience. However, one of their problems is that the risk is usually higher. Since the beginning of 2022, the Solana network has suffered several downtimes, forcing users to liquidate their positions as they were unable to top up their collateral during the outages.\n\nAnother concern that developers have addressed lately is the rise of rug pulls in Solana. This is usually the problem with emerging technologies, as scammers will try to spot and take advantage of any weak points they can find. However, rug pulls and scams can happen on both sides of the story, so it\u2019s not only about security issues but rather making sure you do good research before investing in an NFT or any DeFi projects.\n\nRugpulls are the most common type of scam in the DeFi ecosystem. If you want to learn how to spot them, check our latest guide on the matter.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nEach blockchain has its own pros and cons, so it really comes down to what you want to do with each one. If you\u2019re looking for a high-throughput blockchain with scalability and low gas fees, then Solana might be more suitable for you.\n\nSolana\n\nPros:\n\nHigher throughput and scalability.\n\nGrowing ecosystem.\n\nLow gas fees and environmentally friendly.\n\nMinting NFTs is cheap and relatively straightforward.\n\nCons:\n\nLess secure network.\n\nLower exposure with a smaller market.\n\nDowntimes are more frequent.\n\nNow, if you want exposure to a bigger market and benefit from the security aspects, then you might be better off with Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\n\nPros:\n\nAccess to a larger market.\n\nHigh network security.\n\nNFTs are sold for a much higher price on average.\n\nCons:\n\nNetwork congestion can cause transaction delays.\n\nLower throughput and scalability.\n\nTransaction fees can become unpayable for a good percentage of users who want to mint NFTs."

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s has a hefty 2.5% fee, 10X higher than its competition.\n\nBlackRock fees are set at 0.25% as the market expects outrage flows from Grayscale.\n\nPotential Ethereum [ETH] ETF issuers updated their fee structure on Wednesday as the market prepares for potential S-1 approvals and launch of the products on July 23rd.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, about seven issuers have waivers based on either period or assets held.\n\nHowever, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE had the heftiest fees at 2.5%, while BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust pegged fees at 0.25% post waiver.\n\nUnlike BlackRock\u2019s 0.12% starting fee for 12 months, if net assets are below $2.5 billion, Grayscale\u2019s ETHE will maintain 2.5% throughout after the conversion of its trust to ETF on 23rd July.\n\nEthereum ETF fee wars\n\nThis has riled the market commentators. One observer, Nate Geraci of ETF Store, termed Grayscale\u2019s move a \u2018huge miss\u2019 and that it was disappointing.\n\nFor his part, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas cautioned that Grayscale\u2019s fees were \u201810X higher than competition\u2019 and \u2018outrage outflows\u2019 were likely.\n\n\u201cGrayscale not lowering at all. This means they 10x higher than competition. Wow. Prob cause some outrage outflows. My guess is the Mini ETF will be dirt cheap tho, like maybe 15bps. Interesting dynamic at play.\u201d\n\nFor perspective, indeed, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) had a similar fee structure as BlackRock: 0.25% with 0.12% as the starting fee. The Mini Trust will reportedly be spun off from ETHE after the conversion.\n\n\u201c10% of $ETHE will be automatically spun off and into $ETH. $ETHE currently has $10 billion in assets. So $ETH should essentially start it\u2019s life with $1 billion in assets.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the Mini Trust\u2019s lower fees, some market observers projected massive outflows from ETHE.\n\nPer HODL15 Capital estimates, ETHE outflows could hit 50%-60% following the hefty fees.\n\n\u201cWill Grayscale replicate the $GBTC fee mistake with $ETHE? If so, expect 50%-60% outflows \ud83d\udc47 Just over $10 Billion AUM.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has stated that ETH ETF staking could be open for reconsideration amidst looming political change in the U.S.\n\nOn the price front, ETH\u2019s recent recovery hit resistance at $3.5K. The second-largest digital asset traded at $3.4K as of press time and could only eye $4K if it cleared the $3.5K."

        "title": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warns against voting on crypto policy, as a16z founders endorse Trump - Fortune",
        "content": "One of crypto\u2019s most influential voices has warned the industry to refrain from voting for political candidates based solely on their digital asset policies. In a blog published Wednesday, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin argues that electing candidates simply for being crypto \u201cfriendly\u201d could hurt the industry more in the long-run. Considering whether candidates are ideologically at-odds with what crypto stands for, is more important than if they endorse the right to trade coins in the here and now, he argues.\n\n\u201cIf you care about freedom, you might want the government to respect your freedom to have the kind of family you want. If you care about building more efficient and equitable economies, you might want to look at the implications of that in housing,\u201d he continues. Buterin added that losing site of these bigger questions could lead crypto voters to lose sight of the ideals that \u201coriginally created crypto in the first place.\u201d\n\nIn his view, crypto payments are just one iteration of the decentralization movement\u2019s larger ideological goal of freedom, and a party\u2019s commitment to protecting this goal is what should be on the ballot. \u201cDecentralized networks are good at protecting freedom, and money is an important sphere where such networks can be applied \u2013 but it\u2019s one important sphere among several,\u201d he writes.\n\nAgainst choosing your political allegiances based on who is \"pro-crypto\"https://t.co/rEbRjZYtFB \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 17, 2024\n\nTrump, who has committed to be the \u201ccrypto president,\u201d will speak at Bitcoin 2024 next week, an annual conference that also serves as a tribal gathering for fans of the original cryptocurrency. Details of what he will discuss have not been disclosed. David Bailey, CEO, BTC Inc., the organizer of the Bitcoin Conference, told Fortune in a statement that Trump will \u201cshare his vision for the future of the American Bitcoin industry and its impact on the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nIn his blog post, Buterin also listed examples of technologies that should also be protected in the name of freedom, beyond just crypto and blockchains. This includes encrypted messaging, privacy from centralized AI companies, and prediction markets and Community Notes that he argues help people form \u201chigh-quality opinions about important topics in an adversarial environment.\u201d\n\nButerin\u2019s appeal to higher ideals, however, was quickly met with suggestions he was ignoring political reality.\n\n\u201cMuch of this seems too clever by half. Good crypto policy requires electing pro-crypto candidates, period. Political reality beats idealism every time,\u201d responded prominent crypto layer Jake Chervinsky on X. Another user added, \u201cThe underlying goal has to be mass adoption, which requires good policy. The tech is inherently democratic.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sorry mum\u2019\n\nButerin\u2019s blog comes just one day after Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, co-founders of tech venture capital firm a16z, announced their endorsement of Donald Trump on a podcast. \u201cFor little tech, we think Donald Trump is actually the right choice. Sorry mum, I know you\u2019re going to be mad at me for this, but we had to do it,\u201d Horowitz said. On that same podcast, Andreessen expressed his fears over how the Democrats might regulate Silicon Valley: \u201cMy big concern is what we saw in crypto was the foreshadowing of what\u2019s gonna happen in AI.\u201d\n\nThe a16z founders aren\u2019t the first prominent members of the industry to make their support for Trump public.\n\n\u201cI am going to vote for the person who\u2019s going to do the best job for our economy\u2026I am a voter when it comes to economics, and on that basis, Trump.\u201d ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said during an interview with YouTuber Kevin Paffrath last month.\n\nIn addition, this week it was reported that Tesla CEO and meme coin enthusiast Elon Musk is donating $45 million per month to a new pro-Trump super political action committee, called America PAC. Further donors to the lobbying group include the Winklevoss twins, who founded crypto exchange Gemini, and former U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Kelly Craft, who has lobbied on behalf of the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nProminent crypto figures turning to Trump is also indicative of a wider shift. A June survey by Paradigm found that 13% of Republican swing voters are now more convinced to vote for him in light of his recent crypto conversion. Moreover, just over one third of Republicans view crypto positively, the survey found."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum could break through numerous resistance levels and even enter the path toward an ATH after numerous ETFs might potentially get approved next week. However, staying cautious is still extremely important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe market has been buzzing since 10 Ethereum ETFs, including VanEck Fidelity and Grayscale, have announced their upcoming launches next week. These ETFs may result in large capital inflows into Ethereum, similar to the substantial capital inflows that Bitcoin saw following its approval of ETFs.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs has historically raised investor interest and resulted in significant inflows, which has raised prices. Ethereum's price may see a large increase if Ethereum ETFs exhibit a similar pattern.\n\nJust below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) major resistance level, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,440. In the event that this level is broken, $3,800 could be the next major barrier. If the ETF approvals proceed, the flood of institutional capital could propel Ethereum past this point, perhaps aiming for the psychological $4,000 threshold. But we must approach this optimism cautiously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the market can be unpredictable, there is a good chance of significant inflows. It is possible that some of the expectation of ETF approvals has already been factored in. Further more, there may be a retreat if the approvals are delayed or denied.\n\nThe potential approval of 10 Ethereum ETFs next week could significantly impact Ethereum's price, possibly driving it toward $4,000. If we derive parallels from Bitcoin's ETF-driven inflows, Ethereum might see substantial institutional investments. However, the general sentiment on the market has much more impact on Ethereum or even Bitcoin right now than the potential approval of the ETF."

        "content": "A gaming altcoin built on Ethereum (ETH) is seeing 50% gains after being suddenly listed on top US crypto exchange platform Coinbase.\n\nIn a new post on the social media platform X, Coinbase says it is now listing ETH layer-2 gaming blockchain Ancient8 (A8) with an experiment label, meaning the asset could have low trading volume and high volatility.\n\n\u201cAncient8 is now live on coinbase.com and in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps with the experimental label. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to A8\u2019s official website, the protocol uses Ethereum scaling solution Optimism (OP)\u2019s blockchain to significantly boost performance and lower fees when developing games.\n\n\u201cAs the pioneer gaming ecosystem on the Optimism Superchain, Ancient8 leverages OP Stack Layer2 tech to offer blockchain games the best of Ethereum with no code changes needed, at a significantly lower cost.\u201d\n\nAncient8, which first launched its testnet in 2023, currently features five games: Onchain Clash, Omnizone, MasterDuel, Wee Pepe, and DeWorld. The project says it sees a future where gaming, interoperability, and decentralization seamlessly intertwine.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, Ancient8 aims to strengthen network decentralization and build a robust gaming community. With that goal in mind, we envision a continuously evolving Web3 gaming forefront, where decentralized technology and community collaboration coexist in harmony.\u201d\n\nThe news sent A8 soaring from a 24-hour-low of $0.172 to a 24-hour-high of $0.261, a 51% leap.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Is $3.7K Realistic for ETH or is a Correction to $3K Coming? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following a revival in buying interest and demand, Ethereum\u2019s price has surged, reclaiming the 100 and 200-day moving averages.\n\nThis price action suggests a shift towards a potential rally, with buyers targeting a new yearly high in the mid-term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA detailed analysis of Ethereum\u2019s daily chart reveals that after a notable increase in buying pressure near the substantial $3K support region, the cryptocurrency initiated a bullish spike, surpassing the 100-day ($3340) and 200-day ($3152) moving averages.\n\nAdditionally, ETH has reclaimed the significant resistance region of $3.5K, a crucial barrier for buyers in recent months. This price action indicates a strong buyer presence in the market, aiming for a new yearly high.\n\nHowever, Ethereum has formed a sideways wedge pattern over the recent months. It is expected to continue its upswing after a short-term period of market consolidation, aiming to breach the wedge\u2019s upper boundary at $3.7K. Successfully surpassing this level could lead to a new yearly high above $4K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, an increase in bullish momentum led to an impulsive surge, breaking the multi-month descending trendline.\n\nThis impulsive move also saw the price reclaim the significant $3.3K resistance region, previously filled with supply. This development reflects strong buyer interest in the market, aiming for higher levels in the long run.\n\nHowever, Ethereum reached its prior major swing high in the 4-hour timeframe, resulting in sideways consolidation.\n\nThis swing serves as a robust resistance level, and breaking above it could pave the way for another impulsive surge toward the key $3.7K resistance zone. The ongoing consolidation phase is a positive sign for the market, confirming the recent breakout above the trendline and completing a pullback to it. If the price surpasses its prior central pivot of $3524, the continuation of the bullish movement will become imminent.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has experienced a bullish reversal, a closer examination is essential to determine if the bullish trend will persist. The chart highlights the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, a crucial metric for evaluating futures market sentiment. Values above 1 indicate aggressive buying by bulls, while values below 1 suggest bearish selling pressure.\n\nAs depicted in the chart, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio surged above 1, simultaneously with the bullish revival in Ethereum\u2019s price. This surge indicates strong buying interest in the perpetual market, suggesting a notable bullish sentiment. If this upward trend in the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio continues, it confirms a potential mid-term bullish trend in the market, with the price likely rallying toward higher values."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nMajor crypto investors, or whales, have started to accumulate Ethereum (ETH) in large numbers. This trend emerged over this past week as the ETH price managed to rebound after the crypto crash. This bullish sentiment on the market signals a sustained rebound from the leading altcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the latest data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum has witnessed massive exchange outflows. Around $126 million worth of ETH has been withdrawn from crypto exchanges this week. This means that the Ethereum whales bought huge amounts of coins during this time.\n\nNotably, this strong accumulation trend comes ahead of the potential spot Ethereum ETF launch in the coming days. On July 17, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to the proposed rule changes to list two spot ETFs.\n\nPer the official announcement , applications from two Ethereum ETF filers, ProShares Ethereum ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, were approved by the SEC. These spot Ethereum ETFs were approved to be listed and traded on the NYSE Arca Inc. However, official trading will commence after the approval of the S-1 filings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum price movements\n\nAmid the ETF buzz and strong accumulation trend, the price of Ethereum has dipped 1.48% today. Currently trading at $3,408.57, the price is still up 10.9% over the last seven days. This means that ETH is still in the bullish zone despite today\u2019s slight decrease in its value. Moreover, the broader prospects of ETH are looking optimistic."

Cboe posted new issue notifications Friday afternoon, which are procedural for ETF launches, revealing the Ethereum ETF launch date.\n\nJUST IN: Five Spot Ethereum ETFs to launch on July 23, Cboe confirms.\n\n\n\n\u2022 VanEck\n\n\u2022 Invesco\n\n\u2022 Fidelity\n\n\u2022 21Shares\n\n\u2022 Franklin Templeton \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 19, 2024\n\nCboe will house most of the first trading of Ether ETFs. The exchange has revealed that trading will commence next week. These include the Fidelity Ethereum Fund, the Franklin Ethereum ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, the VanEck Ethereum ETF, and the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. \u201cWe are pleased to announce that 1 Exchange Traded Product (\u2018ETP\u2019) will be listed on Cboe and will begin trading as a new issue on July 23, 2024,\u201d the exchange said.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: Will ETH ETF Have a Bigger Impact Than Bitcoin Did?\n\nHow Are Firms Pricing Their Ethereum ETFs?\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\nEther ETF applicants first received 19b-4 form approvals back in May. However, there has been a delay in wrapping up final loose ends. In addition, firms disclosed fee amounts in amended registration statements on Wednesday:\n\nFidelity set its fee at 0.25% and said it would waive it through the end of 2024.\n\nFranklin Templeton said it will waive its fee until Jan. 31, 2025, on the first $10 billion of the fund\u2019s assets.\n\nVanEck said it will waive its fee for a year after the fund is listed for the first $1.5 billion.\n\n21Shares set a 0.21% fee, which will be waived for six months starting when the shares are listed or during the first $500 million, whichever comes first.\n\nAlso Read: Pepe Coin\u2019s 390% Boom: Next Big Crypto?\n\nFurthermore, an interesting note is the timing of the approval. The SEC is greenlighting the launch date of the Ethereum ETF during the biggest Bitcoin conference of the year. That week will be a memorable one for all of crypto, as BTC and ETH represent the only two cryptocurrencies with an ETF in the US.\n\nNow, all eyes are on what token could be next. There has been a lot of anticipation surrounding a possible Solana ETF soon. Crypto ETFs have entered the spotlight. As a result, the opening week performance of Ether ETFs may dictate how easily the next ETF is approved in the future."

        "content": "ETF issuers are making their final preparations to launch spot Ethereum-based products in the United States next week.\n\nOn July 18, ETF Store president Nate Geraci noted that the final S-1s were in from prospective spot ETH ETF issuers. The Form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the SEC for public companies.\n\nTwo months ago, \u201cjust about everyone thought these had no chance of approval,\u201d he added before predicting that the launch date could be Tuesday, July 23.\n\nLooks like *Final* S-1s now IN from prospective spot eth ETF issuers\u2026 2mos ago, just about everyone thought these had no chance of approval. Next step = launch (sounds like Tues)! \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 17, 2024\n\nETH ETFs Gearing Up\n\nOn July 18, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seffart summarized the offerings from the nine spot Ethereum ETFs that are expected to launch for trading next week. The interesting thing to observe is the fee structure, with the heavyweights BlackRock and Fidelity charging just 0.25% in fees for their yet-to-launch funds.\n\nAs an initial sweetener, BlackRock is issuing a reduction for the first 12 months or $2.5 billion gathered in assets for its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Fidelity stated it would waive fees for its FETH fund until the end of the year. Ark 21Shares and Bitwise are asking for 0.21% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\n\u201cSeven of the 10 ETFs launching are coming out with fee waivers, some waiving the fee completely anywhere from six months to 10 months,\u201d said Seyffart, who added: \u201cThis just shows how competitive these issuers expect things to be \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be a battle to raise assets.\u201d\n\nOkay everyone. Here are the details for the #Ethereum ETFs that we expect to launch next week.

The firm has stated that 10% of its spot Ethereum ETF will establish its Ethereum Mini Trust, providing $1 billion in seed funding.\n\nHodl Capital estimated that a similar exodus from Grayscale\u2019s ETHE fund could be as much as $10 billion in AUM.\n\nWill Grayscale replicate the $GBTC fee mistake with $ETHE?

The asset was trading just over $3,400 at the time of writing, having fallen from a 17-day high of $3,500 yesterday.\n\nThere may be a little pump if and when ETFs go live, but it is likely that prices have already been factored in."

        "content": "Grayscale's Ethereum Trust fee could spark outflows, canceling out potential inflows across Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum Foundation-related wallet has been dumping ETH on exchanges.\n\nEthereum could see a new all-time high if it moves above a key resistance.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down 0.4.% on Thursday following speculations surrounding the potential negative impact of Grayscale's Ethereum Trust fees and ETH dump from the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Grayscale's fee, Ethereum Foundation dump\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust 2.5% fee has left many ETHE holders fuming as the asset manager maintained the high fee structure it applied to Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSeveral analysts predicted that the move may see Grayscale's Ethereum Trust suffer increased outflow similar to its Bitcoin counterpart when ETH ETFs go live. As a result, it could cancel out potential inflows in other Ethereum ETFs, reducing the upward impact on ETH's price.\n\nEthereum ETF issuers filed their final S-1 registration statements on Wednesday, revealing fees for their respective products. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also approved 19b-4 filings of Grayscale's Mini Trust and ProShares Ethereum ETFs, two of the latest additions to the ten funds potentially launching on Tuesday.\n\nBloomberg Ethereum ETFs List\n\nMeanwhile, an Ethereum Foundation-related wallet, 0xdbe, is suspected of dumping ETH following the recent price dip after depositing 1,602 ETH worth $5.48 million to Kraken in the past few hours, according to Spot On Chain.\n\nSince June 8, 0xdbe has been dumping ETH on exchanges, potentially selling 19,488 ETH worth about $70.6 million. As revealed in the chart below, a decline followed its three large sales.\n\nPnL overview\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum could rally above the $4,093 yearly high\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,400, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours. The move has seen ETH liquidations reach $30.90 million, with long and short liquidations accounting for $22.08 million and $8.82 million, respectively.\n\nSince the crypto market recovery, Ethereum's Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has been in an uptrend, according to CryptoQuant's data.\n\nETH Taker Buy/Sell Ratio\n\nThe Taker Buy/Sell Ratio estimates the dominant sentiment among futures traders. Values above 1 suggest bullish pressure is dominant, while values below 1 indicate bearish pressure.\n\nIf the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio uptrend continues, ETH will likely ride the bullish wave further. And with spot Ethereum ETFs set for a potential Tuesday launch, ETH bears could see heavy liquidations.\n\nOn the upside, ETH faces resistance around $3,977, a level it has failed to overcome since descending from its yearly high of $4,093 in March. ETH options data also shows several call options with a strike price of $4,000. Hence, prices are likely to tilt towards this level in the long run.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nA successful move above this resistance level could see ETH rally to a new all-time high in the coming months. On the downside, ETH may find support around the $3,000 psychological level.\n\nETH could drop to $3,360 in the short term, where $24.39 million long positions risk liquidation."

        "content": "Grayscale took a strategic step by cutting its proposed fee for its spot Ethereum ETH/USD ETF by a significant 40%, thereby trying to gain an edge over competitors in the imminent asset race.\n\nWhat Happened: Grayscale revised its intended sponsor fee for the Ethereum Mini Trust to 0.15%, a substantial drop from the initially proposed 0.25% fee, The Block reported. The full waiver is at $2 billion. The original fee was on par with similar offerings by BlackRock and Fidelity, as well as a proposed fund by Invesco and Galaxy.\n\nThe revised fee now undercuts rival funds by Franklin Templeton (0.19%), VanEck (0.20%), Bitwise (0.20%) and 21Shares (0.21%).\n\nGrayscale is gearing up to convert its Ethereum Trust ETHE \u2014 which currently manages about $10 billion in assets \u2014 into an ETF. The fee for this product is expected to remain at 2.5%. The firm has structured its Mini Ethereum Trust such that 10% of ETHE's ether holdings are channelled into the cheaper product.\n\nScot Johnsson, partner at VB Capital, thinks the fund make a smart decision:\n\nLowered to 15 bps, with full waiver for first $2 bn.

The impact of this fee reduction on Grayscale\u2019s market position and the broader investment market will be closely watched in the coming days.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: The influence of Ethereum as an institutional asset class is expected to be thoroughly explored at Benzinga\u2019s upcoming Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

Indeed, BTC became the first crypto to get spot ETF approval in the United States, breaking the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) rejection streak in January.\n\nThere is no denying the impact that Bitcoin had on the market after its debut. Just three months after launch, the leading crypto surged to a $73,000 price, setting a new all-time high mark. Yet, one expert predicts that the upcoming crypto ETF could actually be more impressive.\n\nSource: Watcher.Guru\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs Expected to Officially Launch July 23\n\nEthereum ETF to Have a Bigger Impact Than BTC?\n\nEarlier this month, Kraken\u2019s head of strategy, Thomas Perfumo, told Bloomberg that Ethereum\u2019s ETF was a \u201crising tide lifts all boats,\u201d situation. He reinforces the importance of the arrival, and what it means for crypto. Now many have wondered if the Ethereum ETF could actually have a bigger impact than its Bitcoin counterpart.\n\nOne such person who believes in its potential is Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a recent report, the executive highlighted what the crypto market could expect from the product. Moreover, he discussed how it could be the biggest crypto-based ETF yet.\n\n\u201cThe first few weeks could be choppy, as money may flow out of $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) after it converts to an ETP,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cBy year-end, I\u2019m confident the new highs will be in,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read: Bitwise Says SEC is Open to Solana ETF After Ethereum Launch\n\nAfter discussing the impact that Bitcoin had on the market, Hougan asked if ETh could \u201csee the same sort of impact,\u201d when it arrives. He answered, saying he thinks, \u201cIt might be bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the new Ethereum ETPs will attract billions. And I think the money flowing into these new ETPs will have a bigger impact than it did with Bitcoin,\u201d he stated. Hougan notes that lower short-term inflation rates and ETH staking play a role. It will be interesting to observe, as crypto could be heading toward a monumental bull rally."

        "content": "Shiba Inu and Ethereum have become some of the most important players in the cryptocurrency market. We\u2019re not surprised about this fact.\n\nThis analysis examines their current positions, recent performance, and future price predictions to understand how they will evolve.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu or Pepe Coin: Which Cryptocurrency Can Reach $0.01 First?\n\nUnderstanding Crypto Market Trends Through Shiba Inu and Ethereum\n\nCurrent Market Positions\n\nOn July 17th of this year, Shiba Inu (SHIB) traded at $0.00001930, with a market capitalization of $9,477,145,257. Amazing, right? Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is priced at $3,489.79.\n\nRecent Performance\n\nShiba Inu has experienced some unexpected price changes over the past year. The chart shows a spike in early 2024, which was then followed by a correction. Despite this volatility, SHIB has kept a relatively stable price recently.\n\nThe Ethereum Price chart shown above shows a more consistent growth over the same period. The cryptocurrency has shown an upward trend since early 2024, with some occasional fluctuations.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs Expected to Officially Launch July 23\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s indicators show the 50-day SMA is at $0.00001999, while the 200-day SMA is a bit lower, at $0.00001962. This close value suggests that its price is hovering around moving averages. Furthermore, the 14-day RSI is at 56.63.\n\nEthereum\u2019s indicators show a more bullish trend: The 50-day SMA stands at $3,447.97, and the 200-day SMA is lower at $3,105.22. This difference suggests that its price is trending above the long-term moving average.\n\nPrice Predictions\n\nShiba Inu Price Predictions\n\n5-Day: $0.00004291\n\n1-Month: $0.00001867\n\n3-Month: $0.00001703\n\n6-Month: $0.00001731\n\n1-Year: $0.00003633\n\n2025: $0.00002083\n\nThe price predictions for Shiba Inu show a mixed outlook. In the short term, a significant spike is expected during the next 5 days. This might be caused by market speculation of upcoming events.\n\nUnfortunately, this surge is most likely going to be short-lived, with decreases forecasted for the one-month, three-month, and six-month periods.\n\nThe long-term outlook looks more positive, with a large increase predicted for the 1-year mark.\n\nEthereum price predictions\n\n5-Day: $3,590.26\n\n1-Month: $3,613.70\n\n3-Month: $4,590.75\n\n6-Month: $5,743.92\n\n1-Year: $6,370.35\n\n2025: $5,580.19\n\nEthereum\u2019s price predictions are more bullish than SHIB, and that is obvious at this stage. The forecast suggests steady growth across all time frames, with an important boost in the three-month and six-month periods. That\u2019s very interesting.\n\nThis positive outlook is due to Ethereum\u2019s strong fundamentals and the development of network upgrades.\n\nThe 1-year prediction also shows that it might continue to grow. Even if the 2025 prediction is lower than the 1-year forecast, it still represents a large increase from the current price.\n\nThe price predictions for Shiba Inu and Ethereum show different paths. Even though Ethereum has a constant positive outlook, Shiba Inu is more volatile and has short- and long-term growth potential."

        "content": "Bitcoin price experiences rejection as it meets resistance around the $65,000 level.\n\nEthereum price faces resistance at $3,530, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.\n\nRipple price could pause to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $0.480 before continuing the bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices encountered rejections upon reaching resistance levels near $65,000 and $3,530, respectively. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) price might undergo a pullback towards the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.480 before potentially resuming its upward momentum.\n\nBitcoin price poised for pullback after retesting daily resistance at $65,000\n\nBitcoin price faced resistance near the daily level of $64,913 on Tuesday, leading to a 2% decline over the next two days. As of Friday, it is trading slightly lower by 0.25% at $63,819.\n\nThis level aligns closely with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $64,921, derived from the swing high of $71,997 on June 7 to the swing low of $53,475 on July 5, establishing a critical zone of resistance to monitor closely.\n\nSideline buyers seeking opportunities can consider positions between the $59,200 and $57,800 levels, where the previously broken trendline resistance now serves as support.\n\nIf BTC bounces off the $59,200 level, it could rise 9% to restest its daily resistance at $64,913.\n\nOn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) reinforce the noted rebound, with both indicators positioned above their neutral thresholds of 50 and zero, respectively. This robust momentum signals a strong bullish sentiment in the market.\n\nFurthermore, surpassing the $64,913 level could allow an additional 3.5% rise to retest its next weekly resistance at $67,209.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, a close below $56,405 for BTC, accompanied by a formation of a lower low on the daily timeframe, could indicate sustained bearish sentiment. Such a scenario might precipitate a 7.5% decline in Bitcoin's price, potentially leading to a retest of its daily support level at $52,266.\n\nEthereum price encounters barrier at $3,530 mark\n\nEthereum price faces rejection at $3,530, 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level derived from the swing high of $3,977 on May 27 to the swing low of $2,808 on July 5. This level aligns closely with the daily high of $3,524 from July 1, establishing a critical zone of resistance to monitor closely. As of Friday, it trades slightly down 0.39% at $3,415.\n\nIf the $3,240 level holds as support, where the previously breached trendline resistance now acts as a supportive barrier, ETH could rise 8.6% to revisit its daily high of $3,524, set on July 1.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is trading above the neutral level of 50, and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is on its way to doing the same. If bulls are indeed making a comeback, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective mean levels. Such a development would add a tailwind to the recovery rally.\n\nIf the bulls are aggressive and the overall crypto market outlook is positive, ETH could close above the $3,524 level, extending an additional rally of 5.3% to retest its daily high set on June 9 at $3,721.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick closes below $2,808, forming a lower low in the daily timeframe, it may signal persistent bearish sentiment. This scenario could trigger a 7% decline in Ethereum's price, targeting a revisit of its daily support at $2,621.\n\nRipple price could resume rally if retest of key support at $0.480 succeeds\n\nRipple price broke above the daily resistance level at $0.499 on July 13 and rallied 20% over the next four days. Such strong upward momentum often precedes a retracement, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors on the sidelines. As of Friday, it trades 3% down at $0.548 level.\n\nSideline buyers seeking opportunities can consider positions at $0.480, its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, derived from the swing low of $0.382 on July 5 to the swing high of $0.638 on July 17.\n\nIf XRP bounces off the $0.480 level, it could rally 33% to retest its daily high from April 9 at $0.643.\n\nOn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently above the overbought level at 70, which supports the pullback above thesis. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is above the mean level of zero. These momentum indicators strongly indicate bullish dominance.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if Ripple's daily candlestick closes below $0.413, it indicates sustained bearish sentiment, forming a lower low in the daily timeframe. Such a scenario could lead to a 16% decline in Ripple's price, targeting a revisit of its low from March 12 at $0.347."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP is in the process of correction as its price printed a 7% drop in the last 24 hours, potentially pushing the market to its first major correction. However, it could be temporary, and things could turn bullish again in a few days.\n\nThe 50-day moving average is the first major support level for XRP. If XRP remains above this barrier, it may level off and even rise once more. As a psychological barrier for traders, this level has historically served as a foundation for price rebounds. The support level at $0.50 is followed by the 100-day moving average. In the past, during downtrends, it has provided solid support. If XRP drops below $0.55, this level may act as a safety net to stop further losses.\n\nTraders frequently scan these levels for opportunities to buy, which could aid in a price reversal. Recovering from a drop below the 200 EMA level may indicate a longer-term bearish trend for XRP. Sustaining this level is critical to XRP's bullish outlook, as it is regarded as a long-term trend indicator.\n\nEthereum can't break it\n\nEthereum could not break the 50 EMA resistance level and is currently sliding below the moving average. Unfortunately, the lack of a breakthrough will lead us to a drop below $3,300. There are a few levels for traders to watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum encountered significant resistance during its most recent attempt to breach the 50 EMA, suggesting that bearish momentum may be developing. A critical technical indicator, the 50 EMA frequently acts as a level of support or resistance. The failure of an asset to cross this threshold may signal waning bullish sentiment and potential losses.\n\nThe 50 EMA has consistently demonstrated its ability to predict market trends. Ethereum frequently retraces its losses when it is unable to rise above this level. This pattern implies that there may be more selling pressure on the market in the near term.\n\nIt is critical to avoid a drop below the $3,000 barrier. Ethereum may experience panic selling if it drops below that barrier, which would accelerate the decline. It has historically served as both support and resistance.\n\nThe amount of $3,200 represents yet another crucial support level. This threshold has previously been tested several times and has frequently served as a buffer against additional declines. Ethereum must stay at this level in order to stabilize and prevent a more severe correction. The 200 EMA acts as a longer-term support at around $3,200. That is why long-term investors need to keep an eye on this level, as a decline below it might signal a longer bearish phase.\n\nToncoin does not attract bulls\n\nToncoin's success was enormous during the market downturn, but as soon as the majority of digital assets retraced, TON quickly lost most of its momentum and even dropped below the crucial 50 EMA support.\n\nCertain investors have perceived Toncoin as a possible hedge against the larger cryptocurrency market, notwithstanding its recent performance. Due in large part to its integration with the Telegram ecosystem, this thesis's strength lies in its foundation.\n\nOne of the main benefits of Toncoin is its integration with Telegram. Telegram offers TON an audience that is already there and the chance to be widely adopted thanks to its enormous user base. TON may be more resilient than other cryptocurrencies due to this fundamental strength, particularly in times of market turbulence.\n\nIn times of market turbulence, investors frequently seek investments that offer some degree of stability. Its ability to function as a more stable investment was demonstrated by Toncoin's performance during the market slump.\n\nTON is not totally immune to larger market movements, though, as seen by the most recent decline below the 50 EMA support level. The support of a significant platform such as Telegram, and Toncoin's strong technological base, contribute to its increasing popularity.\n\nInvestors seeking long-term stability over short-term gains may be drawn to this strength. The theory is that despite difficulties facing the market as a whole, Toncoin's strong fundamentals will enable it to weather storms better than its competitors."

        "content": "Eric Balchunas, a renowned financial analyst, recently expressed skepticism about the potential success of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum ETH/USD spot ETF due to its high fee structure.\n\nWhat Happened: Grayscale submitted updated S-1 filings with the SEC Wednesday, revealing the all-important information about the fund management fee. The digital asset management giant will charge 2.5% for its Grayscale Ethereum Trust, significantly higher than its competitors. A miniature version of the fund, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, will however charge 0.25%.\n\nBalchunas questioned these moves, asking whether the 0.25% fee would be low enough to attract sufficient organic flows to offset what he referred to as \u201cThe Big Unlock\u201d.\n\nHe further speculated on the ability of new entrants to the market to counterbalance the predicted outflows due to the flagship version\u2019s high fees, drawing a parallel with Bitcoin BTC/USD. \u201cAnyway short story is the 2.5% fee made path to a decent net flow number a little harder,\u201d Balchunas feared.\n\nCheap but not sure cheap enough to move the needle (as most are cheaper and brand name BlackRock is same fee) to attract organic flows to offset The Big Unlock. And do these newborns have enough strength to offset those outflows a la btc. Anyway short story is the 2.5% fee made\u2026 https://t.co/0sH0tXrjtL \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 17, 2024\n\nAnother well-known ETF expert, Nate Geraci, called this a \u201chuge miss\u201d by Grayscale, indicating that the mini trust should have been priced much lower. \u201cEntire pricing strategy around both spot BTC & ETH ETFs seems focused on maximizing short-term revenue vs playing long game,\u201d Geraci stated.\n\nBtw, think this is *huge* miss by Grayscale\u2026\n\n\n\nIf you're gonna charge *2.5%* on ETHE, need to undercut market w/ mini trust.\n\n\n\nDisappointing.\n\n\n\nEntire pricing strategy around both spot btc & eth ETFs seems focused on maximizing short-term revenue vs playing long game. https://t.co/8DE1UIlCIo \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 17, 2024\n\nSee Also: Mark Cuban: Trump\u2019s Re-Election Won\u2019t Directly Impact Bitcoin\u2019s Price\n\nWhy It Matters: These criticisms come even as other funds, including the one by BlackRock, are priced much lower. The ishares Ethereum Trust will charge 0.25%, and so will the ETFs by Fidelity and Invesco.\n\nGrayscale, which already operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, faced significant outflows pressure after launch due to its 1.5% fees, highest among all spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since launch, it has recorded net outflows of $18.69 billion as of this writing, according to SoSo Value.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s flagship Ethereum Trust, along with the mini Trust, are expected to go live for trading by July 23.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum was exchanging hands at $3,423.79, down 1.55% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nIllustration via Shutterstock.\n\nRead Next:"

        "content": "Developers continued to work on Plectra upgrade for the Ethereum network.\n\nChanges in staking rewards were discussed to mitigate centralization and other risks to the network.\n\nApart from the market recovery, the increasing attention around Ethereum [ETH] has helped it soar over the past few days. The upcoming Plectra update could further help Ethereum see green.\n\nDevelopers continue with their work\n\nIn the 137th All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call, the primary focus was on the progress of two testnets, Pectra Devnet 1 and PeerDAS Devnet 1.\n\nPectra Devnet 1 is nearing its launch, with both Consensus Layer (CL) and Execution Layer (EL) clients prepared. The Ethereum Foundation DevOps team is rigorously testing various client combinations to ensure compatibility and stability.\n\nPeerDAS Devnet 1 is currently undergoing bug fixes before its planned relaunch. Once these issues are resolved, the devnet is expected to be restarted by the end of the week.\n\nIn addition to testnet updates, the call also covered research on fork choice testing by the TxRX team at Consensys. Their newly developed test generator aims to identify potential bugs and deviations in client software from CL specifications.\n\nThe successful launch of Pectra Devnet 1 is a significant step towards the Pectra upgrade, which is expected to introduce several improvements to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe ongoing development of the fork choice test generator is crucial for enhancing the reliability and security of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNew changes for stakers\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum is also considering adjusting its staking rewards to maintain a lower staking rate, potentially around 25% or 12.5%.\n\nThis change could have a substantial impact on the returns ETH holders receive from staking. The Ethereum Foundation is exploring this option to address several concerns.\n\nA lower staking rate is seen as a way to mitigate the risk of centralization, where a significant portion of ETH becomes concentrated in a few large staking pools.\n\nThis centralization could potentially threaten the network\u2019s security and decentralization.\n\nAdditionally, a lower staking rate might reduce the likelihood of a mass slashing event leading to a chain split, a scenario where ETH holders might pressure the protocol to restore lost funds.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,455.17 and its price had grown by 1.16% in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent surge in price, the network growth for the Ethereum token had declined, suggesting that new addresses were slowly losing interest in the ETH token.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nMoreover, the velocity at which ETH was trading at had also fallen significantly, implying that the frequency at which ETH was trading at had also fallen.\n\nIf these trends continue, ETH\u2019s chances of rallying further would diminish even further."

Interstingly, the exploiter still holds $12-$15 million worth of other altcoins including CHR, CELR, OOKI, and FRONT.\n\nIt seems that the WazirX hacker is also betting on the upcoming Ethereum price rally as the spot Ether ETFs will go live for trading next week.

Market analysts are predicting ETH to rally to $4,000 and beyond in the weeks following the ETF launch.\n\nThe technical chart setup for Ethereum also looks bullish at this stage.

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum (ETH) surged past $3,500, reaching a high of $3,517 on July 17 before settling at $3,463. Analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s potential to hit new all-time highs, driven by several bullish factors.\n\nThe upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs next week could drive the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency to unprecedented levels, potentially surpassing $5,500, according to Bitwise.\n\nAlthough immediate price movements may be volatile \u2014 partly due to expected capital outflows from the $11 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) as it transitions to an ETF\u2014 Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan, remains positive.\n\nMeanwhile, following earlier coverage by CNF on the US SEC delaying its decision on Ethereum ETFs filed by BlackRock, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton, Grayscale has now filed with the US SEC to register shares of a new Ethereum ETF named Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, as announced in a recent Grayscale post.\n\nIn addition, the ETF would be created by spinning off and distributing shares from the existing Grayscale Ethereum Trust. James Seyffart, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst, stated that the mini fluid \u201cshould help alleviate some of the likely Grayscale outflows\u201d expected from the conversion of the larger fund.\n\nSeyffart believes that the mini Ethereum ETF will launch simultaneously with the other ETFs. Ethereum will initially be seeded with 10% of ETH assets. This should help mitigate some of the anticipated outflows from Grayscale.

        "content": "Ethereum price forecast shows that the asset remained stagnant in the past day. This comes as the WazirX hacker converted his loot into ETH. At 2:53 a.m. UTC, the attacker had accumulated $201.67 million in ETH. If the hacker, who on-chain sleuth ZachXBT suggests may be linked to the Lazarus Group, decides to sell his ETH, what will the market implications be?\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Can $200M ETH Dump Upstage ETF Launch in 3 Days?\n\nEthereum price forecast remains stable despite the WazirX hacker consolidating the stolen crypto assets into Ethereum, probably because the Ethereum blockchain is the most liquid. ETH/USD price is trending above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe, which confirms that the bullish uptrend is still intact.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH is also inside a symmetrical triangle, forming a bullish pennant. The price of ETH is expected to trend inside this market structure over the weekend and into next week.\n\nTechnical indicators reveal some weakness from bulls, but the Ethereum price forecast remains optimistic.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) hit 60.68 on July 15 before retracing downward. It is currently near the RSI moving average, which may offer support from which to bounce. The current 57.49 RSI reveals ETH\u2019s bullish momentum is decreasing. The Chaikin money flow (CMF) indicator supports the RSI, barely above the zero line, and shows signs of reducing buying pressure.\n\nEthereum price prediction shows the asset may bounce off between $3,400 and $3,500 over the weekend. A break to the upside of the symmetrical triangle may result in an 18% price upswing to $4,100. Conversely, the ETH price may find support at $3,300.\n\nETH ETF vs Sell-Off: Which Will Take the Day?\n\nWazirX hacker\u2019s intentions with the accumulated Ethereum are unknown for now. However, the market anticipates that the attacker may dump the loot at any moment. The news of the hack comes days before the launch of the Ethereum ETF on July 23.\n\nMeanwhile, ETF issuers filed their S-1 final drafts on Wednesday, with Grayscale charging the highest fees. However, on Friday, the ETF issuer dropped its starting fee to 0.15% and will now be the cheapest, surpassing Franklin Templeton at 0.19%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe crypto market is on edge as the WazirX hacker\u2019s potential sell-off of $202 million in Ethereum looms. This significant amount of ETH hitting the market could trigger a gloomy Ethereum price forecast, potentially leading to a broader market crash and upstaging the anticipated Ethereum ETF launch.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. How much was stolen in the recent WazirX hack? The recent hack of the WazirX cryptocurrency exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $235 million. This includes significant amounts of various cryptocurrencies, such as $96.7 million in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and $52 million in Ether (ETH). 2. How will the Grayscale Ethereum Trust fee waiver affect ETH ETFs? Grayscale has announced a full fee waiver for their Ethereum Mini Trust for up to $2 billion in inflows or for the first six months, whichever comes first. This reduction makes the Ethereum Mini Trust significantly more competitive in the market, aligning it with other low-fee or zero-fee promotional offers from competing Ethereum ETFs. 3. Will Ethereum price soar past $5,000? There is still high likelyhood that Ethereum price will soar above $5,000 in the coming days especially after the launch of spot ETH ETFs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

This ratio has experienced notable spikes above the value of 1 in recent weeks, indicating shifts in market dynamics.\n\nA Taker Buy Sell Ratio above 1 is a strong indicator of aggressive purchasing by bulls.

This reduction may imply a temporary easing of buying pressure or an increase in selling activity.\n\nHowever, should the upward trend in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio resume, CryptoQuant suggests it could confirm a potential mid-term bullish trend for Ethereum.\n\nThis would likely lead to further price increases as bullish sentiment sustains and intensifies in the market.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Open Interest shaping up\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s Open Interest on Coinglass indicated a significant uptick in the last few days. Starting around the 9th of July, the Open Interest increased from approximately $12 billion to over $14.2 billion.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a sharp rise in Ethereum\u2019s Funding Rate.\n\nA rise in the Funding Rate typically indicates that long positions are paying premiums to short positions, suggesting bullish sentiment among traders holding long positions.\n\nThese developments \u2014 the rise in Open Interest and the higher Funding Rate \u2014 suggest increased market activity and cash inflow from buyers.\n\nThis aligned with other bullish indicators like the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, painting a picture of a strong bullish trend for Ethereum.\n\nETH\u2019s growing bull trend\n\nAs of press time, Ethereum was trading at approximately $3,436, marking a less than 1% increase.\n\nThis subtle rise followed a more significant increase of over 1% in the previous trading session, which pushed its price to around $3,425.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Ethereum\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) provided further insight into its market behavior.

The Ethereum [ETH] launch is set for 23rd July, according to a renowned crypto analyst. This milestone comes after Bitcoin\u2019s ETF success.\n\nAmidst these developments, VanEck\u2019s recent filing for a Solana ETF has intensified market anticipation.\n\nSolana in the Spotlight\n\nAs Ethereum takes center stage, Solana [SOL] emerges as the next potential ETF candidate. Known for its speed and low costs, Solana could be the third major crypto to secure an ETF.\n\nThis prospect has already boosted Solana\u2019s market position and investor interest.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, recently replied to an ETF approval week tweet and added more fuel to the Ethereum ETF launch speculations. In the tweet, he stated that the the launch could be on 23rd July.\n\nSocial buzz and whale activity\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Solana\u2019s social volume data shows recent stability with a slight downward trend.\n\nHowever, whale holdings have increased since January. The total supply held by whales stood at 42% of the total supply at press time.\n\nThis indicated strong institutional interest despite waning social volume trends, which may result from Ethereum stealing public attention.\n\nSolana correlation insights\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the Hyblock buy volume in the last two years indicated that the correlation between Ethereum and Solana stood at 0.44. This suggests a moderately positive relationship between the two giants.\n\nThe connection could benefit SOL as Ethereum\u2019s ETF launch approaches, potentially driving increased interest in both assets.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the SOL Profit Calculator\n\nAt press time, Solana was trading around $160.79, forming a bullish pennant pattern. The recent breakout above key resistance signals potential for further gains.\n\nIf it breaks through the bullish pennant resistance, the rally will continue. Both the RSI and MACD indicators support an optimistic bullish outlook."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF potential launch on 23 July sparks excitement\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has set a timeline for the launch of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has set a timeline for the launch of Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. The major date to note is 23rd July, when these ETFs are expected to start trading in the US. This announcement marks a significant development for both the cryptocurrency space and the broader financial markets. By establishing a concrete timeline, the SEC is finally opening the doors for a new wave of institutional and retail investments in Ethereum. This move follows the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, which saw substantial inflows and market interest.\n\nThe latest update from the SEC indicates that fund issuers have been asked to submit their final S-1 forms by Wednesday, including all necessary fee details. This step is crucial as it ensures that all required information is available for public scrutiny. By Monday, July 22nd, issuers must request the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of their registration forms, which essentially activates the ETFs. If the SEC does not intervene with any unexpected issues, trading will commence on July 23rd. This structured process reflects the meticulous regulatory process involved in launching an ETF.\n\nAs we await the final S-1 filings, fees remain a hot topic. The cost of investing in these ETFs can significantly impact their attractiveness to investors. The race is heating up with asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, 21Shares, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy all submitting their final S-1 filings. The filings revealed management fees, with Grayscale setting a high fee of 2.5% for its main product but 0.25% for its Mini Ethereum Trust. BlackRock and Fidelity will charge 0.25%, while 21Shares set a fee of 0.21%. Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy are at 0.2%, and Franklin Templeton at 0.19%. ProShares has yet to disclose its fee at the time of writing.\n\nMarket sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year brought in $16 billion in net inflows and boosted Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, experts and investors have tempered their expectations for the Ethereum ETFs due to potential volatility and current market conditions. Still, many see significant potential for inflows and price appreciation over time. They view this as a pivotal moment for the broader crypto market.\n\nExcitement builds as the final S-1 submission deadline draws near. If the documents meet all necessary conditions, major issuers can roll out their ETFs together. This could pave the way for other crypto ETFs, like those for Solana, for which VanEck already filed a few weeks ago. With July 23 approaching, the market will closely observe the performance of these new ETFs and their influence on cryptocurrency investments. This launch could be a pivotal moment in integrating digital assets into mainstream financial markets."

It remains to be seen whether this will continue in the days ahead.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nETH/USD is stable in the past 24 hours.\n\nEven so, the coin is up 20% from this month\u2019s low, and prices are in a bullish formation above $3,300.\n\nTechnically, as long as prices are still inside the bull bar of July 15, every dip might offer entries for traders targeting $3,700.\n\nThis outlook is valid from an effort-versus-result perspective, mainly if losses occur with relatively low trading volume.\n\nAny sharp close below $3,200 will cancel out this bullish preview, questioning the strength of buyers."

ETH declined below the $3,450 and $3,440 support levels to enter a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin.\n\nThere was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $3,420 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even spiked below $3,400 and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,048 swing low to the $3,516 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $3,380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

        "content": "Grayscale is preparing for a Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds\u2019 (ETFs) spinoff on July 23 and 31.\n\nIn a recent thread on X, James Seyffart, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, provided an in-depth explanation of Grayscale\u2019s upcoming Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF spinoffs.\n\nDoing a thread on the situation for @Grayscale's spinoff for $ETHE & $ETH because I've gotten about a million questions on it. The mechanics will be essentially the same for $GBTC & $BTC spinoff. If you own 1,000 shares of $ETHE, you should receive 1,000 shares of mini $ETH. 1/ pic.twitter.com/Er66mj5L46 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 19, 2024\n\nThese spinoffs, set to launch later this month, aim to offer lower-fee options for investors. Seyffart clarified the mechanics and timelines, responding to numerous inquiries about the spinoffs. For the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), the spinoff will occur on July 23, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) will spin off on July 31.\n\nAdditionally, the spinoffs will function similarly: every share of the original fund gets a corresponding share in the new mini-fund. Seyffart further explained that to qualify, shareholders must own the relevant shares by the record date, which was July 18 for ETHE and will be July 30 for GBTC.\n\nHow will Grayscale\u2019s spinoff affect investors?\n\nGrayscale\u2019s blog post on spin-offs outlines how the process will affect shareholders. A spin-off is essentially a portion of a larger product moved out to create a smaller, independent product. This new, lower-cost product aims to cater to diverse investment needs while maintaining the total value of an investor\u2019s assets. Shareholders don\u2019t need to take any action; they will automatically receive the new shares, which might take several days to reflect in their accounts post-distribution.\n\nSelect Grayscale products may be undergoing a spin-off in the near future \ud83d\ude09 Not sure what that means? Read our blog and watch our informational video here for what you need to know.https://t.co/RXUkx8GWJb pic.twitter.com/oiNWn0pCfw \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) July 18, 2024\n\nGrayscale reasons that these spin-offs allow investors greater choice. This strategy helps existing shares gain the same value spread across the original and new funds, promoting more flexibility and potentially lower fees. Specifically, the Bitcoin Mini Trust will offer fees as low as 0.15%, compared to GBTC\u2019s current 1.5% fee.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s market strategy\n\nGrayscale\u2019s move to spin-off the mini trusts is a maneuver to cope better with competition and current market conditions. As reported by The Block in April, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Mini Trust aims to charge the lowest rate in the industry at 0.15%. In contrast, high fees of up to 1.5% are currently associated with GBTC. This aggressive adjustment positions Grayscale advantageously against competitors like BlackRock and Fidelity, whose funds have attracted considerable inflows.\n\nFurthermore, Seyffart noted that comparable pricing actions would be visible for the ETH mini trust, which will likely trade at a fraction of the typical price due to the smaller fund structure. With these spinoffs, Grayscale expects to democratize market access, making it less costly for investors to get involved in these digital assets.\n\nImplications for Grayscale and broader market dynamics\n\nGrayscale\u2019s strategic shift to mini-trusts comes amidst industry-wide trends of reducing fees for better investor appeal. As highlighted in Reuters\u2018 March report, the company\u2019s legal fight with the SEC paved the way for the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. This change has been significant, with an influx of investments observed in lower-fee ETFs like those managed by BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nThe strategic acumen displayed by Grayscale through these spin-offs might reinvigorate their standing in the market. Strong competition and investor demand for lower fees highlight the intense dynamism within the ETF space\u2014evidence of which can be seen in Lookonchain\u2019s reports showing mixed ETF flows and fluctuating investor confidence.\n\nOverall, Grayscale\u2019s anticipated Bitcoin and Ethereum mini trust ETFs symbolize not just a tactical shift but a broader evolution within the crypto ETF landscape. By offering a lower-cost alternative, Grayscale may well solidify its leadership status in the crypto-focused asset management arena. Investors will be keen to see how these developments unfold in the coming weeks."
