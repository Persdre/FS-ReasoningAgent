        "title": "What is EIP-7251 (MaxEB) in Ethereum? A Beginner\u2019s Guide - Unchained",
        "content": "EIP-7251, also known as MaxEB, is an improvement proposal for Ethereum that aims to address the issue of redundant network validators.\n\nThe growth of Ethereum has led to the continued increase of validators who participate in the network\u2019s consensus process. Ethereum researchers have expressed concerns about the potential instability in the network due to the continued increase of validator sets.\n\nRead on as we discuss EIP-7251 and its role in addressing these concerns.\n\nWhat Is EIP-7251 (MaxEB)?\n\nEIP-7251, or MaxEB, is an improvement proposal for the Ethereum network that aims to address the issue of \u2018redundant validators.\u2019\n\nEIP-7251 proposes lifting the maximum amount a validator can stake from the current 32 ETH to 2048 ETH while maintaining the minimum staking balance limit at 32 ETH.\n\nThe goal is to allow large node operators to consolidate their validator sets, potentially reducing the number of validators and increasing the network\u2019s efficiency. Validators won\u2019t have to fully exit and re-enter the protocol to merge their effective balances.\n\nFor solo stakers, EIP-7251 will enable them to earn compounding rewards and stake their ether in more flexible increments. For example, a large node operator with 2048 ETH can consolidate 64 validator sets into one, while a solo staker with a 45 ETH balance only has to dedicate resources to one validator set.\n\nAs of March 2024, the Ethereum network has over 950,000 validator sets. Theoretically, this means the network is truly decentralized. However, while the network recognizes each validator as a unique entity, a party can run several validators on the same device.\n\nEIP-7251 proposes lifting the maximum effective balance limit to allow consolidation and accurately reflect the network\u2019s decentralization levels.\n\nHow Does EIP-7251 Work?\n\nEIP-7251 proposes to reduce the number of validators while maintaining high economic security on the Ethereum network.\n\nEIP-7251 relies on four key features that make it work:\n\nCreating a minimum balance and increasing the maximum balance: EIP-7251 proposes creating a minimum activation balance of 32 ETH and increasing the maximum effective balance from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH.\n\nCombination of multiple validator sets: With the increased maximum limit, large node operators combine their validators without cycling through the exit and activation queues. This helps speed up the staking process while decreasing costs due to the in-protocol consolidation.\n\nAdding execution layer partial withdrawals: Execution layer messages trigger partial withdrawals in addition to full exits. For example, a validator with 200 ETH staked can remove 50 ETH without exiting. This increases the flexibility of staking configurations, allowing validators to control the moment and amount they withdraw.\n\nCustom effective balance ceiling: EIP-7251 enables validators to customize the maximum amount that activates partial withdrawals.\n\nReasons For and Against MaxEB\n\nThere are several compelling reasons to make the case to increase the maximum effective balance:\n\nAddressing Consensus Layer Challenges\n\nUnder the current limits, the network experiences high withdrawal loads from exceeding the maximum effective balance. Additionally, the large validator sets strain the resources and cause network delays.\n\nConsequently, reducing the number of validators addresses this problem, especially as the network continues to scale.\n\nAllows for Future Upgrades\n\nUpgrades to the Ethereum network, as noted on the roadmap, such as single-slot finality and enshrined proposer-builder separation, rely on a low validator set. The consolidation helps lay the groundwork for the implementation of such upgrades.\n\nCompetitive Solo Staking\n\nWhile large node operators appear to be the key EIP-7251 beneficiaries, solo stakers also have something to gain. Individual stakers can stake flexible amounts of ETH and enjoy the compounding rewards.\n\nReduced Overhead Costs\n\nFor large node operators, the 32 ETH ceiling presents the logistical challenge of running thousands of validators on a single machine. EIP-7251 minimizes the hassle by reducing the number of validators. This also brings the operating cost down, which maximizes the returns.\n\nThere are several reasons against MaxEB:\n\nSlashing Risk\n\nA Proof of Stake (PoS) network such as Ethereum promotes economic security through slashing. Slashing involves partial or full destruction of a validator\u2019s staked assets if they are deemed responsible for actions that threaten the network\u2019s security. MaxEB raises the maximum limit a validator can stake, increasing their slashing risk.\n\nThe Ethereum community is aware of this risk and proposes modification of the slashing penalties. The idea is to introduce non-linear slashing mechanisms that will encourage consolidation.\n\nComplexity\n\nThe current ceiling of 32 ETH per validator makes it simple to consider different consensus aspects. Raising it to 2048 ETH may draw focus away from other critical areas. This may lead to a drop in the network\u2019s security levels.\n\nDecentralization\n\nAs of March 2024, there are over 950,000 validator sets on the Ethereum network. Consolidation under MaxEB will significantly reduce that number. Consequently, there might be an imbalance in committee influence. This goes against the principles of decentralization, as a malicious actor can potentially dominate a committee and execute a 51% attack.\n\nRegulatory Interference\n\nWith auto-compounding validator rewards possible after implementing EIP-7251, regulators may find grounds to argue that ETH is an interest-bearing security.\n\nCurrently, validators are considered service providers who earn rewards for securing the network. Implementing EIP-7251 will lead to more rewards for validators with a higher balance, which may offer regulators grounds to argue that being a validator is the equivalent of a savings account in a traditional bank.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEIP-7251 proposes significantly reducing the number of validators without making major changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are key issues that the community needs to address to ensure its implementation doesn\u2019t affect the network negatively. The community has acknowledged challenges such as slashing concerns and has made proposals to address them. However, others, like regulatory concerns, have yet to be fully explored.\n\nOverall, EIP-7251 presents a pathway to an efficient Ethereum network, provided the community addresses all concerns before implementation."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data shared by the @lookonchain analytics account, two wallets purchased massive amounts of Ethereum on centralized exchanges a few hours ago and then made large purchases over the last three days.\n\nOne of these wallets is suspected to belong to Jihan Wu\u2019s company. In the meantime, while these whales have been grabbing Ethereum to add to their stashes, another massive wallet has made a huge ETH sale on Binance today.\n\nWhales scooping up massive ETH chunks\n\nLookonchain reported that two whales had accumulated big Ethereum chunks. One of them, the source believes, may be Matrixport \u2013 the blockchain company founded by former Bitmain boss Jihan Wu. It was created in 2019 and was his second business venture.\n\nMatrixport\u2019s wallet (presumably) moved 22,251 ETH from crypto exchanges over the past few hours. This amount of Ethereum is evaluated at an impressive $80.06 million. Aside from that, over the last three days, the same wallet has withdrawn 33,925 ETH. This Ethereum lump was worth $122.06 million at the time of the purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLookonchain also provided the address that it believes to belong to Matrixport: 0xacc74cfaa8ad730194c1828cc179c78d5c08200e.\n\nThe second whale that was spotted buying Ethereum was \"0x4359.\" It withdrew 3,092 Ethereum (equal to $11.12 million) from the Binance exchange. Within the last three days, it has purchased 24,044 ETH from Binance in total. While these purchases were being made, Etherum printed three consecutive red candles on an hourly chart, pushing down from $3,609 to $3,543.\n\nAnonymous whale dumps millions in ETH\n\nMeanwhile, as the above-mentioned whales accumulated Ethereum, another big wallet has been selling it. The @spotonchain analytics data account has reported that just recently a large ETH whale transferred 9,000 ETH to Binance to sell it at $3,560 per coin. This amount of Ethereum is valued at approximately $32 million.\n\nThis was the whale's biggest single deposit so far tracked by the aforementioned platform. So far, this whale far holds 29,738 ETH worth roughly $106 million, with an approximate total profit amounting to $68.5 million \u2013 that constitutes 65% growth.\n\nMassive $ETH whale 0x347 deposited 9,000 $ETH ($32M) to #Binance at $3,560 for profits ~ 30 mins ago.\n\n\n\nNotably, this is the whale\u2019s largest $ETH deposit to date.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the whale still holds 29,738 $ETH (~$106M) with an estimated total profit of $68.5M (+65%)!\n\n\n\nFollow\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SdTaPdtLdM \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 11, 2024\n\nAfter soaring above the $3,720 level on Monday, the second largest cryptocurrency retraced 7.80% by Wednesday.

        "content": "VanEck is bracing for a potential rejection.\n\nShare this article\n\nSeveral applications for spot Ethereum ETFs are pending SEC approval. As the decision date approaches, uncertainty grows, with financial and crypto leaders expressing a mix of skepticism and hope.\n\nA recent report from Barron\u2019s suggests an ongoing, frustrating situation for exchange-trade fund (ETF) issuers.\n\nAccording to Barron\u2019s, unlike the open dialogue that paved the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs, the conversation between the issuers and the SEC around Ethereum ETFs seems more one-sided. This lack of engagement foreshadows a rocky road for Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cSome ETF issuers have met with the SEC to talk about their products, but so far, those discussions have largely been one-sided, without the agency giving the companies the critical feedback needed to finalize their products, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d wrote Barron\u2019s. \u201cAt this point in the Bitcoin ETF process, the issuers were already engaged in a robust back-and-forth with agency staff.\u201d\n\nWhile Barron\u2019s is skeptical, JPMorgan believes the question is \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block that a spot Ethereum ETF approval might still occur, but it would take longer than expected.\n\nAccording to him, ETF companies may initiate legal lawsuits against the agency if the SEC doesn\u2019t approve these filings. \u201cIf there is no spot Ethereum ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be a litigation process after May,\u201d said Panigirtzoglou.\n\nPanigirtzoglou suggested that the lawsuit will likely end up in opposition to the SEC, and just like what happened with Grayscale, the SEC would eventually be \u201cforced\u201d to approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nVanEck, one of the spot Ethereum fund issuers, projects an outright rejection of the ETF filings. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said in an interview with CNBC that the applications of VanEck and Ark Invest \u201care kind of the first in line for May\u2026to probably be rejected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,\u201d said van Eck.\n\n\u201c576 to one\u201d\n\nFor many fund managers, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement is a nerve-wracking waiting game. BlackRock, however, might be more accustomed to this process.\n\nBlackRock has a history of 576 ETF approvals with only 1 rejection. This high success rate creates a positive outlook for the asset manager\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nRecently, Ethereum has drawn attention after news that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation by an undisclosed state authority surfaced. Speculations suggest that this scrutiny, possibly from the SEC, aims to classify Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, as a security.\n\nDespite these speculations, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if ETH is classified as a security.\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, suggested BlackRock\u2019s possible application for withdrawal. He noted BlackRock\u2019s history of successful ETF approvals is attributed to a collaborative approach with the SEC, not just forceful tactics.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC asks Blackrock and the other ETH ETF sponsors to withdraw (a common practice), I bet they will,\u201d commented Chervinsky."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have both dipped as investors watch with trepidation for the next round of U.S. inflation data to be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that both BTC and ETH have seen gains compared to last week's not so great start to the month. In the past seven days, the Bitcoin price has gained 4.3% and the Ethereum price has gained 6.3%.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading just below $69,000 after losing 2.3% in the past day. And the Ethereum price\u2014which had been leading Bitcoin in gains earlier this week\u2014has lost 3.4% in the past 24 hours. ETH is currently changing hands for just over $3,500, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBitcoin is now 9 days away from its next halving event, which will see the reward paid to miners cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC on April 20. Although the regularly scheduled anti-inflation measure is usually very bullish for Bitcoin, volatility leading up to it has spiked, with some traders arguing that any post-halving rally will be delayed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes predicted earlier this week that the crypto market will experience a \"raging firesale of crypto assets\" until at least May.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum community was just dealt a round of pessimism from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. Speaking at the Paris Blockchain Week crypto event this week, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said he's not confident there'll be much progress made this year.\n\n\"We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the U.S., and we and [Ark Invest CEO] Cathie Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,\" he told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the event.\n\nA new entrant to the U.S. Bitcoin ETF space, CoinShares, shared a similar view. In March, CoinShares exercised its option to acquire the Valkyrie's ETF business\u2014including its Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund which trades on Nasdaq under the BRRR ticker.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti, also speaking to CNBC at the Paris event, shared his skepticism about gaining SEC approval for a proof-of-stake coin like Ethereum. \"I don\u2019t see anything being approved this side of the year,\" he said.\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves."

        "title": "What Are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) in Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "When you create a new account in your Ethereum wallet, you are setting up an Externally Owned Account (EOA).\n\nEthereum has been at the forefront of decentralized applications and smart contract development. At the heart of user participation on the network lies a fundamental concept: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which are required to initiate any transaction. These accounts allow Ethereum users to send, receive, and manage their digital assets.\n\nKeep reading to learn what EOAs are and how they work\n\nWhat Are Externally Owned Accounts in Ethereum?\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are a type of Ethereum account controlled by users rather than code, as is the case with smart contract accounts. EOAs operate independently but can interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. They are also essential for initiating any transactions on the network.\n\nEOAs are controlled by an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key, a cryptographic method for signing and verifying digital transactions. This process generates a private and corresponding public key, providing transaction security and authentication.\n\nEOAs have various purposes, such as sending and receiving transactions, managing ETH balances, and interacting with smart contracts.\n\nUsers interact with their EOAs and the Ethereum blockchain through wallets that allow them to manage the account\u2019s private keys. The underlying technology for EOAs functions similarly across different wallet types.\n\nSo when you create a new account in an Ethereum wallet, like MetaMask, you create an EOA.\n\nHow Do Ethereum EOA Accounts Work?\n\nEOAs can initiate transactions, send and receive ETH or Ethereum-based tokens (such as ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens), and interact with smart contracts. These accounts are commonly owned by average Ethereum users and interact with the blockchain through crypto wallets.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts have unique private keys, granting control over transaction signing. When users initiate a transaction or deploy a smart contract, they use their private key to sign the transaction, verifying their identity and authorizing the action.\n\nThe private key is then used to generate a corresponding public key that creates the account\u2019s Ethereum address.\n\nOnce verified, the transaction is made available on the Ethereum network, where it is validated and included in a block through the consensus mechanism. The transaction is now immutable and part of the blockchain\u2019s permanent and transparent record.\n\nEOAs are represented on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with an empty code string because they don\u2019t store smart contract data. Still, they hold balance information and transaction counts, which require storage on the blockchain.\n\nCreating an EOA itself incurs no direct blockchain transaction fee, but initiating transactions from it does attract gas fees. The network only recognizes an EOA\u2019s existence after its first transaction, and all transactions, including this first one, attract gas fees.\n\nEOA vs. Smart Contract Accounts: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nEOA accounts are user-controlled Ethereum accounts that require manual inputs for each action. On the other hand, smart contract accounts operate autonomously, executing code based on predefined rules within the blockchain.\n\nHere are more differences between EOA and smart contract accounts on Ethereum.\n\nCriteria EOAs Smart contract accounts Control EOAs are managed by private keys. Smart contract accounts are based on rules encoded within the blockchain. Creation EOAs are created through wallet interfaces, which generate a private key and a corresponding seed phrase applicable to both software and hardware wallets. A smart contract account is initiated when the associated smart contract deploys on-chain, incurring fees. Functionality EOAs are tools for transferring tokens and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum mainnet. Smart contract accounts incorporate programmable logic and advanced features for Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Gas fees EOAs need gas fees for mainnet transactions. Developers can design smart contracts to optimize gas usage, potentially reducing overall gas fees. Security EOAs rely primarily on user responsibility for security. Smart contract accounts allow users to combine multiple security layers, including authentication mechanisms and smart contract design best practices. Account Recovery EOAs don\u2019t support traditional account recovery methods due to the nature of blockchain technology. Account recovery is only possible in smart contract accounts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of EOA Accounts\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are the foundation of user activity on the Ethereum blockchain and offer several benefits. However, they also have limitations.\n\nPros\n\nFull User Control: EOAs give users complete control over the account and its funds. Only the individual with the corresponding private key can manage the account and execute transactions.\n\nVersatile Transaction Initiation: EOAs have the flexibility to initiate any transaction on the Ethereum network, enabling users to interact with various decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nCons\n\nPrivate Key Dependency: EOAs rely heavily on the users\u2019 secure private key management. A lost or compromised private key could lead to the manipulation or loss of funds in an account.\n\nNative Token Dependency on Gas: Requiring users to maintain a balance of native tokens in their EOAs to cover gas fees can bring complexity and additional management tasks.\n\nFinal Take\n\nExternally Owned Accounts are used for standard transactions such as sending and receiving digital assets and managing ETH. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, EOAs remain a foundational element that allows users to navigate various decentralized processes within the Ethereum ecosystem."

Thus, after yesterday's dump, which liquidated tens of millions of dollars worth of positions in just an hour, the price of Ethereum fell by 3.1% at one point, reaching $3,411.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, however, there was a rebound, and a little more than 20 hours later, ETH is trading at $3,591, showing a 5.3% gain from yesterday's bottom.\n\nAmid these dramatic price swings, a flurry of activity from crypto whales, the most prominent players on the market, has caught the attention of analysts. Thus, Spot On Chain reported a massive deposit of 9,000 ETH, worth $32 million, by a whale known as \"0x347\" on Binance, marking the largest ETH deposit by the entity to date.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum sank lower, each dropping more than 2% immediately after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the Consumer Price Index increased 0.4% in March.\n\nThat means inflation last month was virtually unchanged from February and is still at 3.5%, according to the new BLS data.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price has slipped to below $68,000 and the Ethereum price is threatening to go lower than $3,400. Both assets\u2014easily the two largest cryptocurrencies\u2014account for roughly 65% of the $2.7 trillion global market capitalization for digital assets.\n\nHigh inflation rates are bad news for crypto markets\u2014and stocks, for that matter\u2014because as long as inflation remains high, it is unlikely that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower federal interest rates. The longer interest rates remain high, the more it strengthens the case for traditional safe havens like treasury bonds over crypto assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe small bit of good news is that this morning's report isn't entirely unexpected, which should reduce volatility.\n\nAhead of this morning's announcement, analysts forecast that March data would show inflation had risen 3.4% compared to the same time last year. And the core CPI inflation rate, which leaves out volatile food and energy prices, was expected to drop from 3.8% to 3.7% over the same period.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said at a Stanford University event that he's confident the Fed won't raise rates in the near term. But he added that there's also no rush to reduce rates, either.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say whether recent inflation readings are more than just a bump,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released an update to its employment data last week, showing that payrolls had risen in March and the unemployment rate was relatively unchanged at 3.8%. The news was not well received in crypto markets, which slumped last week."

        "title": "NFTs and the Environment: What You Need to Know - Investopedia",
        "content": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ordinals are assets that are tokenized using a blockchain. Because blockchains use energy, NFTs can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change through their production, exchange, and storage.\n\nLearn more about NFTs and ordinals, their environmental impacts, and steps users can take to be more aware.\n\nKey Takeaways Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may contribute to wasteful energy use and carbon output, depending on how they are produced.\n\nEthereum is the leading blockchain used to mint NFTs. It transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on Sept. 15, 2022. The transition, called The Merge, caused a significant reduction in NFT energy use.\n\n\n\nBlockchain developers and communities are working to find ways to lessen or eliminate the environmental impact NFTs have.\n\nUsers can lower their impact by choosing blockchains with less energy-intensive requirements.\n\n\n\nHow NFTs Impact the Environment\n\nNFTs are generally built on Ethereum or blockchains similar to it. Ordinals are similar to NFTs but created on the Bitcoin blockchain or blockchains like it.\n\nDepending on the programming and design of the blockchain on which these NFTs and ordinals reside, these transactions can consume significant amounts of energy.\n\n\n\nThis article uses \"NFT\" to refer to NFTs and ordinals for brevity.\n\nEnergy consumption occurs when an NFT is minted, bought, sold, and stored. Here's a look at each of these stages of the NFT lifecycle:\n\nNFT is minted : The NFT creator uploads an image or other digital asset to a blockchain (including its metadata), which tokenizes and stores the NFT's information on the blockchain. Tokenization is the process of generating a public key and a private key to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The NFT is minted through this process.\n\n: The NFT creator uploads an image or other digital asset to a blockchain (including its metadata), which tokenizes and stores the NFT's information on the blockchain. Tokenization is the process of generating a public key and a private key to access a cryptocurrency wallet. The NFT is minted through this process. NFT is listed : Once the NFT is minted on a blockchain, the creator can list it for viewing on an NFT marketplace at a set or auction price.\n\n: Once the NFT is minted on a blockchain, the creator can list it for viewing on an NFT marketplace at a set or auction price. NFT is sold/purchased : When the NFT is purchased, a blockchain transaction is initiated. The blockchain network goes to work validating the transaction and transferring ownership of the NFT to the new owner.\n\n: When the NFT is purchased, a blockchain transaction is initiated. The blockchain network goes to work validating the transaction and transferring ownership of the NFT to the new owner. Storage: The asset\u2014a file, image, and so on\u2014is stored off-chain, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS).\n\nMinting an NFT is a separate transaction on a blockchain, as is transferring ownership during a sale. All transactions use energy.\n\nNon-Transactional Energy Use\n\nNFTs also require storage, even if there isn't transaction activity. These tokenized assets are generally digital assets such as documents, images, and videos, all requiring digital space. Blockchains themselves are not equipped to store these assets, so only the tokens (alphanumeric sequences that are the result of hashed data) are stored on the blockchains. The assets are stored elsewhere, such as on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). The IPFS was created as a decentralized and distributed storage system for platforms that need it, like blockchains.\n\nData storage requires energy. As the number of NFTs grows, the overall energy consumption and storage space of NFTs are likely to increase.\n\nElectronic Waste\n\nIn addition to energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste) is an issue. If a blockchain relies on mining, like Bitcoin does, hardware is continuously improved and upgraded.\n\nMining typically uses hardware such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to solve increasingly difficult cryptographic problems. This hardware can quickly become outdated\u2014it's also subject to 24-hour 100% usage, which wears electronic circuits out. Updating and replacing faulty equipment creates tons of e-waste.\n\nE-waste contains hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can leach into the environment if improperly disposed of. Additionally, the processing of e-waste is energy-intensive and can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Hardware that isn't recycled ends up in landfills, releasing toxins into the environment.\n\nRecycling e-waste significantly lowers the energy consumption of manufacturing new electronic products by reducing the mining and processing of new raw materials, particularly precious metals.\n\nImproving the Sustainability of NFTs\n\nGiven the potential environmental impact of NFTs, there is a movement to develop more sustainable blockchain and NFT protocols. Additionally, artists, buyers, and sellers can choose to use NFT platforms and blockchains that use less energy. These would likely include less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms and, to a point, blockchains with hotspots in areas that use renewable energy sources.\n\nTo determine blockchain sustainability, you must inspect where nodes are located and determine the significant energy sources in those areas. For example, the Ethereum network has 2,900 nodes (the most) in the U.S., the energy generation of which is 79% from petroleum, natural gas, and coal. The U.S. also has about 1,600 reachable Bitcoin nodes. It's safe to say that platforms using a blockchain with a significant presence in the U.S. are not as energy efficient as they could be. However, Ethereum uses less energy, so in the U.S. it's a better choice.\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nBlockchain mining and hardware recycling often rely on burning fossil fuels, leaving a significant environmental footprint. Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy, offer eco-friendly alternatives to power these operations.\n\nSolar Energy : Solar panels are installed to capture energy from sunlight, which is then converted into electricity.\n\n: Solar panels are installed to capture energy from sunlight, which is then converted into electricity. Wind Energy : Wind turbines erected in windy areas can generate electricity from the kinetic energy of the wind.\n\n: Wind turbines erected in windy areas can generate electricity from the kinetic energy of the wind. Hydroelectric Energy : Hydroelectric power is taken from water sources, such as rivers or dams.\n\n: Hydroelectric power is taken from water sources, such as rivers or dams.

Biomass Energy: Biomass energy consists of organic materials. Plants, crops, and agricultural waste can be burned to generate heat or converted into biofuels.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms\n\nShifting from Proof-of-Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism for Bitcoin and other mining-based blockchains, to more energy-efficient ones, such as Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, can significantly reduce the environmental impact NFTs have. PoS eliminates the competitive mining and reward process altogether.\n\nPoS consumes significantly less energy than PoW because PoS does not require miners to expend energy in a competition to solve a cryptographic problem. Instead, PoS uses a system called staking, where validators who have staked cryptocurrency\u2014basically locking it from being used\u2014on the network are randomly chosen to verify transactions and propose new blocks.\n\nEthereum is expected to consume about 5.36 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, while Bitcoin is expected to consume about 173.19 terawatt hours annually, more than Poland and Egypt.\n\nSome notable PoS blockchains include:\n\nEthereum : The Ethereum blockchain is used for almost everything from simple token exchanges to NFTs, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and more. The NFT marketplace OpenSea is built on Ethereum.\n\n: The Ethereum blockchain is used for almost everything from simple token exchanges to NFTs, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and more.

Cardano : Hosts some NFT marketplaces like Galaxy of Art.\n\n: Hosts some NFT marketplaces like Galaxy of Art. Tezos: The Tezos blockchain hosts several NFT marketplaces, such as Rarible, which operates an NFT marketplace and supports the artistic creation of NFTs.\n\nWhy Does an NFT Use So Much Energy? Non-fungible tokens use energy because they require a blockchain network to conduct work verifying them as transactions. More transactions require more energy.\n\nAre NFTs Harmful to the Environment? Creating, selling, and buying an NFT require energy and hardware use, which can lead to pollution or e-waste that would not otherwise be necessary if they did not exist.\n\nWhat Is the Carbon Footprint of an NFT? It is hard to determine what one NFT costs regarding carbon generation, but it's safe to say that they add to human activities' total carbon output.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNFTs leave a carbon footprint at every stage of their existence, but conscious choices and prioritizing eco-friendly practices in how they are created, traded, and stored can offset their potential impact on the environment.\n\nCryptocurrency developers can reduce NFT energy consumption by improving or switching to less energy-intensive blockchain consensus mechanisms. NFT minting and hosting platforms can use blockchains that don't require large amounts of energy.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "The Ethereum co-founder Steven Nerayoff against the United States Government - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, once a key advisor of the Ethereum network, has launched a bold legal challenge against the United States government, seeking damages of $9.6 billion for what he claims are unjust criminal extortion charges filed against him in 2019, only to be later withdrawn.\n\nIn what unfolds as a legal thriller narrative, the case brings to light not only a personal battle for justice, but also deeper concerns about justice, the role of government agencies, and the vulnerability of individuals in the face of systemic power.\n\nThe $9.6 billion legal battle between former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff and the United States Government\n\nThe legal team of Nerayoff has put forward the hypothesis that their client has been trapped by the FBI and federal prosecutors in a calculated attempt to force him to disclose information about prominent figures within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThis statement, if proven, not only questions the ethics of investigative practices, but also highlights the precarious intersection between law enforcement and constitutional rights in the world of digital finance.\n\nThe genesis of the cause can be traced back to September 17, 2019, when Nerayoff was arrested in dramatic circumstances by FBI agents. The charges against him were serious, implicating him in criminal extortion.\n\nHowever, the narrative took a significant turn when, in May 2023, the United States government dropped all charges against him. This withdrawal followed a motion by the prosecutors acknowledging the discovery of material exculpatory evidence and admitting their inability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charges in the indictment.\n\nThis dramatic turn of events serves as the backdrop for Nerayoff\u2019s current legal maneuver. Invoking the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), he has signaled his intention to hold the Department of Justice (DOJ) accountable for what he describes as a case based on unfounded and fabricated charges concocted against him.\n\n\n\nThe FTCA serves as a mechanism through which individuals can sue the federal government for the wrongdoing committed by its officials, and Nerayoff\u2019s request is particularly remarkable for its staggering demand of 9.6 billion dollars in damages.\n\nThe importance of chance and its potential ramifications\n\nAdding a level of complexity and seriousness to the case is the engagement of Alan Dershowitz, a renowned civil liberties lawyer, who has joined Nerayoff\u2019s legal team as a consultant on constitutional issues. Dershowitz\u2019s involvement underscores the importance of the case and its potential ramifications on the interpretation and application of constitutional rights in the United States.\n\nAt the center of Nerayoff\u2019s argument is the accusation that his legal troubles were the result of a complex FBI plot aimed at using him as a source of information against others in the cryptocurrency industry. If proven, this claim could expose serious ethical and legal violations in the conduct of federal investigations.\n\nFurthermore, the narrative includes claims that Michael Hlady, a former co-defendant in the extortion charges and a convicted criminal, was placed in Nerayoff\u2019s circle by the FBI as part of their strategy to build a case against him. If proven, these assertions could expose serious ethical and legal violations in the conduct of federal investigations.\n\nThe development of this case will undoubtedly be closely followed, not only for its direct impact on the individuals involved but also for its broader implications.\n\nAt stake are issues of power balance between the state and individuals, the integrity of the legal system, and the protection of civil liberties in a digital age that increasingly blurs the boundaries between private enterprise and public responsibility.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Steven Nerayoff\u2019s legal battle against the United States government transcends his personal claim.\n\nIt stands as a test of the robustness of constitutional protections against government power, particularly in innovative and unexplored sectors such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs this case progresses, it will inevitably spark debates and discussions on the nature of justice, the ethics of law enforcement, and the ever-evolving relationship between technology and the law."

However, the delayed timeline adds an element of uncertainty to Blackrock\u2019s plans.\n\nThe firm has been positioning itself as a leader in the rapidly evolving digital asset space, and a successful Ethereum ETF launch could further cement its position.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s reputation and influence within the traditional finance industry make the outcome of this decision all the more crucial for the crypto ecosystem. Other companies, like Fidelity and VanEck, are also waiting for the SEC to approve their EFT.\n\nGary Gensler\u2019s Pivotal Role in ETH ETF Approval and Possible Industry Reaction\n\nThe decision ultimately lies in SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who has taken a cautious stance on cryptocurrency-related products. Gensler\u2019s approach has ensured that any crypto-linked financial instruments adhere to stringent regulatory standards, prioritizing investor protection.\n\nAs the August 7th deadline for the Blackrock Ethereum ETF looms, all eyes will be on whether Gensler will dare to deny the industry heavyweight\u2019s application.\n\nGensler\u2019s previous comments on the need for greater regulatory oversight in the crypto space suggest that he may be inclined to take a measured approach. He could potentially delay or even reject the Ethereum ETF application if he is not fully satisfied with the investor protection measures in place.\n\nMeanwhile, the delay in Ethereum ETF approvals could have wider implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, is crucial in the overall digital asset ecosystem.\n\nThe launch of an Ethereum ETF has the potential to attract significant institutional investment. This could drive up the price of Ether and, in turn, have a positive ripple effect on the entire crypto market.\n\nIf the SEC ultimately denies the Blackrock Ethereum ETF, it could be a setback for the crypto industry\u2019s efforts to gain mainstream acceptance.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

        "title": "Here is Shiba Inu Price if SHIB Hits Ethereum Market Cap - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see its price skyrocket by more than 24 times if it grows to capture the current market cap of leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH).\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s market cap has seen a drastic decline since the cryptocurrency collapsed from the $0.000045 high on March 5. At this peak price, SHIB\u2019s market cap hit a high of $26.5 billion, putting it among the top 10 assets by valuation and bringing it closer to flipping Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nHowever, SHIB\u2019s market cap has dropped to the current figure of $16.7 billion, representing a 37% drop from the recent high. Consequently, Shiba Inu has ceded its position within the top 10, descending to the 12th position as both Toncoin (TON) and Avalanche (AVAX) have surpassed it.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite the prevailing turbulence, Shiba Inu enthusiasts expect SHIB to eventually recover, with projections of a possible push above Dogecoin. Such a scenario would result in mind-blowing price gains for Shiba Inu.\n\nShiba Inu Price if It Hits Ethereum Market Cap\n\nAmid these sentiments, we assessed how much the price of Shiba Inu would be if it soared to hit the market cap of the king altcoin, Ethereum. ETH has solidified its spot as the largest altcoin in the market, boasting a market capitalization of $407.58 billion.\n\nNotably, Ethereum accounts for 15.8% of the global cryptocurrency market cap of $2.58 trillion. At the current valuation, Ethereum\u2019s price currently sits at $3,388. We leveraged a data analytics tool to evaluate how much Shiba Inu\u2019s price would be if it equaled ETH\u2019s market cap.\n\nThe data indicates that Shiba Inu\u2019s valuation is about 0.04x under Ethereum\u2019s, emphasizing the massive gap between both assets. If SHIB captures Ethereum\u2019s market cap, its price will skyrocket by as much as 24.36x to reach $0.0006898, representing a new ATH.\n\nInterestingly, some analytical platforms have projected timelines for Shiba Inu to reach prices around this region. The Crypto Basic revealed in February that Changelly analysts expect SHIB to reach $0.000712 by 2030. At this price, Shiba Inu\u2019s market cap would soar to $419.5 billion, above Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSHIB\u2019s Current Position\n\nNotably, SHIB\u2019s all-time high market cap was $43 billion, attained on Oct. 28, 2021, when Shiba Inu soared to its ATH price of $0.00008616, according to CoinGecko data. Shiba Inu would need to rally by another 206% to reclaim this all-time high price and slip into a price discovery phase.\n\nThe crypto market is already on a recovery path following the recent turmoil, with prices witnessing gradual growth over the last two days. Shiba Inu has leveraged this campaign to push toward reclaiming the $0.000028, $0.000029 and $0.000030 levels.\n\nAmid a 2.6% rise over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu currently trades for $0.00002810. SHIB has reclaimed $0.000028, but its position above this price level remains delicate. It attempted to push above $0.000029 earlier but faced stern opposition."

        "content": "Inflation has increased by 3.5%.\n\nEthereum has seen over 2% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum [ETH] experienced a positive response following the release of the latest CPI report. This report garnered significant attention and discussions among traders, with many expressing a greater inclination towards crypto assets in light of the findings.\n\nCPI shows 3.5% inflation increase\n\nThe CPI for March surpassed expectations, rising by 0.4% compared to the anticipated 0.3% and February\u2019s 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI increased by 3.5%, slightly higher than the expected 3.4% and February\u2019s 3.2%.\n\nYear-over-year core CPI saw a slight uptick to 3.8%, slightly surpassing the expected 3.7% and remaining unchanged from February\u2019s figure. This data suggests that a rate cut is unlikely soon.\n\nAccording to Santiment data, this month\u2019s CPI report generated significant attention, evidenced by the highest number of mentions in social discussions. The social volume spiked to over 257, with social dominance reaching around 1.58%.\n\nAt the time of this writing, social volume had decreased to 49, while social dominance stood at 1.05%. The implications of this report have led to increased interest in crypto assets like Ethereum.\n\nBuy calls put Ethereum in a favorable position\n\nThe CPI report wasn\u2019t the sole topic driving increased interaction; discussions around buy and sell calls also saw heightened engagement. According to Santiment data, on 10th April, the social volume for buy calls reached 814, with a social dominance of 4.97%.\n\nConversely, the social volume for sell calls was 533, with a social dominance of 3.25%.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the buy social volume had decreased to 210, while the sell social volume was 144. Additionally, the buy social dominance stood at 4.48%, while the sell dominance was 3.07%.\n\nThese figures indicate a stronger inclination towards buying among traders, a sentiment reflected in Ethereum outflows.\n\nEthereum sees more exchange outflow\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum\u2019s exchange netflow reveals that the increase in buy calls following the CPI report is mirrored in its exchange flow. Data showed that outflow dominated ETH exchange flow, with over 15,800 ETH leaving various exchanges on 10th April.\n\nAs of this writing, outflow continued to dominate, with over 800 ETH already withdrawn from exchanges. This suggests heightened activity in ETH buying and selling post-CPI report.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum continues to climb post-CPI\n\nThe daily timeframe chart showed that Ethereum closed with a gain on 10th April, suggesting that the CPI report did not have a negative effect.\n\nAnalysis of the chart revealed that ETH closed with over a 1% increase, trading at around $3,400. As of the latest data, the increase has persisted, with ETH trading at around $3,580, reflecting a further over 1% increase."

        "content": "In a recent analysis by renowned trader Alan Santana, Ethereum (ETH) is forecast to experience a 150% surge. The analysis predicts ETH to potentially reach an all-time high of $7,428.\n\nDespite the current market downturn, with ETH trading at $3,517.35, down 3.23% over the past 24 hours, Santana remains extremely bullish on the ETH/BTC trading pair.\n\nSource: Alan Santana (TradingView chart)\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Weekly Prediction: Can DOGE Surge 50% To Hit $0.3?\n\nThe provided technical analysis indicates that Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth potential is still intact. The chart indicates that if the support level, represented by the light orange line, holds, the ETH/BTC pair is expected to move higher.\n\nThis support level is crucial for maintaining the bullish momentum and setting the stage for the anticipated 150% surge.\n\nSantana emphasizes the importance of patience in this market, stating, \u201cPatience is key. We continue 100% bullish on ETHBTC. We keep the same market bias.\u201d\n\nEthereum forecasted to hit a new all-time high\n\nDespite the recent market volatility, with Ethereum\u2019s 24-hour trading volume at $15,889,812,762 and its price fluctuating between a low of $3,455.11 and a high of $3,643.03, Santana\u2019s analysis suggests that ETH is poised for a significant breakout. The trader\u2019s assertion of a 150% surge indicates that Ethereum could potentially outperform Bitcoin in the coming months.\n\nEthereum currently has a market cap of $422,264,036,523. The projected surge to $7,428 would represent a significant milestone for ETH.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: 3 Coins You Should Buy For The Bull Run\n\nThe analysis and projection come at a time when speculation of an ETH ETF approval is hovering around. With the expectation that Ethereum ETFs could soon hit the market, investors expect a notable surge for the coin. However, it is quite uncertain as to when the SEC could approve an ETH ETF."

        "content": "With Bitcoin halving just around the corner, the crypto investors may seek a change in strategy and restock their portfolio with better investments. Amid such development, the memecoin sectors have been crucial elements in a diverse portfolio offering some of the fast-growing assets to investors.\n\nThe meme cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Grok (GROK), MAGA, and Floki (FLOKI) have shown notable recovery since the onset of 2024, capturing the investor\u2019s attention looking for high-reward opportunities.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEach token, with its distinct charm and growing popularity, suggests a promising avenue for turning a modest investment into substantial earnings. Amid the dynamic crypto market, these assets embody the fusion of Internet culture and investment potential.\n\n1. Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB), influenced by a viral meme, has seen remarkable growth in the decentralized finance world. Its value and popularity have soared, and a passionate community supports it.\n\nOver the last month, SHIB\u2019s price trajectory has been upward, surpassing various resistance levels, culminating in a 31% increase. This trend suggests a strong bullish sentiment in the market. Despite a short phase of horizontal trading with slight retractions, SHIB remains an attractive investment prospect.\n\nCurrently, the price of Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002767, with a recent rise of 0.72% in the past 24 hours. This growth positions SHIB as a serious competitor to Dogecoin, branding it as one of the top four Ethereum-based meme coins under $1 that could turn a $10 investment into $1000 within a week.\n\n2. \u200b\u200bGrok (GROK)\n\n\u200b\u200bGrok (GROK) has quickly become a standout among meme coins. It draws its inspiration from Elon Musk\u2019s X company\u2019s Grok AI project. The coin\u2019s affiliation with such a notable personality has significantly boosted its visibility. This visibility has propelled it to a leading position within the niche of AI-themed meme cryptocurrencies.\n\nPresently, Grok is trading at $0.01117. It has achieved a trading volume of $70 million in the past 24 hours. The coin\u2019s price has surged by more than 2% in just one day. This surge places it among the top four sub-dollar Ethereum-based meme coins. Such performance has demonstrated the potential to turn an investment of $10 into $1000 within a week.\n\n3. Wiener AI\n\nWienerAI is the first ever construct blending a Wiener, a dog, and artificial intelligence, making it the most powerful cybernetic entity in the crypto universe. WienerAI presents an innovative AI token that initiates a fresh worldwide move. This new blend goes beyond typical digital assets by offering unmatched power as a cybernetic character. With goals set on reaching the top of the cryptocurrency rankings, WienerAI introduces unique staking rewards and creates a resilient Sausage Army ready to take over the decentralized space.\n\nThe main goal of WienerAI is to change how AI blends with companionship, aiming for a future filled with kindness and laughter, led by the Sausage Army. By combining AI with blockchain technology, WienerAI works on the Ethereum Network. Leveraging its strong base for growth and development, the $WAI token, an ERC20 asset, symbolizes constant progress and includes modular technology to stay a leader in AI innovation.\n\n4. Maga (MAGA)\n\nMaga (MAGA), a cryptocurrency associated with the MAGA movement, currently trades at $6.14. Its trading activity over the past day reached $3.2 million. The digital asset has seen an increase of 7.26% within the last 24 hours. Ranking at number 273 on CoinMarketCap, its market capitalization stands at $258 million. This update highlights Maga\u2019s recent performance in the crypto market.\n\n5. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki (FLOKI) has transcended its meme origins to become a key player in the Web3 arena. Now incorporating aspects of the Metaverse, DeFi, and NFTs, it proudly bears the moniker \u201cThe People\u2019s Crypto.\u201d By weaving meme charm with real-world functionality, Floki stands out. Due to its presence on the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum networks, this token is available as both a BEP-20 and ERC-20.\n\nAs of the latest, Floki price is $0.0001957, marking a notable rise in the past day. However, it\u2019s not all upward trends; its value dropped by over 30% in the past month.\n\nThis volatility positions it as one of the top four sub-dollar Ethereum-based meme coins to watch, with the potential to turn a modest $10 investment into $1000 within just a week. With a market capitalization of $1.86 billion, Floki ranks 49th on the CoinMarketCap leaderboard.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the digital currency market evolves, SHIB, GROK, MAGA, and FLOKI stand out for their rapid ascension and potential to deliver substantial returns. Their unique positioning and investor backing highlight them as prime candidates for those looking to leverage the meme coin craze for significant financial gain.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination. No positive signs/intel anywhere you look. Personally hope they do approve it but it just ain\u2019t looking good. https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 25, 2024\n\nAdditionally, VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck expressed anticipation of a potential rejection of their Ethereum ETF application, citing prolonged regulatory reviews and lack of clarity from the SEC.\n\nSpot ETH ETF Gains Regulatory Interest Overseas\n\nAmidst the uncertainty surrounding the US SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum ETFs, reports suggest a contrasting regulatory environment in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Hong Kong regulators may soon approve exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a potential shift in global regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrency investment products.\n\nIf approved, these ETFs could offer investors new avenues for exposure to the digital asset market. Several firms are poised to launch ETFs pending regulatory clearance from the Securities and Futures Commission.\n\nAmong the prospective issuers awaiting approval are international arms of Chinese asset manager Harvest Fund Management Co. and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital.\n\nUpon receiving regulatory approval, these firms have indicated their intent to launch ETFs investing in BTC and ETH, highlighting the growing demand for cryptocurrency investment products in global markets.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Stream Trading Raises $1.5 Million Amidst Crypto Surge - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Stream Finance, a newcomer to the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s crypto derivatives space, successfully secured $1.5 million during its seed funding round. The round, led by Polychain with participation from angel investors, values Stream Finance at $20 million.\n\nThis financial boost has elevated the company\u2019s market valuation to an impressive $20 million. At the heart of Stream Trading\u2019s operation is its innovative protocol, which offers depositors the opportunity to engage in high-yield rate arbitrage trades.\n\nFor this service, the company imposes a fee of 10% or more, underscoring its revenue-generating mechanism.\n\nRapid Growth Amidst a Crypto Bull Market\n\nThe founding duo, Diogenes Casares and Solal Afota, swiftly assembled a talented team to leverage the ongoing crypto bull market. Their strategic moves are bearing fruit, as trading platforms across the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape are witnessing substantial gains.\n\nStream Trading, having just concluded its beta testing phase, has already amassed $5 million in total value locked, positioning it on the brink of profitability.\n\nMoreover, Casares has articulated a visionary trajectory for Stream Trading, aspiring to evolve into a leading decentralized perpetuals exchange. This ambition sets it on a competitive path against established names like dYdX within the nascent yet dynamic DeFi derivatives sector.\n\nDespite its nascent stage, Casares claims Stream is nearing profitability. Their protocol offers depositors access to high-yield rate arbitrage trades, with fees exceeding 10%. Stream\u2019s long-term vision is to become a decentralized perpetuals exchange, rivalling the likes of dYdX in the young, five-year-old DeFi derivatives market.\n\nCasares believes current protocols prioritize low fees over improving funding rates, the interest paid by traders speculating on asset prices. \u201cOur focus is on the funding rate side, not the swap fees,\u201d he stated.\n\nStream Trading differentiates itself by focusing on optimizing funding rates rather than merely reducing swap fees, a strategic pivot from the conventional approach adopted by most protocols.\n\nStream Trading\u2019s successful funding round highlights the innovative approaches being adopted by new entrants to carve out their niche."

        "title": "Ethereum's (ETH) $4,000 Is New Goal, Shiba Inu (SHIB) to Explode in Symmetrical Triangle, Cardano (ADA) on Verge of Reversal - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, ETH is carving out what appears to be an ascending channel, a structure that could signal a steady climb toward $4,000.\n\nThe ascending channel is outlined by two upward sloping parallel lines on the chart. This pattern captures the swings of the price between higher highs and higher lows, showcasing a gradual but consistent upward trend.\n\nFor Ethereum, the lower line of the channel seems to be providing a stepping stone from which the price bounces back up, and the upper line is where the price peaks before retreating slightly.\n\nA key level to watch is the recent resistance Ethereum has encountered near the $3,500 level. A decisive push past this point could pave the way for a test of higher resistances, ultimately aiming for the channel's upper boundary and beyond to $4,000. Currently, the chart shows Ethereum hovering around $3,500, which aligns with the channel's midpoint \u2014 a crucial area for bulls to defend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the support side, the $3,072 mark stands as the channel's lower boundary. As long as the price remains within the confines of the channel, optimism remains. A dip below, however, could signal a need to reassess the bullish scenario.\n\nLooking ahead, the main goal for Ethereum is to maintain its momentum within this ascending channel. A breakout above could confirm the bulls' strength, leading to a significant rally. On the flip side, a breakdown could shift market sentiment.\n\nShiba Inu's positive dynamic\n\nShiba Inu is showing the possibility of a volatility explosion as the asset is on the verge of reaching the tip of the aforementioned formation. This pattern is formed when the price of an asset consolidates within converging support and resistance lines, hinting that a significant price move could be on the horizon \u2014 either a sharp rise or a decline.\n\nThe pattern's apex draws nearer, suggesting that a big move is imminent. Symmetrical triangles are notorious for their unpredictability in terms of direction. The breakout could lead to a surge in price if it moves upward or a fall if it breaks down.\n\nCurrently, SHIB is trading within a tight range, and the specific price to watch is the triangle's upper boundary, around $0.00002776. A consistent move above this level could signal a breakout to the upside, with the next resistance possibly forming near the $0.00002987 mark. Conversely, if SHIB breaks below the triangle's lower support at $0.00002515, it may experience a downturn, with the next level of significant support at $0.00002236.\n\nThe future of SHIB, within this symmetrical triangle, remains unclear, and so does the direction of the token and its future. SHIB might leverage this pattern for a bullish breakout if the market remains bullish.\n\nCardano on reversal point\n\nCardano's indicators suggest an upcoming reversal. The asset has reached a crucial price level that, in the past, has served as a beginning point of a bullish reversal.\n\nADA is hovering around the $0.57 mark, a significant level that has historically acted as a pivot point. This price acted as a strong support in previous trading sessions, hinting at the potential for a bounce back. The critical resistance to overcome for a solid reversal stands at $0.62 which, if broken, could see ADA rally toward the next resistance point at $0.65.\n\nIf ADA fails to maintain this support level, the next significant floor is expected near the $0.5266 mark, where buyers may reemerge to bolster the price. This zone remains crucial for the bulls to defend to prevent further declines that could dampen the short-term outlook for ADA.\n\nA successful rebound from the current support could validate Cardano's readiness to climb. An upswing backed by increased trading volumes and positive market sentiment could carry ADA to retest its recent peaks and potentially establish new ones."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nEthereum is making headlines in the second week of April 2024, accelerating past $3,700 on April 9. In the past seven days, the crypto has seen a 6.60 percent rise.\n\n\n\nAs of April 10, ETH trades around $3,500.\n\n\n\nNotably, the hikes noticed recently outpaced Bitcoin in growth percentages, even as the larger point remains that the two are by no means comparable and a smaller stride for Bitcoin holds equal, if not more, impact as compared to a larger step for Ethereum and other altcoins. In relevant news, Bitcoin has gained 4.46 percent in the past seven days.\n\n\n\nWhy the recent highs for Ethereum? The many factors include strong and optimistic market activities; further, the bullish momentum and rising volumes across the crypto markets have spurred on a higher degree of social activities, giving Ethereum its most recent boost.\n\n\n\nThere is also the matter of ETH derivatives. The Ethereum derivatives markets are overall signifying continued bullish trajectory for ETH in the rest of April. Notably, the upcoming significant market events include the fourth ever Bitcoin halving in just 9 days now, which has the potential to inject a great deal of crypto\u2019s infamous volatility across all assets. However, it seems the traders in the aforementioned derivates markets remain positive.\n\n\n\nThere is one remaining factor that may be fueling the ETH proponents in particular- the potential for one or more spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. Similar instruments for Bitcoin from renowned US-based financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have left their mark in the market already, pulling in institutional investors and boosting Bitcoin\u2019s price to a $70,000 support.\n\n\n\n10 of the major US spot Bitcoin ETFs cumulatively hold about 859,280 bitcoins as of April 9, 2024.\n\n\n\nWhile many expect Ethereum ETFs to have a similar impact on the mainstream journey of the crypto industry, some analysts remain skeptical of the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) actually giving such investment instruments a go ahead, especially as there\u2019s an ongoing probe on whether Ethereum is to be classified as a commodity or not.\n\n\n\nHowever, with consistent protocol updates, Ethereum is planning ahead, and the user excitement surrounding it is not likely to dim, regardless of the presence of a spot ETH ETF in the heart of global finance.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "Berlin, Germany, April 11th, 2024, Chainwire\n\nNektar Network - the multilayered Re-staking network is designed to optimize 's security model while scaling distributed solutions, paving the way for more decentralized infrastructure.\n\nThe team behind Diva Staking unveils the Nektar Network, a pioneering restaking ecosystem poised to redefine the Ethereum trust model and extend its utility across distributed systems. The Nektar Network launches with a vision to democratize Ethereum\u2019s validation process while addressing the challenges of centralization and resilience.\n\nPopularized by EigenLayer, already with $14 billion in re-staked ETH, Re-staking implies repurposing a staked asset to secure additional tasks or duties by the validators using such staked assets as collateral. Users can opt into Nektar to augment their staking activities, earning additional rewards from AVSs.\n\nNektar Network tackles critical challenges within the blockchain space by empowering different agents. Nektar facilitates the seamless establishment of PoS-based distributed systems, enhancing trust and security for applications utilizing its services.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving into a more sophisticated and developed landscape. There are now specialized actors vital for a smooth bootstrapping of the network. We are confident that with their help, the Nektar Community will grow at lightning speed to become one of the most relevant actors within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNektar Network aims to be a response to the growing problem of centralization in the Ethereum ecosystem. While there are major concerns about a limited number of actors controlling the validation layer, at a Re-staking level the ecosystem was in need of viable alternatives to diversify the growing interest in Re-staking. Nektar Network intends to position itself as the most resilient alternative within this vital component of Ethereum\u2019s scaling.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of Distributed Validation Technology (DVT) within Nektar enhances Ethereum's resilience, presenting a robust infrastructure for developers, operators, and validators to engage with the Ethereum network more securely and efficiently.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has reached a critical juncture. On one hand, liquid staking has democratized access to Ethereum validation. On the other, it has created a centralization problem where a handful of entities could, in theory, collude to control the network. Continuing down this path would contradict one of Ethereum\u2019s core tenets and send the wrong message to stakeholders. Nektar provides a restaking network as decentralized as possible, powered by DVT.\n\nUsers can find more information here.\n\nMedia inquiries\n\nRedhill (on behalf of Nektar Network)\n\nTien Ma\n\ntien@redhill.world\n\nAbout Nektar Network\n\nNektar Network is a multilayered restaking network built on top of Ethereum. It consists of components that together form a comprehensive incentives system designed to democratize access to Ethereum's trust model.\n\nFor more information about Nektar Network, users can visit our website or follow on Farcaster and X.\n\nAbout Diva Staking\n\nFounded in 2023, Diva Staking is the company behind Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). It aims to increase the decentralization of Ethereum staking through its proprietary DVT solution that balances the interests of stakers and operators. In January 2023, Diva Staking raised $3.5 million in seed funding from A&T Capital, OKX Ventures, Alphemy Capital, and Metaweb Ventures, among others.\n\nContactTien MaRedhill GmbHtien@redhill.asia\n\nThis article was originally published on Chainwire"

        "content": "Wed 10 Apr 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe crypto and financial industries are hopeful that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will rule in favor of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, some experts believe their hope may be in vain, as the chances of such a prospect coming to fruition seem to be dwindling. Here\u2019s why they are so pessimistic.\n\nThe Ambiguity of Ethereum\u2019s Crypto Status as a Key Obstacle\n\nWhile Bitcoin spot ETFs have gained some popularity, expectations for approval of a spot Ethereum ETF are facing a harsh reality. The prospects for a Spot Ethereum ETF seem to be growing dimmer.\n\nDuring the Paris Blockchain Week conference, Jan van Eck, CEO of asset manager VanEck, shared his pessimism about this possibility. He mentions the uncertainty surrounding the application submitted by the company he leads. But that is not the main reason for his doubts.\n\nThe head of Van Eck believes that unlike bitcoin (BTC), which is widely regarded as a decentralized commodity, the regulatory classification of ether (ETH) remains ambiguous. It is this lack of clarity that complicates the approval process for the highly anticipated Ethereum ETF.\n\nConsequently, he no longer rules out the possibility that the SEC may outright reject his company\u2019s Ethereum ETF application. Furthermore, an asset manager like Ark Invest, headed by Cathy Wood, whose application is expected to be reviewed in May, could also face the same fate.\n\nEthereum ETF Hopes Fade as SEC's Crypto Crackdown Dashes Approval Expectationshttps://t.co/wkMy2snmKh \u2014 John Morgan (@johnmorganFL) April 9, 2024\n\nLittle Enthusiasm Now for an Ethereum ETF\n\nJan van Eck\u2019s view is just an echo of an opinion that is increasingly spreading among crypto and financial industry players. Indeed, he is not the only one expressing doubts about the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nJean-Marie Mognetti, CEO of CoinShares, is of the same opinion. He has expressed his skepticism about obtaining the SEC\u2019s green light, contrary to what happened with Bitcoin in January. However, he does not outright dismiss this possibility.\n\nHe implied that approval might not materialize until the end of the year, even though he acknowledges concerns about Ethereum\u2019s consensus model, which relies on stakers rather than miners.\n\nIn short, the excitement around the emergence of a spot Ethereum ETF has given way to the industry players\u2019 doubts within a backdrop of regulatory hurdles. Knowing that the road to the approval of this instrument might prove to be tough and prolonged, investors and crypto players must arm themselves with patience while waiting for regulators\u2019 clarifications.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum's recent price movement has shown that it's still significantly correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nWhales are accumulating Ethereum, with the aim to participate in the ETH restaking boom.\n\nThe SEC's recent Wells notice to decentralized exchange Uniswap could affect Ethereum, considering it is home to a large portion of DeFi.\n\nEthereum (ETH) showed signs of recovering its bullish momentum on Thursday, briefly rising to $3,618 as whales entered a buying spree. Despite the movement from whales, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wells notice to Uniswap could affect Ethereum in the long run.\n\nRead more: Ethereum extends correction as Van Eck CEO dampens chances of spot ETH ETF approval\n\nDaily digest market movers: Whales accumulation, Bitcoin correlation, Wells notice\n\nEthereum joined a host of other altcoins in trading in the green on Thursday after two days of sustaining a bearish move. Here are your key market movers for the largest smart contract blockchain:\n\nAfter ETH's slight increase on Thursday, large ETH whale Ox347 deposited 9000 ETH tokens to Binance at $3,560 in a bid to book profits, according to onchain insights from Spot On Chain. Although this is the whale's largest ETH deposit to date, its address still holds 29,738 ETH worth a whopping $106 million with an estimated profit of $68.5 million.\n\n\n\nDespite the profit-taking from whale Ox347, onchain data from Lookonchain indicates that some other whales are taking opposite actions:\n\n\n\nWhale 0x4359, who had earlier bought 10,309 ETH ($35.82 million) at the bottom of the price drop on Wednesday, withdrew another 3,092 ETH ($11.12 million) from Binance on Thursday. As a result, his total ETH withdrawals from Binance in the past three days have reached 24,044 ETH ($86.5 million).\n\n\n\nAnother whale, 0xACc7, withdrew 22,251 ETH ($80.06 million) from exchanges on Thursday, taking their total exchange withdrawals in the past three days to 33,925 ETH ($122.06 million).\n\n\n\nSome crypto community members have speculated that the whales' recent move may be to participate in the restaking boom that's heating up in DeFi, especially with the Mainnet launch of EigenLayer. Data from Lookonchain confirms this as whales/institutions withdrew ETH from Binance and staked it into Pendle and Bedrock.\n\nWhile the recent price increase may have several factors layered in, it shows Ethereum still maintains a significant correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Like several other large-cap altcoins, Ethereum's price movement has largely mimicked Bitcoin's since the beginning of the year. Hence, the Bitcoin halving \u2013 less than eight days away \u2013 could prove critical in determining ETH's price movement in the coming days.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a Wells notice to Ethereum's largest decentralized exchange, Uniswap. The Wells notice, a formal document indicating the SEC's intention to take legal action against an individual or firm, was issued based on claims that Uniswap operated as an unregistered securities broker and exchange.\n\n\n\nIf the SEC succeeds in taking legal action against Uniswap, it could significantly affect the broader DeFi landscape. This would have telling effects on Ethereum, the underlying home to roughly 80% of DeFi solutions. Earlier in March, the SEC had issued subpoenas to three firms that had dealings with the Ethereum Foundation. Many crypto community members have stated that the SEC aims to classify Ethereum as a security.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum could be set for growth as Vitalik Butein shares update on its future\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue sideways movement\n\nETH's price has been following a sideways pattern after recovering from the one-week correction that followed the high of $4,094 on March 11. While traders expected a rally back to the $4,094 high when ETH tagged the key resistance of $3,730 on Monday, the price retraced. The continued sideways move indicates traders are exercising caution and are indecisive on whether to go long or short.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nRead more: Ethereum's price recovery looks imminent as ETF approval sees a glimmer hope\n\nThe constant switch between increased long and short liquidations in the past two weeks confirms this indecision. ETH may continue this sideways movement until key events like the Bitcoin halving and the SEC's spot ETH ETF approval decision take place. However, a bearish trend may begin if the price breaks key supports of $3,210 and $3,056 formed on April 5 and March 20, respectively.\n\nEthereum is trading at $3,500, up 0.8% at the time of writing."

        "content": "In a riveting turn of events, despite the Ethereum price showcasing a relatively slower movement compared to that of Bitcoin (BTC) and numerous altcoins, an intriguing phenomenon appears to have garnered noteworthy optimism on the world\u2019s second-largest token by global market cap. According to a recent report, the Ethereum token seems to have demonstrated notable enhancements in liquidity on centralized exchanges globally.\n\nThis amassed significant attention on ETH, underscoring an increase in the availability of ETH tokens for trading on exchanges, further indicating heightened interest and activity surrounding the token within the exchange ecosystem.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH\u2019s Liquidity: Diving Deep\n\nMeanwhile, despite the token\u2019s relatively slower price action, ETH\u2019s improved liquidity flagged growing confidence and participation among traders and investors within the market. This could potentially contribute to the token\u2019s long-term stability and market presence, adding a bullish tint to Ethereum amid the upcoming BTC halving.\n\nThe 2% market depth, which measures the quantity of buy and sell orders across exchanges, has notably increased from a yearly low of $255 million in October to a staggering $400 million at present.\n\nThese developments indicate a resurgence of market makers, who facilitate trading by providing liquidity. It further suggests that traders are benefiting from improved market conditions, with more opportunities for buying and selling ETH.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin Whale Sparks 800 BTC Selloff Fears Post-CPI Data Release\n\nBTC & ETH OI Hits ATH\n\nOn the other hand, open interest in perpetual futures contracts for both BTC and ETH has surged to unprecedented levels in USD.

        "content": "The next consensus layer-focused hardfork coming to Ethereum is the Electra upgrade and developers have been busy reinforcing the upgrade with certain EIPs that offer specific functions. The 4 key EIPs were teased by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim.\n\nEthereum Electra Upgrade Sees Multiple Implementation\n\nThe Ethereum Electra protocol is billed to go live on the testnet very soon. From discussions held during the last All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) bi-weekly meeting spearheaded by Ethereum Foundation (EF) Researcher Alex Stokes, Ethereum developers are integrating EIP 6110, EIP 7002, EIP 7251 and EIP 7549 into the Electra upgrade.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo far, these are the 4 code changes going into Electra \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n-EIP 6110 (Supply validator deposits on chain)\n\n-EIP 7002 (Execution layer triggerable exits)\n\n-EIP 7251 (Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE)\n\n-EIP 7549 (Move committee index outside attestation) pic.twitter.com/XXfYkkvCO2 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) April 9, 2024\n\nEIP 6110 which was created as far back as December 2022, is poised to supply validator deposits on-chain. According to the Ethereum Foundation (EF), \u201cThis EIP allows for an in-protocol mechanism of deposit processing on the Consensus Layer and eliminates the proposer voting mechanism utilized currently.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, the EIP 6110 will contribute to improving Ethereum\u2019s security and stability by changing the way that the network processes its validators\u2019 deposits.\n\nEIP 7002 can also be referred to as the Execution layer triggerable exits. It would allow validators to trigger exits via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials. There are still considerations from developers to make minor adjustments to this EIP that will equally trigger a change in Engine API.\n\nEIP 7251 is tagged \u201cIncrease the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE\u201d as it aims to allow validators to have larger effective balances while maintaining the 32 ETH lower bound. Noteworthy, EIP 7002 is a prerequisite for this EIP, hence, there are speculations that the implementation of EIP 7002 and 7251 in the same upgrade will trigger some complexities.\n\nDeveloper\u2019s Concern Highlighted\n\nFor EIP 7251, Lighthouse developer \u201cethDreamer\u201d coined two questions of concerns that would need to be addressed before the implementation. First, he is concerned about whether custom ceilings for partial withdrawals for validators with an effective balance greater than 32 ETH will be included.\n\nSecondly, he wants to know if consolidation of validators as a CL or EL-initiated operation should be enabled. Answers to these questions are expected from the next Ethereum developers\u2019 breakout meeting.\n\nEIP 7549 moves the committee index outside of the signed Attestation message. This is one of the most recently created EIPs.\n\n\u201cThis proposal aims to make Casper FFG clients more efficient by reducing the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules. While all types of clients can benefit from this EIP, ZK circuits proving Casper FFG consensus are likely to have the most impact,\u201d a statement from EF detailed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is undergoing intense evolution and Electra Upgrade is the next major after Dencun Upgrade which went live on the mainnet earlier this year.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "The weekly transaction volume of Tether (USDT) on Tron hit $110 billion in the first week of April, signaling heightened stablecoin activity on the network.\n\nAccording to a tweet by IntoTheBlock, Tether\u2019s latest milestone on Tron was 2x the amount the stablecoin settled on Ethereum. This indicates that Tron has maintained its position as the leading network for USDT transactions.\n\nUSDT Records $110B Volume on Tron\n\nIntoTheBlock attributed high USDT transactions on Tron to the network\u2019s low fees, saying that the blockchain has allowed users to access the United States dollar-backed asset easily.\n\nLast month, CryptoPotato reported that USDT transaction volume on Tron was rising to peak levels seen in January 2023. The stablecoin averaged roughly two million transactions daily on the network, an increase that began in February.\n\nTether\u2019s market cap recently hit $100 billion, strengthening the asset\u2019s dominance in the stablecoin space. While the stablecoin is available on 15 blockchains and protocols, a significant portion of its supply is on the Tron network.\n\nEarlier this year, Reflexivity Research discovered that roughly 94% of the stablecoin total value locked on Tron belongs to USDT. The dominance also extended to Tron smart contracts, for which USDT accounted more than 95%. The USDT contract consumes a large part of the on-chain energy, indicating that the asset was used for stablecoin transactions with limited diversification.\n\nUSDT Linked to Illicit Activities\n\nAs USDT expands its presence on Tron, so do illicit activities on the network. An analysis by blockchain forensics firm TRM Labs revealed that Tron accounted for 45% of illegal transaction volume in 2023, ahead of Ethereum and Bitcoin, which were responsible for 24% and 18%, respectively.\n\nTron has become the favored network of cyber criminals, North Korean hackers, terrorist financiers, and drug sellers due to its low gas fees and minimal price fluctuations. These criminals frequently exchange their stolen and illicit crypto assets, mainly for USDT, on Tron before they are laundered for over-the-counter trades.\n\nThe rising use of USDT for illicit activities has attracted scrutiny from several regulators. In January, a United Nations report even identified the stablecoin as a vehicle for money laundering and scams in Southeast Asia. However, USDT issuer Tether expressed disappointment at the UN\u2019s claims, insisting that the report only focused on the asset\u2019s alleged connection to illicit activities and not its positive impact."

        "content": "Historical design shown by the MVRV ratio, led ETH to bounce.\n\nWhile traders booked some profits, the OI indicated that more was close.\n\nOn the 8th of April, Ethereum [ETH] defied the school of thought that it was a slow move this cycle as its market cap jumped by over 9%. This increase placed its market cap at over $440 billion.\n\nDuring this time, the altcoin\u2019s price surpassed $3, 700 before its slight drop. But that was not the major highlight.\n\nThe past is sometimes the present\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed Ethereum\u2019s on-chain condition and observed the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This ratio provides insights into traders\u2019 buying and selling behavior. It can also help to spot the bottoms and tops of an asset.\n\nBetween the 1st and 7th of April, ETH\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was negative, suggesting an unusual buying opportunity in the region. This prediction was based on the cryptocurrency\u2019s history.\n\nFor instance, the ratio was -4.90 in October 2023 while ETH changed hands at $1,566. Weeks later, the price crossed $2,000. A similar scenario also occurred in January as ETH moved from $2,237 to $4,088.\n\nOn both occasions, the price increased by 21.7% and 45.27% respectively. This time, Ethereum has only increased by 7.89%. Should the historical pattern repeat itself, the price could rally toward $4,648 over the next few weeks.\n\nBut that might only be the case if the market does not experience extreme volatility that could cause prices to nosedive. If this is the case, then the bullish prediction might be invalidated.\n\nIs it time for surplus gains?\n\nIn the meantime, traders took advantage of the price increase to realize some profits. This was something that ETH holders could not boast of in recent weeks.\n\nA look at the daily on-chain transaction volume in loss showed that it was $129,000. On the other hand, the on-chain transaction volume in profit was about 238,000.\n\nIf the price of the cryptocurrency continues to increase, then the volume in profit could be double those in the red. But will Ethereum give in to the rally?\n\nTo ascertain this possibility, AMBCrypto looked at the Open Interest (OI). According to data from Coinglass, ETH\u2019s OI jumped to $14.41 billion.\n\nOI measures traders\u2019 activity based on net positioning. If the OI decreases, it implies an increase in positions closed. On the other hand, an increase in the metric suggests a surge in liquidity added to open positions.\n\nTherefore, the increase in the last 24 hours meant that more contracts had been opened, with buyers being the aggressive ones.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nLooking at ETH\u2019s price and the OI, it seems that the convergence might trigger a significant price movement.\n\nFrom a trading perspective, the large OI alongside the rising value might lead to a breakout. Should this be the case, ETH\u2019s rise above $4,000 could be next."

However, it is still down 58% from its record high.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum's price saw high volatility, primarily due to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US.\n\nThe recent news that BlackRock is planning to file an Ethereum ETF has boosted ETH prices above $2000 for the first time since July 2023.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2025\n\nGeneral predictions predict that Bitcoin halving in 2024 will dominate cryptocurrency narratives in 2025. Bitcoin and many altcoins are also expected to reach historic all-time highs 12-18 months after these halving events, so 2025 may be the year we see these increases.\n\nBased on these projections, ETH might achieve an all-time high of $6,600, a new low of $2,800, and an average of $3,200.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2026\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving event in April 2024 is expected to impact Bitcoin prices in 2025. However, experts say that we can expect a dip in 2026.\n\nSince cryptocurrency prices were in the spotlight last year, we expect governments to implement cryptocurrency regulations soon. There may be a slowdown in the current economic downturn if these regulations are positive and promote crypto evolution.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is likely to undergo scaling by this time, making it much more valuable. Despite no latest all-time highs, Ethereum is projected to average $4,500 in 2026, with sustained highs of $5,800, lows of $3,500, and no upcoming all-time highs.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2027\n\nEthereum is expected to see a great year in 2027 due to its continued institutional use and absence of price-halving events. After several big regulatory moves are implemented, the global economy is expected to grow steadily after the recession scares of 2022 and 2023.\n\nHowever, technical improvements are expected to make ETH more affordable and easier to use, which should counteract the growing demand. Due to these factors, ETH prices may fall into a narrow range in 2027.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2028\n\nIn the years leading up to the 5th Bitcoin Halving in 2028, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity. Investors are becoming more aware of the cycle and the expected rise in cryptocurrency prices. Ethereum's price might rise due to investor speculation. Whether Bitcoin and Ethereum undergo decoupling at this point remains to be seen. However, Ethereum's price will continue to be influenced by Bitcoin.\n\nThese factors predict that Ethereum's price might hit $6,300, close to its all-time high in 2025. Investors are unlikely to buy at higher prices. The median price fluctuates from $4,200 to $5,800.\n\nPrice prediction for ETH in 2029\n\nEthereum is expected to implement most upgrades by 2029. We may see more institutional and public networks used for business and personal stuff. Ethereum's widespread adoption is expected to transform commerce and value transfer.\n\nEven though many people believe the Bitcoin Halving event is already priced in, prices continue to rise. The price of Ethereum might hit a first-time 5-figure price of $10,200, with a low of $7,100 and an average of $8,800 if it retains its position among the world\u2019s most popular and widely-used smart contract platforms.\n\nFinal words\n\nEthereum is predicted to grow significantly over the next five years. However, it is important to remember that several factors can affect its price, like demand, development, competition, and market sentiment. The success of Ethereum depends on how well it can solve scalability issues, expand its applications, and stay on top.\n\nDisclaimer: The information, view and opinions provided in this article are being provided solely for promotional and informational purposes and should not be construed as investment, tax or legal advice."

        "title": "Ethereum vs BNB: 5 key differences in crypto futures this April - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "BNB\u2019s funding rate has been mostly negative since the beginning of the month.\n\nBNB accumulation remains steady in the coin\u2019s spot market.\n\nBinance Coin [BNB] is showing signs of weakness in the perpetual futures market. Coinglass\u2019 data showed that this month, it has experienced the most negative funding rates of the top five leading crypto assets.\n\nInformation retrieved from the data provider revealed that between the 4th and 8th of April, the coin\u2019s funding rate across exchanges was negative.\n\nFunding rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure that an asset\u2019s contract price stays close to its spot price.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s contract price is higher than its spot price, traders who have placed bets on a price rally (long traders) pay a fee to traders anticipating a decline (short traders). When this happens, the asset\u2019s funding rate will be positive.\n\nConversely, when the contract price is lower than the spot price, short traders pay a fee to traders holding long positions, resulting in negative funding rates. When an asset\u2019s funding rate is negative, more traders are holding short positions than there are traders expecting a price rally.\n\nEthereum vs BNB In comparing Ethereum and BNB, particularly in the volatile arena of crypto futures this April, several key differences emerge. Firstly, Ethereum\u2019s funding rates have remained more stable compared to BNB\u2019s dramatic shift from negative to positive within days. Secondly, while BNB showed a significant 29% increase in futures open interest, Ethereum\u2019s growth in this area has been more consistent, reflecting its broader market acceptance. Thirdly, BNB\u2019s quick rebound in the futures market contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s steadier, more predictable market movements. Fourthly, the negative funding rates experienced by BNB highlight a market sentiment that differs markedly from Ethereum, which typically enjoys a more balanced view among traders. Finally, the comparison of key momentum indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), would likely show differing trends between the two, with BNB recently witnessing a surge in accumulation not necessarily mirrored by Ethereum. These differences underscore the unique dynamics and investor sentiment driving each cryptocurrency, providing insightful perspectives for traders navigating the futures markets.\n\nSeparately, according to Coinglass, BNB\u2019s futures market sentiments have improved in the past four days, as the funding rate has remained positive. This has also been accompanied by a rally in the coin\u2019s futures open interest.\n\nAt $747 million at press time, BNB\u2019s futures open interest has increased by 29% since 8th April.\n\nThe market steadies\n\nAs of this writing, BNB exchanged hands at $611. Per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, its value has grown by 5% in the last week.\n\nAs the coin attempts to consolidate within a range, market volatility has reduced significantly. An assessment of BNB\u2019s Bollinger Bands showed a narrow gap between the upper and lower bands that make up the indicator.\n\nWhen the gap between these two bands is narrow, the market experiences low volatility. However, traders also interpret this as a signal that a breakout or significant price movement may occur in the short term.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nFurther, BNB\u2019s key momentum indicators rested above their respective center lines at the time of writing. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 61.19, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 51.44.\n\nThese values showed that BNB accumulation persisted among market participants."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF\n\nYEREVAN (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 On April 10, top Wall Street companies, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, expressed doubts about the potential of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, citing tough regulatory landscapes.\n\n\u201cWe were the first to file as well for ethereum in the U.S., and we and [Ark Invest CEO] Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,\u201d VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC, adding:\n\n\u201cThe way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and right now, pins are dropping as far as ethereum is concerned.\u201d\n\nVanEck\u2019s Ethereum SEC Skepticism. Source: A CNBC Crypto Forecast\n\nThe crypto community\u2019s excitement for a spot Ethereum ETF approval has been growing since the SEC approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The commission will decide on the matter by May, and it is highly likely that it will delay the decision.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has rallied by more than 60% in 2024 amid the growing ETF speculations, including a 10% jump in the past week.\n\nETH/USD Price Surge: Tracking the Rally on CoinGecko\n\nEthereum\u2019s Switch to Staking Complicated ETF Decision\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has emphasized that the agency views \u201cthe vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus fall under federal securities laws,\u201d albeit without mentioning Ethereum. Nonetheless, most cryptocurrencies that the SEC may deem as securities are proof-of-stake (PoS), a protocol that offers interest rate returns to people for their contribution to running a blockchain network.\n\nRelated: Is Buying Ethereum Too Risky Against SEC\u2019s Potential Crackdown?\n\nThis stance complicates the situation for an Ethereum ETF, given it recently changed its underlying consensus protocol to PoS. Meanwhile, CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti told CNBC on April 9 that they are observing the SEC\u2019s approach toward Ethereum \u201cvery closely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect any approvals to come before the end of this year,\u201d he remarked, hinting at the challenges of securing SEC approval for proof of stake, a protocol unique to blockchain technology."
