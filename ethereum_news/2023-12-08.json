        "title": "Funding Wrap: Bitcoin, Ethereum-based projects see fresh capital - Blockworks",
        "content": "Developers working with the two largest cryptocurrencies capitalized on early bull market intrigue.\n\nRecently, there has been a notable increase in funding interest towards bitcoin mining companies. However, this week\u2019s most substantial investment influx was directed at projects developing practical applications for the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a parallel trend, various projects focused on scaling Ethereum have also secured considerable support recently. This surge in investment comes as the network gears up for its anticipated Dencun upgrade, scheduled for next year.\n\nBabylon raised $18 million in a Series A led by Polychain and Hack VC. The company focuses on a unique protocol that allows Bitcoin to be used for staking in proof-of-stake networks. It offers a secure way for bitcoin holders to earn yields without needing third-party trust or bridging to other chains.\n\nRead more: Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year\n\nElsewhere, MAP Protocol, a layer-2 chain built on Bitcoin, announced a strategic investment from Waterdrip Capital. MAP is a Bitcoin layer-2 solution that seeks to enhance cross-chain interoperability. It enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin and other public blockchain networks, ensuring secure and efficient transactions across different platforms.\n\nBitcoin investment firm Swan Bitcoin said Thursday that it raised and spent $205 million in 2023 via its equity, credit and hedge funds. The company also said it plans to raise an additional $150 million as it builds out an institutional offering.\n\nRead more: Institutional custody of bitcoin could kill it, cautions Hayes\n\nOn the Ethereum side, Paradigm led a $9 million seed round in on-chain data platform Shadow. The engineering company streamlines on-chain data access by enabling efficient retrieval from contracts and transactions, and optimizing indexing. Its approach of moving event logs to shadow forks reduces gas costs and contract sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for blockchain data management.\n\nTen announced a $7.5 million raise for its encryption-focused layer-2, while another startup named Versatus said it closed a $2.3 million seed round for its \u201cstateless\u201d Ethereum rollup.\n\nDeFi platform shunts VC backing in favor of \u2018aligned\u2019 investors\n\nLending and borrowing app Curvance closed a $3.6 million seed round this week that was noticeably thin on venture capital investment. The protocol mostly raised funds from a group of DeFi and DAO actors, including Offchain Labs and Wormhole.\n\nThe platform\u2019s co-founder Chris Carapola said Curvance capped investment in the token sale at $250,000 per party and hopes to soon turn governance over to a DAO. By capping token sale investments, Carapola suggested Curvance was trying to prevent major voting inequality within the DAO.\n\nCurvance drew interest from venture capital, Carapola said, but decided to primarily raise funds from actors in its ecosystem instead, taking over a year to do so.\n\n\u201cI would say the consistent thing that we saw was, \u2018This sounds amazing. How much can we get, and can you increase the round, can we play with the [valuation], do you want to do a Series A,\u2019 like the more conventional route. And as soon as that really became the topic, it was like, \u2018you know you\u2019re not aligned, right?\u2019\u201d Carapola said.\n\nCurvance raised its seed round at a $56 million valuation and its private round at a $75 million valuation, Carapola said.\n\nOther notable fundraises\n\nAnimoca Brands raised an $11.8 million funding tranche to develop its Mocaverse \u201cFrequent Player Program\u201d with participation from Block1, OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Dapper Labs and others.\n\nWeb3 music streaming platform Sona raised $6.9 million from Polychain Capital, Haun Ventures and Rogue Capital.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum developers set roadmap for an eventful 2024 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) developers have outlined a comprehensive plan for the network\u2019s development in 2024, including significant upgrades and new proposals after their latest execution layer meeting on Dec. 8.\n\nA key focus is on the deprecation of the Goerli testnet, with a fork scheduled for early 2024. This move is part of the strategy to activate \u2018Dencun\u2019 on the Ethereum network in January, marking a significant advancement in its technological capabilities.\n\nDencun Activation\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will introduce a novel concept in transaction processing termed \u2018blob-carrying transactions.\u2019 In this context, \u2018blobs\u2019 is an acronym for \u2018Binary Large Objects\u2019. The primary purpose of these blobs is to refine the way Ethereum stores and retrieves data by reducing the amount of data that must be stored indefinitely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nConsequently, the transaction costs associated with data storage are expected to decrease, making overall transactions more economical. It is a critical step toward the long-term goal of danksharding, a planned scaling solution that breaks the network into smaller, parallel segments (shards) to increase capacity and efficiency.\n\nAnother notable development is the introduction of a new proposal aimed at enhancing the power of Execution Layer (EL) clients. The proposal, designed to counteract potential censorship in the mempool, would enable EL clients to override local builders using various heuristics.\n\nFor instance, clients could override when detecting transactions with excessively high fees pending for extended periods. However, adopting such heuristics has not yet been implemented broadly, with only Geth currently having an open pull request on the issue.\n\nIn terms of process updates, the development of a Meta Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for Dencun has been a significant milestone. This is complemented by a draft for a \u201cMeta EIP backfill,\u201d which aims to provide specifications for upgrades previously lacking Meta EIPs.\n\nThe discussion around Meta EIPs has been vital in simplifying access to fork specifications, although there is an ongoing conversation about their role and naming conventions, according to ETH developer Tim Beiko.\n\nPrague/Electra upgrade\n\nLooking forward, the Ethereum community is preparing for the Prague/Electra network upgrade. Among the proposals for this upgrade is EIP-6110, which proposes a new method for supplying validator deposits on-chain, replacing the older Eth1 bridge system.\n\nFuture upgrades may also include Verkle Tries on the Execution Layer and Data Availability Sampling (DAS) on the Consensus Layer, necessitating in-depth technical reviews and discussions.\n\nThe Ethereum community is encouraged to take an active role in shaping the future of the network by participating in these technical discussions and expressing their preferences for potential features in the upcoming upgrades through forums and GitHub threads.\n\nClient teams are set to review these proposals, with more detailed discussions planned for January. This planning forms part of the broader strategic development of the Ethereum network, reflecting the continuous efforts by the developer community to evolve and refine the platform.\n\nThe Ethereum developer community remains actively engaged in enhancing the network\u2019s capabilities, with a clear roadmap set for 2024. The upcoming developments and proposals highlight the network\u2019s ongoing commitment to innovation and responsiveness to community feedback."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe airdrops keep coming.\n\nThe team behind Starknet, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling network, plans to allocate over 1.8 billion STRK tokens to community members and stakeholders, according to an announcement made Friday by the Starknet Foundation.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation did not give a timeline for the airdrops, stating only that the first phase of the giveaway will begin \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nSome 900 million STRK tokens have been allocated to \u201creward past and future contributions by users and community members.\u201d What exact criteria will dictate which Starknet users will receive those tokens, and how many, has not yet been announced.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow that the news is out, we might as well tell you more! Starknet is about each of you. Every user, builder and member of our community \u2013 existing and future \u2013 is a critical piece to building our network into the future of decentralisation for generations to come. The success\u2026 \u2014 Starknet Foundation (@StarknetFndn) December 8, 2023\n\nA further 900 million STRK will go towards user rebates, the Starknet Foundation said. Planning for that initiative is still underway, but it appears it will recoup the cost of some amount of network transaction fees for Starknet users.\n\nBeyond those 1.8 billion tokens, the blockchain\u2019s overseers also intend to distribute an additional 50 million STRK tokens to incentivize decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Starknet. These tokens will be directly, indirectly, and retroactively distributed to Starknet DeFi users, according to the Starknet Foundation.\n\nStarknet community members were quick to celebrate the announcement, hailing it as a major boon for the blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n$Stark is about the community, 1.8B tokens for the community, 50M token for Defi chads.. multipliers incoming..! \u2014 BMS (@bloomstarbms) December 8, 2023\n\nAnd they have good reason to be in high spirits: similar airdrops made by other blockchain projects have flooded crypto users with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free tokens in recent weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, a similar airdrop by Solana-based DeFi platform Jito put $225 million worth of freshly minted JTO tokens in the hands of users and community members. Late last month, an airdrop for DeFi oracles network Pyth gave away $77 million worth of PYTH tokens.\n\nAirdrops have become an increasingly popular way for crypto projects\u2014and recently, DeFi projects in particular\u2014to attract a larger user base and encourage loyalty among existing community members.\n\nStarknet, which uses zero-knowledge rollups to make on-chain Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper, has already seen tremendous growth this year. This spring, the network\u2019s total value locked (TVL) increased ten-fold, from $1.45 million to over $10 million. Since then Starknet\u2019s TVL has tripled again, to $33.84 million at writing, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Crypto & Blockchain Quests - Global X",
        "content": "This piece is part of a series that dives deeper into the most prevalent themes of this year\u2019s iteration of our flagship research piece, Charting Disruption. The Crypto & Blockchain Quests section focuses on alternative currencies and stores of value, Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, and applications of blockchain technology.\n\nInnovations in blockchain technology have given rise to a burgeoning ecosystem of applications and use cases that have the potential to improve the financial independence of global populations, drive exponential efficiency gains across business and industry, and bring the form factor of value into the digital age. Central to these innovations are the software developers who build the infrastructure, creator tools, and user-facing applications that endow blockchain networks with utility.\n\nThrough cycles past, strong market activity has incentivized software developers to enter the digital asset industry, a significant percentage of whom become full-time contributors to blockchain development. Encouragingly, these developers have continually remained committed to the industry even when the cyclical hype triggered by rising asset prices retreats. It is during these periods of more sober public sentiment surrounding blockchain technology that today\u2019s most valuable products have been built. The most recent market cycle seems to be no different, with infrastructure development over the past year providing a robust foundation that may give rise to new use cases, driving the next wave of blockchain adoption.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe role of cryptoassets as credible, location-agnostic mediums of exchange and stores of value can provide a critical lifeline for populations struggling with social, economic, and political instability.\n\nBenefitting from infrastructure upgrades of the Layer 1 (L1) blockchain with \u201cThe Merge\u201d and a growing network of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, Ethereum is laying the foundation needed if it is to achieve its goal of becoming a globally adopted value settlement layer.\n\nThe diversity of applications on blockchain networks is continually growing and ranges today from decentralized finance (DeFi), to asset tokenization, to a host of non-financial use cases such as social media and resource sharing.\n\nUnlocking Digital Assets: Alternative Currencies & Stores of Value\n\nThe role of cryptoassets as location-agnostic stores of value and mediums of exchange is perhaps the most prominent application of digital assets today. These use cases can provide a critical lifeline to those without access to a stable national currency or a viable means of storing and growing wealth.\n\nGrowing from a $1B industry in 2017 to a $120B industry today, stablecoins have emerged as an efficient vehicle for short-term preservation of purchasing power for many global populations, especially those struggling with hyperinflationary conditions and systematic currency debasement.1 Though still a nascent industry, stablecoins are regularly involved in trillions of dollars of global value transfer annually, rivaling payments giants such as Visa.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has solidified its role as a powerful hedge against currency debasement and global uncertainty. Supported by assurances that the total supply of bitcoin will never exceed 21 million tokens and that the network will never be controlled by a central authority, bitcoin\u2019s value proposition as a credibly scarce and neutral asset has continued to gain traction globally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Blueprint: Exploring Infrastructure Upgrades\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake-\u2014\u201cThe Merge\u201d\u2014 represented a broad overhaul of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. The outcome of The Merge was a 99.9% reduction of Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption and a simultaneous slashing of network expenses to 0. Today, Ethereum\u2019s minimal environmental footprint and sustainably profitable operations put the network in a position to achieve its goal of becoming a global settlement layer.\n\nUpgrades to the canonical Ethereum blockchain (L1) were also supported by innovations in \u201cLayer 2\u201d (L2) networks aimed at scaling Ethereum and reducing transaction costs to support the viability of a wider range of consumer applications. Since 2021, over 30 L2 scaling networks have been launched on Ethereum, including optimistic and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups. To date, L2s have increased Ethereum\u2019s transactional throughput by 5x and reduced average transaction costs by orders of magnitude.2 These myriad benefits have catalyzed a migration of blockchain activity away from L1 and on to L2s which now host the majority of Ethereum\u2019s transaction execution.\n\nBlockchain Trends: Applications of the Technology\n\nDriven by drastic improvements in blockchain infrastructure and user experience, the diversity of blockchain applications is quickly expanding. Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that enable activities such as asset exchange, yield generation, and lending have garnered the greatest mind share and adoption to date, with billions of dollars of capital regularly processed by the most popular applications. Further, asset tokenization has made significant strides in progressing from a promising concept to one that is being applied to investment fund management, real estate, stablecoins, and more.\n\nA growing cohort of non-financial applications are being developed as well. These include novel experiments to extend the efficiencies of the sharing economy to areas such as data storage and internet hot spots, crowdsourcing initiatives to incentivize activities such as real-time 3D mapping, and a new social media paradigm whereby content creators are empowered to own their content as well as their entire social graph.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrontier technological movements challenge societal notions of what is and is not possible. Eventually, the most successful of these movements distinguish themselves by progressing beyond a conceptual phase and into phases of active experimentation and implementation. With significant advancements in blockchain scalability and security over the past few years, blockchains have emerged as increasingly viable solutions for a wide range of applications, with multinational businesses, governments, and a growing global user base taking note and actively experimenting with the technology. As innovation continues, the expectation is that blockchain capabilities will become increasingly relevant to a growing swath of use cases and will eventually become fully integrated into everyday activities."

        "content": "LONDON - The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant activity with both and reaching yearly highs, causing a substantial increase in transaction fees. A recent market rally pushed Bitcoin to its annual peak price of $45,000 on December 5th before it stabilized above $43,000. Following this surge, IntoTheBlock reported on December 8th that Bitcoin's on-chain activity had spiked, leading to a more than 60% increase in transaction fees.\n\nEthereum has also seen remarkable growth, setting new yearly highs on Friday by reaching $2,390. This latest milestone came with daily gains that surpassed Bitcoin's incremental rise. Despite Ethereum's success in price and an increase in whale dominance\u2014with these large holders now owning 35% of the total supply\u2014there has not been a corresponding surge in new user acquisition for the network.\n\nThe rise in transaction fees for Bitcoin outpaced that of Ethereum's, which saw nearly a 50% fee growth. This fee inflation typically indicates a heightened demand for processing transactions on each blockchain, often reflecting increased investor interest and market activity.\n\nAs both cryptocurrencies showcase robust performance, the market is closely watching these developments. The spike in fees particularly underscores the growing costs associated with the surging demand for blockchain space during market rallies. Investors and users are now navigating a landscape where heightened activity can lead to higher costs for transaction processing on these networks.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "content": "Fri 08 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin has long played the role of the undisputed leader, paving the way for its crypto brethren. But, as in any good epic tale, a challenger arises: Ethereum. As we approach the end of 2023, we might be witnessing the dawn of a new era, where the altcoin is no longer content to follow but aims to compete. Is it the season of altcoins? In this financial ballet, Ethereum sketches a daring dance to catch up with the Bitcoin giant. Let\u2019s analyze this captivating plot together.\n\nCrypto ETH: The Phoenix of Altcoins?\n\nYesterday, a remarkable event occurred: Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency reached a new annual high of $2,312, demonstrating resilience worthy of a phoenix.\n\nWith a 10.28% progression in one week, Ether is no longer the timid younger sibling following in its elder\u2019s footsteps. Against a still-dominating Bitcoin, this crypto seems to whisper a promise: \u201cNothing is played out yet.\u201d This meteoric rise, although impressive, asks a burning question: how high can Ether go in this frenzied race?\n\nETH, like a maestro, has masterfully directed its dance around a graphical triangle, signaling a bullish target of $2,780. This geometric figure is not just a crypto trader\u2019s whim; it is a strategy, a meticulously planned plot.\n\nThe Ichimoku indicators, with their colorful curves, seem to play a harmonious melody, supporting this ascent. But beware, every story has its twists. If ETH falls below its protective cloud, this dream of $2,780 may vanish, reminding us that falls are always possible.\n\nETH: The New Hero?\n\nSo, are we witnessing the emergence of a new hero in this crypto saga? Ethereum, with its current configuration, seems to have all the trumps to hit its target. But in this world where caution is queen, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is as unpredictable as a stormy ocean.\n\nThe question remains: Can Ethereum, strengthened by its ascent, truly reach $2,780 before the end of the year, and in this odyssey, can it redefine the rules of the game established by Bitcoin?\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum\u2019s rise is more than just a market fluctuation; it is a true digital odyssey, redefining the dynamics of power in the world of cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin continues to dominate, Ether, with its recent performance, prompts deep reflection on the future of altcoins. Is it a mere resurgence, or are we witnessing the dawn of an era where altcoins, led by Ethereum, play a leading role? The future, albeit encrypted, looks thrilling. In a world where surprise is the only constant, one thing is certain: the crypto realm will continue to mesmerize, astonish, and perhaps, overturn established titans.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana\u2019s upward momentum continued unabated into Friday, with SOL posting double-digit gains and Solana\u2019s leading meme coin BONK extending its skyrocketing surge to another all-time high. Amid the price action, Solana NFTs are also seeing substantially more trading volume\u2014even higher than on Ethereum.\n\nSOL popped as high as $73.85 early Friday, marking a new 19-month peak for Solana\u2019s native cryptocurrency. While still far from its all-time high of nearly $260 in November 2021, SOL has seen a dramatic rebound from falling to almost $8 in late 2022. As of this writing, Solana sits at just above $73, marking a 13% jump in the last 24 hours per CoinGecko.\n\nMeanwhile, BONK\u2014the top meme coin on Solana\u2014has continued its rocket ship ride up the charts in recent weeks, setting a new all-time high price of $0.00001314 early Friday.\n\nEven down to $0.00001230 as of this writing, BONK has posted a 24% gain in the past 24 hours, and has tripled in price over the past seven days. During the last month, BONK is up a whopping 982%, flinging the token into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap for the first time. BONK now has a market cap of $747 million.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the recipients of Thursday\u2019s Jito airdrop are sitting even prettier. The Solana DeFi platform\u2019s new JTO token was handed out to thousands of early users, with the airdrop valued at $225 million in total as of late Thursday. But now the price has jumped 72% over the past day to $3.35 per token.\n\nBuzz around Solana extends to its NFT collections, too.\n\nProjects like Mad Lads and Tensorians have seen dramatic price increases in recent weeks, multiplying several times in price. And now, collective Solana NFT trading volume has topped that of Ethereum, typically the leading chain for volume and having the most valuable projects.\n\nSolana NFTs racked up $14.8 million worth of trades over the past 24 hours, per data from CryptoSlam, compared to about $13.9 million worth on Ethereum. It\u2019s due to a sizable boost in Solana trades, which have seen their volume grow about 92% in the past day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTensorians, which is tied to the Tensor NFT marketplace, is the top traded project during that span with over $4 million worth of sales.\n\nTensor, which rose to prominence earlier this year, is currently dominating on Solana with nearly 76% market share over the past 24 hours per data from Tiexo. Magic Eden, the multi-chain marketplace that previously owned the Solana space, has about 16% share during that span.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Starknet, a zk-proof-based Ethereum layer-2, is taking a significant step towards decentralizing its network and fostering community engagement.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation outlined its plan to distribute over 1.8 billion STRK tokens through various initiatives aimed at driving adoption and growth on its blockchain platform.\n\nThe token, which is not currently transferable or tradable, was first deployed on Ethereum in November 2022, and ever since speculation has been rife that the network would eventually conduct an aggressive program of community incentives and a retroactive airdrop targeting active Starknet users.\n\nAn X thread on Friday from the Starknet Foundation brought the contours of this eventual distribution into clearer relief.\n\nAt the heart of the initiative is a \u201cprovisions committee,\u201d entrusted with the responsibility of allocating 900 million STRK tokens. This committee\u2019s goal is to ensure a \u201cfair, decentralized and transparent distribution of STRK over multiple programs and phases,\u201d according to the Foundation.\n\nIts objective is to distribute ownership of the network\u2019s native token and to reward past and future contributions.\n\nHow exactly this will be done remains to be seen, and a Starkware spokesperson declined to comment further.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is independent of Starkware Industries, which is headquartered in Netanya, Israel, but its seven person board includes both Starkware co-founders Eli Ben-Sasson and Uri Kolodny.\n\nThe company was valued at $8 billion following its 2022 Series D fundraise.\n\nIn addition to rewarding contributions, the Starknet Foundation aims to reward users for their transactions on the Starknet network, such as offering rebates for transaction fees.\n\nStarknet fees are denominated in ether, and the network posts zero-knowledge proofs of execution of transaction batches to Ethereum mainnet \u2014 a security and scaling mechanism.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nThe Starknet Foundation is also exploring ways to incentivize activity in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, working with an initial allocation of 50 million STRK tokens. A six-member \u201cDeFi Committee,\u201d currently concluding its research phase, will soon start implementing strategies to enhance liquidity, trading volume and overall growth of DeFi protocols on Starknet.\n\nRead more: Starkware\u2019s new appchain attracts DeFi derivatives dex with CeFi liquidity\n\nStarknet teased that further details on its incentive mechanism aimed at developers and decentralized applications (dapps) on the Starknet network would be forthcoming next week.\n\nSince the token currently has no secondary market, it\u2019s challenging to ascribe a value to the planned distribution, but layer-2 peers Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum currently boast fully-diluted markets caps of between $8 billion and $11 billion.\n\nThe total supply of STRK tokens is 10 billion, of which 5 billion were allocated to the Starknet Foundation.\n\nThe airdrop is one of many anticipated in 2024 related to Ethereum layer-2 networks, such as LayerZero and zkSync.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The Bitcoin narrative continues to steer the ship, but a closer look reveals the total altcoin market cap playing catch-up. With Ethereum and BTC leading the way, we are potentially on the brink of an altcoin surge.\u201d\n\nThe founders also predict increased volatility for Bitcoin\u2019s price but a rally continuation. They say that the crypto king could dip to the $40,000 level while remaining in an overall uptrend.\n\n\u201cBTC\u2019s bullish momentum: navigating the uncharted journey to $46,000.\n\nDespite the four-hour timeframe indicating BTC is overbought BTC\u2019s upward trend may persist, intensifying investor FOMO (fear of missing out) across the board.\n\nTechnically, BTC navigates uncharted territory towards $46,000. Expect volatile moves between $40,000-$46,000. The 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) provides a safety net for potential pullbacks, making shorting risky. Current patterns hint at a climb towards $45,000.\n\nConclusion: stay alert, but optimistic. Yet the BTC\u2019s momentum suggests more upside.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $43,424 at time of writing, down slightly in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe two also use the Elliott Wave theory to suggest that the total market cap for cryptocurrencies could soar to an all-time high (ATH) of $4.4 trillion during the current bull cycle, surpassing the previous ATH of about $3 trillion.\n\nThe Elliott Wave theory attempts to forecast price movements based on crowd psychology which tends to manifest in waves. Traditionally, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that price impulses happen in five waves after three-wave \u201cABC\u201d corrections.\n\n\u201cThird time a charm? When crypto starts its move, it goes vertical by the end of the move! The journey has just begun. And RSI (relative strength index) is in the \u2018extremely bullish\u2019 zone. Are you strapped up for this move? Extreme euphoria may likely be seen by the end of the rally.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, the total crypto market cap stands at $1.69 trillion.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Global investment management firm VanEck\u2018s 2024 predictions for crypto suggest a transformative year ahead for the sector, highlighting pivotal events and trends set to redefine the digital asset landscape from economic fluctuations to groundbreaking technological advancements.\n\nThe forecasts are based on analysis beyond just the crypto sector, looking at economic trends, technological developments, and regulatory dynamics. From the anticipated U.S. recession\u2019s intertwining with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, aiming to bolster Bitcoin\u2019s resilience above $30,000, to the fourth Bitcoin halving poised to elevate its market value, these predictions spotlight pivotal moments in crypto\u2019s journey.\n\nFurther, VanEck\u2019s outlook predicts Ethereum to retain its position beneath Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance while simultaneously outshining major tech stocks and facing competition from other smart contract platforms. The NFT market, which will be fueled by both Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2024, is expected to scale new heights, reshaping the landscape of digital collectibles. Meanwhile, the stablecoin realm, particularly with USDC, anticipates unprecedented growth.\n\nThe predictions also highlight the potential shift in exchange supremacy, with Binance\u2019s leading spot trading position challenged by emergent rivals. Additionally, DEXs are projected to claim a significant slice of the spot trading market. A breakthrough is anticipated for blockchain-based gaming, with a game surpassing one million daily active users, marking a milestone in mainstream acceptance.\n\nRobbie Ferguson, Co-Founder and President of Immutable, told CryptoSlate,\n\n\u201cRecognition from VanEck, one of the world\u2019s top 10 ETF issuers, is exceptional validation of the work we\u2019ve been doing for web3 games since we built the first decentralized game on any blockchain in 2017[\u2026] This endorsement further validates our platform strategy, and relentless focus on an exceptional end player experience.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Solana\u2019s ascent to a top-three blockchain position, along with the rise of DePi networks like Hivemapper and Helium, anticipates broad diversification within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nFinally, a pivotal area highlighted by VanEck is the integration of Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols in decentralized finance (DeFi), expected to usher in a new era of institutional participation. This, along with new corporate accounting treatments for crypto holdings, signals a shift towards mainstream and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nVanEck predicts spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved in Q1.\n\nIn 2024, VanEck predicts the U.S. economy to enter a recession amidst slowing economic momentum and cooling inflation. This downturn, marked by 19 months of consecutive decline in leading indicators, weak commodity markets, and increasing corporate bankruptcies, sets a challenging backdrop. Yet, in this economic landscape, the debut of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will be approved in Q1.\n\nVanEck forecasts that these ETFs will attract substantial investment, drawing a parallel with the early success of the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF launched in 2004. The GLD ETF experienced rapid inflows, capturing a notable fraction of the gold market within its first quarter. Applying these metrics to Bitcoin, adjusted for the current era\u2019s higher money supply, the prediction is a striking initial influx of around $1B, potentially reaching $2.4B within a quarter for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThis significant capital flow into Bitcoin ETFs reflects a deeper shift in the financial landscape. With the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s M2 money supply considerably higher than during the GLD launch, the potential for Bitcoin ETF inflows is magnified, leading to an estimated $40.4B over the first two years. This surge is partly driven by a predicted preference for Bitcoin as a form of \u2018hard money\u2019 amidst concerns over sovereign debt levels and inflation, positioning it as an alternative to gold among investors.\n\nFurthermore, the expected lower transaction costs of these ETFs, compared to current retail trading fees, suggest a potential for broader market adoption. Such cost efficiencies historically have catalyzed the widespread acceptance of new technologies and could similarly propel Bitcoin ETFs into the financial mainstream. Despite the looming recession and potential market volatility, these developments indicate a robust demand for Bitcoin, potentially sustaining its price above $30k in the early phase of 2024.\n\nImpact of the Bitcoin halving and new Bitcoin ATH.\n\nVanEck predicts that the fourth Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April, will unfold smoothly without major disruptions. This halving is likely to lead to the disconnection of unprofitable miners, shifting the landscape towards those with more efficient, low-cost power solutions. Despite the initial adjustment period, where the market might experience some consolidation, Bitcoin\u2019s value is projected to rise. VanEck predicts that following the halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price could surpass the $48k mark, aligning with the technical pattern observed in April 2022. This uptrend is expected despite some miners potentially underperforming compared to Bitcoin\u2019s price, with low-cost miners like CLSK and RIOT predicted to outshine others. The post-halving period might also see significant growth for at least one publicly traded miner.\n\nThe second half of 2024 could bring even more dramatic developments for Bitcoin. Amid a backdrop of global political shifts and an increase in global voting participation, Bitcoin is anticipated to scale new heights. This period of heightened political activity and potential changes in regulatory landscapes, particularly following a significant U.S. presidential election, sets the stage for Bitcoin to potentially achieve an all-time high. VanEck speculates that by Nov. 2024, Bitcoin could hit a new peak in value, potentially reaching $100k by the year\u2019s end. This scenario, marked by a departure from certain regulatory stances, could lead to a landmark moment for Bitcoin and its perception in the global financial system.\n\nThe Flippening won\u2019t happen, but DeFi will rise.\n\nEthereum is set to make significant strides but will not surpass Bitcoin in market dominance. Ethereum\u2019s performance is expected to outshine even the largest tech stocks, but it will not achieve the long-speculated \u201cflippening\u201d to overtake Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s clearer regulatory status and its appeal due to its energy-intensive mining process are anticipated to draw increased interest from state-backed entities in regions such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. Notably, Argentina might join the ranks of countries like El Salvador and the UAE in state-level Bitcoin mining support, focusing on utilizing stranded methane and gas resources.\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions are poised for substantial growth following the implementation of EIP-4844, which promises to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees. This upgrade is expected to catalyze a consolidation within the Ethereum network, with two to three Layer 2 chains emerging as dominant players. These leading chains could potentially surpass Ethereum in monthly decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and total value locked (TVL). This shift is likely due to the reduced transaction costs enabling more efficient trading and arbitrage opportunities. By the fourth quarter of 2024, these Ethereum Layer 2 chains collectively might double Ethereum\u2019s current DEX volume and exponentially increase transaction numbers, signaling a significant evolution in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nIn total, VanEck made 15 predictions for crypto in 2024, listed below:\n\nU.S. Recession Arrival and Debut of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Uneventful Fourth Bitcoin Halving Bitcoin\u2019s All-Time High in Q4 of 2024 Ethereum\u2019s Market Position Behind Bitcoin in 2024 Dominance of ETH Layer 2s Post-EIP-4844 NFT Activity Peaks to New Heights Binance Relinquishes Top Position in Spot Trading Stablecoin Market Cap Hits Record High with USDC Market Share Recovery Decentralized Exchanges Attain Record Spot Trading Market Share Bitcoin Yield Opportunities Driven by Remittances and Smart Contract Platforms Emergence of a Leading Blockchain Game Solana Outperforms Ethereum with Resurging DeFi TVL Meaningful Adoption of DePin Networks Corporate Crypto Holdings Boosted by New Accounting Standards DeFi\u2019s Reconciliation with KYC Regulations\n\nThe full report from VanEck is available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\n13.15 GMT: Updated to include comment from Immutable.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Crypto analysts at the investment management giant VanEck are predicting big things for the Ethereum (ETH) competitor Solana (SOL) in 2024.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, and Patrick Bush, a digital assets senior investment analyst, predict that Ethereum will lose market share to Solana next year due to the latter project having \u201cless uncertainty surrounding their scalability roadmap.\u201d\n\nThe analysts also predict that Solana will rise to become a top-three blockchain by market cap, total value locked (TVL) and active users.\n\nThe TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts. TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets. Solana currently ranks sixth among chains in terms of TVL, according to the decentralized finance aggregator DeFi Llama.\n\nSigel and Bush also predict that Solana will join the race for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. So far, financial firms have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ETFs.\n\nSOL is trading at $74.05 at time of writing. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 6.65% in the past 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The meme coin market has seen an uptick in the past week, with Cardano\u2019s Snek (SNEK) and Solana\u2019s Bonk (BONK) experiencing immense gains.\n\nThese meme-inspired coins on different blockchains have rallied impressively, attracting retail investors seeking the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.\n\nWith meme coin momentum showing no signs of slowing down, some experts wonder if a new Ethereum-based token may be next to ride the hype.\n\nSNEK Surges After Investor FOMO Boosts Forgotten Meme Coin\n\nIt\u2019s been an excellent week for SNEK holders, with the coin\u2019s price rising almost 170% since last Friday.\n\nSNEK is now trading for $0.00079, its highest value since June.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, over $3.5 million worth of SNEK exchanged hands in the past 24 hours \u2013 a 49% increase from the previous day.\n\nThis highlights the renewed interest and hype surrounding the token in recent days.\n\nThe Cardano-based meme coin had gone quiet for months after its initial price surge when it launched earlier this year, but fresh waves of investor demand have now pushed its market cap back over $54 million.\n\nMuch of this newfound momentum comes from the current bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ethereum rallying powerfully, speculative coins like SNEK tend to benefit from the spillover hype.\n\nAlthough its fundamentals may still be lacking, SNEK\u2019s price action hints that further upside could be ahead.\n\nBONK Price Explodes Over 5,500%, Hitting All-Time High\n\nThe BONK meme coin on Solana has seen ever more parabolic price action than Cardano\u2019s SNEK this past week.\n\nAfter trading sideways for most of the year following January\u2019s spike, BONK has suddenly caught fire and rocketed over 5,500% since the start of November.\n\nBONK recently hit an all-time high of $0.000012, with the token now boasting a market cap of $710 million.\n\nThis makes BONK the third-largest meme coin globally, flipping Pepe (PEPE) coin.\n\nMuch like SNEK, BONK has benefited from the return of speculation to the crypto sector in the past three months.\n\nThanks to the market\u2019s strength, the entire Solana ecosystem has seen renewed developer and investor interest.\n\nAs the SOL token began to rally, it brought visibility and liquidity to projects built on the network, positively affecting BONK.\n\nMajor exchange listings have also played a key role in BONK\u2019s trajectory, with the buzz around the token showing no signs of abating.\n\nCould an Ethereum-Based Meme Coin Could Explode Next?\n\nWith meme coin mania hitting networks like Cardano and Solana, attention now turns to whether an Ethereum-based project could be next to benefit from the speculative wave.\n\nEthereum has lagged behind Bitcoin\u2019s powerful rally in recent months, yet the ETH/BTC pair surged almost 8% yesterday.\n\nThis shows capital flowing back into Ethereum and is beginning to benefit existing meme coins like Pepe (PEPE), which is up by 9% since yesterday.\n\nMoreover, some investors now believe Ethereum\u2019s strength could provide scope for a relatively unknown project to break out in a similar fashion to SNEK or BONK.\n\nTwo potential candidates include Meme Kombat (MK) and Wall Street Memes (WSM).\n\nMeme Kombat features an AI-powered battle arena where users can place bets on the outcomes of hilarious fights between meme coin mascots.\n\nAlongside the battle arena, Meme Kombat has a staking protocol where investors can lock up the native MK token and earn yields of 318% annually.\n\nIn terms of coins already listed on exchanges, Wall Street Memes is a meme coin inspired by the values of those who took down the short sellers during GameStop\u2019s short squeeze in 2021.\n\nWSM has already climbed the ranks of the top meme coins on CoinMarketCap, with room to grow as its FDV is still under $50 million.\n\n$WSM is currently listed on Uniswap and OKX, and $MK is available to buy at memekombat.io.\n\nBoth MK and WSM feature the viral potential that could help them attract a surge of interest from internet communities if Ethereum continues gaining ground.\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and BONK.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nETH\u2019s price booked a 12% increase this past week after it was finally able to escape the ascending triangle that has been forming since 2022.\n\nThe breakout above $2,150 started this rally, which may not see any significant pullback until $2,500. That is the current target for this move. If buyers remain aggressive, they could aim to take Ethereum to $3,000 after that.\n\nLooking ahead, the momentum is bullish, and ETH is showing signs it may recover some of the ground lost to Bitcoin in the past few weeks.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP is also bullish and managed to book a 5% increase this week. However, the resistance at 68 cents is still to be broken before this cryptocurrency can aim for higher levels.\n\nThe support at 57 cents held well, and considering that buyers are dominating the market right now, XRP could continue to perform in the coming week.\n\nLooking ahead, this cryptocurrency could break the current resistance and aim to reach the previous high from July when XRP got close to $1.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nADA bulls woke up this week with an impressive 28% price increase. This spectacular performance obliterated the resistance at 46 cents, and now buyers are looking at much higher levels.\n\nThe most important resistance on the chart right now is found at 60 cents. Sellers may attempt to stop this rally around 50 cents, but that is unlikely to last, considering market sentiment.\n\nLooking ahead, if ADA manages to maintain this momentum, then going to 60 cents becomes likely.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nThis week, Solana broke the resistance at $67 and booked a 16% price increase. This allowed buyers to take it to $72 today.\n\nIf bulls remain strong, then the previous resistance at $67 can turn into support, and Solana can move higher still and towards $80 next.\n\nLooking ahead, this cryptocurrency continues to show strength and this latest breakout confirms that bulls are very much still in control.\n\nBONK\n\nThe surprise of the past two months is BONK, the biggest meme token on the Solana network. The price has not stopped pumping since late October and booked an eye-popping 187% increase this week alone.\n\nWith such a performance, it is almost impossible to guess where BONK will top or decide to correct. After a 70x increase from its all-time low, this Solana token could continue to rally, considering the market sentiment.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems meme tokens are back in the spotlight, and BONK holders are having the time of their life."

        "content": "In a strategic move, the popular online brokerage platform Robinhood has announced the launch of its cryptocurrency trading feature in Europe. The platform has intentions to expand its range of tokens and introduce additional features, such as cryptocurrency transfers, staking, and educational rewards, in the year 2024.\n\nThis development follows Robinhood\u2019s recent expansion plans beyond the United States.\n\nRobinhood Launches Crypto Trading App\n\nRobinhood\u2019s latest crypto product is designed to allow European customers with the ability to buy, sell, and hold more than 25 tokens. Among the featured cryptocurrencies are popular names like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot. The platform aims to broaden its token selection further, with plans to introduce additional cryptocurrencies and enable features like token transfer and staking by 2024.\n\nThe Robinhood Crypto app will only be available to individuals in Europe aged 18 and above, effective from December 7th. It is now accessible on both iOS and Android devices.\n\nThe newly introduced crypto application imposes no trading fees, and users will also get a percentage of their monthly trading volume back in Bitcoin. The app will display the spread, including the rebate received from sell and trade orders, and will also offer comprehensive pricing to eliminate customer concerns related to concealed fees, ensuring they receive the maximum value in crypto for their Euros.\n\nIn an official statement, Johann Kerbrat, GM of Robinhood Crypto said,\n\n\u201cWe believe crypto is the financial framework for tomorrow and that it plays a significant role in our mission to democratize finance for all. For this reason, we\u2019re thrilled to expand crypto trading to customers throughout the EU, enabling them to buy and sell their favorite tokens safely and securely.\u201d\n\nWhy EU?\n\nRobinhood has been cautious about its cryptocurrency operations. In June, the company took proactive measures to voluntarily restrict the trading and holding of specific tokens for its US clientele, coinciding with a period when the government was adopting a more hostile stance toward major trading platforms like Binance and Coinbase.\n\nIn contrast to the regulatory scrutiny faced by crypto firms in the US, the European Union has taken a proactive approach by proposing the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation to ensure the traceability of cryptocurrencies for anti-money laundering purposes and to shield merchants from fluctuations in the market.\n\nWhile addressing the motive behind choosing Europe, Kerbrat said\n\n\u201cThe EU has developed one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive policies for crypto asset regulation, which is why we chose the region to anchor Robinhood Crypto\u2019s international expansion plans.\u201d"

        "title": "Solana Handles 70% of Ethereum DEX Volume as SOL Blows Past $70 - Coinfomania",
        "content": "The Solana DeFi ecosystem has witnessed tremendous growth in the past few weeks. Some of the biggest beneficiaries are decentralized exchanges on the network, which are seeing record-breaking volumes.\n\nNotably, the rapid rise in volume has also seen Solana edge closer to major competitor Ethereum. In the 24 hours before press time, Solana-based DEXes handled $1.01 billion in trading volume, or around 70% of Ethereum\u2019s volume over the same period. The much older network settled $1.434 billion, maintaining its edge as the largest blockchain network for DEX trading.\n\nSurging DEX volume on Solana is primarily attributable to a proliferation of ecosystem projects launching their tokens via airdrops, thus increasing liquidity. Blockchain oracle service provider Pyth Network recently completed its airdrop, with Jito (JIT) following up with an airdrop on Thursday.\n\nAcross the Solana ecosystem, the leading destinations for users include liquid staking protocols, Marinade Finance and Jito, which control a sizeable portion of the total value locked on the network. Lending protocols, Margin and Solend, are not far off, contributing a combined $350 million of TVL.\n\nMeanwhile, the growth in Solana\u2019s DeFi ecosystem may also be linked to the network\u2019s inherently lower transaction fees and faster transaction speeds when compared to Ethereum. In comparison, Ethereum has struggled to keep up with increased demand, resulting in high costs and slow transaction times.\n\nSOL Surges Past $70\n\nIncreased capital and user engagement with the Solana ecosystem have affected the price of its native coin, SOL. In the past 24 hours, SOL has surged past $70, reaching its highest level since May 2022.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, SOL was trading at $72, representing a 12.79% increase in the last 24 hours and an 18.32% surge in the past seven days. The token has surged 62% in the past month and 423% since the beginning of the year."

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Resurfaces, Transfers $87.5 Million to Kraken - West Island Blog",
        "content": "In the vast depths of the cryptocurrency market, a long-silent Ethereum giant has created ripples by stirring from its five-year slumber. Emerging from the shadows, the anonymous whale has made a colossal splash by transferring a staggering 39,260 ETH\u2014estimated to be worth a cool $87.5 million\u2014to the exchange platform Kraken.\n\nThis momentous haul, uncovered by the keen eyes of on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, spotlights a dramatic move that\u2019s set tongues wagging across the crypto sphere. This whale\u2019s actions are particularly noteworthy in light of the fact that they\u2019re poised to reel in a haul of profit on an investment that\u2019s swelled by an astronomical 670% since mid-2017.\n\nTRUSTED PARTNER \u2705\n\nIn a time where the cryptocurrency market has basked in renewed vigor, the Ethereum currency has gleefully ridden this wave of enthusiasm. Just recently, the digital asset recorded an impressive 11% uptick within a single week.\n\nYet, the transfer conducted by this formidable Ethereum player far exceeds mere statistical curiosity. Acquired for an average of $240 per ETH during the buoyant days of June to August 2017, the digital trove cost around $11.34 million at the outset. The whale had since submerged into a dormant state, with their stash appreciating massively as Ethereum flourished.\n\nHowever, the recent transfer to Kraken could signify an intention to capitalize on the accrued riches\u2014a move that could yield them profits in the region of $78 million should they choose to liquidate their entire collection.\n\nThe phenomenon of cryptocurrency whales cashing out has become an increasingly observed pattern, sparking wide speculation and heated debate within the digital finance community. Recent on-chain data has chronicled other high-rollers who have followed suit, dispatching their ETH to various exchanges. From the remnants of once-mighty exchanges like FTX and Celsius to the actions of big-time players like Galaxy Digital, hefty transactions have been flowing onto the ledgers of marketplaces such as Coinbase and Binance.\n\nAmidst this tumultuous backdrop, Ethereum\u2019s market stance remains a delicate dance. Although it recently brushed against the $2,300 mark, the increased selling pressure that coincides with sizeable transfers seems to have slightly nudged its value downward.\n\nAs uncertainty shrouds the crypto markets, savvy observers are watching with bated breath. Will Ethereum confront the resistance barrier at $2,200 or will it power through to reclaim higher ground? Only time will tell if the bulls can maintain their charge or if the most recent moves portend an impending breather for the currency\u2019s valiant ascent."
