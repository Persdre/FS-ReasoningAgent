        "content": "In a pair of interviews on Wednesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler still didn\u2019t seem very excited to be discussing the Bitcoin ETFs approved by his agency on Jan. 10.\n\nAnd he doubled down on previous remarks that approving the investment vehicles didn\u2019t equate to the agency changing its mind about Bitcoin\u2019s potential risks, merely that it was a reaction to the August decision in Grayscale v. SEC where the agency, according to Judge Neomi Rao, \u201cfailed to reasonably explain\u201d why it had previously approved Bitcoin futures products but not spot ETFs.\n\n\u201cWhile we had denied two dozen of these, a court in Washington said we did not get that right, and it got remanded to us. The most sustainable thing to do is to approve these given the court ruling,\u201d Gensler told Bloomberg News.\n\nThe SEC chair, both in that interview and earlier in talking to CNBC, reiterated his concern over the links between Bitcoin and illicit actors, and the multitude of crypto exchanges that face little to no oversight. It\u2019s why, Gensler noted, the recently approved ETFs are Bitcoin-specific\u2014although he didn\u2019t elaborate on why Ethereum didn\u2019t deserve similar consideration.\n\n\u201cThis is a field that has been rife with fraud and manipulation, and look at all the bankruptcies,\u201d Gensler said on CNBC when asked whether the problem was Bitcoin itself or the currency potentially being misused. \u201cIt\u2019s entity, after entity, after entity.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Gensler acknowledged that although regular currencies issued by governments are used illegally, such as for money laundering, those issued by central banks also play a massive role in supporting established economies. Meanwhile, he added, Bitcoin and crypto just \u201chave the market share of ransomware.\u201d\n\nGensler also was asked about such criticisms aimed at crypto, especially in the wake of the ETF approvals, and he insisted his agency remains impartial. \u201cWe\u2019re merit neutral if someone is complying with the law,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the later Bloomberg interview, Gensler elaborated on his skepticism of crypto trading platforms, Bitcoin\u2019s relative volatility when compared with other assets, and the lack of use cases for many cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWe really do look to ensure as best we can there\u2019s no fraud or manipulation,\u201d Gensler continued, \u201cbut one of the challenges of the Bitcoin market is that so much is traded on trading platforms that are not compliant with our laws.\u201d"

        "content": "Two Ethereum traders made $120 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe traders employ a 'looping' strategy in DeFi, enabling leveraged positions on Ether to amplify their investments.\n\nUpcoming Ethereum upgrades and the potential approval of an Ether ETF are key market catalysts, potentially driving Ether's price even higher.\n\nA pair of high-value Ethereum traders are up nearly $120 million today as crypto prices continue to jump.\n\nAccording to DL News\u2019 analysis, two wallet addresses, 0x28 and 0x74, have used various lending protocols to increase their exposure to Ether.\n\nCombined, these wallets hold over 1.1 million in Ether and staked Ether derivatives \u2014 worth $3 billion. Both wallets are deposited in a handful of lending protocols like MakerDAO, Spark, Morpho and Compound.\n\nThe identities of wallet owners aren\u2019t publicly known, but these wallets caught attention in 2022 for nearly being liquidated for $600 million worth of Ether. Now, that risky bet has paid off.\n\nLooping on DeFi\n\nThe strategy these whales \u2014 a term for high-value crypto traders or investors \u2014 employ is commonly referred to in DeFi as looping.\n\nA trader deposits an asset, such as Ether, into a lending protocol and then borrows a different asset, like dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, against their deposit. They then swap that DAI for Ether, the original asset.\n\nAfter swapping cryptocurrencies, the trader re-deposits the newly-acquired Ether back into the lending protocol. This action allows them to borrow additional funds, establishing what\u2019s called a \u2018leveraged long position\u2019 on their original Ether deposit.\n\nThe looping strategy enables traders to achieve a leverage of 3-5x \u2014 multiplying capital by a factor of 3 to 5 times \u2014 on their initial investment.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut in this case, these whales have opted for a more conservative leverage range of 1-2x. Despite its potential for higher returns, this strategy carries a multitude of risks. A significant drop in the Ether price could lead to liquidation, resulting in the loss of the initial deposit.\n\nThe pair of whales deployed these strategies years ago when Ether was worth around $1,000. Ether is currently trading around $2,700. The price of Ether would have to drop over 60% for them to be liquidated.\n\nEthereum catalysts\n\nTraders who utilise the looping strategy inherently hold a bullish sentiment \u2014 conviction that the prices will go up \u2014 on the market.\n\nFor Ether, there are a couple of significant catalysts on the horizon.\n\nEthereum's Ether token has performed well over the past year.\n\nThe first is the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which will reduce the cost of transactions on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. After successful tests on two of Ethereum\u2019s test networks, the upgrade is slated to come to Ethereum mainnet around March 13.\n\nThe weeks leading up to major Ethereum upgrades generally coincide with increased interest in the Ethereum network, and some researchers even find that it causes Ether\u2019s price to increase.\n\nSince the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, the market has turned its sights to an Ether spot ETF.\n\nHeavyweights like Blackrock, Fidelity, Invesco and others have all already applied for an Ether spot ETF, with a decision to be made by May 23.\n\nGiven the Bitcoin ETFs hold 692,000 Bitcoin, or 3.53% of the total supply, traders are hoping an Ether ETF would see a similar success.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "content": "NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of digital asset that is unique and indivisible, meaning another asset of equal value cannot replace it. Ethereum and NFTs are often associated with each other, as they are typically created, traded, and stored on the Ethereum network. Ethereum\u2019s smart contract capabilities allow for the creation of unique tokens, which can be used to represent digital assets such as art, music, videos, and other types of creative works. These tokens are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a secure and transparent way to verify digital asset ownership and transfer.\n\nIn addition to providing a platform for creating and trading NFTs, Ethereum also provides a way to establish royalties and other payment structures for the use of digital assets. This allows creators to benefit from their digital works\u2019 ongoing use and value. Overall, the relationship between NFTs and Ethereum is symbiotic, as the Ethereum blockchain provides a powerful platform for creating, trading, and establishing value for these unique digital assets. As NFTs continue to gain popularity and use cases, it is likely that Ethereum will remain a key player in this emerging space."

        "title": "How the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Will Affect Ethereum\u2019s Market - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is on the edge of its seat as the next Bitcoin halving event approaches in 2024, an event that promises to reshape the landscape for Bitcoin and its peer cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Are you looking to know about the effect of the upcoming Bitcoin halving on Ethereum?\n\nIn this blog, we will look at the effect of Bitcoin halving on Ethereum, its effect on investor sentiment, market liquidity, and the interplay between supply and demand.\n\nImpact of past Bitcoin halvings on Ethereum prices\n\nThe effects of Bitcoin\u2019s second and third halving events on Ethereum\u2019s prices, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market, offer insights into the intricate dynamics between leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nEffect of Ethereum prices after the second Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 9, 2016, and was characterized by a significant reduction in the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. This event had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency market at large, including Ethereum.\n\nThe price of one ETH went from $14 before the BTC halving to $11 at the time of halving. Experts noted that the price of Ethereum kept plummeting up to 25% until the halving occurred in July 2016. Post-halving, the price of ETH displayed some signs of recovery.\n\nAt the end of three months following the halving, the price of ETH was only 1.8% higher, signifying a stunted recovery.\n\nLet us understand the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s staking supply, which recently crossed 25%, providing key insights into its resilience and potential for growth.\n\nEffect of Ethereum prices following the third Bitcoin halving\n\nThe third Bitcoin halving took place on May 11, 2020, further reducing the block reward to 6.25 BTC. This event preceded a dramatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. The anticipation and aftermath of the halving contributed to a bull market in cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe price of one ETH, before halving, stood at $160. However, after the halving process, the price of ETH experienced a significant spike, with prices immediately reaching up to $211. After a month following the Ethereum halving, the price of ETH soared even further to a staggering $249.\n\nWithin three months of halving, ETH went up by a whopping 88.6%, priced at $398, as compared to the time of halving.\n\nHow will the upcoming Bitcoin halving affect Ethereum in 2024?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 is anticipated to significantly influence Ethereum prices through various interconnected mechanisms and market dynamics. Here\u2019s a detailed exploration of the points mentioned:\n\n1. Historical performance and market dynamics\n\nEthereum\u2019s price dynamics in relation to past Bitcoin halving events offer valuable insights. This pattern suggests that Ethereum could similarly benefit from the 2024 Bitcoin halving.\n\nSuch trends highlight Ethereum\u2019s growing integration and responsiveness to Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles, suggesting potential bullish momentum for Ethereum in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2024 Bitcoin halving.\n\n2. Deflationary mechanisms\n\nThe Ethereum network\u2019s transition to a deflationary model, particularly through mechanisms like the Ethereum triple halving, plays a crucial role in its value dynamics.\n\nThis triple halving encompasses reduced ETH issuance, the burning of ETH via EIP-1559, and staking rewards, all of which contribute to reducing the circulating supply of ETH. This deflationary pressure is likely to enhance Ethereum\u2019s appeal as an investment, especially in the context of the crypto market\u2019s cyclical booms typically triggered by Bitcoin halving events.\n\nSuch mechanisms ensure that Ethereum\u2019s supply dynamics are increasingly favorable, making it a compelling investment in the broader narrative of digital scarcity and value appreciation post-Bitcoin halving.\n\nReflect on the aftermath of the last Bitcoin halving by exploring these five essential insights, offering valuable lessons for Ethereum investors anticipating the next halving event.\n\n3. Investor sentiment and strategic investment\n\nThe anticipation surrounding Bitcoin halvings often generates significant market interest, potentially leading to increased investment in Ethereum as part of broader cryptocurrency market gains.\n\nInvestment strategies like diversification and Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) become particularly relevant as investors look to mitigate the volatility associated with halving events while capitalizing on potential market upswings.\n\nThis strategic shift in investment behavior could see more capital flowing into Ethereum, buoyed by its solid fundamentals and the speculative interest generated by the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAmid speculation about Ethereum\u2019s future, explore all potential bearish scenarios for Ethereum, providing a balanced view of its prospects as the Bitcoin halving approaches.\n\n4. Technological innovation\n\nThe halving event underscores Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and the technological resilience of blockchain networks, setting a backdrop that encourages innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum\u2019s foundational role in decentralized applications (dAFpps) and its ongoing development initiatives position it favorably for continued growth and adoption.\n\nThe broader context of technological innovation and scarcity, highlighted by Bitcoin\u2019s halving, reinforces Ethereum\u2019s value proposition, potentially driving its price up as the market anticipates increased adoption and use-case expansion.\n\n5. Regulatory landscape and security measures\n\nThe evolving regulatory framework and advancements in security protocols across the cryptocurrency sector are pivotal to Ethereum\u2019s investment outlook. As the industry seeks regulatory clarity and enhanced security measures, the overall appeal of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, is likely to increase.\n\nThis is particularly relevant in the period surrounding the Bitcoin halving, where market optimism and the influx of institutional and retail investment can be significantly influenced by perceptions of regulatory stability and security.\n\nGemini\u2019s report highlights the potential impact of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals on the market, suggesting that similar regulatory milestones could positively affect Ethereum by enhancing its legitimacy and accessibility to a broader investor base.\n\nEthereum price prediction following the 2024 Bitcoin halving\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $2800.29. As we look toward the future of Ethereum, our projections predict that by the end of 2024, Ethereum is expected to reach approximately $3200, marking a significant upturn from its current valuation.\n\nWhile this forecast positions Ethereum\u2019s price notably below its peak historical high, it signals robust confidence in the asset\u2019s growth potential and resilience within the volatile crypto market.\n\nThis anticipated rise reflects the dynamic nature of Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem, driven by continuous innovation and its pivotal role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, hinting at a promising horizon for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s 11th AMA sheds light on the future of scalability and security, factors crucial for understanding Ethereum\u2019s positioning in a post-halving crypto market.\n\nWhy should you invest in Ethereum in 2024?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum in 2024 could be a strategic move for various reasons, based on insights from multiple sources:\n\n1. An ecosystem of dApps\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s largest ecosystem for dApps. With almost 3000 dApps running on its blockchain, Ethereum offers a wide range of utilities beyond simple transactions, including DeFi games, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and more. This diverse application base could drive further demand for Ethereum.\n\n2. Ethereum Merge completion\n\nThe Ethereum Merge, transitioning the network from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), marks a significant upgrade. It makes Ethereum greener and more scalable, which could attract more users and developers, potentially increasing the value of Ethereum over time.\n\n3. Innovation and uncensorable apps\n\nEthereum\u2019s platform enables the creation of uncensorable applications, providing a level of freedom not controlled by central authorities. This capability emphasizes its role in fostering innovation across various sectors, including electricity, healthcare, and finance, positioning Ethereum as a host for groundbreaking solutions.\n\n4. Staking rewards\n\nWith the shift to PoS, Ethereum staking has become an avenue for earning passive income. Stakers contribute to network security and, in return, receive rewards. This not only supports the Ethereum ecosystem but also offers a sustainable earning opportunity for investors.\n\n5. Long-term price potential\n\nAlthough predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently speculative, some analysts remain bullish on Ethereum\u2019s long-term trajectory. Anticipations of continued growth in the DeFi sector and Ethereum\u2019s fundamental strengths suggest the potential for price appreciation in the years to come.\n\nThese reasons highlight Ethereum\u2019s pivotal role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domains, emphasizing its potential as a valuable investment in 2024. However, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the crypto market is highly volatile, and investing in cryptocurrencies carries risks. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial situation and risk tolerance before investing.\n\nConsider the broader market dynamics with a look at the impact of Bitcoin ETFs and three events that could trigger a bull run, offering perspectives on Ethereum\u2019s market potential in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s cyclical events.\n\nSumming up\n\nIn conclusion, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and its effect will be a watershed moment for Bitcoin and Ethereum. While it\u2019s clear that the event will have far-reaching implications, the exact nature of its impact on Ethereum\u2019s market remains to be seen.\n\nAs such, both investors and enthusiasts should closely monitor the developments leading up to and following the halving, as they will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s market in the years to come."

At press time, the number of active validators \u2013 those currently securing the Ethereum blockchain and not waiting in the queue \u2013 exceeds 943,000.\n\n\u201cThe validator queue started to increase in the beginning of Feb, while the ETH staking yield is still below 4%. This [increase] coincides with EigenLayer\u2019s staking cap raise on 2/5,\u201d wrote Kelly Ye, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, in a Telegram message to Unchained.\n\nARVE Error: src mismatch\n\nprovider: youtube\n\nurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxsVKw7SdAs&t=7s\n\n\n\nsrc: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs?start=7&feature=oembed\n\nsrc mod: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs?start=7\n\nsrc gen: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PxsVKw7SdAs\n\n\n\nError: src mismatch\n\nMore ETH Available to Be Restaked\n\nWith 32 ETH each, the roughly 8,300 validators will bring in about $746.3 million in total to secure Ethereum. Consequently, this also means that more ETH is available to be restaked.\n\nEigen Layer, the protocol widely known for its restaking technique that extends Ethereum\u2019s security to additional applications and networks, has been a popular destination for crypto denizens\u2019 liquid staking tokens (LST).\n\nPeople have been able to deposit their LSTs into EigenLayer, but the team placed caps on each LST pool. The team has temporarily lifted caps on the number of LSTs people can deposit into the protocol several times. The latest cap raise occurred on Feb. 5, which saw the value locked in EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts more than triple from $2.156 billion to nearly $7.034 billion in 10 days, data from DefiLlama shows.\n\nAs the number of validators entering the population outpaces those leaving, the rewards per validator will continue to shrink. Ethereum staking APR started at above 5% in June 2023 and has since decreased 129 basis points to nearly 3.8% at press time, according to data provided by beaconcha.in.\n\nHowever, Decentral\u2019s Ye noted that \u201cwe expect ETH staking interest to continue to grow as the staking theme continues to grow. ETH currently has about 32.5% staked, which is still lower than other big [proof-of-stake] chains.\u201d\n\nThe price of ETH, the native cryptocurrency for Ethereum, has increased 3.2% in the past 24 hours and 17.5% over the past seven days to trade at $2,851, data from CoinGecko shows."

        "title": "Points Season: Who's Winning the NFT Marketplace Wars on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe \u201cpoints\u201d meta has overtaken the crypto space as of late, and NFT marketplaces across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin are jumping on the bandwagon (and in some cases driving it) in an attempt to win the hearts, minds, and wallets of traders everywhere.\n\nWill points translate to token airdrops? Will the NFT market return to its former glory? And if so, which company is in the best position to win the NFT marketplace wars? Here\u2019s how things are shaping up so far:\n\nMagic Eden is the latest NFT marketplace to try and lure in users through points-like loyalty models that could pay off with a token drop or other rewards. The marketplace recently launched its Diamonds rewards system, which includes a retroactive drop of rewards to Solana traders dating back to 2021.\n\nEthereum marketplace Blur pioneered the points model, and it was this time last year that the upstart platform dethroned longtime leader OpenSea by dropping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BLUR tokens to its most loyal users. By the end of the year, Blur had given away $818 million worth of BLUR tokens after users racked up points.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTensor, the leading Solana NFT marketplace, has employed a similar points-based loyalty model, and similarly overtook leader Magic Eden last year\u2014but Tensor still has yet to launch its crypto token. To be clear, Tensor has yet to officially announce a token airdrop tied to the points, though it has teased such sentiments in the past.\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s launch of its Diamonds system\u2014starting on Solana, but expanding to Bitcoin, Polygon, and Ethereum soon\u2014signaled an apparent attempt to catch up to Tensor. Similarly, we don\u2019t know yet what Magic Eden\u2019s points-like Diamonds will actually be used for, though there\u2019s also a separate NFT token drop coming in parallel with the rewards system.\n\nIs Magic Eden\u2019s rewards shift paying off in terms of boosting its market share? So far, not really.\n\nMagic Eden briefly saw a Solana surge that suggested it was making up ground on Tensor. On February 5, Decrypt observed that market data from analytics platform Tiexo pointed to Magic Eden claiming a 41% share of Solana NFT volume over the previous 24-hour period, compared to 53% for Tensor. That was much closer than it had been in recent weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, as of this writing, Tensor commands about 73% of Solana NFT market share over the past 24 hours, per Tiexo, compared to just 22% for Magic Eden. Zooming out a bit, there isn\u2019t a significant shift over the past weeks. In the last seven days, Tensor has over 75% share compared to 19% for Magic Eden; in the last month, Tensor claims over 73% with Magic Eden at less than 22%.\n\nImage: Tiexo\n\nExpanding the data to include platforms across several major NFT chains, however\u2014including Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain\u2014reveals some other interesting details about how rewards models are further reshaping the marketplace wars.\n\nLooking at the broader landscape, Blur rules the market by a wide margin, commanding about 42% market share over the past week. That\u2019s entirely on Ethereum mainnet, still the leading blockchain for NFTs, and Blur\u2019s existing token and history of sizable airdrops to users appears to be propelling its continued dominance.\n\nTensor is second overall with about 14.5% market share among tracked networks, all on Solana, followed by Magic Eden with 14%\u2014with the majority of that volume coming from Bitcoin Ordinals sales.\n\nOpenSea, which has no points system and has long resisted calls to launch its own token, lands in fourth with about 12.4% share, primarily on Ethereum and scaling network Polygon. Bringing up the rear is OKX\u2019s marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals, which are similar to NFTs, with about 7.7% market share.\n\nTiexo\u2019s 24-hour data shows some deviations due to the smaller sample size, with Blur holding an even larger share at 52.5% and Magic Eden up second with just under 12%\u2014but the majority of that volume is on Bitcoin, likely due to Tuesday's sale for the Bits gaming project. OpenSea, Tensor, and OKX bring up the rear, in that order.\n\nImage: Tiexo\n\nMagic Eden is readying a significant push on Ethereum with the launch of a new marketplace for that chain, created in partnership with Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs. Set to debut on February 27, the marketplace has also set alliances with the teams behind major Ethereum projects like Pudgy Penguins and Azuki.\n\nWill the launch of Magic Eden\u2019s new Ethereum marketplace, with associated Diamonds rewards, help turn the tide and provide a sustainable boost as it battles rivals? We\u2019ll see later this month, as it\u2019s the next big shift on the horizon\u2014although the NFT world is ever full of surprises.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Guillermo Jimenez"

        "content": "ENS Labs asks DAO about settlement offer and reimbursement for legal expenses.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) has asked the ENS DAO to vote on a potential settlement over eth.link.\n\nEth.link is used as a resolving service for .eth names. People can type a second level .eth name followed by eth.link to get the name to resolve in their browser.\n\nThe person who registered the domain went to prison for helping North Korea evade sanctions and the domain expired while he was in prison.\n\nThe domain was registered at Uniregistry, which had an expired domain auction partnership with Dynadot. Dynadot auctioned the domain for $852,000, with Manifold Finance as the winning bidder.\n\nEthereum Name Service subsequently sued GoDaddy (which owns Uniregistry), Dynadot, and Manifold Finance. The domain was transferred to ENS due to a temporary injunction, but the case continues.\n\nManifold was dismissed from the case due to a lack of jurisdiction, but might still have a claim on the domain. The company has now offered to settle the dispute for a $300,000 payment.\n\nENS Labs is putting the settlement offer out to the ENS DAO. It is also asking the DAO to reimburse its legal expenses to date, which total about $750,000.\n\nGiven the legal expenses incurred to date and likely future expenditures, the settlement seems to be a bargain for ENS, assuming that the other parties also agree to the settlement and don\u2019t demand their legal expenses to be reimbursed.\n\nIt appears that ENS Labs wants to avoid further legal expenses. It says that if the DAO refuses to reimburse it for its legal expenses, \u201cENS labs will act to minimise its further expenses by having the case dismissed.\u201d\n\nA settlement would also be helpful because ENS would no longer be entangled in a lawsuit with GoDaddy. Despite the lawsuit, GoDaddy worked with ENS to integrate its new gassless wallet connection into the GoDaddy registrar."

        "content": "However, although disagreement is extremely important in finance, in this paper we intend to sidestep the fundamental discussion about cryptocurrencies. We will focus instead on the cold, hard numbers, and examine the return, risk, and correlations of the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market shares \u2013 Bitcoin and Ethereum. We will then use those numbers to provide some insights into whether they justify an allocation, and to what extent. And we will examine that in the context of three industry standard approaches to portfolio construction \u2013 the Global Market Portfolio, Risk Parity, and Optimization. Each have their own merits and idiosyncrasies, and each will attack potential allocations to cryptocurrencies from a slightly different angle. Sure, it might not be as much fun as a full-blooded and torrid debate, but it will be based on facts and well-researched forecasts, and not opinions \u2013 surely not a bad thing for investors. Figure One alludes to one of the many ways in which digital assets are disrupting traditional finance. It shows the indexed returns to several traditional assets (global stocks and bonds, denominated in US dollars), as well as the returns to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies to date which together account for approximately 70% of the space. Note that we use post-2017 data to accommodate for data availability, mainstream media awareness for the asset class, and growing institutional interest (e.g., Bitcoin CME futures launching in 2017).\n\nHowever, before you conclude that Bitcoin and Ethereum have generated returns broadly like traditional assets, but with a more volatile path, take another careful look at the chart. You will see that we have had to present the returns on a compressed scale on the left-hand side of the chart (technically known as a \u201csemi-log scale\u201d). And the reason is that because the cryptocurrency returns have been so extreme (effectively exponential) that showing everything on a more usual linear scale would reduce the bond and stock market returns to, effectively, a flat line."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRonin, a Ethereum sidechain designed for blockchain games, announced Thursday that it will reduce RON token rewards paid to liquidity providers on its Katana decentralized exchange (DEX) starting in March.\n\nSky Mavis, the company behind the network and its flagship game Axie Infinity, said that it plans to cut liquidity pool token emissions in multiple waves, slashing the daily token rewards by approximately 50% each time. Doing so will reduce the number of tokens being added to the circulating supply on a daily basis.\n\nThe network said that the average annual percentage rate (APR) for providing liquidity has jumped from around 20% to 70% in recent months. However, the amount of tokens pooled has not grown proportionally to match the increase in rewards.\n\n\"This means the increase in reward value did not drive meaningful outcomes in DEX liquidity provision, and may have gone past the optimal level of incentives,\" the announcement said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, rewards will be reduced in phases. The first phase, planned for March 1, will cut emissions by over 60,000 RON per day, or around 5.4 million RON per quarter. At the current price, that\u2019s a cut of more than $174,000 worth per day or $15.6 million worth each quarter.\n\nAdditional phases will continue reducing rewards over the course of 2024. The reduction aims to curb \"over-incentivization\" of liquidity providers and lead to better equilibrium for token prices, according to the network. It will also free up more of the RON token supply for other initiatives that could drive user growth.\n\nThe market reacted positively to the news, as the price of RON jumped shortly after the announcement, according to data from CoinGecko. Ronin is up 7% on the day to a current price of $2.90, pushing the token\u2019s 30-day gains to 56%. RON was just listed on major crypto exchange Binance earlier this month, which was cited as one of the reasons behind this rewards cut.\n\nThe network has seen a dramatic rise in active users over the last few months after the blockchain-based farming game Pixels migrated over from Polygon in October. Pixels will launch its own PIXEL token on February 19 after running a play-to-airdrop campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Ethereum price is rallying at an impressive rate alongside its peer Bitcoin, which almost touched $53,000 on Thursday. Investors seem to be spoilt for choice, especially with altcoins making incredible strides. As discussed earlier today, investors are likely to start redistributing capital from Bitcoin profits into altcoins, propping tokens like ETH for a larger breakout targeting $4,000 in Q1.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: A Rally In The Making\n\nEthereum price bullish outlook comes amid impressive performance of Bitcoin ETFs which achieved a humongous cumulative net inflow of $4 billion on February 1.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInvestors perceive this surge as validation of Bitcoin and crypto from traditional investors. ETFs allow institutions to seek exposure to BTC without dealing with the complexities associated with navigating exchanges, owning physical digital and assets which require special custody services.\n\nAway from the BTC ETF, Ethereum is poised for a larger breakout due to the upcoming Dencun upgrade. All three testnet launches have been completed implying that developers will be announcing the final dates for the mainnet debut before the end of Q1.\n\nOptimism for a spot Ethereum ETF has also started to build. Following the approval of BTC ETFs, speculators turned to Ethereum as the next-in-line digital asset.\n\nThe approval of an Ether ETF, although a long shot at the moment, considering the hawkish stance of regulators in the US on whether Ethereum is a security or not, is expected to drive prices higher as witnessed with Bitcoin.\n\nAmid these expectations and potential market mover factors, Ethereum seeks a breakout above $2,800 to extend the leg to $3,000 and subsequently to $3,600 before the end of February.\n\nFor starters, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator backs the uptrend, displaying a buy signal and green histograms above the neutral area.\n\nIf interest in ETH continues this week, holding above $2,800 would signal confidence in the uptrend and possibly ignite FOMO among investors as they speculate on further price increases this week.\n\nSupport is expected at $2,700 on the downside. However, if profit-taking destabilises Ethereum price, traders may want to consider $2,500 and $2,200 as key support areas.\n\nBlockchain data by IntoTheBlock reveals that over 7.8 million Ethereum addresses are currently in profit, while 5.45 million addresses deal with unrealized losses.\n\nThe largest support area stands out at $2,365 \u2014 the average price at which 1.72 million wallets purchased slightly over 5 million ETH. Based on the chart below, Ethereum price has a higher chance of rallying to higher levels above $3,000 as opposed to dropping to January\u2019s support at $2,200.\n\nThat said, Ethereum could still be a steal if bought at the current market value. In case of dips to lower support areas, consider a dollar-cost average strategy to make the most out of the sublime bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "The recent movement of a sizeable quantity of Ethereum (ETH) from Binance to an unidentified wallet, as revealed by Whale Alert, has generated a great deal of curiosity and conjecture in the cryptocurrency world. This transaction, which involved 11,999 ETH worth over $31.8 million, demonstrates that whales are responding strategically to the state of the market.\n\nThe positive mood has been prevalent in the cryptocurrency market, as evidenced by the large rises in Ethereum and other altcoins, as well as in Bitcoin. Whale Alert\u2019s latest observations suggest that whales of ETH might be taking advantage of this momentum by hoarding more of the cryptocurrency, possibly in anticipation of future price rises.\n\nSignificant cryptocurrency transfers from exchanges to private wallets frequently indicate bullish optimism among leading market participants. These transfers may lead to price increases if demand increases or stays constant since they decrease the amount of goods offered on exchanges. A further layer of intrigue to market dynamics is provided by the activation of a dormant premine address containing 100 ETH after 8.5 years, which suggests the return of long-term holders to the market.\n\nThe idea of heightened market interest and perhaps optimistic mood is further supported by the present price of Ethereum, as well as by the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent performance and the spike in Open Interest in Ethereum futures. These occurrences are critical events that might point to important changes in the dynamics of the Ethereum market and have an impact on future price movements.\n\nEthereum Gains Momentum\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s euphoric ascent reaching $50,000, focus is now turning to Ethereum, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Regarding ETH\u2019s future course, there is also growing optimism among analysts, including Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, as reported by TWJ.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current price, as reported by Coinmarketcap, is $2,661.01. Almost 180% more has been traded for the digital asset in a 24-hour period, with a volume of almost 19 billion. ETH has increased by 7.11% in the last 24 hours and by 14.53% on the weekly chart. This optimistic momentum highlights ETH\u2019s tenacity and suggests room for more expansion."

        "title": "Why Are Creators Minting NFTs On Bitcoin Rather Than Ethereum? - DisruptionBanking",
        "content": "Artists, creators, and collectors have all sought to capitalise on the explosive growth of the non-fungible token (NFT) market. While Ethereum has long been the preferred blockchain for minting NFTs, a new trend has emerged in which crypto natives are turning to Bitcoin as an alternative. This shift prompts an examination of the reasons behind this transition and an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of using Bitcoin for NFT minting.\n\nThe Rise of NFTs and Ethereum\u2019s Dominance\n\nNFTs have changed the way we perceive and monetise digital content, giving creators a means to authenticate and monetise their work in the digital world. Ethereum, with its robust smart contract capabilities and established ecosystem, emerged as the de facto platform for NFT minting and trading. Its smart contracts work under ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, providing a framework for creating and exchanging NFTs, as well as for interoperability and liquidity within the growing NFT market.\n\n\n\nHere are 5 token standards you need to know about.https://t.co/ngj3v0dUPq \u2014 nft now (@nftnow) June 8, 2023\n\nThe Case for Bitcoin NFTs\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the NFT space remains undisputed, a growing number of individuals are exploring the viability of Bitcoin as an alternative platform for minting NFTs. Here are some factors that may have contributed to this shift:\n\n1. Bitcoin\u2019s Brand Recognition and Network Effects:\n\nBitcoin enjoys the most brand recognition and network effects as the pioneer cryptocurrency blockchain. Using Bitcoin\u2019s iconic status, proponents believe that minting NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain enhances their perceived value and marketability, tapping into the broader Bitcoin community and investor base.\n\n2. Security and Immutability:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain is popular for its excellent security, stemming from its extensive hash power. By minting NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, creators benefit from Bitcoin network\u2019s unparalleled security.\n\n3. Layer 2 Solutions and Scalability:\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin still struggle with scalability challenges and high gas fees, and Ethereum has seen various solutions helping this challenge. However, Bitcoin, too, has seen the emergence of Layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network. These off-chain scaling solutions enable faster and more cost-effective transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it an attractive option for NFT minting.\n\n4. Interoperability and Cross-Chain Integration:\n\nThe growing need for interoperability between different blockchain networks will open up for cross-chain integration. This will allow NFTs minted on the Bitcoin blockchain to seamlessly interact with other ecosystems and platforms.\n\nBitcoin NFT project Taproot Wizards has sold out its first collection, Quantum Cats, raking in $13M from the sale of the 3,000 digital images made with the Ordinals inscriptions protocol.https://t.co/5WY0mfK33O \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) February 10, 2024\n\nAdvantages Of Using Bitcoin for NFT Minting\n\nOne significant advantage is its reliability. Bitcoin still boasts the only ecosystem that is totally decentralised. This virtue allows Bitcoin transactions to be irreversible, ensuring secure transfers of digital assets without the risk of fraud or forgery\u2014a great and appealing option for NFT minting.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s brand recognition is also an attractive attribute. As the legacy blockchain, its pull for NFT marketability and value can be skyhigh.\n\nThere is also Bitcoin\u2019s cost effectiveness. Transaction fees are typically low, making NFT creation accessible to a wide range of users. Also, the widespread acceptance of Bitcoin by exchanges and businesses simplifies the process of transferring tokens.\n\nDisadvantages of Using Bitcoin for NFT Minting\n\nOne significant limitation is its restricted functionality compared to Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain wasn\u2019t initially designed for smart contracts. This barred it from having complex capabilities to build smart contracts and, consequently, NFTs.\n\nAnother concerning issue is Bitcoin\u2019s slower block time. Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain take longer to process and confirm compared to Ethereum. Such delays can frustrate both buyers and sellers waiting for their tokens.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin still trails Ethereum in terms of developer support. Ethereum boasts a larger developer community, providing a wealth of tools and resources for creating and deploying smart contracts. Bitcoin\u2019s lack of builders can make it challenging for creators to find necessary resources for NFT creation.\n\nDid you know that Bitcoin supports smart contracts?\n\n\n\nLedger Academy dives into what they are, how they work, and what you can do with them: https://t.co/No1QRYUQWp pic.twitter.com/fwN8ylKt3b \u2014 Ledger (@Ledger) January 8, 2024\n\nThe emergence of Bitcoin as an alternative platform for minting NFTs shows there\u2019s a broader shift towards exploring diverse blockchain ecosystems and milking the unique features and advantages they offer. Although Ethereum remains the dominant force in the NFT space, Bitcoin\u2019s brand recognition, security, and scalability present enticing reasons for creators to consider minting NFTs on its blockchain.\n\nBut the listed challenges such as limited smart contract functionality and a less mature ecosystem shows that builders should evaluate closely when choosing between Ethereum and Bitcoin for NFT minting.\n\nUltimately, the decision rests on the specific preferences, and objectives of creators, as they navigate their project.\n\nAuthor: Adeniyi Makinde\n\n#NFTs #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Blockchain #Crypto #DigitalAssets"

        "title": "Cardano (ADA) Secures Crucial Breakthrough, Ethereum (ETH) Breaks New High, Solana (SOL) on Verge of Important Price Test - U.Today",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardano has surged past the 50-day EMA, a technical indicator often used by traders to gauge the intermediate trend direction of an asset. The 50 EMA breakthrough signals strong bullish sentiment, as ADA's price climbs to test newer highs, which is a promising sign for investors seeking growth opportunities.\n\nThe current support level for ADA is established at around $0.50, which recently acted as a strong bounce point for the price. This level will be crucial for Cardano to maintain its bullish stance. Should the price remain above this support, it could pave the way for ADA to target the next resistance level at approximately $0.60.\n\nIf ADA continues its upward momentum and consistently closes above the 50 EMA, we could witness a further increase in buying pressure. This could lead to a new resistance test and potentially bring ADA to higher price points, eyeing the significant $0.65 mark as the next major target for bulls.\n\nConversely, should Cardano's price fall back below the 50 EMA, it may enter a consolidation phase or even a retracement. In this price drop scenario, the asset would likely find its first technical and psychological support level at $0.50. A breach below this could trigger sell-offs, leading to a retest of lower support levels, possibly around $0.48.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's surprising return\n\nEthereum has achieved a new high in its valuation. The digital currency has seen its value surge, crossing a critical threshold that could indicate further upward momentum.\n\nEthereum's recent breakthrough above the $2,600 mark signals a robust upward trend. This level previously served as a significant resistance, capping the asset's price during the previous cycle. With this level now surpassed, it sets a new local high for the asset, suggesting that the price may continue to rise as market confidence grows.\n\nThe support level for Ethereum is currently at around $2,500, which aligns with the moving averages that have historically acted as dynamic support during retracements. A sustained position above this level could reinforce the bullish sentiment and support the thesis of continued growth.\n\nOn the growth front, the continued rally could be fueled by the increased adoption and utility of ERC404 tokens, which combine the liquidity of ERC20 tokens with the uniqueness of ERC721 tokens. The high network fees on Ethereum also point to significant network utilization, hinting at robust on-chain activity that could support the asset's price.\n\nHowever, should a price drop scenario occur, a retest of the $2,500 support level is likely. If this support fails to hold, Ethereum could face a sharper decline toward the next significant support area, potentially around the $2,400 level, as traders may start to take profits, and momentum could slow down.\n\nSolana weaker than expected\n\nSolana is currently at a crucial juncture, testing the upper bounds of its established price channel. The asset has shown resilience and consistent performance over the past few weeks, leading to a critical moment that may define its trajectory in the short to medium term.\n\nSolana is trading around the $113.8 mark, approaching the upper resistance line of its price channel, which is approximately at the $115-$117 zone. This resistance level is particularly significant as it has previously acted as a strong point of rejection, prompting price pullbacks.\n\nOn the support side, Solana finds its immediate cushion around the $100 mark, which aligns with the 50-day EMA. This level has historically provided a bounce back zone for the price, indicating strong buying interest.\n\nShould Solana successfully break through the upper resistance level of the channel, the next probable target for growth is the $125-$130 range. This would establish a new higher high, potentially inviting more investors to the market and possibly initiating a new rally."

        "content": "ETH seems unstoppable. However, it had a helping hand from Bitcoin. In the following, we take a look at a few technical indicators that might provide some insights into why the Ethereum price is up today.\n\nKey Support levels: $2,500\n\nKey Resistance levels: $3,000\n\n1. Buyer Took Control of the Price\n\nEthereum is up in double digits this week and appears to be just heating up. Buyers are coming in strong, and they have already taken the price above $2,700 at the time of this post. The breakout at $2,500 started this rally and coincided with Bitcoin breaking above $50K.\n\n2. The Most Important Target Right Now\n\nEthereum\u2019s biggest target is $3,000 if this rally continues. This is a key psychological level that may awaken sellers once hit. Until now, sellers have been absent and unable to stop this buy momentum.\n\n3. Bitcoin Leads the Charge, Ethereum Follows\n\nThis rally is being driven by Bitcoin\u2019s spectacular performance in the past three days. Ethereum was quick to follow and managed to keep the same pace. This is a welcomed development as it brings enthusiasm across the whole spectrum of the market.\n\nMoreover, the recent bullish cross on the 3-day MACD confirms that ETH buyers may only be starting to show their strength, as shown below."

        "content": "Genesis Global has been approved by the bankruptcy court to sell around 35 million shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with an estimated value of $1.3 billion. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane made the decision during a court hearing held in White Plains, New York.\n\nThis approval authorizes Genesis to monetize its holdings of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust.\n\nGenesis to Sell its GBTC Shares\n\nIn addition to the $1.3 billion in GBTC shares, Genesis intends to sell over 11 million shares in two Grayscale Ethereum Trusts, with a combined value exceeding $200 million, as detailed in a court filing dated February 2.\n\nThis will result in a total of approximately $1.6 billion shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) combined.\n\nHowever, Genesis\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, attempted to delay the proposed sale until after the bankruptcy court decides on the subsidiary\u2019s debt repayment plan, which is scheduled for later this month. DCG expressed concerns that premature Grayscale share sales could depress prices, minimizing potential recoveries for Genesis creditors.\n\nJeffrey Saferstein, representing DCG, also emphasized the need for careful consideration to avoid the rapid unloading of shares. Additionally, DCG sought the right to seek input on selling Grayscale shares.\n\nDespite these objections, Judge Sean Lane ruled in favor of Genesis, asserting the company\u2019s right to determine the strategic sale of its assets. He emphasized that the sales would be conducted over time with the assistance of a broker to prevent any rapid unloading of shares, which could adversely affect prices.\n\nLane justified his decision by highlighting the \u201cconsiderable expertise\u201d of Genesis and its creditors in crypto, suggesting that they are well-equipped to maximize the value of the Grayscale shares.\n\nSEC and NY Attorney General Settlement\n\nMeanwhile, Genesis is moving forward with its liquidation plan, which entails shutting down the company and repaying customers in cash or cryptocurrency, depending on the nature of their deposits.\n\nThe company has reached settlements with the U.S. SEC and New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this month, resolving their objections to its bankruptcy plan.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlements, the SEC will be paid a $21 million fine if Genesis has any surplus funds after repaying customers. Furthermore, any funds recovered from the bankruptcy proceedings will be used by the New York Attorney General to assist creditors allegedly defrauded by Genesis."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could extend gains by 5% to $55,000 as BTC bulls hold their breath.\n\nEthereum price could leap 7% to $3,000 if ETH bulls keep their profit appetite in check.\n\nRipple price garners strength for an 11% move to $0.6000, levels last tested on January 12.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is pumping hard, with altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) following in line. The apex cryptocurrency continues to recover some of the ground lost during the past years.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price posts a new range high as Gensler details economic difference between BTC and the US Dollar\n\nBitcoin eyes $55,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price could take $55,000 soon, a 5% climb above current levels that does not seem so far right now. With strong technical indicators behind it, BTC is confronting resistance at the upper boundary of the ascending channel.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains northbound despite BTC being overbought, suggesting rising momentum that could send Bitcoin price higher. The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are also flashing green with large volumes in positive territory, showing a strong bullish presence in the BTC market. This is accentuated by the MACD moving higher above its signal line (orange band).\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, considering BTC is overbought, investors should not be surprised if a pullback happens, which could send Bitcoin price below the midline of the channel and into the supply zone (turned bullish breaker) between $44,300 and $46,760. A break and close below the $45,554 midline would confirm a continuation of the fall.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price $50,000 milestone short-lived as US CPI inflation signals persistent inflationary pressure\n\nEthereum price could leap to $3,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) price\u2019s $3,000 target is now within reach as ETH bulls keep their profit appetite in check. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token has breached resistance due to the midline of the channel with the potential for a 7% climb to the forecasted target.\n\nThe MACD and AO both show a strong bullish grip, while the RSI hints at rising momentum, which could ferry Ethereum price to the psychological level, last tested on April 26, 2022.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nLike BTC, however, ETH is also overbought, with the RSI above 70. With this, a correction is likely, with Ethereum price likely to descend 6.5% to $2,600 or in a dire case, revisit the $2,500 level. Such a move would denote a 10% drop below current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Classic price coils up for a breakout with $30 in the cards for ETC\n\nXRP bulls are back in the game\n\nRipple (XRP) price has sustained a recovery since early February, showing that XRP bulls are back in the game. With Bitcoin showing directional bias, altcoins are following and the remittance token is not far behind.\n\nWith the RSI above 50, coupled with a bullish effort seen in the green histogram bars of both the MACD and AO, Ripple price could extend the gains 11% to retake the $0.6000 psychological level.\n\nRipple price is sitting in the upper half of the Bollinger Bands, between the centerline and the upper band at $0.5196 and $0.5428, respectively. This accentuates the bullish thesis.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit booking could cut the rally short, sending XRP price below the midline of the channel. In a dire case, the altcoin could descend to the $0.4734 support floor, levels last seen on October 12.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple unveils plans for crypto custody while XRP price trades sideways"

        "content": "Thu 15 Feb 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nIn the particularly booming crypto market landscape lately, making a relevant choice between positioning on Bitcoin or Ethereum can be quite the dilemma. These two crypto ecosystems are the leaders of the crypto market. But they are distinctly different in terms of their functionalities and advantages. Understanding this divergence can be crucial for your crypto investment choices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the safest crypto investment over Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is often nicknamed the \u201cdigital gold\u201d due to its longevity and its increasing value over time. It is now widely regarded as a store of value and a hedge against often rampant inflation.\n\nMoreover, its simplicity and history make it an appealing choice for cautious, or even wary, investors. On this point, it stands out significantly from Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum firm.\n\nThe latter offers a decentralized platform that allows the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just limited to being a simple cryptocurrency.\n\nThanks to its flexibility, this platform paves the way to new prospects in various sectors such as finance and logistics, among others. This leads some to say that Ethereum represents decentralized innovation where Bitcoin is a safe investment choice. However, this doesn\u2019t always settle the question of choosing between these two crypto platforms.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum: how to make the choice?\n\nThe choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum mainly depends on your investment goals and your risk tolerance as an investor. Generally, Bitcoin is a good option if you\u2019re looking to preserve value, due to its stability and reputation as a safe asset.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are looking for growth opportunities, Ethereum might be particularly attractive because of its potential for innovation and its diversity of applications. This characteristic makes it an undisputed solution in terms of application development, due to its structure that\u2019s especially suitable for deploying dApps in a relevant way.\n\nEither way, these two crypto platforms share one common factor. As with the majority of cryptocurrencies, they are subject to high volatility and face uncertain regulations in many regions around the world. Even though Bitcoin features a more established technology while Ethereum is constantly evolving with regular updates.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Bitcoin and Ethereum will depend on your investor profile and your long-term goals. Hence the need to do your own research beforehand to take into account your particularities in terms of crypto investment.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

The token distribution aims to decentralize the network and empower community governance.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation plans to airdrop 728 million STRK tokens to over 1.3 million eligible Ethereum wallets that interact. They will have until June 20 to claim the tokens.\n\nThe Starknet Provisions Program is designed for a broad distribution of STRK to those who\u2019ve substantially contributed to Starknet.\n\n\n\nHere are a few relevant details:\n\n\n\n\u27281.3 million addresses.\n\n\n\n\u272850% of the token distributed to Starknet users.\n\n\n\n\u2728Ethereum stakers until the Merge,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mANrSYHeG9 \u2014 Starknet \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@Starknet) February 14, 2024\n\nStarknet leverages zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable fast and low-cost transactions while ensuring validity on the Ethereum mainnet. The network boasts Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, meaning dApps can deploy on Starknet using Cairo or Solidity code. Developers gain increased speed at lower costs.\n\nAs Starknet decentralizes with its token, the community can contribute more directly to governance decisions. Network participants also gain opportunities to help secure layer 2 through currently developing staking mechanisms.\n\nThe upcoming airdrop distribution aims to encourage broader engagement and kickstart a robust token economy. With Starknet processing over 50% of all layer-2 transactions, the launch of STRK may mark a significant milestone as ZK-rollups continue gaining market share.\n\nStarknet\u2019s combination of scalability, security, and usability presents a promising layer-2 solution amidst Ethereum\u2019s ongoing challenges with congestion and fees. The network hopes wider access to STRK will help further its capabilities and adoption."

According to Jules Urbach, the project\u2019s founder, the move greatly enhanced the utility of the protocol.\n\nSays Urbach,\n\n\u201cMoving Render\u2019s core infrastructure to Solana is a watershed moment that unlocks major new capabilities like real-time streaming and dynamic NFTs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Coinbase, it will be supporting both the Solana and Ethereum versions of the asset, noting that the tokens have slightly different names across blockchains.\n\n\u201cCoinbase will support trading of the Render token on both Ethereum and Solana networks. Render on the Ethereum network will retain the ticker RNDR while Render on Solana will have the ticker RENDER and will be named Render (Solana) on our trading platform.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gaming community, as well as Ethereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB) whales, are now directing their attention towards novel cryptocurrencies.\n\nDeeStream (DST) emerged as a blockchain project poised to revolutionize the live streaming industry. They perceive it as having the potential to experience a significant surge in value. This article delves into the reasons behind this growing interest and exploration of DeeStream (DST).\n\nSupporters of DeeStream (DST) can take part in pre-sale and buy tokens here .\n\nEthereum (ETH) to continue a bullish run?\n\nEthereum (ETH) recently concluded a bullish rally, experiencing an approximately 11% surge from $2361 to $2631 over the past week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis rally has contributed to Ethereum's notable performance, further evidenced by a substantial increase in trading volume, nearly doubling recently. The surge in volume signals investor confidence in the sustainability of this bullish trend.\n\nBinance (BNB) facing regulatory challenges\n\nDespite a modest over 6% increase in the past month, with prices rising from $303.94 to $323.22, Binance Coin (BNB) appears disconnected from the ongoing crypto rally, reflected in its relatively low uptick in trading volume compared to Ethereum (ETH). This divergence suggests that Binance\u2019s (BNB) gains may not be attributed to the broader market rally.\n\nThese developments occur against the backdrop of Binance (BNB) facing regulatory challenges and the recent criminal sentencing of its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The impact of these events is palpable in the market, as evidenced by Binance's (BNB) recent displacement from its market capitalization position by Solana (SOL).\n\nDeeStream (DST) welcomes new supporters\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Binance (BNB) whales are turning their attention towards the presale of DeeStream (DST), a novel decentralized streaming platform poised to disrupt the industry. Unlike centralized platforms like Kick and Twitch, DeeStream (DST) offers a decentralized model that empowers token holders through its governance system. As the live-streaming market is projected to soar to a valuation of $247 billion by 2027, DeeStream (DST) holds a significant first-mover advantage in this burgeoning sector.\n\nStreamers can seamlessly join the platform by completing a straightforward registration process and sharing their channel link with fans. In addition to earning revenue through Dee gifts, subscriptions, and packages, streamers benefit from fan engagement, while fans can participate in reward programs and earn cryptocurrency by completing tasks and reaching milestones. Moreover, the platform offers a swap service enabling users to exchange various cryptocurrencies with zero commission charges, facilitating seamless transactions globally.\n\nInvestors keen on participating in the presale , currently underway for just $0.035."

        "title": "XRP Army Applauds: SEC Nears End Of 'ETH Gate' Investigation - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly concluding its investigation into allegations of conflict of interest within its ranks, particularly concerning the regulation of Ethereum (ETH). The investigation, dubbed \u2018ETH Gate,\u2019 has garnered widespread attention, especially from the XRP community, which has long criticized the SEC\u2019s approach to crypto regulation.\n\nETH Gate Investigation In \u2018Final Stages\u2019\n\nTristan Leavitt, President of the government watchdog group Empower Oversight, shared critical updates on X (formerly Twitter) regarding the SEC\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) nearing the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of its inquiry. This investigation was initiated following Empower Oversight\u2019s referral to the OIG in May 2022, highlighting potential financial conflicts of interest by SEC officials in cryptocurrency-related decisions.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 The SEC has disclosed to @EMPOWR_us that the SEC OIG is in the \"final stages\" of an investigation into the cryptocurrency-related financial conflicts of interest Empower referred to the OIG in May 2022. https://t.co/IuYfNAsYXb\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Tristan Leavitt (@tristanleavitt) February 15, 2024\n\nA focal point of controversy involves William Hinman, former Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance, who, despite financial ties to the law firm Simpson Thacher\u2014a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance\u2014played a pivotal role in guiding the SEC\u2019s stance on cryptocurrencies. Hinman\u2019s 2018 declaration that Ether was not considered a security by the SEC raised eyebrows, given his undisclosed financial interest and the subsequent rise in Ether\u2019s value.\n\nEmpower Oversight\u2019s FOIA efforts unveiled that Hinman had consulted with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin of Consensys before his infamous \u201cHinman speech,\u201d despite guidelines to avoid such engagements. \u201cSimpson Thacher is a member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Its cryptocurrency, Ether, is a competitor with others like Bitcoin and Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP. So Hinman clearly shouldn\u2019t have been helping guide the SEC\u2019s enforcement decisions on cryptocurrencies,\u201d Leavitt highlighted.\n\nThe president of the government watchdog also expressed his combativeness and declared that Empower is ready to sue the SEC if it doesn\u2019t begin producing the documents by February 23. \u201cThe American people deserve transparency. The silver lining is that now we know one reason for the stonewalling [\u2026] However, whether the OIG report thoroughly addresses all the issues we raised remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nOn the implication for a potential spot Ethereum ETF, Leavitt answered, \u201cUnclear. We don\u2019t know the scope of their investigation yet\u2026 but we are in the process of finding out.\u201d\n\nXRP Army Reacts\n\nThe issue has gained considerable attention in the documentary \u201cXRP Unleashed\u201d by Fruition Films, where legal expert John E. Deaton criticized the scenario as \u201cregulatory capture 101.\u201d Reflecting on the documentary\u2019s insights, Deaton emphasized today:\n\nWe must have our ethics\u2019 rules followed, and when they\u2019re not, they must be enforced. America is at its greatest when we have a level playing field and we allow the best technologies and innovations to compete fairly. And we must ALWAYS stand up against gross government overreach.\n\nThe XRP community\u2019s reaction has been one of cautious optimism. Influential XRP influencer Mr. Intuitive (@BlackberryXRP) remarked, \u201cLast week: ETHgate is dead nothing will happen. This week: Investigation results coming soon.\u201d This sentiment underscores the shifting perceptions around the investigation\u2019s impact and growing attention.\n\nSteven Nerayoff, known as \u201cETH whistleblower\u201d who is currently preparing a fraud lawsuit against Ethereum\u2019s founders, echoed a defiant tone: \u201cI keep saying they will NOT bury this & we will expose them. I beat the SEC, DOJ, FBI & more. Unprecedented. I never doubted I\u2019d win. Why? I never let them get into my head & I exposed their weaknesses. Don\u2019t underestimate them or think they\u2019re invincible. They\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nAs the SEC nears the conclusion of its \u2018ETH Gate\u2019 investigation, the crypto community remains vigilant, hopeful for outcomes that could foster greater transparency, ethics, and fairness in the regulatory landscape. The final report by the OIG is eagerly anticipated, with potential far-reaching effects on the future of crypto regulation and enforcement.\n\nAt press time, XRP traded at $0.56954.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Smog, a new Solana meme coin prioritising fairness and community, offers a fair launch and large airdrops. It strategically expands by launching on Ethereum via Wormhole, aiming for 100x growth with staking rewards and an ambitious roadmap targeting mass adoption.\n\nSmog, a rising meme coin on Solana, aims to prioritise fairness and community engagement. Its fair launch model removes presales, ensuring everyone has a shot at acquiring $SMOG tokens.\n\nSmog also embraces a community-centric approach, allocating a large portion of tokens to airdrops and rewards, as evidenced by its impressive airdrop participation.\n\nFurthermore, Smog strategically positions itself to capitalise on the meme coin trend. It launched on Solana\u2019s efficient blockchain and further expanded its reach by entering the Ethereum ecosystem via Wormhole, tapping into its vast user base and liquidity.\n\nBy avoiding presales and focusing on airdrops, Smog fosters a strong community foundation, aiming to attract over 10,000 \u201cLoyal Chosen\u201d holders for long-term sustainability.\n\nBelow is a detailed guide explaining how to buy Smog:\n\nStep 1: Setting Up Your Wallet\n\nFirstly, ensure you have a digital wallet compatible with Solana. Popular options include Phantom and Trust Wallet, which offer both mobile apps and browser extensions for convenient access. Additionally, for Ethereum users, MetaMask serves as a compatible wallet to purchase $SMOG, along with ETH or USDT.\n\nStep 2: Purchasing Crypto\n\nTo acquire Smog tokens ($SMOG), you\u2019ll need cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, USDT, USDC, or BONK. These can be obtained from major exchanges and then transferred to your wallet. Alternatively, some wallets offer the option to purchase these cryptocurrencies directly through third-party providers, though be cautious of associated fees.\n\nStep 3: Connecting Your Wallet\n\nVisit Smog\u2019s official website and locate the \u201cBUY SMOG\u201d button on the buying widget or the top right corner of the homepage. Clicking this button will redirect you to Birdeye, a trusted crypto data aggregation platform. Here, you\u2019ll find a Jupiter-powered widget enabling you to swap your selected cryptocurrency for Smog tokens. Simply click on the widget\u2019s \u2018Connect Wallet\u2019 button and choose the wallet set up in the previous steps.\n\nUsers can also go to Jupiter decks and connect a Phantom wallet or other Solana-compatible wallets.\n\nStep 4: Buying and Holding $SMOG\n\nOnce your wallet is connected and you possess the required cryptocurrencies (SOL, USDT, BONK, etc.), you can exchange them for Smog tokens. The system will automatically track your airdrop points, contributing to your rewards as $SMOG launches on the Solana network.\n\nStep 5: Signing Up for the Airdrop\n\nFor additional engagement and rewards, consider signing up for the $SMOG airdrop on Zealy.io. Completing various community tasks earns you points, which will be tallied and updated a few weeks post-launch, enhancing your airdrop rewards and involvement within the Smog community.\n\nWhat is Smog?\n\nSmog is a trending meme crypto on the Solana blockchain that follows the footsteps of predecessors like Bonk, Myro and Dogwifhat, which have seen massive success in recent months.\n\nThe launch of Smog Token was nothing short of spectacular, propelling its market capitalisation to a staggering $37 million within the opening phase and driving a price increase of +134%.\n\nThis success was fuelled by the response to the SMOG airdrop campaign, which saw over 10,000 tasks completed.\n\nBUY $SMOG NOW WITH ETH, SOL, USDT, USDC, or BONK\n\nThe Smog development team continues to make waves with exciting multi-chain developments. The latest announcement was the $SMOG token launch on Ethereum, leveraging Wormhole and PortalBridge.com to facilitate cross-chain compatibility. This move aims to broaden Smog\u2019s reach and accessibility, tapping into Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem with over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL).\n\nThe multi-chain bridge will introduce a SMOG ETH LP, making it easier for new users to acquire $SMOG tokens and further driving price growth. Additionally, a new $SMOG staking platform is set to launch, offering attractive fixed APY yields of up to 42.0% to incentivise token holding.\n\nWith a base lock-up period of 3 months, both OTC and DEX-purchased SMOG tokens can be staked, providing users with additional rewards and reducing selling pressure.\n\nSmog Tokenomics\n\nSmog employs a strategic framework for dispersing $SMOG tokens, aiming to fulfil its objectives within the Solana ecosystem. This allocation of total supply serves to bolster the project\u2019s expansion, foster community involvement, and enhance market liquidity.\n\nThe $SMOG token grants holders access to \u2018The Dragon\u2019s Court,\u2019 a professional cryptocurrency community dedicated to unlocking endless \u2018virality\u2019.\n\nRoadmap\n\nSmog\u2019s roadmap unfolds in three phases:\n\nPhase 1: Building the Base\n\nThis phase focuses on setting the stage with airdrop research, staking tools, token deployment, and engaging the community through dragon-themed challenges. This builds pre-launch interest and fosters early adopter unity.\n\nPhase 2: Fair Launch & Execution\n\nThe focus shifts to executing Smog\u2019s game plan, including a fair launch guaranteeing equal access for all participants.\n\nPhase 3: Hypergrowth & Meme Coin Mastery\n\nThis ambitious phase aims for explosive growth with continuous airdrops, targeting over 100,000 token holders. Community engagement takes centre stage through \u201cSocial Mastery,\u201d while Smog strives to become the reigning \u201cSol King of all meme coins.\u201d\n\nWhy Buy $SMOG?\n\nSmog\u2019s allure lies in its potential for explosive growth. As the crypto market recovers, many seek the next breakout star. Smog\u2019s bold ambitions, riding the meme coin wave, could attract both individual and institutional investors.\n\nBUY AND STAKE $SMOG FOR 10% DISCOUNT\n\nMore than just a fun meme coin, Smog boasts strategic tokenomics and a community-driven approach. Its roadmap charts a clear course for development, prioritizing engagement, market reach, and long-term stability \u2013 a compelling package for potential investors.\n\nAccess the Smog community on X, Discord and Telegram to stay tuned with the latest project updates and news."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has initiated the Academic Grants Round for the year 2024. The purpose of this program is to encourage and support research activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nIn the previous funding round which was in 2023, the Foundation was successful, funding 43 projects from 20 different countries.\n\nThe foundation garnered an impressive 250 applications, signaling a huge worldwide interest for Ethereum research.\n\nLeveraging this momentum, the foundation extends its invitation to an even broader array of researchers and institutions from across the globe to partake in this grants round.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization that supports the development and growth of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform.\n\nEstablished in 2014, the foundation is not a company or a traditional non-profit, but rather a coordinating force that fosters the Ethereum ecosystem without controlling it.\n\nThe EF was initially funded by an online public crowd sale in 2014, where participants bought Ether (ETH) with Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s initiatives include the Ecosystem Support Program, which provides both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the Ethereum community.\n\nThe foundation also organizes the annual Devcon conference for Ethereum developers, researchers, thinkers, and makers.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Foundation Fellowship Program aims to address gaps in representation across cultures, nationalities, and economic classes.\n\nAs of April 2023, the Ethereum Foundation owns approximately 0.297% of the total Ether supply, which is approximately 350,000 ETH. The foundation also owns $300 million in non-crypto assets, mainly held in fiat currencies.\n\nIt is led by the leadership of an executive board consisting of Aya Miyaguchi, Vitalik Buterin, and Patrick Storchenegger.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, the total funds allocated for the initiative are $1 million. While the application is open, the deadline is set for 23:59 UTC on March 4th, 2024. Furthermore, it expresses particular interest in a diverse range of domains, encompassing applied and theoretical cryptography, economics, game theory, security, consensus protocols, formal verification, peer-to-peer networking, society and regulation, and hardware.\n\nOther details provided include that applications must be in English and submitted in PDF format. Proposals should comprise a detailed description, budget, and timeline for the proposed scope of work. An applicant profile, along with a public repository or link to published work, is required. Additionally, projects must produce formal academic research. Research output must be open-access with a free and permissive license.\n\nRestricted projects include anything illegal in the local jurisdiction, financial products and services (trading platforms, investment products, stablecoins, lending or betting platforms), art or social impact projects not aligned with this round\u2019s scope, projects seeking retroactive funding, and those planning token launches or public funding rounds.\n\nFunding decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the impact of the proposed research, the research team\u2019s experience, and the clarity of the proposal."

Its market value exceeded $1 trillion, marking a significant achievement not witnessed since November 2021. A firm close above $52,700 is expected to open the door for a potential climb to $60,000 and beyond. If this trend persists, Bitcoin is likely to surpass its previous all-time high of $69,000 very soon.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cBitcoin hits $52.5k as any doubts that bears had for a return from the $50k mark were shattered because of significant buying interest from institutional investors. Blackrock alone now holds more than 100,000 BTC. The next resistance for BTC is however not very far away and a small retracement can be expected around the $53k mark. ETH (+6%) on the other hand also broke past $2.8k as it went back to May 2022 levels. Ethereum is currently in high demand from staking and re-staking derivatives in the market. If ETH and BTC do not see a heavy correction, an altcoin season might be on the cards as we approach the bitcoin halving in April.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin surged to $52,000, reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap after 26 months, hinting at further gains. Despite a Tuesday dip below $50,000 on U.S. inflation data, BTC bounced back. The rally pushed BTC's market value past $1 trillion for the first time since Dec. 2021, rising 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 6%, while Ethereum (ETH) reached $2,750, its highest since May 2022. Bullish sentiment persists, targeting $75,000, fueled by robust inflows into U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs, including BlackRock's IBIT. Analysts foresee BTC's uptrend with a key support level of $46,000 but caution about slowing momentum.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's rally above $50,000 this week saw most long-term holders profit, despite the recent market decline following the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Glassnode's analysis suggests that this decline was a typical bull market correction. Long-term holders are selling their coins, partly due to the ETF craze and the outflow of Bitcoin Trust in the grayscale. However, newer bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity and others have attracted over $10 billion, offsetting the selling pressure. With less than 13% of total supply still in the red and strong trading volumes for new ETFs, the worst of Grayscale's selloff may be behind us.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe Total Crypto Market has increased by 5% from the last day to $1.95 trillion, fueled by a new Bitcoin all-time high (ATH) again for this year. The market optimism around Bitcoin halving continues as Bitcoin has regained a $1 trillion market cap above $52,000 and is just 30% away from ATH. One event investors should pay close attention to is the recent Genesis court approval to redeem its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings valued at $1.3 billion and potential impacts on the cryptocurrency market.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cThe crypto market continues to rise, with Bitcoin and Ethereum hitting their highest points of the year. This growth is fueled by increased investments in Bitcoin spot ETFs and positive sentiment about the upcoming halving event. For Bitcoin to keep climbing, it needs to close above $52,000. Likewise, Ethereum aims to break the $2,900 barrier on its way to $3,300. Alts have also started showing strength, tokens like STX and IMX have surged by over 25% in just a few days.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to remain stable within the $49,000 range early Tuesday. Other top coins, including the likes of \u2014 Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw minor losses across the board. The PYTH token emerged as the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour jump of over 15 percent.

Despite a dip to $48,000, it has bounced back to $49,500, showcasing a bullish trend. If Bitcoin maintains levels above $49,000 this week, the potential for growth to $50,000 and beyond is likely; otherwise, a correction within the $46,000-$48,000 range might occur.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cAfter crossing $50k early yesterday for a brief period of time, BTC corrected for about 2.5% due to the US CPI data for January where CPI print came higher than expected. The January report showed 3.1% year-on-year inflation as compared to the expectation of 2.9% which directly had an impact on the chances of rate cuts in May. Market participants now see a 34% chance of a rate cut as compared to 51% before this data became public. Since $50k is a major psychological resistance, it would be interesting to see whether BTC corrects further down. On the other hand, as crypto fear and greed hit its highest levels since Nov 2021, we are seeing the crypto market rally. In altcoin news, SOL(-1.89%) briefly overtook BNB as the 4th largest crypto by market cap, with its market being in touching distance of $50 billion. If BTC continues the rally or even starts consolidating near the current price levels, we could see great gains in fundamentally solid altcoins.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cOn Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $50,000 in response to a US inflation report that exceeded expectations, affecting projections for interest-rate cuts. The leading cryptocurrency faced a 2% downturn, sliding from an initial $50,000 to $48,700, rebounding to $49,600 afterward. In contrast, SOL exhibited increased resilience, achieving a gain of over 1%. Analysts urged vigilance concerning market optimism, highlighting that the inflation data hindered Bitcoin's rally shortly after surpassing the $50,000 threshold on Monday.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin fell below $49,000 after the release of stronger-than-expected US CPI data, dampening expectations of a rate cut. With US government bond yields and the rising dollar index, Bitcoin has faced selling pressure along with stocks and gold. However, the withdrawal may be short-lived. Spot inflows into Bitcoin ETFs remain strong, suggesting sustainable demand despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Additionally, with the upcoming supply halving and the continued influx of spot ETFs, bullish sentiment remains. Options data indicated rising investor optimism, while potential safe-haven demand amid concerns over US regional banks could further support bitcoin. Thus, declines are seen as buying opportunities, with a retest of the all-time highs at $69,000 likely in the near future.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe Crypto market experienced a slight correction as Bitcoin made a pull back to $49,000 level. The next few days could see a decrease in Bitcoin Dominance and the start of a bullish trend for Ethereum and Altcoins. At the same time the Bitcoin ETF inflows have continued to increase making the demand for Bitcoin 10x more than the supply coming from miners. We may witness a continuation of the bullish trend until the halving in April this year.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the last 24 hours, the release of US CPI data showing 3.1% versus the forecasted 2.9% caused BTC to drop by almost $2000 to the $48,000 level. However, it managed to recover slightly. This drop also impacted altcoins, which fell by more than 5%, with some recovering afterward. Additionally, NASDAQ experienced a decline of more than 1.5%. Technically, BTC saw a daily bearish candle close after eight consecutive days of green candle closes. While this isn't necessarily a sign of reversal yet, BTC needs to maintain its position above $49,000 and clear the $51,850 level. On the other hand, ETH/BTC bounced back from its support level, suggesting that we may see ETH outperforming BTC for the next few days.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

It serves its role as just a cryptocurrency, earning high esteem among crypto enthusiasts for its significant worth and the distinct investment opportunities it offers. Recently, Ethereum has gained spotlight following spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC. In 2023, while the US crypto market was focused on Bitcoin ETFs, Blackrock\u2019s proposal for an Ethereum-based ETF shifted the spotlight to Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. This shift, alongside a positive market trend and a crypto rally in late October, helped Ethereum\u2019s value surpass $2,000, a significant milestone it hadn\u2019t reached in months. Ethereum\u2019s rise was further triggered after the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, leading to a peak in Ethereum\u2019s value in nearly two years by January 12. Looking ahead, Ethereum is set for notable upgrades with the upcoming Deneb and Cancun updates. The Dencun upgrade is particularly significant, introducing proto-danksharding to improve network scalability, reduce gas fees for users, and enhance interoperability with other blockchains, paving the way for more efficient cross-chain interactions. Amid all these, our Ethereum price prediction aims to explore the future trend of ETH price with in-depth technical analysis to offer profitable investment opportunities. Looking for crypto with more potential than Ethereum? Explore our guide to the best crypto to buy now.\n\nEthereum And Its Use Cases\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015, revolutionized blockchain technology by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) beyond just supporting cryptocurrencies. It introduced its native coin, Ether (commonly referred to as Ethereum or ETH), which is used for transactions on the blockchain. [ccpw id=60480] can be traded, staked for blockchain contributions, and was initially part of a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, where complex computations added blocks to the blockchain. However, this system was environmentally costly, using more energy annually than Kazakhstan, and led to slow, congested transactions.\n\nAnd we finalized!\n\n\n\nHappy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 15, 2022\n\nTo address these issues, [ccpw id=60480] transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in 2020, allowing holders to add blocks based on their ETH holdings. This shift, known as The Merge, was completed on September 15, 2022, making the network more efficient and environmentally friendly.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Hype And Current Status\n\nCurrently, with 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs operational, the crypto community is speculating about the potential approval and timing of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, the situation is complex. The SEC has not clarified if ether qualifies as a security, a determination that could impede an ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nFurthermore, the SEC\u2019s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was contentious, narrowly passing with a one-vote margin, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s vote. Gensler emphasized that this approval does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin by the SEC and should not be interpreted as openness to approving crypto asset securities in general.\n\nReporting on the timeline for a potential $ETH ETF approval has turned up a plethora of different takes from ETF issuers, investment management firms and sources close to the @SECGov.\n\n\n\n\u2728One $BTC Spot ETF issuer with an ETH Spot ETF application says they\u2019re confident the\u2026 \u2014 Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 23, 2024\n\nThese factors, among others, have led to mixed opinions about the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved soon. While banks generally view such approval as improbable, crypto experts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook.\n\nProponents expecting a spot Ethereum ETF approval this year draw parallels to the recent approval process of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMatt Kunke, a research analyst at the crypto market making firm GSR, predicts a 75% chance of a spot Ethereum ETF approval in May. His optimism is based on Grayscale\u2019s Court of Appeals victory and the subsequent green light for Ethereum Futures ETF. He believes these developments indicate that a spot Ethereum ETF approval is imminent.\n\nKunke also noted that if the SEC rejects the current spot Ethereum ETF applications in May, an appeal is likely to follow. In such a scenario, he suggests that the SEC might choose the easier route of approval, while still maintaining a cautious approach towards other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe SEC has recently postponed Grayscale Investments\u2019 request to transform its Ethereum trust product (ETHE) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This decision came just a day after the SEC similarly deferred BlackRock\u2019s application for a comparable ETF proposal.\n\nMarket sentiment has shown a degree of optimism regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETF by May 23, the deadline set by the SEC for the Ark 21Shares application. However, according to JPMorgan (JPM), the likelihood of the SEC granting approval for the ETF by this date is estimated to be no higher than 50%.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Price History\n\n[ccpw id=60480] price history has seen significant fluctuations. Launching at around $2.77 in 2015, it surpassed $10 in 2016 but faced setbacks due to a hack. In 2017, it crossed $100 and briefly went over $1,000 in early 2018 during a crypto bubble, then stabilized around $300 for the next three years.\n\nIn early 2021, Ethereum\u2019s price surged, nearly reaching $4,000 in May. Despite a summer dip, it rebounded, partly driven by the NFT craze. [ccpw id=60480] hit a record high of $4,891.70 in November as [ccpw id=60415] also soared.\n\n2022 was challenging for crypto, with Ethereum nearly falling below $1,000 despite the successful completion of The Merge.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum saw a period of recovery, surpassing the $2,000 mark in April for the first time in almost a year. However, it experienced a downturn in early June, dropping to $1,624.14 by June 15. The market then rebounded, and following a decision that Ripple\u2019s XRP was not a security on exchanges, Ethereum peaked at $2,026.20 on July 14.\n\nBy December 9, Ethereum\u2019s value climbed to $2,401.76, the highest since May 2022. On December 13, it was trading around $2,180. The price peaked again at $2,445.02 on December 28, before closing the year at $2,281.47. However, Ethereum started this year on a bearish note as spot Bitcoin ETF approval triggered a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event in the market, plunging ETH price toward the $2,100 level.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Technical Analysis\n\nEther gained momentum after it surpassed the $2,400 resistance level, showcasing strong buying interest from investors. Over the last few hours, ETH price faced strong buying pressure near the $2,700 level and knocked the $2,830 level; however, it faced resistance from the bears. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,802, surging over 1.9% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nInvestors are currently attempting to hold the price beyond the $2,800 resistance, indicating a continuation of the upward trend. Should the buyers maintain the upward trend above immediate Fib channels, the ETH/USDT pair might surge to the key $3,000 mark. At this level, short-term traders could begin to take profits and trigger a correction.\n\nThe pressure is increasing on the bears. To plunge the bullish momentum, they must lower and keep the price under the EMA20 trend line. If successful, the pair could retreat to the $2,600 level and might prepare for a retest of the $2,400 level. However, this support zone will likely attract buyers to accumulate more ETH.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction By Blockchain Reporter\n\nYears Minimum ($) Average ($) Maximum ($) 2024 1,336.16 2,802.23 3,694.71 2025 4,724.31 4,851.80 5,044.96 2026 6,432.54 6,864.13 7,024.51 2027 8,436.93 8,610.28 9,225.42 2028 7,356.01 7,853.56 8,372.82 2029 10,476.50 11,116.55 11,267.95 2030 14,884.16 15,434.11 15,892.40 2031 21,468.24 21,708.27 23,002.47 2032 30,257.37 30,703.18 31,393.21 2033 41,282.84 42,125.08 42,202.84\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024\n\nIn 2024, the price of 1 Ethereum is expected to attain a minimum level of $1,336.16.

The technical indicators used by Coincodex suggest a current Bearish sentiment, with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a Neutral stance at 49. In the past 30 days, Ethereum has experienced 40% green days, showing a 5.25% price volatility.\n\nCoincodex\u2019s analysis currently advises against purchasing Ethereum. Their forecast, considering historical price trends of Ethereum and Bitcoin halving cycles, estimates the yearly low for Ethereum in 2025 to be around $2,161.48. However, they also predict that Ethereum\u2019s price could soar up to $6,389.27 in the following year.\n\nVanEck, a prominent global investment fund house, holds a bullish stance on Ethereum, viewing it as a \u201ctriple-point asset\u201d that serves as a capital asset, a consumer asset, and a store of value. VanEck believes that, under favorable conditions, Ethereum\u2019s market cap could surpass $2 trillion.\n\nBen Ritchie, the managing director of Digital Capital Management, forecasts that Ethereum could potentially end the year at around $2,500, provided positive developments continue.\n\nWell-known cryptocurrency blogs such as Gov Capital and Traders Union also share a bullish outlook on Ethereum. Gov Capital predicts Ethereum\u2019s value could reach $7,200 by 2025. Anton Kharitonov, an analyst at Traders Union, anticipates that Ethereum could be trading at about $6,196.08 by the end of 2025, with the potential to increase to $31,656.34 by 2030.\n\nIs Ethereum A Good Investment? When To Buy?\n\nDetermining Ethereum\u2019s future performance is challenging. The cryptocurrency has shown strong buying confidence, recovering well from the news of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. Additionally, Ethereum is progressing with new upgrades and there\u2019s rising speculation about a potential spot Ethereum ETF, which has positively influenced its price.\n\nHowever, the much-anticipated Merge, expected to significantly enhance Ethereum, did not have a substantial impact on its price. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also means that Ethereum\u2019s value could decrease at any moment. It\u2019s noteworthy that Bitcoin\u2019s value declined following the approval of its spot ETFs last week.\n\nConversely, the increasing amount of Ethereum being staked indicates that The Merge has been technically successful and well-received in the community. It is suggested to invest in ETH at a price of $1,800-$1,900 for a solid return in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum, renowned as a technologically advanced and established cryptocurrency, is poised to maintain its leading position in the altcoin market in the upcoming years, as indicated by the aforementioned Ethereum price prediction. Differing from Bitcoin, Ethereum functions as a utility token. While its price is significantly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s movements and broader macroeconomic factors, Ethereum\u2019s value is also affected by a variety of crypto-specific elements.\n\nAdditionally, the trends in cryptocurrency and equity markets typically exhibit parallel movements. However, over the past year, these markets have shown a divergence. For instance, numerous tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL) have reached all-time highs, while the cryptocurrency sector continues to experience a bear market.\n\nRecent improvements in macroeconomic conditions, like the slowdown in inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s pause on interest rate hikes, have not led to a corresponding positive impact on cryptocurrency prices, including Ethereum. This raises questions about the factors influencing the crypto market\u2019s reaction to these economic changes.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is a blockchain platform that introduced Ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency used for transactions on its network. Launched in 2015, Ethereum is notable for enabling decentralized applications (DApps) and transitioning to a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system.\n\nWhat are Ethereum ETFs and their current status? Ethereum ETFs are proposed exchange-traded funds based on Ethereum. The current status is uncertain, as the SEC has not yet approved any Ethereum ETFs, and their potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s value and the broader crypto market is a subject of speculation.\n\nWhat factors could influence Ethereum\u2019s price in the future? Ethereum\u2019s price could be influenced by various factors including market trends, technological upgrades like Deneb and Cancun, regulatory decisions, the outcome of Ethereum ETFs, and overall investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market."

        "content": "Ether price crossed $2,800 on February 15th for the first time since early 2022, nearing its historic peak above $4,900 reached in late 2021.\n\nThe recent rally has been driven by a confluence of factors \u2013 anticipation of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the US, increasing levels of staking participation locking up circulating supply, and overall positive market sentiment.\n\nTLDR\n\nEther (ETH) price breaks above $2,700 on Feb 15, 2024 for the first time since May 2022 as traders anticipate potential approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US\n\nSeveral major financial firms like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Ark Invest have filed for a spot ETH ETF which could significantly boost institutional demand\n\n25% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply is now locked in the ETH 2.0 staking contracts as investors deposit more ETH to earn staking rewards of ~4% per year\n\nOver 943,000 validators are now active on the Ethereum Beacon Chain as staking participation continues to increase, improving network security\n\nAnalysts predict ETH price could rapidly approach its all-time high around $5,000 if bullish momentum continues, with $3,500 as a key medium-term target\n\nSeveral major financial services firms like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock and Ark Invest have already secured regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2023.\n\nThey are now racing to launch the first spot ETH ETF, which would open the floodgates for trillions in institutional capital to invest directly into the asset.\n\nThe SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs helped propel BTC price over $50k this year. Market participants expect a similar impact on ETH prices if spot ETH ETFs get the green light.\n\nIn parallel, staking participation on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain continues to steadily rise. 25% of the total circulating supply of ETH is now locked up in staking deposits, reducing sell-side pressure.\n\nOver 943,000 validators are actively participating in the consensus process on Ethereum as it transitions to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake blockchain.\n\nValidators earn ~4% annual yield as rewards for their capital locked up as collateral, creating a passive income stream that has boosted participation.\n\nAs staking levels increase, so does the security of the chain making 51% attacks virtually impossible due to the cost associated with obtaining such a large chunk of ETH supply.\n\nETH\u2019s pivot to proof-of-stake is also environmentally sustainable, in line with institutional investors and funds growing focus on ESG mandates. This makes it likely the SEC greenlights spot Ether ETFs.\n\nWith consoldiation around the $2,800 levels, analysts say ETH looks poised to challenge its historic peak around $5,000 later in 2024.\n\nKey target levels on the way up are $3,500 which was the April 2022 top, and $4,200 which marked the pre-crypto winter peak in November 2022.\n\nContinued spikes in staking deposits locking up ETH supply, approval of spot ETH ETFs allowing new institutional capital inflows, as well as broader crypto bull run returning could be the perfect storm that sees Ether trade firmly into 5 digits for the first time ever."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Can it reach $10,000 in 2024? - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "The Ethereum price is currently moving up quickly in the slipstream of the Bitcoin price and has been able to surpass the $2,600 mark again in the last few days . With the recent increases, there is a chance that the Ethereum price can reach new all-time highs in the coming months. Can the Ethereum price even rise to $10,000 by the end of 2024? How has the Ethereum price moved in the last few weeks? The Ethereum price has risen significantly in the last few weeks. In mid-October, the Ethereum price was still at $1,600. Then the price rose extremely sharply at the end of 2023. In mid-January, Ethereum was able to break through the $2,600 mark.\n\nIn the last few weeks we saw a significant consolidation and the price fell back to the $2,200 mark. But another bull run over the last two weeks brought the Ethereum price back above $2,600. Can the ETH price rise consistently in the coming months? The year 2024 has so far been dominated by the crypto bull run. The Bitcoin price is rising massively in anticipation of the halving. Especially as Bitcoin prices continue to rise, the prices of altcoins could rise even more in percentage terms. While many coins are highly speculative, a rise in Ethereum is still the safest behind Bitcoin. Another point that could cause the Ethereum price to explode is a possible Ethereum ETF. However, many regulatory questions still need to be clarified. Whether the ETH price rises more strongly, equally or slightly weaker than the Bitcoin price, a rally in 2024 is likely. Can the ETH price rise to $10,000 at the end of 2024? The Ethereum price could well see a new all-time high in 2024. This is above the $4,800 mark. This puts us over 50% of the all-time high at the moment. The road to $5,000 might not be far."

        "title": "Ethereum at $3200 and New Crypto Pandoshi, Currently at $0.01, to Reach $1 in Q1, Expert Traders Say - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Ethereum has awoken from its slumber as analysts predict a surge to $3,200, driven by strong fundamentals of shrinking supply and rising demand. At the same time, the new crypto Pandoshi, currently priced at just $0.01, is poised to reach $1 in Q1 2024, according to expert traders.\n\nEthereum Fundamentals Fueling Next Leg Up\n\nOver 25% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is now locked in staking platforms, greatly reducing the amount available for trading or investing. This supply shock comes alongside a burning mechanism reducing ETH supply by 0.21% per year. Already, 357,148 ETH valued at $947 million has been burned since The Merge.\n\nAdditional bullish factors boosting demand include the upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs and the March deployment of EIP-4844, which will significantly lower layer-2 gas fees.\n\n\u201cThis is the most basic law of economics. If demand is increasing, and supply is decreasing, then the price has no choice but to pump,\u201d said one crypto analyst.\n\nWith strong technicals and fundamentals in place, analysts predict Ethereum breaking out above $3,200 in short order.\n\nPandoshi Targets $1 Price Level\n\nPandoshi has ignited interest in the crypto market at just $0.01 per token in its rapidly selling out presale. The deflationary cryptocurrency implements a buy and burn mechanism through its PandoshiSwap decentralized exchange and its prepaid crypto cards, Cardoshi. These platforms continuously raise demand for the PAMBO token while reducing the circulating supply.\n\nAt the core of Pandoshi lies the PandaChain proof-of-stake blockchain, optimized for fast, affordable transactions. PandaChain enables frictionless interoperability between ecosystem products, including the DEX, wallet, and crypto debit cards.\n\nFollowing the end of its presale, Pandoshi will list its native token, PAMBO, on two prominent centralized exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. These tier-one exchange listings deliver instant accessibility for both retail and institutions. The token will also be available for decentralized trading on Uniswap.\n\n\u201cGetting listed on Coinbase and Binance guarantees Pandoshi exposure to tens of millions of active traders,\u201d said industry analyst Thomas Wayne. \u201cConsidering its ecosystem and tokenomics, a dollar valuation is reasonable. Pandoshi at one cent is a lotto pick.\u201d\n\nWith Phase 5 presale nearly sold out, only 7% of the PAMBO token supply allocated to presale remains available. 1 billion of the 2 billion PAMBO tokens were made available for presale buyers at the start of the campaign.\n\nAs the maxim goes, the best projects are listed on the best exchanges. By targeting listings on Coinbase, Binance, and Uniswap, Pandoshi continues to gain credibility while offering almost unlimited growth potential at its current $0.01 price discovery phase.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith Ethereum fundamentals firmly in place to support a surge to $3,200, now is an opportune time for investors to gain exposure. In tandem, ultra-low priced Pandoshi presents asymmetric upside at just $0.01, with $1 in sight, according to expert analyst projections.\n\nThe dual opportunities in Ethereum and Pandoshi demonstrate crypto\u2019s wealth generating potential in 2023 and beyond.\n\nClick Here To Buy PAMBO Tokens\n\nExplore the following links for detailed information on Pandoshi (PAMBO):\n\nWebsite: https://pandoshi.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.pandoshi.com/\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.
