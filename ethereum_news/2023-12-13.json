        "title": "Ethereum Network Consumes 28x Less Energy Annually than American Express: Report - Bitcoinsensus",
        "content": "Demystifying Ethereum\u2019s Electricity Usage with Concrete Comparisons\n\nExplore Ethereum\u2019s electricity consumption through tangible comparisons, revealing its impact on daily life.\n\nFrom powering the University of Cambridge for 19 days to equating to 675 air conditioners, understand Ethereum\u2019s scale.\n\nGain unique perspectives by comparing Ethereum to businesses, buildings, and even the colossal task of exploring the universe in terms of energy demand.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nEthereum, a prominent player in the digital landscape, is generating considerable attention not just for its technological prowess but also for its annual electricity consumption. A recent report has shown that navigating through the labyrinth of electricity figures poses a challenge for many, prompting the need for a straightforward exploration of Ethereum\u2019s energy usage. The goal here is simple: break down complex data into tangible comparisons that resonate with a diverse audience.\n\nTangible Comparisons\n\nEthereum vs. University of Cambridge:\n\nIn the realm of academic energy needs, Ethereum\u2019s annual electricity consumption is no small feat. To put it into perspective, the power it consumes could fuel the entire University of Cambridge for 19 days. It\u2019s a numerical translation that underscores the scale of Ethereum\u2019s energy appetite.\n\nEthereum vs. Air Conditioners:\n\nThe sheer magnitude of Ethereum\u2019s electricity consumption becomes apparent when likened to a commonplace appliance\u2014the air conditioner. With the equivalent power usage of 675 air conditioners, Ethereum\u2019s impact on energy grids is more tangible than one might initially assume. Sources for this comparison include Khorram et al. (2020) and the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (2020).\n\nEthereum vs. English Households and Tesla Cybertruck:\n\nFor those more accustomed to household metrics, Ethereum\u2019s annual electricity consumption aligns with the energy needs of 1966 average English households. In the automotive realm, covering a distance of 17 million miles in a Tesla Cybertruck requires the same amount of energy. These comparisons, sourced from EV-Database.uk, serve as clear benchmarks for understanding Ethereum\u2019s energy footprint.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Climbs Over $2,200, Hitting Levels Last Seen 19 Months Ago\n\nSection 2: Putting Ethereum\u2019s Consumption into Perspective\n\nQuantitative Perspective:\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\u2019s electricity usage demands a quantitative lens. It\u2019s essential to approach these comparisons with precision, acknowledging their limitations. To avoid apples-to-oranges scenarios, Ethereum is benchmarked against businesses and buildings, deliberately excluding industrial and residential structures due to their vastly different consumption levels.\n\nUnique Comparisons\n\nEthereum vs. Companies (GWh):\n\nIn the realm of gigawatt-hours, Ethereum\u2019s power consumption aligns with companies. Quantifying it in this manner provides a tangible gauge for understanding the scale of Ethereum\u2019s energy demands compared to these corporate entities.\n\nEthereum vs. Buildings (GWh):\n\nBuildings, as significant consumers of energy, offer another benchmark for Ethereum\u2019s electricity usage. Comparing it in terms of gigawatt-hours sheds light on the scale of Ethereum\u2019s consumption compared to structures that shape our urban landscapes.\n\nEthereum vs. Exploring the Universe:\n\nTaking a departure from the conventional, a unique comparison emerges\u2014Ethereum\u2019s power demand compared to activities like exploring the universe. This unconventional benchmark adds a layer of perspective, urging us to consider Ethereum\u2019s energy footprint in the broader context of human endeavors.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Network Power Demand\n\nBlockchain Network Overview:\n\nZooming out from Ethereum, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the broader landscape of blockchain networks and their power demands. Evaluating power consumption involves more than just raw figures; it necessitates a nuanced understanding of consensus mechanisms and network size. These factors play a pivotal role in comprehending the ecological impact of blockchain technologies.\n\nStressing Consensus Mechanisms and Network Size:\n\nPower demand in the blockchain ecosystem isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all metric. Consensus mechanisms, whether proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, and the size of the network are critical variables. Larger, more decentralized networks tend to have a more substantial ecological footprint, making it imperative to consider these factors when assessing the environmental impact of blockchain technologies.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "An analysis of Ethereum\u2019s financial information has shown that an astronomical $2.5 billion worth of ETH has been burned since the Merge Event in September of 2022. Indeed, Ultrasound Money shows that the supply of Ethereum is at an 18-month low, currently standing at 309,663 ETH.\n\nThe development shows a clear contrast to the inflation that Ethereum had previously observed. Indeed, the asset has now shown a deflationary shift due to the 1,195,238 ETH that has been burned. Moreover, that permanent reduction in supply will have a long-term positive impact on the asset\u2019s value.\n\nSource: Investopedia\n\nAlso Read: Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin in 2024? VanEck Weighs In\n\nEthereum Supply Drops by 1 Million ETH Since Merge\n\nThroughout the entire history of the digital asset sector, Bitcoin has reigned supreme. However, the rising prominence of Ethereum has caused it to be the only true competitor within the space. Moreover, the landmark merge event had been a massive moment in the increased prominence of the asset. Now, the fruits of that development are starting to take shape.\n\nSpecifically, recent observation has shown that Ethereum is $2.5 billion worth of ETH burned since that merge event in 2022. Altogether, the event has caused a net decrease in overall supply. That decrease has still been present despite the issuance of $1.86 billion worth of the digital asset.\n\nSource: Bitcoinist\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Makes $78 Million Profit After Investing $11 Million\n\nCurrently, Ethereum\u2019s total supply is at its lowest point since that Merge event, with 120,211,380 ETH. Moreover, that supply equates to a market cap for the asset that is still north of $266 billion. Subsequently, it further reiterates the place Ethereum holds in the greater digital asset market.\n\nThe effects of that very Merge event are already being felt, but still have longstanding positives to be uncovered down the line. The decrease in supply will have a massive impact on the token\u2019s scarcity. Therefore, it will only grow in value overtime, and potentially ascend to previuoly unkown heights."

        "content": "Web3 digital infrastructure provider COTI announced plans to launch a layer-2 chain on the Ethereum network that will be focused on adding a privacy layer to its products and services.\n\nAccording to a statement seen by CryptoPotato, the new protocol, COTI V2, will use a cryptographic technology called Garbled Circuits to enhance privacy while ensuring high speed and scalability.\n\nCOTI Unveils Privacy L2 Network\n\nCOTI claims Garbled Circuits is ten times more efficient than the Zero-Knowledge protocol, a method used by several layer-2 blockchains on the Ethereum network. COTI\u2019s new protocol will utilize Ethereum\u2019s pre-existing liquidity and security while implementing robust privacy protection for the ecosystem.\n\nThe launch of COTI\u2019s new protocol is driven by the lack of privacy and confidentiality on all layers of the public blockchain. The digital infrastructure provider believes the current state of the blockchain ecosystem gives malicious actors enough room to operate and that only strong privacy-centric architecture can protect the Web3 community.\n\nBesides ensuring privacy protection, COTI intends to focus on building areas that are \u201cwoefully lacking\u201d in Web3. The protocol\u2019s first challenge would be resolving users\u2019 ability to use the blockchain in complete privacy. COTI V2 will implement cryptography, enabling users to execute transactions without exposing their payment histories, wallet values/addresses, or other sensitive information.\n\nDeveloping a Complaint Ecosystem\n\nCOTI believes that focusing on anonymity to create privacy causes regulatory issues, which is ineffective in developing a complaint ecosystem. The new protocol will ensure transparency while protecting information that could harm users and the growth of web3.\n\nShahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI, said: \u201cSensitive data transmitted as public information on a blockchain is a bug, not a feature. This isn\u2019t tolerated in legacy business systems, so why should it be tolerated on-chain? COTI V2 will solve for this, preventing sensitive data from being broadcast to competitors, partners, and clients.\u201d\n\nThe digital infrastructure firm has scheduled the COTI V2 devnet release for the second quarter of 2024, after which the testnet and mainnet launch will follow. The company expects the launch to unlock countless new use cases in the industry and, in turn, trigger an immediate surge in web3 development."

        "title": "Singapore licenses Ethereum-based exchange - DigFin",
        "content": "DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech, has received dual licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore that make it the first regulated exchange in the country facilitating real-world asset trading on public Ethereum.\n\nThat adds up to providing a digital-asset venue for both crypto and for tokenized real-world assets that settles transactions on a public, permissionless blockchain, rather than a closed, centralized ledger.\n\nThe move puts Singapore back in the race to foster regulated crypto marketplaces, sixteen months after Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission awarded its first comparable licenses.\n\nHenry Zhang, founder and CEO of DigiFT, says, \u201cOur marketplace is licensed and based on DeFi infrastructure.\u201d\n\nVersus Hong Kong peers\n\nDigiFT is similar to Hong Kong-based counterparts such as OSL and HashKey in that it is licensed and trading digital assets, from crypto to securities tokens. But the difference is DigiFT settles using Ethereum\u2019s mainnet, whereas the Hong Kong players must rely on centralized infrastructure. (HashKey is an investor in DigiFT.)\n\nHong Kong exchanges operate under existing securities laws, with an added layer under the city\u2019s anti-money laundering ordinance compliance checks, the VASP regime (for virtual-asset service provider).\n\nDigiFT has won two MAS licenses. The first is a Capital Market Services license, which lets it issue digital-asset tokens. The second, as a Recognized Market Operator, lets it facilitate trading of those tokens on a secondary market, as well as to accept payments in fiat money or crypto.\n\nThe company was founded in 2021 and spent eighteen months in the MAS sandbox. In that environment, it was able to list five tokens, four based on real-world assets and a fifth a crypto token for staking on Ethereum.\n\nHybrid model\n\nZhang says the condition for getting a full commercial license was to prove DigiFT could place KYC and AML checks on top, which meant putting a degree of centralized controls on top of the underlying decentralized layer-one.\n\nBecause activity on Ethereum is peer-to-peer, Zhang says the setup encourages users to either self-custody or custody with third parties. Hong Kong\u2019s VASP regime mandates exchanges provide custody for customer assets.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet how much of a difference this will make, as Hong Kong VASPs can allow third-party custody, and Zhang says DigiFT will also provide custody if customers want it to.\n\nZhang says the bigger efficiency gains for traditional financial institutions is eliminating other intermediaries, not the custodian. Indeed, tokenization will create more roles for custodians: one for safekeeping the original security (a stock, a bond, or a fund structure), and a second for safekeeping the tokens.\n\nPeer-to-peer trading and settlement should, in theory, remove the need for a host of reconciliations and administrative roles that are required in TradFi. Those roles are instead upheld by a decentralized system for validating asset ownership and valuations based on the Ethereum network\u2019s blocks, which reduces or eliminates counterparty risks.\n\nBlockchain also enables investors to combine all of their assets and counterparties on a wallet they control, rather than rely on accounts handed to them by centralized service providers (eg by banks). This difference was the focus on DigiFT\u2019s work on building KYC and AML controls that satisfied the MAS.\n\nBuilding the ecosystem\n\nZhang acknowledges that today there is little in the way of an ecosystem \u2013 few issuers, and no discernable secondary market of liquidity providers or investors. But he says it will come as \u2018Web3\u2019 players converge with TradFi.\n\nFor example, TradFi investors have no trouble accessing US Treasuries, but need to be in the token world to stake on Ethereum (for example). Meanwhile tokenization allows stablecoin holders to place assets in tokenized US debt; MakerDAO, the algorithmic stablecoin operator, has become a major investor in tokenized T-bills.\n\nToday there\u2019s not much in the way of liquidity, but this convergence between crypto and TradFi will continue to generate activity, Zhang says. \u201cTwelve months ago, the people in Web3 and Web2 didn\u2019t talk to each other. Today we\u2019re at the beginning of a convergence.\u201d\n\nThe blockchain world still faces enormous hurdles, including primitive user-experience interfaces, lagging efficiency, and questions about security and safety. But as regulation reshapes the space, it can bring transparency, investor protection and the best learnings from traditional finance.\n\nAnd while Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed is poor compared to a credit-card processor or an equities stock exchange\u2019s matching engine, in terms of settlement it\u2019s already lightyears ahead.\n\n\u201cWe settle two or three blocks in 30 seconds, which is not efficient,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cBut what if you compare it to T+2 [settlement two days post-trade] in traditional equities?\u201d\n\nOne reason for Zhang\u2019s confidence is that he\u2019s seen this before. He\u2019s a career banker. As a product developer at Citi in China in 2001 he oversaw the buildout of its online payments system for RMB. \u201cWe faced the same issues then as we do today: can you trust this? Is there a use case? It\u2019s not efficient enough?\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s got licenses in hand, Zhang says he\u2019ll need to go back to the capital market for funding. DigiFT\u2019s raised two rounds, led by HashKey and Shanda Group (the pioneering Chinese games company). He reckons DigiFT will look to raise a Series A round for $5 million to $10 million in 2024, to help it hire talent, build out the ecosystem, and continue promoting digital assets."

        "content": "Cardano is constantly beating the \u201cghost chain\u201d claims, recently outperforming all other networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, to top the list of blockchains in chain activity.\n\nData from crypto-focused research and analytical resource Messari confirms this feat. According to Messari, Cardano currently leads in terms of chain activity over the past 24 hours. Notably, the metric employed by the platform to gauge a network\u2019s chain activity is its on-chain transaction volume.\n\nThis metric shows that Cardano beats every other mainstream blockchain network by an impressive margin. Interestingly, Cardano\u2019s 24-hour on-chain transaction volume currently stands at $23.56 billion. Notably, this represents all the transaction volume recorded yesterday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBefore now, Cardano\u2019s on-chain transaction volume averaged $9 billion every day throughout November. However, the network started witnessing an uptick in December, surging to a high of $11.32 billion on Dec. 2. This uptick persisted, with Cardano recording $29.86 billion on Dec. 9.\n\nDespite witnessing a drop in the days that followed, Cardano has maintained an intraday on-chain volume above the $18 billion mark. The recent $23.56 billion was recorded due to a new upsurge in this metric.\n\nMeanwhile, per Messari data, Bitcoin, the leading blockchain network, comes second on the list, with $13.09 billion in on-chain transaction volume, nearly half of Cardano\u2019s figure. Ethereum, the largest smart contracts network, secures third with just $5.06 billion in transaction volume.\n\nLitecoin sees a volume of $1.51 billion, while the XRP Ledger\u2019s volume only stands at $777 million. Other blockchain networks on the top ten list include Dogecoin, Tron, Bitcoin Cash, Verge, and Stellar.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nIt bears mentioning that on-chain volume is different from trading volume. Trading volume refers to the total number of shares, contracts, or assets traded on a specific market, especially on exchanges, during a given period. It is typically a measure of market activity and liquidity.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn the other hand, on-chain transaction volume involves the total number of transactions that occur on a blockchain. It includes all transactions, whether they involve trading, transfers, or other interactions within the network. On-chain transaction volume provides insights into the level of activity and usage of a blockchain.\n\nA high on-chain transaction volume indicates active use of a blockchain for various purposes, such as transfers, smart contract executions, and dApp interactions. This metric helps to evaluate the health and sustainability of a blockchain network, showcasing its utility beyond speculative trading.\n\nAmid the increased on-chain transaction volume, ADA, Cardano\u2019s native token, has witnessed an impressive price surge. ADA recently surged to a 19-month high of $0.68 today before facing opposition. Currently changing hands at $0.6349, the altcoin is up 42% over the past week."

        "content": "Ethereum price dropped close to the $2,100 level early on Wednesday, entering a crucial demand zone.\n\nOver 5.58 million wallet addresses hold nearly 40 million Ethereum tokens in the demand zone.\n\nAnalysts have predicted an ETH price rally to $3,000 since Ethereum\u2019s breakout past the $2,000 level.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, declined to $2,148 early on Wednesday. The fall in prices follows a broader sell-off in the crypto market since Monday, likely driven by investors\u2019 de-risking strategy ahead of a macro-packed week, with US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) last meeting of the year.\n\nEthereum price has entered a critical demand zone, according to on-chain metrics, in which market catalysts could help determine where ETH is headed next.\n\nAlso read: XRP price drop to $0.55 likely amidst Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s final push in US crypto legislation\n\nEthereum price reaches demand zone\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock, Ethereum price has dipped into a demand zone considered crucial for the altcoin. The price range between $1,934 and $2,160 is key for Ethereum price as this is a range where 5.58 million wallet addresses accumulated nearly 40 million ETH tokens.\n\nThis makes the demand zone a critical support for ETH. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), this makes it an ideal reloading point for traders looking to add more Ethereum to their portfolio before the altcoin\u2019s price rallies.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money ETH. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum price eyes $3,000 target\n\nSeveral crypto analysts on X said Ethereum is primed for a rally. Since ETH price tested and broke out of the psychological barrier at $2,000, these analysts say the altcoin is ready to target the $3,000 level.\n\nCrypto analyst behind the X handle @CryptoJelleNL argues ETH is ready to rally to $3,000 in the ongoing cycle.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart. Source: @CryptoJelleNL.\n\nAnother crypto analyst, Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa), agrees with @CryptoJelleNL\u2019s thesis and notes that Ethereum is likely \u201cone of the easiest trades.\u201d Sherpa notes that after ETH consolidated under the $2,000 level for nearly two years, the altcoin is finally out of the range and ready to catch up to the $3,000 mark in the coming months.\n\n$ETH: I still think that #Ethereum is 1 of the easiest trades you can take. It consolidated under the 2kish mark for almost 2 years and finally out of that range.\n\n\n\nThis is going to catch up for sure and I think that ETHUSD goes to $3k in the coming months. pic.twitter.com/ddX8l2s5Ux \u2014 Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2023\n\nIn its predicted run up to the $3,000 mark, Ethereum price is likely to face resistance in the range between $2,160 and $2,247, where 1.04 million wallet addresses bought 5.49 million ETH tokens, according to IntoTheBlock data. A break past $2,247 is key to validating the bullish thesis for ETH.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,171.38 on Binance. The altcoin is trading sideways close to the $2,100 level, after yielding nearly 5% weekly losses for holders."

        "content": "U.Today - is experiencing a crucial moment, facing the most significant pullback since the beginning of the bull run. This retracement is crucial for traders, with many keeping a close eye on the potential for a reversal at around the trendline support level on the . However, caution is advised, as the likelihood of a dramatic turnaround seems dim. The current market conditions and network challenges pose significant hurdles for Ethereum's immediate prospects.\n\nEthereum's price chart illustrates this recent downturn. After a period of consistent gains, ETH has encountered resistance, leading to a pullback that is stoking a mix of apprehension and anticipation among traders. The sharp decline in price from its recent highs has left investors questioning the durability of the bull run and whether Ethereum can muster the strength to pivot back to its former upward trajectory.\n\nA closer look at the price action shows has not yet exhibited the full magnitude of a reversal. One of the critical factors influencing Ethereum's performance is the support, or lack thereof, for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem built on its blockchain.\n\nUnfortunately, the network has been plagued with unstable conditions, manifesting in the form of enormous transaction fees. These issues have dampened enthusiasm for DeFi projects, traditionally one of the primary catalysts for Ethereum's demand and, consequently, its price.\n\nThe market's response to challenges has been tepid. Without robust support for the DeFi sector, Ethereum's potential for a swift recovery seems compromised. The high gas fees have notably deterred smaller investors and projects, which has a knock-on effect on the entire Ethereum-based DeFi landscape. This setback comes at a time when competition from other blockchains with lower fees and faster transactions is intensifying. However, Layer-2 networks on Ethereum might change this in favor of the second-biggest blockchain in the industry.\n\nThis article was originally published on U.Today"

As Panigirtzoglou states, \u201cWe believe that next year Ethereum will re-assert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThis optimism is grounded in the anticipated EIP-4844 upgrade, or Protodanksharding, scheduled for the first half of 2024. According to Panigirtzoglou, \u201cThe main catalyst is the EIP-4844 upgrade or Protodanksharding, which is expected to take place during the first half of 2024. We believe that this upgrade will likely prove a bigger step towards improving Ethereum network activity, thus helping Ethereum to outperform.\u201d Analysts are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s potential, given the technological advancements this upgrade promises.\n\nBitcoin Halving Already Priced In, Says JP Morgan\n\nJPMorgan analysts, including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, assert through a recent post that Bitcoin\u2019s positive factors in 2024 are already accounted for in its current price. According to Panigirtzoglou, \u201cAnd given the current ratio of the bitcoin price to production cost is around x2.0 at the moment, this would imply that the 2024 bitcoin halving event is largely in the price.\u201d\n\nThis analysis is based on the existing bitcoin price to production cost ratio, approximately x2.0, suggesting that the impact of the 2024 halving is already reflected in the market. The discussion revolves around why JPMorgan holds the view that the upcoming halving is less likely to significantly influence Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics. Despite potential positive developments, the analysts maintain a cautious stance on crypto markets.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nJPMorgan Deems DeFi\u2019s Progress \u2018Biggest Disappointment,\u2019 Cautious Optimism in VC Funding\n\nJPMorgan expresses disappointment in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector\u2019s struggle to penetrate traditional finance, hindering the broader crypto ecosystem\u2019s transition. Despite this setback, there\u2019s cautious optimism, as Panigirtzoglou mentions, \u201cWhile venture capital funding in the crypto space in the fourth quarter of this year has improved compared to a rather subdued rest of the year, the improvement appears \u2018rather tentative.'\u201d\n\nThe disappointment stems from DeFi\u2019s inability to make significant inroads into traditional finance. The examination of challenges includes the slow evolution of tokenization and the absence of regulatory frameworks. Despite these hurdles, there is a cautious outlook on the improved venture capital funding observed in Q4 2023. Analysts suggest that the persistence of this positive trend into Q1 2024 could signal the end of the crypto winter.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

        "content": "Cronos Labs, the web3 start-up accelerator behind the Cronos ecosystem, has launched a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) testnet blockchain network on top of the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared with CryptoPotato, the Cronos zkEVM Chain testnet is launched in an alliance between Cronos Labs, Matter Labs, engineering teams from digital asset exchange Crypto.com, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms VVS Finance, Veno Finance, and Fulcrom Finance.\n\nCronos Labs Launches zkEVM Chain Testnet\n\nThe Cronos zkEVM testnet is a hyperchain using the ZK Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (STARK) modular framework. As it is on top of the Sepolia faucet, the chain is secured by the Ethereum testnet from a final settlement and data availability standpoint.\n\nCronos Labs claims the new chain is the first public testnet utilizing the ZK Stack framework. As a hyperchain, the zkEVM testnet runs alongside a common settlement on the Ethereum mainnet. By 2024, the network will adopt a shared native bridge to the Ethereum mainnet, enabling users to send tokens and messages while enjoying the latter\u2019s security.\n\nKen Timsit, Managing Director of Cronos Labs, said: \u201cThe Cronos zkEVM testnet represents an opportunity for Cronos Labs and our partners, including VVS, Fulcrom, and Veno, to experiment with ZK layer 2 technology in order to prepare the next phase of growth starting in 2024. Other Cronos apps are warmly invited to join the testnet.\u201d\n\nCronos\u2019 zkEVM Testnet to Use TCRO\n\nThe new network uses a Boojum STARK-based ZK-proof system, which runs on general processing units (GPUs) while reducing fees. The zkEVM chain also uses TCRO, a testnet version of CRO, the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos ecosystem, to pay transaction fees. Cronos Labs said fee payments can be made in other cryptocurrencies due to the native account abstraction implemented at the protocol level.\n\n\u201cWhen we introduced the ZK Stack, we opened up the door for anyone wanting to build on top of Ethereum to do so by deploying hyperchains. Whether you\u2019re building a specialized Rollup or a general purpose one, hyperchains allow you to tap into Ethereum\u2019s extensive userbase base and liquidity while preserving its robust security and decentralization\u201d, said Marco Cora, senior vice president of business and operations at Matter Labs, the firm behind Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling solution zkSync.\n\nAs the latest sister chain in the Cronos network, the zkEVM testnet will ease the movement of liquidity between the ecosystem and Ethereum."

        "content": "In the realm of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has emerged not only as one of the pioneers in blockchain technology but also as a contender in the narrative of being \u201cdigital gold\u201d; This article aims to show Ethereum\u2019s evolving role as a store of value, akin to the traditional perception of gold, and explores the factors shaping this narrative.\n\nSmart Contracts and Inherent Value:\n\nIts primary distinction from Bitcoin lies in its ability to execute smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded terms. While Bitcoin is often hailed as a store of value due to its scarcity, Ethereum\u2019s value proposition extends beyond scarcity to include programmability. Smart contracts add an extra layer of functionality and utility to Ethereum, potentially enhancing its intrinsic value.\n\nThe versatility provided by smart contracts enables Ethereum to be more than just a medium of exchange. It serves as a platform for decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi), further contributing to its perceived value. Investors and enthusiasts view Ethereum not only as a digital asset but as a cornerstone of a decentralized ecosystem with myriad use cases.\n\nDecentralization and Security:\n\nSimilar to gold\u2019s historical appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature positions it as a potential hedge in the digital realm. The lack of dependence on a single central authority and the robust security of the Ethereum blockchain contribute to its reputation as a secure and resilient store of value.\n\nDecentralization aligns with the ethos of financial sovereignty, allowing individuals to have greater control over their assets. Ethereum\u2019s commitment to maintaining a decentralized network enhances its credibility as a long-term store of value, appealing to those seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems.\n\nChallenges and Considerations:\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s narrative as digital gold gains traction, challenges persist. Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, as part of Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, aims to address scalability and environmental concerns. However, the success and timing of these upgrades play a crucial role in solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as a store of value.\n\nMarket dynamics, regulatory developments, and competition within the cryptocurrency space are additional factors influencing Ethereum\u2019s narrative.\n\nAs the landscape evolves, Ethereum must navigate these variables to maintain and strengthen its status as a digital gold alternative.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s journey as a store of value, akin to digital gold, reflects the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Its unique attributes, including smart contracts and decentralization, contribute to a narrative that extends beyond being a mere digital currency. As Ethereum continues to grow and adapt to emerging challenges, its role as a store of value is likely to remain a focal point in discussions surrounding the broader implications of blockchain technology and decentralized finance."

        "content": "Rainbow Wallet, a non-custodial wallet, has launched a Rainbow Points rewards program. Aimed squarely at MetaMask's users, the firm also suggests a future Ethereum airdrop. This marks a watershed moment in the competition among Ethereum wallets.\n\nDubbed the \"first step towards including our community in the future success of Rainbow,\" the program distributes points to Ethereum users based on their on-chain activity. These include factors like wallet balance and, notably, rewards for shifting from the widely-used MetaMask wallet. Those who possessed at least one Rainbow NFT as of Monday are eligible for extra points.\n\nThis mirrors the tactics employed by Blur, a leading NFT platform, which successfully diverted market share from its competitor, OpenSea. By awarding points leading to its own token airdrop, Blur has given out hundreds of millions of dollars in tokens since its inception this year.\n\nKnown as a \"vampire attack,\" this strategy lures users from an established service to a newer one through more lucrative rewards. In this case, Rainbow is targeting MetaMask, the current market leader in Ethereum wallets. Rainbow's announcement promises up to 150,000 extra points for those who import their MetaMask wallets, emphasizing rewards for \"True Believers,\" Rainbow's most loyal users.\n\nIn a playful twist, Rainbow's tweet thread rebrands this move as a \"fox hunt,\" in a nod to MetaMask's fox mascot.\n\nHowever, Rainbow has yet to confirm if the points program is a precursor to a token airdrop. Elsewhere, MetaMask's token launch, hinted at in early 2022, remains unrealized.\n\nAirdrops are a staple in the DeFi world, offering free crypto tokens to wallet holders or early project contributors. These airdrops vary in distribution criteria, often rewarding active network participants.\n\nWith that, Rainbow is set to challenge MetaMask's dominance and reshape the Ethereum wallet ecosystem. This could alter how users engage with blockchain tech and DeFi, signaling a new phase in wallet competition."

The crypto market, known for its volatility, has been the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny in recent weeks, and the influx of such substantial capital has only added fuel to the speculative fire.\n\nOver $19.7 billion are flowing into #Bitcoin and #Ethereum today! This is around the same capital inflow we saw back in December 2020 before $BTC surged from $18,000 to $65,000! pic.twitter.com/pBALVN0C2c \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) December 14, 2023\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum on the Cusp\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $42,907, marking an impressive 4.16% increase in the last 24 hours. This surge is part of a broader uptrend, as Bitcoin has experienced a staggering 140.95% increase in value over the past year. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is also experiencing positive momentum with a current price of $2,285, reflecting a notable 5.00% increase in the last 24 hours and a substantial 72.82% increase in value over the past year.\n\nThese numbers are particularly noteworthy, considering the challenges and uncertainties that have characterized the global economic landscape during this period. The current state of the cryptocurrency market prompts questions about the driving forces behind this influx of capital and the potential implications for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market analysts are speculating on a variety of factors, including institutional interest, macroeconomic conditions, and the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment.\n\nInstitutional investors, often seen as key players in influencing the market, have shown an increased appetite for digital assets. The idea of cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties has gained traction, attracting significant investments from institutional players seeking diversification and new avenues for growth.\n\nThe macroeconomic landscape, marked by central bank policies and geopolitical tensions, has created an environment where traditional financial instruments may not be as attractive. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized nature and limited supply, are becoming increasingly appealing to investors looking for alternative assets.\n\nMoreover, the surge in interest and investment in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms built on the Ethereum blockchain has contributed to the overall positive sentiment around Ethereum. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum is often viewed as a key player in the broader crypto market, and its performance is closely watched by investors and analysts alike.\n\nWhile the recent capital inflow and price surge are generating excitement, caution remains a prevalent sentiment. The crypto market\u2019s volatility is a double-edged sword, capable of delivering substantial gains but also posing significant risks. As investors eagerly watch the charts, the coming days and weeks will undoubtedly provide more insight into whether the crypto market is on the brink of another historic surge or if a correction is in the cards."

        "title": "Know the Best Cross-Chain Bridges With their Features - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "The demand for blockchain is increasing because it enhances security and enables faster transactions. But this is not the only need for the community. Users also need interoperability within the chains. This is provided by cross-chain bridge services.\n\nMany blockchain platforms use different techniques to facilitate interoperability. The techniques include different consensus protocols, data storage, and execution environment. Examples of blockchain executing some of these techniques are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Solana which operates the exchange facilities\n\nWhat is Cross Chain Bridging?\n\nA cross-chain bridge helps in the transfer or exchange of information. This means the exchange of assets and information from one blockchain to another blockchain. Exchange around different blockchains is possible but it requires a high amount of fees and is also time-consuming.\n\nFor this exchange first, the cryptocurrency has to be changed into the fiat currency and the process also involves fees. After this, the user utilizes this currency into the desired cryptocurrency which is time taking.\n\nThe cross-chain bridges facilitate the exchange without the need for fiat currency. There is no requirement to change the cryptocurrency to the fiat currency. The transfer of one cryptocurrency to another is easily facilitated by cross-chain bridges which are fast, efficient, and secure. It also enables the transfer of smart contracts and NFTs from one blockchain to another.\n\nThere are several ways to enable transfers through a cross-chain bridge. One such way is through wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens encapsulated the value of one token inside another token.\n\nAnother approach is enabling the liquidity pool. With a liquidity pool, the cross-chain bridge provider holds pools of various coins where one can be exchanged for another.\n\n6 Best Cross-Chain Bridge\n\nPortal Token Bridge: Portal Token Bridge is built on top of a wormhole protocol that enables transfers of both tokens and NFTs across the bridge across different chains. When the token is bridged between chains the original token is locked on a smart contract and a new wrapped token is minted on the target chain.\n\nThe supported blockchain networks are Acala, Akgorand, Aptos, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, Binance, Polygon, Terra, etc. The supported tokens are USD, Maker DAO, Shiba Inu, Axie Infinity, Sandbox, etc\n\nSynapsis Bridge: The Synapsis protocol provides secure cross-chain communication through its universal interoperability model. Synapsis Bridge allows users to swap on-chain assets across 15+ EVM and non-EVM blockchains safely and securely.\n\nThe supported blockchain networks are Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, etc. Some of the supported tokens are Synapse, Wrapped Bitcoin, USD Tether, etc.\n\nUmbria Narni Bridge: The Umbria Narni Bridge facilitates blockchain asset transfer through a unique world where assets are held across multiple chains. It is a liquidity provision protocol to lower the cost and speed up the cross-bridging.\n\nIt holds multiple assets on multiple chains together in the liquidity pool. The supported blockchains are Fantom, Cardano, Polygon Mainnet, Ethereum Mainnet, BNB Chain, Avalanche, KuCoin community chain, Huobi Eco Chain, etc. And, some of the supported cryptocurrency coins are Ethereum, Polygon, Tether, USD coin,\n\nWrapped token, etc.\n\nIt is different from other cross-chain bridges because it does not rely on validator smart contracts which slows down the bridging process. By removing the necessity of validation it can complete the cross-chain transaction with cheaper fees.\n\nMultichain: It is a router protocol that facilitates the flow of data and assets across different blockchain networks. No other cross-chain bridge supports the exchange of so many tokens as Multichain. The supported blockchain includes Avalanche, Arbitrum, Astar Network, Bitcoin, BNB chain, Ethereum, Fantom, Terra, XRP, etc.\n\nCross Chain Bridge: The Cross Chain Bridge supports the transfer across various blockchains. The tokens and NFTs are easily transferred across multiple networks. The supported blockchain networks are Avalanche, BNB Chain, Polygon, Ethereum, and Fantom. The supported cryptocurrency tokens are Bridge, Bulk Tokens, Moonie NFT, Tether, and Wrapped Ethereum.\n\nCeler cBridge: The Celer cBridge is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge. It uses the Celer State Guardian Network to enable liquidity across different blockchains. It supports 40+ blockchains.\n\nSupported blockchain networks are Aster, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Moonbeam, Moonriver, etc. Some of the supported cryptocurrency tokens are Tether, USD coin, Thales, USD\n\nAdvantages and Challenges of Cross-Chain Bridges\n\nThe cross-chain bridge provides a wide range of advantages that include enhanced scalability and performance. Users can access more marketplaces and more assets on different blockchains.\n\nIt reduces network congestion as the user can move the assets and data to less crowded and cheaper blockchains. It also benefits the user with more advantages of blockchain like enhanced security, privacy, and scalability.\n\nThe cross-chain bridges also come with some challenges like compatibility, which need a high level of technical coordination between different blockchain and protocols. Sometimes, the security risk also arises due to malicious validators, oracles, or relayers that could compromise the bridge or manipulate the transactions."

        "content": "Bitwise Invest, an investment firm specializing in the crypto space, recently unveiled its anticipated crypto predictions for 2024.\n\nThese projections provide a glimpse into the future of the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting major milestones and potential breakthroughs for the largest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH), and exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin Predicted To Smash Records\n\nBitwise\u2019s first prediction suggests that Bitcoin will surpass previous records and trade above $80,000, setting a new all-time high. The firm attributes this bullish outlook to two key catalysts: the imminent launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) early in 2024 and the anticipated halving of new Bitcoin supply by the end of April.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise expects the spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved and to collectively become the most successful ETF launch in history.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nInterestingly, Bitwise also forecasts that Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, will witness its revenue double, surpassing Wall Street expectations by at least 10 times.\n\nThe firm points out that Coinbase\u2019s trading volumes typically surge during bull markets, and they anticipate a similar trend in 2024. Additionally, Bitwise highlights Coinbase\u2019s successful launch of various new products that have gained traction in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, the investment firm predicts that more money will settle using stablecoins compared to traditional payment giant Visa. Bitwise highlights stablecoins as one of crypto\u2019s \u201ckiller apps\u201d and notes their remarkable growth from virtually zero to a $137 billion market in just four years. Bitwise anticipates 2024 to be another significant year for stablecoin expansion.\n\nEthereum Set For Major Breakthrough\n\nBitwise expects Ethereum\u2019s revenue to more than double from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $5 billion in 2024. The firm attributes this growth to the increasing number of users flocking to crypto applications. Bitwise emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s potential as one of the fastest-growing large-scale tech platforms globally.\n\nFurthermore, Bitwise anticipates a major upgrade to Ethereum, labeled EIP-4844, which could reduce average transaction costs to below $0.01. This significant cost reduction is expected to pave the way for mainstream adoption and the development of groundbreaking applications within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Pundit Predicts That XRP Price Will Rise \u201cDramatically,\u201d Here\u2019s When 9 months ago\n\nBitwise\u2019s bonus prediction suggests that by the end of 2024, one in four financial advisors will allocate funds to cryptocurrencies in their clients\u2019 accounts. The firm foresees increased adoption by financial advisors once Bitcoin becomes easily accessible and mainstream.\n\nIn summary, Bitwise Invest\u2019s crypto predictions for 2024 paint an exciting future for the cryptocurrency market. With expectations of a new all-time high for Bitcoin, the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and revenue growth for industry giants like Coinbase and Ethereum, the crypto space is poised for significant advancements in the coming years.\n\nAs of the current update, ETH is trading at $2,200, reflecting a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. This positive movement follows a similar trend set by BTC. However, Ethereum has experienced a slight decline of 2.4% in the past seven days.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency wallet Rainbow made waves this week with the launch of its new rewards initiative called \u201cRainbow Points.\u201d On December 12th, Rainbow announced that they had taken a snapshot of all Ethereum blockchain activity and allocated points to Ethereum users based on factors like their wallet balances and usage of decentralized apps and services.\n\nKeypoints\n\nRainbow wallet launched a rewards program called \u201cRainbow Points\u201d for Ethereum users based on their on-chain activity\n\nUsers can earn more points by importing MetaMask wallets into Rainbow, holding Rainbow NFTs, using Rainbow for swaps/transfers, and referring friends\n\nThis is seen as a \u201cvampire attack\u201d on MetaMask to lure users away, with Rainbow calling it a \u201cfox hunt\u201d against MetaMask\n\nSpeculation that Rainbow points may lead to a future token airdrop, similar to Blur and other platforms\n\nOver 400,000 wallets are now showing on Rainbow\u2019s leaderboard after the points announcement\n\nWhile all active Ethereum wallets received a baseline level of 100 points, Rainbow offered additional incentives targeted specifically at MetaMask users. MetaMask is currently the most widely used wallet and gateway to decentralized apps, but Rainbow is positioning itself as a challenger by trying to attract MetaMask\u2019s loyal user base.\n\nImporting MetaMask wallets into Rainbow earns users up to 150,000 bonus points. Even more points go to those who have actively used MetaMask\u2019s built-in token swapping feature over the past year, with the amount correlated to their swap volume.\n\nRainbow Points resemble similar rewards programs from other crypto startups looking to gain market share from rivals. When NFT marketplace Blur introduced points that later converted into the platform\u2019s native BLUR token, it helped drive tremendous user growth and siphon activity away from OpenSea. Rainbow appears to be taking notes from this strategy.\n\nWelcome to Rainbow Points \u2014 the first step towards including our community in the future success of Rainbow Every Ethereum user has been dropped points today ???? Claim your points and start earning more by doing the things you already do onchain pic.twitter.com/UsUOOGxC0b \u2014 Rainbow (@rainbowdotme) December 12, 2023\n\nWhile comparisons to a \u201cvampire attack\u201d were made on crypto Twitter, Rainbow cheekily framed it as a \u201cfox hunt,\u201d calling out MetaMask\u2019s popular fox logo. Rainbow even taunted MetaMask by stating, \u201cAre you a MetaMask user looking to enjoy, not suffer through, Ethereum?\u201d\n\nThe insinuation is that features like an easy onboarding experience, multi-chain accessibility, integrated swapping, and NFT support make Rainbow a preferable choice over the incumbent MetaMask. Rainbow also appealed to users frustrated over MetaMask\u2019s lack of a native token or loyalty rewards to date.\n\nSome speculate that Rainbow Points may ultimately convert into a forthcoming token reward. This would follow the lead of other crypto startups like Blur which dropped a valuable native asset on early supporters.\n\nWhile Rainbow has not confirmed any potential token plans yet, it did state that the points program \u201cis the first step towards including our community in the future success of Rainbow.\u201d\n\nThe points initiative and anti-MetaMask messaging clearly struck a chord. Within 24 hours, over 400,000 wallets were appearing on Rainbow\u2019s public leaderboard of top point holders. Crypto users on Twitter shared stories of downloading Rainbow only to discover crypto tokens or NFTs they never realized they owned.\n\nThe frenzied response suggests Rainbow successfully incentivized new users to try its wallet app. But experts warn users should still exercise caution with any new service that requires entering a private key or seed phrase. As more Web3 users try out Rainbow for the points potential, MetaMask may need to consider countermeasures like finally launching its long-rumored token."

        "content": "Global football authority FIFA is pursuing a dual-blockchain strategy for its latest NFT drop commemorating the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar. The organization plans to leverage both Polygon and its existing partner Algorand to maximize reach.\n\nKeypoints\n\nFIFA is launching a collection of 1000 NFTs to commemorate the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup, with 100 rare NFTs on Algorand and 900 on Polygon\n\nThe NFT drop is part of FIFA\u2019s efforts to expand its presence in web3 while serving its existing community on Algorand\n\nThe rare Algorand NFTs will offer holders the chance to win tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Finals\n\nPolygon was chosen to reach a wider audience on Ethereum, but FIFA stated it remains committed to Algorand as well\n\nBoth Algorand (ALGO) and Polygon (MATIC) have seen falling prices over the last 24 hours amid a broader crypto market downturn\n\nOn December 15th, FIFA will drop 100 \u201crare collectible\u201d NFTs on Algorand\u2019s FIFA+ Collect platform, its dedicated NFT marketplace launched earlier this year. These rare pieces will provide holders the opportunity to win tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Finals, creating immense demand.\n\nThe remaining 900 NFTs from the collection will drop on Polygon four days later via OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace on Ethereum. These will provide digital memorabilia for collectors without the same level of exclusivity. By tapping Polygon, FIFA hopes to bring its NFTs to a wider audience familiar with Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nWe want to ensure that everyone clearly understood yesterday's announcement????

A spokesman stated the organization \u201cremains vigilant on the progress of the existing chains and community\u201d in determining its technology partnerships. For now, Algorand still plays a pivotal role.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of falling prices for both Algorand (ALGO) and Polygon (MATIC) amid a crypto market downturn. ALGO has shed 7.2% in the last 24 hours while MATIC is down 3.8%. However, both cryptocurrencies remain up substantially over the last six months having ridden recent waves in the market.\n\nAs the Web3 and NFT space matures, expect more traditional brands and entities like FIFA to leverage a multi-chain strategy. This provides the flexibility to engage with users across ecosystems while staying true to early-adopter communities on networks like Algorand. Although speculative, blockchain interoperability may one day render these complex decisions obsolete."
