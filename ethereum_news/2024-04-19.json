        "title": "Here\u2019s How Much a $1,000 Crypto Investment in Ethereum at Its Launch Would Be Worth Now - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "recep-bg / Getty Images\n\nI invest a little \u201cplay money\u201d in cryptocurrencies. And 2024 has been a great year for them.\n\nRead Next: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\n\nLearn More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nIn fact, I occasionally share the story about how I tried to invest in Bitcoin when it was worth under $1,000 a coin, but I couldn\u2019t get the transfer to the cryptocurrency exchange. Eventually, I gave up \u2014 and lived to regret it in the years to come.\n\nAlong those lines, how would you have fared if you\u2019d gotten in on Ethereum in its early days? How much would you have today if you\u2019d invested $1,000 at the launch of the second-most popular cryptocurrency?\n\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n\nEthereum, Then and Now\n\nIn July 2014, Ethereum held an initial coin offering (ICO), raising money for the project through Bitcoin. It worked like a crowdfunding project, where investors bought in (paying with Bitcoin) for early access.\n\nA year later, the actual Ether blockchain coins (ETH) started trading live at $0.31 per coin.\n\nAs of mid-April 2024, ETH trades at $3,157 per coin. That marks a roughly 10,000% increase in value.\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 at $0.31 per coin, you\u2019d have owned 3,225.81 ETH coins. At today\u2019s pricing, that would be worth $10,183,871.\n\nToday\u2019s pricing doesn\u2019t even represent Ether\u2019s peak. On November 9, 2021, ETH reached a dizzying $4,815. If you had cashed out your ETH coins at its zenith, you\u2019d have walked away with a cool $15,532,258.\n\nCrypto Halving\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies exist in ones and zeroes, rather than, say, physical gold and all the supply limitations attached to it, crypto creators must build in some type of scarcity.\n\nFor Bitcoin, that means halving the coins paid to miners for each block on a schedule of every 210,000 blocks. In fact, the next halving will likely have happened by the time this article publishes in mid-April.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether must add scarcity and limit production over time. But unlike Bitcoin, it does so with far more complexity. It does so through a \u201ctriple halving\u201d process including: fee burning, staking, and token issuance rate reduction. Read up on the Ether triple halving process for all the nerdy details.\n\nThat happens continuously, unlike the much-hyped halving events for Bitcoin. It produces the same result though: slowing new supply entering the market, to drive up values.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculation vs. Investing\n\nI opened by claiming that I \u201cinvest\u201d a little money in cryptocurrencies. The simple truth, however, is that I consider it speculating, not investing.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\n\nInvestments have intrinsic value. That value could come from its use, such as a home. Or it could come from revenue, in the case of a business or an apartment building. You can measure the investment\u2019s value based on that revenue, or based on comparable assets in the same market.\n\nCryptocurrencies don\u2019t produce revenue and have no tangible use. They\u2019re only worth wherever someone else is willing to pay for them, similar to collectibles like baseball cards or, dare I say it, non-fungible tokens (NFTs). To me, that makes them speculative.\n\nIs there an inherent value in a decentralized currency? I imagine so \u2014 but I have no idea what it might be, because there\u2019s nothing concrete to measure.\n\nBy all means, play around with money you can afford to lose in speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Just don\u2019t bet the farm on something that produces no revenue or measurable value.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Here\u2019s How Much a $1,000 Crypto Investment in Ethereum at Its Launch Would Be Worth Now"

        "content": "It may sound counter-intuitive that a decentralized network can generate a profit, but that is exactly what Ethereum has done so far this year.\n\nAccording to an April 18 Token Terminal report, the Ethereum blockchain generated a $369 million profit in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nIf this level of profit is sustained, the blockchain could generate around $1.5 billion for the year.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING: The Ethereum blockchain generated a $369.08M profit in Q1 \u201824. Wait, what?! How can a *blockchain* like @ethereum be profitable? Let\u2019s go through Ethereum\u2019s business model step-by-step: 1. Fees. All users on the Ethereum blockchain pay transaction fees in ETH\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gHAoNbRf48 \u2014 Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) April 18, 2024\n\nEthereum Blockchain Profitable\n\nToken Terminal explained that Ethereum\u2019s revenue model is based on network fees, which are the gas users pay for making transactions. Gas costs spiked in early March but have now fallen back to yearly lows.\n\nMoreover, a portion of the ETH is burned and removed from circulation for every transaction. This accrues to the economic benefit of existing ETH holders since issuance becomes deflationary during times of high demand.\n\nThere are also \u2018expenses,\u2019 which is the issuance of new ETH to the network\u2019s validators and stakers as an additional economic reward.\n\n\u201cThe difference between the daily USD value of the burned ETH (revenue) and the newly issued ETH (expenses) represents the daily earnings for existing ETH holders,\u201d it explained.\n\nCrypto investor and Etherean Ryan Sean Adams said that Ethereum wasn\u2019t like other blockchains. Over the past 18 months, Ethereum generated almost $1 billion in earnings, he added.\n\n\u201cThis puts Ethereum in the top 20 entities globally in terms of buyback yield at 0.23%.

The move presented a buying opportunity for a whale, who quickly profited from it. This also comes when Ethereum's buyback yield exceeds that of several S&P 500 firms.\n\nRead more: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nDaily digest market movers: Israel's retaliation, whale activity, buyback yields, Hong Kong's ETH ETF\n\nEthereum wasn't left out, as the entire crypto market took a hit on Friday following Israel's strike in retaliation to Iran's attack on April 13. Here are your key market movers:\n\nAs ETH dipped briefly on Friday, a whale jumped on the opportunity, spending 9.5 million USDT to buy 3,253 ETH at ~$ $2,925, according to crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain. However, ETH's price has quickly recovered, especially as Iranian officials have downplayed responding to the attack. As a result, the whale made nearly $625,000 in unrealized profit.\n\n\n\nEthereum is outshining major tech and financial giants in terms of buyback yields, according to Token Terminal. In a list of $200 billion+ finance and tech S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway, Ethereum ranks number 16, above Tesla and JPMorgan with a buyback yield of 0.23%.\n\n\n\nBuyback for Ethereum, in this case, is implemented through token burns that began after The Merge in 2022. The number one smart contract blockchain achieved this feat in only nine years compared to the median age of 44 years of other companies in the list.\n\nETH buyback yield\n\nAlso read: Ethereum moves sideways as Q1 report indicates token burns are making it deflationary\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expressed doubts that Mainland China investors may not get access to Hong Kong's spot ETH ETFs when they start trading. This pessimism is based on China's ban on all crypto-related activities in 2021. However, other analysts have pointed to Hong Kong's positive reception to crypto investment as a good sign that spot ETH ETFs would see impressive inflows when they launch in the region.\n\n\n\nDespite ETH's brief price decline, ETH's long liquidations weren't heavy, sitting around $34.4 million in the past 24 hours. This may be due to heavy liquidations already seen earlier in the week.\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue trading inside key range\n\nETH attempted to break the $2,852 support on Friday after Israel attacked Iran. However, prices have quickly bounced back, and ETH appears to be continuing its consolidation. The calm may be due to investors exercising caution as they await how the market responds to Bitcoin's fourth halving, which is a few hours away.\n\nRead more: Ethereum declines as crypto market crash increases bearish sentiment\n\nConsidering that many analysts have predicted that Bitcoin halving is already priced in, ETH may experience light volatility in the next few hours.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nBut in the coming weeks, it won't go outside the range of $2,852 and $3,406 formed in recent price movements, except if major external factors prevail on its price. In the long term, ETH could test the resistance of $3,730. An unlikely approval of spot ETH ETFs by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) would send it past the $4,000 key level to a new all-time high."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bitcoin roller coaster has taken another dive, breaking below the $60,000 mark and unsettling the market. This recent dip sees the cryptocurrency dipping its toes into the $58,000 territory, the least-expected move by the market. The fall through what many considered a solid support level at $60,000 is causing some panic.\n\nThis unsettling movement could have been seen as a dark cloud, but there is a silver lining that has the crypto faithful watching the calendar: the Bitcoin halving. Slated for around April 20, this event is historically known for shaking up the market in unexpected ways. The halving could tighten supply and potentially swing the pendulum back in favor of higher prices.\n\n\n\nLooking at the charts with a magnifying glass, we can see that Bitcoin's next support test lies at $58,572, just a stone's throw from where it is currently. If it fails to hold this line, the descent might continue toward the $50,319 area, where the next safety net lies.\n\nBut let's not write off Bitcoin just yet. If it can rally back and crack through the $60,000 ceiling again, it might just push back to its recent comfort zone. The first sign of recovery will be reclaiming ground above this critical level, with eyes then set on the $68,789 marker \u2014 a formidable resistance that could block the path to its previous highs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's farewell\n\nEthereum's slide below $3,000 is more than just a number \u2014 it is a signal. It tells us that the confidence that was pushing prices up is shaky. The drop has been steep enough to make even the staunchest supporters a bit nervous about what's coming next.\n\nWe have spotted some levels that could tell us where things might head. Right now, Ethereum is testing the waters below the $3,000 line. If it does not climb back up soon, the next floor might be around the $2,800 mark, a point that could offer some resistance to the fall. On the chance that Ethereum finds its feet again, watch out for the $3,200 ceiling \u2014 it is the next battle to win for recovery hopes.\n\nThere is a real chance that ETH could keep dropping, especially if it does not get back above $3,000 quickly. But with the halving in play, it is too early to count it out. A surge of inflows to the market might change the situation in favor of bulls quicker than anticipated.\n\nSolana remains suppressed\n\nSolana, the cryptocurrency that has been on many investors' watchlists, is showing signs of strain. After a period of growth, SOL has slipped through what was a strong support level at around $130, and now folks are worried. If prices keep heading south and pass below the $100 mark, it could spell real trouble.\n\nKey indicators that many traders look to for signs of healing, like RSI and moving averages, have been breached. Currently, Solana struggles to find a proper footing for the price.\n\nThe situation looks tense. With the support at $130 now a thing of the past, the next checkpoint is at $100.\n\nYet, not all hope is lost. There is still a chance for a turnaround. Growth could be around the corner if Solana manages to rally and break through resistance levels, particularly around $150, which could act as a ladder to climb back up from its current position.\n\nThe future of Solana is not set in stone. If it finds strength and pushes above these resistance levels, it might just regain its previous momentum. But if it continues to fall, the drop below $100 could be a hard reality check for the coin and its investors."

        "content": "Earlier today, amid news of the escalating geopolitical tensions and the Israel-Iran conflict, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market faced severe selling pressure. However, this dip once again met with a strong buying interest from investors. With the Ethereum price dropping to $2,877 earlier today, bulls are staging a strong recovery once again to $3,100.\n\nEthereum Gas Fee Drops to 3-Month Low\n\nRecent data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals a notable decrease in transaction costs on the Ethereum network. The cost of conducting a transaction on Ethereum has plummeted to $2.07, marking a significant reduction from the $15.21 recorded on March 4th during a period of heightened demand.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysts at Santiment suggest that transaction fees on the Ethereum network often reflect prevailing sentiments within the cryptocurrency market. During periods of extreme bullishness, characterized by the belief that crypto assets are poised for significant price increases (\u201cTo the Moon\u201d), transaction fees tend to peak. Conversely, during phases of pessimism when sentiments lean towards the belief that cryptocurrency markets are in decline (\u201cCrypto is Dead\u201d), transaction fees typically revert to lower levels.\n\nThis pattern of transaction fees mirroring market sentiment underscores the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets. Peaks in transaction fees often coincide with price tops for Ethereum, while periods of low transaction costs are observed around price bottoms.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Layer-1 competitors like Solana have witnessed a huge surge in DeFi activity along with the recent meme coin frenzy. This competition has also led to network decongestion on Ethereum thereby keeping the gas fee on the lower side.\n\nETH Price Action Ahead\n\nEthereum made another attempt at recovery but encountered resistance near the $3,100 mark, reminiscent of Bitcoin\u2019s struggles. Despite stabilizing above $3,000 initially, a bearish sentiment prevailed, pushing the price below this support level to briefly dip below $2,900. The bottom was established at $2,867 before a rebound ensued.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is in the process of recovering from its losses, having surpassed the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward movement from $3,278 to $2,867. However, it continues to trade below $3,100 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average (SMA).\n\nThe immediate hurdle for Ethereum lies near the $3,020 level, followed by a significant resistance zone around $3,070, coinciding with both the 100-hourly SMA and a key bearish trend line forming on the hourly ETH/USD chart. Further resistance is anticipated around $3,120, aligned with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. A successful breach above $3,120 could pave the way for a potential upswing towards the $3,200 mark.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum aims for $1 billion annual profit as DeFi gains momentum in Q1 - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nEthereum is on track to reach a $1 billion annual profit, driven by the surge in decentralised finance (DeFi) activities and the network's robust performance in the first quarter of 2024. In a report by Michael Nadeau, an analyst at The DeFi Report, released on April 17, Ethereum's Q1 income reached an impressive $365 million, representing a 155% year-on-year quarterly revenue growth and a remarkable 200% increase compared to the $123 million profit recorded in Q4 2023.\n\n\n\nEthereum's fee revenue, generated through user transactions, reached a notable milestone of $1.17 billion in Q1, marking a 155% increase from the same period in 2023 and an 80% upswing from the previous quarter.\n\n\n\nMichael Nadeau highlighted key insights from the Q1-24 issue of The Ethereum Investment Framework, stating, \u201c ETH available on exchanges is at its lowest level since 2016, and ETH in smart contracts is at its highest level ever\u201d.\n\n\n\nThis year, Ethereum's daily transactions have exceeded last year's figures and are nearing the peak observed in 2021. Over 1.15 million average daily transactions were recorded in 2024, showing a slight increase from the 1.05 million seen last year and coming close to the peak of 1.25 million transactions observed in 2021.\n\n\n\nSince its launch in 2015, Ethereum didn't achieve profitability until 2023, when it earned $623 million. Despite this milestone, its revenues were 75% lower than the peak of $9.9 billion recorded in 2021. Nadeau explained that this decline is largely attributed to the transition to proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022, resulting in an approximately 80% drop in token incentives paid to miners, now known as validators.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn terms of token economics, the network\u2019s average daily issuance in Q1 was 2,498 ETH. This was offset by an average of 3,665 ETH burned/day resulting in deflation of -.09% for the quarter (annualised to -.38%)\u201d, Nadeau further stated in the recent report.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, as of today, due to Israel-Iran tensions, Ethereum's price has continued to drop to $2865 overnight, posing a challenge to the $3000 resistance level. Over the past seven days, Ethereum has experienced a decrease of 12.17%, but today, before noon, it has seen a 4.42% increase, with ETH now standing around $3,100.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "title": "Ethereum Liquid Restaking Drives DeFi TVL to $100B in Q1 2024 - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Ethereum Liquid Restaking Drives DeFi TVL to $100B in Q1 2024 Luisa Crawford DeFi TVL nearly doubled in Q1 2024, reaching $98 billion, partly due to Ethereum's liquid restaking initiatives. However, a recent crypto market pullback has led to a decline to $86.6 billion.\n\nWhen compared to the previous quarter, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralised finance (DeFi) approximately doubled during the first quarter of 2024, indicating that DeFi has witnessed tremendous growth from the previous quarter. It is possible to ascribe, at least in part, this spike to Ethereum's liquid restaking activities, which have been the driving force behind the expansion of DeFi TVL prices. Protocols such as Lido and EigenLayer have been essential in this growth, since they have contributed to the widespread adoption of liquid staking and restaking.\n\nRecent study indicates that DeFi TVL experienced a significant increase from a low of $36 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 to a high of approximately $97 billion in the first quarter of 2024. This is an increase of 81% and marks a high point for DeFi TVL that has been reached in the last two years. There was a modest rise in the TVL data that Messari gave, and he said that the amount of DeFi collateral climbed by 65.6% from the previous quarter to reach $101 billion. A number of factors, including the rise in the values of underlying assets and the implementation of liquid restaking, have contributed to the expansion of TVL.\n\nBoth asset price appreciation and liquid restaking were the primary factors that contributed to the increase of Ethereum's total value of assets (TVL), which was roughly 71% higher than before. Lido and EigenLayer are two examples of protocols that have played a significant role in the revival of DeFi TVL since its inception. On March 13, liquid staking TVL achieved an all-time high of $63 billion. This result was mostly driven by the Ethereum liquid staking protocol Lido, which now controls a market share of 62% of the liquid staking ecosystem. In addition, during the first three months of 2024, the liquidity restaking protocol known as EigenLayer seen a significant increase in both its popularity and its utilisation. The total value of EigenLayer's TVL reached $12 billion at the conclusion of the quarter, representing a stunning 990% rise. EigenLayer makes it possible to stake Ethereum several times, which results in increased returns.\n\nIn addition to liquid restaking activities, user activity also played a big influence in the expansion of DeFi TVL. This growth was not just contributed by liquid restaking initiatives. In the most recent quarter, QuickNode recorded a significant increase in user activity of 29.1% compared to the previous quarter, which has spurred expectations of a second \"DeFi Summer\". Despite the attempts of the SEC to regulate the decentralised finance area, there are indications that expansion and a paradigm change are on the horizon.\n\nHowever, the current retreat in the cryptocurrency market has resulted in a decrease in the value of DeFi TVL that has been seen. As this article is being written, the value of DeFi TVL has dropped by 11%, reaching $86.6 billion. The entire value of assets that are locked in DeFi protocols has been negatively impacted as a consequence of the larger market slump, which has cause this reduction.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Ethereum revenues grew significantly in Q1 despite price volatility\n\nETH\u2019s price started to see green again as network growth fell\n\nEthereum [ETH] took a massive hit in terms of price over the last few days. However, it\u2019s worth looking at the bigger picture too, with the same revealing that Ethereum\u2019s network has been doing really well, despite the recent price fluctuations.\n\nEthereum had a very positive Q1. In fact, Ethereum achieved a profit of $370 million from $825 million in revenue, equating to a net income margin of approximately 45%.\n\nEthereum revenue on the rise\n\nIf Ethereum was listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, it would lead the net income margin (%) rankings, with Microsoft, Adobe, and Veeva following closely. In terms of total profits across all publicly traded software companies, Ethereum would rank sixth.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization stood at approximately $350 billion, placing it on par with tech giants such as Salesforce.\n\nHowever, there are significant caveats to consider here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s historical performance may not be as stellar, and its structure deviates from traditional corporations. Unlike a typical company, Ethereum\u2019s token functions as both a utility and a form of \u201cequity.\u201d Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s valuation is considerably higher than traditional software companies, when compared by revenue multiples.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nThe growth of Ethereum in Q1 and its potential for growth in the next quarter can help aid the bullish narrative around the network. Moreover, the revenue generated through L2s after the Dencun upgrade can also help the Ethereum network in terms of profitability.\n\nDespite all these favorable things happening for Ethereum, the price of ETH fell materially over the past week. It depreciated by over 11% and slipped past the $3,000-mark, before recovering again. However, the interest in ETH grew after this drastic decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that even though the price of ETH recovered, its network growth flatlined.\n\nThis indicated that the number of new addresses interacting with ETH fell. A lack of interest from new addresses in ETH could affect the price movement of the altcoin significantly going forward."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, April 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape constantly evolves, investors and market observers are closely monitoring several key developments that could shape the sector's future. Among these are Bitcoin's upcoming halving event, Ethereum's current price fluctuations due to significant whale activity, and the rise of new players like Furrever Token (FURR), which seeks to carve out a niche with its unique approach and potential high returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan Cautions Against Expecting a Bitcoin Rally Post-Halving Event\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community braces for this year\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, scheduled around April 19-20, JPMorgan has issued a less than optimistic forecast. Contrary to the significant price surges that followed previous halvings, the banking giant predicts that Bitcoin might not only fail to rally but could potentially see a decline in value.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin halvings have been pivotal moments that typically led to bullish market behavior. The process involves halving the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This mechanism serves as a counter to inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, such events have boosted the cryptocurrency's market price significantly within a year of occurrence. For instance, after the 2012 halving, Bitcoin's price increased from $12 to $135 over the next 300 days.\n\nHowever, this year's scenario presents a unique backdrop. According to JPMorgan\u2019s analysis, the current market conditions are \"overbought\". Bitcoin's price, hovering around $61,200, is well above the $45,000 mark when adjusted for volatility in comparison with gold. This elevated baseline, combined with the peak price reached a month before the halving\u2014a first in Bitcoin\u2019s history\u2014suggests a different outcome might be unfolding this time around.\n\nAdding to the cautious outlook, Goldman Sachs has also advised prudence. The firm highlighted the unpredictable macroeconomic factors currently at play, which could influence Bitcoin's performance differently compared to past cycles. Despite previous patterns of price appreciation post-halving, Goldman Sachs warns against assuming similar outcomes this year, given the distinct global economic conditions.\n\nThis tempered expectation marks a significant shift in sentiment among financial giants regarding the crypto market's behavior following the halving. As the event nears, the cryptocurrency community and investors are keeping a watchful eye, prepared for a range of possibilities that diverge from the historical norm.\n\nEthereum Price Volatility Continues as ICO Whale Offloads Significant ETH Holdings\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently experiencing heightened volatility, underscored by a recent 4% drop in price amid broader crypto market fluctuations. This latest dip has triggered a wave of speculation about the future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKey to the current market unrest is the activity of an ICO whale who has significantly reduced their holdings, selling off 2,000 ETH for 6 million USDC at a rate of $2,997 each. This move comes after additional transactions where the same whale offloaded 5,110 ETH on various platforms, with the price per ETH approximately at $2,545. Despite this large-scale sell-off, the whale still possesses about 29,700 ETH, which currently values approximately $89.4 million, held primarily across staking platforms.\n\nAdding to the market\u2019s unease, Whale Alert has flagged more Ethereum moving towards exchanges. Notably, an unknown wallet transferred 10,806 ETH to Coinbase, worth roughly $32.13 million, followed by another transaction of 10,726 ETH to the same exchange, valued at around $31.90 million.\n\nThese substantial movements to a major exchange like Coinbase are raising alarms about potential further increases in Ethereum\u2019s price volatility. However, amid these concerns, some analysts maintain a cautious optimism, buoyed by positive developments such as the recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, which may indicate a rebound or stabilization in the market soon.\n\nMoreover, with the cryptocurrency community looking forward to the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, there is anticipation that this might also spur positive movements in Ethereum's price.\n\nAs the situation develops, Ethereum's current trading price stands at $2,978.31, marking a decrease of 3.45% from the previous day, with a trading volume that has risen by 10.77% in the last 24 hours. Despite this, Ethereum's price has seen a substantial 16% decline over the past week and an 18% drop over the last month, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty and the speculative nature of the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Emerges as a Strong Contender Against Established Cryptocurrencies\n\nIn the competitive world of cryptocurrencies, Furrever Token (FURR) is carving out a niche for itself with a current price of $0.000564 and promising features that could potentially outperform major players like Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON). What sets Furrever Token apart is its unique appeal rooted in the universal love for cute kitties, aiming to create a delightful and engaging experience for its users.\n\nThe charm of Furrever Token extends beyond its cat-themed aesthetics, encompassing a range of stickers, emojis, and visuals that enhance the user interface. This strategy not only enriches the community experience but also strengthens the bond among its members, fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\nOperating on the BNB-20 blockchain, the Furrever Token is designed with favorable tokenomics. About 65% of its tokens were made available during the presale, with the remainder distributed between decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the development team. This distribution strategy promotes fairness and ensures the longevity and stability of the project.\n\nFinancially, Furrever Token is not just about the novelty; it offers significant return potential, boasting up to 15X returns which highlights its attractiveness as an investment. To secure its platform and user investments, the token has undergone rigorous audits, emphasizing its commitment to security and compliance.\n\nThe project\u2019s dedication is further evidenced by its active community engagement and transparent communication, critical factors that contribute to its growing legitimacy and appeal as an investment.\n\nAs Furrever Token continues to evolve and attract attention in the crypto market, its innovative integration of fun elements with serious financial prospects positions it as a formidable alternative to well-established cryptocurrencies like Solana and Toncoin. With strong community support and distinctive features, Furrever Token is poised to make a significant impact on the future landscape of cryptocurrency.\n\nFor further information or any assistance regarding Furrever Token, reach out only through the official channel at support@furrevertoken.com to avoid potential scams.\n\nSecure the Most Exclusive Presale Opportunity of 2024 Today!\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website | Visit Furrever Token Presale\n\n\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group | Follow Official X Account\n\n\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport@furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

According to an update from crypto analytics platform Token Terminal, Ethereum is currently ranked 16th in terms of buyback yield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the list shared by the platform, Ethereum outshines some big names on the list, including Elon Musk\u2019s electric car manufacturing giant Tesla Inc and multinational banking giant JPMorgan Chase. This feat shows Ethereum goes beyond just its role as a smart contracts enabler; it also has what it takes to compete when profiled as a finance-based tech entity.\n\nOne intriguing observation pointed out by Token Terminal regarding the impressive stat is that compared to the average age of firms on the list, which is 44 years, Ethereum is only about nine years old.

The same holds for Ethereum. While JPMorgan is regarded as the biggest bank in America, Alphabet Inc., the company that tops the chart, is a tech and Cloud Services giant.\n\nEthereum operates as a smart contract enabler, pioneering a move for innovators to build decentralized applications that have helped it grow its decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL) to $92.74 billion.\n\nBesides Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum is the second-most-backed crypto project in terms of whale holdings.

        "title": "Ethereum Poised to Retest $3.5K as Bullish Sign Reappear (ETH Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After experiencing a rapid downturn, Ethereum has found itself supported by a substantial zone, comprising the 100-day moving average and a critical price range between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels. Consequently, a bullish rebound is anticipated in the medium term.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough examination of the daily chart reveals an extended period of corrective retracements, culminating in the price finding support within a pivotal zone.\n\nThis zone encompasses the 100-day moving average at $3050 and the significant price range between the 0.5 ($3190) and 0.618 ($2972) Fibonacci levels.\n\nThis range carries significance as it attracts considerable demand, potentially hindering further downward pressure from market sellers. Additionally, a minor bullish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for a bullish resurgence, targeting a reclaim of the $3.5K threshold. However, despite the bullish indications, an unexpected breach below this critical support zone could trigger a cascade effect toward the 200-day moving average at $2.5K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer inspection of the 4-hour chart reveals the formation of a descending wedge pattern during a multi-month consolidation correction. Following a significant decline, the price has reached the lower boundary of the wedge and the support region around $3K.\n\nNonetheless, given the potential buying pressure within this crucial range, the price has entered a consolidation phase characterized by minimal volatility.\n\nThis price action highlights a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Nevertheless, a noticeable divergence between the price and the RSI indicator on the 4-hour timeframe suggests the strength of buyers, increasing the likelihood of a bullish upswing in the medium term. In such a scenario, the next target for the price would be the critical resistance level at $3.5K. Conversely, should a break below this support occur, a descent toward the $2.7K support becomes increasingly probable.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Ethereum\u2019s price exhibits signs of recovery, it\u2019s crucial to determine whether this resurgence stems from spot buying or leveraged futures activity. A key metric for this analysis is the funding rates, where positive values signify bullish sentiment and negative values indicate fear in the market.\n\nObserving the recent downtrend in Ethereum\u2019s price, it\u2019s notable that the funding rate metric has mirrored this trajectory, steadily declining until reaching near-zero levels. This alignment suggests that the recent price drop has led to the liquidation of a significant number of positions in the perpetual market, resulting in a cooling effect on the futures market. Consequently, the market appears primed for the re-emergence of long positions, with the potential for a fresh upward surge."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop to $60,000 or lower as investors cash in on BTC halving news.\n\nEthereum price could make a bullish breakout if altcoin market cap seesaws against BTC price.\n\nRipple price holds above support, could reclaim above $0.5783 as XRP bulls reawaken.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains lull, but the outlook seen among altcoins is different with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) holding above key levels. It comes following the successful arrival of the fourth BTC halving, which has Bitcoiners and market enthusiasts euphoric.\n\nBITCOIN 'HALVING' CUTS IN HALF REWARDS PAID TO MINERS \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) April 20, 2024\n\nThe highly awaited Bitcoin halving finally happened on Saturday, with the Bitcoin block height hitting 840,000. In the aftermath, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 3.22% to $2.32 trillion. It comes as altcoins begin to reawaken, with most flashing green to outperform the pioneer cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin halving concludes successfully as BTC miner rewards reduce to 3.125\n\nBitcoin price could drop to $60,000\n\nBitcoin price remains lull following the conclusion of the BTC halving, and in the \u2018sell the news\u2019 situation the big crypto risks a correction to $60,000 or lower. Notice the lower lows and lower highs on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), showing momentum is dropping.\n\nIn its place, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) is edging toward negative territory as the red shade intensifies. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has slipped below the orange band of its signal line, suggesting a potential bearish cycle.\n\nBitcoin price could drop below $60,000 to test the $59,530 support or extend lower to the $50,420 threshold.\n\nBTC/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, a surge in buying pressure could send Bitcoin price further north. A decisive candlestick close above the $70,000 psychological level on the 3-day time frame would confirm the continuation of the uptrend. This could see BTC price reclaim its $73,777 peak, or higher to record a new all-time high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: When should BTC peak post-halving?\n\nEthereum price coils up for a breakout\n\nEthereum price is consolidating within a falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal technical formation that could see the largest altcoin rise. ETH is back above the $3,000 level and could record a bullish breakout as the market capitalization of altcoins seesaw against that of Bitcoin.\n\nThe RSI is tipping north, primed to recover above the 50 mean level. If it does, it could precipitate a strong move north for Ethereum price to extend higher.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart\n\nConversely, early profit booking among the bears could see Ethereum price drop, with a slip below $2,850 support negating the bullish thesis. This could see the fall extend to the depths of $2,500.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum resumes consolidation after brief dip, buyback yield exceeds that of major S&P 500 companies\n\nRipple price shows strength\n\nRipple price could move up as it holds above the ascending trendline. The RSI seems primed for a pullback as it rejects further downside as it holds above 34. If XRP bulls are able to haul above 50, it could kick off a strong move north, sending Ripple price above the $0.5783.\n\nA decisive candlestick close above this level on the three-day timeframe would encourage more buy orders. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, bulls should watch for a candlestick close above $0.7630, the mean threshold of the supply zone between $0.7277 and $0.7959.\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears pull XRP price below the ascending trendline, it could encourage a sell off to send the Ripple price to the $0.4183 support. In a dire case, the altcoin\u2019s price could drop all the way to the $0.3078 support.\n\nAlso Read: XRP fails to break past $0.50, posting 20% weekly losses"

        "content": "Ethereum transaction fee fell to a four-month low on the charts\n\nThis could be a sign of a decline in user activity on the network\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s latest update, Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] transaction fees have fallen to their lowest level since January.\n\nSantiment revealed that the average fee per transaction on the Proof-of-stake (PoS) network was $2.34, at press time. This represented an 84% decline from its year-to-date (YTD) peak of $15, recorded on 5 March.\n\n? #Ethereum's network costs just $2.07 to make a transaction, a far cry from the $15.21 that it cost back on March 4th when demand was excessively high. The market historically moves between sentimental cycles of feeling that crypto is going \"To the Moon\" or feeling that \"Crypto\u2026 pic.twitter.com/OKjhmHnYQE \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 18, 2024\n\nDecline in network activity\n\nThe drop in Ethereum\u2019s network fees is attributable to the fall in user activity on the blockchain over the past month. According to Artemis\u2019 data, Ethereum has seen a decline in daily demand and activity over the last 30 days.\n\nFor example, the daily count of unique addresses interacting with Ethereum since 19 March has cratered by 7%. Due to this, the number of unique on-chain interactions with the network has dropped. With 1.2 million transactions completed on Ethereum on 17 April, the network has recorded a 14% drop in daily transaction count in the last 30 days.\n\nThe drop in user activity on Ethereum impacted the performance of its non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors too.\n\nRegarding NFT activity on Ethereum, sales volume on the network has fallen significantly over the past month. According to CryptoSlam, NFT sales volume on the PoS network totalled $288 million in 30 days \u2013 Logging a 57% decline.\n\nAn indicator of decline in the network\u2019s DeFi vertical is its total value locked (TVL). According to DefiLlama\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s TVL at press time was $49 billion, declining by 14% since its YTD peak of $57 billion.\n\nDue to the drop in Ethereum\u2019s network activity, ETH\u2019s supply has turned inflationary. This means an uptick in the amount of ETH coins that are being created and added to the circulating supply, adding to the downward pressure on the altcoin\u2019s price.\n\nIn fact, according to data from Ultrasound.money, ETH\u2019s supply has risen by over 2,667 ETH over the past week alone.\n\nETH local top reached?\n\nIn its post, Santiment opined that the decline in Ethereum\u2019s network fee may suggest that its price is near its bottom and that a rally may be on the horizon. To determine whether a price bottom is in, observing ETH\u2019s Age Consumed metric is key. This metric tracks the movement of previously idle coins.\n\nWhen the coin\u2019s Age Consumed rallies, it suggests that many long-held and idle coins have begun to change hands. This indicates a strong shift in the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nOn the other hand, a dip in ETH\u2019s Age Consumed metric suggests that long-held coins remain in wallet addresses without being traded.\n\nThe metric is a good marker for local tops and bottoms because long-term holders rarely move their dormant coins around. Therefore, whenever this happens, it results in major shifts in market conditions.\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, ETH\u2019s Age Consumed rose significantly on 18 April, confirming that a bottom might be in.\n\nHowever, a cursory look at the past few times the coin\u2019s Age Consumed recorded similar highs revealed that these episodes were followed by price declines \u2013 A sign that tops were reached. This may yet be the case for the world\u2019s leading altcoin.\n\nAlso, current market sentiment remains significantly bearish, with the Bitcoin halving event less than 24 hours away. And, readings from the coin\u2019s price chart suggest that it may already be priced in."

This 68.56% increase resulted in processing 3.2 million transactions in a day, according to L2BEAT data.\n\nETH Transaction Per Second Chart | Source : L2BEAT\n\nDespite its high TPS, Degen Chain saw low trading volume at $819,600, with an average transaction value of $0.27, contrasting sharply with Ethereum\u2019s $1,867 and Base\u2019s $170 averages.\n\nExperts caution against overreliance on TPS as a scalability metric, noting its failure to consider transaction complexity. Degen Chain\u2019s success is attributed to its Degen (DEGEN) token, initially a tipping token on Farcaster.\n\nThe platform now boasts $4.1 million in locked value, with the DEGEN token\u2019s market cap at $345 million. Degen Chain is hailed as an ultra-low-cost layer 3 blockchain, leveraging Arbitrum Orbit and Base\u2019s settlement layer for scalability.\n\nDegen Chain\u2019s success, despite low trading volume, showcases the potential of its DEGEN token and its innovative approach to layer-3 blockchain technology."

        "content": "Ernst & Young (EY) has launched OpsChain Contract Manager (OCM), an Ethereum solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs technology.\n\nThe solution will help private businesses efficiently manage and execute intricate business agreements while ensuring confidentiality, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nEY Launches the OpsChain Contract Manager\n\nEY, one of the top \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms alongside Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC, has been exploring the business applications of zero-knowledge proofs (zk proofs) since at least 2018.\n\nOpsChain Contract Manager (OCM) is tailored to facilitate the secure management of business contracts on a public blockchain. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, OCM ensures contract integrity and confidentiality while enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform integrates with existing enterprise systems through a standardized API and supports various contract types, including volume purchase agreements and pricing models linked to market data feeds.\n\nThe development of OCM came from EY\u2019s previous client engagements, where it realized that contract term accuracy could be enhanced while significantly reducing cycle times and administrative costs by approximately 90% and 40%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, EY chose Ethereum, a public blockchain, over a private network to prevent any party from gaining undue advantage while mitigating the risk of sensitive business information leakage.\n\nPaul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, highlighted that the technology behind OCM, Nightfall, initially emerged on Ethereum and underwent testing on its test network. The upcoming update will transition Nightfall to Ethereum\u2019s mainnet and may incorporate a Layer-3 upgrade to enhance scalability and functionality.\n\nEY\u2019s Venture Into Blockchain\n\nEY\u2019s launch of OpsChain Contract Manager comes amid increasing blockchain adoption by major financial players. BlackRock also recently entered the space with a tokenized fund on Ethereum.\n\nEY\u2019s OCM reflects its commitment to revolutionizing how enterprises handle contracts, focusing on enhancing process efficiency and transparency through blockchain solutions. By integrating blockchain into traditional business practices, EY sets a precedent for the industry\u2019s progression toward embracing this transformative technology in routine operations.\n\nThis latest development builds upon EY\u2019s ongoing engagement with the blockchain sector. EY recently made headlines with a \u201chealthcare breakthrough\u201d by leveraging blockchain technology in collaboration with Canadian Blood Services.\n\nIn October 2023, EY unveiled the fourth generation of its EY blockchain analytics tool, Reconciler, designed to aid Fidelity in enhancing internal risk management for digital assets.\n\nIn September 2021, EY also announced its collaboration with Polygon to integrate Polygon\u2019s solutions with EY\u2019s flagship blockchain services, including EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer."

Chainwire \u00b7 \u00b7 3 min read\n\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release. Readers should conduct their own research prior to taking any actions related to the content mentioned in this article. Learn more \u203a\n\nDubai, United Arab Emirates, April 19th, 2024, Chainwire \u2013 The Telos Foundation today announced that it will work with Ponos Technology, the leading Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) research and development firm, to develop an end-to-end optimized, hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network featuring SNARKtor, the Telos-developed decentralized recursive proof aggregator. The teams will take a hardware-software co-design approach that will help unlock new possibilities in terms of massive scalability, greater data protection and trustless interoperability for Ethereum users globally.\n\nPonos Technology provides end-to-end optimized solutions for ZK proving, which is essentially achieved by leveraging FPGA acceleration, thus maximizing business value streams through cost-performance optimized computation by matching hardware-software co-designed modules and dedicated execution environments. The team includes a unique blend of experienced scientists and highly skilled industry experts that have accumulated deep technical knowledge on all aspects of ZKPs.\n\n\u201cZero Knowledge technology is going to become increasingly mainstream and can open the door to increased efficiency and security across so many industries,\u201d said Slobodan Lukovic, CEO and co-founder, Ponos Technology. \u201cSimilarly to AI, steady enhancements in algorithms coupled with advancements in underlying hardware infrastructures will enable commoditization of ZKPs and result in the technology being widely adopted in the near future.\u201d\n\nTelos will also be working with several other new partners during the development cycle, including:\n\nDigital M.O.B. \u2013 One of the strongest Ethereum developer teams in the world, having worked on projects including MetaMask, MakerDAO and Gnosis, among others.\n\nATKA \u2013 A Paris-based end-to-end Web3 incubator that has helped incubate world class projects such as Morpho and Mangrove, and whom Telos announced a strategic partnership with in March 2024.\n\nCometh \u2013 An award-winning dev team led by ETH France President Jerome de Tychey, who joined Telos as a technical EVM advisor also in March 2024.\n\nTelos Executive Director John Lilic, who helped lead pioneering teams at Consensys and Polygon in addition to maintaining his role as a Top 50 Web3 angel investor, will help coordinate and support the transformation. He will work closely with Alberto Garoffolo, Head of ZK technology at Telos and co-author of the SNARKtor whitepaper, and Jesse Schulman, CTO and Head of Engineering at Telos.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, Ethereum will need to take a hardware-software co-design approach in order to realize zkEVM performance at tremendous scale,\u201d said Lilic. \u201cThat\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking with Ponos Technology and our growing partner network as we build a hardware-accelerated zkEVM L2. We believe that this formula, alongside the exciting work our team is doing with recursive proofs via SNARKtor, is going to offer compelling services to the Ethereum community and beyond.\u201d\n\nTelos was created in 2018 through a fair drop network launch that did not include an ICO nor token sale. Over the past six years, the Telos Foundation has helped steward the development of two primary networks \u2013 Telos EVM and Telos Zero \u2013 and will now also focus on building a highly performant and succinctly provable L2 zkEVM.\n\nAdditional details on the Telos L2 will continue to be announced in the lead up to EthCC in July, for which Telos is a primary sponsor. Live in Brussels from EthCC, the Telos team plans to broadcast its first-ever demo of SNARKtor to the world as a precursor to the official launch of the Telos L2.\n\nAbout Telos\n\nTelos is a decentralized blockchain ecosystem that includes Telos EVM, which tested as the fastest Ethereum Virtual Machine globally, and its high-speed consensus layer, Telos Zero. The project is also focused on expanding its capabilities with novel Zero Knowledge technology through the development of a hardware-accelerated Ethereum Layer 2 network powered by SNARKtor, which promises to enhance privacy and scalability for global use cases. Telos is overseen by The Telos Foundation, an ownerless foundation dedicated to advancing the Telos blockchain network and its community.\n\nContact\n\nThe Telos Foundation\n\n[email protected]\n\nShare"

However, Tether\u2019s [USDT] recent behavior could help improve sentiment around ETH.\n\nUSDT gets into the mix\n\nAccording to Lookonchain\u2019s data, over the past 18 hours, a significant amount of USDT, specifically 318 million dollars worth, has moved from Tether\u2019s treasury wallet to exchanges on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis outflow has significantly reduced Tether\u2019s holdings on Ethereum. Their treasury held only 124 million USDT at press time.\n\nTo meet potential demand, it\u2019s expected that Tether will soon mint another 1 billion USDT on Ethereum.\n\nTether has a history of minting large amounts of USDT, often corresponding with periods of increased cryptocurrency activity. This doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a surge in Ethereum usage.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the dominant platform for USDT, other blockchains like Tron could also be used for the same purposes.\n\nAt press time, the gas usage on the Ethereum network had remained the same over the last few days. However, the NFT trades occurring on the network had declined significantly.\n\nThis suggests other types of activity are picking up the slack. DeFi transactions, stablecoin swaps, or general token activity could be contributing to the steady gas usage.\n\nOn the NFT side, a market correction or declining public interest may be playing a role.\n\nHow are holders doing?\n\nEven though activity on Ethereum was consistent, the price movement of ETH wasn\u2019t showing signs of green. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,000.70 and its price had declined by 2.74% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIf the price continues to decline further, it may cross the $3,000 level for good, which could further cause panic in the markets.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nDue to this massive decline in the price of ETH over the last few days, the MVRV ratio for ETH fell considerably. This indicated that the most holders not profitable at the time of writing.\n\nHowever, the volume at which ETH was trading at had grown by 11.79% as well during this period."

        "title": "Famous Analysts Predict Dogecoin and Ethereum Bull Run, As KangaMoon Hits Over $4.8M In Presale - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nRecent data released by on-chain analytic firms indicates that Ethereum (ETH) holders have been scooping massive amounts of this leading crypto. The massive accumulation spree was due to the highly anticipated bull market run for the crypto. In the meantime, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has predicted a potential Dogecoin (DOGE) bull run, as KangaMoon (KANG), a unique altcoin, recorded an impressive over $5 million during the last presale stage.\n\nMikybull Crypto Analysis Indicates a Dogecoin Bull Run\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a popular altcoin that has been making significant gains in March. The price of Dogecoin surged by more than 90% to reach the $0.20 level. However, despite Dogecoin\u2019s impressive stand last month within the altcoin market, Mikybull Crypto, in his recent Dogecoin analysis, said that the real bull run for DOGE is about to kick off.\n\nBased on the expert\u2019s analysis, the price prediction for Dogecoin is aiming at the $0.30 mark. If Dogecoin manages to break past this level, then it might extend its gains even past the next few coming weeks. Other analysts seem to be backing this sentiment, highlighting the possibility of the Dogecoin price breaking above the $1.00 mark within this bull cycle.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Whales Set on An Accumulation Spree\n\nContrary to Dogecoin, Ethereum (ETH) has had quite a rough month, with the Ethereum price dropping by at least 13% in March. As per LookOnChain records, several of the top Ethereum coin holders took advantage and increased their ETH portfolios as the prices dropped.\n\nAccording to LookOnChain, a wallet reportedly owned by Matrixport managed to move over 22,250 Ethereum tokens, currently worth around $80M, off Binance. A similar wallet also withdrew at least 3,092 ETH worth $11.12M from the same exchange. Such a huge purchase is a clear indication that the price prediction for Ethereum might be anticipating a huge rally.\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) Nears $5M\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) is standing out as a unique altcoin to invest in 2024. With a sensational presale that has managed to lure lots of investors with a unique approach and those who believed in early received gains of up to 290%, KangaMoon continues to hit new milestones, surpassing the $5 million during the presale, nearing the $5.5 million mark by next week. On the other hand, KangaMoon is set to achieve the $7 million milestone by the end of April.\n\nLots of investors have been investing in KangaMoon due to its upcoming P2E game, which is set to be launched. In the game, players will have the chance to utilize KANG tokens as the primary in-game currency. The platform also plans to realize different regular challenges for KANG holders to participate in and get rewarded with extra tokens as well as different in-game assets.\n\nWith a community-driven approach, KangaMoon has managed to attract over 20,000 registered members within the platform. KangaMoon also rewards its most active members with free KANG tokens by just commenting, sharing and retweeting KangaMoon\u2019s social media posts.\n\nThe current price of the kang tokens stand at just $0.196 in its stage five presale. This is such a significant price compared to its original price of just $0.005. With such success, KangaMoon boasts over 5,800 token holders, positioning itself as the best new coin in 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe recent purchasing spree for Ethereum indicates a positive sign, as the whale accumulations normally precede a market rally. Moreover, Dogecoin and KangaMoon stand out as the best altcoins to invest in.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://KangaMoon.com/\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/KangaMoonofficial\n\n*This article was paid for.

        "content": "Ethereum could fall under the $3k psychological support zone soon\n\nMetrics flashed a strong buy signal, but there\u2019s more that investors need to consider\n\nLately, Ethereum [ETH] has seen bearish sentiments strengthen behind it. In fact, a Santiment post on X (formerly Twitter) revealed that both Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum saw a hike in bear posting ahead of the halving.\n\nNegative engagement on social media saw a positive change on 18 April when BTC bounced to $64.1k and ETH to $3,094. AMBCrypto analyzed other metrics to understand if investors should be buying ETH now.\n\nDrop in gas fee could be a disguised threat\n\nAMBCrypto noted that the Open Interest behind Ethereum has slid dramatically over the last ten days. It fell from a peak of $7 billion on 9 April (Ethereum priced at $3638) to $4.6 billion, at press time (Ethereum priced at $2997).\n\nThe sharp decline in OI meant speculators feared going long and lacked bullish conviction. It conveyed bearish sentiment. The 1-day RSI was also below neutral 50 for the most part since 18 March. This implied that momentum has favoured the sellers for a month now.\n\nThe average fees on the network have also been in decline. A recent AMBCrypto report highlighted that although it is a positive for users, it also points to a drop in demand for transactions on the blockchain.\n\nAddressing the buying opportunity\n\nThe $3k psychological support zone would have been a fantastic buying opportunity a month ago. It still might prove to be. The 90-day MVRV ratio was below zero at press time, showing an undervalued asset and holders at a loss.\n\nHowever, the mean coin age has adamantly trended higher for three weeks. Together, they signalled investors to buy Ethereum.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAnd yet, the dormant circulation saw a massive spike on 18 April. This highlighted a flurry of token movements and could foreshadow a wave of selling. Moreover, Bitcoin was barely hanging on to the $61k support zone at the time of writing.\n\nPatience and prudence could be extremely beneficial for investors. The likelihood of another sell-off is still high. The possibility of another month or two of consolidation following the halving, in light of recent overheated market conditions, is high too."

        "title": "Solana to $1000 or Ethereum to $10,000? This analyst is betting on\u2026 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Crypto-analyst bets SOL could hit $1k and outshine ETH in this cycle\n\nETH proponent believes the altcoin could climb as high as $10k\n\nCrypto-Twitter is back on the Solana [SOL] vs. Ethereum [ETH] debate again. So, which token will emerge as this cycle\u2019s best performer? Well, as expected, both the Solana and Ethereum camps feel they\u2019ll emerge to be top.\n\nIf the last 24 hours are taken into account, it would seem that SOL has a headstart of sorts. While SOL hiked by 9.5% and climbed back above $140 on the charts, ETH appreciated by a mere 3%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nSolana also outperformed Ethereum in Q4 2023 on the price charts. It\u2019s not surprising then that crypto-analysts like Ansem are uber-bullish on SOL. In fact, in doing so, he also downplayed Ethereum\u2019s edge on Solana, stating,\n\n\u201cThere is not a single thing Ethereum does better than Solana, was true before the metrics shifted last year and is even more true now with objectively verifiable data. $1,000 per $SOL\u201d\n\nThe analyst also cited Solana\u2019s commendable improvement in DEX (decentralized volume), daily active users, and validator data to predict a 7x potential surge from its press time levels.\n\nEthereum is still a big shot\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum\u2019s community is confident the token can hit $10k on the charts. Some community members like Ryan Adams of Bankless actually think that the target should have been reached by now.\n\nReferencing ETH\u2019s massive revenues, Adams recently claimed,\n\n\u201cNo, Ethereum isn\u2019t like the other chains. Ethereum is profitable. Over the past 18 months, Ethereum generated almost $1 billion in earnings.\u201d\n\nAdams added,\n\n\u201cEthereum is only 9 years old. ETH should be over $10k based on this alone.\u201d\n\nApart from higher revenue, TVL (Total Value Locked), and overall market cap, Solana dwarfs Ethereum on several fronts, as evidenced by a previous AMBCrypto report.\n\nHowever, the price chart performance is the most crucial for HODLers. A possible ETH move to $10k from $3.1k means a potential 3x upswing. Even if you take the wildest estimates, ETH\u2019s 3x would be way lower than SOL\u2019s 7x potential.\n\nIn other words, SOL might have higher potential for gains if the bull cycle explodes. That being said, ETH could play catch-up if the United States finally approves Spot Ethereum ETFs."

        "content": "Bitcoin price update: After taking investors on a rollercoaster for the last two weeks, the crypto market started to move up on Friday, hours before Bitcoin halving. Investors who had been anxiously waiting for the green light rallied behind BTC price and also the altcoins, most of which are witnessing modest gains.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network, is up 1.6% in the last 24 hours and trading at $3,105. Similarly, Solana moved in tandem with the rest of the market, with its value rising by 6.5% to $145.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana plummeted to $120 last weekend as geopolitical tensions ravaged through the market, leaving behind liquidations in billions of dollars and investors counting losses.\n\nThe cumulative market cap has gone up by a staggering 5.4% to $2.47 trillion in just a day, underscoring the bullish outlook in the wider market. Select altcoins moved in double-digits like Toncoin\u2019s 17% surge to $7.20 and Internet Computer\u2019s 11% increase to $13.\n\nBitcoin price Update: Is The BTC\u2019s Sudden Move Topping $65,000 Sustainable?\n\nAs Bitcoin halving approaches, the buzz in the market catches momentum, encouraging investors to bet on further movement toward the $70,000. From a 24-hour low of $59,651, Bitcoin price sits above $65,000 toward the end of the European session on Friday.\n\nA sizeable 15% bump in the volume upholds the improving sentiment and rising interest among traders. Another 5% surge in the market cap to $1.28 solidifies BTC\u2019s position as the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBased on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the four-hour chart, the ongoing movement seeking higher support above $65,000 could be sustainable in the short term, especially if the hype around the halving continues.\n\nMeanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is in line to prevent BTC from correcting significantly below $65,000. However, it is wise to prepare for a short-lived sweep for fresh liquidity at the black ascending trend line.\n\nA daily close above $65,000 would signal another confirmation of the uptrend eyeing $70,000 post-halving. The red band on the chart represents potential selling pressure and may delay the rally.\n\nBitcoin ETF Net Outflow Volume Shrinks\n\nRising net outflows in the Bitcoin ETF have been putting pressure on the price and the market, adding to the uncertainty due to the tensions in West Asia. Iran for the first time in history directly attacked Israel, sending over 300 ballistic missiles in its airspace.\n\nIf the war in West Asia escalates due to Israel\u2019s potential retaliation to Iran\u2019s attack, the global risk asset markets including crypto could suffer even more.\n\nHowever, SoSoValue shows that the total daily net outflow volume in the ETF market declined to only $4.39 million on Thursday. Grayscale is still posting the highest outflow volumes, with $89.99 million withdrawn from GBTC ETF on April 18.\n\nThere has also been a shift in the best-performing ETFs, with Fidelity leading the net inflow with $37 million and BlackRock coming second with $18.76 million.\n\nThe Bitcoin price rally in Q1 to a new ATH of $73,737 as seen on CoinGecko was mainly fuelled by growing demand for the ETF.\n\nExperts say that demand for the ETF coupled with the impact of Bitcoin halving on the supply of the scarce digital asset would be the ingredients like to make the next bull run. Bitcoin price is expected to peak above $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metric flashed a bullish sign on the charts\n\nHowever, key technical indicators suggested that the coin\u2019s price may fall further.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] Age Consumed metric climbed to a one-month high on 18 April. This rally was followed by a slight uptick in the altcoin\u2019s value too, suggesting that a local bottom might have been hit, according to Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nIs the bottom in or not?\n\nTo assess whether a price bottom is in, it is important to assess ETH\u2019s Age Consumed metric. This metric tracks the movement of its long-held idle coins. It is regarded as a good marker for local tops and bottoms because long-term holders rarely move their dormant coins around. Therefore, whenever this happens, it often results in major shifts in market trends.\n\nWhenever this metric spikes, it indicates that a significant number of previously held idle tokens have begun to change hands. It hints at a strong shift in the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nOn the other hand, when an asset\u2019s Age Consumed dips, it means that long-held coins remain in wallet addresses without being traded.\n\nIn fact, according to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s Age Consumed rose to a high of 1.6 million on 18 April. Although ETH\u2019s price briefly fell below $3,000 after this, it quickly rebounded to exchange hands at $3,059 at press time.\n\nSince 18 April, the crypto\u2019s value has risen by 3%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhy caution is necessary\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s Age Consumed hinted at the possibility of an uptrend, an assessment of the coin\u2019s price movements on the 1-day chart revealed that the short-term outlook remains significantly bearish.\n\nUnderlining that bearish power exceeded bullish activity in ETH\u2019s market, its positive directional index (green) rested under its negative index (red).\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhen these lines of an asset\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) are positioned this way, it is a sign that the market trend is bearish and the price is under significant pressure from the sellers.\n\nAdditionally, readings from the ETH market\u2019s moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator confirmed the prevailing bearish trend, with the MACD line below its signal and zero lines.\n\nWhen these lines are positioned this way, it indicates a strong bearish trend in the market and confirms the possibility of a further decline in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nMarket participants often see it as a signal to exit long positions and take short ones. Simply put, it might be a tricky time to navigate Ethereum\u2019s market right now."

        "content": "In comparison to Ethereum and Base, where the average transaction values are $1,867 and $170, respectively, Degen Chain sees a notably lower average transaction value of $0.27.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Degen Chain, a recent addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, has achieved the highest transaction per second (TPS) rate among Ethereum layer-3 networks.\n\nOn the last day, Degen\u2019s transaction per second (TPS) count surged by over 68% to reach 37.12 TPS, surpassing its underlying blockchain, Base, which stood at 30.81 TPS, as reported by L2BEAT\n\nArbitrum One, Ethereum, and zkSync Era completed the top five rankings.\n\nWith Degen\u2019s 35.7 TPS multiplied by 86,400 seconds in a day, the memecoin chain handled a total of 3.08 million transactions during that period.\n\nDespite its high transaction throughput, Degen Chain recorded only $846,191 in trading volume over the last day, ranking it 41st out of 66 blockchains tracked by CoinGecko.\n\nDespite its widespread use in measuring a blockchain\u2019s scalability limits, transactions per second (TPS) is considered by many industry leaders as a flawed metric.\n\nThis is because TPS fails to account for the computational size of each transaction, which can vary significantly and impact the network\u2019s overall performance. This oversight suggests that TPS alone may not fully represent a blockchain\u2019s capacity or efficiency.\n\nThe Degen (DEGEN) token, which was initially conceived as a tipping token for users engaging with Degen\u2019s channel on the Farcaster platform, has evolved beyond its original purpose.\n\nIt now serves as the primary currency of a memecoin that has transitioned into its own blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, Degen Chain currently holds $4.1 million in total value locked, while the DEGEN token, which is only three months old, commands a market capitalization of $326 million.\n\nDegen Chain, regarded as an ultra-low-cost, application-specific layer 3 blockchain, was constructed using Arbitrum Orbit and utilizes Base\u2019s settlement layer, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution.\n\nRead also: Sora Ventures & Metaplanet partner for \u2018Asia\u2019s Microstrategy\u2019"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s metrics remained bearish.\n\nXRP and BNB looked bullish, however.\n\nWhile all eyes remain on Bitcoin [BTC] halving, altcoins might silently take the cake as they were planning a bull rally.\n\nAs per the latest data, the Altcoin market capitalization had reached a level that was historically followed by price upticks.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto checked top alts like Ethereum [ETH], BNB, and XRP to see whether history would repeat itself.\n\nAltcoins are preparing for a rally\n\nBitcoin is expected to undergo its fourth halving soon. Once executed, it will reduce the mining reward by 50%, decreasing from the current 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins.\n\nThe previous halving happened back in 2020, when BTC\u2019s block reward was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25. At a time when everyone had a keen eye on BTC, altcoins acted interestingly.\n\nTitan of Crypto, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting altcoin market capitalization. As per the tweet, the Fibonacci retracement level was at 61.8% on the monthly chart.\n\nIf history is to be considered, each time the metric reached that level, altcoins began bull rallies in the following days. To be precise, similar incidents happened in 2021 and 2016.\n\nWill ETH, BNB, and XRP lead?\n\nAt press time, altcoins were having a tough time. To see whether the trend could change, allowing them to start a bull rally, AMBCrypto first analyzed ETH\u2019s state.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven-day average, suggesting buying pressure was weak.\n\nIn fact, selling sentiment among funds and trust investors was high, as evident from its red Funds Premium. Derivatives investors were also selling ETH as its taker buy/sell ratio turned red.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at how XRP has been doing. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP was down by over 20% in the last seven days. The price drop triggered accumulation as buying pressure surged.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that XRP\u2019s exchange outflow spiked. The fact that buying pressure was high was also proven by its supply on exchanges, which dropped last week.\n\nInvestors were also confident in XRP, as its positive sentiment graph remained high.\n\nThings for BNB also looked pretty optimistic. While most cryptos bled, BNB held its ground well, as its value surged by 1.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nRead Binance Coin\u2019s [BNB] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nWhile the coin\u2019s price rose, its Open Interest also increased. A hike in the metric suggests that the ongoing price trend might continue further.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, if XRP and BNB\u2019s metrics translate into bull rallies, then they might lead the next altcoin season while post-Bitcoin halving."

        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggle to meet investor expectations with lackluster performances, all eyes turn to Furrever Token (FURR) and its promise of substantial returns. With disappointment looming over the performance of ETH and SHIB, investors seek solace in FURR\u2019s potential for huge ROI opportunities.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market experiences turbulence, fueled by uncertainties surrounding major tokens, Furrever Token emerges as a beacon of hope, offering a unique and charming investment proposition. Will FURR\u2019s irresistible blend of cuteness and profitability be enough to appease disappointed investors and steer them towards brighter horizons?\n\nEthereum (ETH) Faces Uphill Battle Amid Market Turmoil: Will it Rebound or Continue its Descent?\n\nAmidst market turmoil, Ethereum (ETH) struggles with its price of around $3,051.89, down 1% from yesterday. A recent flash crash, prompted by Middle East tensions, caused ETH to plummet over 16%, raising fears of further decline. The breach of crucial support at $3,000 exacerbates ETH\u2019s vulnerability. Diminished hopes for a spot Ether ETF in the U.S. and declining sentiment compound Ethereum\u2019s challenges.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped from 76 to 57, signaling a shift from \u201cextreme greed\u201d to \u201cgreed\u201d among traders. This reflects heightened fears of continued market downturns, prompting investors to sell. Ethereum\u2019s dip below $3,000, a critical level, emphasizes its struggle to regain support.\n\nIntoTheBlock data reveals resistance around $3,000, where 1.98 million addresses previously held ETH. Any upward movement faces strong selling pressure from investors aiming to break even. Key support levels include $2,800 and the 200-day EMA at $2,710.\n\nThe downward indicator confirms the MACD trend, suggesting favorable conditions for further declines. However, reclaiming $3,000 could trigger bullish sentiment, aiming for levels above $3,300. Beyond, $3,500 becomes a target for bullish investors seeking a reversal.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Critical Crossroads: What Will the Future Bring?\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is currently navigating through a significant correction phase, with its price hovering around $0.00002237, up by 2% since yesterday. However, investors remain dissatisfied with SHIB\u2019s lackluster performance, which has endured nearly a 20% decline since last week.\n\nDespite this, recent price movements suggest a potential for recovery as SHIB encounters a critical golden ratio support level. Reflecting a trend in many meme tokens, Shiba Inu\u2019s price has surged to a key support level of around $0.00002 after a notable correction.\n\nPreviously rejected near the 0.382 Fibonacci resistance point at approximately $0.000037, the meme token now faces a possibility of an upward trend from the golden ratio support towards the significant resistance barrier at around $0.00002464, marked by the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA).\n\nWhile indicators present a mixed outlook, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in neutral territory and moving averages displaying a bullish crossover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines suggest a downward trend, albeit with rising momentum shown by the MACD histogram.\n\nAmidst these contradictory signals, SHIB could encounter significant Fibonacci resistances at $0.0000287 and $0.000035 if it experiences an upward trend. However, a breach below the golden ratio support around $0.00002 could find substantial support near the 50-week EMA at an estimated $0.00001426.\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Offers You a Huge Opportunity with Its Amazing ROI\n\nCalling all SHIB and ETH investors!

        "content": "Investors are accumulating Ethereum in droves amidst what could become a return to bullish sentiment for the cryptocurrency. Ethereum is currently ranging around $3,170, with its price undergoing volatility in the past seven days.\n\nAmidst this price volatility, on-chain data has revealed an accumulation trend from Ether investors during the week. Additionally, transaction data has shown an uptick in whale movement of ETH to and from exchanges, with recent market happenings indicating a transformation in the price of the crypto asset.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAll Quiet On The Bitcoin ETF Front \u2013 Should You Be Paranoid? 5 months ago\n\nEthereum Sees Major Accumulation As Investors Stock Up\n\nEthereum is now at a fundamental junction which could see its price surging in the new week and beyond. This fundamental catalyst for a price surge has come through the recent entry of Spot Ether ETFs into the Asian market.\n\nRegulators in Hong Kong have greenlit the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs along with Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the country, prompting investors to make strategic ETH movements in light of an incoming price surge.\n\nParticularly, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a strategic accumulation pattern from ETH investors, with over $500 million worth of ETH leaving centralized exchanges in the past week. Interestingly, this surge in movement is the highest single-week outflow from exchanges recorded on the Ethereum network since February.\n\nHalf a billion $ETH was withdrawn from CEXs this week, the highest since February pic.twitter.com/rwvftXjiOz \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 19, 2024\n\nWhen investors withdraw crypto from exchanges, it usually means they\u2019re looking to hold it for the long term. This behavior shows that these investors have confidence that the price of ETH will increase in value in the near future.\n\nSimilarly, data from whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts shows an uptick in ETH whale transactions during the week, with whale outflows from exchanges outpacing inflows.\n\nTotal crypto market cap currently at $2.322 trillion. Chart: TradingView\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Ether?\n\nDespite the outflows from exchanges, a concurrent selloff in exchanges drove the price down below $3,000 during the week to bottom out at $2,878. However, the currency has since reversed to the upside and is showing signs of a bullish momentum. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,180 and is up by 4% in the past 24 hours.\n\nFundamentals surrounding Ethereum point to steady price growth during the weeks as the bulls look to clear the $3,200 price hurdle. One example of such catalysts is a new draft bill aimed at legitimizing stablecoins in the United States. As the blockchain network with the biggest stablecoin market, Ethereum is set to benefit from a clear-cut positive regulation regarding stablecoins.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Fueled Up: Will 320 Million USDT Inflow Ignite Price Surge? 5 months ago\n\nWhile the US SEC continues to hesitate about the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs in the country, this investment class is set to be launched at the end of April in Hong Kong. Ethereum ETFs hitting the Asian market signals growing institutional interest in the altcoin in all corners of the globe. This, in turn, could lead to the price of Ethereum surging past its current yearly high of $4,066.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced notable volatility amid market price fluctuations. Despite this uncertain environment, Ethereum aims to maintain its price above the crucial $3,000 support zone.\n\nPart of the volatility can be attributed to increased whale activity involving ETH, as significant amounts of the token are being transferred to exchanges. For instance, Whale Alert data on April 20 indicated that 10,911 ETH, valued at approximately $33.52 million, was transferred to Coinbase.\n\nSuch large movements to major exchanges like Coinbase raise concerns about sustained volatility in Ethereum\u2019s price, especially considering the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset\u2019s susceptibility to overall market bearish sentiments.\n\nCurrently, ETH is trading at $3,062.73, having corrected by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. On the daily chart, Ethereum dipped to a low of $2,900 before experiencing a brief uptick.\n\nMeanwhile, on the weekly chart, ETH is down over 6%. Amidst this volatility, the primary focus is on how Ethereum\u2019s valuation will evolve in the coming days.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nEthereum price AI prediction\n\nEthereum is teetering just above the $3,000 zone, a critical juncture, as losing this level could trigger a further downward trajectory. Seeking insights into Ethereum\u2019s potential future movements, Finbold turned to predictions from artificial intelligence (AI) machine algorithm models at CoinCodex.\n\nAccording to data retrieved on April 20, Ethereum is projected to trade at $3,117.08 on May 1, representing an increase of approximately 1.7% from its current valuation.\n\nETH prediction, May 1, 2024. Source: CoinCodex\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that May has significant regulatory implications for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to decide on approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nShould this product receive approval, its potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics remains uncertain. It will be crucial to monitor whether it will echo the precedent set by similar ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH\u2019s key support zone to watch\n\nAmid ongoing uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s price, crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautioned on April 16 that should ETH continue a downward trend, investors should closely monitor the critical support zone between $2,000 and $2,430.\n\nWithin this range, approximately 9.37 million addresses hold nearly 53 million ETH. A breach of this support zone could potentially intensify selling pressure and exacerbate the downturn.\n\nETH money in/out chart. Source: IntoTheBlock/ali_charts\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s technical indicators remain predominantly bearish. A summary of the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicates a \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 13, with similar sentiments reflected in moving averages and oscillators at 10 and 3, respectively.\n\nEthereum technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn conclusion, despite prevailing bearish sentiments surrounding Ethereum, the asset stands to benefit from any bullish resurgence in the broader market, likely driven by the aftermath of the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

With an extended consolidation, the ETH price appears to be close to a breakout as the trend remains largely stagnant.\n\nAs mentioned above, the price continues to trade within a range after experiencing a shot time upswing to the resistance, which further coincided with the resistance area. Further, the price made a minor correction and soon backed up to the resistance area but later declined to the bottom part of the rally. However, the decline appears to be a bearish trap, as the trend could flip in a short while, causing a significant rise in the price, probably above $3300.\n\nAs seen, the price continues to trade within a descending triangle, but the recent accumulation within a narrow range suggests a diverse trend could be in the making. Therefore, it has now become extremely crucial for the token to break the consolidation as the bulls remain short of strength to lift the levels beyond the resistance. But the recent bounce up close to the resistance line has raised hopes for a breakout in the coming days.\n\nAlso Check Out : Will Ethereum-Based Tokens Rebound As Top Altcoins Stumble Again?\n\nIt appears pretty evident that the price may soar beyond resistance as the volume has dropped to a large extent. Hence, after an extended compression, the price is expected to trigger a rebound. Moreover, following the pattern, the price is required to trigger a pullback below the support, but the accumulation along the resistance, flashes bullish signals for crypto. Therefore, the Ethereum (ETH) price is believed to maintain a sideways trend for some more time, which could result in a bearish pullback, followed by a bullish rebound beyond $3300 initially and later at $3500.\n\nRead More : XRP Price Ready to Breakout?
