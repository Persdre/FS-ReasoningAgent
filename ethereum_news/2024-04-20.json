        "content": "recep-bg / Getty Images\n\nI invest a little \u201cplay money\u201d in cryptocurrencies. And 2024 has been a great year for them.\n\nRead Next: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\n\nLearn More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\n\nIn fact, I occasionally share the story about how I tried to invest in Bitcoin when it was worth under $1,000 a coin, but I couldn\u2019t get the transfer to the cryptocurrency exchange. Eventually, I gave up \u2014 and lived to regret it in the years to come.\n\nAlong those lines, how would you have fared if you\u2019d gotten in on Ethereum in its early days? How much would you have today if you\u2019d invested $1,000 at the launch of the second-most popular cryptocurrency?\n\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n\nEthereum, Then and Now\n\nIn July 2014, Ethereum held an initial coin offering (ICO), raising money for the project through Bitcoin. It worked like a crowdfunding project, where investors bought in (paying with Bitcoin) for early access.\n\nA year later, the actual Ether blockchain coins (ETH) started trading live at $0.31 per coin.\n\nAs of mid-April 2024, ETH trades at $3,157 per coin. That marks a roughly 10,000% increase in value.\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 at $0.31 per coin, you\u2019d have owned 3,225.81 ETH coins. At today\u2019s pricing, that would be worth $10,183,871.\n\nToday\u2019s pricing doesn\u2019t even represent Ether\u2019s peak. On November 9, 2021, ETH reached a dizzying $4,815. If you had cashed out your ETH coins at its zenith, you\u2019d have walked away with a cool $15,532,258.\n\nCrypto Halving\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies exist in ones and zeroes, rather than, say, physical gold and all the supply limitations attached to it, crypto creators must build in some type of scarcity.\n\nFor Bitcoin, that means halving the coins paid to miners for each block on a schedule of every 210,000 blocks. In fact, the next halving will likely have happened by the time this article publishes in mid-April.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether must add scarcity and limit production over time. But unlike Bitcoin, it does so with far more complexity. It does so through a \u201ctriple halving\u201d process including: fee burning, staking, and token issuance rate reduction. Read up on the Ether triple halving process for all the nerdy details.\n\nThat happens continuously, unlike the much-hyped halving events for Bitcoin. It produces the same result though: slowing new supply entering the market, to drive up values.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculation vs. Investing\n\nI opened by claiming that I \u201cinvest\u201d a little money in cryptocurrencies. The simple truth, however, is that I consider it speculating, not investing.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\n\nInvestments have intrinsic value. That value could come from its use, such as a home. Or it could come from revenue, in the case of a business or an apartment building. You can measure the investment\u2019s value based on that revenue, or based on comparable assets in the same market.\n\nCryptocurrencies don\u2019t produce revenue and have no tangible use. They\u2019re only worth wherever someone else is willing to pay for them, similar to collectibles like baseball cards or, dare I say it, non-fungible tokens (NFTs). To me, that makes them speculative.\n\nIs there an inherent value in a decentralized currency? I imagine so \u2014 but I have no idea what it might be, because there\u2019s nothing concrete to measure.\n\nBy all means, play around with money you can afford to lose in speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Just don\u2019t bet the farm on something that produces no revenue or measurable value.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Here\u2019s How Much a $1,000 Crypto Investment in Ethereum at Its Launch Would Be Worth Now"

        "title": "3 Must-Know Facts About Ethereum, Before You Buy the Cryptocurrency - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This top cryptocurrency is certainly on the radar of most investors.\n\nWith a current market cap (as of the afternoon of April 17) of $360 billion, Ethereum (ETH -1.03%) is the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency. It's behind only Bitcoin when it comes to market domination.\n\nJust in the past five years, Ethereum's native token has skyrocketed nearly 1,700% in value. That would have turned an initial $1,000 investment into a jaw-dropping $18,000 balance today.\n\nEthereum has also been on a fantastic run since the start of 2023, benefiting from the broader crypto market's rally. But this digital asset remains 36% off its high. Before you rush to buy the dip, here are three things you should know about Ethereum.\n\nAiming to boost functionality\n\nEthereum's key characteristic is that it allows for the functionality of smart contracts. These are computer programs that automatically execute once separate parties in a transaction satisfy their ends of the agreement. Think about an escrow account immediately releasing funds as soon as a home buyer meets certain conditions. In theory, Ethereum could handle this without human intervention, which could lower costs.\n\nThis feature is what makes this cryptocurrency much more useful when compared to Bitcoin, according to what Ethereum bulls believe. In fact, Ethereum has a sprawling ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from gaming and finance protocols to non-fungible tokens and the metaverse. Smart contracts enable these types of use cases, which could disrupt traditional industry structures.\n\nGiven this background knowledge, it's not surprising that Ethereum is often dubbed the \"world's decentralized computer.\"\n\nA sustainable future\n\nLike Bitcoin long has, Ethereum used to operate a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This is an energy-intensive way to process transactions and secure the blockchain. Estimates point to how Bitcoin's network uses the same amount of energy as a small country.\n\nBelieving that this was harmful to the environment and not on a sustainable path, Ethereum's developers successfully transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system in September 2022. After the so-called Merge, in this setup, token owners who lock up their holdings have the right to validate transactions. According to Ethereum's website, the PoS consensus mechanism reduces energy usage by over 99%.\n\nThe other hope for the PoS transition is that it'll make Ethereum a much faster and cheaper network. It can only handle 14 transactions per second. And when demand is high, fees can soar. In order for Ethereum to one day usher in multiple new use cases, as many hope it can, the throughput needs to increase. There are other planned upgrades in the pipeline to one day make this a reality.\n\nOngoing technical risk\n\nBesides the Merge, Ethereum's developers have four main updates planned in the future. Each one focuses on a specific area of improvement. The end goal is to have a fully functioning Ethereum network that is good for the environment, fast, cheap, and able to have a vast dApp ecosystem operating on top of it.\n\nOf all the cryptocurrencies in the world, Ethereum has the most developers working on it by far. This bodes well for its future because it means there are smart people focused on solving complex problems to keep progress going. I always say that I believe the ultimate success of a cryptocurrency depends on its ability to bring about real-world utility. Ethereum is trying to do this.\n\nThe issue, though, is that no matter how smart the upgrade pipeline looks on paper, it introduces immense technical risk. We can't forget that blockchain technology is still in the early innings. There is a lot that needs to be learned. Constantly tweaking and messing with the software means there will always be the possibility that something will break along the way.\n\nIf you are bullish on Ethereum, understanding these three key areas should help give you a better understanding before you put your money to work."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nNate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, has noted that the general consensus is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not going to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this May.\n\nThis is due to the lack of engagement with issuers over the past few weeks.\n\nEarlier this month, Barron's reported that discussions about spot ETFs have been \"very one-sided.\" This is very different from the constant \"back-and-forth\" that was observed on the cusp of the approval of multiple Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC was not willing to offer any feedback about Ethereum ETFs, meaning that their approval is highly unlikely as of now.\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, succinctly summarized that \"silence is violence\" when it comes to the SEC's interactions with potential issuers.\n\nAnother lawsuit?\n\nWith that being said, the SEC could potentially face another lawsuit if it rejects a slew of Ethereum ETF applications, according to Balchunas.\n\nBack in August, Grayscale managed to score a legal victory against the SEC, with the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruling that the regulator was wrong to shoot down its Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nGeraci now believes that Grayscale could bring another lawsuit against the SEC over its reluctance to approve Ethereum ETFs:\n\n\"Have to assume Grayscale, but some other enterprising ETF issuer w/ deep enough pockets could view this as a basic marketing expense\u2026Basically brand themself as \u201cpro-crypto\u201d & willing to go to bat for innovation,\" he said.\n\nDoes anyone care about Ethereum ETFs?\n\nSome have questioned the significance of spot Ethereum ETFs given that futures-based ETFs that track the value of the largest altcoin have attracted little attention.\n\nHowever, given the stunning success of Bitcoin ETFs, Geraci believes that Ethereum ETFs are still a big deal.\n\nEthereum's $379 billion market cap makes it a \"big enough deal\" for analysts and issuers to pay attention."

        "content": "Ethereum whale jumps on \u2018buy the dip\u2019 opportunity after Israel's attack on Iran.\n\nThe buyback yield of Ethereum exceeds that of major S&P 500 firms.\n\nEthereum may continue trading inside key range as investors await the market's response to Bitcoin halving.\n\nEthereum resumed its sideways movement on Friday after briefly crashing due to Israel's attack on Iran. The move presented a buying opportunity for a whale, who quickly profited from it. This also comes when Ethereum's buyback yield exceeds that of several S&P 500 firms.\n\nRead more: Ethereum shows firm support at key level as its correlation with US indices increase\n\nDaily digest market movers: Israel's retaliation, whale activity, buyback yields, Hong Kong's ETH ETF\n\nEthereum wasn't left out, as the entire crypto market took a hit on Friday following Israel's strike in retaliation to Iran's attack on April 13. Here are your key market movers:\n\nAs ETH dipped briefly on Friday, a whale jumped on the opportunity, spending 9.5 million USDT to buy 3,253 ETH at ~$ $2,925, according to crypto analytics platform Spot On Chain. However, ETH's price has quickly recovered, especially as Iranian officials have downplayed responding to the attack. As a result, the whale made nearly $625,000 in unrealized profit.\n\n\n\nEthereum is outshining major tech and financial giants in terms of buyback yields, according to Token Terminal. In a list of $200 billion+ finance and tech S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Alphabet and Berkshire Hathaway, Ethereum ranks number 16, above Tesla and JPMorgan with a buyback yield of 0.23%.\n\n\n\nBuyback for Ethereum, in this case, is implemented through token burns that began after The Merge in 2022. The number one smart contract blockchain achieved this feat in only nine years compared to the median age of 44 years of other companies in the list.\n\nETH buyback yield\n\nAlso read: Ethereum moves sideways as Q1 report indicates token burns are making it deflationary\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expressed doubts that Mainland China investors may not get access to Hong Kong's spot ETH ETFs when they start trading. This pessimism is based on China's ban on all crypto-related activities in 2021. However, other analysts have pointed to Hong Kong's positive reception to crypto investment as a good sign that spot ETH ETFs would see impressive inflows when they launch in the region.\n\n\n\nDespite ETH's brief price decline, ETH's long liquidations weren't heavy, sitting around $34.4 million in the past 24 hours. This may be due to heavy liquidations already seen earlier in the week.\n\nTechnical analysis: ETH may continue trading inside key range\n\nETH attempted to break the $2,852 support on Friday after Israel attacked Iran. However, prices have quickly bounced back, and ETH appears to be continuing its consolidation. The calm may be due to investors exercising caution as they await how the market responds to Bitcoin's fourth halving, which is a few hours away.\n\nRead more: Ethereum declines as crypto market crash increases bearish sentiment\n\nConsidering that many analysts have predicted that Bitcoin halving is already priced in, ETH may experience light volatility in the next few hours.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nBut in the coming weeks, it won't go outside the range of $2,852 and $3,406 formed in recent price movements, except if major external factors prevail on its price. In the long term, ETH could test the resistance of $3,730. An unlikely approval of spot ETH ETFs by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) would send it past the $4,000 key level to a new all-time high."

However, it\u2019s worth looking at the bigger picture too, with the same revealing that Ethereum\u2019s network has been doing really well, despite the recent price fluctuations.\n\nEthereum had a very positive Q1. In fact, Ethereum achieved a profit of $370 million from $825 million in revenue, equating to a net income margin of approximately 45%.\n\nEthereum revenue on the rise\n\nIf Ethereum was listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, it would lead the net income margin (%) rankings, with Microsoft, Adobe, and Veeva following closely. In terms of total profits across all publicly traded software companies, Ethereum would rank sixth.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s market capitalization stood at approximately $350 billion, placing it on par with tech giants such as Salesforce.\n\nHowever, there are significant caveats to consider here.\n\nEthereum\u2019s historical performance may not be as stellar, and its structure deviates from traditional corporations. Unlike a typical company, Ethereum\u2019s token functions as both a utility and a form of \u201cequity.\u201d Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s valuation is considerably higher than traditional software companies, when compared by revenue multiples.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nThe growth of Ethereum in Q1 and its potential for growth in the next quarter can help aid the bullish narrative around the network. Moreover, the revenue generated through L2s after the Dencun upgrade can also help the Ethereum network in terms of profitability.\n\nDespite all these favorable things happening for Ethereum, the price of ETH fell materially over the past week. It depreciated by over 11% and slipped past the $3,000-mark, before recovering again. However, the interest in ETH grew after this drastic decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that AMBCrypto\u2019s evaluation of Santiment\u2019s data revealed that even though the price of ETH recovered, its network growth flatlined.\n\nThis indicated that the number of new addresses interacting with ETH fell. A lack of interest from new addresses in ETH could affect the price movement of the altcoin significantly going forward."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a surge in Ethereum (ETH) price by 3.66% over the last 24 hours, reaching $3,175. This surge coincides with the reactivation of an ancient Ethereum wallet that had been dormant for nearly 8.7 years, according to data from the crypto tracker Whale Alert. The dormant wallet, holding 197 ETH valued at $622,685, has sparked intrigue and speculation within the crypto community.\n\nSpeculation Surrounding Dormant Wallet\u2019s Activation\n\nThe sudden awakening of the long-dormant Ethereum wallet has prompted speculation regarding its owner\u2019s identity and intentions. Some suggest the possibility of the owner rediscovering lost keys, while others speculate that it could be a strategic decision to \u201chodl\u201d until now. The wallet\u2019s anonymity adds to the mystery, with no clear indication of the early ETH adopter\u2019s identity or the reasons behind its prolonged dormancy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSome members of the crypto community speculate about potential market movements signaled by the activation of the dormant wallet. In contrast, others view it as a personal decision by an individual or entity. Despite these speculations, the exact reasons behind the wallet\u2019s sudden awakening remain undisclosed, leaving the mystery surrounding it largely unsolved for now.\n\nAs Ethereum regained the $3,000 price mark, on-chain sources reported a significant withdrawal of 10,119 ETH worth $31.83 million from Binance. Withdrawals of this magnitude are often interpreted as a signal of intent to buy within the market. The whale behind the withdrawal has been actively accumulating ETH, purchasing 127,388 ETH worth $405.19 million from decentralized exchanges (DEX) and Binance since April 8. This activity indicates a bullish sentiment towards Ethereum, with the whale consistently buying at an average price of approximately $3,172.\n\nICO Participant Sells Ethereum Holdings\n\nIn a recent development, Coingape reported on an Ethereum whale who acquired ETH during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) phase and subsequently sold a portion of their holdings. The whale, who initially acquired 33,213 ETH during Ethereum\u2019s Genesis ICO in 2015, has deposited 5,110 ETH to Kraken or sold via DEX at an approximate price of $2,545. Despite this sell-off, the whale still retains a significant amount of ETH, holding approximately 29.7K ETH valued at $89.4 million across three wallets, primarily within staking platforms.\n\nRead Also: XRP Lawyer Bill Morgan Criticizes SEC: Questions $2B Ripple Settlement\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

After all the hype surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s halving, BTC hit a bump on the road, falling by 2.31% in just 24 hours. This, despite the Bitcoin ETF market noting such a significant change. After five days of outflows, there was a sudden influx of positive net inflows right before the day of the halving.\n\nIn fact, according to Farside Investors\u2019 data, five out of 10 ETFs recorded positive inflows totaling $59.7 million.\n\nThis underlined the growing confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s pre-halving and post-halving performance among investors in the ETF space.\n\nExpansion of ETFs leading to crypto-mainstream adoption\n\nDiscussing the potential expansion of the crypto-ETF space beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH], Sergey Nazarov, Co-founder of Chainlink, in a recent interview claimed,\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s next is more ETFs about coins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, I think the ETF dynamic is going to continue during this year and just grow and grow and grow.\u201d\n\nHis comments highlighted the potential for ETFs to drive broader adoption of digital assets and advance the mainstream integration of Web3 technologies.\n\nHere, it\u2019s worth noting that in a separate interview, Anthony Scaramucci, Founder of SkyBridge Capital, also chipped in on the subject.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is on an adoption curve.\u201d\n\nHe added,\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t see this inflation hedge, or a store of value as other pundits are saying until you get over a billion users. So, right now it\u2019s gonna be way more volatile than the people like.\u201d\n\nAll eyes on Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nOn the back of Hong Kong\u2019s recent approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, positive steps are being taken towards mainstream adoption. However, while U.S-based ETFs have accumulated nearly $60 billion in assets since their launch, Hong Kong\u2019s new ETFs\u2019 success projections vary.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently commented,\n\n\u201cOther countries adding BTC ETFs is no doubt additive, but it\u2019s nickel-dime compared to the mighty U.S market.\u201d\n\nAll this leads us to a question \u2013 Will the SEC reject the spot Ethereum ETF applications?\n\nIn response to the aforementioned question, Hashkey Capital\u2019s Head of Research Jupiter Zheng, responded,\n\n\u201cIf the ETF is denied, it will not be that bearish, as the market is not pricing in it yet. And, we still have Bitcoin ETFs as the entrance for traditional funds.\u201d\n\nWhat dictates entry into the crypto-market though? Well, according to Nazarov, adoption does.\n\nAccording to the exec, to address concerns about mainstream adoption, the crypto-industry must focus on enhancing usability, scalability, connectivity, and privacy. Improvements in these areas would not only attract broader adoption, but also drive the industry forward by pushing its boundaries, he concluded."

        "content": "Exchange outflows hit a yearly high, suggesting bullish conviction.\n\nETH\u2019s price may find it challenging to surpass $3,255 in the short term.\n\nUnknown to many, Ethereum [ETH] registered its highest exchange outflows in 2024 on the 18th of April. On this date, market participants withdrew 143,000 ETH from platforms, per CryptoQuant.\n\nExchange outflow is a sign of unwillingness to sell, suggesting that the altcoin might not experience a severe capitulation. The last time ETH witnessed such was on the 7th of February and the 26th of March.\n\nWhen the accumulation happened in February, ETH\u2019s price was $2,372, and by the end of the month, the value of the cryptocurrency was $3,386.\n\nBut the outflow in March did not bring the same result as the price fell later. However, AMBCrypto found that there were reasons the outflow jumped.\n\nDogged holders keep the faith\n\nOne of them is the rising enthusiasm that the U.S. SEC would approve Ethereum ETFs by May. While some participants were convinced that approval would happen, some skeptics thought otherwise.\n\nBurakkesmeci, an author on CryptoQuant, also seemed to agree with the viewpoint, mentioning that,\n\n\u201cWe witnessed a significant amount of BTC leaving exchanges before the Bitcoin spot ETF approval. I can\u2019t say the same is happening, but we should keep this possibility in mind.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the rise could be linked to the belief that ETH\u2019s price is destined to outperform Bitcoin [BTC] this cycle. While this school of thought remains unfounded, AMBCrypto checked the LTH-NUPL.\n\nLTH-NUPL is an acronym for Long Term Holder \u2014 Net Unrealized Profit/Loss. This metric shows the behavior of holders who have held the cryptocurrency for at least 155 days.\n\nAs of this writing, the LTH-NUPL was in the optimistic (yellow) region, despite moving closer to the euphoria side earlier. But that has not had a significant impact on the value.\n\nETH targets a lower low\n\nAt press time, EHT changed hands at $3,175, representing a 3.67% increase in the last 24 hours. From a technical point of view, momentum around the token increased.\n\nThis was evident in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) whose reading was 58.64. Typically, this is supposed to bring about a further increase in the price action.\n\nHowever, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) showed a different signal. As of this writing, the 20 EMA (blue) was above the 50 EMA (yellow), indicating a bearish trend.\n\nIn addition, the Supertrend flashed a sell signal at $3,255. Therefore, if the cryptocurrency\u2019s price keeps appreciating, it could face rejection at the aforementioned price.\n\nRead Ethereum [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nLike the Supertrend, the Money Flow Index (MFI) also displayed a bearish sign. With its downtrend, the MFI indicated that capital flowed out from the ETH market.\n\nAs such, the price could fail to break through the resistance at $3,500."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s on-chain metric flashed a bullish sign on the charts\n\nHowever, key technical indicators suggested that the coin\u2019s price may fall further.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] Age Consumed metric climbed to a one-month high on 18 April. This rally was followed by a slight uptick in the altcoin\u2019s value too, suggesting that a local bottom might have been hit, according to Santiment\u2019s data.\n\nIs the bottom in or not?\n\nTo assess whether a price bottom is in, it is important to assess ETH\u2019s Age Consumed metric. This metric tracks the movement of its long-held idle coins. It is regarded as a good marker for local tops and bottoms because long-term holders rarely move their dormant coins around. Therefore, whenever this happens, it often results in major shifts in market trends.\n\nWhenever this metric spikes, it indicates that a significant number of previously held idle tokens have begun to change hands. It hints at a strong shift in the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nOn the other hand, when an asset\u2019s Age Consumed dips, it means that long-held coins remain in wallet addresses without being traded.\n\nIn fact, according to Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s Age Consumed rose to a high of 1.6 million on 18 April. Although ETH\u2019s price briefly fell below $3,000 after this, it quickly rebounded to exchange hands at $3,059 at press time.\n\nSince 18 April, the crypto\u2019s value has risen by 3%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhy caution is necessary\n\nWhile ETH\u2019s Age Consumed hinted at the possibility of an uptrend, an assessment of the coin\u2019s price movements on the 1-day chart revealed that the short-term outlook remains significantly bearish.\n\nUnderlining that bearish power exceeded bullish activity in ETH\u2019s market, its positive directional index (green) rested under its negative index (red).\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhen these lines of an asset\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) are positioned this way, it is a sign that the market trend is bearish and the price is under significant pressure from the sellers.\n\nAdditionally, readings from the ETH market\u2019s moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator confirmed the prevailing bearish trend, with the MACD line below its signal and zero lines.\n\nWhen these lines are positioned this way, it indicates a strong bearish trend in the market and confirms the possibility of a further decline in an asset\u2019s price.\n\nMarket participants often see it as a signal to exit long positions and take short ones. Simply put, it might be a tricky time to navigate Ethereum\u2019s market right now."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has recently experienced notable volatility amid market price fluctuations. Despite this uncertain environment, Ethereum aims to maintain its price above the crucial $3,000 support zone.\n\nPart of the volatility can be attributed to increased whale activity involving ETH, as significant amounts of the token are being transferred to exchanges. For instance, Whale Alert data on April 20 indicated that 10,911 ETH, valued at approximately $33.52 million, was transferred to Coinbase.\n\nSuch large movements to major exchanges like Coinbase raise concerns about sustained volatility in Ethereum\u2019s price, especially considering the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset\u2019s susceptibility to overall market bearish sentiments.\n\nCurrently, ETH is trading at $3,062.73, having corrected by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours. On the daily chart, Ethereum dipped to a low of $2,900 before experiencing a brief uptick.\n\nMeanwhile, on the weekly chart, ETH is down over 6%. Amidst this volatility, the primary focus is on how Ethereum\u2019s valuation will evolve in the coming days.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nEthereum price AI prediction\n\nEthereum is teetering just above the $3,000 zone, a critical juncture, as losing this level could trigger a further downward trajectory. Seeking insights into Ethereum\u2019s potential future movements, Finbold turned to predictions from artificial intelligence (AI) machine algorithm models at CoinCodex.\n\nAccording to data retrieved on April 20, Ethereum is projected to trade at $3,117.08 on May 1, representing an increase of approximately 1.7% from its current valuation.\n\nETH prediction, May 1, 2024. Source: CoinCodex\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that May has significant regulatory implications for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to decide on approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nShould this product receive approval, its potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics remains uncertain. It will be crucial to monitor whether it will echo the precedent set by similar ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH\u2019s key support zone to watch\n\nAmid ongoing uncertainty surrounding Ethereum\u2019s price, crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautioned on April 16 that should ETH continue a downward trend, investors should closely monitor the critical support zone between $2,000 and $2,430.\n\nWithin this range, approximately 9.37 million addresses hold nearly 53 million ETH. A breach of this support zone could potentially intensify selling pressure and exacerbate the downturn.\n\nETH money in/out chart. Source: IntoTheBlock/ali_charts\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s technical indicators remain predominantly bearish. A summary of the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicates a \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 13, with similar sentiments reflected in moving averages and oscillators at 10 and 3, respectively.\n\nEthereum technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn conclusion, despite prevailing bearish sentiments surrounding Ethereum, the asset stands to benefit from any bullish resurgence in the broader market, likely driven by the aftermath of the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
