        "title": "Ethereum faces a moment of truth with latest crypto rally - Fortune",
        "content": "In early December, the sudden popularity of a new species of NFT called Buterin Cards led Ethereum gas fees\u2014the cost to carry out a transaction on the blockchain\u2014to briefly soar to around $10. Even though the fees soon fell back to around $1, the episode was an unpleasant reminder of earlier crypto booms when Ethereum became practically unusable just as it was soaring in popularity. This famously occurred with the arrival of an early NFT package known as Crypto Kitties in 2017, and with the massive speculative frenzy of the 2021 crypto bubble.\n\nDuring those earlier episodes, Ethereum boosters begged for understanding since the blockchain, which was the first to popularize smart contracts, was still a new technology. The crypto world was largely understanding since growing pains for a project of this scale are inevitable, and due to the specific challenge of the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d\u2014an axiom that says it is easy to build for two of the three qualities of speed, security, and decentralization but not all three. As we appear to be entering a new crypto bull market, though, it\u2019s not clear if people will be as patient.\n\nThe frustration around gas fees is partly a financial one\u2014no one likes to pay more than they expect. But it\u2019s also rooted in a philosophical disconnect: The promise of Ethereum is that it\u2019s supposed to be a cheaper and safer technology than the conventional financial system. The reality for many people who first try Ethereum, however, is that the proposed gas cost exceeds the cost of the underlying transaction.\n\nI asked Paul Brody, an Ernst & Young executive who has written a well-reviewed book titled Ethereum for Business, to see if he is concerned that the blockchain\u2019s ongoing gas headaches might mean it is running out of time to prove it is ready for primetime. He told me he is not, pointing to the flourishing layer-2 ecosystem, which lets users carry out the bulk of transactions on auxiliary blockchains like Optimism at a fraction of the cost. Those transactions are then bundled up and stamped on the main Ethereum blockchain, providing the same immutable record.\n\nLayer-2 technology has indeed grown by leaps and bounds since 2021, spurred in part by Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to a proof-of-stake model for its blockchain, and costs on the side chains are far lower. But as I pointed to Brody, the experience of using a layer-2 chain is still clumsy and complicated, and off-putting to nontechnical people.\n\nBrody acknowledged that the L2 experience remains \u201cabsolutely horrible\u201d but says this is only a temporary situation, and that it won\u2019t be long until it becomes abstracted away with better designs. Meanwhile, he added that Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract for companies by an order of magnitude, and that this growth will only continue\u2014a refutation of claims by Solana and other rivals that tout their lower gas costs as proof they can replace Ethereum.\n\nFor now, Brody appears right that Ethereum remains in the pole position when it comes to being the world\u2019s go-to smart contract platform. That said, if the next crypto boom is once again defined by eye-popping Ethereum fees, patience will begin to run out.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe SEC asked a Washington, D.C., court to incorporate admissions included in Binance's recent settlement with the DOJ, claiming they strengthen its ongoing case.

        "title": "Ethereum ETF: How BlackRock's Proposal Affects Crypto's Outlook - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "At $9.4 trillion in assets under management, U.S. investment behemoth BlackRock Inc. (ticker: BLK) is the largest money manager in the world.\n\nJust about all of that money percolates in traditional financial market channels, like stock, bonds, funds, currencies, derivatives, real estate and commodities. For years, nary a word was spoken (to the masses, at least) about BlackRock steering mountains of cash into cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nBut if you look closely, hints have been dropped about the investment firm's rising interest in crypto in the past few years.\n\nA case in point: In November 2020, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said Bitcoin had the potential to \"take the place of gold to a large extent.\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also weighed in on crypto, noting that original crypto Bitcoin (BTC) was resonating with the public and may one day create its own global market. In December 2020, BlackRock left another crypto clue, advertising for a vice president of blockchain who would ostensibly drive \"strategies designed to drive demand for the firm's offerings.\"\n\nBlackRock's Bid for a Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nSponsored Crypto Exchanges 1 Gemini Account Minimum $0 Fee 0.2% Maker Fee / 0.4% Taker Fee Gemini is well-suited for crypto traders of any skill level and available in all 50 states. Sign up and trade to get $10 in bitcoin. Open An Account 2 Kraken Account Minimum $10 Fee 0% to 0.4% Easy, Fast, Secure Crypto Trading of 200+ Cryptocurrencies. Made for Beginners and Experts Alike. Open An Account View Disclosure 3 Coinbase Account Minimum $0 Fee 0% - 3.99% Get up to $200 in crypto. Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nBlackRock announced in November 2023 that it filed for a spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund, and with that action the company's cryptocurrency vision has begun to crystalize. After all, it wouldn't roll out a new crypto ETF if it didn't believe in the market where it operates, would it?\n\nBlackRock is not the only horse in the race for the first spot Ethereum ETF, however. Asset manager Grayscale Investments, which recently won a landmark legal victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to move a spot Bitcoin ETF into fruition, is also pursuing a spot Ethereum ETF. On Dec. 5, the SEC gave itself an extension to reach a decision or extend the deadline for the ETH ETF until January 2024.\n\nBlackRock filed for its iShares Ethereum Trust to be listed on the Nasdaq and proposes to turn it into a spot ETF. Days later, Fidelity put in its own application for a spot Ethereum ETF, and at least five other top investment houses are now also in the running.\n\nThe SEC has yet to give the nod to either a spot Bitcoin or a spot Ethereum ETF, which would directly own Bitcoin and Ether rather than futures tied to the cryptos. There are several popular ETFs already in existence linked to cryptocurrency futures.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Appears Poised for Approval\n\nBlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF application is also in the works, as are talks between the SEC, Grayscale, Fidelity and others that have filed spot Bitcoin ETFs and progressed into a discussion of technical details, an indication that they may soon be approved, according to a Dec. 7 Reuters report.\n\nWhat's not as clear is what these high-profile entries into the market mean for cryptocurrency investors, prices, and public policy risk and regulation oversight.\n\nIndustry investment experts say that it should mean a shot in the arm for crypto in the short term \u2013 and maybe a lot more.\n\n\"Companies like BlackRock recognize the potential for market growth and the opportunity to profit from it,\" says Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payments platform Mercuryo. \"Consequently, they aim to be the first to penetrate the market and secure an advantage. Moreover, they already possess the necessary infrastructure, funds and investors to succeed and influence the further development of the crypto industry, given their heavy weight in the financial industry.\"\n\nEven more significantly, BlackRock's Ethereum ETF move could be seen as a new phase in the crypto industry's evolution. \"Large institutional investment funds are entering the market, prepared to invest their clients' money and influence the market's direction,\" Berker says.\n\n\"The foray of institutional giants like BlackRock into the crypto market signifies the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies as an asset class,\" says Nic Puckrin, CEO and co-founder of Coin Bureau, a cryptocurrency education platform. \"This strategic interest from large capital allocators signals a positive endorsement of the crypto industry, highlighting its growing acceptance and recognizing its potential for traditional hedge funds and investors.\"\n\n\n\nHow Would a Spot Ethereum ETF Impact Markets?\n\nWho benefits the most and who absorbs the largest risk regarding BlackRock's proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF? While nothing is guaranteed in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market, here's an \"impact\" list:\n\nImplications for the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nCrypto industry experts say BlackRock's potential introduction of a spot Ethereum ETF should drive the market forward significantly. BlackRock and Fidelity applying for spot crypto ETFs, as opposed to crypto futures ETFs, sends a message to the financial world that cryptocurrencies as an investment vehicle have matured to the point that established institutions feel comfortable diving in.\n\nIf a BlackRock or Fidelity spot crypto ETF rolls out, the floodgates could open, allowing billions of dollars of new capital to have access to this uncorrelated asset class. So, in short, prices could go up.\n\nEffect on Cryptocurrency Risk\n\nWhile it's no secret that cryptocurrency is volatile, having the BlackRock brand and other big names in the crypto market should provide some price stability, experts say, as the relatively small pool of crypto owners expands to give access to more people.\n\nIn the case of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, for example, Galaxy Research estimates that the addressable market size would be roughly $14 trillion in the first year after its launch, reaching $39 trillion by its third year. That's a lot more crypto investors having a much bigger hand in the direction of assets.\n\nImpact on Cryptocurrency Prices\n\nCrypto experts generally view the BlackRock ETF play as a positive one across the board, price-wise.\n\n\"We can expect major cryptocurrency prices to spike in the short term,\" says Habeeb Syed, an associate attorney at Sutter Law PC, which regularly services blockchain clients. \"Medium to long term, expect sustained increases in BTC and ETH with the normal consequential rises in other crypto as the market sees an influx of value based on the two major cryptocurrencies.\"\n\nThat rise has already started, as Bitcoin's price popped above $44,000 late last week, and retreated just below $42,000 as of the morning of Dec. 11.\n\nOther professional cryptocurrency trackers concur, noting the \"trust\" issue leans toward the market with a BlackRock presence.\n\n\"Although we don't like to speculate on price action, we do believe that the crypto ETFs will have a positive impact on the industry and market overall,\" says Nathan Leung, a crypto educator and lead content creator at Cryptonauts, a YouTube platform that covers blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\nA stable level of trust from retail investors is extremely important because they are the key to mass adoption, Leung notes.\n\n\"Everyone has heard of crypto at this point, including your aunt and grandmother at family gatherings,\" he says. \"But their perception of crypto varies, and the sentiment is mostly negative surrounding our industry. An ETF approval would boost the level of trust immensely, having a domino effect on the rest of the market.\"\n\nWhat Risk Is BlackRock Taking With a Spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nThe biggest risk BlackRock faces is their ETF investors thinking they can stomach a 50% drawdown but then getting squeamish and pulling out at the bottom, causing negative sentiment toward BlackRock and the asset class as a whole, experts say.\n\nHowever, BlackRock entering the fold may mark a level of maturity for the industry, limiting future drawdowns to normal percentages akin to real estate investment trusts and small-cap stocks.\n\nWhat a Spot Ethereum ETF Means for the Second-Largest Crypto\n\nOften languishing in the shadow of Bitcoin, Ethereum could find its time to shine, but there are caveats.\n\n\"Ethereum is just the next big thing after Bitcoin and one of the assets in the space least likely to be classified as a security given its decentralized nature and active and widespread use,\" Syed says. \"If you're putting in the time and money to start an ETF, you don't want those efforts wiped out by a surprise SEC ruling.\"\n\nYet, with a green light from regulators, Ethereum could significantly benefit from its Fidelity or BlackRock ETF connection.\n\n\"Ethereum, the second-largest and most widely recognized cryptocurrency following Bitcoin, presents a valuable platform for BlackRock to enter this market,\" Berker says. \"Beyond its recognition, Ethereum provides substantial liquidity.\"\n\nThat means investment funds can purchase Ether in advance to establish a liquid reserve. \"When they decide to act, this reserve guarantees a robust market for transactions, offering an advantage over other altcoins,\" Berker notes.\n\nImpact of Spot Crypto ETFs on Everyday Investors\n\nBig moves from big investment firms have a ripple effect on Main Street investors, and BlackRock's new Ethereum ETF should be no different.\n\nAs with any investment, retail investors should keep a cool head if a spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF goes live. \"While the news about ETF approval will positively affect the development of the crypto market, it is also vital to consider the progression and continuity of such news,\" Berker says.\n\nMany investors will understandably assume that after a spot ETF has been approved, the price will be going up. But that's not necessarily the case."

        "title": "Ethereum burns $2.5B worth of ETH since merge as supply drops to 18 month low - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Analysis of Ethereum\u2019s recent financial data on Ultrasound Money reveals a continued shift in its economic model since the historic merge in Sept. 2022.\n\nThe decline in Ethereum\u2019s supply stands at 309,663 ETH, equivalent to approximately $686.2 million. This reduction reflects a deflationary trend, contrasting the previous inflationary nature where new ETH was consistently created. The cause of this shift can be traced to the burning of 1,195,238 ETH, valued at around $2.65 billion. Permanently removing tokens from circulation plays a crucial role in reducing the total supply and could enhance ETH\u2019s scarcity and value over time. Further, despite the issuance of 885,581 ETH, worth about $1.96 billion, Ethereum\u2019s total supply experienced a net decrease, illustrating that the rate of ETH burning continues to surpass the rate of new issuance.\n\nPresently, the total supply of Ethereum stands at the lowest point since the merge at 120,211,380 ETH, translating to a market capitalization of approximately $266.39 billion, reinforcing its significant standing in the crypto market.\n\nA look at the ETH burning leaderboard presents further insights by analyzing the leading contracts contributing to the burning of ETH. The top contributors to this activity include major dApps and services, notably Uniswap in its various iterations, Tether, and OpenSea. Uniswap\u2019s prominent position suggests a high transaction volume within the DeFi sector, with $543.8 million burned across four contracts in the top 10.\n\nThe presence of Tether indicates substantial stablecoin transactions on Ethereum\u2019s network, while OpenSea\u2019s inclusion highlights the enduring nature of NFT transactions even through the bear market. This diversity, encompassing DeFi platforms, stablecoins, NFT marketplaces, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, showcases the multifaceted utilization of Ethereum.\n\nBurned ETH Entity Value (USD) 84,006.46 Uniswap Universal Router $186,158,315.36 75,926.77 Uniswap V2 $168,253,722.32 74,739.31 ETH transfers $165,622,310.96 58,030.71 Uniswap Universal Router 2 $128,596,053.36 53,626.72 Tether $118,836,811.52 27,441.92 Uniswap V3 $60,811,294.72 26,935.76 New contracts $59,689,644.16 23,405.50 OpenSea $51,866,588.00 22,891.92 Arbitrum $50,728,494.72 22,201.66 MetaMask $49,198,878.56\n\nSource: ultrasound.money\n\nThe top 10 contracts total $1,039,762,113.68 worth of ETH burned, just under half of the total burn since the merge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s transition to a deflationary model may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value, especially when contrasted with inflationary fiat currencies. The heightened activity in decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications indicates a robust trend toward decentralized finance.\n\nInterestingly, under its current proof-of-stake (PoS) model, the Ethereum network has burned an average of 1.83 ETH/min since the merge. However, since the burn mechanic was implemented as part of the EIP-1559 upgrade in Aug. 2021, the average burn rate is almost double, 3.09 ETH/min. Yet, due to the drastic reduction in supply issuance since proof-of-work mining was removed, the total supply has steadily declined.\n\nIf Ethereum had retained its PoW mode, the supply would have reached a mammoth 124,941,176 ETH, some 4.7 million ETH more than the current level. Theoretically, at the current price of $2,228, this would have given Ethereum a market cap of $12 billion higher than current $266 billion. Importantly, due to the increased supply, this is merely academic due to the nature of supply/demand market dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, these dynamics may influence Ethereum\u2019s trajectory in various ways. Continued deflationary tendencies could lead to increased demand and potentially higher ETH prices, assuming steady or rising demand coming out of the bear market. However, it\u2019s essential to consider that market volatility and external factors like regulatory changes or macroeconomic trends can significantly impact these dynamics, especially with continued activity from the SEC in the U.S. toward categorizing PoS tokens as securities.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum\u2019s post-merge statistics signal a notable move towards a deflationary framework, underscored by high network usage, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, and the potential for heightened value due to diminishing supply. However, these trends warrant continued analysis and understanding of macroeconomic factors to comprehend their long-term impact and sustainability fully.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) tokenizes ethereum stocks in its CSD - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "Today SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) announced it has tokenized the shares of a private company Aktionariat AG in its blockchain-based central securities depository (CSD). The tokenized shares had already been issued on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point?\n\nWhile tokenizing securities should improve liquidity, today that\u2019s often not the case. Part of the issue is the fragmentation of investor pools. You have crypto-savvy investors who are comfortable investing in public blockchain tokens. And you have institutions where sometimes that\u2019s not the case.\n\nBy tokenizing the stocks in a central securities depository, you can have the best of both worlds. Crypto-savvy investors can buy the stocks directly on Ethereum. And institutional investors and brokers can can access the stock via a CSD, in a similar way to how they usually access stocks and other securities.\n\nBerner Kantonalbank (BEKB) acted as the issuer agent and custodian. Aktionariat was eating its own dog food, given its business is helping companies to tokenize their stocks.\n\n\u201cWith this transaction, the involved players from the traditional finance world are proving that they are open to the integration of assets that were originally issued on an open, permissionless blockchain,\u201d said Nicola Plain, CEO of Aktionariat. \u201cAn important step towards building a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance.\u201d\n\nThis particular transaction was more of a pilot. The three companies now plan to explore commercializing the concept.\n\nIt also aligns with SDX\u2019s strategy to engage with private market ecosystem partners and the Swiss SME investor community,\u201d said Alexandre Kech, Head Digital Securities at SDX.\n\nMulti blockchain tokens \u2013 some takeaways\n\nThis sort of solution raises a few questions. If the two records got out of sync, which one would be legally valid? We\u2019re assuming the CSD but it\u2019s a question worth asking.\n\nIt leads to another issue we\u2019ve raised before. Companies generally have one system where they record their capitalization table. So far, most securities issuances have been on a single blockchain. But that is unlikely to be the case in the future. We\u2019re not talking about this example, where in theory the same issuances are mirrored.\n\nConsider stablecoin issuers such as Tether and Circle. They issue stablecoins on several public blockchains. Stock issuers might choose to do likewise. Franklin Templeton has launched its government money market fund on multiple blockchains. The Franklin Templeton case is a little different because the U.S. SEC requires a separate traditional database as the definitive record.\n\nMeanwhile, Korea\u2019s CSD is building a solution to support multiple blockchain security token issuance.\n\nAlso when you start involving the regulatory sector, there\u2019s a good chance that banks could hold the stocks on their balance sheet. That triggers the Basel banking rules. The Basel Committee is not too keen on public blockchain and seems to want to treat tokenized public blockchain securities like crypto. Given in this SDX case there is a CSD, would they be treated as public blockchain? If the CSD is the definitive record, does it matter that they are also issued on a public blockchain?\n\nOver time these sorts of issues will become clearer."

        "content": "Homepage > News > Editorial > Digital currency\u2019s Titanic: Ethereum\u2019s sinking ship of flawed technology exposed\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nMuch like the Titanic setting sail with fanfare and promise, Ethereum emerged on the digital currency scene as a beacon of blockchain innovation. With its smart contracts and decentralized applications, it promised to revolutionize finance and create a decentralized internet.\n\nHowever, as we delve beneath the surface, like the iceberg that sank the Titanic, Ethereum\u2019s technical and security flaws lurk ominously, threatening to sink investors\u2019 hopes and funds into the icy abyss of financial despair.\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical flaws\n\nScalability issues\n\nEthereum (ETH) advocates often boast about its transition to Ethereum 2.0, heralding it as the solution to the network\u2019s long-standing scalability woes. However, Ethereum 2.0 grapples with fundamental scaling limitations even with a new genesis block\u200b\u200b.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with ETH\u2019s scalability issues, notably a low transaction throughput of around five transactions per second. This limitation has been acknowledged even by the project\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin\u200b\u200b.\n\nSlow transaction speeds\n\nThe scalability problem is exacerbated during high-traffic periods, making Ethereum less capable of handling increased load during bull markets\u200b.\n\nEthereum\u2019s defenders may argue that its slower transaction speeds are a trade-off for better security. However, these slow speeds, especially during high network demand, hamper its usability for real-time applications, creating a bottleneck that\u2019s hard to overlook.\n\nHigh gas fees\n\nThe argument that high gas fees are a measure of Ethereum\u2019s popularity and network usage falls flat when these fees devour small investors\u2019 funds, making many transactions unfeasible.\n\nYour system simply can\u2019t support microtransactions if the fees cost 10,000% more than the amount you want to send.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nSmart contract vulnerabilities\n\nDespite the many smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, security flaws have led to significant financial losses, undermining the ecosystem\u2019s stability\u200b\u200b. Ethereum bagholders might argue that these are growing pains, but the recurring issues highlight a systemic problem.\n\nSeth Green, the actor and creator of \u201cRobot Chicken,\u201d faced a significant setback when his Bored Ape NFT #8398, crucial for his upcoming animated series \u201cWhite Horse Tavern,\u201d was stolen in a phishing attack. The NFT, named Fred Simian in the series, was to be the main character. Green, who had developed the show around this NFT for over a year, was forced into a complex situation involving legal rights and ownership issues. Eventually, he paid an additional 165 ETH (about $260,000) to retrieve the NFT.\n\nMeanwhile, BSV blockchain\u2019s re-enabled smart contracting shows promise with potentially better security provisions and could bypass the pitfalls that have plagued Ethereum.\n\n51% attack threat\n\nThe switch to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, as Ethereum advocates argue, is to reduce energy consumption. However, this switch exposes Ethereum to new security issues, making it more vulnerable than its Proof of Work (PoW) predecessor.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s tried-and-tested PoW mechanism continues to provide robust security, a feature Ethereum traded for short-term narrative benefits, thus potentially putting investor funds at risk.\n\nLack of privacy\n\nWhile providing transparency, Ethereum\u2019s open ledger system and account-based model expose user transactions to the public eye. Advocates may argue this transparency is a boon, but with one wallet for everything, the trade-off in privacy can have profound implications.\n\nActor and comedian Bill Murray\u2019s digital currency wallet, used to sell official NFTs inspired by his life, was once attacked following a charity auction. The attack resulted in a loss of $174,000 from his wallet.\n\nBlockchain solutions using the UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) model offer better privacy measures while maintaining transparency, providing a more balanced approach to user privacy and security.\n\nThe vaporware concern\n\nEthereum\u2019s repeated failure to deliver on its scaling promises, even with Ethereum 2.0, raises concerns about it being glamourized vaporware, with fundamental design flaws inhibiting its progress\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe mirage of a fully scalable and secure Ethereum continues to elude its developers, casting a long, chilling shadow on crypto\u2019s future, much like the Titanic\u2019s voyage cut short by an unforeseen disaster.\n\nAs Ethereum sails through the stormy seas of the digital currency world, the iceberg of technical and security flaws looms large. Buterin\u2019s ship is steered by a narrative that does not hold water when scrutinized closely.\n\nCompetition and conclusion\n\nThe watershed moment has already begun with the advent of Ordinals, as BTC increasingly sees more NFT sales volume daily than ETH and Solana combined. This trend will only continue with the wave of fungible tokens on BTC.\n\nAdditionally, the recent introduction of BitVM is a noteworthy advancement. By allowing smart contracts without altering BTC\u2019s consensus rules and eliminating the need for a hard fork, BitVM could significantly expand the scope and capabilities of BTC.\n\nMeanwhile, as Xiaohui Liu notes, sCrypt is literally \u201ca development platform for smart contracts\u201d on Bitcoin. These developments have led to a broader range of applications and use cases, making Bitcoin a more versatile and powerful blockchain than Ethereum.\n\nBefore boarding digital currency\u2019s Titanic, investors ought to eye the lifeboats of alternative, more seaworthy vessels. The digital ocean is vast, and while Ethereum may have launched with promise, the icebergs in its path pose a threat too significant to ignore.\n\nIn stark contrast, the BSV blockchain has shattered records, boasting thousands of times more throughput capability than Ethereum\u2019s.\n\nThanks to its unbounded scalability, the BSV network handles thousands of transactions per second. With the BSV blockchain, smart contracts run with transaction fees that are 1000x cheaper than Ethereum, showcasing a more economically viable platform.\n\nHow long can the market stay irrational?\n\nThis article introduces a new series, FUDslinging: Facts, Uncertainty, and Doubt. In my next column, I\u2019ll uncover what the small block maximalists and laser eyes don\u2019t want you to know about the BTC Lightning Network (RIP).\n\nFollow CoinGeek\u2019s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups\u2014from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple, Ethereum,\n\nFTX and Tether\u2014who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for na\u00efve (and even experienced) players in the market."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin fell below $41,000 and Ethereum below $2,200 on Monday as crypto markets took a dive after having rallied for the better part of two months.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $40,758, down 7% in the past day. This is after the market already saw $330 million in crypto futures contracts liquidated on Monday morning as BTC fell below $43,000. Total liquidations have now reached $516 million, according to CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the 1-day dip is relative. It's still 5% higher than it was at the start of the month, when BTC was changing hands for $38,688. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has lost 7% since yesterday and is currently trading for $2,185. That's 7% higher than what it started the month at, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization, which has hovered around $1 trillion for the better part of the year, now sits at $1.6 trillion\u2014down 6% since yesterday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElsewhere in the market, alts were taking a beating. ORDI (ORDI), which last week saw explosive growth and set an all-time high of $68.37, has slumped 14% in the past day. The token, easily the most popular BRC-20 token built on Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol, is now trading for $45.11.\n\nPepecoin (PEPE), which last week jumped 26% during a spike in meme coin activity, has also cooled off. As of this writing, it has fallen 13% in the last day and is trading for $0.00000138.\n\nEven as the some of the largest digital assets by market cap take a hit, there's been good news for some alts.\n\nA new report from digital asset manager CoinShares finds that institutional investors have been especially keen on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). Exchange-traded products meant to track the two coins saw $5 million worth of deposits last week. And while most of the gaming token category went red on Monday, Immutable (IMX) saw a 10% gain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD)\u2014a dollar-pegged stablecoin\u2014lost its peg for a while on Monday. As of this writing, BUSD had dropped as low as $0.97, according to CoinGecko. Even though it's a defunct stablecoin, there are still roughly 1.4 billion of the tokens in circulation.\n\nOne possible reason for the price turbulence: Most BUSD margin trading and futures contracts were automatically closed today, according to a Binance blog post.\n\nBUSD has been on a steady decline since the SEC sent a Wells Notice to New York-based firm Paxos, which used to handle minting and redemptions of BUSD on behalf of crypto exchange Binance. In the aftermath, Paxos and Binance said that users could continue to redeem their tokens until February 2024.\n\nThe exchange said BUSD tokens that aren't redeemed before Binance stops support will automatically be converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "What Is Ethereum and How Does It Work? - Binance Academy",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum is the second most popular blockchain network with a native cryptocurrency ETH, which is the second largest crypto in terms of market capitalization after Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum network transitioned from Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 to improve the network's capabilities.\n\nVitalik Buterin's vision for Ethereum focuses on utility, providing developers with the infrastructure to build diverse decentralized applications\n\nEthereum's ecosystem spans DeFi, gaming, NFTs, DAOs, and more, bolstering its position as a foundational pillar in the digital economy\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum, conceptualized in 2014 by programmer Vitalik Buterin, stands as a monumental pillar in the world of blockchain technology. At its essence, Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source platform powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). Unlike traditional systems that operate on centralized servers, Ethereum runs on a vast, interconnected network of computers, known as nodes. This globally dispersed setup ensures that the platform remains resilient against single points of failure and censorship.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin, the inaugural blockchain protocol, both function as platforms facilitating digital money transfers, Ethereum's distinction lies in its broader utility. Ethereum serves as a platform for deploying \"smart contracts,\" which are autonomous computer programs that automatically execute actions when certain conditions are met, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing transactional transparency.\n\nThis feature has made Ethereum an indispensable tool for developers, offering them a canvas to create decentralized applications (DApps). These DApps can range from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to games, each tapping into Ethereum's robust infrastructure. As blockchain technology continues its ascent in the modern digital age, Ethereum's role as a facilitator for DApps underscores its relevance and potential for transformative impacts across various industries.\n\nHow Is Ethereum Different From Bitcoin?\n\nDespite sharing the foundational principle (blockchain technology) with Bitcoin, Ethereum serves distinct purposes and is built on divergent philosophies. The key differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin are:\n\n1. Origin and purpose\n\nBitcoin, introduced in 2009 by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, was conceived primarily as a digital alternative to traditional currencies. Bitcoin is envisioned as a decentralized form of money immune to governmental interference or inflation. Its primary function is to serve as a medium of exchange, store of value, and, for some, a unit of account.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, was created in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin with a broader vision. While it does have its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), Ethereum's true purpose extends beyond just facilitating transactions. It's designed as a platform for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). These allow for programmable transactions and a multitude of applications beyond mere currency transfers.\n\n2. Smart contracts and DApps\n\nEthereum's aforementioned capability to facilitate smart contracts and DApps is its defining distinction. While Bitcoin does offer a form of smart contract functionality, Ethereum's is more flexible and generalized, allowing for an array of applications, from games to DeFi platforms, to be built atop its platform.\n\n3. Tokenomics\n\nBitcoin has a capped supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins ever to be mined into existence. This scarcity principle is one of its core value propositions. Ethereum, in contrast, doesn't have a hard-capped supply. However, following its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2022, Ethereum has shown more deflationary characteristics in its supply dynamics.\n\nIn summary, while both Bitcoin and Ethereum leverage blockchain technology, they cater to different domains of the digital economy. Bitcoin aims to disrupt the way we perceive and use money, while Ethereum seeks to revolutionize how applications and agreements function in a decentralized setting.\n\nHow Does Ethereum Work?\n\nEthereum\u2019s functionalities extend beyond mere cryptocurrency transfer, and therefore has some unique designs in its working mechanisms.\n\n1. Smart Contracts\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Once deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, they autonomously execute predefined functions when certain conditions are met. For instance, a smart contract might automatically transfer funds from one party to another on a specified date.\n\n2. Decentralized Applications (DApps)\n\nBuilt atop Ethereum's platform, DApps are applications that run on a blockchain. They leverage Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, ensuring that all data and transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable. This has led to the rise of various decentralized platforms, ranging from DeFi, GameFi, to decentralized identities.\n\n3. Ether and gas\n\nAt Ethereum's core is its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). While Ether can be used for peer-to-peer transactions like Bitcoin, it's primarily used within Ethereum to facilitate and incentivize operations. Every action on Ethereum, from simple transfers to complex smart contract interactions, requires computational effort. This effort is quantified as \"gas\", and users pay for this gas using Ether.\n\n4. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n\nThe EVM serves as the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. More than being confined to just the Ethereum network, it's mirrored across every node within the Ethereum ecosystem, reinforcing decentralization and consensus-driven operations. This comprehensive replication fosters a high level of security and uniformity across the network.\n\nFurthermore, the EVM's design plays a pivotal role in promoting interoperability. Various blockchain platforms have recognized the potential of the EVM and have integrated EVM-compatible layers or mechanisms into their systems. By doing so, smart contracts designed for Ethereum can be deployed and run on these EVM-compatible blockchains without significant modifications. This adaptability not only reduces development efforts but also bridges different blockchain communities, fostering collaboration and expanding the decentralized application landscape.\n\n5. Consensus Mechanisms\n\nEthereum originally operated on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, much like Bitcoin. However, the network successfully transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades in 2022. PoS offers increased scalability and energy efficiency. In PoS, validators replace miners in the creation and verification of blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they \"stake\" or lock up as collateral.\n\nIn essence, Ethereum works as a multi-faceted platform, not just enabling digital currency transactions but also fostering a space where decentralized, trustless applications and agreements can thrive. Its flexibility and adaptability make it a foundational pillar of the modern crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe Merge: Ethereum\u2019s Transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake\n\nEthereum previously relied on a process known as mining, utilizing the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, akin to Bitcoin's method. Yet, with the landmark event of \"The Merge\" on September 15, 2022, Ethereum pivoted to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model for its network state updates. This transition to PoS marked the end of Ethereum's reliance on PoW, culminating in a dramatic decrease in energy consumption by nearly 99.95%.\n\nProof-of-Stake is a consensus algorithm introduced in 2011 as an alternative to Proof-of-Work. It aims to overcome the scalability limitations of PoW networks. PoS is the second-most-popular consensus algorithm, adopted by chains including BNB Chain, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).\n\nWhat Is Ethereum 2.0?\n\n\u200b\u200bEthereum 2.0 (aka Eth2 or \"Serenity\u201d) is a series of the long-awaited upgrades to the Ethereum network that promises, among other things, to improve the network\u2019s scalability. Through the implementation of several enhancements, speed, efficiency, and scalability should be improved without sacrificing security and decentralization. This version of Ethereum has always been on the horizon, but it\u2019s taken some years to roll out. The primary reason for this is that scaling a blockchain in a secure and decentralized way is a challenging task.\n\nThe roll-out of Ethereum 2.0 is a gradual process that was initially planned in three main phases to ensure its success: phase 0, phase 1/1.5 and phase 2. Each phase incorporated distinct features essential to Ethereum's new and effective implementation.\n\nPhase 0 saw the successful introduction of the Beacon Chain, launched on December 1st, 2020. It runs parallel to the mainnet and focuses on accepting validators (or stakers) through a one-way deposit contract. Validators' ETH is locked until the next phase, making it essential to understand that un-staking is only possible once shard chains are fully implemented.\n\nPhase 1/1.5 was intended to be the combination of two phases, the introduction of shard chains and Ethereum's mainnet transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). Phase 1 introduces shard chains which enables validators to create blocks on the blockchain through PoS. Phase 1.5 began rolling out in 2021 and marks the official transition away from PoW.\n\nPhase 2, the final phase, will enable Ethereum 2.0 to support fully formed shards and become the official Ethereum network. Shard chains will also work with smart contracts, allowing seamless integration of dApps and various technologies with Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe Ethereum Ecosystem: DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Beyond\n\nSince the inception of Ethereum, countless applications and products have been developed on the platform making it the second most popular cryptocurrency. Here are some of the most exciting and interesting features to come from this ecosystem.\n\n1. Decentralized finance (DeFi)\n\nDeFi represents financial applications developed atop blockchain infrastructures. The unique feature of DeFi is that it functions without central authorities, providing an open and programmable financial system.\n\nBy leveraging smart contracts and distributed systems, users can securely create decentralized finance applications. DeFi businesses currently offer services ranging from P2P lending and borrowing, to accruing interest on crypto assets, and decentralized exchanges to trade on. Some notable DeFi platforms include Compound Finance, Aave, and UniSwap.\n\n2. Gaming\n\nGaming and virtual reality has become a large part of the Ethereum network. Decentraland and Sandbox are two of the biggest platforms that have created virtual worlds. The Ethereum blockchain is used to secure tokenized ownership of land, avatars, wearables and other goods. Non-fungible tokens\n\n3. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are tokenized versions of digital or real-world assets that function as verifiable proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. They can be used by decentralized applications (DApps) to allow for the creation and ownership of unique digital items and collectibles.\n\nVarious frameworks have been created to facilitate the issuance of NFTs. The most prominent of these is ERC-721, which is a standard for the issuance and trading of non-fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain.This standardization of NFTs allows a higher degree of interoperability, meaning that unique assets can be transferred between applications with relative ease.\n\nIt is evident that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have the potential to be one of the key components of a new blockchain-powered digital economy. They could be used in many different fields, such as video games, digital identity, licensing, certificates, or fine art - and even allow fractional ownership of items. Storing ownership and identification data on the blockchain would increase data integrity and privacy, while easy, trustless transfers and management of these assets could reduce friction in trade and the global economy.\n\n4. DAO development\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are community-led entities, governed by computer code and without central authority. These organizations use smart contracts or applications to gather information or votes to buy into the majority of the group transparently and without the use of a third party.\n\nEven though the role of the Ethereum cryptocurrency may be vague for DAOs, it is clear that there is some sort of influence or interest from a personal and corporate finance perspective.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions.\n\n1. Is Ethereum a cryptocurrency?\n\nEthereum is the blockchain technology platform which uses ether (ETH) as its native cryptocurrency. The platform itself supports a large range of DdApps, including other cryptocurrencies powered by the ethereum blockchain. It is important to note that many people will refer to the cryptocurrency as Ethereum.\n\n2. How can I buy Ethereum?\n\nIn order to buy ether you can use one of many cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Ethereum is supported by all major centralized and decentralized exchanges. You can simply create your account at an exchange that you trust, deposit fiat or cryptocurrencies to buy or swap ETH.\n\n3. Is Ethereum a good investment?\n\nAs with any investment, it really depends on your risk tolerance, financial stability, objectives, and so forth. ETH is certainly a volatile investment, you should conduct your own research to determine if ETH is a good investment for you.\n\n4. How does Ethereum make money?\n\nAs a decentralized platform, Ethereum does not make money like a traditional organization. Those who participate in securing and maintaining the network as stakers and validators get rewarded. They earn ether as a reward for validating transactions and creating new blocks.\n\n5. Can you convert Ethereum into cash?\n\nThe simple answer is yes! You can use online cryptocurrency exchanges for this process. You can create your exchange account and link your bank account to it. Once this has been done, you can send ETH to an exchange account from an Ethereum compatible wallet. Once the ETH has arrived into your exchange account, you can place an order to sell it. Once this order has been processed, you can transfer the fiat currency to the linked bank account.\n\n6. What happens if I lose my ETH?\n\nSince there aren\u2019t any banks involved, you\u2019re responsible for your own funds. You can store your coins on an exchange, or in your own wallet. It\u2019s important to note that if you use your own wallet, you absolutely must take care of your seed phrase. Keep it safe because you need it to restore your funds in case you lose access to your wallet.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhat Is Ethereum 2.0 And Why Does It Matter?\n\nWhat is Etherscan and How to Use It?\n\nBNB Smart Chain vs. Ethereum: What\u2019s the Difference\n\nDisclaimer and Risk Warning: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

This indicates significantly more long orders than short orders in the market, causing bulls to pay a premium to rebalance.\n\nHigh funding rates are often followed by a \u201cflush,\u201d where futures positions are forcibly closed, causing prices to cascade in the opposite direction.\n\nYou might also like: Will Bitcoin ETFs follow gold ETFs\u2019 path to success?\n\nThis was highlighted by the analyst Mister Crypto, who suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s high funding rates were \u201csignaling a top.\u201d\n\nIn the analysis, Mister Crypto noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price retraced by 20% each time its funding rates reached their recent levels.\n\nGiven Bitcoin has pulled back less than 5% so far, this could indicate a much deeper correction is imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, prominent X commentator MrChief predicts that the market will \u201cpullback enough to stop out early buyers & get bears super excited then reverse back up.\u201d\n\nHowever, other analysts believe the crypto market may be poised for a longer-term pullback. One is RektCapital, who referenced earlier market cycles\u2019 price action to suggest that \u201cthe Bitcoin Pre-Halving top may be very close.\u201d\n\nThat said, the Bitcoin halving is just 137 days away and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the cusp of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, the market looks poised for a solid mid-term trajectory.\n\nEven so, market participants seeking growth appear to be considering Bitcoin ETF Token whose presale is in progress.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token presale raises $3.4 million in 1 month\n\nBitcoin ETF Token has raised almost $3.5 million in one month. The project features multiple use cases, rewarding holders as the SEC approves spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe project features a deflationary mechanism. 25% of its supply is reserved to be burned across five Bitcoin ETF milestones.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 5% burn tax on transactions, reducing by 1% at each target.\n\nThese scarcity-focused features, combined with the anticipated $1 trillion in liquidity entering the crypto market from the Bitcoin ETFs, could support Bitcoin ETF Token.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin breaks above $40k, Bitcoin ETF Token raises nearly $2.5m\n\nFurther supporting this is the project\u2019s current early stage and low market cap at launch of just $12.39 million.\n\nBitcoin ETF Token also has a staking mechanism, offering a 79% APY. Even so, this will decrease as more tokens are staked, incentivizing buyers to get in early to maximize their gains.\n\nThe project also offers a Bitcoin ETF Alerts service. This is a news feed that pulls latest Bitcoin updates from around the web into one place. The feature aims to foster a more active and engaged community.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Presale"

Transition Options for Users: Russian users can switch to CommEX for continued ruble trading or use Binance\u2019s options for withdrawing or converting rubles before the deadline. New Listings and Margin Trading: Binance added new tokens like PIVX and trading pairs to its Margin Trading program, allowing leveraged trades with higher profit and risk potential.\n\nBinance to Exit Russia\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market capitalization \u2013 Binance \u2013 announced it will no longer support certain P2P trading pairs tied to Russia\u2019s national currency \u2013 the ruble.\n\nThose pairs include BTC/RUB, ETH/RUB, USDT/RUB, BNB/RUB, FDUSD/RUB, BUSD/RUB, and RUB/RUB, as the amendments are scheduled to take effect from January 31, 2024.\n\nBinance\u2019s move follows the previous decision to exit the Russian market by selling the entirety of its local business to the crypto platform CommEX.\n\n\u201cTherefore, users can continue P2P trading with Russian ruble (RUB) free of charge on the CommEX platform,\u201d the exchange explained.\n\nThose willing to jump on board need to register with a CommEX account and connect it to the corresponding Binance one. Alternatively, clients have the option to withdraw their Russian rubles via Binance\u2019s fiat partners before January 31, 2024, convert RUB into digital assets, or trade RUB for crypto on the Binance Spot market.\n\nBinance\u2019s Latest Listing\n\nBesides removing certain trading pairs, the leading marketplace has expanded some its offerings with more tokens.\n\nLast week, it added PIVX (PIVX) as a new borrowable digital asset on Cross Margin and Isolated Margin. It also included ADA/FDUSD and DOGE/FDUSD, among other trading pairs, in its Isolated Margin program.\n\nBinance Margin Trading allows eligible clients access to funds from the exchange for use in leveraged trades. Thus, traders can deal with greater sums and adjust their positions appropriately.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that margin trading could bring greater profits in the case of successful trades. Nonetheless, it could lead to more significant losses if the market moves in the opposite direction."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%\n\nProjections highlighted interesting observations for Ethereum\u2019s supply\n\nMore than 307,000 Ethereum [ETH] coins have exited circulation since the pivotal \u2018Merge\u2019 event. In fact, this was the lowest volume of ETH in circulation since the network made a historic shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nETH\u2019s supply goes south\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s scrutiny of ultra sound money data, the net supply has been shrinking at an annual rate of 0.248%. This might appear inconsequential to some but fathom this \u2013 Had the transition not taken place, ETH\u2019s total supply would have increased by more than 4.71 million with an annual inflation rate of 3.168%.\n\nScarcity is critical to the long-term demand of any financial asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the fewer tokens in circulation, the greater the likelihood of price increases, provided demand for the asset remains the same.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s current supply stood at 120.21 million. As per long-term projections, the supply has hit its peak, with the same to gradually start declining from next year. By the end of 2025, the total number of ETH in circulation is predicted to shrink to 117.7 million.\n\nA much-needed respite\n\nThis is a welcome development as not too long ago, ETH became inflationary owing to poor participation on the network. For much of September and early October, more coins were getting created than they were burned.\n\nAs examined by AMBCrypto using Glassnode\u2019s data, network fees tumbled to yearly lows during the aforementioned period. This suggested that transactions on the network had declined, leading to fewer ETH getting burned.\n\nNote that a part of the fee charged for validating transactions, called base fee, is burned and removed from circulation. Generally, a bull market with high network usage aids deflation and vice versa.\n\nRead ETH\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nMarket still upbeat, despite pullback\n\nAt press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $2.240, having just recorded one of the sharpest corrections since the commencement of the bull rally in October.\n\nHaving said that, the market sentiment remains optimistic. Greed remains uniform across the market, with AMBCrypto using Hyblock Capital\u2019s data to highlight the same. This is a key finding since it is generally assumed that greed drives the asset\u2019s value higher."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could lose critical support at $40,000 as RSI confirms BTC is ripe for selling.\n\nEthereum price clings firm to the uptrend and records a healthy pullback as $2,147 support continues to hold.\n\nRipple price risks an extended 7% fall to the $0.5773 support level as XRP bulls show weakness.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price remains bullish despite the catastrophic setback recorded during the early trading hours of the Asian session. While several other narratives support the big-picture bullish outlook, spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a role to play in it.\n\nAs traders and investors continue to anticipate the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) giving approvals for the product launches between January 5 and 10, even Google has taken a hint. An official announcement reveals that \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States [will be allowed] to advertise those products and services\" beginning January 29, 2024. Notably, this is the same month that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to gain approval in the US.\n\nBitcoin price delivers a healthy retest\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price folding back to record an intra-day low of $40,400 was a healthy retest as the $40,000 psychological level continues to hold as support. If the level holds, then it could precipitate the idea that new all-time highs are in the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, the upside potential remains strong for Bitcoin price as BTC is still not ripe for selling until the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses below the 70 level. With the Awesome Oscillator (AO) showing large volumes of green histogram bars, the bulls still maintain a strong presence in the market though. The RSI could simply hold above 70.\n\nIncreased buying pressure above current levels could see Bitcoin price overcome the weekly supply zone extending from $40,698 to $46,999. A weekly candlestick close above the $43,860 mean threshold would confirm the continuation of the primary trend.\n\nSuch a move would set the tone for Bitcoin price to flip the supply zone into a bullish breaker, confirmed by a move above the $48,725 resistance level.In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin price could extend to tag the $66,098 resistance level into a support floor.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if the weekly supply zone defends as a resistance order block, Bitcoin price could pull south, losing the support at $40,000. A decisive weekly candlestick close below this level would put BTC on the cliff, potentially rolling over to the $30,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin braces for volatility-filled week with November CPI data release, Fed decision\n\nEthereum price sell-off threatens upside potential\n\nEthereum (ETH) price also crashed alongside Bitcoin, losing almost 9% in market value. However, the move remains a healthy pullback as the $2,147 support level did not break. As long as ETH remains above the $2,000 psychological level, the upside potential remains alive.\n\nIncreased buying pressure could see Ethereum price clear the $2,403 range high even as it continues to consolidate within the confines of an ascending parallel channel.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flipside, increased seller momentum could plunge Ethereum price out of the bullish chart pattern, confirmed by a break and close below critical $2,147 support. ETH might then confirm the continuation of the fall by breaking and closing below the midline of the supply zone turned bullish breaker at $2,075. The move could clear the path for the largest altcoin by market capitalization to spiral to the $2,000 psychological level.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum leads altcoins north as Bitcoin halts amid bull trap fears"

Bonk Inu\u2019s Exceptional Performance: The Solana-based memecoin, Bonk Inu, saw a 400% rise in its price, outstripping other popular memecoins.\n\nSOL Performing Better Than ETH in This Aspect\n\nThe sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u2013 Solana (SOL) \u2013 has been on a tear lately, with its price soaring from the start of Q4, 2023. Last weekend, it hit almost $75 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), a peak last witnessed in May 2022. In the following days, SOL slightly decreased to its current level of $71 due to the ongoing market correction.\n\nApart from experiencing a rapid price ascent, the asset also surpassed several of its rivals in terms of transaction volume and other metrics.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, Solana non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume has marked a bigger increase on a weekly basis than Ethereum. The figure with the former has reached almost $68 million, 53% higher than the observed data a week before.\n\nWhile Ethereum NFT sales volume for the past seven days stands at nearly $100 million, it actually represents a 5% drop for a week. Moreover, Solana briefly outpaced its rival on December 8 when it witnessed $16 million of such sales versus $11 million for the other blockchain protocol.\n\nSolana\u2019s BONK Stole the Show\n\nSolana might have captured some investors\u2019 attention, but its memecoin Bonk Inu (BONK) has undoubtedly taken center stage recently.\n\nThe token\u2019s price has exploded by 400% on a monthly basis, hitting an all-time high on December 9. In addition, its market capitalization currently hovers around $800 million, positioning the asset as the 81st largest in the entire crypto realm.\n\nBONK\u2019s impressive rise could be attributed to Solana\u2019s uptrend and the hype surrounding memecoins. However, some of the leading tokens of that type, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have failed to catch up with Bonk Inu\u2019s speed, registering more modest spikes as of late."

For the time being, another crypto that\u2019s gained significant attention is Pullix (PLX), which can completely change the TradFi space with an innovative approach.\n\nSolana (SOL) Experiences Price Correction Despite 333.5% Growth\n\nSolana (SOL) recently saw a major price correction as it moved down in value to $59. The cryptocurrency began the year strong, where Solana grew from $8 to a peak value of $61.29 before correcting. The recent retrace from the October high is not too significant.\n\nWith its impressive market cap of $25,296,290,926 and a trading volume of $1,675,035,225, the Solana network has showcased no signs of slowing down, and the total price increase this year is still at 333.5%.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) saw a price pump as bulls regained control of the market and initiated a rally in the short run. The breakout above the $2,000 hurdle also provided the crypto with a lot of investor attention, and the price continued the momentum, which was supported by a decent buying volume.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) also saw a significant upswing as it made its way towards Stage 8 of its presale, fueled by interest in its disruptive blockchain technology implementation and AI-driven features. We will explore the opportunity for both cryptos and see how far they can climb.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Breaks Above $2,000 \u2013 To Reach $3,332.19 in Q1, 2024\n\nIn the past year, Ethereum (ETH) saw a total price upswing of 75%. During the previous seven days, ETH moved up in value from $2,201 to $2,384, and this growth occurred following the crypto\u2019s break above the $2,000 price barrier. Currently, the Ethereum market cap is at $266,955,902,567, while its trading volume is at $20,666,358,004.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on November 15 that following the SEC delaying the ETH futures ETF bid, he believes if they do approve the application, it will allow Grayscale to argue for the approval of the spot Ether ETF application. As a result, this pushed interest in the Ethereum crypto further and could lead it to new heights. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $3,332.19 by the start of 2024.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Will Enable Fractional Ownership in Multi-Million Dollar Properties\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) will disrupt the $280 trillion real estate market through the introduction of blockchain elements that will tackle key issues in the industry. Historically, most people had trouble accessing the space due to the high costs of entry, as most properties would cost millions of dollars that needed to be paid upfront.\n\nAs a result, Everlodge will mint each property as an NFT and, afterward, will fractionalize them. This way, if a property is worth $5,000,000, it can get split into 50,000 pieces worth just $100 each. Holders of these fractions retain all of the benefits associated with property ownership, such as passive income from rental properties and value appreciation.\n\nThere will also be an AI tool that can predict future markets in which properties can explode in value, providing users with high ROI opportunities. A Rewards Club will be available where holders of the native crypto can get access to free nightly stays, and a Launchpad will be featured, where property builders can get funding from the community. As a result, anyone will be able to build a vast, diversified portfolio of properties and maximize their opportunities. All of these aspects make it the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile analysts are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s future, it will take some time for the crypto to reach the projected gains. Currently, the ELDG crypto is undergoing its crypto ICO phase and is at Stage 8, trading at just $0.027. With its recent momentum in mind, at launch, analysts are expecting a price upswing of 2,500%.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website."

        "content": "During a recent interview, Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz underscored Solana\u2019s unique blockchain capabilities, which enable functionalities not feasible on other platforms.\n\nSolana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko highlighted the evolution of DeFi on Solana, moving from copying Ethereum protocols to developing unique applications like Jupiter and Jito.\n\nThis is leveraging Solana\u2019s specific infrastructure and demonstrating a shift from imitation to innovation.\n\nLarry Cermak, CEO of The Block interviewed Solana Labs Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko and Mert Mumtaz, Co-Founder and CEO of Helius Labs and discussed the bullish case for Solana. Below are some of the highlights.\n\nOnly Possible on Solana\n\nMert Mumtaz talked about the unique capabilities of Solana\u2019s blockchain technology. He started by mentioning a demo with the Get Code team, showcasing Solana\u2019s proficiency in handling microtransactions due to its low fees and predictability. This efficiency and speed impressed him, leading him to believe that such performance is only possible on Solana.\n\nSo, and the thought process behind it is like, we don\u2019t [\u2026] Solana enables a much broader design space that you don\u2019t want to just copy apps from the EVM and make them look slightly better. You want to just build things that can\u2019t be like vampire attacks and go to other chains, right. Mert Mumtaz Mert Mumtaz\n\nHe also highlighted Solana\u2019s distinct approach to storage and computation, where storage is more expensive but balanced by efficient computational processes. This balance allows for the creation of large numbers of digital assets at a lower cost. He cited the migration of projects like Render Network and Helium to Solana, driven by the inability of their original platforms to support their use cases.\n\nAnother significant aspect Mumtaz touched on is the concept of compression in Solana, which has shifted the mindset from scarcity to abundance in the world of NFTs. This shift allows for a more expansive and accessible approach to NFTs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeFi to Flourish on Solana \u2013 Though in Different Ways than on Ethereum\n\nMeanwhile Anatoly Yakovenko reflected on the distinct evolution of DeFi (Decentralised Finance) on Solana compared to Ethereum. He observed that initially, many DeFi protocols on Solana were mere copies of those on Ethereum. However, the trend has shifted, and now successful DeFi applications on Solana are uniquely built for its ecosystem.\n\nDuring the last cycle it was basically copy and paste protocols from Ethereum. But now stuff that\u2019s successful is uniquely built on Solana. The whole magic premise of Solana is that everyone\u2019s connected in one world computer, that\u2019s the one chunk of RAM, that\u2019s globally replicated. Anatoly Yakovenko Anatoly Yakovenko\n\nYakovenko mentioned Jupiter as an example, comparing it to Ethereum\u2019s 1Inch. Jupiter stands out because it leverages Solana\u2019s asynchronous communication and the high cost of gas fees on Ethereum, which 1Inch cannot circumvent. Jupiter\u2019s uniqueness lies in its ability to atomically route transactions across numerous markets and aggregate liquidity efficiently, which is a direct utilisation of Solana\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nAnd also I think what\u2019s really interesting is Jito, it\u2019s kind of like a combination of flashbots and Lido which is also different. It\u2019s not a copy paste from Ethereum in any way. It\u2019s from the ground up created based on the nuance of fast rotating block producers and the way the staking system works on Solana. Anatoly Yakovenko Anatoly Yakovenko\n\nYakovenko emphasised that these developments on Solana are not mere replications of Ethereum\u2019s features. While there might be some overlap in functionalities, applications like Jupiter offer a completely different design approach, tailored to Solana\u2019s infrastructure and optimising its specific chain characteristics. This demonstrates a shift from imitation to innovation in Solana\u2019s DeFi landscape."

        "content": "The Ethereum price has been among the worst hit in the flash crash that took place on Monday. The crash sent the asset\u2019s price down below $2,200 for the first time in the last week and has continued to trend low around this point. As the market shows a bit of recovery momentum, questions remain about what could have triggered the crash.\n\nEthereum Price Fell Because Whales Have Been Selling\n\nOne of the most obvious causes of the flash crash that affected the Ethereum price is the fact that large holders have been selling. This month, ETH hit its highest level in the last year and this sent a lot of investors back into profit. Now, since there has not been a complete bullish turnover of the crypto market, there are expectations that the market could crash and investors are trying to secure profits before this happens.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Market Experts Predict When Cardano (ADA) Price Will Cross $7 9 months ago\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez flagged the selling from these large holders in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday. According to him, these large holders had actually begun selling when the price had first crossed $2,300. This means that the selling pressure had been mounting for a while before being reflected in the price.\n\nThe whales who hold more than 10,000 ETH in their balances had been reducing their holdings toward the end of November. By December, their holdings had fallen to their lowest point in the last three months, showing proof of massive sell-offs by these whales.\n\nETH price at $2,242 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nUncertainty About Macro Factors\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainty has also played a role in the crypto crash that sent the Ethereum price to $2,200. One example of this is the CPI data release that is expected to take place on Tuesday. As investors eagerly await the results from the announcement, market fluctuations are expected.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nWhy Is XRP Price Up Today? Ripple\u2019s Massive Buyback May Have The Answer 9 months ago\n\nThe November inflation data is also expected to be released this week, as well as the Fed\u2019s decision and statement happening on Monday. Ahead of these events, high volatility is always expected as investors move to secure some of their positions.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum has begun to show some bullish momentum once more. It has since bounced from its lows of $2,170 and is back up above $2,000, where bulls are already providing a lot of support. If Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to rise, Ethereum could reclaim the $2,300 level before the day is over.\n\nThe price of ETH is sitting at $2,238 at the time of this writing, down 4.50% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from Quora, chart from Tradingview.com"

From here, you will find a button allowing you to claim assets to a single address or a number of addresses.\n\nSingapore \u2013 December 11, 2023\n\nIn a landmark development, Enjin has executed the largest NFT migration away from Ethereum to date, transferring an astonishing 200 million NFTs to the Enjin Blockchain.\n\nThis shift includes assets from thousands of creators, notably including tech giant Microsoft, highlighting the tech industry\u2019s growing demand for blockchain efficiency and scalability.\n\nEffective immediately, NFT holders can seamlessly claim their assets on the Enjin Blockchain using the Enjin Wallet with a simple \u201cClaim\u201d click.\n\nPost-migration benefits include Enjin\u2019s network-wide fuel tanks, providing free transactions across the ecosystem for the next three months.

Looking ahead, Enjin aims to empower games and applications to launch their own Layer 1 chains, which would be fully interoperable within the broader Enjin Blockchain ecosystem.\n\nEnjin\u2019s infrastructure is specifically designed to enable games to scale effectively, catering to mass market demands and bypassing the limitations of legacy blockchain infrastructure.\n\nA specialized NFT-centric fork of the Polkadot Network, Enjin Blockchain addresses scalability issues by offering low transaction fees of just $0.005. This, combined with a throughput of 5,000 transactions per second and the capability to mint up to 2,000 NFTs in a single transaction, sets a new standard in NFT usability.\n\n\u201cEnjin\u2019s NFT migration follows and completes its token migration,\u201d added Oscar Franklin Tan, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer of Atlas, Enjin Contributor. \u201cThis was one of the most complex, unprecedented blockchain migrations in history, involving both fungible and non-fungible tokens from Ethereum, Polkadot and Enjin Blockchain. Strong support from migrating holders secures the new Enjin Blockchain and expands governance.\u201d\n\nAbout Enjin\n\nSince 2017, Enjin has been the world\u2019s first end-to-end Web3 game development platform and ecosystem, centered around Enjin Blockchain and supported by a seamless app layer consisting of a wallet, marketplace, API, and advanced developer tools.\n\nAs a scalable, affordable, and feature-rich ecosystem, Enjin\u2019s technology has seen wide application in blockchain games, apps, enterprise initiatives, and innovative marketing campaigns. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), the native token of the Enjin Blockchain. To date, over 200 million NFTs have already been created using Enjin\u2019s tools.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nRene Stefancic\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nOscar Franklin Tan\n\nChief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer\n\nAtlas Development Services, a core contributor to Enjin Blockchain\n\npress@enjin.io\n\nsimonket@enjin.io\n\nwww.enjin.io"
