        "title": "Taiko's David Weisiger on revolutionizing Ethereum scalability [Q&A] - TechNode Global",
        "content": "In this TNGlobal Q&A, Taiko\u2019s Head of Developer Relations, David Weisiger, offers deep insights into innovative approaches to scaling Ethereum via Layer 2 solutions. Weisiger, a seasoned software engineer with a rich history at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace, brings a unique perspective to Taiko\u2019s mission. He elaborates on his decision to join the company, particularly driven its vision of minimal yet highly ambitious scaling of Ethereum. His commitment to contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in Taiko\u2019s efforts to maintain a \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d approach with their scaling solutions, highlighting their dedication to open-source development and collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s PSE team.\n\nThe conversation delves into the technical aspects of Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain technologies, clarifying their roles in the Ethereum network. Weisiger explains how Layer 2, particularly in the wake of network congestion and high transaction costs experienced in 2020 and 2021, has emerged as a crucial element in Ethereum\u2019s scalability roadmap, known as \u201cThe Surge.\u201d He discusses the company\u2019s approach to Layer 2 security, embracing multi-proofs and a minimal-change protocol to enhance auditability and reliability. Additionally, Weisiger touches on the broader implications of blockchain technology in the context of the global economy and geopolitical tensions, predicting significant developments in blockchain adoption and Ethereum scaling by 2024.\n\nTell us about your decision to join the Taiko team, and please describe how the company contributes to the ETH ecosystem.\n\nI already knew one of the co-founders from my time at GameStop working on the NFT marketplace as an engineer. Frankly, I joined because of the co-founders I interviewed, and I was sold on the highly ambitious and minimal scaling vision they had for Ethereum. To change as little as possible, and to simply scale Ethereum itself, no other changes\u2013just \u201cpure Ethereum\u201d. Additionally, I wanted to work on technology that would benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, from our contributions to the EF\u2019s PSE team to our completely open-source codebase.\n\nWhat is a Layer 1 and 2? And why is Layer 2 becoming more popular in recent years?\n\nEthereum is a Layer 1, it is the original blockchain we come to know as Ethereum which persists data and executes smart contracts. Layer 2 is a way of achieving scalability for Ethereum by representing more computation which happens off-chain into a compressed format, tapping into Ethereum as a permissionless data availability layer. This is because the cost of data storage on Ethereum is really expensive.\n\nL2s may scale the Ethereum L1 capacity by around 1,000 times and lower the transaction cost by a few 100 times. With the network congestion on the Ethereum network in 2020/2021 and high transaction costs during that period of time, it becomes very clear that L2 is the most important Ethereum scaling solution (Layer 2\u2019s has been a central part of the Ethereum roadmap as part of \u201cThe Surge\u201d). The concept of Layer 2 is always changing. We are challenging the traditional notion of what Layer 2 / Layer 3 is in our research and development of booster rollups.\n\nETH security is becoming an increasingly important topic so what has Taiko done to contribute and improve Layer 2?\n\nThere are several dimensions to security for Layer 2. One dimension is the proof system\u2013in this case, we have agreed with Vitalik\u2019s idea of utilizing multi-proofs. This means that we assume there is a bug in one implementation of a proof system so it\u2019s best to rely on multiple systems instead of just one. Additionally, we strive to make a minimal amount of changes in our protocol and client, both to be fully Ethereum-equivalent and also to make it more auditable.\n\nAnother dimension (in the spirit of minimalism) is reducing trust assumptions wherever we can. The first area that comes to mind is the fully permissionless proposing (this is referred to as a \u201cbased rollup\u201d) and fully permissionless proving.\n\nTaiko has contributed to the open-source development of the halo2 circuits along with others (mainly the EF\u2019s PSE team) and also contributes by open-sourcing our entire stack. Developers can use our client, protocol, etc. easily as it\u2019s all available and well-documented on GitHub.\n\nHow do you differentiate Taiko from other L2s?\n\nThe primary difference between Taiko and other L2s is that it is a based rollup, and fully permissionless to participate in. Anyone can propose a block or prove a block on our test net. Additionally, Taiko is Ethereum-equivalent, which means that we do not make any changes whatsoever to the developer environment\u2013put more technically, Taiko fully implements the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications (on the execution layer). Another difference is our innovative idea of utilizing booster rollups to natively scale Ethereum. Check out our CTO Brecht\u2019s EthResearch post on it!\n\nWhat are some examples of how your company helps its community and partners with its scaling solutions?\n\nWe develop our code totally in the open and also do many discussions and educational sessions publicly as well. We also love chatting with teams in the space that are very related to our protocol such as MEV, re-staking, block building, ZK proving, DAOs, etc. We enjoy participating in discussions about this and offering our insights!\n\nThe best example is definitely our research and development though. We believe we have great scaling ideas for Ethereum that others can use in their rollups or however they see fit.\n\nWhere do you see the broader crypto market going into 2024?\n\n2024 will be a very interesting year. There is a lot of risk in the global economy, and the geopolitical tension adds more uncertainty to it. There are always two sides to a coin, on one side the risk would affect the amount of capital coming into the crypto market, on the flip side blockchain and crypto are created trying to solve this exact problem and there\u2019ll be more use cases and demand for an alternative infrastructure to address the deglobalization. But one thing is sure, for the blockchain world to fulfill its mission and purpose, scaling is a must. And 2024 will be the year when Ethereum scaling becomes a reality and comes to fruition. I believe that no matter how the broader market is going to be, we\u2019ll see major adoption of blockchain technology."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRecently announced Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast, led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has pulled in over half a billion dollars worth of locked funds from users seeking yield and rewards\u2014but also faced substantial criticism over its rollout. And now early investor Paradigm has joined the list of parties with issues over the launch.\n\nOn Sunday, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson shared a post on X (aka Twitter) that took Blast\u2019s launch to task, attributing his comments to \u201cwe at Paradigm,\u201d suggesting it conveyed the prominent crypto-centric venture capital firm\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cThat said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I\u2019m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don\u2019t agree with the decision to launch the\u2026 \u2014 Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast is billed as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers \u201cnative yield for Ethereum and stablecoins,\u201d letting users stake (or lock up) their funds in the network to earn an interest-like return.\n\nThe network also promises Blur-like \u201crewards\u201d ahead for users, enticing early adopters to lock up their funds ahead of a potential airdrop ahead. Blur has already awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, catapulting the marketplace ahead of former leader OpenSea in the process, and that historical example may be enticing for crypto users.\n\nHowever, while users have been excitedly locking up their funds ahead of Blast\u2019s network launch in 2024\u2014bringing Blast\u2019s total value locked (TVL) to about $535 million at present, per data from DeFi Llama\u2014the team has also faced significant criticism in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEssentially, early users are locking their funds into a bridge that will eventually connect from Ethereum to Blast\u2014but the Blast network isn\u2019t actually live yet. And those funds cannot be withdrawn until the expected mainnet rollout in February, drawing security concerns due to the industry\u2019s history of network bridges being exploited for vast sums of crypto. Some traders and industry builders have also called Blast a Ponzi scheme, given its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun \u201cPacman\u201d Roquerre has rebuked such complaints, writing in a Twitter thread on Friday that there were \u201ca number of misunderstandings\u201d around Blast and attempting to address them.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking\u2026 \u2014 Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nHe also said Friday that Paradigm\u2014which was one of the investors in Blast\u2019s $20 million seed round\u2014had no role in Blast\u2019s rollout plans. In fact, Pacman revealed then that Paradigm asked the Blast team to \u201cmake changes\u201d to the launch and that Blast was considering them, but that it would ultimately make any decisions in-house.\n\nRobinson on Sunday praised Pacman and his team for the launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users in the process. However, Robinson ultimately said that Paradigm and Blast weren\u2019t aligned on certain elements of the rollout, and he felt a need on Paradigm\u2019s behalf to try and advocate for \u201cbest practices\u201d in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing our concerns with the team and appreciate their willingness to engage with us, but there are still many points of disagreement,\u201d Robinson wrote. \u201cWe invest in strong, independent founders who we don\u2019t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,\u201d Robinson concluded.\n\nDecrypt reached out to both Paradigm and Blast for comment, but did not immediately hear back from either side.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Back in 2009, Bitcoin was the only blockchain. Fast-forward 15 years and add tens of billions of dollars of investor cash, and now there are thousands of them.\n\nWith so many different blockchains out there, knowing how to compare them and across what metrics is essential for investors and users alike.\n\nThis article explores how to use DefiLlama to compare blockchains and why doing so matters.\n\nHow to compare blockchains\n\nDefiLlama harvests public data to keep tabs on the inflows and outflows of money across hundreds of blockchains.\n\nTo access it, go to the DefiLlama website and click the Compare Chains tab under the DeFi dashboards section.\n\nUsers can pit blockchains against each other and compare them across several metrics, like total value locked, fees and revenue, active users, and transaction count.\n\nTotal Value Locked\n\nIn the context of blockchains, TVL refers to the total value of cryptocurrency that is deposited into smart contracts on a particular blockchain.\n\nA higher blockchain TVL is usually a reflection of its popularity with investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHowever, TVL can sometimes be misleading.\n\nFor example, Ethereum\u2019s TVL is much higher than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014 even though Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation is triple that of Ethereum.\n\nThe higher TVL is down to Ethereum\u2019s greater support for smart contracts. DeFi protocols built using complex smart contracts, such as decentralised exchanges and lending protocols, have attracted tens of billions of dollars of deposits.\n\nBy contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s TVL is minuscule because of its limited support for smart contracts.\n\nThe total value locked on the Bitcoin blockchain is tiny compared to Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nFees and revenue\n\nWhile TVL is still a great way to gauge a blockchain\u2019s popularity at a glance, looking at other metrics within the Compare Chains dashboard can help create a more complete comparison.\n\nComparing the fees and revenue two blockchains create can yield insights into not only user activity, but also how financially sustainable they are.\n\nLet\u2019s use DefiLlama to compare Ethereum and Optimism.\n\nHere we can see a large portion of Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees go back to the network as revenue \u2014 in Ethereum\u2019s case these fees are burned. On Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 network, a much smaller proportion of its fees are kept as revenue.\n\nOptimism, an Ethereum layer 2, makes less revenue than the blockchain it is built on top of. (DefiLlama)\n\nThat is because Optimism has to pay the Ethereum network it is built on top of to confirm transactions. The majority of transaction fees Optimism charges users are paid to Ethereum, while Optimism keeps what\u2019s left.\n\nEven so, Optimism, along with other Ethereum layer 2 networks, produce millions of dollars of revenue each month.\n\nActive users and transactions\n\nThe Active Users and Transactions metrics are powerful in and of themselves. But when combined they can reveal deeper insights into the behaviour of the users on different blockchains.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s compare the active users on Polygon and Ethereum. On DefiLlama, the active users metric is synonymous with active wallet addresses.\n\nPolygon, a blockchain with lower transaction fees, has more active addresses than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nAs we can see in the example, Polygon has a little over 60,000 more active addresses than Ethereum does.\n\nNext, let\u2019s compare transactions.\n\nPolygon also processes many more transactions than Ethereum. (DefiLlama)\n\nHere we can see Polygon processes almost three times the number of transactions Ethereum does.\n\nNow, let\u2019s combine these two comparisons.\n\nBy dividing daily transactions by daily active addresses on Nov. 15, we find that each Polygon address made an average of 7.7 transactions.\n\nOn Ethereum, however, each address only made an average of 3.5 transactions.\n\nSo, what might be behind this difference? Well, Ethereum transaction fees are much higher than those on Polygon, which could be one influence.\n\nBut be careful when comparing transactions \u2014 not all blockchains allow for a fair comparison.\n\nFor example, Solana\u2019s transaction count is much higher than any other blockchain DefiLlama lists. Is this because Solana users are just more active? Maybe not.\n\nIt\u2019s actually because around 85% of all Solana transactions are from validators communicating with each other every time the network creates a new block. Such transactions happen automatically to keep the blockchain running.\n\nWhy are blockchains different from each other?\n\nAside from popularity and marketing, there are fundamental differences between blockchains based on what they\u2019re trying to achieve.\n\nA lot of what makes a specific blockchain unique can be boiled down to its approach to solving the so-called blockchain trilemma.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma posits that blockchains want to achieve sufficient security, scalability and decentralisation, but can only ever solve any two at the same time by sacrificing the third.\n\nIn the context of blockchains, security, scalability and decentralisation are defined as follows:\n\nSecurity. Some blockchains are better at safeguarding assets and data than others due to different consensus mechanisms \u2013 how blockchain transactions are validated.\n\nSome blockchains are better at safeguarding assets and data than others due to different consensus mechanisms \u2013 how blockchain transactions are validated. Scalability. Some blockchains can handle more transactions than others, making them better suited for sudden surges in use that bring in a tidal wave of traffic.\n\nSome blockchains can handle more transactions than others, making them better suited for sudden surges in use that bring in a tidal wave of traffic. Decentralisation. Some blockchains are more decentralised than others. In more decentralised networks, control and consensus rests in the hands of the community; in less decentralised networks, a smaller group of people call the shots.\n\nA fast blockchain that can process lots of transactions at once might have to sacrifice decentralisation to achieve those high speeds. Conversely, some blockchains sacrifice speed and transaction throughput to maintain higher security.\n\nDecentralisation, though, is what sets blockchains apart from other payment networks. Truly decentralised networks minimise centralised weak points and are more resistant to censorship. The most decentralised blockchains are public blockchains, like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nIn contrast, some networks, known as private blockchains, happily forsake decentralisation for speed and security. These networks, such as the ConsenSys Quorum or Sygnum\u2019s Desygnate, are invite-only.\n\nPrivate blockchains\u2019 security and speed is top-notch, but only for a select group of users. There are usually just a handful of companies that validate and view transactions.\n\nNext steps\n\nCompare active users and transactions across different blockchains and find out which ones have the most active users.\n\nInvestigate different approaches to the blockchain trilemma and read about those who claim to have solved the problem."

Users can earn yields on transferred ether and accumulate BLAST points, which are part of a reward program. This design has contributed significantly to the platform\u2019s attractiveness and rapid accumulation of funds\u200b.\n\nDespite this impressive growth, Blast faces significant challenges, including concerns about opaque governance and restrictions on withdrawals. The platform is currently in an invite-only status, and the mainnet launch is scheduled for February 2024, meaning withdrawals or on-chain activities are restricted until then\u200b\u200b. Over $19 million in ether has been staked on Lido through Blast, and another $3 million is allocated to Maker, highlighting the platform\u2019s diverse investment strategies\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe project, spearheaded by @PacmanBlur, co-founder of the NFT marketplace Blur, aims to extend the Blur ecosystem. This expansion not only provides users with the opportunity to earn yields on idle assets but also focuses on enhancing the technical infrastructure necessary for sophisticated NFT products\u200b\u200b.

Don\u2019t miss out on this exclusive offer; claim your bonus now!\n\nOpaque Governance Structure for Blast Adds Complexities\n\nThe governance structure of Blast also adds another layer of complexity. Control over the platform is vested in a multi-sig contract managed by five anonymous signers. This lack of transparency in governance raises concerns about accountability and trust, particularly in a market where user confidence is critical. Moreover, the absence of features such as a testnet, transaction capabilities, bridges, rollbacks, and sending transaction data to Ethereum further complicates the scenario.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Blast\u2019s architecture has been scrutinized for potential security vulnerabilities. Concerns have been raised about the \u201cenable transition\u201d function and the \u201cmainnetBridge\u201d contract, which, in theory, could allow unrestricted access to all staked ETH and DAI. This presents a significant threat to the security of investors\u2019 assets.\n\nBlast Gets Institutional Interest, Ranks High Among Other L2 Solutions\n\nThe regulatory aspect of Blast and similar projects have also been a topic of discussion among legal experts. The crypto sector has long grappled with the inconsistent application of securities laws. Legal figures have expressed concerns over the disparity in the treatment of various crypto projects, particularly those that might be perceived as publicly marketing securities, including in the U.S. While these concerns do not directly reference Blast, they highlight the challenges in navigating the regulatory landscape for emerging DeFi solutions.\n\nDespite these challenges, the introduction of Blast\u2019s native yield model and its significant achievement in TVL signify a notable advancement in the Layer 2 space. The project, supported by a $20 million investment from entities like Paradigm and Standard Crypto, now ranks sixth among Layer 2 solutions by TVL.\n\nMarc Zeller from Aave has commented on Blast\u2019s situation, noting the significant amount of TVL in Blast\u2019s multisig compared to other ecosystems. His observations underscore the impact of Blast on the broader crypto market, while also hinting at potential issues within the space.\n\nAs Blast navigates rapid growth amidst these emerging challenges, it serves as an example of the broader DeFi landscape\u2014highlighting opportunities for innovation and growth while also emphasizing the need for careful consideration of the associated risks and regulatory uncertainties. This dual aspect of opportunity and challenge in the world of DeFi and cryptocurrency remains a pivotal theme as the market continues to evolve.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends\u2019 Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

Indeed, Buterin spoke in Turkey where he discussed plans that would bring widespread changes to users across the network.\n\nMoreover, Buterin had outlined an overall strategy that he would seek to employ for those changes. Specifically, they would target an enhancement to the staking of ETH, and performance issues that have occurred regarding addresses. The latter has notably been an issue for the network in years past.\n\nSource: CoinDesk\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Says He Hasn\u2019t Sold Ethereum (EHT) Since 2018\n\nButerin Seeking to Implement Widespread Changes to Ethereum\n\nWithin the mainstream perception of digital assets, two tokens reign supreme. Specifically, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have become staples for the industry. Subsequently, those connected to the assets have become some of its most important entities. Now, one of those individuals is set to bring forth massive changes to one network.\n\nSpeaking at Devconnect in Turkey, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delved into his plans to redesign the network. Specifically, Wu Blockchain reported that the changes to the platform are connected to staking and performance concerns. Ultimately, any issues would have widespread changes in the user experience.\n\nVitalik Buterin stated at the Devconnect in Turkey that he plans to redesign Ethereum staking and solve problems affecting performance. He recognizes the UTXO payment model and hopes to integrate private mempools, ERC-4337, code pre-compilation, ZK-EVMs and liquid staking in\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 27, 2023\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Founder Discusses ETH Staking Changes\n\nThe plans Buterin is seeking to set in motion include the integration of private mempools and ERC-4337. Indeed, the former would bring about greater security and privacy to the operating network. This would be done through the authorization of transactions without the intentions being displayed to the public mempool. therefore, they would be far less a target of potential exploits.\n\nSubseuqnlety, ERC-4337 is related to account abstraction, and giving users more control over their own accounts. Therefore, things like multisig wallets become far easier to implement, and far more secure for users. Altogether, these plans are geared toward pushing the network forward and encouraging the protection of users across its operations."

        "content": "At a recent event in Turkey, Ethereum\u2019s cofounder Vitalik Buterin announced his plan to improve Ethereum staking and address performance issues in the network. If implemented, these changes could have a significant impact on users and developers, he added in his speech at Devconnect in Turkey.\n\nButerin said that his vision for Ethereum includes the integration of private mempools and ERC-4337. Private mempools would protect users\u2019 privacy and security by allowing them to conduct transactions without revealing their intentions to the public mempool, where miners could potentially exploit them.\n\nERC-4337 refers to account abstraction, which would give users more control over their accounts and make features like multisig wallets easier to use and more secure.\n\nAnother feature Buterin is considering is code precompilation, which could speed up and reduce the cost of smart contract deployment by preprocessing certain elements of the code. Code precompilation has the potential to make the Ethereum network more efficient and scalable. It can also reduce the number of mistakes made by developers and improve the reliability of smart contracts.\n\nButerin has also proposed improvements to liquid staking, a process that allows users to earn rewards while keeping their assets liquid. However, he has expressed concerns about centralization in current solutions, such as Lido Finance.\n\nTo solve this, Buterin suggests improving the decentralization of liquid staking, giving more users access to the rewards of staking without sacrificing liquidity.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed redesign could have a significant impact on the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially leading to greater scalability, security, and efficiency.\n\nThis could lead to lower transaction fees, faster transaction speeds, and more reliable network performance, making it easier and cheaper for users and developers to participate in the ecosystem.\n\nThe improved usability and lower barriers to entry could attract new users and developers, boosting adoption and potentially driving up the price of Ethereum and other assets within the ecosystem.\n\nRead also: SBI Holdings partners with Circle for USDC circulation and web3 services"

        "content": "A new player has entered the crypto scene with enticing features and good potential. That player is Meme Moguls (MGLS). The token which is just in the presale stage has surpassed the performance of great giants like Ethereum and Ripple.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Shows Sell Signal, Says Ali Martinez\n\nEthereum (ETH) started this week on a bullish note rising above the $2,000 mark as high as $2,128. Unfortunately, Ethereum\u2019s price has dipped to $2,000. Currently, various indicators suggest the likelihood of further declines in the coming days.\n\nEven crypto traders like Ali Martinez share this opinion. According to Ali, Ethereum\u2019s \u201cTD Sequential\u201d indicator is signaling a sell on the three-day Ethereum price chart. This comes as the asset tests a significant resistance range ranging from $2,000 to $2,150.\n\nThe analyst pointed at a possible price dump to $1,700. Currently, the price of Ethereum is showing mixed sentiment. It had dropped 2% on the daily chart while holding on to gains of 6.5% and 27.3% on the weekly and monthly Ethereum chart.\n\nRipple (XRP) Loses Gains After Recent XRP ETF Rumour\n\nRipple holders\u2019 positive outlook has grown immensely since Ripple\u2019s partial win against the US SEC in July. Ripple\u2019s price increased by over 80% and reached the $0.8 level. Unfortunately, the bearish market led to high selling pressure as Ripple cryptocurrency lost its gains.\n\nThe Ripple crypto dropped as low as $0.5 before picking pace during the Uptober market rally. So far, Ripple coin\u2019s November performance has been poor compared to other cryptocurrencies. Per CoinMarketCap, Ripple XRP price has dipped 3.4% to $0.6387.\n\nBoth its market cap and trading volume have dropped significantly, due to the recent fake BlackRock XRP ETF Trust filing. Still, Ripple\u2019s technical indicators point towards a price recovery in the coming months to the $0.7 region.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS), Bringing New Utility To the Meme Coin Sector\n\nWhile Ethereum and XRP are losing gains, meme coins continue to take over the crypto space. The meme-based asset industry has gained significant recognition in recent years. According to Statistics, the meme coin sector has a market capitalization of over $17.5 billion.\n\nThe interesting part is that these meme coins have little to no utility. In response to this, Meme Moguls has emerged as a solution, as it seeks to launch a meme-backed stock market. The project\u2019s objective is to unite the meme industry to foster a community for meme coin enthusiasts.\n\nUsers will gain access to memes-backed assets. The ecosystem will also encompass a wide range of services, all drawing inspiration from memes. A metaverse platform named Mogul Land will be introduced. This will enable meme traders to interact and mine tokens to enhance their returns.\n\nAnalysts have predicted significant growth for the MGLS token. Currently, Meme lovers have the opportunity to buy MGLS tokens at just $0.0019. Market experts are optimistic about the project and foresee a 1,000% increase in the coming months. Plus, joining the presale gives you a chance to earn up to $10,000 in giveaways at the end of the presale stage.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "title": "How to transfer cryptocurrencies from Polygon ZkEVM to other blockchains: native bridge and external protocols - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we look at how to transfer crypto assets from the Polygon ZkEVM network, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 solution, to other blockchains using the native bridge platform and other third-party applications.\n\nNative bridging involves depositing ETH or other cryptocurrencies compulsorily from the Ethereum network to the Polygon rollup network.\n\nWith external protocols, on the other hand, we can freely go through other chains performing transactions almost always faster and cheaper, but at the cost of less data security.\n\nThe latter, in fact, add increased counterparty risk because we are going to entrust an entity not controlled by Polygon with the task of transferring assets from one network to another.\n\nHence, which is the best option to choose? Let\u2019s look at it below.\n\nWhat is Polygon zkEVM?\n\nPolygon zkEVM is an Ethereum layer-2 of the ZK-rollup type that offers fast, cheap and secure transactions.\n\nZero-knowledge technology is combined with the robustness of Ethereum to achieve a highly efficient network with a focus on stability and EVM compatibility.\n\nTransactions executed on the zk network pass through Ethereum, but are confirmed off-chain to allow high throughput at low cost.\n\nDevelopers of protocols built on the Polygon-branded layer-2 have an advantage over the rest of the blockchain landscape because they can boast of the Ethereum virtual machine compatibility factor that allows for maximum interoperability between parties.\n\nOn the bridge front, this factor allows users to easily transfer assets from one chain to another without special arrangements. The same goes for those who want to migrate their dapp without having to entirely rewrite the code with different languages.\n\nThe cryptographic asset used as a gas token in the network is currently ETH, but not in the future this privilege is expected to pass to POL (ex-MATIC) upon completion of its integration process.\n\nThe Polygon ZkEVM infrastructure was launched in March 2023 and can already count on a locked-in value within it of about $100 million.\n\nThe next-generation chain was created with the intention of meeting the growing demand for decentralized applications and users in the Web3 world, and it has already achieved its small success by ranking within the top10 rollups for TVL according to L2Beat.\n\nIf you would like to discuss this further, all of Polygon ZKEVM\u2019s core principles and the ecosystem roadmap version 2.0 roadmap were published in a recent Polygon Labs blog post\n\n1/ Our vision for Polygon is simple: to build the Value Layer of the Internet.\n\n\n\nThe Internet allows anyone to create and exchange information. The Value Layer allows anyone to create, exchange, and program value.\n\n\n\nEnter Polygon 2.0: a blueprint to build the ultimate Value Layer. pic.twitter.com/9eYSr3H1L5 \u2014 Polygon (Labs) (@0xPolygonLabs) June 12, 2023\n\nPolygon Bridge: native cross-chain transfer between Polygon ZkEVM to other blockchains\n\nThe first way to transfer crypto from Polygon ZkEVM to other blockchains is to use the decentralized infrastructure\u2019s native bridge.\n\nIn fact, the Polygon team has provided its own platform to allow users to deposit ETH and other assets within the new network, without going through external applications.\n\nAs anticipated, the native bridge only supports the Ethereum blockchain and hence only allows cross-chain operations of ERC-20 tokens, such as ETH, USDT, USDC, DAI, MATIC, AAVE, LINK, WBTC, etc.\n\nAll this results in significantly above-average fees and waiting time costs compared to other more scalable L2s and L1s.\n\nIn any case, this is the safest and most efficient solution to land on the Polygon ZkEVM and the one definitely to be preferred in case large volumes move.\n\nThe Polygon Bridge is available from this site: to use it simply connect your non-custodial wallet (Metamask, TrustWallet, Zerion, Rainbow), select the token you want to transfer, select the quantity and click on \u201cstart bridging.\u201d\n\nThe transaction requires confirmation of the smart contract and payment of a fee of about $10-12 according to current gas prices on Ethereum.\n\nTo withdraw funds from the ZK network, the process is essentially the same, with the only catch being that the networks must be reversed for transfer using the appropriate symbol in the center of the bridge.\n\nOther third-party bridges\n\nAs mentioned, there are also several third-party bridges that serve as alternative platforms for moving our crypto to and from the Polygon ZkEVM network.\n\nThese bridges offer the ability to go through different infrastructures choosing the one most convenient for our operation, often paying lower fees and with minimal waiting times.\n\nHence, unlike the Polygon Bridge, here we can enjoy the wide choice offered by the blockchain landscape such as Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Starknet, ZkSync, Linea, Immutable, Polygon chain, Avalanche, Base, and many others.\n\nOf course, this advantage is offset with a downside: all these third-party services in fact, although they are a faster and more immediate option in cross-chain exchanges, present far higher structural risks than native bridges.\n\nBy using them you are automatically going to entrust your assets to services that have nothing to do with Polygon and Ethereum, and that may have flaws on the security front. You are essentially going to increase counterparty risk.\n\nPeople usually choose these more flexible solutions when they want to bridging small amounts .\n\nAmong the most well-known and reliable third-party protocols in this field are Orbiter Finance, Layerswap, XY Finance, and Celer Bridge.\n\nEach has small peculiarities such as supporting a specific chain, allowing transfers with a particular token, or integrating support for transfers from CEX.\n\nEither way, they all work similarly to the native bridge: to use you then need to connect your wallet, select a coin to transfer, type in the amount, and click the button to start the transaction\n\nYou can find references to these platforms, and other niche services, directly on the Polygon Bridge page under \u201cThird.Party Bridges.\u201d"

Discover SCENE\n\nMagic Eden sees a crypto future that spans multiple blockchains\u2014and is launching its crypto wallet browser extension in closed beta to support that aim, the firm behind the NFT marketplace announced Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a multi-chain world for NFTs,\u201d Magic Eden CEO and co-founder Jack Lu told Decrypt in an interview.\n\n\u201cUp until today, for a user to really experience all the different products and features and great content that we have on every chain, they effectively have to download three wallets,\u201d Lu said of the current challenges plaguing the wallet space that have led to user fragmentation on Magic Eden.\n\nThe marketplace\u2019s crypto wallet is launching for the Google Chrome browser first, but a Safari browser version and mobile app are also in the works. The mobile app could come into fruition as soon as early 2024, Lu shared.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wallet will be compatible with the four blockchains that Magic Eden currently supports on its NFT marketplace: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\nThe initial Magic Eden wallet will be self-custodied, meaning users will have full control over their crypto assets and will have to keep a seed phrase\u2014a lengthy passphrase consisting of many words\u2014secure.\n\nBut if downloading three different crypto wallets to buy NFTs on Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin is frustrating and cumbersome for users, why still make them deal with seed phrases at all? Why not offer a Magic Eden-custodied wallet with a one-click email solution instead?\n\nLu said that holding your own crypto and NFTs is crucial to \u201cthe ethos of Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIntroducing Magic Eden Wallet, a wallet made for Magic Eden users and cross-chain collectors.

For instance, when users have multiple wallets installed\u2014like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, or the Ronin Wallet, for example\u2014they can occasionally \u201cfight\u201d each other to connect to a website, simultaneously popping up at once and creating connection issues and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe're actually working pretty deeply right now to make sure that the wallets don't fight each other as much,\u201d Lu said, citing Magic Eden\u2019s work on its wallet with crypto tech firm Exodus.\n\nIn addition to cross-chain swaps, the Magic Eden wallet will also offer users the ability to buy crypto with fiat currency from within the wallet through a MoonPay integration, Lu said. The wallet will include NFT-focused features like cross-chain portfolio tracking, Bitcoin Ordinals support, and simultaneous connection to multiple blockchains.\n\n\u201cI think self-custody and email login\u2014and those seamless implementations\u2014they're not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lu told Decrypt of the wallet\u2019s potential future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very exciting technologies that we're looking to tap into to make that onboarding experience much more smooth, much more familiar to the mainstream user.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Step Aside Bitcoin and Ether, GameStop Memes Is the Crypto You Can't Afford To Miss - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Learn about the tempting financial potential that GameStop Memes offers in the middle of the rising Bitcoin and Ether Option activity.\n\nOpportunities emerge from the most unlikely tales in the world of cryptocurrencies. The growth of GameStop Memes (GSM), a coin inspired by the legendary Wall Street Memes narrative, is one such story that has enthralled the crypto market. As the notional open interest of active Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts on Deribit reaches a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, now is the time to look into why GameStop Memes is a great investment opportunity in today's crypto scene.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Drive The Scene\n\nBefore we get into GameStop Memes, it's important to understand the context in which this crypto gem is set. The notionally open interest in Bitcoin and Ether options contracts has skyrocketed, according to Deribit, a large cryptocurrency exchange. As reported by Swiss-based Laevitas, this sum has already reached a mind-boggling $20.64 billion, virtually matching the peak set in November 2021, when Bitcoin was selling at an eye-popping $66,000.\n\nIt's worth noting that the current open interest in these contracts substantially outnumbers that of November 2021. With nearly twice the number of outstanding contracts, it's not just a triumph for Deribit, but also a strong indication of the cryptocurrency market's expansion and increased interest in options.\n\nWhere It All Began\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the show's main attraction - GameStop Memes. It all started in early 2021, when retail traders banded together to support GameStop, defying Wall Street's hegemony. This game-changing campaign demonstrated to the globe that the masses could, in fact, take on the financial system. GameStop Memes sprang from this maelstrom of events.\n\nGameStop Memes is here to carry on the tradition, representing the original GameStop movement's spirit of rebellion, solidarity, and humour. This token is about more than simply investing; it's about making a commitment to the future, about democratising finance and offering tools for financial empowerment and education.\n\nThe unique strategy of GameStop Memes distinguishes it in the enormous ocean of cryptocurrencies. It combines memes with finance to make investing more approachable and pleasurable. So, what makes GameStop Memes such an appealing investment potential in today's crypto environment? Let's look more closely:\n\nA Tribute To GameStop\n\nGameStop Memes celebrates the legendary GameStop movement. It is a sign of opposition to traditional structures that frequently exclude individuals. This homage keeps the communal spirit alive and well.\n\nCommunity-Driven Approach\n\nUnlike many cryptocurrencies, GameStop Memes places the community at the centre of its operations. It seeks to unite people all around the world with a common objective to democratise finances and provide resources for financial empowerment and education.\n\nSecure And Transparent\n\nIn the crypto realm, transparency and security are crucial. GameStop Memes achieves both by providing a safe environment for its users while retaining operational openness. This degree of confidence is priceless in the crypto world.\n\nInnovative Tokenomics\n\nGameStop Memes aren't only about making money in the near run. Its revolutionary tokenomics are intended to assure long-term involvement and stability. This emphasis on sustainability distinguishes it from many other speculative coins on the market.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nGameStop Memes offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of something bigger, something that celebrates the strength of the community and the lighter side of finance. While notional open interest in Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on Deribit continues to rise, GameStop Memes serves as a timely reminder that the unexpected may frequently produce the most substantial returns in the crypto realm. Don't miss out on this revolutionary adventure, invest in GameStop Memes and become a part of the movement that is redefining financial rules.\n\nGameStop Memes\n\nWebsite: https://gamestmemes.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameStopMemes\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/GameStopMemes"

        "content": "Not long after sharing the details regarding the decentralization of the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of its blockchain development firm Input Output Global (IOG), has criticized Ethereum (ETH) plans for staking structure redesign shared by the platform\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nAs it happens, Hoskinson took a jab at Ethereum as he commented on a video of Buterin admitting to the overly centralized nature of current staking on the platform and describing plans to redesign its staking operations in an X post shared by user Stake with Pride on November 24.\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nFurthermore, responding to the comment noting that he was \u201cfuelling hostility\u201d with Ethereum, Hoskinson refuted such observations, arguing that Vitalik was \u201crediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation,\u201d adding that it was \u201cextraordinary that we never get a shout-out.\u201d\n\nCardano vs. Ethereum decentralization\n\nAs a reminder, the Cardano founder had poked fun at Buterin and his ideas before as well, like in early October, when the Ethereum pioneer shared a post listing the advantages of suggested changes in staking design for users who do not have enough resources to stake on their own.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson recently revealed Cardano\u2019s upcoming moves toward the \u201cfull-blown\u201d decentralized governance structure as it enters the Voltaire era in its roadmap, including through the movements of all repositories to a community-run project called Intersect, as Finbold reported on November 17.\n\nElsewhere, Cardano\u2019s ADA token was at press time trading at the price of $0.381, which shows a decline of 2.50% on the day and a loss of 2.83% across the previous week while it still holds onto the gain of 30.08% on its monthly chart, according to the data on November 27.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson, the founder of the Cardano network and former Ethereum developer, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to share his view on Ethereum\u2019s approach to blockchain innovations that the Cardano team is already developing.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nOn November 24, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was interviewed by DeFi and NFT platform Defiant in Turkey, where he discussed the Ethereum roadmap and proposed redesigning Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) staking system to promote healthier mining and staking pools, thereby enhancing decentralization.\n\nDuring the interview, Buterin talked about adopting the UTXO approach, which relies on unspent transactions to address the network\u2019s challenges. Notably, this model is different from Ethereum\u2019s current account-based system and is used by some blockchains, such as Cardano and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is UTXO?\n\nThe Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) is the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed. This model provides users with enhanced control over their financial transactions, especially crucial for issues like preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nBy allowing users to specify and understand exactly who they are receiving funds from, the UTXO model aims to bring a higher degree of traceability and security to financial transactions, a level of control and transparency that is increasingly important in our digital age.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s and Community Response\n\nIn response to Buterin\u2019s interview, the crypto community pointed out that this solution is similar to the approach Cardano has already taken with its staking system. Hoskinson also responded to the interview by tweeting a notably sarcastic remark. He wrote:\n\n\u201cNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\u201d\n\nUpon seeing Hoskinson\u2019s tweet, a user in the community criticized him saying he was \u201cfueling hostilities\u201d. The Cardano founder replied that his tweet bore no negative feelings but rather an expression of his confusion. He added:\n\n\u201cI am truly at a loss that Cardano can never be mentioned as an innovative ecosystem over team E. V is rediscovering what we\u2019ve been working on for almost a decade, and it\u2019s like a new revelation.\u201d\n\nHoskinson\u2019s recent criticism of Ethereum\u2019s staking system is not the first. Earlier this year, he stated that he was at a \u201closs for words\u2019 regarding a statement by Buterin on ETH staking."
