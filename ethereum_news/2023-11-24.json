        "title": "Ethereum stakers \u2018terrified\u2019 of slashing. Company coalition looks to make it nearly impossible - DLNews",
        "content": "Slashing is a constant concern for Ethereum staking providers.\n\nCompany Cubist wants to use abstraction to prevent accidental slashing.\n\nDoing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nBitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, encountered a serious problem earlier this month \u2014 a problem that unsettles other Ethereum stakers as well.\n\nIts newly deployed Ethereum validators \u2014 software that helps process transactions and secure the network in return for newly minted Ether \u2014 began getting \u201cslashed,\u201d a term that refers to taking some Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish the correct data to the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the course of almost two hours, nearly 100 of the firm\u2019s validators were knocked offline and fined one Ether each \u2014 an almost $200,000 loss at current prices \u2014 for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nBitcoin Suisse did not immediately return DL News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nWhile slashing exists to punish people who try to attack or cheat Ethereum\u2019s validation system, it more commonly happens because of code bugs or human error.\n\nSince Ethereum started allowing users to stake in 2020, validators on the network have been slashed 400 times, per beaconcha.in data.\n\nWhile the financial damage caused by slashing on Ethereum has historically been much smaller than the losses from hacks or DeFi protocol bugs, many crypto security researchers worry that an event where thousands of validators are simultaneously slashed is a serious risk.\n\nAnd as the Ether staking market swelled to over $57 billion this year, that risk has only become more troubling.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBitcoin Suisse is not the only Ethereum staking provider to suffer from slashing recently. In October, 20 Ethereum validators controlled by Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol with over $18.5 billion of deposits, were slashed, resulting in a $30,000 hit. That incident was not the first time Lido\u2019s validators were slashed this year.\n\nLido's deposits climbed higher over the past year as Ethereum staking popularity soared\n\n\u201cEven very sophisticated experienced validator operators are still getting slashed,\u201d Ann Stefan, co-founder and COO of Cubist, a blockchain key management platform, told DL News in an interview.\n\n\u201cHaving best practices in place can really help prevent the incidence of these types of things from happening,\u201d Stefan said.\n\nBecause slashing can occur so easily, the fear of it happening is palpable among staking providers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all terrified of this,\u201d Fraser Brown, co-founder and CTO of Cubist, told DL News. \u201cThe way people get slashed in practice most of the time is they just make mistakes with their infrastructure.\u201d\n\nCubist has teamed up with 16 other crypto firms and protocols including Redacted, Swell, and EigenLayer to form the Secure Staking Alliance, a cross-industry partnership with the goal of making crypto staking more secure.\n\nWithin the alliance, Cubist is trying to solve the problem of slashing once and for all by making it almost impossible for stakers to be slashed accidentally.\n\nBut doing so skirts a fine line between keeping blockchains secure and making sure stakers are not unfairly punished.\n\nSlashing serves an important purpose by protecting Ethereum from attack. But the stringent security comes with a downside \u2014 it\u2019s easy for honest stakers to be slashed if they make a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe ended up with this tension where the fundamental security mechanism of Ethereum is actually the fundamental insecurity mechanism for validator node operators,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSolving slashing\n\nCubist\u2019s solution to accidental slashing is to create a layer of abstraction that validators must go through to sign off on the data they send to the Ethereum network.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum are very similar to databases where the current state must follow on from the previous state. If a validator tries to publish an incorrect state it gets slashed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a database. The problem is databases are actually kind of hard,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re running a whole bunch of validators, you have to have a global scalable database for every validator key. That\u2019s something you can get wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat Cubist proposes is that all validator clients must send messages to another piece of software \u2014 which Brown refers to as a \u201csky key\u201d \u2014 that is better equipped to make sure the validator\u2019s messages contain the correct data.\n\nAccording to Brown, as long as the sky key has serious slashing protection, the validators that rely on it will also be safe.\n\n\u201cYou just have to get all the hard database stuff right once and then all requests just go through that key,\u201d Brown said.\n\nTo make sure multiple validators aren\u2019t relying on the same abstracted key, Cubist deploys a separate instance for each validator. \u201cIf you have 100 validators there are 100 keys in the sky. One for each,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBeyond Ethereum staking\n\nWhile Cubist\u2019s slashing solution is most relevant to Ethereum, the most popular proof of stake blockchain, it is also relevant to other areas of staking.\n\nOne area which has previously drawn concern from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is restaking \u2014 an upcoming blockchain feature that will allow users to double-stake their Ether on other protocols and blockchains.\n\nCubist has signed partnerships with both EigenLayer and Babylon \u2014 two restaking protocols \u2014 specifically to focus on protecting their ecosystems from slashing.\n\nAccording to Stefan, protocols like these all have unique slashing conditions, which presents an additional layer of complexity. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important to have anti-slashers in place on these risk taking protocols,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while Stefan and Brown say they are confident in Cubist\u2019s anti-slashing standards, they are also mindful of the risk of having all stakers rely on only their specific implementations.\n\n\u201cThe standards are not saying, \u2018You must use this setup, you must use this hardware,\u2019\u201d Stefan said. The message is, she added, here\u2019s how to set up your infrastructure if you want to have the best chance of not messing up.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Binance Set To Remove Bitcoin & Ethereum Pairs From Nov 28 - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has recently announced its decision to delist Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] cross-margin and isolated margin pairs. This strategic move, effective November 28, is part of the crypto exchange\u2019s proactive approach to addressing the increasing legal challenges within the digital asset industry.\n\nThe impacted pairs are directly linked to BUSD, a stablecoin created in collaboration with Paxos. The suspension of isolated margin borrowing on these pairs is set to occur on November 28, followed by the closure of auto-settled user positions and the cancellation of pending orders on December 7. This decision comes in response to allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which previously classified BUSD as a security.\n\nBinance Set To Remove Bitcoin & Ethereum Pairs From Nov 28 3\n\nIn response to this classification, both Paxos and Binance promptly ceased further minting and circulation of the stablecoin, aligning with the ongoing efforts of crypto exchanges to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nEarlier this week, CZ pleaded guilty and is set to stand trial for charges related to operating an unlicensed money transfer business, conspiracy, and violating restrictions, resulting in a substantial $4.3 billion fine for Binance. As the cryptocurrency space grapples with these regulatory challenges, the implications for the market remain uncertain. The delisting of major pairs and the leadership change at Binance underscore the mounting regulatory pressures faced by crypto exchanges globally, marking a pivotal moment for the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, according to data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin reserves are shifting from Binance to Coinbase. As of November 22, Coinbase\u2019s reserves have surged by almost 12,000 BTC, while Binance\u2019s have declined by 5,000 BTC, as noted by the research firm in a recent report. Analysts attribute the decrease in Bitcoin reserves to retail outflows.\n\nBinance\u2019s Bitcoin Reserves Drop\n\nConcurrently, some market experts speculate that Binance\u2019s recent settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice could be the final hurdle for obtaining approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF, influencing fund flows.\n\nCryptoQuant identified a 1,000 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase, with suggestions that the transaction represents an \u201cinstitutional over-the-counter [OTC] trade and can be seen as anticipation of approval of ETFs.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, CryptoQuant\u2019s data reveals a consistent decrease in bitcoin reserves on exchanges throughout the year, considered a bullish indicator. However, certain analysts argue that since the collapse of FTX last year, trust in centralized exchanges has waned, prompting investors to store their holdings elsewhere."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFounder of IOG and Cardano, billionaire Charles Hoskinson, who took part in the creation of Ethereum together with Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and several other individuals, has commented on Buterin's recent ideas about how to improve the centralized Ethereum staking. Cardano founder's comment about Buterin's ideas was pretty sarcastic, though.\n\nButerin wants to redesign Ethereum staking, Hoskinson reacts\n\nIn a recent interview of Vitalik Buterin in Turkey, where he answered questions from the local community, he talked about the Ethereum road map. In particular, Buterin touched on the topic of Ethereum staking as he said that \"there is something to be done about staking centralization.\"\n\nIn particular, he mentioned current issues with multiple staking pools and \"solo staking being hard,\" summarizing that these issues and others about it are \"not really healthy.\" Buterin is considering introducing a redesign to the staking system on his blockchain. As one of the possible solutions here, the Ethereum frontman is considering the UTxO approach, which is based on unspent transactions.\n\nCharles Hoskinson's sarcastic reaction to that was, \"No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted! https://t.co/Td0Hm58eic \u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 24, 2023\n\nThis is not the first time that Buterin has spoken about the need to redesign the staking system of Ethereum. Earlier this year, Hoskinson and the Cardano army have several times criticized him for admitting certain inconveniences that the staking system adopted by Ethereum bears and slammed Buterin for considering introducing features that Cardano had implemented already to make ADA staking easier for its users.\n\nWhales stocking up on ETH in big way\n\nAccording to prominent whale transactions tracking platform Whale Alert, over the past 30 hours, several massive chunks of Ethereum have been withdrawn from three major crypto exchanges: Bitfinex, Binance and Coincheck.\n\nAnonymous whales have removed 50,000 ETH, 15,000 and 33,330 ETH from these platforms to their cold wallets, respectively. These lumps of Ethereum are evaluated at a massive $105,740,324, $31,138,359 and $68,795,390.\n\nBesides, another anonymous wallet withdrew 1,498 ETH worth $3.13 million earlier today from Binance, while ETH traded at $2,089. Per @OnchainDataNerd blockchain sleuth account, within the past couple of days, this whale has accumulated 4,770 ETH in total, paying $2,079 per coin on average.\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that currently, whales are going on a big Ethereum buying spree. He shared a chart showing that within the last nine days, big ETH holders have been accumulating large amounts of ETH for the first time in the past nine months. He considers this to be a bullish signal for the second-largest crypto."

The whale wallet holdings have climbed 30.3% since November 21, 2022, based on Santiment data. These large wallet investors\u2019 holdings represent 52% of the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply, therefore whale wallet activity is likely to have a direct impact on the asset\u2019s price.\n\n94,700 new Ethereum wallets that were created on November 21, mark the largest spike since July 2023, and support the narrative of ETH price gains.\n\nETH whale accumulation\n\nData from on-chain tracker Glassnode reveals that for the first time in the past nine months, large wallet addresses have accumulated the altcoin steadily. The nine month accumulation spree is therefore likely to strengthen ETH price uptrend. It represents increasing buying pressure from whales.\n\nAs seen in the Glassnode chart below, both whale address count and addresses with balance greater than 10,000 ETH observed a spike since November 14.\n\nEthereum whale address count and price\n\nThe asset rallied past a key resistance zone between $1,899 and $2,052, where 4.9 million ETH wallet addresses scooped up 41.35 million Ether tokens. At the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,080.19. The altcoin faces minimal resistance, in the zone between $2,141 and $2,505. ETH finds strong support in the $1,899 to $2,052 zone, consistent demand from large wallet investors could therefore push the altcoin to new yearly highs.\n\nGlobal In/Out of the Money\n\nEthereum price yielded 6% weekly gains and 16% gains for holders in the past month."

        "content": "Blast, a newly introduced Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 network promising \u201cnative yield\u201d on ETH and stablecoin holdings, swiftly secured the position of the third-largest holder of staked ether in just three days post-launch, according to on-chain data.\n\nEtherscan data indicates that the platform has amassed over 140,000 staked Ethereum, valued at approximately $286 million, utilizing the liquid staking protocol Lido since its inception on Nov. 20. This accumulation represents roughly 1.5% of the total staked Ether volume.\n\nDebank\u2019s data further shows that the protocol\u2019s multi-sig wallet currently holds assets worth more than $335 million, comprising Lido\u2019s staked Ether and MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin DAI.\n\nControversy Surrounds Blast\u2019s Pyramid-Like System\n\nHowever, the rapid growth of Blast over the past three days has triggered strong criticism within the crypto community due to its pyramid-like Blast points system, which rewards early users based on the number of users they refer.\n\nDetails on the project\u2019s website outline that users receive an additional 16% of points when their referrals bring in more participants and an extra 8% if the subsequent level brings in additional users.\n\nAn intriguing aspect is that the inflows into the protocol remain one-directional, with no option for withdrawal until its slated launch in February next year.\n\nSimon Dedic, the CEO and managing partner of crypto investment firm MoonRock Capital, stated that Blast\u2019s unique selling point is its \u201cPonzi airdrop farming.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201c[To be honest] Blast_L2 is the perfect illustration of why non-crypto people hate Web3. [It is not]a technical advancement to any of the other L2s, nor does it offer any exciting applications to use on top of it. While disabling withdrawals.\u201d\n\nBesides its Ponzi-like structure, attention has been drawn to Blast\u2019s multi-sig wallet.\n\nPolygon engineer Jarrod Watts believes the protocol needs 3 out of 5 signatories to authorize suspicious actions. Watts highlighted that the addresses associated are new and have unknown identities.\n\nHowever, despite the inherent risks, Watts doubts the possibility of fund theft.\n\nSimilarly, Cos, the founder of SlowMist, noted that Blast operates as an upgradeable contract with a 3/5 multi-signature setup and lacks a time lock.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "BLAST: Ethereum\u2019s new layer-2 with a planned crypto airdrop - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we introduce a new layer-2 of Ethereum that is scheduled to release an airdrop in May 2024: we are talking about Blast, an infrastructure that looks to be the first to offer native yield for crypto such as ETH and stablecoin.\n\nTo date, the chain has not yet been launched and it is, in fact, impossible to bridging funds within it.\n\nHowever, we can deposit ETH in a multi-signature wallet that will, on the one hand, guarantee us a yield from here to the coming months, and on the other hand, give us the opportunity to participate in airdrop.\n\nParadigm and Standard Crypto, two well-known investment signatures in the crypto world, have funded the project with $20 million given its potential that could completely revolutionize the Ethereum L2 landscape.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what it is all about and find out how to get airdrop.\n\nBLAST: Ethereum\u2019s first layer-2 offering native yield of ETH and stablecoin\n\nBlast is a new layer-2 ZK from Ethereum of the optimistic rollup type, which promises its users yields that beat dollar inflation simply by holding tokens on the crypto network, as well as offering an airdrop-style rewards campaign.\n\nIn detail, Blast presents itself as the first compatible EVM infrastructure capable of granting native ETH and stablecoin yields.\n\nBasically, those who hold a balance of these cryptos within the L2 passively get interest that is generated by going to Lido staking and MakerDAO, in a fully automated way and without the need for external actions.\n\nIt should also be noted that the project team has planned to donate the entire proceeds of fees recorded on the chain to all decentralized application developers, so as to incentivize the development of successful products.\n\nAt this time the chain is still under development, with the mainnet being launched in February and airdrops being unlocked about 2 months later.\n\nFor now, one cannot in fact bridging crypto within it but only deposit ETH and other stables at a multi-signature wallet that is a real safe for early adopters of the project.\n\nThere appears to be no testnet or mainnet readiness phases.\n\nWell-known crypto investment signatures Paradigm and Standard Crypto have been personally present at Blast\u2019s funding, leading a $20 million round.\n\nOther companies and private entities participated in the development of the project: these include names such as eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, and Jeff Lo.\n\nGiven the presence of major players on this list, who have funded infrastructure that has released voluminous airdrops in the past, we expect the same to happen for Blast.\n\nOn the other hand, the names of the team for the new rollup are not yet known: all we know is that they come from prestigious institutions such as the FAANG, Yale, MIT, Nanyang Technological University, Seoul National University, and that they have worked for some popular web3 and DeFi protocols particularly active on Ethereum and Solana.\n\nThe premise for Blast seems to be respectable: given the backgound of the project and the next-generation architecture of the chain we could easily see this layer-2 compete with the major players in the cryptographic industry in the coming years.\n\nLet us not forget, however, that to date Blast has created NOTHING yet: being too optimistic about a premature product could turn out to be a completely wrong approach such that it leads to an overstated interpretation of reality.\n\nIntroducing Blast: The only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve raised $20m from @Paradigm and @StandardCrypto to build the L2 that helps you earn more.\n\n\n\nDetails on how to get early access at the end of the thread\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/AYYmK8YFx4 \u2014 Blast (@Blast_L2) November 20, 2023\n\nHow to participate in BLAST\u2019s crypto airdrop\n\nTo participate in Blast\u2019s crypto airdrop, the first thing to do is to retrieve an invitation code because access to the platform in its \u201cearly access\u201d phase is limited.\n\nThe easiest way to find one is to search for it on X by selecting the keywords \u201cBlast code\u201d in the search bar and scrolling through the various user posts and browsing through the comments.\n\nThere are many invitation codes available because to maximize airdrop, the community tries to invite as many users as possible to join their \u201cteam.\u201d\n\nOnce we get a valid code, all we have to do is deposit ETH, stETH or stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, USDT.\n\nBe careful because these funds will remain locked until February 2024, at which time the Blast mainnet will be realized.\n\nIn return we will get an annualized yield of about 4-5%, as well as points that will entitle us to collect airdrop.\n\nThe rewards program is organized in the same style as Friend.Tech, which includes gamified elements within it to provide a \u201cfun\u201d investment experience.\n\nIf you plan to lock your funds into Blast to participate in the airdrop, the advice is to deposit crypto worth at least $1,000.\n\nIn just 48 hours since its launch, this platform has raised about $230 million from a total of more than 37,000 users. Understand for yourself that the competition here is very high, hence allocating a few hundred dollars to the project may not bring the desired results.\n\nThen consider that just for fees on Ethereum we will spend a minimum of $15-20 between deposit and withdrawal.\n\nImmediately after making your first deposit you can start sharing your invitation code within the network of contacts you are part of (before depositing you do not get an invitation code).\n\nThe more crypto deposited by individuals who sign up with your code, the more points you can get and consequently the larger the final airdrop.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, share codes initially only with those you know have the financial readiness to deposit substantial amounts of ETH or stablecoin ( codes only limited at first).\n\nAs you move forward with your score you will reach a level where you can share your code endlessly, and hence only at that point will it become a wise idea to spam it everywhere on all existing social media.\n\nTo get to that point your team (you and everyone you invited) will have to deposit at least 20 ETH. You can view your progress through a dedicated airdrop leaderboard.\n\nThe logic of the invitations follows somewhat the same ponzinomics concepts typical of projects that incentivize sharing and engagement among communities.\n\nBlur and other projects also exhibit similar lineaments, where the greater the contribution of your lines the greater your personal gain.\n\nTo be honest, this system does not represent the absolute best system for launching an airdrop and may prove inconvenient for some if you are not part of a close crypto degen community.\n\nAlso, the fact that a multi-signature wallet with 3 out of 5 signatures needed to approve transactions is handling the treasury of deposits does not reassure and still raises many questions about what to do.\n\nIn any case, it is worth mentioning that as backers on Blast there are renowned names who have collaborated on other projects in the past that have released very high value airdrops, sometimes even exceeding $10,000.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that blocking one\u2019s funds for Blast airdrop presents its own not insignificant risks, but at the same time the whole thing could turn out to be extremely profitable in the future."

        "title": "What is Blast: the million-dollar Ethereum L2 cofounded by Blur - OKX",
        "content": "If you're someone who prefers to HODL their portfolio for the long haul, staking and generating passive yield may be at the top of your agenda. With so many staking protocols to choose from, you'll practically be spoilt for choice, as they potentially bring satisfying rewards and security that reassures you of your staking decision.\n\nRecently, an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution that allegedly offers native yield has been making a splash in the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene. Enter Blast: the L2 solution with over $300 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and 50,000 users as of November 2023. As an ever-growing pool of users are hopping aboard the Blast bandwagon, it begs the question \u2014 are these benefits too good to be true?\n\nFrom explaining Blast as an L2 solution to digging deeper into its smart contract specifics, here's everything to know about Blast and its explosive overnight success as an Ethereum L2 solution.\n\nWhat is Blast?\n\nAs the market's only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins, Blast is the result of Blur's founder Tieshun Roquerre recognizing a need for a new L2 optimistic rollup solution with native yield. While Blast is still in early access, it's attracted the attention of yield hunters due to its promises of up to 5% and more. This is thanks to extra Blast rewards in the form of USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin. USDB can then be swapped to USDC once Blast rewards are distributed in May 2024.\n\nHow does Blast work?\n\nWith rewards of up to 5%, one has to wonder where Blast is getting this yield from. To quell the worries of Blast skeptics, Roquerre has been fully transparent with the way the bridged stablecoins and ETH are being handled. In a public Blast thread on X, the L2 optimistic rollup solution has clearly stated its yield sources. Here's a breakdown of how Blast works and how users will interact with the L2 solution:\n\nUsers can deposit ETH, stETH, DAI, USDC or USDT. These deposits are locked until February 2024, when Blast's mainnet and DApps go live.\n\nUSDT deposits are swapped into DAI via Curve Finance's 3pool while USDC deposits are converted to DAI via MakerDAO.\n\nThese user deposits are then converted into yield bearing assets. Blast natively participates in ETH staking and will stake the deposited ETH on Lido, where it's converted to stETH and staking yields about 4% APY.\n\nETH deposited and staked with Blast is auto rebasing, meaning it's meant to maintain a stable price and protect holders from potential inflation.\n\nStablecoins are deposited into on-chain treasury bill protocols like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate contract. These claim to yield about 5% APY and will be returned to Blast users via USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin.\n\nSince Blast is in early access for the next couple of months, participation is limited to invite codes. Users get more Blast points based on how much they bridge and who they invite.\n\nWhy's Blast so popular? The pull factor of Blast's yield and star power\n\nA minimum of 4% yield on ETH and stablecoin deposits\n\nWith the current state of staking on L2s, some crypto natives may feel that the possible yield gained doesn't justify locking up one's digital assets on-chain for staking. As the newest Ethereum L2 on the block, Blast is seeking to offer more lucrative staking for ETH and stablecoin holders than its competitors. Since the baseline interest rate on existing L2s is 0%, assets on L2s are basically depreciating over time thanks to inflation. Armed with native yield, Blast offers a compelling alternative solution by providing at least 4% APY and more in Blast rewards.\n\nBlur-related FOMO\n\nAnother reason Blast has racked up so much TVL in such a short amount of time is perhaps due to the fear of missing out. As Blast is headed by Blur's founder, crypto natives are undoubtedly going to jump on Blast because of how successful Blur became in taking on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Speaking of reputable names, top venture capitalist firms like Paradigm and Standard Crypto have also joined the fray by raising $20 million for Blast. This has undoubtedly created a dilemma where users are tempted to deposit on Blast with the justification that big money is also doing it.\n\nHonesty in how Blast will operate\n\nFinally, Blast has been the talk of the town in the staking space because it has seemingly laid all its cards on the table when it comes to overall transparency. From clearly stating where the deposits will be staked to listing out when the Blast mainnet goes live and when rewards will be distributed, Blast's refreshing honesty is a contrast to what we sometimes see in shady DeFi projects that try to fool users through the door with high and unsustainable yields while minimizing overall communication.\n\nWhat are the risks of depositing on Blast?\n\nWhile some may welcome what Blast offers since staking on L2 typically provides 0% yield, some eagle-eyed commentators are saying otherwise by pointing out some red flags.\n\nThe safety of user deposits\n\nRight from the getgo, Blast displays some signs of security weakness. Its smart contracts are owned by a 3-of-5 Safe multisig wallet and the active signers of said wallet are funded by an account with ties to degenerate NFT trading activity. According to a thread posted by user harls.eth, the funds are linked to a wallet littered with questionable NFT buys. While some Blast users may brush this off, such ties don't exactly paint Blast in the best light. With the amount of cyberhacks happening in late 2023, all it takes is a smart contract bug to trigger a massive withdrawal of millions of deposits and cause heartbreak for thousands of users.\n\nThe Blast rewards framework\n\nA big reason crypto natives are going all out to secure a Blast invite is because of the additional yield gained by depositing their ETH and stablecoins. By promising yields above what typical risk-free rates offer, this definitely checks the boxes of yield hunters looking to maximize their DeFi gains.\n\nDigging deeper into Blast's current reward framework reveals other red flags worth mentioning. In its current early access state, deposits into Blast are one-way with no way of withdrawing until Blast's mainnet goes live. Additionally, Blast is promising rewards as a bonus for users who participate early. While it does sound lucrative, these rewards are points for an L2 solution that's yet to be released. This echoes the critique by Cinneamhain Ventures' Adam Cochran, who claims Blast is a platform with one-way deposits.\n\nLeaderboard and Spins system resembling a pyramid marketing scheme\n\nAdditionally, Blast has a Leaderboard and Spins mechanic that should inspire caution. Essentially, it's a recruitment system that encourages existing users to 'recruit' more users to sign up in hopes of forming a Squad of Blast users. By convincing invitees to deposit, users earn bonus luck, which contributes to their overall odds of gaining more Blast points when they play the Spins minigame. Each week, users will get a fixed amount of Spins, which is a card-flipping minigame that grants you extra points based on your luck.\n\nTo summarize these mechanics, the more ETH one's overall Squad is worth, the more invites one gets. With more deposits, users can increase their luck when interacting with Super Spins and reap more Blast points. This structure of getting more interested individuals to pile on later in order for the earliest Blast users to benefit has been criticized as a form of Ponzi scheme by some in the crypto community. At a minimum, traders should note that it might be tough for Blast to maintain its current TVL levels without rewarding users to keep them around.\n\nThe future of Blast L2: what can users look forward to?\n\nAlthough there isn't an official roadmap yet for the future of Blast besides dates relating to its mainnet launch and reward distribution, Roquerre's recent thread has declared that Blast is meant to complement the Blur ecosystem. It also aims to help its users avoid asset depreciation, reduce NFT transaction costs, and launch NFT perps. Blast's future ambitions would allow it to be beneficial to all DApps since an L2 with native yield opportunities like Blast will unlock possibilities for the entire on-chain economy. Roquerre then extends the benefits to Perps, DEXes, lending, NFTs, and SocialFi as potential benefactors.\n\nShould you deposit on Blast?\n\nAs every individual has their own levels of risk tolerance and trading plans to stick to, there's no hard-and-fast rule that you should or shouldn't consider depositing ETH and stablecoins on Blast. Ultimately, one should weigh both benefits and risks before coming to a personal decision.\n\nFor those won over by Roquerre and his ambitions, Blast succeeding as an L2 solution definitely doesn't seem to be far fetched as he might be able to replicate Blur's success with Blast. Those who do so could be rewarded with bonus Blast point yields and the ability to say they were one of the early access depositers.\n\nOn the flipside, Blast certainly does display its fair share of risks. From its aggressive recruitment structure to the sustainability of its future rewards, many doubters are claiming that Blast is getting ahead of itself by delivering a marketing narrative without launching an actual L2 product.\n\nFinal words and next steps\n\nCan Blast keep its explosive momentum going? That seems to be a question many crypto natives and critics are asking as Blast's TVL numbers beat the odds and increase by the millions each day. As hype and anticipation builds behind the L2's impending launch, it'll certainly be interesting to see how Blast plays out.\n\nOverall, the synergy between Blur and Blast will definitely be interesting as Blur has stated that it plans to test and deploy its L2 apps on Blast. Whether this'll result in a thriving ecosystem that takes the crypto world by storm is another story. As an Ethereum L2 optimistic rollup solution that offers native yield, Blast has hit the ground running in gaining adoption among diehard Blur fans and yield hunting crypto natives. Ultimately, only time will tell if they're able to stick the landing and establish themselves as one of the leaders in the L2 space.\n\nKeen to see how Blast's success impacts Blur prices?

Since Nov. 21, 2022, they have amassed 30.3% additional coins and now control 52% of Ethereum's circulating supply.\n\nFurthermore, 94,700 new ETH wallets were created on Nov. 21, the largest number since July.\n\nETH was down 1.22% in the last 24 hours to $2,076 at the time of writing. On Nov. 24, bulls drove the price of Ethereum to a high of $2,134 before falling. If this level is breached, ETH might begin a northward march toward $2,200, perhaps opening the door for a rise to $3,400.\n\nThis optimistic outlook will be rendered meaningless in the near term if the price falls below the critical support level of $1,900.\n\nEthereum Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum developer Tim Beiko shared a brief recap of the ACDE call held earlier this week.

        "title": "Bitcoin's (BTC) Potential Surge to $220K by Next Halving; New AI Crypto Could Mirror Ethereum's (ETH) Success - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) block subsidy halving is an event investors eagerly anticipate, occurring roughly every four years (210,000 blocks). Many analysts predict that following the halving, the price of BTC could surge to $220,000 because Bitcoin\u2019s supply would have been reduced by half. Meanwhile, InQubeta (QUBE), a cryptocurrency focused on artificial intelligence, appears to follow Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) successful model.\n\nFor a few months now, InQubeta has been growing traction and value among investors, cementing its standing as the best crypto investment for profitable returns. Since the QUBE presale has been remarkably successful in its early stages, analysts now predict that QUBE could mirror Ethereum\u2019s success. Let\u2019s explore InQubeta\u2019s potential to match Ethereum\u2019s success and the expectations of Bitcoin\u2019s price to surge on its next halving.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s (QUBE) Outstanding Performance Points at AI Crypto Dominance\n\nThe QUBE token has increased steadily since InQubeta launched its presale. The tokens\u2019 value has increased throughout its first five stages, from $0.007 to $0.0161, demonstrating why InQubeta is the best crypto investment for substantial gains. The project\u2019s early success in securing investor confidence indicates that it could perform as well as Ethereum in the crypto market. Growing presale investors have made it possible for the project to sell more than 527 million tokens so far, amassing over $5.2 million, putting it on track to become the best DeFi crypto.\n\nInQubeta aims to make investments in artificial intelligence (AI) more accessible and democratic. The idea is to enable fractional investment through QUBE in AI startups using smart contracts and the blockchain. Investors can help AI startups develop and succeed by using this tactic, regardless of their financial status.\n\nPopular NFTs (non-fungible tokens) can also be minted by AI startups and sold on the NFT marketplace to QUBE holders. The NFT marketplace opens doors for investors and enables entrepreneurs to list their popular NFTs in front of a large audience. Given that these NFTs are fractionalized, they are inexpensive, and investors will make money off of them as these startups grow.\n\nQUBE is a deflationary token that can hold its value over time. Token holders, at the same time, have a voice in the decisions and development of the platform. There is also a 12-week vesting period for QUBE. Through vesting, InQubeta releases tokens progressively, potentially fostering confidence as the best DeFi crypto and boosting QUBE prices.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Speculated to Reach $220,000 by the Next Halving Secures Investors\u2019 Optimism\n\nBitcoin halving is a quadrennial event whereby the amount of Bitcoin given to miners is cut in half to fuel the coin\u2019s scarcity. This halving causes the value of BTC to rise over time, making it one of the most sought-after cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Archive predicts that in 18 months, Bitcoin will likely trade at $220,000. Its prediction is based on the fact that, twelve months after the last halving, BTC\u2019s price surged six times its trading value.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Empowers Innovation Through its Proof-of-Stake Mechanism\n\nAbout a year has passed since Ethereum completed the \u201cMerge,\u201d which changed the blockchain\u2019s consensus process from one based on proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Users could earn a passive revenue stream, and the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency was significantly increased by staking their ETH to secure the network. This has been viewed as a positive development for the ETH network overall. Many users have already staked twenty percent of all circulating Ether.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs the crypto market anticipates Bitcoin\u2019s potential surge to $220,000 by the next halving, InQubeta has emerged as a contender that could mirror the success of Ethereum. InQubeta is a high-growth investment opportunity that has the potential to perform as promised, if not better, considering the remarkable performance of the presale. It is still cheap and it could yield massive returns when it launches. Following QUBE\u2019s exchange listing and the start of InQubeta\u2019s widespread adoption, a buying frenzy might push the cryptocurrency\u2019s value to all-time highs.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

        "title": "Altcoins with 100x Potential: BUY These Before the Next Bull - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market begins to show signs of a new bull run, investors should look for opportunities to position themselves advantageously. This current positivity in the crypto market signals a pivotal moment for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth. Here are 5 altcoins to consider for the long term. While some altcoins with 100x potential might be risky, the below presents more established projects.\n\nWhat Are Altcoins?\n\nAltcoins, short for \u201calternative coins,\u201d refer to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They have emerged as a significant sector within the cryptocurrency market, offering diverse functionalities ranging from smart contracts and decentralized applications (like Ethereum) to the more recent meme-inspired coins such as Dogecoin and ApeMax. Altcoins are not just about creating digital currencies; they often aim to address perceived limitations of Bitcoin or explore new possibilities with blockchain technology.\n\nAre Altcoins Good to Buy?\n\nInvesting in altcoins can be a strategic addition to any investment portfolio. The reason is their potential for high returns. While they carry higher risks compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the potential rewards can be substantial. Some altcoins have been known to yield returns exceeding 100x, especially if invested in at the right time. This high-reward potential makes them an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nCan Altcoins Really Deliver 100x Returns?\n\nThe possibility of achieving over 100x returns with altcoins is a topic of much interest among investors. While such high returns are not guaranteed and come with significant risk, the timing of the investment plays a crucial role. Investing in altcoins during their early stages or before a predicted bull run in the crypto market can potentially lead to substantial gains. However, it\u2019s important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved.\n\nWhere to Buy Altcoins \u2013 Good Crypto Exchange\n\nFor those interested in purchasing altcoins, various platforms offer access to these cryptocurrencies. Bitget stands out as a reliable option. It provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced traders to navigate and make transactions.
