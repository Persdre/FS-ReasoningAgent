        "title": "Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Are Slumping Today. Here's Why. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A spot Bitcoin ETF was all but a sure thing -- has that changed?\n\nWell, that rally to end 2023 and into early 2024 had to end at some point.\n\nMany of the top cryptocurrencies in the market are reeling today, as risk assets across the board decline on a variety of headwinds. Ethereum (ETH 0.27%), Solana (SOL -1.54%), and XRP (XRP 1.99%) are among the tokens to watch for crypto investors, having declined 6.7%, 9.2%, and 8.4%, respectively, over the past 24 hours at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nA number of macro forces are driving most long-duration assets lower today. A strengthening U.S. dollar, a decline in long bonds (and corresponding surge in yields), and a widespread rotation to more defensive assets has plagued more speculative asset classes such as crypto over the past 24 to 48 hours.\n\nAdditionally, these three tokens have their own set of headwinds investors appear to be pricing in today. Let's dive into what's driving this move in these three top-10 digital assets right now.\n\nI thought this was a crypto bull market -- what gives?\n\nA good portion of the recent rise in crypto assets over the past few months can be attributed to expectations about a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. Expected by Jan. 10, such an ETF could pave the way for similar products for Ethereum (given there are proposals already underway) and potentially other major tokens such as Solana and XRP to follow.\n\nAccordingly, a narrative shift among many in the crypto market over the past day or so is wreaking havoc on investors relying on this catalyst. Some analysts and experts, such as Matrixport's Markus Thielen, believe that an ultimate approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF may still be a \"long shot.\"\n\nThis view appears to be spreading, with an increase in bearish bets on top cryptocurrencies driving some of the accelerated downside move today. Additionally, nearly $100 million in bullish perpetual contracts placed on Ethereum have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, as per Coinglass. XRP and Solana are also among the top five crypto tokens in terms of long liquidations today, suggesting leveraged upside bets on these tokens are turning sour.\n\nFundamentals weakening\n\nIn addition to the leveraged derivatives market, another key fundamental factor many investors consider when gauging the health of the crypto market over a specific time frame is total value locked (TVL). TVL generally reflects the amount of capital existing within specific crypto ecosystems. When times are good, capital flows into the crypto sector, and this number rises.\n\nUnfortunately, since the beginning of the year, the total TVL for all crypto projects has dropped 5.8% to $52.49 billion. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP saw similar declines in their TVL values, though these three projects have still seen their cumulative TVL numbers rally nicely off of last year's lows.\n\nWhile many still expect that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in short order (partly due to various meetings between Wall Street companies and the SEC in recent days), investors and users appear to be taking a cautious approach with their capital right now.\n\nBottom line\n\nOverall, the crypto sector, and many of its top tokens, appear to be feeling the effects of uncertainty today. At the end of the day, investing is about assessing probabilities. And up until a couple of days ago, the market seemed to be pretty certain that spot ETFs are coming in short order, leading to risk-on trades across this sector in projects that may follow Bitcoin's lead.\n\nThe expected decision date is now about a week away. Until then, I expect more volatility on the horizon, as additional leaks filter into the overall narrative for this sector."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt\u2019s a new year, but airdrop season is continuing at full force into 2024. The latest: Dymension, a network for deploying app chains called \u201cRollApps,\u201d has revealed a token drop for more than a million crypto users across various chains and projects.\n\nDymension is a layer-1 blockchain built on Cosmos and the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) to enable connections across various rollup scaling networks. \u201cDymension standardizes rollups with IBC, similar to how tokens were standardized with ERC,\u201d Dymension wrote on Twitter (aka X), referring to Ethereum\u2019s token standards.\n\nThe network lets RollApp creators choose which virtual machine and token to use, and can publish data to external chains like Celestia or Avail. Dymension CEO and co-founder Yishay Harel told Decrypt that the L1 network uses Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) addresses.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dymension revealed its \u201cgenesis rolldrop,\u201d which offers up DYM tokens to eligible users until January 21. United States residents cannot participate in the airdrop. However, a wide array of other crypto users are eligible for the airdrop, with some 70 million DYM tokens (7% of the supply) being offered up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStarting today, over one million addresses have the opportunity to participate in Dymension\u2019s Genesis Rolldrop! Eligible participants can claim up to 70M DYM (7% of total supply), the native asset of Dymension, until 21 January 2024, 12:00 UTC \u2014 Dymension (@dymension) January 2, 2024\n\nFull details are available in this blog post, but eligible users include those who staked the TIA token in Celestia as of December 19, 2023, along with users of Ethereum layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and the upcoming Blast based on certain criteria.\n\nCosmos Hub and Stride users who meet certain eligibility can also claim DYM tokens, along with users of the Osmosis decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nMore than 500,000 Solana users are also eligible, according to the post, including addresses that have used protocols like cross-chain bridge Wormhole, leading NFT marketplace Tensor, and NFT distribution platform Drip.Haus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdditionally, owners of Pudgy Penguins, Mad Lads, Tensorians, and Bad Kids NFTs can also claim an allotment of DYM tokens. Pudgy Penguins is minted on Ethereum, Mad Lads and Tensorians are on Solana, and Bad Kids is on the Cosmos-based Stargaze chain.\n\nLastly, following the genesis airdrop, Dymension has proposed allocating a further 2.5 million DYM to users who bridge funds to the chain from other networks. Eligible tokens include USDC, TIA, USDT, ATOM, ETH, and SOL, with that program expected to begin about a week following the upcoming Dymension airdrop launch.\n\nDymension joins a growing list of networks and projects that are dropping their tokens lately, including recent high-profile airdrops from Jito and Pyth Network and upcoming drops from the likes of Jupiter, Starknet, Portal, Frame, and Blast.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Goldstation, the first-ever gold DeFi platform on a public mainnet outside of Ethereum , combines Klaytn's low fees and latency to offer more efficient gold investments through $GPC, a gold-pegged token 1:1 backed by physical gold.\n\nSouth Korean residents will be able to convert their physical gold holdings into NFTs via The Mining Club, then using the NFT as collateral to mint $GPC. A global launch for Goldstation is planned.\n\nKlaytn Foundation and CREDER intend to expand beyond gold to tokenize more precious metals for the domestic and global markets.\n\nSINGAPORE, Jan. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Klaytn Foundation, established to build and decentralize the ecosystem of South Korea's leading Layer 1 blockchain Klaytn, announced today that Klaytn Governance Council (GC) member CREDER has launched $GPC (Gold-Pegged Coin), a digital asset pegged to the real-time market price of gold; and Goldstation, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for $GPC, on Klaytn.\n\nKlaytn Onboards Goldstation and $GPC, Launching the First Gold RWA DeFi Platform Outside of Ethereum\n\n$GPC marks two firsts in the RWA tokenization industry \u2014 it is the first tokenized gold to be available on DeFi outside of the Ethereum ecosystem, and also the first gold-pegged token that does not charge a percentage-based commission for transactions. These two attributes allow $GPC to truly deliver on the benefits of real-world asset tokenization, with Klaytn's low gas fees allowing individuals with small investment capital to add gold to their portfolios without gas fees eating a significant portion of their investment, and the lack of percentage-based fees ensuring that trading gold on-chain remains cost-effective regardless of the amount one wishes to transact.\n\nGoldstation also marks the first-ever gold real-world asset (RWA) token DeFi platform powered by a public mainnet other than Ethereum. It will commence its services, which includes $GPC staking and more, on 24 January 2024. Goldstation will transform gold investments from conventionally relying only on market profits, into DeFi interest revenue generation opportunities. In addition, Goldstation will serve as a hyper-efficient and more profitable gold investment destination, thanks to Klaytn's low transaction fees, high TPS capabilities, and support for the ERC-3643 tokenization standard.\n\nTo mint $GPC, users will need to first convert their gold assets into NFTs via The Mining Club, which is a platform operated by CREDER that proves users' unique digital ownership of real gold assets using blockchain technology. Once a user's gold assets are recorded as an NFT, they will be able to issue $GPC at Goldstation by placing their gold NFT as collateral. This entire physical gold to $GPC tokenization process can be easily carried out with a few clicks by connecting their crypto wallets that support Klaytn, such as Kaikas, Metamask, and Kakao KLIP.\n\nGoldstation is currently only available for South Korean residents, with plans for a global launch in the future.\n\nLeading up to the launch, Klaytn Foundation worked closely with CREDER, sharing its business network of leading domestic and foreign partners while cooperating for regulatory compliance, platform optimization, and domestic and global marketing. In addition, as Klaytn recently integrated support for the ERC-3643 tokenization standard, Klaytn Foundation and CREDER plan to comprehensively expand precious metals RWA tokenization beyond gold in the future.\n\n\"Gold NFTs and $GPC can be ledgered on-chain for anyone through Oracle Network's Proof of Reserve (POR),\" said James Lim, CEO of CREDER, \"we will create a new standard for RWA with Klaytn based on the power of transparency and trust that Web 3.0 finance will deliver.\"\n\n\"We are very pleased that Klaytn is the mainnet of choice for CREDER's Goldstation, the first gold RWA token DeFi platform outside of the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Sam Seo, Representative Director of Klaytn Foundation. \"Klaytn Foundation has been working together with CREDER's meticulous preparation for $GPC and Goldstation. Moving forward, we will closely cooperate with them to deliver more diverse metal RWA tokenization projects for the domestic and global markets.\"\n\nAbout CREDER, Blockchain Financial Platform\n\nFounded in 2022, CREDER (CEO James Im) is a digital transformation (DX) company that is conducting Korea's first 100% real gold-based RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization business. It has developed a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that can utilize the issuance of gold NFTs and tokens linked to real gold. CREDER is currently the governance council (hereinafter referred to as GC) of Korea's leading global Layer 1 blockchain platform, Klaytn. More information about CREDER can be found at https://www.creder.biz.\n\nAbout Klaytn Foundation\n\nKlaytn Foundation was established in 2020 to expand the ecosystem of Klaytn, a global Layer 1 blockchain platform, and has since been actively collaborating with its Governance Council members worldwide. Klaytn Foundation facilitates the adoption and development of new technologies to ensure that Klaytn fulfills its role as an open, trusted, and sustainable blockchain platform for developers and users alike. It also facilitates decision-making to ensure that the ecosystem continues to expand optimally in the rapidly changing blockchain landscape. In line with its long-term Governance Roadmap, Klaytn Foundation plans to fully implement the Decentralization Phase of the Klaytn blockchain in 2023 and beyond.\n\nSOURCE Klaytn Foundation"

        "content": "An Ethereum (ETH)-based altcoin is exploding in value after ETH founder Vitalik Buterin said the project is vital to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nButerin tells his five million followers on the social media platform X that all layer-2 (L2) projects should integrate with Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a platform that lets users buy a \u201cdomain name\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain rather than using default addresses.\n\nThe domain names on ENS can be used to transfer and receive funds instead of using alphanumeric wallet addresses.\n\nSays Buterin,\n\n\u201cAll L2s should be working on (trustless, merkle-proof-based) CCIP resolvers, so that we can have ENS subdomains registerable, updateable and readable directly on L2s. ENS is super-important, it needs to be affordable!\u201d\n\nAccording to data from blockchain data platform Dune Analytics, there are about 2.14 million active ENS names and more than 801,000 unique participants.\n\nLayer-2s, such as Optimism (OP) or Arbitrum (ARB), are built on top of Ethereum to improve scalability and costs.\n\nCCIP, or cross-chain interoperability protocol, is a protocol that allows for the resolution of information on or off-chain from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ENS was trading at a low of $8.88. After Buterin\u2019s social media post, ENS soared to $14.20, a nearly 60% gain.

        "content": "Solana NFT Sales Overtake Ethereum for the First Time Ever in December\n\nSolana's NFT sales volume surpassed that of Ethereum in December 2023, marking the first time this has occurred. According to data from CryptoSlam, Solana's NFT sales reached approximately $366.5 million, while Ethereum's sales totaled $353.2 million.\n\nWhen excluding wash trades, Solana's sales remained strong at $366.5 million, nearly matching its all-time high of $373.5 million set in October 2021. In contrast, Ethereum's sales were relatively flat, with December's total being comparable to November's $350 million.\n\nFurthermore, Solana saw an increased number of unique traders, with around 218,000 unique sellers and 279,000 buyers. That is nearly double the number of unique traders compared to Ethereum.\n\nThe surge in Solana's NFT sales may be attributed to the significant rise in the value of its native token, SOL, which has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. This has also led to the resurgence of the Solana ecosystem, coupled with a memecoin frenzy led by Bonk (BONK).\n\nThe influx of users and transactions on Solana may be driven by broader momentum around the network and the hype surrounding specific projects offering potential airdrops and other perks. Projects like Tensorians and Mad Lads generated substantial trading volume in December, contributing to Solana's overall success.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Arbitrum One\u2019s Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a remarkable increase of 15.9%, reaching a milestone of $10.22 billion in the past seven days, making it the first Layer 2 (L2) network to surpass the $10 billion TVL mark.\n\nThe achievement follows an incident on December 15, where Arbitrum One faced a two-hour partial outage due to a surge of Bitcoin Ordinals-inspired inscriptions that led to the triggering of a sequencer stop.\n\nArbitrum One Dominates Ethereum Layer 2 TVL\n\nAccording to data by L2Beat, the total TVL for Ethereum Layer 2 networks has reached $20.82 billion, with Arbitrum One contributing significantly by accounting for 48.03% of the total.\n\nArbitrum currently holds a diversified asset portfolio with 30.9% in Ethereum (ETH), 23.68% in its native governance token ARB, 29.66% allocated to stablecoins, and the remaining 15.76% spread across various other assets. Notably, the ARB token has registered a 14.3% increase in value over the past 24 hours, according to Coingecko data.\n\nThe success of Arbitrum One can be attributed to its ability to replicate the Ethereum experience while offering substantially lower transaction costs. This cost-effectiveness has attracted a considerable number of decentralized applications (dApps), with approximately 470 currently deployed on the network.\n\nThe implementation of the ARB token, serving as a governance token, has significantly contributed to the platform\u2019s growth. Governance tokens empower holders to actively participate in decision-making processes concerning the platform\u2019s development and policies, thereby incentivizing greater user engagement within the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the Arbitrum One network boasts a well-established Security Council, a deployed and operational proof system, and accepts fraud proofs from a minimum of five external actors. Moreover, the platform offers a 7-day exit window without relying on a permissioned operator in the event of an unpopular upgrade by actors with more centralization than a security council.\n\nArbitrum One on Upward Trajectory After Outage\n\nArbitrum One faced downtime on December 15, which was categorized as a \u201cmajor outage\u201d on the dashboard. An investigation was initiated to identify the root cause and implement a fix.\n\nBefore the interruption, Arbitrum\u2019s layer-2 network had processed over 22.29 million transactions, as reported by l2beat, and boasted a total value locked of $2.3 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nThe incident on December 15 was not the first time Arbitrum faced disruptions. In June 2023, the DeFi Layer 2 network experienced a standstill for over an hour due to a bug in its sequencer. The bug caused the sequencer to revert batches on-chain, leading to the depletion of Ether (ETH) from the sequencer. Developers intervened by manually replenishing the sequencer, addressing the bug, and restoring normalcy to the Layer 2 network."

Furthermore, Bitcoin was not the only cryptocurrency affected.\n\nSolana [SOL] fell by 7% within the hour while XRP plunged by 12%. Ethereum [ETH] also joined in with a 5.30% plunge.\n\nBitcoin ETFs to be delayed?\n\nAt press time, AMBCrypto found that right before the dump Matrixport reported the U.S. SEC would not approve any Bitcoin ETFs this month.\n\nThe news sent panic waves around the market. Also, Economist and trader Alex Kruger noted earlier that a crash was coming.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume surged as a result. At press time, BTC volume surpassed $40 billion. This was proof of high selling pressure. Liquidations have also affected traders, especially longs.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, the Liquidation HeatMap showed that over $500 million had been wiped out. Bitcoin took a large part of the hit with $72.13 million.\n\nDetails from the HeatMap also showed that longs were the most affected."

        "content": "Etherscan claims that the broader goal of the acquisition is to \"make on-chain data easy to access, driving mainstream blockchain adoption.\"\n\nShare this article\n\nEtherscan, a prominent blockchain data provider, has acquired Solscan, a leading explorer for Solana, to expand its data services by integrating the two platforms. Etherscan announced details of the acquisition on X, saying that it hopes to continue providing \u201ccredibly neutral and equitable access to blockchain data.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udce2 We're excited to share that Solscan has now joined Etherscan! With the addition of @solscanofficial to the team, we hope to continue executing on our vision of providing credibly neutral and equitable access to blockchain data. pic.twitter.com/N8TcxQHFLi \u2014 Etherscan (@etherscan) January 3, 2024\n\nAccording to Etherscan, the integration aims to improve access and experience for the over 3 million monthly Solscan users by leveraging synergies in features and capabilities between the Ethereum and Solana explorers.\n\nEtherscan explores Ethereum data including wallet transactions and token details, offering insights into individual wallets and tokens. Solscan is a blockchain explorer specifically for Solana, featuring comprehensive analytics and user-friendly access to transactions, addresses, contracts, blocks, and tokens. Though these features are not mutually exclusive and can be found in both, Solscan has a simpler interface and provides more intuitive visualizations.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that through this acquisition, Solscan will likely be included in Etherscan\u2019s suite of products for its Explorer-as-a-Service (EaaS) offering, which includes explorers for major chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Linea, Scroll, and Base, among others.\n\n\u201cThe Solscan team has proven their expertise over the years by offering detailed insights and analytics. Their expertise in making blockchain data accessible and user-friendly also aligns perfectly with our mission at Etherscan,\u201d shares Matthew Tan, CEO and founder of Etherscan.\n\nEtherscan claims that the broader goal of the acquisition is to \u201cmake on-chain data easy to access, driving mainstream blockchain adoption.\u201d\n\nBlockchain explorers serve a vital purpose \u2014 they allow anyone to easily monitor activity on public ledgers. Services like Etherscan and Solscan help decode dense on-chain data into readable insight, helping contextualize information on transactions, tokens, NFTs, addresses, and more.\n\nThe acquisition can be seen as a response to demand for on-chain data as Solana\u2018s native cryptocurrency, SOL, experienced a sharp surge in 2023. Etherscan has not provided public information on the acquisition\u2019s price and terms.\n\nData from CoinGecko indicates that SOL ranks as the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap ($47 billion), with its spot price trading at $110, down 3.4% in the past 24-hour cycle. Using the same indicators and cycle, Ethereum\u2019s ether (ETH) has a market cap of $283.8 billion, with the token trading at $2,360, down by -1.1%."

        "title": "ERC-20 Token Standard Explained - LCX",
        "content": "What Is the ERC-20 Standard?\n\nERC-20 is a technical standard used on the Ethereum Blockchain for smart contracts. It is an acronym for \u201cEthereum Request for Comment 20\u201d and was proposed in 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller. Developers can establish their own tokens on this blockchain by adhering to the ERC-20 standard. This standard facilitates the creation and deployment of tokens by providing a common set of interfaces and functions that can be used by various token contracts. This implies that ERC-20 tokens are interoperable and can be traded on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nThe Ethereum Blockchain is a decentralized platform that enables developers to construct and deploy decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and digital tokens. Developers must adhere to the ERC-20 standard in order to establish their own digital tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. These tokens represent numerous assets, including utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins. ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning that they can be exchanged for other tokens of the same type and value. For instance, a single ERC-20 token for a specific project has the same value as any other token of that project. This is due to the fact that all ERC-20 tokens share the same properties, such as a name, symbol, and decimals, as well as functions, such as transferring tokens between addresses and verifying an address\u2019s balance.\n\nERC-20 tokens can represent any type of asset, including utility tokens, security tokens, and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC). They can be used for fundraising for a new project, creating a loyalty programme for a business, or granting access to a specific service or product.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard specifies six required and three optional functions that developers must include in their smart contract code in order to generate an ERC-20 token. These functions include:\n\nTotalSupply: This function returns the entire number of tokens that have been generated for a specific project.\n\nBalanceOf: This function returns the token balance held by a specified address.\n\nTransfer: This function enables an address to transmit tokens to another address.\n\nApprove: With this function, an address can authorize another address to spend tokens on its behalf.\n\nTransferFrom: This function enables an address to receive tokens from another address that has granted permission for the transfer.\n\nAllowance: This function returns the number of tokens an authorized address is permitted to spend on behalf of another address.\n\nThe three optional functions that developers can add to the contract code for ERC-20 tokens are:\n\nName: The function returns the token\u2019s name.\n\nSymbol: This function returns the token\u2019s emblem (typically a few letters or characters representing the token).\n\nDecimals: This function returns the number of decimal digits that the token can be divided into.\n\nIn addition to the six required and three optional functions, developers can add additional functions and features to ERC-20 token contracts. Time-based restrictions on token transfers or special incentive structures for early adopters are examples of additional features.\n\nNotably, while ERC-20 has become the most prominent standard for creating tokens on Ethereum, there are other token standards, such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155. Each of these standards has its own distinct characteristics and use cases, but ERC-20 remains the most popular and widely adopted standard.\n\nNotably, ERC-20 tokens require the Ethereum network in order to function. When you send an ERC-20 token from one address to another, you will be required to pay a small quantity of ETH (in the form of gas fees) to cover the cost of processing the transaction on the network.\n\nHow Does ERC20 Work?\n\nERC20 is a standard protocol, not a piece of software or a program. The ERC20 protocol governs the creation of new tokens, ensuring that they conform to the necessary technical requirements. If a token does not adhere to the technical specifications specified by ERC20, it will not meet the definition of an ERC20 token and will not be issued on the network.\n\nIt may be useful to compare ERC20 to HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used by websites. HTTP specifies how internet messages are formatted and transmitted, as well as how servers and web browsers should respond to various commands.\n\nSimilarly, ERC20 specifies the essential characteristics and functionality of tokens based on Ethereum. Uncompliant tokens cannot be issued, transferred, or listed on exchanges.\n\nThe ERC20 Standard\n\nTo utilise ERC20 tokens, smart contracts must adhere to the applicable ERC standards. Currently, there are nine laws, and six of them are mandatory. The remaining three are optional. These consist of:\n\nMandatory Rules Optional Rules Allowance Token Name Approve Decimal (MAX:18) TransferFrom Symbol Transfer BalanceOf TotalSupply\n\nThese principles must be incorporated into a token\u2019s code for it to qualify as ERC20. Without explicit instructions for these rules or standards, the token would not be able to interact with smart contracts effectively, which could result in a variety of problems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard has played a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain technology and the Ethereum ecosystem. Its simplicity, interoperability, and flexibility have enabled the creation of diverse tokens that power a wide array of decentralized applications. As the blockchain space continues to grow and evolve, the ERC-20 standard will remain a fundamental building block, and its influence will extend beyond this network into other blockchain networks. Understanding ERC-20 tokens is crucial for anyone interested in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, as they continue to shape the future of finance, gaming, and digital asset ownership."

        "title": "Solana NFT Sales Skyrocket, Topping Ethereum in Monthly Volume for First Time - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana\u2019s surging fortunes of late have produced a surprising result in the NFT market: monthly sales volume of NFTs on the network beat that of NFTs on Ethereum in December 2023, for the first time ever.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform CryptoSlam, Solana NFT sales tallied about $366.5 million worth in December compared to $353.2 million on Ethereum. CryptoSlam\u2019s \u201corganic\u201d sales figures exclude suspicious trades marked as \u201cwash trading,\u201d with about $381 million worth of Ethereum sales excluded and just $10.1 million worth of Solana sales pulled out.\n\nSolana\u2019s total of $366.5 million in trades nearly matched the network\u2019s all-time high, according to CryptoSlam, which was about $373.5 million worth in October 2021 as the space was just heating up. We\u2019ve seen daily Solana NFT sales volume pop above Ethereum at times, but never in terms of a full month\u2019s worth of trades.\n\nSolana saw about double the amount of unique buyers and sellers in December too, and far more total NFT transactions. CryptoSlam reports about 218,000 sellers and 279,000 buyers on Solana across nearly 6.6 million NFT transactions. Compare that to about 114,000 sellers and over 143,000 buyers on Ethereum, across 698,000 transactions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT sales volume in December was pretty much flat compared to November\u2019s total of almost $350 million worth, while Solana saw a surge from about $83 million worth then.\n\nOf course, Solana has seen its price rise dramatically of late. SOL is up over 71% in the past month, and has more than quadrupled in price over the past three months. Ethereum, by contrast, is up 9% in the last 30 days and about 44% since three months ago.\n\nSolana\u2019s price jump may be part of the reason why the value of its NFT sales spiked in December, but it doesn\u2019t account for the roughly tripled number of unique traders and sixfold increase on monthly NFT transactions. Also, the average NFT sale on Solana actually fell from about $74 in November to under $56 in December.\n\nThe surge in users and transactions may be due to broader momentum around Solana and hype around particular projects tied to potential access to airdrops and other perks. Tensorians, for example, the NFT project tied to leading Solana marketplace Tensor, saw $28 million worth of trades in December, while Mad Lads generated $24.5 million in trades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam, the top Ethereum NFT project in December was the Bored Ape Yacht Club with $19.5 million worth of NFT trades, with Pudgy Penguins following behind with about $18.3 million worth of trades.\n\nAt a glance, CryptoSlam\u2019s data suggests that Bitcoin Ordinals trades\u2014that is, the protocol that enables NFT-like media to be put on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014generated more trading volume than Ethereum and Solana combined in December, with $881.2 million worth across over 493,000 transactions.\n\nHowever, CryptoSlam tracks Bitcoin Ordinals differently than it does NFTs on other networks. The data includes trading of BRC-20 tokens, which are minted via the Ordinals protocol but function like fungible, interchangeable tokens on other chains. CryptoSlam does not track the trading of Ethereum ERC-20 tokens or Solana SPL tokens, which are effectively similar to BRC-20 tokens.\n\nUncategorized Ordinals\u2014that is, various media assets that aren\u2019t part of a defined project\u2014made up about $88.5 million worth of trades in December, with the top individual Ordinals project being Bitcoin Frogs at $27.7 million.\n\nThe next-highest ranking individual Ordinals project that isn\u2019t a BRC-20 token? Bitcoin Punks, a CryptoPunks knockoff, with less than $3.3 million worth of trades in December. Fungible token trades make up an enormous portion of Ordinals trading tracked on the platform, making it difficult to take the Bitcoin figures at face value."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has released a roadmap detailing the network\u2019s upgrades and activities for 2024.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Buterin stated that the 2024 roadmap contained few changes from the 2023 plan and that the network is set to focus on the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Roadmap For 2024\n\nSince the Merge took place in September 2022, the Ethereum network will now prioritize implementing the role of a single slot finality (SSF). While the Merge saw Ethereum transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to that of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), SSF will resolve the network\u2019s current weaknesses.\n\nThe concept of SSF can make Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism validate blocks more efficiently; the blocks could be proposed and finalized in the same slot, significantly reducing time-to-finality by 15 minutes. Buterin believes this is the easiest path to fixing Ethereum\u2019s PoS issues.\n\nThen comes the Surge with a goal of 100,000 transactions per second on rollups. The Ethereum co-founder revealed that cross-rollup standards and interop have been highlighted as areas for long-term improvements, and 2024 will see significant progress on rollup scaling both on EIP-4844 and from rollups themselves.\n\nEthereum is also looking to fix its centralization issues through the Scourge. Per the roadmap, the focus will be on mitigating such concerns in the network\u2019s PoS design, especially around Maximal extractable value (MEV) and liquid staking or pooling. Buterin earlier recommended reducing the cost of running nodes to fix the challenge.\n\nEasing Block Verifications\n\nFurthermore, the roadmap mentioned the Verge, which could make block verification easier. Verkle trees are almost ready for inclusion, and soon, verifying blocks would only involve downloading some bytes of data, performing a few basic computations, and verifying a Succinct, Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARK).\n\nThe network would explore Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) verification precompile to arrive at a fully SNARKed Ethereum.\n\nIn addition, the Purge will simplify the protocol, eliminate technical debts, and limit network participation costs, while the Splurge will fix everything else.\n\n\u201c\u2018Increase L1 gas limit\u2019 was removed to emphasize that the limit can be raised *at any time*; no need to wait for full SNARKs esp for small increases. \u2018State expiry\u2019 has been shrunk, to reflect a general consensus that it\u2019s a fairly low-priority and low-urgency item esp given stateless clients and PBS / execution tickets,\u201d Buterin explained."

        "content": "Current Ethereum (ETH) on-chain data hints that the coin could soar as high as $5,100, the upper band of its next key target.\n\nTop market analyst Ali Martinez shared this hint, drawing insight from the Ethereum Market Value to Realized Value (MRVR) ratio. Using this metric, Martinez claimed that the next major price target for the coin lies within the $3,830 to $5,100 range.\n\nThis price range is highly ambitious for Ethereum, and while its All-Time High (ATH) of $4,891.70 falls in between this range, meaning it is achievable, current market dynamics hint at how challenging it might be to hit this price target in the short term.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum On-Chain Outlook\n\nMartinez is bullish on Ethereum, judging by his previous posts shared on the X platform. At the moment, Ethereum has no major supply barriers in sight, with a psychologically important resistance point set around the $2,700 zone. Should this level be flipped, Martinez believes there is no major obstacle ahead for the digital currency.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading for $2,399.10, up by more than 4% in the past 24 hours. The coin\u2019s market has jumped by 4% to $288,470,978,345, and trading volume has soared 60% to $10,933,692,743.\n\nPer the chart shared by Ali Martinez, Ethereum has at least four different Realized Price (RP) levels, including $1,275.57 and $1,594.46, which form the likely point the coin\u2019s price could slip to. These Realized Prices also hint at the upper band of $3,826.70 and $5,102.27, as pointed out by the analyst.\n\nAccording to the #Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands, the next key price targets for $ETH are $3,830 and $5,100! pic.twitter.com/cLo4crWkPF \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 1, 2024\n\nConflicting Ethereum Price Calls\n\nThe outlook on Ethereum has been quite controversial in recent times. Market experts like Ali Martinez and Michael van de Poppe are bullish on the coin as the latter denounced the idea that Ethereum is dead.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, Ethereum is not favored by legendary trader Peter Brandt, who is convinced the digital currency may not be around for the next ten years. Brandt, in his strong belief that Ethereum is poised to fall, revealed he had shorted the coin as he noted the coin could fall as low as $650 in the long term."

        "content": "As the bitcoin (BTC) price jumped 7% shooting past $45,000 in the wake of Bitcoin ETF approval, altcoins too joined the party. The Ethereum (ETH) price is up once again by 2% in the last 24 hours, moving closer to $2,400.\n\nOn-chain indicators for Ethereum continue to show strength, suggesting a much larger rally ahead from here onwards. Predictions are already strong that the ETH price can rally all the way to $10,000 by this year\u2019s end.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH) On-Chain Indicators\n\nIn a recent market analysis, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez expressed a bullish outlook for Ethereum (ETH). Martinez highlighted a promising path ahead for Ethereum, emphasizing the absence of significant supply barriers, which could pave the way for potential gains to $2,700 or beyond.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis pointed out a robust demand wall at $2,000, indicating substantial support that may act as a cushion in the event of corrections. The positive forecast aligns with the current market dynamics, reflecting optimism regarding Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory in the near term.\n\nIn insights shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands indicate pivotal price targets for the cryptocurrency. Martinez pointed out that, according to the data, the next significant price targets for Ethereum ($ETH) are identified at $3,830 and $5,100. This analysis provides valuable guidance for investors and market participants, shedding light on potential future price movements in the Ethereum market.\n\nETH Exchange Supply Falling Sharply\n\nAnother positive indicator for Ethereum is the sharp drop in the exchange supply. Data from Santiment reveals that the supply of ETH tokens on exchanges has reached an unprecedented all-time low since the inception of Ether.\n\nAs of the latest data, Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges represents only 8.04% of the total ETH supply. This marks the lowest level recorded since the cryptocurrency\u2019s genesis. The on-exchange supply of an altcoin like ETH often plays a crucial role in influencing its market price. A decrease in the supply is generally perceived as a bullish indicator, suggesting a potential reduction in selling pressure on ETH.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared a roadmap that seeks to improve the efficiency of the PoS system.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s monthly transaction count amounted to 36.02 million in January.\n\nThis is its highest monthly count since July 2022.\n\nDespite the surge in demand for the network, its NFT sales volume and DeFi TVL saw declines.\n\nEthereum (ETH) recorded a monthly transaction count of 36.02 million, marking its highest in 20 months.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Price Prediction: $2,500 in sight as bullish metrics steer ETH back into the channel\n\nSurge in user activity\n\nProof-of-Stake network Ethereum (ETH) experienced a significant increase in activity in January, recording its highest monthly transaction count since July 2022, according to The Block Data dashboard. Information from the data provider showed that during the 31-day period, transactions on the network totaled 36.02 million.\n\nEthereum monthly transaction count\n\nA rise in a Network\u2019s Transaction Count is often due to a corresponding uptick in user activity. Data from The Block showed that in January, the daily number of unique addresses that were active on Ethereum, either as a sender or receiver, rose by 4%. The Daily Active Addresses on Ethereum was 14.1 million, the highest recorded since October 2022.\n\nEthereum\u2019s NFT and DeFi verticals lose steam\n\nWhile the network saw an increase in user activity, the growth markers of Ethereum\u2019s non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystems showed a decline in both verticals in January.\n\nTo assess the performance of a network\u2019s NFT ecosystem, its sales volume is considered. Data from CryptoSlam showed that in January, NFT sales volume on Ethereum plummeted by 2%. According to the data provider, 138,465 NFT transactions were completed on the chain with a sales volume of $356 million.\n\nInterestingly, the fall in Ethereum\u2019s sales volume did not mirror the general market\u2019s performance. According to data from NFTGo, the total volume of NFT sales across all collections in January climbed by 41%.\n\nRegarding Ethereum\u2019s DeFi sector, it witnessed a 7% dip in its Total Value Locked (TVL) in the last month, per data from DefiLlama. At press time, Ethereum\u2019s DeFi TVL was $31.85B\n\nDouble-digit decline in network fees and revenue\n\nDespite the surge in user activity and demand for Ethereum in January, it took a significant hit to its transaction fees and revenue.\n\nEthereum Monthly Fee and Revenue\n\nData from Token Terminal showed that during the period under review, users paid a total of $213 million in fees to use Ethereum. This marked a 34% decline from the $325 million the network received as user fees in December.\n\nLikewise, the revenue it derived from last month\u2019s fees plunged by 37%. In January, Ethereum\u2019s monthly revenue totaled $179 million. In December, it was almost $290 million.\n\nWith the consistent sideways movement in ETH\u2019s price, the network may witness a decline in demand in February unless market sentiment improves. Should this happen, network fees and revenue may plunge further."

Bitcoin (BTC) 2024 Price Prediction\n\nSource: Pintrest\n\nInvestors are hopeful that the SEC will approve the much-awaited Bitcoin ETF before Q2 of 2024. The move will allow a flood of investments into the cryptocurrency markets, especially Bitcoin. The prices of BTC are expected to soar after the BTC ETF approval, which will eventually make other cryptocurrencies hit new highs. CoinShares has provided a bold prediction claiming that Bitcoin\u2019s price could climb above the $80,000 mark this year in 2024.\n\n\u201cEstimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000,\u201d said James Butterfill, CoinShares Head of Research to CNBC.\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Shibarium To Start Burning SHIB Tokens From January 2024\n\n2.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum network, made some interesting comments during a recent interview. One of them was his revelation of the worst thing that usually happens on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Worst Thing That Happens On Ethereum\n\nVitalik mentioned that the worst thing that happens on Ethereum is when people lose money. It is, however, worth mentioning that this particular comment came in relation to his earlier remarks about the impact that wars and dictators have on human lives. This was meant to be light-hearted in comparison to the \u201cheavy things\u201d he had just spoken about.\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik is of the opinion that crypto has a major role to play in any bid to curb the excesses of those in power. He said that crypto can \u201ccounter-pressure\u201d the powers of these governments and large corporations.\n\nCrypto is already doing this, as he highlighted how people have more control over their finances and the government cannot easily grab their money up to fund wars. He also alluded to ZK (Zero Knowledge) technology and how people can prove things about themselves without such information being maliciously used by the government.\n\nThese statements made by Vitalik once again emphasize the essence of cryptocurrencies and their role in creating a decentralized economy. As people continue to lose faith in the traditional financial system, crypto has provided a haven for those looking to have more control of their finances.\n\nETH price falls below $2,400 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nDigital Democracy On ETH\n\nVitalik also touched on Ethereum and the need to make certain protocol upgrades. He specifically noted how some of these upgrades are economic. For those, Vitalik believes there is a need for the Ethereum community to be more involved to avoid a similar system, which crypto aims to eliminate.\n\nTo achieve this, the Ethereum co-founder proposed innovating a better kind of democracy tool where members could use ZK votes to make their voices heard. At the same time, there will also be a need to develop tools that can weed out those who aren\u2019t actually part of the community, he said. That way, core ETH developers can actually implement upgrades that reflect the wishes of everyone in the community.\n\nVitalik also sounded optimistic about the future of Ethereum. He stated that the network has improved greatly and achieved \u201camazing success\u201d in terms of scaling and improving UX, security, and privacy. These, in his opinion, were some of Ethereum\u2019s biggest problems in the last 10 years.\n\nRegarding scaling, the ETH co-founder says the \u201cbiggest thing\u201d that happened in 2023 was the fact that Rollups became more secure. These layer-2 networks could help Ethereum potentially scale to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nFeatured image from Coingape, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "The Dawn of a New Era in NFTs: Exploring the Rise of Alternative Layer 1s\n\nAs we venture into 2024, the NFT landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, with alternative Layer 1 blockchains like Solana (SOL), Tezos, and SEI emerging as significant players. This shift marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the NFT ecosystem, diversifying the platforms on which digital art and collectibles thrive.\n\n1. Diversification Beyond Ethereum: A Breath of Fresh Air for NFTs\n\nHistorically, Ethereum has been the dominant force in the NFT space. However, alternative Layer 1s like SOL, Tezos, and SEI offer fresh opportunities. Their unique features, such as lower transaction fees and faster processing times, make them attractive to artists and collectors seeking new avenues for NFT creation and trade.\n\n2. Niche Communities and Innovative Use-Cases\n\nThese alternative blockchains are carving out niche communities and fostering innovative use-cases. For instance, Tezos has become a hub for eco-conscious artists due to its energy-efficient design, while SEI\u2019s high throughput is appealing for high-frequency trading NFTs.\n\n3. Enhanced Scalability and Performance\n\nScalability remains a key concern in the NFT space. Alternative Layer 1s address this issue head-on, offering superior scalability and performance compared to older blockchains. This feature is crucial as the NFT market expands and requires more efficient infrastructure.\n\n4. Tailored Solutions for Diverse Needs\n\nEach of these alternative Layer 1s brings tailored solutions to the table. Solana, known for its lightning-fast speeds, is ideal for projects that require quick transactions. Tezos, on the other hand, appeals to those prioritizing eco-friendliness.\n\n5. Growing Ecosystems and Partnerships\n\nThe expanding ecosystems and partnerships surrounding these blockchains are a testament to their growing influence. Collaborations with artists, brands, and tech companies are broadening the scope and appeal of NFTs on these platforms.\n\nBTC\u2019s Entry into NFTs: Ordinals and Inscriptions\n\n2024 also witnesses a groundbreaking development in the NFT space with Bitcoin (BTC) introducing ordinals and inscriptions. This new concept involves directly inscribing digital assets onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, adding a fresh dimension to the NFT market.\n\nThe Significance of Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals\n\nBitcoin\u2019s foray into the NFT world is notable for several reasons. Firstly, it leverages the robust security and widespread recognition of the Bitcoin network. Secondly, ordinals introduce a unique way of tokenizing assets, differing from traditional NFT standards. This innovation could attract a new wave of collectors and creators, eager to explore the possibilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nImplications for the NFT Landscape\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions is poised to enrich the NFT landscape. It not only expands the range of blockchain options for NFTs but also brings the credibility and stability of Bitcoin to the forefront of digital art and collectibles.\n\nThe Unstoppable Rise of Layer 2s: Ethereum\u2019s Counter\n\nWhile alternative Layer 1s and Bitcoin\u2019s new venture are making waves, Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions, particularly Arbitrum, are not to be overlooked, especially in the gaming sector. Arbitrum is poised to extend its lead in 2024, offering a blend of Ethereum\u2019s security with enhanced scalability and lower fees, making it ideal for NFT-based games.\n\nConclusion: A Balanced NFT Future\n\n2024 promises to be a landmark year for NFTs, with both alternative Layer 1s, Bitcoin\u2019s innovative ordinals, and Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum playing critical roles. This balanced growth ensures a vibrant, diverse, and technologically advanced NFT ecosystem.\n\nTLDR: 2024 marks the rise of alternative Layer 1 blockchains like Solana, Tezos, and SEI in the NFT space, alongside Bitcoin\u2019s introduction of ordinals and inscriptions, offering diversification, niche communities, scalability, and tailored solutions. Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions, especially Arbitrum, continue to be pivotal, particularly in NFT gaming. The year promises a balanced and thriving NFT ecosystem."

        "content": "SOLANA: BOOM TIMES OR BLIP? Solana's SOL token, which crashed in price from over $200 in 2021 to under $10 in 2022, has buoyed back above $100 in recent months, making it one one the biggest beneficiaries of the recent crypto market surge. The Solana blockchain was pilloried last cycle for its close ties to Sam Bankman-Fried and its spotty track record of network outages. SOL's latest price gains have been viewed by some as a signal of wider confidence in the ecosystem \u2013 an indication that traders see sordid company and performance issues as problems of the past. But the gains to SOL were accelerated in large part by auxiliary memes and airdrops, with a frenzy towards a few Solana-based tokens driving much of the hype. The biggest winner was BONK, a meme coin that has lept in price by over 200% in the past 30 days. (A funny side-plot to the BONK boom is that it was airdropped to owners of the Solana phone, which suffered from dismal sales until people realized they could buy it to nab BONK tokens, which were for a time worth more than the device itself.) Other winners included Pyth, a Solana-focused oracle network that recently launched a token; and Jito, a liquid-staking service whose just-airdropped JTO token marked a huge payday for some unsuspecting users. The Solana network has seen some technical improvements in the past couple of years, but, as is often the case in the world of blockchains, it remains to be seen whether the positive market developments were driven by genuine adoption of the speed-focused blockchain ecosystem, or by traders that will soon leave in favor of other buzzy bets."

        "content": "Unpacking altcoin predictions for 2024, focusing on Ethereum\u2019s advancements, Solana\u2019s market position, and the trajectories of promising altcoins.\n\nAs 2023 has come to a close, let\u2019s delve into the altcoins forecast and find out what might be next for these digital currencies.\n\nThroughout 2023, a few top altcoins stood out due to their impressive performance and notable advancements.\n\nInjective Protocol (INJ) leads the pack, showcasing a growth of over 3000% over the past year. This surge can be attributed to several factors, including its mainnet upgrade, which introduced new features like message signing, advanced balance indexing, and upgraded WASM smart contracts.\n\nFollowing closely is Immutable (IMX), which experienced over 490% surge. Immutable stood out for its approach to decentralized trading, aiming to offer a fully decentralized and trustless on-chain order book-based DEX development infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, THORchain (RUNE), another rising altcoin, saw its value increase over 340% last year despite difficult market conditions, reflecting the growing ecosystem of the Cosmos-based blockchain protocols.\n\nWhile the past performance of best-performing altcoins like INJ and IMX offers insights, the focus shifts to what the future holds, especially for the most promising altcoins for 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper and uncover the potential trends that could shape the altcoin price prediction in the upcoming year.\n\nEthereum L2s could gain the momentum\n\nIn 2024, the altcoin market, especially Ethereum (ETH) and its layer 2 (L2s) networks, is brimming with potential.\n\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade, EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), could significantly reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability. This is crucial for L2 chains like Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP).\n\nVanEck predicts that this upgrade could usher in a more efficient altcoin market. Particularly, it\u2019s anticipated that within a year, Ethereum\u2019s L2 networks will consolidate to 2-3 dominant players. These platforms could be major contributors to the altcoin forecast for 2024.\n\nVanEck even suggests that one of the best altcoins for 2024 could be the layer 2 network that surpasses Ethereum in monthly DEX volume and total value locked (TVL).\n\nThis increase in efficiency is likely to attract more trading volume and arbitrage opportunities, making these L2 networks some of the most promising altcoins for 2024.\n\nSolana could make strides in 2024\n\nAccording to VanEck analysts, Solana (SOL) is expected to emerge as a top-three blockchain in terms of market cap, TVL, and active users. This rise is attributed to Solana\u2019s clear scalability roadmap, which may give it an edge over competitors like Ethereum.\n\nSolana\u2019s defi ecosystem, already among the top five in TVL, has witnessed an impressive surge to around $1.5 billion as of January 2024 from $300 million levels in October.\n\nThis growth is spread across a vast number of wallet addresses and protocols, indicating a strong and active network.\n\nMoreover, VanEck analysts also predict that along with Bitcoin ETFs, several asset managers could file for Solana-based spot ETFs. This move could enhance Solana\u2019s visibility and attract further investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s expected growth in TVL through Pyth, a Solana-based price oracle, could help Solana gain a substantial market share.\n\nThese developments suggest that Solana could be one of the most promising altcoins for 2024. Its potential growth in market cap, TVL, and user base, along with its probable venture into ETFs could redefine altcoin future predictions, especially in the DeFi sector.\n\nMost promising altcoins for 2024\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s (XRP) ongoing lawsuit with the SEC remains a crucial factor for its future. As of January, Ripple had secured some partial victories in court, with a key ruling stating that past XRP sales were not investment contract offers.\n\nThis has provided Ripple with a temporary advantage in the case. The lawsuit is expected to be resolved in spring 2024, and a favorable outcome for Ripple could positively influence XRP\u2019s market value.\n\nThe anticipation of this resolution has been contributing to fluctuations in XRP\u2019s price, with notable buying activity from large-scale investors hinting that it could positively impact altcoin\u2019s price prediction.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been making strides as a decentralized platform for building and launching custom blockchain applications.\n\nIts consensus mechanism aims to enable rapid transaction finality and low transaction fees, making it an attractive platform for developers.\n\nThe growth of the defi market in 2024 could benefit AVAX, especially as it offers a scalable and user-friendly platform alternative to more established blockchains like Ethereum\u200b\u200b, making it one of the most promising altcoins.\n\nLido DAO (LIDO)\n\nLido DAO (LIDO) has gained significant attention due to its role in liquid staking, particularly on the Ethereum network. It has become a major contributor to Ethereum\u2019s TVL, highlighting its growing importance in the DeFi space.\n\nThe success and innovations in liquid staking and its impact on Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem put LIDO in the race to become one of the best altcoins for 2024.\n\nPolkadot (DOT)\n\nPolkadot\u2019s (DOT) parachain feature has been a key factor in its growth. This feature allows multiple blockchains to connect and interact within the Polkadot network while maintaining their independent operations.\n\nThe potential for interoperability and the facilitation of cross-chain communication could make DOT one of the best-performing altcoins for 2024\u200b.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe altcoin forecast for 2024 appears both promising and challenging. Investors eyeing the best altcoins for 2024 should remain vigilant, considering the volatile nature of the crypto market.\n\nFor those seeking the most promising altcoins for 2024, it\u2019s essential to look beyond just the hype and deeply analyze the technological advancements, market trends, and regulatory shifts that could impact these digital assets.\n\nYou must exercise caution as the crypto market is notoriously fast-paced. While the potential for high returns is significant, so is the risk of loss.\n\nHappy investing, and don\u2019t forget the golden rule: never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the best altcoins to buy in 2024? Looking towards 2024, some of the best altcoins to consider for investment include the ones that match your risk appetite and investment goals. You should conduct thorough research and stay updated with the latest market trends when considering these most promising altcoins for 2024. Are altcoins a good investment? Altcoins can be a good investment, but they also come with a high level of risk due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Due diligence, ongoing market research, and a careful altcoin forecast approach are key to making informed decisions in this space. Which altcoins can explode in 2024? Predicting which altcoins will explode in 2024 involves speculation, but based on current trends and developments, altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple, Avalanche, Lido DAO, and Polkadot show considerable promise. However, the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and investors should keep an eye on market trends to identify the best altcoins for 2024."

        "title": "Countdown to Dencun Upgrade: Will Ethereum Price\u2019s Rally? - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Ethereum is in the spotlight as its Dencun upgrade inches close. Will Ethereum break above $3,000?\n\nAccording to Ethereum Foundation Protocol Support Tim Beiko, Ethereum\u2019s next upgrade, Dencun, will be released on January 18. Dencun is set to launch on the Goerli testnet first, with later deployments on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets on January 31 and February 7, 2024, respectively. The mainnet launch is slated for February 2024.\n\nWill this new upgrade makes things better for ETH?\n\nDencun Slated for Q1/2024\n\nDencun was initially expected to launch in late 2023, but concerns about testnet deployment timelines and consensus issues prompted Ethereum\u2019s core developers to delay its implementation. While the event is now slated for early 2024, the team hasn\u2019t finalized the upgrade dates.\n\nThe upgrade will introduce proto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, to boost data storage and improve the efficiency and scalability of rollups using \u201cblobs.\u201d Blobs are essentially chunks of data, much larger than typical Ethereum transactions, that can be attached to blocks. They can hold up to 125 kilobytes of information, compared to the standard transaction size of about 250 bytes.\n\nThe process is expected to positively impact Ethereum\u2019s scaling protocols, such as a drop in transaction fees and network security. Layer 2 solutions have gained significant traction over the past few months due to their cost advantages. However, concerns persist surrounding their security and decentralization. With Dencun, Ethereum seeks to address these challenges within rollups and enhance the performance of bridges and staking protocols.\n\nRecent tests signified widespread acceptance of the Dencun upgrade among Ethereum nodes, with a 99% participation rate. Meanwhile, 95% of data blobs propagated in under two seconds, which suggests that the coming upgrade could result in potential improvements in scalability and network efficiency.\n\nDencun\u2019s impact extends far beyond technical upgrades. It marks a turning point for the Ethereum ecosystem, paving the way for explosive growth and groundbreaking innovation.\n\nEnhanced data storage, streamlined transactions, and boosted scalability unlock new possibilities. These ripples will be felt across the entire community, nurturing an environment where groundbreaking developments can flourish and a more inclusive, robust digital economy takes root.\n\nOn December 31, Ethereum\u2019s creator, Vitalik Buterin, issued the blockchain\u2019s 2024 roadmap. The key highlights are the application of single-slot finality to solve the problems of the proof-of-stake mechanism, Dencun implementation, solutions to miner extractable value (MAV), the centralization of liquid staking, and Ethereum\u2019s design simplification.\n\nIn a post published on December 27, Vitalik suggested three ways to make Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake \u201cconsiderably simpler and lighter.\u201d He proposed reducing validator signatures to 8192, encompassing decentralized staking, two-tiered staking, and rotating validator participation. His proposal aims to ease the system\u2019s technical load while maintaining efficiency, security, and decentralization.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Outlook\n\nAlong with the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, Ethereum enthusiasts eagerly await the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision on spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Market observers believe the SEC\u2019s upcoming ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs, expected by January 10th, could serve as a catalyst for approving spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nMajor institutions like BlackRock, ARK Invest, VanEck, Fidelity, Invesco, and Grayscale have all filed applications for spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. While no approvals have been granted, the SEC extended its decision deadline for these proposals to May 2024. However, with the outcome of spot Bitcoin ETF filings looming, analysts anticipate a similar one for spot Ethereum ETFs likely to follow.\n\nEthereum is trading at around $2,300 at current prices. There\u2019s growing anticipation in the crypto community about Ethereum\u2019s potential to reach new heights this year in alignment with a series of important events. If an ETF hits the markets in 2024, ETH\u2019s price will likely rise.\n\nNow, we just have to wait and see how the upgrade goes, and what the 2024 crypto market brings."

According to data from analytics firms, Bitcoin NFT sales crossed $881 million in December 2023.\n\nBitcoin NFTs outperform Ethereum counterparts\n\nEthereum (ETH) has traditionally recorded the largest NFT sales volumes. However, the recent surge in Ordinal Inscriptions has seen Bitcoin increasingly become a viable option for digital collectibles.\n\nWhile Bitcoin NFT sales neared the billion mark, Ethereum recorded more than two times less, at $364.79 million.\n\nThe Solana (SOL) Network registered an over 300% spike in its NFT sales volumes compared to the previous month. This helped it to record $325.14 million in nonfungible token sales, taking the third spot ahead of Polygon (MATIC) and Arbitrum (ARB) with their $47,590,789.81 and $28,327,354.00 in NFT sales, respectively.\n\nGraph showing Bitcoin NFT sale volumes in 2023. Source: Crypto Slam\n\nAccording to the Cryptoslam data portal, the Bitcoin network reached over 111,000 unique buyers and 98,744 unique sellers in December. The average sale value for the month stood at $1,785.57.\n\nWill NFT sales volumes hold up in January?\n\nDespite the impressive numbers registered by the Bitcoin network, overall NFT sales saw a 35% plunge in the last week of December. This, however, did not prevent transactions from reaching a whopping $1.7 billion in the last month of the year.\n\nThe spike in Bitcoin NFT sales volume has ignited optimism in the market. Industry watchers are optimistic that the possible approval of spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024 will boost overall markets, including those of nonfungible tokens.\n\nHowever, not everyone has rushed to celebrate. As crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out, a correction often follows Bitcoin\u2019s strong fourth quarter (Q4) in the following January.\n\nAnalyst Ali Matinez\u2019s post about the Bitcoin price performance. Source: X\n\nWith BTC price surging above $42,500 in the recent rally, the markets can see a large dump in the coming days. This will translate to investors drawing profits, pushing NFT floor prices down.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin NFT sale volumes have emerged as the winner among major networks."

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined the 2024 roadmap for the blockchain platform, emphasizing the continuity of its technical direction with only minor changes from the previous year. His recent series of posts and a detailed chart provide insights into the future of Ethereum, focusing on enhancing its proof-of-stake (PoS) design and aligning with the original cypherpunk ideals.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStrengthening Ethereum\u2019s PoS Consensus\n\nA pivotal aspect of Ethereum's ongoing evolution is the enhancement of its PoS consensus mechanism. The Merge, a significant milestone achieved in September 2022, marked the transition of Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a PoS system.\n\nThis transition notably reduced the network\u2019s energy consumption, representing a major step towards a more sustainable blockchain infrastructure. Buterin has emphasized the role of single-slot finality (SSF) in improving Ethereum's PoS design.\n\nSSF is crucial in ensuring that changes to a blockchain block are irreversible, thereby enhancing the security and efficiency of the network. According to Buterin, SSF presents the most straightforward approach to address current weaknesses in Ethereum's PoS design, solidifying its technical path forward.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nReviving Ethereum's Cypherpunk Roots\n\nButerin also expressed his desire to revive the original vision of Ethereum as a \"public decentralized shared hard drive,\" which aligns with the principles of the cypherpunk movement.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCypherpunks advocate for the use of encryption to maintain privacy and autonomy, especially against government surveillance. The shift towards financialization in 2017, as Buterin notes, somewhat veered Ethereum away from these foundational values.\n\nHowever, with the advent of technologies such as rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and second-generation privacy solutions, there's a renewed opportunity to realign Ethereum with these cypherpunk ideals.\n\nThese technologies not only enhance privacy and security but also streamline and optimize the network's operations. Buterin's roadmap for 2024 reflects a commitment to technological innovation while staying true to the platform's original ethos.\n\nThe focus remains on strengthening the PoS consensus mechanism, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring privacy and decentralization \u2014 core tenets that have always underpinned the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "content": "JAKARTA - The Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a decentralized domain name service running on the Ethereum blockchain, experienced a significant price increase on January 3, 2024. This was triggered by support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who called ENS a \"very important\" service and had to be \"affordable\".\n\nAccording to data from Bitcoin.com Markets, ENS tokens rose more than 50 percent a day, from $8.28 (Rp 128,600) to $16.01 (Rp 248,700). This is the highest level ever achieved by ENS tokens since its launch in March 2023.\n\nButerin, who also has a 'vitalic.eth' domain at ENS, expressed its support through platform X (formerly Twitter). In X's post, Buterin emphasized the importance of ENS to be accessible and affordable, especially on layer two (L2) networks such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon.\n\nFor your information alone, L2 is a scalability solution that allows Ethereum transactions to be processed outside the main chain (mainnet) at lower costs and higher speeds. According to Bitcoin.com, to use ENS in L2, a CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) resistor is required. The CCIP resolator is a protocol that facilitates communication and resolution of data between different blockchain networks.\n\nWith the CCIP resolator, users can register, update, and read ENS subdomains directly on L2, without having to return to the mainnet. ENS subdomains are human-readable names that replace complex alphanumeric wallet addresses. For example, if you have 'example.eth' domains, you can create subdomains such as 'dompet1.omen.eth' and 'dompet2.examp.eth'.\n\nENS is a decentralized naming service that functions similar to traditional DNS (Domain Name System) on the internet. However, in contrast to DNS controlled by central authorities, ENS is fully owned and operated by the Ethereum community. ENS can not only complete domain names to Ethereum addresses, but also to other information such as IPFS addresses, social media profiles, and personal data.\n\nENS is expected to increase the ease of use and adoption of Ethereum, by providing a flexible and secure digital identity for users. In addition, ENS can also open new opportunities for developers and entrepreneurs to create ENS-based applications and services. Some examples of apps that already use ENS are Uniswap, MetaMask, OpenSea, and Etherscan.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

Its robust development community and status as one of the best-performing blockchain networks in Web3 contribute to its appeal. Additionally, new project partnerships with major global businesses are expected to drive further adoption of the blockchain among mainstream markets\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nInvestment Prospects\n\nFor investors, the question remains whether Solana is a good long-term investment. With its current performance and the predictions for 2024, Solana presents a range of opportunities. While some predictions indicate a short-term decrease, the overall sentiment remains bullish. The forecasted price range for 2024 shows stability, with potential highs and lows offering a spectrum of investment possibilities\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nIn 2024, Solana\u2019s trajectory reflects a blend of strong market trends, technological advancements, and strategic partnerships. Despite the challenges it faced in the past, the predictions and developments suggest a promising year ahead for SOL, making it a noteworthy cryptocurrency for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Future of Cryptocurrency: Key Market Factors\n\nIt\u2019s essential to consider the broader market factors that will shape the future of these digital assets. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex interplay of technological advancements, regulatory landscapes, and global economic factors.\n\nKey Market Factors\n\nRegulatory Developments: The evolving regulatory environment is a critical factor in the cryptocurrency market.

The digital currencies we\u2019ve explored\u2014Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana\u2014alongside others in the market, present a dynamic and evolving landscape. As we witness the continued integration of blockchain technology into various sectors, the potential for growth and innovation remains vast. However, this potential comes with the need for vigilance, as regulatory, economic, and technological changes continue to shape the path of these digital assets. For those engaged in the cryptocurrency market, 2024 will undoubtedly be a year to watch closely."

Solana has its own digital currency called Solana (SOL), which is currently sixth in the list of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is the most popular blockchain that supports decentralized (DApps) and smart contract applications. Ethereum uses the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, but plans to switch to PoS through an Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Ethereum has its own digital currency called Ether (ETH), which is currently second-ranked on the largest crypto list by market cap.\n\nAccording to Google Trends data, searches for \"Solana\" surpassed searches for \"Ethereum\" for the first time since they were launched in 2020 and 2015, respectively. This shift occurred in the period 17 December to 23 December 2023, marking a significant turning point for the crypto.\n\nIn this period, interest in Solana reached a score of 56, exceeding the Ethereum score of only 50. This score shows the relative popularity of the search term on a scale of 0 to 100. Google data also predicts that interest in Solana will continue to increase until it reaches a score of 100 in the period from December 24 to December 30, 2023, which indicates the \"peak of popularity\" of the term.\n\nThe increase in interest in Solana reflects the impressive price and development of its ecosystem. In 2023, SOL has increased by more than 10,000%, from about $1% in January to about 107 in December. Solana has also launched various projects and initiatives, such as Ignition,tenhole, Metaplex, and Audius, which attracted many developers and users.\n\nSolana Popular In Spain And The Philippines\n\nIn terms of regional search, Google Trends revealed that countries such as Spain and the Philippines are at the forefront of interest in Solana. People in these countries note more users looking for the term \"Solana\" than \"Ethereum\" in 2023.\n\nSpain has a score of 100 for the search for \"Solana\", while the Philippines has a score of 97. Other countries that also show high interest in Solana are India, Pakistan, and Turkey, with scores of 93, 92, and 91, respectively.\n\nEven so, Ethereum still maintains its dominance in countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, and Morocco, with each having a score of 100, 99, and 98 for the search for \"Ethereum\".\n\nGoogle data also reveals that people looking for Solana are also curious about other activities in the blockchain ecosystem. Users are also looking for meme coin projects such as \"Bonks\" and \"Tensors\", which are Solana-based crypto assets and NFTs.\n\nBonk is a dog-shaped meme coin that has recently surged in popularity. On December 8, 2023, Bonk surpassed Pepecoin (PEPE) as the third largest meme coin by market cap. Bonk has seen an increase of about 370% in recent weeks.\n\nThe tensor is Solana-based NFT marketplace that allows NFT traders and creators to buy and create digital artwork on the platform. Project creators are responsible for the NFT collection known as Tensorians. In the last 30 days, this collection has seen a substantial increase despite reduced interest in NFT since last year's boom.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has recently revealed the blockchain\u2019s 2024 roadmap, indicating that it largely mirrors the plans set out in the previous year, with a few minor tweaks.\n\nIn a sequence of updates shared on the platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Buterin discussed Ethereum\u2019s ongoing development, concentrating on six key areas: the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge. Accompanying his explanation was a comprehensive chart detailing these components, along with annotations and diagrams.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThe focal point of the roadmap remains the Merge, a significant milestone achieved in September 2022, where Ethereum\u2019s mainnet was successfully merged with the Beacon Chain, transitioning from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. This shift has notably reduced the network\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nButerin also emphasized advancements in Ethereum\u2019s single-slot finality (SSF). SSF is increasingly seen as a straightforward solution for addressing several existing weaknesses in Ethereum\u2019s PoS design. The concept of finality in blockchain refers to the assurance that once a block is added, reversing it would require burning a substantial portion of the total staked Ether.\n\nThis development aligns with Buterin\u2019s broader vision of reviving the \u201ccypherpunk\u201d ethos within Ethereum, a movement emphasizing the use of encryption and privacy technologies to safeguard against government surveillance. Buterin lamented that Ethereum\u2019s original vision as a decentralized platform for peer-to-peer messaging and file storage had been overshadowed by financial applications since 2017.\n\nHe remains hopeful, however, that the increasing mainstream adoption of technologies such as rollups, zero-knowledge proofs, account abstraction, and advanced privacy solutions will reinforce these cypherpunk values within the Ethereum ecosystem."
