        "title": "Ethereum, and blockchain technologies, are threatened by Washington regulators - The Dallas Morning News",
        "content": "The Texas \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d is a well-established fact and the latest data from the Texas Work Commission backs it up: In this year\u2019s first quarter, the state enjoyed the largest increase in nonagricultural employment across the country, posted record-high levels of jobs and logged its 36th consecutive month of positive annual growth.\n\nTexas has built on this momentum and emerged as a decisive leader for so-called Web3 innovation. In other words, that\u2019s the decentralization of blockchain technologies and token-based economics. Blockchain is the mechanism that records digital transactions across computers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is no accident: Texas legislators have intentionally crafted pro-crypto policies which have, in turn, attracted a robust ecosystem of developers and miners. And the state\u2019s deregulated power market allows for access to inexpensive power complemented by a healthy mix from renewables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just some of the reasons we relocated our company, Consensys, from New York to North Texas last year. We were confident that Texas would be the optimal home for our core offerings, built on Ethereum \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain \u2014 and powered by ether, the digital commodity that underpins it.\n\nOpinion Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nMore precisely, we concluded that Texas\u2019 unique alchemy of business-savvy leaders, encouragement of innovation and stable regulatory environment would allow Consensys to help shepherd the next phase of the internet\u2019s development. The hallmarks of this next phase \u2014 transparency, security, and accessibility, all controlled by the user, not any big tech company \u2014 are undeniably ground-breaking. That\u2019s why companies around the world are already building software applications to run on Ethereum. And why the biggest asset managers in the world are working on asset tokenization using Ethereum.\n\nYet all this potential is under imminent attack from unelected regulators in Washington. Without legal authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in the process of arbitrarily reclassifying ether from a commodity to a security so that it can enforce the sort of registration and other requirements that attach to securities (such as bonds, stocks and other investments) under its jurisdiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut ether is plainly and logically not a security. On multiple occasions, the SEC itself has affirmed this point \u2014 as has its sister agency Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 and our entire business model has been built against the backdrop of this clear, prior regulatory consensus.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s regulatory escalation belies fundamental principles of separation of powers, where it is the job of Congress to legislate and assign jurisdiction over blockchains like Ethereum. Texas knows all too well the risks inherent in federal regulatory overreach and the SEC\u2019s proposed power grab in this instance is unlawful, unwarranted and arbitrary. It also directly and materially impacts Texas by dismantling a growing sector that both supports highly-skilled Texas jobs and represents the cutting edge of technology, the way we store our data and the future of our digital interactions.\n\nMore broadly, if the SEC prevails, it spells the end of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States by rendering ether functionally inaccessible and unusable. Software developers in Texas and around the country wishing to create applications that are interoperable with Ethereum would have to register as securities broker-dealers with the SEC itself, a draconian step that would basically outlaw all current software development in the U.S. relating to Ethereum as well as everyday transactions in ether that are essential to on-chain transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe hope the state of Texas, no stranger to aggressively fighting federal regulatory overreach, joins us in halting the SEC in its tracks. We took a major step recently by filing litigation against the SEC, asking a federal court to order the SEC to end its unlawful campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe urge Texans who value innovation and economic independence to follow suit, support this unfortunate but all-too-necessary effort, and preserve the state\u2019s hard-earned leadership position at the forefront of Web3 innovation.\n\nJoseph Lubin is co-founder of Ethereum and founder and CEO of Consensys.\n\nWe welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor.

        "title": "Why the US election will decide the fate of Ethereum ETFs - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum spot ETFs will likely be denied on May 23.\n\nProspective issuers probably won\u2019t sue the SEC \u2014 even though the strategy worked to get Bitcoin ETFs out.\n\nThe US election may hold the key to an approval.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission will probably deny applications for Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds on May 23.\n\nThe lack of meaningful interaction with prospective issuers, coupled with Ethereum\u2019s ambiguous regulatory status, have made analysts pessimistic about the chances.\n\nNot to mention the SEC\u2019s recent investigation into the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThat means spot Ethereum ETFs probably won\u2019t see the light until the end of 2025, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told DL News.\n\nFaced with a rejection, prospective ETF issuers \u2014 like BlackRock, Fidelity, or Ark Invest \u2014 have two options: either sue the SEC like Grayscale did for the Bitcoin spot ETFs, or file again at a later date.\n\nFactoring into the equation is the US election. Should former President Donald Trump win a second term in the White House, the SEC is likely to face a change of leadership. And a new chair could be friendlier towards crypto than Gary Gensler.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a new president, you file again,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cMaybe you get approved. Or you sue. Either way, that will take a whole other year to play out.\u201d\n\nSuing the SEC\n\nThe SEC spent years shooting down Bitcoin spot ETF applications before Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the regulator in protest in 2022.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn September, a judge found that the SEC had acted in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner by denying the applications. Four months later, the Bitcoin ETFs were launched.\n\nStill, it\u2019s unlikely that the strategy will be replicated for Ethereum ETFs. For one, Grayscale will probably not bring the fire to the SEC a second time, Balchunas told DL News.\n\nLawsuits are expensive \u2014 not just in terms of money, but in attention and bandwidth too. And after suffering massive outflows when its Bitcoin trust was converted into an ETF, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Grayscale did not aggressively pursue a conversion of its Ethereum trust.\n\nOther prospective issuers, meanwhile, won\u2019t dare pick up the baton and sue the regulator themselves, Balchunas said.\n\n\u201cNone of these other firms want to piss off the SEC,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cGrayscale was unique in that it wasn\u2019t a big ETF issuer. The rest of these firms have other things going on, and they\u2019re more scared.\u201d \u201cNobody else will step up,\u201d he added.\n\nElection time\n\nAnd why sue the SEC when the US presidential election, slated this November, may solve the problem?\n\nWith Trump leading in some polls, the odds that a new SEC chair will be appointed are higher than previously expected.\n\n\u201cTrump is not necessarily pro-crypto,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cRemember his previous SEC chief Jay Clayton didn\u2019t allow that ETF either. So he\u2019s not going to be like, \u2018let\u2019s just go crazy.\u2019 But he\u2019ll probably still be better for crypto and spot ETFs.\u201d\n\nAssuming a new chair is appointed in April or May, and filings submitted immediately afterwards, that could bring the deadline for approval or rejection to somewhere around December 2025.\n\nAlternatively, issuers could try to file as soon as the election is over \u2014 or even before results are in \u2014 to speed up the timeline.\n\nAnd if Joe Biden wins?\n\n\u201cIn the past cycles, when they denied spot Bitcoin ETFs, there was usually a cooling off period for like a year where nobody did anything,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cAnd then out of the blue someone is like, \u2018Oh, the hell with it\u2019 and files again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy guess is that issuers will take the summer, lick their wounds, just be bummed, and then see what happens in the election,\u201d he added.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nMarkus Thielen, research CEO at 10x Research, has cast a spotlight on Ethereum's trajectory, suggesting a potential decline to $2,500. His analysis points to weak fundamentals within the Ethereum network that could not only affect its value but also pose a hindrance to Bitcoin's progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, often touted as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. However, in this present cycle, Ethereum remains a basket case.\n\nAccording to the 10x researcher, Ethereum was the driving force during the 2020/2021 cycle because it was intended to replace the legacy banking system. NFT minting opened up new avenues for cryptocurrency acceptance, which may have evolved into other personalized papers on the blockchain, resulting in widespread \"wallet\" adoption. However, the Ethereum developers did not respond quickly enough.\n\n#Ethereum -> see you at $2,500\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc471-14) Ethereum remains this cycle\u2019s basket case.

Thielen points out a high correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum, with an R-square of 95%. Ethereum\u2019s weak fundamentals are becoming a roadblock for Bitcoin, preventing large-scale fiat inflows into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, he says.\n\nThielen's forecast coincides with a period of increased uncertainty and volatility, with the cryptocurrency market under selling pressure. At the time of writing, ETH has fallen 4.32% in the last 24 hours to $2,902, matching the sell-off in the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, amid the hype and market rally surrounding the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin holders' unrealized profits increased far quicker than those of Ethereum investors. The Bitcoin NUPL metric surpassed 0.5 and reached the euphoria phase three months before the equivalent metric for Ethereum."

        "content": "Over the years, analysts and developers have touted Ethereum as a deflationary network, presenting the blockchain as ultrasound, aligning with Bitcoin\u2019s sound money principle. However, that seems to have changed with the network\u2019s latest upgrade.\n\nCryptoQuant analysts revealed in the firm\u2019s latest weekly report that Ethereum ceased to be a deflationary network after the Dencun upgrade, implemented in March, which reduced the blockchain\u2019s transaction fees by a substantial amount.\n\nThe Ultrasound Money Narrative\n\nEthereum\u2019s ultrasound money narrative refers to the network as a system that maintains its purchasing power over time and stays resistant to inflation. Compared to Bitcoin, the term suggests that Ethereum has the potential to remain more sound by not just preserving purchasing power but reducing the supply of the network\u2019s token, ether (ETH), over time.\n\nIn the nine years of its existence, Ethereum has implemented several upgrades to sustain the decrease in its inflationary rate or the issuance of new ETH.\n\nThe London upgrade, implemented in August 2021, introduced a mechanism that burned a portion of Ethereum\u2019s gas fees, removing ETH from circulation with every transaction. The upgrade exerted deflationary pressure on ETH supply, making it more valuable and scarce over time.\n\nIn September 2022, developers implemented the Merge, transitioning Ethereum from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake network. The blockchain stopped issuing new ETH as block rewards to miners, drastically reducing the issuance and inflation rate of the crypto asset.\n\nThese two upgrades had deflationary effects on Ethereum until Dencun came along.\n\nEthereum is No Longer Deflationary\n\nDencun reduced transaction fees on Ethereum layer-2 chains and introduced danksharding, which allows the storage of additional data in blobs, making the network more efficient and less expensive.\n\nBefore the Dencun upgrade, the amount of fees burned on Ethereum was positively correlated with higher network activity; ETH supply was reduced faster, and more fees were burned due to higher network activity. However, the reduction of network fees has slashed the amount of ETH burned despite high activity.\n\nThe new supply of ETH has become positive again, increasing to its highest daily rate since the Merge, while the amount of fees burned has plummeted significantly. Hence, Ethereum is no longer deflationary.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that, at the current rate of network activity, Ethereum will not be deflationary again, the narrative of \u2018Ultra sound\u2019 money has probably died or would need much more higher network activity to come back to life,\u201d CryptoQuant stated."

        "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has taken a significant turn with the growth of its supply reaching the fastest daily rate since the historic transition known as the Merge.\n\nThis acceleration in the growth of supply has been triggered by a significant decrease in the amount of transaction fees burned, a change attributable to the recent Dencun update.\n\nThe Merge and Dencun increase the supply of Ethereum\n\nThe Merge, which took place in September 2022, was a monumental change for Ethereum, transitioning from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS).\n\nThis transition not only marked a significant reduction in the network\u2019s energy consumption of over 99%, but also introduced a new mechanism for managing transaction fees and creating new ETH.\n\nWith PoS, the concept of \u201cburning\u201d transaction fees was intended to make Ethereum potentially deflationary, depending on the network\u2019s activity levels.\n\nThe Dencun update, recently implemented, has introduced further adjustments to the Ethereum fee market. This update has inadvertently led to a drastic reduction in the number of transaction fees burned.\n\nInitially, the combustion mechanism was designed to offset the emission of new ETH, thus controlling inflation and, in some cases, aiming to reduce the total supply when more fees were burned than issued.\n\nHowever, after Dencun, the dynamics have changed. The decrease in the burning of fees has led to a net increase in the circulating supply of Ethereum.\n\nThis has sparked debates and discussions within the community and among investors regarding the potential implications for the value of Ethereum and its economic model.\n\nThe mechanics behind the burning of fees involves a system called EIP-1559, implemented in 2021, which introduced a base fee for transactions that is burned, along with a tip to miners, now validators, to prioritize transactions.\n\nThe Dencun update has changed these mechanisms, influencing the way commissions are calculated and thus reducing the overall amount burned.\n\nEconomic implications\n\nThe rationale behind reducing transaction fees is multifaceted. Part of the motivation is to lower transaction costs for users and make the network more attractive and competitive, especially against emerging rivals that offer cheaper and faster transactions. This is crucial in a blockchain ecosystem that is becoming increasingly crowded and competitive.\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the increased rate of ETH supply could have mixed implications. On one hand, if the supply grows too rapidly, it could exert downward pressure on the price of ETH, especially if demand does not keep pace.\n\nOn the other hand, lower transaction fees could lead to increased network usage, potentially increasing demand and offsetting some of the inflationary pressures.\n\nThe market\u2019s response to these changes has been cautiously optimistic. While some investors are concerned about the potential for increased inflation, others are encouraged by the increase in network activity and cost reduction. The full impact of these changes will unfold in the coming months as users and investors adjust to the new fee dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, the main developers of Ethereum are constantly working on further updates and improvements. The goal remains to improve scalability, security, and sustainability, which are crucial to maintain Ethereum\u2019s position as a leader in the blockchain space.\n\nIn conclusion, while the increase in Ethereum supply after Dencun presents new challenges, it also reflects the dynamic nature of the network and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nHow this will affect Ethereum\u2019s market position remains to be seen, but what is clear is that Ethereum continues to be at the forefront of blockchain innovation and evolution."

        "title": "Ethereum declines briefly, JP Morgan sees a spot ETH ETF approval despite recent Wells notice - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum spot ETFs will likely be approved despite recent Wells notices, says JP Morgan.\n\nInsights from Glassnode show that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin in terms of price performance since the recent bull cycle began.\n\nEthereum will likely continue trading in key range without a bearish macro event.\n\nEthereum (ETH) saw a sharp price decline on Friday following data revealing its underperformance compared to Bitcoin (BTC). Despite recent Wells notices to crypto firms, JP Morgan analysts predicted spot ETH ETFs would be approved.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum needs a bullish trigger, Joseph Lubin blasts the SEC\n\nDaily digest market movers: Active user growth, declining gas fees, underperforming Bitcoin\n\nIn a recent Ethereum-based report, JP Morgan said that the SEC's recent Wells notices to Robinhood Crypto, Consensys, and Uniswap don't pose a challenge to the agency's potential approval of a spot ETH ETF. Although analysts of the banking giants expressed doubt if the products would see approval this month, they noted that the market won't see it as a huge disappointment.\n\n\"Markets do not expect an approval by this month as implied by the significant discount to NAV by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE,\" they said.\n\nJP Morgan analysts also suggested the SEC may \"face a legal challenge and eventually lose\" if it denies applications for spot ETH ETFs, considering the agency already approved futures-based ETH ETFs.\n\nIn response, General Partner at Van Buren Capital Scott Johnsson expressed an opposite view, stating he would be surprised if a legal battle ensued following a potential spot ETH ETF denial. He mentioned that Grayscale hinted that it won't take the SEC to court this time after withdrawing a \"key tool\" \u2014 probably its application for futures ETH ETF. Johnsson also stated that a denial based on correlation arguments will be \"tough to appeal.\"\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Layer 2s are about to set a new all-time high in terms of active addresses, with more than 5.2 million monthly active users as of May 5, according to data posted by Leon Waidmann. Combined with monthly active users from the ETH Mainchain, the Ethereum ecosystem would have recorded nearly 7.6 million monthly active users \u2014 almost 5x active users in 2022.\n\nThe surge in user growth coincides with declining gas fees for Ethereum Layer 2s, which have been reduced more than tenfold since the Dencun upgrade in March, according to data from IntoTheBlock.\n\nMeanwhile, Glassnode data shows that Ethereum has underperformed in the last two years when compared to Bitcoin. This is seen in a low ETH/BTC ratio and ETH drawdown in this cycle (-44%), doubling Bitcoin's (-21%). The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) of Bitcoin \"crossed 0.5 and entered the euphoria phase three months before the equivalent metric for Ethereum,\" noted Glassnode.\n\nTypically, an NUPL greater than 0.5 means unrealized profit from investors is greater than half of an asset's market capitalization.\n\nRead more: Ethereum could experience bullish run, ETH \u2018ultrasound\u2019 money narrative at risk\n\nAnother key insight from Glassnode data shows that Ethereum is trading close to the purchasing cost of short-term holders (investors who bought the asset within the last 155 days). The short-term holder's cost basis often serves as a resistance during a bearish trend or support during a bullish trend\n\nWith the price of Ethereum close to the average STH cost level of $3,010, Glassnode has suggested that recent buyers may \"panic should the market experience downside volatility.\" Recent reported whale purchases around this price level align with Glassnode's STH cost basis.\n\nOne interesting part of Ethereum's on-chain activity Glassnode highlighted is that long-term holders within the past one to two years are still holding onto their positions in hopes of \"better profit-taking opportunities.\"\n\nETH technical analysis: ETH may continue trading in key range despite recent decline\n\nEthereum saw a price inefficiency on Friday, extending from $3,045 to $2,905. This was accompanied by a sharp liquidation of long positions, reaching $27 million within four hours.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum resume sideways move as Grayscale files to withdraw Ethereum futures ETF application with the SEC\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nThe move isn't a surprise as ETH has leaned toward the downside in the past few days despite uncertainty among traders. However, key predictions remain unchanged as ETH would likely remain trading within the $2,852 to $3,000 range.\n\nThe recent decline could present a buying opportunity for whales who have continued purchasing ETH around the $3,000 mark. Without any bearish macro event in sight, ETH would likely hold the range until the SEC decides on Van Ecks' spot ETH ETF application on May 23."

        "content": "Real Vision crypto analyst Jamie Coutts says that key indicators for one Ethereum (ETH) competitor are flashing bullish.\n\nThe former Bloomberg analyst tells his 14,100 followers on the social media platform X that NEAR Protocol (NEAR) could soar more than 47% from its current value.\n\n\u201cAbsolute price momentum: has been consolidating since March. The technical pattern looks extremely bullish if it breaks this resistance around $7.60 which is where a cluster of volume has traded these past months. This is a high conviction set up if it breaks the pattern neckline, producing a target above $10.50 (+30%).\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, the analyst suggests NEAR is printing an inverse head and shoulders pattern (I-HNS). An I-HNS is a bullish technical formation with the right shoulder suggesting bulls are willing to accumulate the asset without waiting for the price to drop to its previous low.\n\nThe analyst also predicts that NEAR\u2019s bullish trend against Bitcoin (NEAR/BTC) and Solana (NEAR/SOL) will continue.\n\n\u201cRelative price momentum: NEAR versus SOL and BTC are positive and ready to break higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, NEAR is also experiencing huge daily active user (DAU) growth on the network compared to other smart contract platforms, which is another bullish signal.\n\n\u201cAbsolute active user momentum: NEAR\u2019s Daily active users have grown from 50,000 to 1.76 million in the past year. Ex-NEAR that number has grown from 5.4 million to 8.75 million.\u201d\n\nHe says the user growth rate far exceeds the combined growth rate of the other layer-1 and layer-2 projects.\n\n\u201cRelative active user momentum: that\u2019s growth of 33x vs 0.6x for the rest of the L1/L2 ecosystem.\u201d\n\nNEAR is trading for $7.14 at time of writing, down 3.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "The average transaction fee on Ethereum has reached record lows as more activity moves to the Layer-2 (L2) networks on the chain.\n\nAccording to Ultrasound.money data, the average gas has dropped to 4.81 Gwei \u2014 the lowest level since the network completed the Merge event in 2022.\n\nMarket observers attributed this decline to increasing activity on L2 networks following the completion of the Dencun upgrade. The Dencun upgrade significantly reduced fees for L2 networks, making transacting on the base layer less attractive.\n\nNotably, the blockchain analytical platform IntoTheBlock reported:\n\n\u201cAn increasing number of transactions are now being settled on Ethereum Layer 2s. Last month, the three largest L2s hit a record 82% transaction share of all Ethereum transactions.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the number of transactions on Arbitrum has seen strong growth, reaching over 2 million daily transactions on May 8 \u2014 a significant rise from the early March average of 1 million.\n\nL2beats data further indicates that Base and Arbitrum averaged 30 and 20 transactions per second, respectively, while Ethereum managed 13 transactions per second during the same period.\n\nETH turns inflationary\n\nMeanwhile, CryptoQuant analysis revealed that ETH has transitioned to an inflationary state post the Dencun upgrade, resulting in diminished gas fees and reducing its burn rate.\n\nIn light of this development, the firm noted:\n\n\u201cSince The Merge, Ethereum appeared to be on track with its \u2018ultra-sound\u2019 money narrative, showing a slight reduction in the total ETH supply. However, the post-Dencun upgrade challenges this by reducing transaction fees and the ETH burn rate, leading to an increase in supply.\u201d\n\nCryptoQuant further elaborated that the Dencun upgrade environment has presented a scenario where maintaining deflation would require a substantial increase in network activity, contrasting the current trend of low gas fees and reduced burn rates.\n\nNotably, UltraSound.Money data shows that the daily amount of ETH burned during the past day was 519 ETH, a record low for the network."

        "title": "Vitalik Buterin has a new proposal to make Ethereum wallets easier to use \u2014 but obstacles remain - DLNews",
        "content": "New new proposal from Vitalik Buterin could help speed up Account Abstraction adoption.\n\nAccount Abstraction promises to make Ethereum more intuitive and safer to use.\n\nThe update could come as soon as the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nDeFi on Ethereum is often clunky and unintuitive, with few safeguards for new entrants.\n\nOne highly anticipated improvement is Account Abstraction \u2014 a new way for Ethereum wallets to handle transactions.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a hitch.\n\nAccount Abstraction is incompatible with existing wallets, which is slowing its adoption.\n\nA recent proposal from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin may change that. Called EIP-7702, the proposal creates a route for existing wallets to use Account Abstraction \u2014 which was previously difficult to achieve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a very early proposal, so we need to evaluate all the rough edges,\u201d Ethereum core developer Marius van der Wijden told DL News.\n\nEIP-7702 adds a new transaction type that allows existing wallets to emulate the functions of Account Abstraction wallets, Van der Wijden said.\n\nIf successful, the proposal will unlock new transaction types, prevent users from losing access to their funds through email recovery, and even facilitate new use cases for the top smart contract network.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nVan der Wijden said EIP-7702 will probably be included in Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade \u2014 dubbed Pectra \u2014 scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nA step closer to adoption\n\nAccount Abstraction has been around for a while.\n\nIn March 2023, a previous update introduced an Ethereum feature called ERC-4337, which allowed developers to start building Account Abstraction wallets.\n\nA lack of support for Account Abstraction, coupled with no easy way for users to switch over to the new wallet type, has slowed adoption.\n\nAt the same time, another proposal, called EIP-3074, introduced a change that would allow those with non-Account Abstraction wallets to delegate their control to smart contracts, allowing users to access Account Abstraction features.\n\nWhile EIP-3074 could aid Account Abstraction adoption, many developers criticised it because it puts users\u2019 funds at increased risk.\n\nThe answer may be Buterin\u2019s EIP-7702 proposal.\n\nEIP-7702 aligns the two previous routes to Account Abstraction \u2014 EIP-3074 and ERC-4337 \u2014 into \u201cone unified Account Abstraction roadmap,\u201d Alex Jupiter, a senior product manager at MetaMask, told DL News.\n\nThe result is a streamlined way for existing wallets to use all the features of Account Abstraction without the risks of EIP-3074.\n\nNew transaction types\n\nOn the surface, Account Abstraction wallets function the same as existing wallets. But under the hood, they have the ability to use smart contracts to manage funds, allowing for a host of new features that could help increase DeFi adoption.\n\nThe most obvious improvement is the ability to program transactions, allowing blockchains to replicate services banks and other money-transmitting services offer, such as scheduling payments.\n\nPayments provider Visa has previously highlighted the potential of Account Abstraction for automatic payments.\n\nThe ability to sponsor transactions is another appealing feature that Account Abstraction unlocks. Sponsoring transactions means allowing another party \u2014 such as a wallet provider, DeFi protocol, or blockchain \u2014 to pay for a user\u2019s transaction fees.\n\nProgramming transactions can also help make using DeFi on Ethereum more intuitive.\n\nCurrently, when users want to swap tokens on a decentralised exchange, or send tokens to a different blockchain via a crypto bridge, they must sign multiple transactions at different stages of the process.\n\nWith Account Abstraction, everything can be bundled into a single transaction, allowing for a smoother experience.\n\nLost your private key? Don\u2019t worry\n\nAccount Abstraction should also make using DeFi safer.\n\nWhen a user creates an Ethereum wallet they receive a private key, usually abstracted to a sequence of words called a recovery phrase.\n\nThis key is the only way a user can access their funds. If the key is lost, stolen, or if a user\u2019s wallet is accidentally uninstalled or the wallet account is deleted, the funds it controls could be lost forever.\n\nWith Account Abstraction, it is possible to implement a recovery process in which a user can designate multiple trusted individuals as recovery agents. This can consist of an email address or other forms of identification, such as Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication.\n\nThe process is similar to creating and securing an account in the web2 world, but it is executed through a decentralised network.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn an acerbic X post, Ethereum (ETH) veteran, prominent investor, podcaster and crypto educator Ryan Sean Adams describes two alternative midterm forecasts for Ether (ETH) as a crypto coin.\n\nBearish: Inevitable puberty of Ethereum (ETH)\n\nIn a 2024-2025 potential rally, Ethereum (ETH) might be overlooked by investors as it is going through the \"awkward\" phase of \"puberty.\" It looks too slow and expensive compared to its own second-layer solutions of various types, Adams admits.\n\nWhile L2s are necessary for the scaling of such a blockchain and reflect the founder's vision of its progress, it has nothing to do with the interests of its most obvious investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeme coin champions and dApps users (including retroactive airdrop farmers) are too focused on alternative L2/L3 blockchains, while institutional \"big money\" is on its way to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe approval of Spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. might change the status quo but, as U.Today previously reported, analysts are skeptical of the possibility of this step in the coming months.\n\nAs such, Ethereum (ETH) is getting through the challenges of its \"puberty\" while \"toddler chains\" are looking for shortcuts and, therefore, might look more attractive in the midterm.\n\nBullish: Rock solid monetary economics for \"chain of 1000 chains\"\n\nAt the same time, the arguments of Ethereum (ETH) optimists also look strong as of Q2, 2024. Ethereum (ETH) meets this cycle stronger than in 2020 with viable overhyped L2s and zkEVMs driving innovations and attracting value.\n\nWith its \"rock solid monetary economics\" cemented by ERC 4337 implementation, it remains the only profitable blockchain, and its competitors are not even close to this status.\n\nAlso, despite the growing audience of alternative blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) mainnet remains the root chain for 1,000 blockchains, Adams says.\n\nThese two theses are just \"two perspectives for ETH bulls,\" the author concludes.\n\nEther (ETH) is changing hands at $2,925, being 3% down in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLate Saturday, an Ethereum layer-2 network called Linea found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nUsing an exploit, attackers had drained $2.3 million worth of ETH from a decentralized exchange that operates on Linea, called Velocore. Unable to reach the Velocore team, Linea\u2019s leadership made the decisive call to freeze all transactions across the network in an effort to prevent further malfeasance. The plan worked: Linea users were insulated from additional losses.\n\nThat\u2019s when the trouble started.\n\nCrypto users immediately decried Linea\u2019s actions across social media, arguing that the company had violated the industry\u2019s core principle, decentralization. If a few people could halt Linea in their pajamas, then how could the network be considered any better than Wells Fargo?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm done with this crap. It's 2024, and L2s are still spewing the same bullshit about their core values being \"permissionless\" and \"censorship-resistant\" after being live for over a year but are still running centralised sequencers. Give me a break. They act all high and mighty,\u2026 https://t.co/MykDJ9G3IF \u2014 sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / (@pcaversaccio) June 2, 2024\n\nLinea immediately pivoted, posting on Twitter that the network was still in the \u201ctraining wheels\u201d phase of decentralization, but that it planned to eventually transition to a completely trustless structure. (Disclosure: Linea is owned by Consensys, which is one of 22 investors in Decrypt).\n\nConsensys' L2 unilaterally turned off the chain yesterday Reasonable given the circumstances but also a clear sign that this is not crypto pic.twitter.com/q8VaaEFOpN \u2014 mert | helius | hSOL (@0xMert_) June 2, 2024\n\nThe incident laid bare a contradiction, some developers say, that doesn\u2019t only pertain to just one blockchain. Rather, it exposed flaws in the entire, burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem\u2014a collection of privately owned networks that has been frequently touted as Ethereum\u2019s path forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo you're saying you intervened on behalf of users here, but in the future, hopefully, if you work really hard, you won\u2019t be able to intervene and your users will lose all their money?\u201d Tom Lehman, the co-founder of several Ethereum projects including layer-1 alternative Facet and Ethscriptions, told Decrypt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nTo Lehman, the contradictions exposed by Linea\u2019s public relations woes this week are not isolated\u2014they are endemic to layer-2 networks.\n\n\u201cHaving a layer-2 that's centrally controlled is not a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that every single one of them being centrally controlled is a problem.\u201d\n\nNearly all major scaling networks\u2014like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and Polygon\u2014were created by private, for-profit companies. Most rely on sequencers, controlled by the network\u2019s team, which batch transactions together and submit them to the Ethereum mainnet. In such cases, like Linea\u2019s, project teams have the power to effectively shut off a network by halting said sequencers.\n\nWhy do most layer-2s exert such centralized control over their transactions? Linea, which did not respond to Decrypt\u2019s questions by the time of publication, claimed in statements this week that the issue is a technical one that requires long-term finesse.\n\nBut financial incentives may also be at play. By controlling that single choke point through which all transactions must pass, layer-2 teams also control the profits derived from processing every network transaction. Such fees are the lifeblood of layer-2s, which often employ dozens of people, and such Ethereum networks are collectively raking in millions of dollars in monthly, on-chain profit.\n\n\u201cL2s can be very profitable to run,\u201d Lehman said. \u201cBut that profit is tied to how much control you have.\u201d\n\nSome layer-2 teams say they are ahead of the pack, and have taken distinct steps towards decentralization. Arbitrum, for example, features a backup pathway that allows users to post their transactions to Ethereum directly, in case any issues emerge within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Submitting transactions via this delayed inbox is not ideal, however, and can take up to 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteven Goldfeder, the CEO of Arbitrum core developer Offchain Labs, told Decrypt that the company is currently working to decentralize its sequencer\u2014but made a point of arguing that it poses less of a centralization threat than other layer-2s, given that the Arbitrum Foundation could not single-handedly prevent users from posting transactions.\n\n\u201cOn Arbitrum, the problem is a lot smaller than on other networks,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\nGoldfeder welcomes vocal criticism of centralization risks in the layer-2 ecosystem. He believes such dissent applies crucial pressure to companies that otherwise might focus on different priorities.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, you have the wrong incentives: growth first, and decentralization at some point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we just take one centralized system and replace it with another centralized system with a vague claim of eventually decentralizing\u2014often without technical details\u2014then I think it's very dangerous.\u201d\n\nSome developers like Arjun Bhuptani, the founder of inter-blockchain bridge Everclear, however, feel that even Arbitrum\u2019s solution to current centralization issues on layer-2s is insufficient.\n\n\u201cIt is better, but is still not \u2018censorship resistance,\u2019\u201d he told Decrypt of Arbitrum.\n\nFurther, Arbitrum itself has suffered network-wide outages repeatedly in the last year.\n\nTo Bhuptani, the issue of centralization is so pervasive on layer-2s simply because the privately owned networks are currently facing other, greater concerns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt largely just comes down to prioritization,\u201d he said. \u201cProjects are seeing bigger threats to their survival today on other axes than censorship, and so building decentralization is lower priority than things like security, custody risk, and market traction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the matter of censorship on layer-2 networks is still largely theoretical. The Linea team, for example, has never used its power to block transactions on behalf of a sovereign government.\n\nBut such a scenario is by no means fanciful. The U.S. government has blacklisted Ethereum wallet addresses on multiple occasions. Centralized crypto exchanges have cooperated with the Israeli government to ban flagged accounts. Just last month, a Dutch court sentenced a developer of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum coin mixer designed to keep transactions private, to over five years in prison.\n\nEven those within the layer-2 ecosystem worry about what might happen if the private teams behind so many networks\u2014which, thanks to their incredibly low transaction fees, have recently been positioned as the best way to securely onboard the masses to crypto\u2014are legally compelled to do the bidding of governments across the world.\n\n\u201cSomething that I might think is legitimate,\u201d Goldfeder said, \u201csome oppressive regime somewhere might think is illegitimate behavior that should be censored.\u201d\n\nSome Ethereum developers feel, however, that the whole debate this week about Linea and crypto\u2019s future has been blown out of proportion.\n\n\u201cIt's easy for people who were not affected by hacks to complain,\u201d Joseph Schiarizzi, developer of Arbitrum-based stablecoin OpenDollar, told Decrypt. \u201cBut if you've ever been a victim, you understand the Linea team made the right move.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not expect every piece of infrastructure to be decentralized,\u201d he continued. \u201cI care much more about honesty and transparency, which Linea was great on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLehman, who is currently developing a more decentralized alternative to networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, said he doesn\u2019t want to demonize layer-2 networks or dismiss their usefulness. He only worries about crypto\u2019s future if they become omnipresent.\n\n\u201cThe problem comes when you say \u2018L2s are the future, that's how we scale, that's it,\u2019\u201d Lehman said. \u201cAnd in the process, [you] hand over the keys to giant billion-dollar entities and endorse them running insecure systems.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum could use a much better system for charging transaction fees from its users, the network's chief architect Vitalik Buterin argued in a widely circulated essay published Thursday.\n\nButerin's post, which laid out a path toward a more customized and equitable system, immediately garnered reactions from two principal groups: Ethereum users, who expressed their excitement at the prospect of lower fees on the network\u2019s costly mainnet; and Solana users and developers, who noticed that Buterin's proposal sounded an awful lot like the Solana network's own fee model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a Solana-esque approach,\u201d Mert Mumtaz, a prominent Solana builder and the co-founder and CEO of infrastructure startup Helius Labs, told Decrypt.\n\nSo just how similar is Buterin\u2019s \u201cmultidimensional gas fees\u201d proposal to Solana's \"local fee markets\"?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGas fees refer to the transaction costs that blockchain users pay to the network. This system is in many ways what gives tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) their value. You need ETH to pay gas if you want to do just about anything on the Ethereum network, just like you need SOL to do things on Solana. When there's a lot of activity on the network, gas fees go up. And when there's less activity, gas fees go down.\n\nIn some ways, Solana's current gas fee structure and Vitalik's \u201cmultidimensional gas fees\u201d proposal stem from the same philosophy: In the name of fairness, different types of on-chain transactions should cost different amounts, depending on demand. But in practice, leaders of both networks appear to have different ideas about how to implement such a philosophy\u2014leading to a potentially significant difference in user experience.\n\nSolana currently operates on a \u201clocal fee markets\u201d structure, wherein gas fees are calculated on a per-account basis, project by project. In this system, spikes in gas fees due to network congestion are effectively quarantined to specific projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, a spike in gas fees induced by a hot Solana NFT mint should only impact users who are interacting with that project\u2014users elsewhere across the entire Solana network should be unaffected. (There is currently some disagreement within the Solana community about whether local fee markets actually work as effectively as intended, in part due to the hyper-congestion that can occur in crowded mini-gas ecosystems.)\n\nBut Solana\u2019s setup makes a clear contrast to Ethereum\u2014where demand for wildly popular NFTs has previously clogged the entire network, sending gas fees skyrocketing for everyone.\n\nEthereum is in its Solana era https://t.co/hGfLU3zqPP \u2014 Alex Kroeger (@alex_kroeger) May 9, 2024\n\ndid he just copy this off solana \u2014 willo (@willo_0x) May 9, 2024\n\nEthereum \ud83e\udd1d Solana \u2014 Sam Ragsdale (@samrags_) May 9, 2024\n\nThe \u201cmultidimensional gas fees\u201d concept proposed by Vitalik Buterin does seek to make Ethereum transaction costs more equitable. But it doesn't appear to outline a boutique system like Solana\u2019s, in which every individual project on Ethereum would become its own siloed gas ecosystem.\n\nInstead, multidimensional gas on Ethereum would only distinguish between different macro categories of effort required to complete network transactions, Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. For example, computation, storage, and calldata might fetch different premiums at a given moment, depending on demand. Different on-chain transactions consist of different ratios of those categories of computing.\n\nPer Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, which went live in March, constituted the debut of such a system by sending layer-2 data, the sort that comes from layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, to \u201cblobs.\u201d Blobs feature different prices and different limits than the rest of an Ethereum block.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt a macro level, expanding multidimensional gas to differentiate between more computational categories might improve Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, and in Buterin's view, significantly increase scalability of the network\u2019s mainnet.\n\nBut it likely wouldn't insulate Ethereum users from spikes in network volatility induced by trending projects\u2014it\u2019s not that boutique in design.\n\nSo, all that is to say: Solana and Ethereum maximalists, fear not. There will still be plenty of differences to pick apart.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
