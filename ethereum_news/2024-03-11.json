        "title": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Hard-Fork Strategy to Protect Ethereum From Quantum Attacks - The Quantum Insider",
        "content": "Insider Brief\n\nEthereum co-founder floats a hard fork strategy to safeguard Ethereum funds against potential quantum computer attacks.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s strategy involves a series of measures designed to fortify Ethereum\u2019s defenses.\n\nSome community members have voiced concerns over the efficacy of such measures if quantum computers capable of decrypting Ethereum wallet.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a hard fork strategy aimed at safeguarding Ethereum funds against potential quantum computer attacks. This proposal has ignited a widespread discussion on the necessity of quantum security measures within the blockchain ecosystem, as reported by Blockchain.News.\n\nButerin\u2019s proposed strategy involves a series of measures designed to fortify Ethereum\u2019s defenses in the event of a quantum computing breach.\n\nA quantum computer\u2019s theoretical ability to solve certain mathematical problems far more efficiently than classical computers are the cause for concern. These cryptographic techniques serve as much of blockchain\u2019s security. Quantum computers could \u2014 again, theoretically \u2014 undermine Ethereum\u2019s cryptographic bedrock by decrypting private keys and compromising the integrity of smart contracts. This quantum capability could also disrupt consensus mechanisms, centralizing control or threatening the security of staked assets, which would Ethereum\u2019s long-term viability and undermining trust in the platform.\n\nKey Steps\n\nKey steps were discussed in the Ethereum Research forum. The steps include the reversion of all blocks subsequent to the detection of a quantum attack, the suspension of traditional externally owned account (EOA) transactions to prevent further vulnerabilities, and the introduction of a new transaction type tailored for smart contract wallets that aligns with the anticipated RIP-7560 standard.\n\nThe proposal also outlines the implementation of an innovative transaction type or opcode that would enable users to submit STARK proofs. These proofs verify the user\u2019s knowledge of a private preimage and a public address generated through approved hash functions, culminating in the replacement of the user\u2019s account code with a quantum-resistant validation mechanism.\n\nAmong these deliberations, the web site reported that some community members voiced concerns that these measures would not be effective if people with malevolent intentions secure quantum computers capable of decrypting Ethereum wallets. These skeptics argue that distinguishing between legitimate owners and attackers could be extremely difficult under such circumstances. They advocate for the adoption of NIST standardized algorithms in a hybrid configuration with classical algorithms, such as combining the Dilithium and ed25519 algorithms, despite the resultant increase in block sizes due to the high number of signature and public key sizes of many current post-quantum schemes.\n\nAlternative propositions include the development of machine learning systems dedicated to the surveillance and identification of anomalous transactions, serving as an early warning mechanism to activate a fail-safe fork.\n\nThe Ethereum community\u2019s engagement with these quantum security challenges underscores the sector\u2019s proactive stance in navigating the security arms race posed by quantum computing advancements. Innovations such as Lamport signatures and ERC 4337-based quantum-resistant smart contract wallets, along with the integration of quantum-safe cryptographic solutions in digital signature applications, epitomize the blockchain sector\u2019s commitment to resilience and adaptability in the face of technological threats.\n\nIf you found this article to be informative, you can explore more current quantum news here, exclusives, interviews, and podcasts."

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Resistance at $4K, Yet Current Data Favours Bulls - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Ethereum Faces Resistance at $4K, Yet Current Data Favours Bulls\n\nEthereum has become a symbol of innovation in the blockchain space attracting many innovators to develop their crypto projects on it. As a result, there are many decentralized applications on the blockchain.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is the second largest blockchain and the biggest altcoin project. That is a reason why the crypto market anticipates the United States SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs in the near future. This analysis will cover the recent ETH price movement and its future catalysts.\n\nETH Recent Gains Tied to Decreasing Supply and Staking Demand, DeFi Popularity and Proof \u2013 of \u2013 stake Burn Mechanism\n\nOn February 25th Ethereum broke above the $3,000 price level, a critical resistance zone, and has moved steadily up since. On the 11th of March ETH hit $4000, before sliding back slightly on the 12th. Current data suggests that ETH has the potential to trend above the $4,000 level and possibly enter a major bull run.\n\n\n\nConfidence that the ETH price will surpass the $4,000 level and enter an ETH bull run is drawn from several factors including the decrease in Ethereum supply, being driven by the demand for staking. The ETH supply may shrink as a result of the network\u2019s proof-of-stake burn mechanism. Once ETH rises above $4,000 it may get strong resistance at $4,065, $4,185, $4,220, and then $4,300.\n\n\n\nMany ETH enthusiasts anticipate that an Ethereum season will come in the near future. As a result, some Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH anticipating a higher price at the right time, considering that there are several expected upgrades on the blockchain that may increase the coin\u2019s demand.\n\nAs the screenshot indicates, Ryan S Adams, a crypto analyst and enthusiast, expects the ETH demand and price to rise as a result of staking and restaking of the coin. The expansion of the DeFi ecosystem based on the Ethereum network will also likely increase the demand for ETH which may contribute to a possible Ethereum price surge. Once the Ethereum price surges above $4,000 the market anticipates it will break above the $4,300 resistance level, positioning itself for the next Ether bull run.\n\nEthereum Price Catalysts as we Move Beyond the Dencun Upgrade\n\nThere are several factors that are likely to affect the Ethereum price in 2024, including an increase in staking, the Dencun Upgrade, ETH ETFs and a decrease in its supply. The Bitcoin halving may also affect the ETH price due to their correlation.\n\nDecrease in Ethereum Supply: During a 30-day period that ended on 24 February the Ethereum circulating supply decreased by 18,960 ETH while beginning from 15 February there has been a preference for net withdrawals. The next diagram gives a summary of Net ETH transfers to exchanges, indicating a rise in selling pressure.\n\nUsually, the net transfers to exchanges increase when the Ethereum holders aim to sell their coins. Nonetheless, the fact that the Ether price remained stable around $2,300 indicates that the rise in Ethereum sales was not related to a price rally.\n\nThe SEC Approval of Spot ETH ETFs May Trigger An Ethereum Price Surge: We have noted that the SEC\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF approval in January has increased the demand for bitcoin. For example, the BTC ETF issuers like BlackRock have acquired much bitcoin in a short period. The market anticipates a similar effect on the demand for ETH if the SEC approves the ETFs.\n\nThe approval of the spot ETH ETFs will likely trigger an Ethereum price rally and a possible ETH bull run. Currently, many crypto analysts have said that there is a 50% chance of SEC approval of the ETFs. For example, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an investment analyst at JPMorgan, told TheBlock that there is a 50% possibility of the SEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETFs. The earliest expected date for the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is 23 May.\n\nIncrease in Ethereum Future Premium: The market usually uses changes in the price of ETH futures to gauge ETH\u2019s possible future trend. In a neutral ETH market the Ethereum futures often trade at a premium of between 5% and 10%. Significantly, a premium of more than 10% shows that the demand for the coin may increase or remain high which influences the price of the underlying asset to rise. However, in the case of Ethereum the premium is stuck above 14% indicating a high demand for ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade: A number of upgrades lined up for the Ethereum blockchain like the recent Dencun one may also push the ETH price up. Dencun, the Ethereum protocol upgrade, launched on 13 March, and will bring significant benefits to the blockchain such as the reduction in transaction fees.\n\nRise in Decentralized Finance on Ethereum: Several crypto projects have launched decentralized finance protocols on the Ethereum blockchain which may increase the demand for ETH. For instance, there has been a rise in liquid staking tokens (LRTs) on the blockchain. Ether.FI and Puffer are examples of DeFi platforms that have introduced high-yield liquid staking tokens (LRTs). Interestingly, some of the recently introduced DeFi protocols have been offering airdrops to the Ethereum community. As an example, Starknet, an Ethereum rollup, recently introduced STRK airdrop which has helped to increase the demand for ETH. These factors, among others, may help drive Ethereum season.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s all time high was $4706 \u2013 achieved in November 2021. Currently, the $4,000 Ethereum price level is providing some resistance forcing the value of ETH to remain below it for now. Nonetheless, there are various factors that can help to catapult the price of ETH higher. The decrease in its circulating supply, ETH restaking, the Dencun upgrade and the rise in DeFi on the Ethereum blockchain may lead to an increase in the value of the coin \u2013 and a potential new all time high in the coming months."

        "content": "Ethereum has a four-in-five chance of hitting a new record high in 2024, according to bettors on Polymarket.\n\nAt the same time, analysts and online punters\u2019 hopes for an Ethereum ETF approval are dwindling.\n\nSo what\u2019s driving the surge?\n\nOnline punters put the odds of Ethereum breaking a record this year at 79%, according to a bet on crypto predictions platform Polymarket. That\u2019s up from 31% in mid-February.\n\nYet bettors and analysts are putting slim chances of a Securities and Exchange Commission approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe deadline for an SEC decision on VanEck\u2019s application is on May 23.\n\nBettors on Polymarket give a spot Ethereum ETF a 31% chance of being approved, down from 82% at the beginning of January.\n\n\u201cI get all the reasons they should approve it \u2014 and we personally believe they should \u2014 but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish [two and a half months] out for Bitcoin spot are not there this time,\u201d Eric Balchunas said in a post on X.\n\nHe and his fellow Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart revised their approval odds to 35% on Monday, down from 70% in February.\n\nThe hope is that if and when spot Ethereum ETFs are approved, they will give the asset a similar growth as Bitcoin had on the back of ETFs in January.\n\nThe news comes as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $71,000 on Monday, with many wondering if Ethereum will follow suit.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEthereum surged to a yearly high above $4,070 on Monday and is up more than 60% over the last 30 days.\n\nEthereum reached a record $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nAnalysts have identified several key factors that could super-charge it to new peaks.\n\nThey include broad optimism, supply-side dynamics, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nSupply constraints\n\nAnother Ethereum tailwind: its shrinking supply due to tokens being locked up for staking, Pratik Kala, senior digital asset investment analyst at crypto fund manager DigitalX, told DL News on Monday.\n\n\u201cLess supply to go around is always bullish,\u201d Pratik said. \u201cThis also indicates strong long-term investor demand to buy/hold/stake ETH versus using it for short-term speculation.\u201d\n\nStaking in Ethereum parallels Bitcoin mining by generating additional tokens, verifying transactions, and safeguarding the blockchain.\n\nLocking up tokens for staking effectively means removed them from the circulating supply, which can lead to a decrease in the overall available supply.\n\nRoughly 26% of Ethereum\u2019s estimated circulating supply of more than 120 million tokens are locked away, according to blockchain explorer beaconcha.in.\n\nDencun upgrade\n\nInvestment bank JPMorgan and spot Bitcoin ETF provider Grayscale are among those that have identified the Dencun upgrade as a catalyst for Ethereum.\n\nThe upgrade, due Wednesday UK time, is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 platforms.\n\n\u201cWith layer 2 solutions built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain is becoming the settlement layer for a whole new digital infrastructure encompassing gaming, trading, and investing,\u201d Eugene Cheung, Bybit\u2019s head of institutions, told DL News earlier in March.\n\n\u201cThe value of all of this will tend to accrue to the ETH asset.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous headline misstated the Polymarket odds of an Ethereum record at 56%. It has been corrected to 79%.\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com."

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Triple Halving? - LCX",
        "content": "The Ethereum Merge upgrades, which marked the transition from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) paradigm, are a significant turning point in the development of Ethereum. The aforementioned transition has led to the emergence of the phrase \u2018Ethereum Triple Halving,\u2019 which has piqued the interest of traders, investors, and industry professionals who are anxious to comprehend its possible ramifications on ETH transaction fees and prices.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Triple Halving\n\nThe Ethereum Triple Halving refers to a procedure wherein the block incentive for ETH is decreased from three (3) ETH to one (1) ETH per block. This decrease in frequency takes place around every four to six years and functions to mitigate inflationary pressures on the Ethereum network, ultimately contributing to the augmentation of the ETH\u2019s long-term value.\n\nThe moniker \u201cTriple Halving\u201d is derived from the Bitcoin halving phenomenon, which entails a halving of mining rewards for Bitcoin every four years. Although conceptually similar, the Triple Halving implemented on Ethereum transpires on a significantly grander magnitude. This is accomplished through the reduction of rewards that miners obtain for each successful validation of a transaction block. When new currencies are minted, Ethereum miners are awarded tokens, similar to how Bitcoin is halved. In addition, transaction fees are allocated to miners in recognition of each block that is mined effectively on Ethereum.\n\nBriefly, the event is referred to as the \u201cEthereum Triple Halving\u201d because of the following:\n\nAt the moment, the default fee percentage stands at 12.5%, which signifies that 12.5% of the petrol fees are incinerated. However, there are intentions to increase this to 25% by means of the forthcoming Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, which is scheduled for March 2023.\n\nAdditionally, an imminent enhancement known as Surge is anticipated to be implemented. As a result, the basic fee percentage will once more increase to 50%.\n\nThese two enhancements will collectively reduce the rate of new Ether issuance by approximately 90%, which is equivalent to three consecutive halvings. This contributes to the term \u201ctriple halving\u201d being applied."

However, the exact date has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAccording to the LSE's Crypto ETN Admission Factsheet, eligible ETNs must be physically backed and non-leveraged. They must also be backed by Bitcoin or Ether and have a market price or value measure of the underlying asset that is publicly available.\n\nThe underlying crypto assets must be held in a cold wallet or similar storage solution, including cold staking, and by a custodian subject to Anti-Money Laundering laws in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland, or the United States.\n\nETNs are debt securities that provide exposure to an underlying asset. They allow investors to trade securities that track the performance of crypto assets during the exchange's trading hours.\n\nThe U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has stated that it will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a market segment for crypto-backed ETNs.\n\nHowever, these products can only be offered to \"professional investors,\" such as credit institutions and investment firms. However, it will not be available to retail investors, with the statement saying:\n\n\u201cThe FCA continues to believe cETNs and crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. As a result, the ban on the sale of cETNs (and crypto derivatives) to retail consumers remains in place.\u201d\n\nThe FCA has also emphasized that cryptocurrencies are still deemed \u201chigh risk and largely unregulated,\u201d and warns the public that their investments could go to zero. The UK government has recently ramped up regulatory efforts in the crypto industry, including allowing law enforcement to seize crypto assets suspected of being involved in illicit activities without a conviction."

        "content": "Robert Greer, author of What is an asset class anyway?, argues assets that lack an objective measure of value and have a supply constraint are more vulnerable to irrational exuberance, citing the \u2018dot-com\u2019 bubble as an example.\n\nCrypto assets lack an objective measure of value today among investors, similar to emerging tech companies in the late 1990s.\n\nWe can value any asset using two approaches \u2013 intrinsic or relative. Intrinsic valuation measures an asset\u2019s value based on its capacity to generate cash flows.\n\nOn the other hand, relative valuation methods, also called \u201cpricing\u201d, estimate how much to pay for an asset based on what others are paying for comparable ones.\n\nInvestors might use a discounted cash flow method (DCF) to value a stock, but they would not use that for a piece of fine art.\n\nSimilarly, we must outline the various types of crypto assets to understand the differences we may expect in their value accrual and specific valuation approaches.\n\nIn this regard, it is helpful to categorise crypto assets according to the three asset superclasses proposed by Robert Greer:\n\nCapital assets: \u201cAn ongoing source of something of value\u201d (e.g., bonds and stocks). Consumable/transformable assets: \u201cYou can consume it. You can transform it into another asset. It has economic value. But it does not yield an ongoing stream of value\u201d (e.g., physical commodities). Store of value assets: \u201cThey cannot be consumed, nor can they generate income. Yet they do have value\u201d (e.g., currencies and collectibles).\n\nLike the internet architecture, cryptoassets and blockchain technology have two layers: (1) infrastructure and (2) applications.\n\nIn his 2019 work, Chris Burniske categorised crypto assets at the infrastructure layer based on the consensus mechanism of the blockchain:\n\nProof-of-Work (PoW): In PoW networks like bitcoin, the native asset (BTC) relies on a computationally and energy-intensive lottery called mining to determine which block of transactions to settle on the blockchain and reward the miners. Hence, they belong to the consumable/transformable asset superclass, as they essentially create \u201ca digital-native commodity in the form of secure, globally accessible ledger space\u201d. Investors can use the mining cost of production as a fundamental metric to gauge the lower-bound price of PoW crypto assets like BTC. Proof-of-Stake (PoS): In networks like ethereum and solana, validators must commit a portion of their capital \u2013 the \u201cstake\u201d, in this case, ETH \u2013 to gain access to a recurring value stream generated by the network\u2019s rules. Hence, they fall in the capital asset category, and their value may be derived from the net present value of annual flows to validators using a DCF method.\n\nWhile we will not delve too deeply into the application layer, we can apply the same first-principles thinking:\n\nGovernance tokens yield voting rights and represent ownership of the application. They are analogous to common stock in traditional finance, so they fall in the capital asset class. Utility tokens drive the economics of the system as their sole function, meaning they fall in the Consumable Asset category. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are collectibles like fine art in their most typical form today, falling in the Store of Value category.\n\nIntrinsic valuation: Ethereum\n\nFrom the standpoint of a validator, PoS assets like ETH are akin to a stock paying a dividend yield, which means we can conduct a DCF valuation following four simple steps:\n\n1. Estimate the cash flows during the life of the crypto asset\n\na. Transaction fees within the network accrue to validators. Just so, fees are a proxy for revenue. Ethereum validators received $401.7m in transaction fees (net after the burn mechanism) from 28 January 2023 to 28 January.\n\nb. Token issuance does not dilute the value of validators. On the contrary, they have the right to new issuance, similar to how shareholders may receive stock-based compensation. ETH Issuance from January 28 2023, to January 28, 2024, amounted to $1.5bn.\n\nc. Total cash clows: a + b = ~$1.9bn in the first year.\n\n2. Estimate expected future cash flows and the lifespan of the crypto asset\n\na. Future cash flows: We propose a slight variation of the three-stage growth model to project ethereum\u2019s future cash flows. Specifically, we forecast an initial period of aggressive growth, followed by an incremental decrease that eventually stabilises at a more moderate growth rate.\n\nb. Lifespan of the asset: With public companies that at least in theory can last forever, equity analysts generally assume that cash flows beyond a specific point in time continue in perpetuity. Investors may apply the same logic to PoS crypto assets, but for simplicity\u2019s sake, we assume ETH\u2019s life will be 20 years.\n\n3. Estimate the discount rate to apply to these cash flows\n\na. Lower-bound discount rate (9.9%): In the past 10 years, the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF obtained a 9.90% compound annual return.\n\nb. Higher-bound discount rate (21.9%): Obtained using the Fama and French Three-Factor Model (market premium, size premium and value premium).\n\n4. Estimate the net present value (NPV) of cash flows using the above parameters\n\nAssuming a discount rate of 9.09%, the implied price per one ETH today would be ~$5,315, a 134% increase from ETH\u2019s price ($2,268) as of January 28, 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, if we use a 21.90% discount rate, the implied price per one ETH would be **$1,349**, a ~41% decrease from ETH\u2019s price, as of 28 January.\n\nInvestors should interpret the results of this DCF valuation with caution and run their own assumptions regarding projected cash flows and discount rates.\n\nThe rationale behind our approach was to be conservative and capture the high volatility of ETH in the discount rate to accurately reflect the asset\u2019s riskiness.\n\nAnother implicit assumption of this approach is that the asset\u2019s monetary premium (Store of Value) is embedded into the DCF.\n\nSource: https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/bitcoin-new-asset-class\n\nIntrinsic valuation: Bitcoin\n\nWhen it comes to crypto-commodities, the marginal cost of production is vital as it sets the price floor at which producers (miners) are willing to sell. From the outset, it is crucial to emphasise that we are not suggesting that the price of BTC should be determined by its marginal cost of production.\n\nTo do so would be to adopt a labour theory of value, which is ostensibly false. Instead, the marginal cost of production is a tool that can help investors estimate a lower bound price level for BTC and other crypto-commodities.\n\nSource: 21Shares\n\nIn 2019, Charles Edwards proposed a methodology to estimate the global average US dollar cost of producing one BTC. The first component of the method is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption index (CBECI), which provides an up-to-date estimate of the bitcoin network\u2019s daily electricity load.\n\nEdwards estimates the cost of production per BTC by:\n\nCalculating the number of BTC mined per ray (based on miner rewards) Calculating the daily electricity cost to mine one BTC (daily electrical cost) Estimating the global average \u201celec-to-total cost ratio\u201d = (bitcoin electrical cost)/(daily cost of running a bitcoin mining business).\n\nAn investor can then compute bitcoin production cost as (daily electrical cost)/ (elec-to-total cost ratio).\n\nFinally, the bitcoin production cost is compared to the \u201cbitcoin miner price\u201d, which attempts to capture the revenue one BTC provides to miners.\n\nBitcoin miner price is calculated as follows: BTC price + (daily transaction fees)/(daily BTC mined).\n\nWhen the BTC price is below the total cost of mining one BTC, it signals that bitcoin miners may be struggling and potentially taking short-term losses.\n\nThe estimated global average electricity cost to mine one bitcoin is $23,211.1, as of 28 January, while the estimated global average total cost to mine one bitcoin is $38,685.1.\n\nTo reiterate, investors should not interpret this range as the fundamental value of bitcoin, which is subjective, but rather as an estimate of its price floor based on miner profitability and subsequent behaviour patterns.\n\nThis article first appeared in ETF Insider, ETF Stream's monthly ETF magazine for professional investors in Europe.

        "title": "3 Reasons Ethereum Price Could outperform Bitcoin in 2024 - crypto.news",
        "content": "Ethereum price broke above $3,9500 barrier again on Feb. 22, while Bitcoin price rally struggles for momentum: 3 vital market metrics suggest ETH could further extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead.\n\nEthereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) are historically closely correlated, but in 2024, ETH seems to have gained the upper hand. A deep dive into the on-chain data trends and expert analysis provides key insights into which asset would come out on top as the year unfolds.\n\nIs Ethereum better than Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nSo far in 2024, Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two largest assets in the crypto sector have attracted billions of dollars in capital inflows. As of March 2024, BTC is trading at historic all-time highs of $71,200, while ETH price attempts to establish a steady support above the $4,000 milestone.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the price charts shows that ETH currently has the upper hand having outperformed BTC by 7% in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nEthereum (ETH vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Price action January to March 2024 | Source: TradingView\n\nThe chart above shows that ETH price has increased 79% between Jan 1 and March 11 2024, which is significantly higher than Bitcoin\u2019s 72% price gains.\n\nHowever, while ETH currently has the upperhand, to determine which asset is a better value for money in 2024, it is important to examine the market catalyst driving both assets.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that both assets are driven by separate narratives and market catalysts in 2024.\n\nFor Ethereum, the ongoing ETH ETF filings, liquidity staking derivatives, the Eigen-layer re-staking and Dencun upgrade have emerged major themes within the ecosystem in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, the dominant themes for Bitcoin are the rapidly growing demand from the 10 newly-approved BTC ETFs and the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 19 2024.\n\nThese key events have triggered diverse changes in on-chain transaction trends and investment patterns across both ecosystems, leading to Ethereum price outpacing Bitcoin.\n\n3 reasons Ethereum price could outperform Bitcoin in 2024\n\nRetail investors are rallying behind ETH as Institutions dominate BTC markets\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 10 new Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 11 2024 marking a real milestone moment for the cryptocurrency sector. Within the 2 months post-launch the ETFs have rapidly acquired about 800,000 BTC, about 4.2% of the total supply in circulation.\n\nEvidently, Bitcoin price has benefited immensely from record-breaking inflows made by the corporate institutional investors in 2024. But interestingly, the ETF\u2019s dominance has triggered a skittish reaction among BTC retail investors, much to the apparent advancement of the Ethereum ecosystem growth.\n\nSantiment\u2019s total holders metric estimates the total number of active or funded wallet addresses that currently exist on a blockchain network. It serves a proxy for measuring the level of adoption among retail investors and the mass markets.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Total Holders vs Bitcoin (BTC) | Source: Santiment\n\nIn the last 50-days dating back to Jan. 21, the Ethereum network has attracted 3.59 million new holder addresses, while 200,000 BTC addresses emptied their wallets and exited the network.\n\nThis rare on-chain trend suggests that the retail mass markets are overwhelming behind Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes more concentrated in the hands of fewer whale investors and corporate entities, it puts BTC price at risk of market manipulation and external shock from the macroeconomic fronts.\n\nThe significant increase in new holder addresses on the Ethereum network compared to the number of BTC addresses emptying their wallets suggests a divergence in retail investor sentiment between the two cryptocurrencies.\n\nFirstly, this trend indicates that retail investors are increasingly favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin, potentially due to Ethereum\u2019s promise of profit-optimization and passive income from its low-risk staking yield to its retinue of decentralized finance applications (DApps).\n\nFurthermore, the growing dominance of institutional investors and corporate entities in the Bitcoin market introduces a new layer of uncertainty and potential risk. While institutional adoption has been a key driver of Bitcoin\u2019s recent price rally, it also increases the susceptibility of the market to large-scale sell-offs or coordinated trading strategies by these influential players.\n\nIn the event of a tradfi market downturn or macroeconomic policy changes, the concentrated ownership of Bitcoin in the hands of highly-sensitive Wall Street players could exacerbate BTC price declines and lead to heightened market volatility.\n\nBitcoin Miners Trading Bearish while Ethereum Node Validators remain bullish\n\nThe divergence in the current trading disposition of Bitcoin miners and Ethereum node validators is another vital market catalyst that could drive ETH price further ahead of BTC. On the Bitcoin network, miners dedicate computing resources to validate transactions and secure the network in exchange of BTC block rewards. Ethereum, since its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), now relies on its node validators for that critical function.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving event slated for April 19, will see miners\u2019 rewards slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.13 BTC. With the event now less than 40-days away Bitcoin miners have entered a selling frenzy in a bid to cash-in before the halving date.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Miner Reserves December 2023 to March 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs of Dec. 29 2023, Bitcoin miners held a total of 1.96 million BTC. But as the halving date drew closer, the miners rapidly offloaded 300,000 BTC, cutting down their balances to just 1.93 million BTC at press time on March 11 2024.\n\nValued at the current prices of $71,200, the miners have sold $21.5 billion worth of BTC in Q1 2024 ahead of the halving.\n\nIf the Bitcoin miner\u2019s selling trend persists, it could slow down the BTC price rally, especially in comparison to Ethereum whose node validators have been accumulating more coins in recent months.\n\nEthereum node validators have doubled down on their bullish positions, depositing 2.4 million ETH worth $9.7 billion into the beacon chain staking contracts since Jan. 2024, meanwhile Bitcoin miners entered a $21.5 billion selling spree.\n\nEthereum (ETH 2.0) Staking Deposits Jan 2024 \u2013 March 2024 | Source: Beaconcha.in\n\nAt press time on March 11, the total staking deposits on the ETH 2.0 beacon chain stood at $1.4 million ETH, representing a 2.4 million ($9.7 billion) increase in 2024.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin miners, Ethereum node validators continue to double-down on their long-term bullish positions as ETH price edges further above the $4,000 mark. Positive speculations surrounding the Dencun upgrade, and progress of ETH ETF filings are key catalysts incentivizing ETH stakeholders\u2019 bullish disposition.\n\nWith these catalysts still in play, ETH could witness even more coins taken out of circulation, while BTC circulation supply increases as miners increase selling pressure as the halving approaches.\n\nVanEck\u2019s Head of Digital Assets to Cryptoquant also echoed this stance in a recent interview with Cryptoquant.\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, ETH tends to outperform BTC in the halving year, right? So I don\u2019t want to lose the forest for the trees. I don\u2019t think there will be flippening, but I do think when the year (2024) is said and done, ETH will have outperformed BTC.\n\nIf these scenarios play out as predicted, ETH price will likely extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead.\n\nTechnical Indicators Highlight Ethereum\u2019s Path to $5,000\n\nIn summary, Ethereum is expected to pull greater retail market demand than Bitcoin and also experience a temporary decline in circulation supply amid rising staking deposits. These key factors put ETH price on a path to a new all time highs above $5,000.\n\nETH is currently trading above the $4,030 range at the time of writing on March 11. IntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money chart shows that Ethereum has a relatively clear path to reaching a new all time-high.\n\n\n\nAs seen below, the chart highlights the $4,500 territory as the largest resistance cluster above the current prices. At that range, 617,760 addresses had acquired 1.6 million ETH at the average price of $4,557.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nConsidering that they have been holding at a loss for 3-years, many of those holders could move to close their positions once Ethereum prices approach their break-even point.\n\nIf ETH price can establish a steady support level above that $4,500 area, it could potentially propel ETH price to a new all-time high above $5,000."

        "title": "Analysts lower odds of Ethereum ETF approval to 35% - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "In a recent shift of perspective, Bloomberg analysts have significantly lowered the forecast for the approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by May \u2014 setting the probability at a mere 35%.\n\nAccording to Eric Balchunas, the odds are down sharply from previous estimates, which ranged between 60% and 70%.\n\nThe revision reflects growing skepticism about the regulatory green light for Ethereum ETFs, contrasting the previously more optimistic stance.\n\nNo sign of activity\n\nThe caution among analysts follows recent discussions between Coinbase, Grayscale, and the SEC regarding the potential conversion of Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust into an ETF. While such meetings might usually indicate a positive trajectory, the absence of subsequent SEC commentary has tempered expectations.\n\nBalchunas and other analysts \u2014 including James Seyffart and Eleanor Terret \u2014 said that there is a distinct lack of activity in the regulatory circles despite the deadline being two months away.\n\nIn contrast, there was a flurry of activity among the SEC and spot Bitcoin ETF issuers for more than 10 weeks before the applications were approved.\n\nSeyffart said:\n\n\u201cThis Ethereum ETF cycle feels like the opposite of Bitcoin ETF approval odds at the moment. The more we see/hear (and don\u2019t see/hear), the less optimistic I become.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analysts added that the activity could pick up pace in the coming days. They also said that the expectation remains that an ETH ETF will be approved sometime this year \u2014 even if not in May.\n\nCautiously hopeful\n\nDespite these lowered expectations, some industry observers like Variant Fund\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Jake Chervinsky, remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the upcoming weeks could provide clearer signals about the SEC\u2019s direction.\n\nHowever, he also raised concerns that the SEC may treat Ethereum like a security and would be unwilling to approve the applications without judicial intervention.\n\nThe overall sentiment appears to be veering towards skepticism, with major investment banks such as JPMorgan and TD Cowen also projecting unlikely approval by May.\n\nIn contrast to the Bloomberg analysts, the crypto market-making firm GSR has maintained a more hopeful stance, initially estimating a 70% chance of approval.\n\nHowever, the firm recently admitted that this optimism might soon wane if there\u2019s no visible progress in the next month.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Chartered has said multiple times that the SEC is likely to approve Ethereum ETFs in May.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 8:54 pm UTC on Mar. 11, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 3.37% over the past 24 hours.

        "title": "Three reasons why the SEC might not greenlight Ethereum ETFs - DLNews",
        "content": "Analysts are getting pessimistic about the chances of Ethereum spot ETFs being approved in May.\n\nThe SEC could decide to deny the applications for a number of reasons.\n\nThese include political pushback, the uncertainty around Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, and a lower risk of litigation.\n\nDespite approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission may deny similar products for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by value.\n\nThe agency has yet to meaningfully engage with prospective Ethereum spot ETF issuers, Bloomberg analysts have noted, and with a crucial deadline looming in two and a half months, the lack of communication isn\u2019t a good sign.\n\nWhy the SEC may deny\n\nThere are three main reasons why the SEC may deny spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe first is that Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status isn\u2019t clearly defined. While SEC chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin is a commodity and should be regulated as such, he has made great efforts to remain vague about Ethereum.\n\nMuddying the waters is that the SEC approved Ethereum futures ETFs in October. That means the regulator \u201cimplicitly [classified] Ethereum as a non-security commodity,\u201d according to ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci.\n\nThe second reason has to do with political blowback. The SEC was heavily criticised by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, for greenlighting Bitcoin spot ETFs \u2014 even though it approved these ETFs only after a court loss.\n\n\u201cThe SEC is wrong on the law and wrong on the policy with respect to the Bitcoin ETF decision,\u201d Warren posted on X in January, before adding that the agency was letting \u201ccrypto burrow even deeper into our financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cGary is in the Warren doghouse\u201d for issuing the Bitcoin spot ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X on Sunday. \u201cIt may be that simple.\u201d\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe third reason is that the SEC may believe it\u2019s less exposed to the threat of lawsuits. Grayscale Investments sued the agency after it denied its application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, but may be less inclined to do so this time around.\n\n\u201cGrayscale may be less excited to subsidise another blockbuster hit product for BlackRock,\u201d Balchunas said, referring to the overwhelming success of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, which was launched in January at the same time as Grayscale secured the right to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nAlternatively, the SEC \u201ccould come up with new grounds for denial that weren\u2019t tested by Grayscale in court, which would likely also be subject to a court challenge but may be easier for the SEC to justify,\u201d Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at venture-capital firm Variant, wrote on Monday.\n\nThe agency could also be \u201cwilling to take litigation risk and lose in court based on a preference for being viewed as \u2018fighters\u2019 in a war against crypto rather than being accused of rolling over,\u201d Chervinsky said.\n\nShould it decide to approve the Ethereum spot ETFs, the SEC is likely to proceed as it did with Bitcoin ETFs and greenlight all of them at once to avoid giving an unfair advantage to a particular fund. That brings the final deadline for a decision to May 23.\n\nBalchunas revised on Monday the odds of an Ethereum spot ETF approval to 35% \u2014 down from 70% in February.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, trading at $71,342.\n\nEthereum slumped 1.5% in the same period, priced at $3,962.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous political challenges following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a court loss to Grayscale in August 2023 could also be factors in the SEC\u2019s current approach.\n\nEthereum traded at around US$3,970, at 3 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko."

        "title": "As Ethereum L2s multiply, new layer 3 blockchain aims to stitch them together - DLNews",
        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s focus on L2s comes at a cost, spreading liquidity across dozens of blockchains.\n\nLayer 3 blockchain ZkLink Nova, which aggregates liquidity across five L2s, launched Monday.\n\nEthereum\u2019s mass market appeal rests on so-called layer 2 blockchains: faster, cheaper blockchains that funnel into Ethereum, letting users dodge its notoriously high transaction fees.\n\nThere are more than 40 of these layer 2 blockchains, according to one estimate. Most are islands unto themselves: although protocols like PancakeSwap, a decentralised exchange, can be found on several layer 2 blockchains, assets on the many versions of PancakeSwap are siloed.\n\nA new layer 3 blockchain \u2014 a layer 2 for layer 2s \u2014 aims to fix that.\n\nZkLink Nova, which launched Monday, aggregates liquidity across five layer 2 blockchains: zkSync, Linea, Arbitrum, Manta, and Mantle.\n\n\u201cThe point is to deploy products that can, sort of, unify liquidity and users,\u201d Declan Fox, head of business development at Linea, told DL News.\n\nThat means that an application deployed on those blockchains effectively shares assets. This larger pool of assets \u2014 or deeper liquidity, in market-speak \u2014 should make it easier to execute large trades without affecting an asset\u2019s price.\n\nThe L2 boom\n\nLike all blockchains, Ethereum groups transactions into blocks, then appends them to an immutable ledger. Its transaction fee reflects the demand for space in each block, spiking along with user activity.\n\nBut a spike in activity can send the cost of a single transaction well above $100, an astronomical sum for the average investor.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nDevelopers have bet the most convenient road to mass market appeal goes through cheaper layer 2 blockchains, which batch transactions before appending them to Ethereum.\n\nThat plan is coming to fruition. There are more than 40 layer 2 blockchains, according to L2BEAT, and another 35 in development.\n\nExisting layer 2 blockchains have processed almost twice as many transactions as Ethereum itself over the past year, according to data collected by Jack Gorman, a data scientist at venture capital firm Variant Fund.\n\nEthereum users have enjoyed massive savings: The average cost to swap tokens on Ethereum was just under $17 Monday morning, according to l2fees.info. It was between $0.68 and $2.16 on the major layer 2 blockchains the website tracks.\n\nlayer 3 blockchains take the concept a step further, creating a sort of blockchain-based Russian nesting doll in which each layer is cheaper than the last.\n\nzkLink Nova\n\nUnlike the few existing layer 3 blockchains, zkLink Nova will be general purpose rather than application specific.\n\nZkLink spokesman Neil Liew said Nova would offer \u201creal interoperability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Nova there is no need to bridge assets across chains, because the same ERC-20 token on zkSync and Linea, for example, is represented as a single token on zkLink Nova,\u201d he said. \u201cNova simplifies DeFi by presenting a unified ecosystem for users and DApps, promoting a seamless blockchain experience.\u201d\n\nWhile it aggregates transactions across several blockchains, it settles on Linea, an L2 that also runs on zero-knowledge technology. ZK technology creates \u201cproofs\u201d that are posted to Ethereum for verification.\n\n\u201cYou get additional savings on the settlement cost,\u201d Fox said.\n\n\u201cRather than having to verify your proof directly on Ethereum, which is costly \u2026 what you\u2019re doing now is, you\u2019re actually settling on Linea, and Linea gas price is orders of magnitude cheaper than Ethereum.\u201d\n\nLiew said zkLink will add other L2 blockchains in the future, and should be considered a complimentary, rather than competitive, product.\n\n\u201cWe are facilitating more user flow and liquidity flow into their chains and enhancing capital efficiency between the chains,\u201d he said.\n\nZkLink\u2019s three-step roadmap includes the eventual launch of ZKL, a governance token issued to incentivize a decentralised sequencer \u2014 the technology that orders transactions on layer 2 and layer 3 blockchains.\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum developers will roll out the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade on Wednesday, March 13. Developers have told Decrypt that the impact on gas fees for Ethereum scaling networks will be dramatic, with some estimating that they'll drop by 75% immediately.\n\nThe name is a portmanteau of Cancun and Deneb, two separate upgrades that have been combined to create the term \"Dencun.\" A word of caution for Ethereum upgrade first-timers: There's nothing that users need to do. Be wary of any blog, email, or Twitter (aka X) post that says otherwise and asks you to click a link or connect your wallet.\n\nLeading up to the upgrade, Dencun has already been pushed live on several of Ethereum's testnets. But the real push, to Ethereum's mainnet, will occur later this week. The upgrade is happening roughly a year after the Shanghai upgrade from April 2023, when the newly upgraded proof-of-stake network made it possible for users to unstake their ETH.\n\nThis new upgrade is targeted at addressing core aspects of Ethereum\u2019s framework, including its scalability, security, and overall user experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the heart of the Dencun upgrade is the implementation of proto-danksharding, a cutting-edge concept designed to significantly reduce transaction fees and increase processing speed across the network.\n\n\"This is the beginning of a new paradigm for how Ethereum operates,\u201d Karl Floersch, the CEO of OP Labs, which builds layer-2 network Optimism, told Decrypt earlier this month.\n\nThe optimization is expected to make Ethereum a more attractive network to build on for startups, which could add even more protocols to its already bustling decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nEthereum has long hosted the largest DeFi ecosystem when measured by the number of protocols. In fact, it has seldom accounted for less than half of the entire total value locked in DeFi projects. At the time of writing, there are 990 Ethereum-based projects, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upgrade also includes several key Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), each tailored to enhance specific functionalities within the network. For example, EIP-7044 will introduce programmable staking exits.\n\nValidators secure the Ethereum network by locking up 32 ETH as their pledge to keep their validator client running and handle the transactions that come their way. If they don't, they stand to lose a portion of their 32 ETH to penalties.\n\nFor users who don't have 32 ETH to become a solo staker, there are pooled staking options. They allow users to deposit any amount of Ethereum and earn a share of the staking rewards (minus the pool fees, of course).\n\nBut what happens if the validator with whom you've staked your ETH experiences downtime and part of your staked funds get slashed?\n\nEIP-7044 will make it possible for ETH validators and stakers to store instructions for when to exit their position\u2014called perpetually valid signed voluntary exits\u2014in smart contracts, and specify when they should be carried out.\n\nFor example, someone running a validator node may want to exit if their hardware remains inactive for a certain number of blocks processed. This is an important protection for validators because they could face mounting fines if they're unable to process transactions on time.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nLegendary trader Raoul Pal has doubled down on his forecast for the trio of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow high can Bitcoin soar?\n\nIn a YouTube chat with Anthony Scaramucci, Raoul Pal noted that he believes the Bitcoin price can end this current cycle with a massive price of $250,000. For reference, the Bitcoin price is actively in discovery mode, and it just recorded another all-time high (ATH) above $71,000 as optimism surrounding the coin remains sustained.\n\nDespite the $250,000 price target, Raoul Pal is not convinced this is the best the digital currency could do. He noted that the valuation could be higher depending on the trend in the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF has remained the dominant catalyst driving the price of BTC to new heights. The daily accumulation from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Ark Invest and Bitwise, notably surpassed the amount of BTC generated through mining.\n\nWhile an average of 5,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC is stacked up daily, only about 900 BTC are generated across the board, creating a notable supply shock that might help drive the price toward the estimated $250,000 in the long term.\n\nEthereum and Solana get high targets\n\nIn addition to the Bitcoin forecast, Raoul Pal projected a $17,000 to $20,000 surge for Ethereum this bull cycle, while he noted that Solana might jump as high as $700 to $1,000.\n\nWhile the duo of Ethereum and Solana have not retested their respective ATHs at $4,800 and $260 this ongoing bullish run, Raoul Pal has always highlighted their fundamentals as a key catalyst that can drive growth in the long term.\n\nOther analysts have even more bullish projections for Bitcoin as well as Ethereum and Solana, and time will tell how high the three digital currencies will grow this bull cycle."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Latest All-Time High Powers Ethereum and Dogecoin Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin's streak of generating new all-time highs may not be over, prompting growing interest in other key digital assets.\n\nIt's another hot start to what looks likely to be another big week in the cryptocurrency world. Leading cryptos are once again surging, with Bitcoin (BTC 0.16%), Ethereum (ETH -0.28%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -3.98%) all making big moves.\n\nAs of 12:15 p.m. ET Monday, these three mega-cap cryptos had surged 3.8%, 2.9%, and 0.9%, respectively, over the prior 24 hours. Importantly, Bitcoin made a new all-time high above $72,500. In the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), continued capital inflows into those funds are creating a clear supply-and-demand imbalance for this top crypto. This catalyst, as well as anticipation of the upcoming halving event in April -- which will cut the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half and thus reduce the volume of new Bitcoin being created -- is exacerbating expectations that Bitcoin's recent momentum can continue.\n\nMost investors who follow crypto can understand the rather simple dynamics driving Bitcoin higher. But for more complex reasons, Bitcoin's recent surge could also mean continued upside for Ethereum and Dogecoin, two projects that are very different from Bitcoin in key ways.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin's move a sectorwide phenomenon?\n\nThere's certainly something to be said about Bitcoin's status as the key crypto benchmark other digital assets are valued against. The Bitcoin/U.S. dollar exchange rate is very important in the crypto world, with Bitcoin largely being viewed as the currency of choice for this sector. That should mean that as Bitcoin becomes more valuable, other tokens relative to Bitcoin should become relatively cheaper, at least compared to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, during previous rallies, this hasn't been the case. And while capital is clearly flowing in one direction (toward Bitcoin via these exchange-traded funds), it's also true that retail investors and even some large money managers are finding ways to accumulate other cryptocurrencies ahead of what many expect could be a continued rally in risk assets.\n\nFor Ethereum specifically, the possibility that a spot Ethereum ETF could be approved as soon as May is a key catalyst many investors are watching. The Ethereum network is also undertaking a number of upgrades, including the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which is expected to unfold within two days. As investors may remember, \"the Merge\" upgrade created significant hype for this network as Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake protocol from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol. The Dencun upgrade will look to build on that progress, with a focus on reducing Layer-2 transaction costs and making the network more efficient.\n\nFor meme tokens like Dogecoin, it has been \"party on,\" mostly due to the risk-on atmosphere that has been building in pockets of the market. Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin that rely more on the value of their community and backers have seen outsized interest as a result of surging asset prices across the board in this sector. For now, the thesis supporting Dogecoin's rise may be as simple as \"price goes up,\" but it's also true that leveraged bets to the upside via long perpetual contracts are playing into Dogecoin's surge in recent days.\n\nHow long will this party continue?\n\nUntil we see some sort of slowdown in the flow of capital into Bitcoin, it appears increasingly unlikely we'll see the kind of material pullback many crypto bears have been predicting. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have siphoned an incredible amount of capital from institutional investors in record time, and the level of demand has surprised even some of the most ardent crypto bulls. If Ethereum and other digital assets can see similar waves of investment, all bets are off with respect to how long this period of price appreciation may last.\n\nUpgrades and other utility-generating use cases for a wide range of cryptocurrencies (and select meme tokens can be included in this group) could drive the fundamental investing thesis behind these digital assets as well. While I'm less enthusiastic about Dogecoin's long-term prospects relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, its recent move is worth noting. In the crypto sector, speculative interest can manifest itself in significant near-term volatility, as we've seen play out in the past. Accordingly, these are three tokens every investor interested in the crypto space will want to watch moving forward."

        "content": "Never have I ever seen so much anti-Ethereum propaganda on my Twitter timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery other day, there\u2019s a new Layer 1 that is doubted as the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d, but Ethereum doesn\u2019t know it, so it remains undeterred, focusing on its growth and improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis commitment to progress is evident in the recently unveiled Ethereum roadmap for 2024, spotlighting key developments that promise to enhance scalability and user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those, finally, a date was set for EIP-4844, which will make it much easier for Layer 2 to publish data on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile competition becomes fierce, these new ERC and EIP are set to greatly improve Ethereum's scalability and user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's dive into these exciting updates, including ERC-4337, EIP-4844, EIP-3074, and EIP-5003.\n\nERC-4337: Revolutionizing Smart Contract Wallets\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the ERC-4337 standard is a significant leap in the evolution of smart contract wallets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis improvement introduces a novel concept called \"account abstraction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nERC-4337 is an Account Abstraction proposal that completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the bottom-layer transaction type, this proposal introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on ERC-4337: https://twitter.com/johnrising_/status/1629470535397539840\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum accounts are separated into externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. However, user-operated EOAs often pose challenges in terms of usability and security.\n\n\n\n\n\nERC-4337 blurs these lines, allowing users to interact with smart contracts more intuitively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way users interact with Ethereum needs to step up to the enhanced complexity of the landscape. We have already seen the emergence of Account abstraction-based solutions, such as Creso Wallet and Avocado Wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of ERC-4337 will pose the foundation for a series of improvements to wallet designs, as well as reduced complexity for end users.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, ERC-4337 greatly improves the end-user experience as well as enables new possibilities such as gasless transactions or social logins and password recovery.\n\nKey Features of ERC-4337 Include:\n\nEnhanced Security: By integrating more complex logic into wallets, users can set conditions for transactions, like multi-factor authentication or daily spending limits.\n\n\n\n\n\nUser-Friendly: It simplifies interactions for non-technical users, making the Ethereum ecosystem more accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\nGas Fee Payments in Tokens: Users could potentially pay transaction fees in tokens other than ETH, adding a layer of convenience.\n\nEIP-4844: Boosting Layer 2 Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy EIP-4844: To create a cheap place for L2 solutions to post data on Ethereum and reduce overall transaction fees users pay on L2 by a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: L2s produce an increasing amount of data. If there\u2019s a way to post that data cheaply, this will immediately reduce how much the networks charge users to transact.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: New transaction format for \u201cblob-carrying transactions\u201d. It contains a large amount of data that \u201ccannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed.\u201d Instead of embedding the full contents in the body, the contents of the blobs are propagated separately, as a \u201csidecar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-4844, often referred to as \"proto-danksharding\" is a significant stride towards solving Ethereum's scalability issues. It introduces a new transaction type that allows \"shard blobs\" \u2013 temporary data that can be used by Layer 2 solutions like rollups.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-4844 introduces a new kind of transaction type to Ethereum which accepts \"blobs\" of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of containing transactions being executed in the Ethereum blocks, shard blocks would just contain \u201cblobs of data\u201d and would be the responsibility of L2 to use that data space to create a secure and more scalable experience for their users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is important about EIP-4844 is that its value will trickle down to users, as we will all be able to benefit from lower L2 fees.\n\nWhy Will L2s Fees Be Lower?\n\nEIP-4844 separates fees for transaction computation and storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nL2 will use a different function to submit \u201cblobs\u201d to Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using \u201cCALLDATA\u201d, which stores data forever, they would use blobs, which are pruned after a pre-defined period.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blobs of data don\u2019t have to be available forever, but for a certain period (e.g., 1-3 months), long enough to allow L2s to ensure at least 1 honest actor to reconstruct the state and challenge or replace the bad sequencer. The data gets then pruned.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-4844 provides significant scaling relief for rollups by allowing them to initially scale to 0.25 MB per slot, with a separate fee market for blobs allowing fees to be very low.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead: transactions will be 10x cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Potential Impacts of EIP-4844 Include\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Costs for Layer 2: By lowering the data costs, it makes Layer 2 solutions more economical, encouraging broader adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Transaction Throughput: This can lead to a more scalable network, capable of handling more transactions per second.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced User Experience: With faster and cheaper transactions, the overall user experience on Ethereum improves dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wrote an extensive article on this a while ago:\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-3074: Streamlining Transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EIP-3074 is a new primitive, that will open the doors for more seamless UX on Ethereum, without the need for additional trust assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-3074 introduces a fundamental change in how Ethereum transactions are authorized and executed. The proposal allows a user to authorize a third party to execute transactions on their behalf, using a new type of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-3074 aims to update Ethereum\u2019s EOAs so they can delegate control to smart contracts \u2014 allowing smart contracts to approve transactions originating from user accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, EIP-3074 would allow the execution of complex operations with a single signature, with no need for multiple approvals, greatly improving the UX as well as allowing the execution of complex operations seamlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd users will be able to send batched transactions, expiring transactions, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on EIP-3074: https://twitter.com/lightclients/status/1371911245561917441\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for this to work, the Ethereum protocol would need to be modified, with two new EVM \u201copcodes\u201d: AUTH and AUTHCALL.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this reason, EIP-3074 is usually viewed less favorably compared to other Account Abstraction proposals, such as EIP-4337.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on the concerns about this EIP:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1418441829314220032\n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, EIP-3074 would introduce new use cases, such as:\n\nSmart Contract wallets: with wallet recovery solutions you will never lose your funds again.\n\nBatch Transactions: saving on gas costs.\n\nAutomations: automate transactions thanks to smart contract accounts.\n\nThe Benefits of EIP-3074 Include:\n\nSimplified User Interactions: Especially beneficial for complex DApp interactions, reducing the steps and gas costs for users.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Flexibility for Developers: This allows for more creative and efficient smart contract designs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Security Enhancements: Though it introduces new security considerations, it also offers the opportunity for more robust security mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-5003: Network Resource Optimization\n\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal combines very well with EIP-3074, which provides the \u201copcodes\u201d to delegate EAOs signing authority to a smart contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile EIP-3074 authorizes smart contracts, EIP-5003 completely migrates the signing key of Ethereum EOAs accounts to smart contract accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA limited application of only EIP-3074 would create new vectors of attacks around the authority delegation to smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile EIP-5003 is less publicized, it plays a crucial role in enhancing the Ethereum network's efficiency and security.\n\nThe Expected Advantages of EIP-5003 Are:\n\nImproved Security: This EIP combines with EIP-3074 to solve its shortcomings and ensure there are no new vectors of attack from the Account Abstraction\u2019s migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration away from EOAs: This EIP is the final migration away from EOAs.\n\nConclusion: A Future-Proof Ethereum\n\nWhile its development is often considered to be slow and controlled to prioritize security, Ethereum does not stay idle, and it would be incorrect to observe and assess its technology only according to what it looks like at every specific moment in time, for it is always evolving and improving.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, Ethereum's 2024 roadmap illustrates a clear vision for the future, and a commitment to addressing critical areas like scalability, security, accessibility, and usability and making sure the network remains future-proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nA strong focus is placed on redefining how users interact with Ethereum, shifting from EOA accounts to more flexible smart contract wallets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation of ERC-4337, EIP-4844, EIP-3074, and EIP-5003, each plays a pivotal role in this evolutionary journey:\n\n\n\n\n\nERC-4337 revolutionizes smart contract wallets through account abstraction, offering enhanced security and user-friendliness. This standard is poised to significantly simplify the user experience and broaden accessibility to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEIP-4844, or \"proto-danksharding\" is a breakthrough in reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions. By introducing a new transaction format for blob-carrying transactions, it promises to lower transaction fees and increase throughput, benefiting the end users with more affordable and faster transactions.\n\nEIP-3074 and EIP-5003 together represent a significant step in streamlining transactions and optimizing network resources. While EIP-3074 introduces new operational capabilities for authorizing transactions, EIP-5003 complements it by transitioning signing authority from Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to smart contract accounts, bolstering network security and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Ethereum continues to innovate and improve, it will continue to fight for its relevance in the face of heightened competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of this piece is to incentivize readers to look at Ethereum not as a static network but as a network in constant development and evolution, actively working to become future-proof against emerging technologies and alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue monitoring the implementation of EIP and how Ethereum will evolve over the year.\n\nThe author of this post is not associated with the projects mentioned in this article in any way.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, is adequately prepared to counter the potential threat posed by a large-scale quantum computing attack on the network.\n\nIn a recent post on Ethereum Research dated March 9, Buterin outlined a sudden \u201cquantum emergency\u201d where quantum computers are suddenly accessible, and malicious actors can exploit them to steal users\u2019 assets.\n\nHe discussed Ethereum\u2019s readiness to handle such a situation, emphasizing its ability to mitigate the impact and protect users\u2019 funds in the event of such an attack.\n\nIf the blockchain were to undergo a hard fork, users would just need to update their software, minimizing the risk of fund loss. Buterin elaborated that the hard fork would involve rolling back the Ethereum network to a point where it\u2019s evident that significant theft occurred and then halting all regular transactions from that moment onward.\n\nDevelopers would then introduce a new transaction type, outlined in EIP-7560, specifically designed to enable transactions from smart contract wallets.\n\nIn a scenario where transactions are made from an Ethereum wallet, the signature of the transaction discloses the public key. In a \u201cpost-quantum era,\u201d this exposure could potentially reveal the user\u2019s private key.\n\nThe proposed quantum-resistant Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introduces a new transaction type that relies on Winternitz signatures and advanced cryptographic techniques like STARKs. This aims to update existing wallet validation mechanisms, ensuring enhanced security against quantum threats without compromising user privacy.\n\nThis verification code utilizes ERC-4337 account abstraction, which is the foundational technology of smart contract wallets. It prevents the exposure of private keys when signing transactions in the future, thus making these accounts resistant to quantum attacks."

        "content": "With Bitcoin surging above $71,000 for the first time, altcoins like Ethereum have embarked on renewed waves of recovery so far in March 2024. Amidst this bull run, ETH prices tapped new yearly highs, feeding optimism around the crypto\u2019s outlook. The big question now is: just how high can Ethereum trend in the months ahead?\n\nAnalysis of price charts reveals Ethereum, with its $479 billion market cap, has surged past the $4,000 level for the first time in two years. A 75% increase in trading volumes to $22 billion supports this signal of strengthening upside momentum.\n\nAfter logging 15% gains last week, ETH has rallied 60% across the past 30 days. Ethereum has notched a bullish milestone that hints at a trend reversal.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: Top 3 Coins To Buy Under $10 For Better Gains\n\nCan Ethereum hit $5,000 next?\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price is able to sustain support around the $4,000 area in the coming weeks, some analysts estimate the next likely upside target could be around $6,835 based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level.\n\nThis would represent the next key price milestone if the current bullish momentum is maintained. However, prices could also consolidate or correct before any potential further upside.\n\nEthereum hit its all-time high of $4,891 on November 16, 2021. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency is just 18% away from breaching its previous all-time highs.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Forecasted To Surge 540% & Hit New ATH: Here\u2019s When\n\nOf course, if existing market conditions deteriorate again, Ethereum may see a downside. However, indicators presently favor the ongoing bullish structure persisting through February.\n\nSo, with ETH firmly back in recovery mode, early technical clues support the growing narrative of history repeating itself this cycle. If Bitcoin manages to sustain the $71,000 level, ETH and other altcoins could stage a bullish outlook in the coming days."

At approximately 2:30 pm ET, the fork went live, introducing a dedicated data storage channel called blobs to enhance scaling on layer-2 networks.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade focuses on improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability by facilitating cheaper transactions on rollups, which leverage Ethereum for data availability. Ethereum core developers confirmed no errors were reported after the fork, and the chain is now finalizing with blobs.\n\nMartin Koeppelmann, Gnosis co-founder, stated that while rollups might not achieve sub-cent transaction fees, the Dencun hard fork on Gnosis Chain serves as a horizontal scaling solution complementing layer-2s. \u201cWe still think we need more, so we have Gnosis Chain as our horizontal scaling similar to Ethereum, and now we also do layer-2s on top of Gnosis Chain,\u201d Koeppelmann said.\n\nPhillippe Schommers, Gnosis\u2019 infrastructure director, emphasized the chain\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum. \u201cWe really want to stay exactly like Ethereum so that an application developed for Ethereum can come to Gnosis Chain seamlessly,\u201d Schommers stated.\n\nOne of the first applications leveraging layer-2s on Gnosis Chain will be Gnosis Pay, a payments network currently operating on the base layer but set to migrate to layer-2s for regulatory submission."

        "title": "Comparison Between Solana and Ethereum - ForexLive",
        "content": "When evaluating the blockchain space, two platforms frequently come up for comparison: Solana and Ethereum. Both have garnered significant attention, each with its own set of strengths that appeal to different users and developers in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nPerformance and Transaction Speed\n\nOne of the most notable differences between Solana and Ethereum is in terms of performance, particularly transaction speed. Solana has made a name for itself with its high throughput capacity, being able to handle about 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Ethereum currently processes roughly 30 TPS. This stark contrast is due to Solana\u2019s unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (PoH), combined with the Proof of Stake (PoS) model, which allows for quicker validation of transactions and blocks.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, is transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to a PoS system through its Ethereum 2.0 update, aiming to increase its transaction speed and reduce energy consumption. However, until this transition is complete, Solana takes the lead in performance.\n\nScalability\n\nScalability is another crucial factor in the comparison. Solana's architecture gives it a significant scalability edge, allowing for the support of thousands of nodes without sacrificing speed. Ethereum, with its current architecture, faces challenges in scaling, although layer two solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum are providing off-chain scaling options. The shift to Ethereum 2.0 also promises to address these concerns by introducing sharding, which will spread the network load across 64 new chains.\n\nCost\n\nTransaction costs are vastly different on Solana compared to Ethereum. Solana boasts extremely low transaction fees due to its efficient processing capabilities. Ethereum's fees, however, can vary widely and tend to be much higher, especially during periods of network congestion. This aspect makes Solana more attractive for microtransactions and decentralized applications (dApps) requiring a large number of transactions.\n\nDecentralization and Security\n\nEthereum is widely recognized for its level of decentralization and security, having a large and diversified network of nodes. While Solana\u2019s architecture has led to a smaller node count, its newer network hasn't yet faced the same level of scrutiny or attack as Ethereum. Thus, Ethereum might be seen as more secure and decentralized at this moment.\n\nEcosystem and Adoption\n\nEthereum has a first-mover advantage, being the pioneer for smart contracts and dApps. It has an enormous and thriving ecosystem with a multitude of dApps, tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Solana is newer but growing quickly, developing its ecosystem and attracting developers with its performance benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether Solana is \"better\" than Ethereum depends largely on what metric you're measuring. If transaction speed and cost are your primary concerns, Solana may appear to be the superior platform. If decentralization, security, and ecosystem maturity are more important, Ethereum might be the preferred choice. Ultimately, the \"better\" platform will depend on the specific needs of the users and developers, and the continuous evolution of both platforms keeps this as an ongoing conversation in the blockchain community."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s (ETH-USD) levels are currently under scrutiny as cryptocurrency analysts and investors peer into its performance after breaking the $4,000 value area \u2013 a level not seen for ETH since December 2021.\n\nAs the leading altcoin and second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap behind Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum has fundamentally redefined how applications are built and operated on the Internet. It boasts a robust ecosystem that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nThis in-depth analysis of the daily and weekly charts reveals a nuanced picture: weekly indicators signal caution, while daily trends suggest resilience and potential for continued upward momentum.\n\nAnalysis of the Daily Chart: Potential for Continued Uptrend\n\nETH-USD Daily Chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nEthereum\u2019s technical conditions on the daily chart exhibit signs of bearish sentiment. The Composite Index, a crucial momentum indicator, has decisively crossed below its moving averages and is a bearish warning sign, indicating potential downward pressure on price.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO), which remains above the zero line. The DPO\u2019s position indicates underlying strength, suggesting that the prior uptrend may continue despite the immediate bearish outlook.\n\nInsights from the Weekly Chart: Indicators Suggest Caution\n\nETH-USD Weekly Chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nExpanding our analysis to the weekly timeframe reveals a broader perspective of Ethereum\u2019s market trajectory. The trendlines, extending back to July 2022, illustrate a dominant upward trend, with the recent steepening slope suggesting a parabolic rise.\n\nThe immediate support level on this parabolic trendline is identified at $3,687. Furthermore, the Composite Index has reached historical resistance levels and shows a downward slope, while the DPO marks its highest levels since August 2021, signaling potential volatility.\n\nThe Outlook Is Mixed\n\nWhile long-term indicators suggest a cautious approach due to bearish signals, hidden strength on the daily chart and the strong support levels identified on the weekly chart offer a counterbalance. These insights suggest that while near-term volatility is likely, given the increased institutional interest in Ethereum and a broader bullish mood for crypto, a resumption of the uptrend has a strong probability of occurring."

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nLower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\n\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\n\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.\n\nDencun to lower Ethereum layer 2 fees\n\nIt\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week.\n\nCancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nAmong them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nLayer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base.\n\nEIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBy reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs.\n\nEIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December.\n\nThe end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nAfter Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones.\n\nMakerDAO almost runs out of USDC\n\nCrypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week.\n\nThe PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar.\n\nBecause Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols.\n\nIn response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market.\n\nIn ~2 hours, @MakerDAO will implement some unprecedented rates moves. There\u2019s been some confusion about the cause, reasoning behind, and likely effect of these changes.

They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins.\n\nMemecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours.\n\nData of the week\n\nBlockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade.\n\nIt allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place.\n\n69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

The upgrade is expected to reduce the transaction cost for Layer 2 tokens that scale the Ethereum network.\n\nPolygon (MATIC), ImmutableX (IMX), Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB) and Mantle (MNT) prices dropped between 3% and 5% on the day..\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price unlikely to be moved by SEC ETF decision as approval odds diminish, analysts say\n\nLayer 2 tokens bleed\n\nEthereum is facing criticism from crypto experts for its upcoming upgrade as it focuses on reducing transaction costs for Layer 2 solutions and not the underlying blockchain.\n\nJustin Bons, Founder and CEO of CyberCapital, argues that Ethereum is now \u201cfully committed to mediocrity.\u201d Bons said in a recent tweet on X that the Layer 1 chain has zero plans to scale its underlying blockchain and Ethereum is pushing users to Layer 2 chains instead.

The first wallet, identified as dForcenet, deposited 2.45 million ARB worth $5.05 million to Binance, and the second swapped 1.03 million ARB worth $2.13 million for USDC. Both transactions occurred on Tuesday, likely contributing to the overall decline in L2 token prices.\n\nEthereum price hit its 2024 high of $4,093 on Binance earlier today. The altcoin has experienced a pullback since then and is exchanging hands at $4,026, at the time of writing."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nThe likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving an Ethereum (ETH) spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has significantly decreased.\n\nThis is evidenced by market sentiment on platforms like Polymarket, where the approval odds dropped to 24%.\n\nDespite the crypto community's optimism earlier this year, recent developments indicate a growing skepticism about the SEC's approval of Ethereum ETFs, particularly in the lead-up to the anticipated decision date of May 23.\n\nDiminishing optimism\n\nEleanor Terrett, a reporter at Fox Business, has noted that there has been a significant change in mood regarding the SEC's stance on Ethereum ETFs.\n\nInsiders suggest that the SEC, under Chairman Gary Gensler, is less engaged in discussions about Ethereum ETFs compared to their Bitcoin counterparts, hinting at a possible contentment with the progress made with Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, political pressure from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the SEC's approval of Bitcoin ETFs, seems to be influencing the regulator's approach toward Ethereum products.\n\nRegulatory delays\n\nThe SEC has recently postponed its decision on various Ethereum ETF proposals, including those from financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity. This has set the stage for further uncertainty despite the fact that such an outcome was expected by market analysts.\n\nThis delay signals a cautious approach from the SEC, mirroring its previous hesitance with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg, has tempered expectations for Ether ETFs, likening them to an opening act following a headliner. Jake Chervinsky, Variant's chief legal officer, speculated the SEC's cautious approach is influenced by political resistance and market volatility.\n\nDespite this, the crypto industry remains hopeful, looking for signs of potential approval in the regulator's future actions and commentary."

        "content": "Bitcoin crossed the $70,000 mark to hit an all-time high of $72,242.51 before retracing to its current price of $71,947. As BTC soared, Ethereum price also tagged along crossing the $4,000 mark, having grown by 60% in the past 30 days. The leading altcoin by capitalization achieved its all-time high of $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021. Now the price of ETH is only 18.03% away from this peak, will it meet the expectations of optimistic investors and enthusiasts and achieve this milestone?\n\nEthereum Price Market Performance\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price is trading at $4,009 having decreased by 0.6% in the past day. However, it has experienced increasing investor activity demonstrated by the 2.18% increase in trading volume to reach $23.9 billion in the last 24 hours. Its market cap of $481.29 has positioned it on CoinMarketCap as the 2nd cryptocurrency in the market, with a circulating price of 120,093,479 ETH. The coin value has grown by 32% since it crossed the $3,000 mark on March 20, 2024, which is only 20 days ago.\n\nFactors That Could Drive Ethereum Prices Higher\n\nThere are various factors that would possibly propel Bitcoin price towards its all-time high.\n\n1. Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe anticipation surrounding the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade and the introduction of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d has sparked a wave of excitement among investors and developers within the platform\u2019s ecosystem. Scheduled to go live on March 13, this upgrade promises to reduce congestion and transaction fees significantly for Layer 2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. The upgrade tackles major scalability hurdles making Ethereum more accessible to both users and developers.\n\nAdditionally, developments in Ethereum\u2019s protocol are anticipated, where proto-danksharding will lead the way to full danksharding in future upgrades thereby enhancing its scalability potential even more. Secondly, the upgrade enhances Ethereum\u2019s security through measures such as adding new EVM opcodes while phasing out obsolete ones making it more attractive and reliable. Through infrastructure and capability enhancements like Dencun, Ethereum is likely to attract greater investor interest, fueling a bullish sentiment that could propel Ethereum to new all-time highs.\n\n2. ETH Burning and Staking Initiatives\n\nDune\u2019s data indicates that the amount of ETH locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake layer protocol is steadily decreasing the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Presently, over 31.68 million ETH, worth $126 billion, is staked on the Beacon Chain. This accounts for approximately 26.4% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply being staked and unavailable in the market, with more than 990,000 validators actively engaged.\n\nIn addition, the availability of liquid staking options like Lido has simplified the process of staking on the Ethereum network. Lido alone accounts for 31% of the overall staked Ether.\n\nFurthermore, recent data from ultrasound money reveals a substantial amount of ETH being burned in the last seven days, resulting in a reduction of Ether\u2019s circulating supply by 49,931 ETH, equivalent to approximately $200 million. This burning mechanism serves to decrease the selling pressure on the price by reducing the available supply of ETH in circulation. Ethereum\u2019s scarcity is amplified, driving up demand and potentially propelling its price to new heights.\n\n3. London Stock Exchange (LSE) plans\n\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has announced that it will accept Bitcoins and Ethereum applications for Crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). ETNs are investment products that track Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s value, allowing investors to trade similar to traditional stocks during regular trading hours.\n\nThe LSE has set up criteria for the ETNs including, the need to be physically backed and non-leveraged, meaning they have to have real assets backing them up, and they can\u2019t involve borrowing to amplify returns. Plus, they must be backed by Ethereum and Bitcoin and have a publicly available market price or value measure.\n\nSince Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is ready to support the creation of a market segment for these crypto-backed ETNs, the LSE\u2019s move opens up a whole new avenue for investors to acquire exposure to Ethereum through regulated channels and sleep have openly complied due to legal concerns it may attract significant attention from institutional investors and traditional financial players Hesitate to enter the crypto-space\n\nThis move by the London Stock Exchange adds legitimacy and accessibility to Ethereum as an economic asset, increasing demand and potentially increasing its value in the long term.\n\n4. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs)\n\nAnother force driving the Ethereum price to soar is the upcoming possibility of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, which faced a delay, spot Ethereum ETFs appear to be on a fast track to obtaining regulatory approval.\n\nThe successful deployment of spot Bitcoin ETFs since January 11 has set a precedent, indicating that a similar Ether-based product could attract substantial capital to ETH. This accelerated approval process for Ether ETFs has garnered significant attention from institutional investors, who may now look to diversify their holdings beyond Bitcoin. This shift in focus towards Ether ETFs could stabilize liquidity at higher price points and foster long-term price surges, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTechnical Analysis of ETH\n\nThe 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) suggests a robust buying sentiment, pointing towards a favorable trend in the short to medium run. Likewise, the 200-day EMA and SMA are both displaying an upward trend, signaling a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Meanwhile MACD levels indicate the possibility of Ethereum price appreciation, traders should be wary of overbought conditions with the RSI (14) indicating 81.8.\n\nSupport amounts: $2546.6 and $1751.5\n\nResistance: $3829.2 and $4316.7\n\nThe attainment of $4,800 by Ethereum hinges upon a confluence of technical aspects, market dynamics, and overall market circumstances. In order to make prudent investment choices within the cryptocurrency market, traders and investors must diligently engage in comprehensive research, evaluate various sources of information, and effectively mitigate risks."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Going to Surge to $5K in March? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) sees significant price growth, with expectations of reaching new highs, backed by favorable market indicators and upcoming network upgrades.\n\nSpeculation around the approval of an Ethereum ETF in the US and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event could further boost ETH\u2019s market performance.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a Matter of When\u2019\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been among the best-performing cryptocurrencies (at least from the top 10 list) in the past several weeks, with its price surging by 60% monthly and surpassing the $4,000 level for the first time since December 2021.\n\n\n\nSome analysts and key indicators suggest that the rally could continue in the near future, meaning the asset might reach a new all-time high. The popular X user Ali supports that thesis.\n\nHe believes Ethereum\u2019s path to $5,000 \u201clooks increasingly clear as resistance thins.\u201d Ali observed a chart provided by IntoTheBlock to outline the $4,522-$4,646 as a major supply zone, where almost 600,000 addresses hold more than 1.63 ETH.\n\nThe crypto analytics platform also shows that the asset\u2019s recent price appreciation has benefited investors, with approximately 95% of holders sitting on paper profits.\n\nETF Excitement and Network Upgrades\n\nThe first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States were approved earlier this year, but such a product with Ethereum as an underlying asset is still waiting for a green light from the relevant regulators.\n\nBTC seemed to be in an excitement mode following BlackRock\u2019s application to launch an ETF, and the months leading up to the approval were highly bullish. Ethereum is currently in the same build-up zone, meaning the crypto community might witness the same rally.\n\nOn the other hand, the potential launch of a spot ETH ETF in America might lead to the same immediate \u201csell-the-news\u201d event observed after the BTC ETF approvals. Recall that the correction did not last long, with the primary cryptocurrency ascending to a new all-time high earlier this week.\n\nAnother factor that could positively impact ETH\u2019s valuation in the near future is the upcoming Dencun upgrade. It is scheduled to take place this week and focuses on increasing the scalability, efficiency, and security of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDencun (combined from the words Cancun-Deneb) marks the beginning of \u201cThe Surge\u201d era in the network\u2019s roadmap \u2013 a process that follows the historical transition from Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to Proof-of-Stake, known as \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nThe BTC Halving\n\nLast but not least, we will touch upon the approaching Bitcoin halving, which is slated for next month. The event occurs roughly every four years and reduces the rate at which new BTC is mined.\n\nIt is a vital part of the asset\u2019s anti-inflationary nature and historically has been followed by an overall market resurgence. Recall that ETH hit an ATH of over $4,700 a year and a half after the previous halving.\n\nThose willing to dive deeper and learn the essential specifics of the halving, feel free to watch our dedicated video below:"

        "title": "Ethereum Unleashes Another Major Upgrade with the Dencun - Blockhead",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, is set to undergo another major upgrade on March 13, 2024. On this date, the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade goes live, ushering in a new era of functionality and, most importantly, scalability for the dominant smart contract platform.\n\n\"Dencun\" is a clever portmanteau of \"Deneb\" and \"Cancun,\" two separate upgrade proposals that have been meticulously combined to form a single, powerful update. Ethereum's dominance in the crypto space is undeniable. Its robust smart contract functionality has fueled the explosive growth of Decentralized Applications (dApps), revolutionizing everything from finance (DeFi) to gaming (NFTs). However, a dark cloud has loomed over Ethereum's success: scalability. Transaction fees have skyrocketed during periods of high network congestion, creating a major barrier to entry for new users and projects.\n\nThis is where Dencun comes in. This landmark upgrade represents a significant step forward in Ethereum's ongoing quest to address scalability woes and solidify its position as the premier platform for decentralized innovation.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals\n\nEthereum upgrades are usually built on the foundation of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EIPs outline potential new features or processes for Ethereum. They also contain technical standards and specifications for the proposed changes, acting as a credible source for the Ethereum community. These allow network upgrades to be discussed and developed through the EIP process.\n\nThe EIPs are similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), as they play a central role in how changes happen and are documented on Ethereum.\n\nThe earliest Ethereum upgrade was Byzantium in 2017 which reduced block rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH and implemented new smart contract functionalities.\n\nConstantinople and Istanbul upgrades followed in 2019. These introduced multiple EIPs that enhanced Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, optimized transaction fees and made the network more supportive of Layer 2 chains.\n\nThe transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) was started with the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 and completed with the Merge in 2022. This allowed for staking of Ether, improving Ethereum\u2019s environmental friendliness and reducing the issuance of ETH.\n\nA full history of all Ethereum upgrades can be seen here.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade\n\nDencun comes with a series of technical improvements designed to optimize Ethereum's performance with added benefits for Layer 2 networks on the blockchain.\n\nThe central feature of the Dencun upgrade is the introduction of proto-danksharding, which is contained in EIP-4844. Proto-danksharding significantly reduces data storage costs for Layer 2 rollups.\n\nThis is accomplished through \"data blobs,\" which are holders for large amounts of data associated with Layer 2 transactions. The improvement that data blobs bring is that unlike traditional transactions, they are not executed on the main chain. Instead, they are stored briefly on the main chain with a data reference included in the transaction. Blobs are available for 18 days then dropped from the network. This decreases the computational burden on the main chain, potentially reducing the gas fees for L2 rollups.\n\nBefore Dencun, Layer 2 networks had to submit all transactions to the main chain in one chunk. This limited scalability as only a specific amount of data could be handled by the main chain. After the Dencun upgrade, L2 chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and others can use data blobs to slash transaction fees on their chain.\n\nBenefits for Ethereum Users & Traders\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade brings several benefits to users and traders alike. According to statistics from IntoTheBlock, the gas fees for DEX swaps are projected to reduce on Aribitrum from $2.02 to $0.4. On Optimism, fees are projected to reduce from $1.42 to $0.28, and on Base from $0.58 to $0.01.\n\nUsers will also benefit from improved scalability with proto-danksharding allowing the Ethereum blockchain to handle a significantly higher number of transactions per second, reducing congestion and improving overall performance.\n\nLayer 2 Blockchains like Optimism and Arbitrum will also see increased adoption with improved compatibility and performance, as more developers and users seek scalable alternatives to Ethereum's mainnet. Layer 2 solutions already complement Ethereum's mainnet by offering scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. This synergy strengthens the overall Ethereum ecosystem and fosters innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other dApp sectors.\n\nLayer 2 solutions also provide a flexible scaling solution that can dynamically adjust to network demand, ensuring smooth operation even during periods of high congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Price Action\n\nWith Ethereum breaking the $4,000 price barrier and the continued growth of Layer 2 solutions, demand for ETH is projected to grow.\n\nA look at the on-chart indicators highlight the sustained inflow of capital and strong buying pressure, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings. This could see ETH hit a new all-time high, following in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) steps.\n\nETH/USDT on TradingView (Daily Timeframe)\n\nEthereum's Dencun upgrade represents another significant milestone in the blockchain's journey towards scalability, efficiency, and mass adoption. This upgrade will ensure Ethereum is poised to offer a better user experience while maintaining its position as a leading blockchain platform. Moreover, the enhanced compatibility with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum opens up new possibilities for scalability and innovation, benefiting both Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Buckle up, crypto world \u2013 the future of decentralized applications is about to get a whole lot brighter."

        "content": "Last week, bitcoin hit new records in volatile trading for the first time since 2021, before more subdued trading over the weekend.\n\nThe price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $72,022.16, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it reached an all-time high of $72,750.16.\n\nAt the same time, heightened leverage in the crypto market has led to the biggest price swings in nearly a year, with funding rates at their highest levels since January 2021 and bitcoin open interest at all-time highs.\n\nInflows into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs continue to drive the cryptocurrency's price action. Last week, crypto investment products saw record inflows totaling $2.7 billion, according to CoinShares. That put the year-to-date total at $10.3 billion, just off the record of $10.6 billion for all of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, ether broke $4,000 for the first time since December 2021, lifted in part by bitcoin. It was last higher by 3% at $4,034.00.\n\nInvestors were also looking ahead to the Ethereum network's next big tech upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun,\" this week. In the past, the crypto asset has rallied into the day of the upgrade and then seen traders sell on the event.\n\nCiti analyst Alex Saunders pointed out in a note Monday that price action could look different for Dencun given the strength of other key crypto catalysts in play at the moment \u2013 specifically, the inflows into bitcoin ETFs, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the potential that the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve trading of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. in May.\n\nCompanies whose performance is tied to the price of bitcoin was mixed on Monday. Crypto exchange Coinbase advanced gave back earlier gains but closed just under flat as the broader rally in tech cooled. Bitcoin proxy Microstrategy rose 4% after the company purchased another roughly 12,000 bitcoins for more than $821 million in cash, according to a filing.\n\nMiners fell. Marathon Digital lost 12%, CleanSpark fell 16%, Iris Energy lost 5% and Riot Platforms slipped 4%. These were some of the biggest stock market gainers in February but have turned lower for March as investors digest the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, when mining companies' revenue will be slashed.\n\nNew U.K. crypto trading products\n\nElsewhere, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said Monday that it would allow exchanges to list cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded products for the first time \u2013 two months after spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S.\n\nSpecifically, the FCA said it would not object to requests from recognized investment exchanges to create a U.K.-listed market segment for crypto-backed exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. The London Stock Exchange said it will accept applications for the admission of bitcoin and ether ETNs from the second quarter of this year.\n\nUnlike an ETF, which is a fund that holds assets, an ETN is an unsecured debt security issued by a bank. It is typically linked to a market index or other benchmark. An ETN promises to pay out at maturity the full value of the index, minus management fees.\n\nBitcoin bulls note this will lead to increased institutional investment into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They say this will, in turn, impact the price positively as more serious money floods into the market."

ETH is again moving higher as the bulls seem to be aiming for a move above the $4,200 level.\n\nEthereum traded to a new multi-month high above $4,080 before correcting lower.\n\nThe price is trading above $4,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break above a key contracting triangle with resistance at $4,025 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its increase if it clears the $4,085 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Regains Strength\n\nEthereum price spiked above the $4,000 resistance zone, like Bitcoin. ETH traded to a new multi-month high above $4,050 before there was a downside correction.\n\nThe price declined below the $4,000 level, but the bulls were active near the $3,850 zone. A low was formed at $3,830 and the price is now rising. There was a move above the $4,000 resistance. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,088 swing high to the $3,830 low.\n\nEthereum price is now trading above $4,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The next major resistance is near $4,150, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $4,280 level. If there is a move above the $4,280 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,350 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,500.\n\nAre Dips Limited In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $4,085 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,020 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,965 zone or 100 hourly SMA. The next key support could be the $3,880 zone. A clear move below the $3,880 support might send the price toward $3,830. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,740 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,965\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $4,085"

        "content": "Unibot\u2019s native token fell past $50 today.\n\nConflict has broken out between the popular Telegram bot\u2019s Ethereum and Solana developers.\n\nBoth sides traded accusations of breach of trust.\n\nUnibot\u2019s token fell more than 40% today as news emerged of infighting between its Ethereum and Solana developers of the popular Telegram trading bot with over $1.1 billion in volume.\n\nUnibot\u2019s Ethereum developers said they had ended their collaboration with their Solana counterparts, accusing them of reneging on previous agreements.\n\nThe Solana group confirmed the split, announcing plans to rebrand from Unibot\u2019s Ethereum team.\n\nUnibot is a Telegram trading bot on both Ethereum and Solana. It first emerged on the Ethereum mainnet last May, followed by a Solana deployment in January.\n\nUnibot users, especially those who use the Solana-based iteration, now find themselves in the lurch.\n\nToday\u2019s split is the latest problem to rock Unibot, which was previously hacked for $5.6 million last year. These problems have contributed to the project falling further behind its major rival, Banana Gun bot.\n\nUnibot and Banana Gun bot belong to a class of projects that allow crypto users to trade tokens using only a few simple commands on Telegram.\n\nUnibot token slumps below $50 amid in-fighting between project teams\n\nTelegram bots have evolved into a crypto niche in their own right and boast a $1.6 billion market capitalisation, according to Coingecko.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nApart from trading, several bots also share revenue with users, and some of them help traders automate airdrop farming activities.\n\nUnibot developers lance accusations\n\nThe Ethereum developers behind Unibot accused the Solana group of a breach of trust because the latter also launched a version of the bot on the Blast blockchain without its approval. Blast is a layer-two blockchain built by the same team behind the NFT marketplace Blur.\n\nUnibot\u2019s Ethereum developers accused its Solana counterparts of refusing to undergo the KYC identification process, too.\n\nAs such, the Unibot Ethereum team demanded the Solana group change its name which is currently Unibot on Solana.\n\nFollowing the split, the Unibot Ethereum developers launched a Unisol X frontend for users on Solana as an alternative to the Unibot on Solana bot. They decided to launch a second front because they are no longer working with the Solana group.\n\nResponding to Unibot\u2019s accusations, Reethmos, the pseudonymous Unibot on Solana builder, said the split would not affect its users.\n\nUnibot has earned over $53 million in revenue since inception. (whale_hunter/Dune)\n\nReethmos countered Unibot\u2019s statement and accused the Ethereum developers of engineering the split because the Solana team blocked their access to the bot\u2019s revenue.\n\n\u201cThey farmed $30 million from tax farming but apparently it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Reethmos said on X, formerly Twitter. Tax farming is the practice of levying fees on token swaps, and Unibot\u2019s Ethereum developers earn 40% of the tax imposed on trading the token.\n\nUnibot generates revenue across all chains, which is shared among token holders. To qualify for the revenue share, holders must hold at least 10 Unibot tokens.\n\nOf the $53 million in cumulative revenue the bot has generated, $48.2 million has been realised on the Ethereum deployment.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have cleared the $70,000 and $4,000 psychological levels, respectively.\n\nThis development has pushed the Fear and Greed index to extreme greed as the indicator points to 81.\n\nMajor altcoins seem to have stopped in time as they move sideways, devoid of volatility.\n\nThe cryptocurrency bull rally that started in January 2023 is going strong, with Bitcoin clearing old all-time highs (ATH) at $69,000 and Ethereum clearing the $4,000 psychological level. This cycle has caused many altcoins to grow by multiples in short durations. But as BTC dominance reaches April 2021 levels, what\u2019s next for crypto markets?\n\nAlso read: El Salvador is sitting on $84M profit from its Bitcoin holdings\n\nCrypto market sentiment screams cautiousness\n\nThe Fear and Greed Index (FGI) stands at 81, which indicates that the crypto markets are in \u201cextreme greed\u201d conditions, where potential corrections could erupt due to profit-taking.\n\nThe FGI ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), reflecting crypto market sentiment. The lower range, aka extreme fear, signals that the markets are oversold, while the upper limit indicates that a potential market correction could be around the corner.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index\n\nBitcoin dominance on the rise\n\nBitcoin dominance, the ratio of BTC\u2019s market capitalization vs. the rest of the crypto market, is currently hovering around 54.05%. In less than two months, Bitcoin dominance has risen roughly by 8 percentage points and is fast approaching a tipping point of 56.62%. This level is the midpoint of the 39.62% to 73.63% range formed in the first two quarters of 2021.\n\nTypically, a declining Bitcoin dominance suggests that investors are interested in altcoin opportunities and vice versa. The recent spike suggests that altcoin profits or new capital could be moving back to BTC. Additionally, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) accepting BTC was a factor that helped Bitcoin\u2019s price to break above $70,000.\n\nBTC Dominance\n\nThe rise in BTC dominance, while bullish for Bitcoin, could translate into a potential correction for altcoins.\n\nEvaluating potential altcoin market reset\n\nA hypothetical scenario that could occur in the next few days is that altcoins lose momentum as BTC's dominance continues to rise. This outlook could push investors to book partial profits, causing altcoins to slide lower.\n\nDogwifhat (WIF), Pepe coin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and other meme coins that noted a raging rally in the past few weeks are already correcting.\n\nEventually, this profit-taking scenario could spread to major altcoins like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Wordlcoin (WLD), and Fetch.aI (FET), pushing investors to convert their unrealized gains into profits.\n\nMeme coin performance\n\nOther considerations\n\nWhile a potential correction could be brewing, some altcoin exceptions could trend higher. These altcoins could rebel against the dominant trend and potentially rally with Bitcoin.\n\nRead more about trending altcoins here - link\n\nHere are the top three altcoins that could rebel against a potential correction and rally higher:\n\nArbitrum (ARB): The Arbitrum Gameathon, which began on Monday, has already caused gaming tokens to surge in the past week. This event will end on March 18, which means it could continue to influence gaming-related altcoins. Worldcoin (WLD): The Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem could see a massive uptrend due to the upcoming Nvidia AI conference, which will take place from March 18 to 21. Ethereum Dencun upgrade: This much-awaited upgrade will be implemented on March 13, making prices of ETH-related altcoins like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), LidoDAO (LDO) and others to shoot up.\n\nAlso more: Arbitrum Arcade launch could fuel narrative for crypto gaming tokens"

        "title": "Ethereum surges past $4,000 for the second time in its history - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price neared the $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2021 on March 8, 2024. As of March 11, it has gone past $4,000, the second time in the entire price history of Ethereum. The upward movement in Ether's price seems to be fueled by anticipation surrounding Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade and the potential approval of a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\n\nAs of writing, ETH is holding down at $4,010 and continues to be on the rise, while other major cryptocurrencies are also displaying positive sentiment, with Bitcoin at $71,085.\n\n\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, considered the most substantial enhancement to the Ethereum network since the merger, aims to incorporate several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844, which introduces \"proto-danksharding.\"\n\n\n\nProto-danksharding is a feature designed to enhance transaction processing by utilising blobs, thereby expediting transactions and reducing costs for layer-2 chains and rollups dependent on Ethereum. The Ethereum developers have scheduled the Dencun mainnet launch for March 13.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is optimism about the SEC's potential approval of spot Ether ETF applications. It's expected that the SEC will announce its decision on all spot Ether ETF applications simultaneously, similar to its approach with Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, to maintain fairness among issuers. The statutory deadline for the SEC's decision on ETFs is set for May 23.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the SEC's decision-making process for Ether ETFs won't be as prolonged as it was for Bitcoin ETFs. Drawing from the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch on January 11, a spot Ether ETF product is anticipated to attract significant capital inflow into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that institutional investors may increase their exposure to Ether once attention shifts from Bitcoin's recent all-time high to the potential of an ETH ETF. This could lead to liquidity consolidating at higher levels, potentially triggering price rallies in the long term. With the potential for increased institutional interest and capital inflow, Ethereum's position as the second-largest cryptocurrency is poised for further growth.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

Yet, the price has reached a significant level that could hold the market for a while.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been steadily rising, making higher highs and lows. The market has left the 200-day moving average far behind, a behavior typically seen during crypto bull markets.\n\nCurrently, the ETH price is trying to pierce through the $4,000 resistance level after failing to do so last week.\n\nIf the breakout occurs, ETH will likely reach a new all-time high. However, judging by the massive overbought signals on the RSI, a pullback looks pretty probable in the short term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has been consolidating below the $4,000 level for a while. Yet, the bullish momentum has seemingly kicked in again, and ETH is on the verge of blowing past the $4,000 resistance zone.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index also shows values above 50% but is still not overbought in this timeframe. Therefore, the market might still rise higher before an eventual correction.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Funding Rate\n\n\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price has yet to reach a new all-time high, market participants expect the price to rally much higher. This optimistic behavior can easily be witnessed in future market sentiment.\n\nThis chart presents the Ethereum funding rates, which indicate whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their orders more aggressively on aggregate. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, while negative values point to pessimism by market participants.\n\nThe chart demonstrates that the funding rates have been showing extremely high values recently, even higher than during the last all-time high. While this aggregate buying pressure is not inherently bad, it can lead to a potential long-liquidation cascade that could cause short-term price drops."

        "title": "With bitcoin hitting new highs, it\u2019ll likely reach the US$100,000 milestone before 2024 is out - The Conversation",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are surging again. Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high of more than US$72,000 (\u00a356,300), pushing past the level of circa US$69,000 where it turned back during its last bull phase in late 2021.\n\nOther top cryptocurrencies like ethereum and solana have reached their highest prices in three years, on the back of a run that has been going since the autumn. The value of the whole cryptocurrency market has raced up to US$2.6 trillion, triple what it was worth at the beginning of 2023 and not far off its previous US$3 trillion peak.\n\nMuch of this run has occurred at a time when the US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies (though it has fallen in the past couple of weeks). This can often be a time when cryptocurrencies get weaker, so it shows how strong they have been lately.\n\nMany other fiat currencies around the world have been losing value against the US dollar during this period, so bitcoin reached all-time highs in many of them long before it finally took out its high in the US currency.\n\nSo what has contributed to this explosion in prices and where is the market going for the rest of 2024?\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nA major driver for this appreciation in prices has been the US authorities\u2019 approval in January of an investment vehicle known as an exchange-traded fund or ETF for the general or \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin market. An ETF is an easy way for the average saver to get exposure to an asset, since they buy shares in the vehicle, usually through their financial advisor, rather than having to go to the trouble of buying the underlying asset.\n\nA total of 11 bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, and their daily trading volume has now exceeded US$10 billion \u2013 driven by frontrunners Blackrock and Fidelity Investments. This demonstrates the large interest from traditional market participants, and as the spot ETFs become more mature, their providers will offer more promotional material and education to get more customers onboard.\n\nBitcoin/US$ price\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is always adapting and innovating, and one possible future innovation is the offer of option contracts on the new spot ETFs. Options allow traders to hedge their bets on whether the crypto market will go up or down, and would likely attract even more new money into the space.\n\nHowever, US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just postponed a decision on this innovation until late April. Some experts think approval may take longer than that as it is unclear which regulatory body would be responsible for policing this new class of derivative contracts.\n\nThe bitcoin halving\n\nOne feature of the bitcoin system which was built in at the beginning is that, roughly every four years, the rewards to companies using arrays of computers to create or \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin get cut in half.\n\nThe last halving took place in May 2020, where miners went from receiving 12.5 bitcoin for each unit of work they do to 6.25 bitcoin. The next is due to take place on April 19, cutting the reward down to 3.125 bitcoin.\n\nBecause each halving means less new bitcoin coming on to the market, they have coincided with strong price appreciation in the cryptocurrency. What isn\u2019t clear is whether this is already priced in and therefore not actually the reason price is going up.\n\nOne theory is that the institutions behind the spot ETFs are buying aggressively now because they know there will be less bitcoin on the open market once the halving takes place.\n\nEthereum prospects\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto market could also be boosted by spot ETFs for the ethereum cryptocurrency system in the coming months. At least ten firms, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have applied to launch them and the SEC has until May to make a decision.\n\nWhereas the online ledger that underpins bitcoin, known as its blockchain, has been seen largely as a store of value, ethereum has become the leading blockchain for developers to write applications using this technology.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that most cryptocurrencies should be treated differently to bitcoin, as financial instruments known as securities rather than as more straightforward commodities. This adds complexity to the ethereum ETF approval process. If the US authorities were to decide it was the case, it would mean that ETFs couldn\u2019t buy ethereum from crypto exchanges until those exchanges had received approval to trade it as a security.\n\nWhile that uncertainty continues, ethereum could be boosted by the so-called Dencun upgrade (also known as Duncan or EIP-4844). Ethereum has competition from other blockchains such as solana and avalanche due to its relatively slow transaction speed and high costs.\n\nIt already completed its first major step in a long-term plan to reduce costs and cope with many more users (known as scalability) when it transitioned in 2023 to a different system for verifying transactions known as proof of stake. The Dencun upgrade, which goes live on March 13, will further improve scalability by making data storage more efficient on the network, while also lowering transaction fees.\n\nWhere next\n\nPredicting cryptocurrency prices is not for the faint-hearted. The market is very volatile, and often exceeds expectations when it goes up or down. The behaviour of individuals determines market prices and, as Isaac Newton put it, you can \u201ccalculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people\u201d.\n\nHowever, the majority of commentators expect crypto prices to keep rising over the coming months. Election years tend to be good for investments in general, while a second Trump administration would probably create a more favourable regulatory environment for crypto assets (as would a Rishi Sunak victory in the UK, however unlikely that seems at present).\n\nAs bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream and integrated with traditional assets, it isn\u2019t inconceivable that it could hit US$100,000 in 2024 \u2013 an extraordinary feat for a invention that was worth nothing as recently as 2009."

        "content": "In case you\u2019re under any illusions, crypto is back, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has given it a huge regulatory boost.\n\nThe LSE announced today that it will start accepting applications for the admission of bitcoin and ether crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the second quarter of this year.\n\nETNs are debt securities that provide exposure to an underlying asset. Crypto ETNs enable investors to trade securities that track cryptoassets on-exchange during London trading hours, and they are traded on their own dedicated trading segments.\n\nConditions for LSE admission\n\nAccording to a factsheet published by the LSE, the Exchange will only consider applications for admission in respect of Crypto ETNs where the issuer can demonstrate:\n\nThe proposed Crypto ETN is physically backed, has a reliable and publicly available market price or other value measure of the underlying, and has Bitcoin or Ethereum underlying crypto assets.\n\nThe underlying cryptoassets must be wholly or principally held in \u2018cold storage\u2019 or subject to arrangements that achieve an equivalent outcome to cold storage and held by a custodian or custodians subject to AML regulation in the UK, EU (or EEA, where equivalent laws apply), Jersey, Switzerland, or US.\n\nFurther, crypto ETNs admitted to trading on LSE are only appropriate for professionals and are only available under trading segments specifically designated as \u201cProfessional investors only.\u201d\n\nAccording to the LSE, \u201cthe exact launch date will be confirmed in due course.\u201d\n\nStill, it encourages early engagement from prospective issuers interested in admitting Crypto ETNs to trading on the Exchange.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated today that it will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a UK-listed market segment for crypto asset-backed Exchange Traded Notes (cETNs).\n\nIt specifies that:\n\n\u201cExchanges will need to continue to ensure sufficient controls are in place, so trading is orderly and proper protection is afforded to professional investors. ETNs must meet all the requirements of the UK Listing Regime, for example on prospectuses and on-going disclosure.\u201d\n\nThe LSE\u2019s move follows the SEC's approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to be listed on US exchanges in January.\n\nLead image: \"London Stock Exchange\" by jam_90s is licensed under CC BY 2.0."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent technical updates have reduced the probability of a Spot Ether ETF approval, according to analysts at Blofin.\n\nSEC\u2019s decision on Spot Ethereum ETF may not influence the breakthrough of Ether price, experts say.\n\nETF experts and crypto analysts have gradually lowered their expectations for Spot Ethereum ETF approval in the past weeks.\n\nThe possibility of an approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF has divided the Ether holder community. While there was an expectation of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) immediately after the Bitcoin ETF announcement, the enthusiasm has recently faded after Bloomberg ETF analysts significantly reduced the probability of a Spot Ether exchange-traded fund approval in May, down to 30% from as high as 70%.\n\nAnalysts at crypto trading platform Blofin state that a rejection may not have a significant impact on Ethereum price. An ETF approval or rejection may turn out to be a non-event for the altcoin\u2019s price and its holders.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price trades above $4,000 while anti-Ether political campaigns downplay spot ETH ETF\n\nEthereum ETF approval odds shrink to 30%\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, said that the odds of a Spot Ethereum ETF approval by the SEC are down to 30%, according to his recent tweets. In January, the analyst believed there was a 70% chance of ETF approval by May. Balchunas\u2019 colleague James Seyffart\u2019s prediction was at 60%-65% at that time.\n\nIn the absence of meaningful engagement from SEC officials with the ETF applicants, the initial optimism has waned. Experts continue to compare the Bitcoin Spot ETF and its preparation to the regulator\u2019s decision on the Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe regulator has held meetings with Coinbase and Grayscale, but there are no public comments. This has added to the uncertainty.\n\nAnalysts at crypto trading firm Blofin state that there are three factors that could result in the SEC\u2019s rejection of a Spot Ethereum ETF:\n\nThe Merge, a shift of the altcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nPrice manipulation risk that accompanies PoS consensus.\n\nSecuritization risk.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF approval may have no bearing on ETH price\n\nAnalysts highlight that there was a surge in whale activity and supply distribution of Bitcoin in the weeks leading up to the regulator\u2019s decision on the ETF. However, an on-chain analysis of Ethereum paints a different picture. Instead of consistent accumulation, large wallet addresses have taken profits and likely capitalized on ETH holders\u2019 enthusiasm and optimism of an ETF approval.\n\nWhale action is lacking in the sense that there is no race among large wallet holders to increase their holdings of the altcoin\u2019s supply. Glassnode data shows a gradual decline in the number of ETH wallets with a holding more than 1,000 Ether.\n\nEthereum addresses with balance greater than 1K. Source: Glassnode\n\nDerivatives traders show no excitement for Ethereum ETFs\n\nThe announcement of the Spot Bitcoin ETF application pushed the far-month option skewness of both Bitcoin and Ethereum to a peak in November 2023.\n\nOne would expect a similar effect of Ethereum ETF announcement. However, the applications did not push the bullish sentiment higher. Analysts argue that the increase spotted in the far-month skewness in February likely marks the return of liquidity to the market.\n\nEthereum Skew Active Maturities. Source: Amberdata\n\nEthereum price rally depends on multiple factors\n\nEthereum\u2019s price performance depends on multiple factors. On the one hand, analysts have identified the return of cash liquidity to the crypto market as a factor boosting Ethereum price gains. This has brought volatility back to Ether, adding to the potential for growth.\n\nThe gains in Ethereum price are likely a reflection of Bitcoin\u2019s rally to a new all-time high and the optimism among market participants. Ethereum price is inching closer to its peak in the ongoing cycle and analysts argue that a Spot Ethereum ETF approval could fast track the process. However, a rejection of the ETF applications may not result in a significant pullback since the altcoin\u2019s price depends on more variants than the decision by the regulator.\n\nAdriano Feria, a crypto analyst and trader, said that Ethereum price could recover from a rejection after a minor pullback.\n\nWhat's coming to crypto markets in the next 2-3 months:\n\n\n\n- $ETH continues to gain momentum both in $USD and relative to $BTC. $ETH bulls simply don't care if ETFs are not approved as early as May, and they will use this time to accumulate.\n\n\n\n- L2 fundamentals will pop hard after\u2026 pic.twitter.com/w2DIP24wbT \u2014 AdrianoFeria.eth \ufe0f (@AdrianoFeria) March 11, 2024\n\nDCinvestor also argues Ethereum ETF approval or rejection may have no impact on the altcoin\u2019s price in the near term."

        "content": "Crypto Price Prediction: So far in 2024, Bitcoin has been the main focus of crypto investors likely attributed to the first-time launch of Spot BTC ETF. The US SEC\u2019s green light for 11 new ETFs in January sparked a substantial influx of capital from the traditional market, significantly fueling the surge that propelled Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $72,600.\n\nHowever, analysts believe the market participant\u2019s focus may shift to the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum due to the upcoming launch of the Decun upgrade and potential approval of ETH ETF this year.\n\nadvertisement\n\nProto-dank sharding, introduced in the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, is designed to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and efficiency by improving how data is stored and accessed. It represents a precursor to full sharding technology, aiming to significantly reduce the costs associated with Layer 2 rollups, which are critical for Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nThis development will benefit Layer 2 projects by driving greater adoption and offering new opportunities for integration and innovation.\n\nAlso Read: Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin Will \u201cEat\u201d Gold, Emerging as Top Asset, Price Surges Over $72k\n\n1)Arbitrum(ARB)\n\nArbitrum is a leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aimed at improving the scalability and efficiency of Ethereum transactions. By employing Optimistic Rollup technology, Arbitrum allows for the execution of smart contracts and transactions at a lower cost and higher speed, without sacrificing Ethereum\u2019s security\n\nInsights provided by IntoTheBlock indicate a stark decrease in transaction costs for decentralized exchange (DEX) swaps. Post-upgrade, the gas fee for utilizing Arbitrum is expected to drop from $2.02 to $0.4.\n\nAs per recent chart analysis, the ARB price is witnessing a mid-term sideways trend under the influence of a triangle pattern. A recent reversal from the pattern\u2019s resistance trendline plunged the altcoin from $2.27 to $2 registering a 12.2% loss within a week,\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the Arbitrum market cap dropped to $2.5 Billion while the trading surged 10.8% to hit $763 million. A potential breakout from the triangle pattern will set the ARB price to chase the $2.42 and $3.2 price targets.\n\nAlso Read: Robert Kiyosaki Advocates Bitcoin (BTC) As US Debt Crosses $34T\n\n2)Optimism (OP)\n\nOptimism operates as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to enhance transaction throughput and reduce gas fees while maintaining security and Ethereum\u2019s decentralization principles.\n\nFollowing the Decun upgrade scheduled for March 13, Optimism will see a gas fee reduction from $1.42 to $0.28. OP, the native cryptocurrency of the network, has been witnessing a steady recovery utilizing an ascending trendline in the daily chart.\n\nAn active recovery trend has uplifted the Optimism price from $1.16 to $4.3 registering 275% growth within the five months, while the market cap surged to $4.39 Billion.\n\nThe OP price facing renewed supply pressure at $4.85 may trigger a fresh correction and plunge altcoin to potential support of $4.2 and the rising support trendline.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Ethereum ETF: What Are The Chances of Approval In May?\n\n3)StarkNet(STRK)\n\nStarkNet is a decentralized, permissionless, Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, utilizing STARK-proof technology to achieve high scalability and privacy. Developed by StarkWare, it enables the processing of transactions off-chain while leveraging the security and composability of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, the projected Dex Swap Cost for Starknet will drop from $1.16 to $0.12. Amid the Bitcoin price rally above $70000, the STRK price rebounded from $1.744 last week and hit $2.67 to register 53% growth.\n\nThe market cap of Starknet witnessed a 1.41% drop reaching $1.75 Billion, while the trading volume plunged 5.47% to hit $505 Million. A look at the traditional pivot levels indicates the STRK price may face overhead supply at $2.75 and $3.08, while the $2.248 and $1.92 can provide suitable support.\n\nAlso Read: Blackrock Brings Ethereum ETF Enthusiast on Board to Focus on Crypto Offerings\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe upcoming Decun upgrade on the Ethereum network is set to bolster scalability, fortify security, and ramp up overall network efficiency.

        "content": "Last week, Ethereum attempted a surge past $4,000 levels, however, faced selling pressure at this point and has partially retraced back. At press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price is trading 2% down at $3,866 with a market cap of $464 billion. All eyes are currently on the Etheruem Dencun upgrade scheduled to go live on the mainnet ahead of this week. However, the optimism around spot Ethereum ETF seems to waning down with time.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Approval Unlikely?\n\nFox Business Journalist Eleanor Terret shared her observations stating that optimism surrounding the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before May 23rd appears to be diminishing.\n\nadvertisement\n\nConversations with knowledgeable individuals indicate that recent meetings have been largely one-sided, with issuers and custodians actively pushing the SEC staff to expedite the process. However, it seems that the SEC staff have not been as responsive or engaged in meaningful discussions compared to their handling of spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nTerret further added that SEC chairman Gary Gensler perceives that he has already satisfied industry demands with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Furthermore, prominent anti-crypto politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren are reportedly displeased with the SEC\u2019s decision to greenlight Bitcoin ETFs and are actively opposing the possibility of Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nThe sources said: \u201cStaff has been very hard to gauge on this and we\u2019re not sure if anyone really knows what\u2019s going on in their heads. But they\u2019re going to have to start work soon if it\u2019s going to have a shot.\u201d\n\nNo Strong Correlation Between ETH spot and Futures ETF\n\nEric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg, noted that the U.S. SEC staff has not provided any feedback to the issuer of the Ethereum spot ETF application, contrasting with their involvement during the Bitcoin spot ETF evaluation.\n\nThis lack of engagement is viewed unfavorably, especially considering the notable correlation between Bitcoin spot and future ETF approvals. However, the correlation between Ethereum spot and future ETFs is not as robust, suggesting a potentially less optimistic outlook for Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum price has witnessed some pullback, analysts are optimistic about the ETH rally to continue going further. As reported, analysts see a minimum gain of an additional 25% in Ethereum all the way to $5,000. However, post the Dencun Upgrade, it will be interesting to see how the bulls sustain the momentum.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the UK financial regulation myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nThe UK\u2019s financial regulator will allow some bitcoin-linked securities to be listed on the stock market, in a softening of its tough stance on digital assets as investors around the world snap up funds investing directly in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday it would \u201cnot object\u201d to the creation of bitcoin and ethereum-backed exchange traded notes for professional investors.\n\nIssuers can apply to list notes that are linked to the bitcoin and ethereum coins on the London Stock Exchange from April. ETNs are debt securities that track an underlying asset but are traded and settled through a central market entity like a stock exchange and securities depository.\n\nThe news helped push bitcoin and ethereum higher. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, hit $72,000 for the first time while ethereum touched $4,000 for the first time since December 2021.\n\nThe UK had become one of the last major markets to hold out against the trading of crypto-related securities, even though the government has been championing the country as a potential centre for digital asset markets.\n\nIn 2021 the FCA banned crypto-related derivatives, which included exchange traded products, owing to concerns over the amount of leverage, or borrowing, available to consumers. Some operators offered as much as 100 times leverage on bitcoin.\n\nThe ban \u2014 which also covered unleveraged securities \u2014 has drawn sharp criticism from members of the crypto industry, who argue that the UK cannot become a leading market for digital assets unless retail investors are given regulated and easy routes into popular tokens such as bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is by far the most well-known crypto asset, and for it to be very difficult for the UK public to be able to buy it, how can we claim to be a crypto hub if we only offer risky ways of buying this asset?\u201d said Tim Lowe, strategic adviser at London-based institutional staking firm Attestant.\n\nRegulators in other major markets have become increasingly comfortable with investors buying crypto-linked securities, as long as the securities are in a regulated product.\n\nAt the start of the year the US approved spot bitcoin ETFs, following countries in the EU, Australia and Canada. Hong Kong has also signalled it will approve ETNs. The newly approved group of US spot bitcoin ETFs, including ones issued by BlackRock and Fidelity, have collectively pulled $10bn since their launch in January, according to crypto investment group CoinShares.\n\n\u201cWith increased insight and data due to a longer period of trading history, the FCA believes exchanges and professional investors should now be able to better establish whether crypto-ETNs meet their risk appetite,\u201d the regulator said in a statement.\n\nIt continues to believe \u201cthat crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. As a result, the ban on the sale of ETNs . . . to retail consumers remains in place.\u201d\n\nThe LSE said that securities behind the ETNs could not be leveraged. They must be kept in an offline storage vault and held by custodians subject to anti-money laundering rules in the UK, EU, Jersey, the US and Switzerland."

        "content": "On Sunday, a prominent member-turned-critic of Richard Heart\u2019s HEX community, Eric Wall, tweeted an intraday chart of HEX-on-Ethereum\u2019s collapsing price. He was dunking on Heart for allegedly causing the HEX rug pull and crypto members on X (formerly Twitter) duly dogpiled. They laughed, clicking the Like button on tweets about HEX\u2019s supposed collapse tens of thousands of times.\n\nWithin hours of Heart\u2019s tweet, HEX-on-Ethereum traded 68% lower.\n\nHEX on Ethereum, the \"immutable contract\", the \"it's just you and the code\", the \"real DeFi\" just dumped over -50% because the founder, Richard Heart, tweeted today that he doesn't like it. pic.twitter.com/OV3vDe6bSe \u2014 Eric Wall | OP_\ud83d\ude3a (@ercwl) March 10, 2024\n\nRead more: Richard Heart and the curious launch of Hex, Pulse, and PulseX\n\nIn reality, Heart didn\u2019t rugpull HEX on Sunday. Nor has the value of HEX declined over the past three months.\n\nTo explain: HEX exists on two blockchains: Ethereum and PulseChain. Heart started HEX on Ethereum but claimed to migrate his focus to PulseChain in order to spare \u2018Hexicans\u2019 from Ethereum\u2019s high fees. PulseChain, he claims, is faster and cheaper.\n\nFor context, Heart is an ex-Bitcoin maximalist who defected and created three altcoins: HEX, PLS, and PLSX. HEX is his flagship creation, featuring the ability to lock up HEX on-chain for future rewards. PLS is a fee (\u2018gas\u2019) token for the PulseChain blockchain, and PLSX is a reward token for its most popular exchange.\n\nThe SEC is currently suing Heart, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX for violating federal securities laws.\n\nHEX on two blockchains\n\nOn Sunday, when Heart endorsed HEX-on-PulseChain and disavowed HEX-on-Ethereum, the price of HEX-on-Ethereum did crash -70% intraday (-54% as of publication time). That reduced its fully diluted valuation from approximately $6.4 billion to $2.6 billion as of publication time*: a loss of $3.8 billion for HEX-on-Ethereum.\n\nHowever, the price of HEX-on-PulseChain increased on Sunday. Specifically, it rallied 11% as of publication time, up from approximately $11 billion to $12.3 billion as of publication time*: a gain of $1.2 billion for HEX-on-PulseChain.\n\nIn sum, the fully diluted market capitalization of HEX-on-Ethereum did, indeed, decline more than the offsetting rise in the fully diluted market capitalization of HEX-on-PulseChain.\n\nHowever, there are two other complicating factors that make it difficult to conclude that Heart meaningfully caused any crash in the value of HEX on Sunday.\n\nHex\u2019s price fully diluted valuation has dipped from approximately $6.4 billion to $2.6 billion.\n\nNo HEX rug pull, just a slow decline\n\nFirst of all, the launch of PulseChain coincided with a free duplication of all HEX-on-Ethereum (including unstaked and staked HEX) onto PulseChain. Any long-term holder of HEX prior to PulseChain\u2019s debut received free HEX on PulseChain. Therefore, no long-term holder can be harmed by a decline in the value of HEX on Ethereum versus PulseChain \u2014 because they own an equal number of tokens on both blockchains.\n\nSecondly, Heart has consistently emphasized the long-term nature of HEX staking. Therefore, considering a trailing period of three months rather than 24 hours, the USD value of HEX-on-Ethereum is trading flat near $0.0046. Over that same period, in contrast, the USD value of HEX-on-PulseChain has increased 60%.\n\nTherefore, on the whole, the fully diluted valuation of HEX across both Ethereum and PulseChain blockchains has actually increased by over $6 billion within three months.\n\nStill no excuse\n\nThis does not excuse, of course, the disastrous overall decline in the value of Heart\u2019s altcoins which might never regain their all-time high market capitalization of $85 billion. Nor does it excuse years of sketchy behavior of the evasive founder. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t answer questions about Heart\u2019s lavish personal expenditures or diversions of the ETH and stablecoin collateral that once backed some of the briefly stratospheric valuations of HEX, PLS, and PLSX.\n\nRead more: The SEC can\u2019t get in touch with Richard Heart, now what?\n\nTo little avail, Heart tried to point this out. Using his newly preferred nomenclature (referring to HEX-on-PulseChain as simply \u2018HEX,\u2019 despite his prior years of using \u2018HEX\u2019 in reference to HEX-on-Ethereum), Heart noted that HEX-on-PulseChain rallied 57% intraday on Sunday. That is true. Specifically, HEX-on-PulseChain has a larger fully diluted market capitalization than HEX-on-Ethereum, according to CoinGecko, which makes that 57% rally even more meaningful.\n\nRegardless, skeptics dogpiled onto posts by Eric Wall (600 likes), Pledditor (1,400 likes), Wicked (330 likes), Stacy Herbert (770 likes), Mike Alfred (320 likes), and other crypto influencers. All laughed at the supposedly predictable, inevitable rug pull of HEX that consummated on Sunday.\n\nThe problem is that the rug pull didn\u2019t actually occur yesterday. Nor over the last three months.\n\nInstead, the decline in Heart\u2019s altcoins has happened slowly \u2014 for the two and a half years since September 2021.\n\n*Note: All market capitalization and price figures use CoinGecko data as of UTC 05:49:00 UTC on Monday, March 11, 2024. There is disagreement about the circulating supply of HEX across both blockchains. For this reason, CoinGecko does not display the market capitalization for either token.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "Mon 11 Mar 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nDevelopers of Ethereum, the $200 billion crypto ecosystem, have sounded the call to arms. Their mission? To protect the millions of digital assets held on the network from the clutches of a new kind of enemy \u2013 quantum computers. The first round of this unprecedented battle for survival is fast approaching.\n\nQuantum Computers Threaten the Ethereum Blockchain\n\nA threat full of power and mystery looms on the horizon. These quantum computing monsters, still in development, could one day crack the crypto codes that secure Ethereum wallets.\n\nIn the blink of a digital eye, billions of dollars in ETH and other assets could be stolen. A digital apocalypse hovers, threatening to obliterate Ethereum as we know it. Time is of the essence to counter this technological plague before it becomes a reality.\n\nDevelopers have no choice but to act, and to do so quickly. To undertake a massive preemptive counter-attack. A decisive action to save the flagship of the crypto ecosystem before it\u2019s engulfed by the raging waters of the next quantum revolution.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s Operation Renaissance\n\nIt was Vitalik Buterin, the visionary behind Ethereum, who lit the fuse. An emergency plan will be put in place to secure the network \u2013 a hard fork of a magnitude equal to the threat it faces.\n\nThe first crucial step: to completely disable transactions from the classic wallets. Too vulnerable to quantum attacks. Instead, new \u201csmart\u201d wallets will take over. Built upon the very structure of the Ethereum blockchain, they will benefit from crypto armor resistant to the capabilities of these future quantum monsters.\n\nBut the cornerstone of this renaissance operation lies in the integration of STARK proofs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge). A mechanism that will enable users to reliably verify their ownership of assets without having to expose their private keys, even to the verification system itself. A cutting-edge cryptographic breakthrough.\n\nA transitional mechanism will also be deployed to allow holders to safely migrate their funds to this new fortified system. A renaissance that will not come without pain for users, forced to undergo a lengthy software update process. But it is a necessary sacrifice on the altar of resilience against the existential threat posed by quantum computers.\n\nToday, Ethereum once again defies the doubts of skeptics to lead the way to a new post-quantum world. Where digital ownership will withstand the onslaught of mass destruction weapons that will be quantum computers. A new era that remains science fiction for now, but towards which the leading network of the blockchain is advancing, prepared for battle.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price predictions for the coming week! - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Capital flowed out of Bitcoin, suggesting that the price might dip below $69,000.\n\nDespite increasing gains for holders, ETH\u2019s price might hit $4,500 soon.\n\nTop cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple [XRP] have had a great start to March, despite earlier predictions that the month could be bearish for the market.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin rallied to a new All-Time High (ATH) as it zoomed past $72,000 on the 11th of March,\n\nEthereum, which was once lagging, has been catching up. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of the altcoin, ETH\u2019s price gained 8.59% in the last seven days.\n\nThis performance ensured that the value rose above $4,000. Then, there is XRP, which has been a subject of controversy following Ripple\u2019s long-standing lawsuit with the U.S. SEC.\n\nBut in the last 24 hours, XRP seemed not to care about its predicaments as its price pumped 18% and almost tapped $0.74. But can the cryptocurrencies maintain this momentum in the coming week?\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s impressive performance since the year began has been connected to the surge in institutional interest through ETFs.\n\nBut the past few days have seen a spike in retail interest, indicating that the bull run might already be here.\n\nHowever, a look at the Hodler Net Position Change revealed that the high-flying price might take a chill pill. Employing Glassnode\u2019s data, we noticed that the metric had dropped into negative territory.\n\nIf the Hodler Net Position Change was positive, it would have meant that investors were accumulating BTC. But the metric being at -31.531 BTC means that holders were cashing out.\n\nIf investors continue to book profits, then Bitcoin\u2019s price might decrease.\n\nA considerable price that it could hit in the coming week could be below $69,000 which was a key resistance area. However, traders might need to watch out for institutional inflow.\n\nShould inflows from the ETFs hit new highs, then Bitcoin\u2019s price might rally to another ATH.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nFor Ethereum, AMBCrypto considered the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.\n\nAt press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 19.30%, which means that if all ETH holders sell their tokens, they would make an average gain of 19.30% profit.\n\nIn a bull market, this reading is considerably low and might imply that the altcoin was undervalued. For instance, the bull market of 2016-2017 saw the MVRV ratio rise as high as 81.6%.\n\nIn 2021, the metric also surged higher. With this state, ETH\u2019s price might rise higher in the coming week, and a 10.22% hike to $4,500 might be plausible.\n\nAnother reason for this could be a decline in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. Should this be the case, ETH might get a big share of the redistribution, which could drive the price upwards.\n\nXRP price prediction\n\nXRP seems to be enjoying the capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Previously, AMBCrypto reported how the token was struggling to rise past the $0.62 resistance.\n\nAs of this writing, the price had declined to $0.69 after initially hitting $0.71. When we considered the 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), we observed that the metric slid.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s XRP\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nDips like this indicate a sudden movement of previously idle tokens. Concerning the price, it could indicate distribution. If this continues, XRP\u2019s price might decrease to $0.65.\n\nHowever, the metric showed signs that a rising slope could be in the works. A confirmation of this slope might invalidate the bearish bias, and drive XRP toward $0.75.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "Fresh spot BTC ETFs are on the cards in the Far East.\n\nA spot ETH ETF approval might be seen first in Hong Kong, given the current developments.\n\nThe introduction of a Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETF is no longer a novel development in the United States, and it is anticipated that a spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF will soon follow suit.\n\nNevertheless, institutions in Hong Kong are currently strategizing to submit applications for both BTC and ETH ETFs. This move has the potential to attract additional capital inflow for these assets.\n\nHong Kong eyeing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs\n\nLocal reports from Hong Kong suggest that institutions in the region are actively seeking approvals for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to the reports, there is a prevailing sentiment among institutions and traders that they are lagging, especially with the United States having already approved 11 spot BTC ETFs.\n\nHowever, there are indications that this push for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in Hong Kong may expedite the approval process for spot Ethereum ETFs, potentially putting them ahead of the United States in that aspect.\n\nThe report also notes ongoing serious discussions surrounding spot ETH proposals.\n\nTen institutions have submitted applications for spot BTC ETFs. If these applications receive approval, they could contribute to the ongoing institutional fund inflow that Bitcoin is currently experiencing.\n\nFurthermore, the early approval of spot ETH applications not only brings more funds into the Ethereum market but may also influence discussions on the approval of ETH ETFs in the United States.\n\nThe current state of U.S. spot BTC ETFs\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of key metrics for the spot Bitcoin ETF on Coinglass revealed significant growth since receiving approvals.\n\nAnalyzing the flow data shows predominantly positive inflows, with only three days standing out as exceptions.\n\nThe largest outflow occurred on the 1st of March, totaling over $311 million, while the highest inflow was recorded on the 5th of March, reaching over $965 million.\n\nChart analysis indicates that the highest volume in the ETF\u2019s history occurred on the 6th of March, reaching almost $13 billion. As of press time, the volume stood at around $9.1 billion.\n\nMoreover, the spot BTC ETF\u2019s market cap has surged to over $58 billion, with Assets under Management (AUM) exceeding $55 billion at the time of the report.\n\nThese metrics collectively illustrated the notable growth and increased investor interest in the spot Bitcoin ETF market since its approvals.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum cross into new price zones\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at the daily timeframe for Bitcoin and Ethereum revealed that both assets have achieved new price levels. Bitcoin\u2019s chart showed a 2.7% increase, with the asset trading at over $70,000 at press time.\n\nThis marked the first time in over two years that BTC has reached this price level. Also, it was occurring a few months after the approval of spot ETFs in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has broken into the $4,000 price range at the time of writing. The chart showed a gain of over 3%, placing it slightly above $4,000.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, this marked the first time since 2021 that Ethereum has reached such a price level.\n\nBoth assets are currently in the early stages of their bull runs, and the potential approval of spot ETFs in Hong Kong could further propel their prices to new highs."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF: What Are The Chances of Approval In May? - CoinGape",
        "content": "With the stellar demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs within the first two months of launch, market analysts are hoping for a similar approval of spot Ethereum ETF. Top industry players like BlackRock and Fidelity have been flexing their muscles to get a spot Ether ETF in the market, however, the overall optimism surrounding this seems to be waning down.\n\nWhat Are the Roadblocks to Ethereum ETF Approval?\n\nBlofin Analysis has indicated that the likelihood of spot ETH ETFs receiving approval is considerably reduced due to factors such as the negative implications of the PoS mechanism, risks associated with price manipulation, and concerns regarding securitization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn its analysis, BIoFin explains that nearly 55% of ETH supply (about 66 million coins) is held by 1,041 addresses with over 10,000 ETH each, while retail traders own less than 45%. These major holders can heavily influence ETH network upgrades due to their stake in voting rights under PoS. The SEC has also expressed concerns regarding the same in its public filings stating:\n\n\u201c\u2026Are there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d\n\nIn contrast, BTC holders lack voting rights and their distribution is more even, with whales owning around 40% of BTC supply and about 2,100 whale addresses as of March 2024, reducing the potential for price manipulation compared to ETH.\n\nThis #Ethereum ETF cycle feels like the opposite of #Bitcoin ETF approval odds at the moment. The more we see/hear (and don't see/hear) the less optimistic I become. We're ~73 days from the deadline and there really seems to be little to no movement https://t.co/N6OpM870XF \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) March 11, 2024\n\nEthereum Options Data Doesn\u2019t Support\n\nIn the options market, potential leads have emerged. Following the announcement of the spot BTC ETFs application, both BTC and ETH far-month option skewness experienced a notable surge, peaking in November 2023. Conversely, the announcement of the spot ETH ETFs application did not prompt option traders to factor in additional bullish sentiment. The rise in far-month skewness in February is likely attributed to liquidity return rather than the ETF news, reports BioFin.\n\nHowever, the report highlights that the final decision on the approval of spot ETH ETFs will not hinder the potential breakthrough of ETH price, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn another development, Blackrock has appointed Matt Kunke, formerly a research analyst at GSR, as their Digital Assets Product Strategist. This move underscores Blackrock\u2019s efforts to enhance its cryptocurrency ETF offerings for its customers.\n\nThe ETH price has once again surged past its crucial milestone of $4,000 and eyeing further gains as the community prepares for the Dencun upgrade ahead.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "As the crypto community eagerly awaits the approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a concerning silence looms over issuers. The lack of communication from the regulator has raised doubts about the possibility of Ether ETF approvals by May.\n\nRemarking on the same, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas took to X and noted,\n\n\u201cYeah our odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%.\u201d\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cI get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time.\u201d\n\nThis shed light on the market uncertainty, revealing the downgrade chances of Ether ETF.\n\nVarious influencers with diverging perspectives\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegarpgh, Balchunas elaborated,\n\n\u201cThe main thing is the fact that we\u2019re 73 days from the final deadline, and there\u2019s been no contact or comments from the SEC to the issuers. That\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Balchunas highlighted SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s stance on Ether, suggesting it could influence the decision-making process.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Gensler thinks Ether is a security. He would not want to approve it unless he thought it to be a commodity like Bitcoin. All of this little stuff adds up.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store also took to X, and expressed his confusion regarding the SEC\u2019s decision,\n\n\u201cIf SEC isn\u2019t engaging w/ prospective issuers on their filings, that\u2019s clearly a negative sign.I\u2019m looking for a logical take on the \u201cwhy\u201d here.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Matt Corva, the general counsel at ConsenSys, suggested, that the denial of an ETH ETF could yield positive outcomes in the long run. He expressed,\n\n\u201cIf ETH goes, they get crushed by their political handlers and they have no arbitrary ground left to battle against other coins \u2014 this is a great thing,\u201d\n\nWhat lies ahead?\n\nOn 6th March, key industry players like Coinbase and Grayscale held talks with SEC officials regarding rule changes for spot Ether ETFs. Despite initial optimism, analyst Balchunas, echoing insights from VB Capital\u2019s Scott Johnsson, presents a cautious view.\n\nLooking ahead, the U.S. election day stands as a critical juncture for regulatory shifts. While uncertainties persist, Balchunas remains steadfast in his belief in an eventual approval for spot Ether ETFs."

This is reinforced by the fact that the majority of BTC holders are not selling. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is also showing strength, holding above $4,000 while Ripple (XRP) price outdoes itself with double-digit gains.\n\nAlso Read: Large corporations, major wirehouses gearing up to buy Bitcoin: Bitwise\n\nBitcoin price eyes $80,000\n\nBitcoin price could make a 10% climb to the $80,000 psychological level after a bullish breakout above the $70,000 threshold. Markets remain broadly optimistic seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position, still ascending despite BTC being massively overbought. Notice the RSI has not confirmed that BTC is ripe for selling.\n\nIf bullish momentum increases, Bitcoin price could extend north to the forecasted $80,000 target. This being the first time the market is witnessing this kind of buying frenzy among institutional players for an asset with limited supply, so much so that a bull market appears to have commenced months ahead of the BTC halving, just how far the price can go remains anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nWe\u2019ve never seen #Bitcoin reach a new all-time high before the halving.\n\n\n\nWe have never seen billions of institutional money flow into #Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThere has never been so many states looking to pass pro #Bitcoin laws .\n\n\n\nDo not blink. History is happening right before your eyes. \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) March 11, 2024\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if traders begin to book profits on the gains made so far, Bitcoin price could pull back, first losing the immediate support at $69,000. An extended fall would plunge BTC price back into the supply zone between $62,278 and $65,618. A break and close below the midline of tis order block at $64,044 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: Next target for BTC is $80K after LSE and MicroStrategy announcements\n\nEthereum price could reclaim its all-time high\n\nEthereum price is up almost 85% since the start of the year and does not show any signs of stopping. ETH bulls maintain a strong presence in the market, represented by the deep green shade of this histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO). The RSI is also northbound, showing rising momentum with the primary trend growing stronger as shown by the volume indicator.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see Ethereum price extend the gains past the $4,500 threshold before reclaiming its $4,868 peak, levels last tested on November 10, 2021. Such a move would denote a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if seller momentum increases, Ethereum price could retract to provide another possible buying opportunity around the $3,602 support level.\n\nAlso Read: ETH beta plays heat up this week as Ethereum Dencun Upgrade goes live on Gnosis\n\nRipple price eyes $0.8000 milestone\n\nRipple price has gone parabolic, gaining nearly 20% over the last day. This has seen XRP price record a multi-month high of $0.7440. Judging from the RSI position, there is still more room before the payments token can be considered overbought. Also, the AO histogram bars remain in positive territory, flashing green to show the bulls are in the lead.\n\nEnhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price nick the $0.8000 psychological level, or in a highly bullish case, extend the gains to shed a zero and tag the $1.0000 key milestone. This would denote a 38% move north above current levels.\n\n\n\nXRP/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flip side, a drop below the $0.6421 support is likely to invalidate the bullish thesis, giving the bears a chance to recover the market.\n\nAlso Read: XRPLedger\u2019s AMM activation could have a positive effect on Ripple, XRP"

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen its price hover stubbornly below the $4,000 mark in recent days, despite registering over 10% gains in the past week. This consolidation phase has analysts pondering whether it\u2019s a healthy pause before further ascension or a sign of a potential correction.\n\nETH/USD Technical Analysis Paints a Mixed Picture\n\nLooking at the ETH/USD technical indicators:\n\nResistance: The immediate hurdle for ETH bulls lies at the $3,850 level. A decisive break above this point could propel the price towards $4,000 and potentially higher.\n\nSupport: The first line of defense in case of a pullback sits at $3,740. A clear breach below this level could see ETH revisit the $3,650 zone or even the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally, around $3,550.\n\nMoving Averages: The 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are currently acting as dynamic support for ETH prices, indicating a short-term bullish bias.\n\nMomentum Indicators: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the hourly chart is losing some momentum in the bullish zone, suggesting a potential slowdown in the upward trend. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains above 50, signifying that the market isn\u2019t yet overbought.\n\nPossible Reasons for Consolidation in Ethereum Price\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to ETH\u2019s current consolidation:\n\nProfit-taking: After a significant weekly rally, some investors might be taking profits, leading to a temporary price pullback.\n\nWider market correction: If the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a correction, ETH could be dragged down along with it.\n\nMacroeconomic factors: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising interest rates, could dampen investor sentiment across riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nLatest Developments to Know Before Trading Ethereum\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Approval Delays: Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret reported diminishing optimism surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs by May 23rd. Her sources suggest a lack of engagement from the SEC staff compared to Bitcoin ETF applications. Additionally, prominent anti-crypto politicians are reportedly opposing Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Quantum Readiness: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed confidence in the platform\u2019s ability to counter a potential quantum computing attack through a hard fork and new transaction types. This would involve a network rollback and user software updates to protect existing wallets.\n\nDeFi Resurgence: The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has seen a significant uptick, reaching a $100 billion total value locked (TVL) for the first time since May 2022. Ethereum maintains its dominance in DeFi with a 59% market share. Lido, an Ethereum-based staking protocol, remains the leader with $39 billion TVL.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe next few days will be crucial for determining the direction of ETH\u2019s price. A sustained break above $3,850 could signal a continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a drop below $3,740 with increasing selling pressure could indicate a more significant correction."

Dencun will reduce Layer 2 transaction fees and involve \u201cblobs\u201d and \u201cProto-dank sharding.\u201d On Monday, Ethereum punched above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021. This new cycle high has happened even in the face of the perceived diminishing likelihood of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the SEC.\n\nOver the past week, the probability of the Ethereum ETF being approved has been declining even as the asset has continued to soar. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, estimates the odds of the 23 May deadline being approved now stand at 30%. This is a decline from his 70% January estimate. Balchunas\u2019s pessimism, he claims, stems from the lack of comments and interaction from the SEC regarding the filings so far. The Bitcoin ETFs took multiple edits and refilings along with meetings with the regulator to get the process over the finish line. In an attempt to aid the process, Coinbase met last week with the regulator to advocate for the spot ETF. They demonstrated the potential lack of manipulation and the strong correlation to the futures ETF. However, we are still 71 days away from the 23 May deadline. This is a lifetime in crypto, but maybe not in the traditional finance world where filings, regulatory bureaucracy and politics are involved.\n\nRegardless of the ETF\u2019s approval, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are improving each day. According to The Block, active addresses have increased to over 500,000 \u2013 their highest since December 2022. Last week also saw Ethereum\u2019s revenue breach $200 million for the first time since May 2022. Today\u2019s Dencun Upgrade also aims to make layer 2s more usable. The Block also estimates the Dencun Upgrade will considerably lower DEX swap gas fees. Aribitrum\u2019s fees will be reduced from $2.02 to $0.4 and Base\u2019s will be reduced significantly from $0.58 to $0.01. The declining costs will potentially drive more cost-conscious participants onto Ethereum Layer 2s and away from Ethereum\u2019s arch-nemesis \u2013 Solana. With both the overall crypto market outlook and Ethereum fundamentals improving, maybe denial of the Ethereum ETF wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world for the asset. 71 sleeps to go."

The positive momentum in the market is attributed to growing interest in Bitcoin spot ETFs and the approaching Bitcoin Halving event, which has historically impacted the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been up by 250% since the past year. There has been a steady rise of mainstream acceptance and investments from both retail and institutions since the Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The next resistance is at the $76,000 level. On the other hand, Ethereum also surged above the $4,000 level rising 174% in the past year.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cCrypto markets continue to surge amidst volatility. The overall M.Cap has ballooned over $2.8 trillion, with all-time highs of Crypto M.Cap now in sight at just above $3 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC, +4.5%) was able to successfully move past the $70k resistance level, and now trading near the $72k mark. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH, +4.7%) moved past the $4k level and now trading above this level. The broader market is in the green, while the fear and greed index continues to be in the \u2018Extreme Greed\u2019 signifying a very strong investor sentiment.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin's Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) volumes continue to uplift market sentiment, driving the token to an all-time high amid increased adoption. Despite awareness of potential pre-halving corrections, investors maintain optimism regarding the token's price trajectory. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin's Hull Moving Average has transitioned into a 'Buy' sentiment, coinciding with significant gains in Litecoin, Ripple, and STX. While uncertainties linger around Ethereum ETFs, the token is witnessing gains as part of the broader market surge, showcasing resilience and positive momentum. Investors remain attentive to developments in this dynamic market landscape.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cInstitutional involvement, exemplified by BlackRock's large bitcoin holdings and the SEC's approval of ETFs, is reshaping the bitcoin story. As BlackRock's ETF outperforms MicroStrategy's holdings, institutional interest is driving Bitcoin's rise. MicroStrategy remains committed to strengthening its Bitcoin reserves, reflecting the company's growing belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's current rise to $72,500 underscores its market dominance, with technical indicators pointing to a bullish trend. Resistance levels at $73,824, $76,749 and $79,904 pose challenges, while support levels at $67,154, $64,861 and $62,192 offer cushions against downside. Despite potential overbought conditions, Bitcoin's break above $70,000 and bullish candlestick patterns indicate an upward trajectory, with a target above $73,800. The 50-day EMA at $66,860 reinforces this bullish sentiment and suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin above $72,200.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's price surpassed $72,000 on Monday, creating a new ATH at $72,800. The largest cryptocurrency now has a total market cap of $1.4T, surpassing silver to become the world's eighth most valuable property. MicroStrategy purchased an additional 12,000 BTC for approximately $821.7 million in cash. This takes MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings to over 205,000 BTC. The crypto market continues to demonstrate remarkable growth and adoption worldwide.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, the crypto market remained bullish as BTC surged to a new all-time high of $72,800 and ETH reached a new yearly high. Alts also experienced significant upside moves. BTC's stability at this high level indicates strong underlying strength, with futures open interest also rising sharply. This stability in BTC led to 5-10% gains in altcoins, with Layer 1 tokens leading the charge. ETH nearly touched $4,100 and is currently consolidating around that level. Additionally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing major support, suggesting that ETH may take the lead in the near term. The next key level for ETH to watch is $4,380.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Further, the price of Bitcoin successfully achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of just over $70,000 on 08th March.\n\nThe leader of altcoins, Ethereum (ETH), has added over 14% to its portfolio during the previous week. Ripple (XRP) token on the other hand has successfully recovered its losses during this week, indicating an increase in the bullish influence within the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC):\n\nThe market leader, Bitcoin, traded in a closed range between $47,705 and $50,540 for a while, following which the bulls recorded a jump of 9.35%. However, the price faced rejection at $52,853, after which the price traded sideways for the next twelve days. As the market volatility grew, the BTC price jumped 27% within the next two days.\n\nAfter displaying a neutral trend for five days, the BTC token jumped 11.33%, recording a new ATH. Following this, the bulls lost momentum and recorded a correction of over 10%. The bulls quickly regained momentum, resulting in a bounce back in the chart.\n\nTradingView: BTC/USDT\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a constant flatline in the chart, indicating a neutral trend for the coin in the crypto market. Further, the averages show a similar trend, indicating an uncertainty in future price action.\n\nIf the bulls hold the price above the support level of $68,296, the price will continue to gain momentum and attempt to test its upper level of $72,000 during the coming week. However, a negative trend reversal may pull the price toward its support level of $64,287.\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n\nThe Ethereum price displayed a neutral trend for a while, after which the market gained momentum and the ETH token recorded a jump of over 8% in value. After trading sideways for a while, the bulls regained momentum and the price jumped 22.5% over the next five days.\n\nFollowing this, the price traded sideways for the next few days. After testing its low of $3,176, the ETH price regained momentum and recorded a jump of over 24% and since then the price has been trading in a closed range.\n\nTradingView: ETH/USDT\n\nThe technical indicator, MACD, displays a rising red histogram, indicating an increase in the selling pressure in the market. Moreover, the averages show a bearish convergence, suggesting the price may continue losing value in the coming time.\n\nIf the market pushes the ETH price above the resistance level, the bulls will regain momentum and prepare to test its upper resistance level of $4,200 in the coming days. Conversely, if the bears overpowered the bulls, the price would lose momentum and fall to test its support level of $3,533.\n\nRipple (XRP):\n\nThe XRP price traded in a consolidated range between $0.530 and $0.5626 for a brief period during which the token displayed significant volatility in its price. As the bulls regained momentum, the Ripple price added approximately 25% over the next seven days.\n\nUpon facing rejection at $0.6624, the Ripple token traded under a bearish influence and recorded a correction of 14% in valuation. After testing its low of $0.5626, the XRP price recorded a jump of 11.80%. Since then, it has been attempting to break out of its important resistance level at $0.6290.\n\nTradingView: XRP/USDT\n\nThe MACD shows a neutral trend in the histogram, highlighting a weak buying and selling pressure in the market. However, the averages show a bullish convergence, suggesting a mixed sentiment in the crypto industry.\n\nIf the market holds the XRP price above the support level of $0.6290, the bulls will continue to gain momentum and prepare to test its upper resistance level of $0.680 by the coming weekend. Negatively, a bearish trend may pull the price toward its lower support level of $0.583."
