        "content": "Bitcoin is still down on 21-month highs set directly after the SEC bungled its spot ETF announcement on Tuesday. Ethereum, on the other hand, is way up.\n\nEther (ETH) has rallied more than 16% in that time and is now easily the year-to-date best performing top-20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin (BTC) is so far in second-place, with about half those returns.\n\nMarkets sold the news one day early due to the SEC\u2019s unauthorized announcement and appear to have simultaneously bought the rumor on ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) \u2014 the original Ethereum hard fork in 25th position \u2014 is however having a moment. The blockchain\u2019s native token ETC has spiked nearly 50% over the past day.\n\nDue to the timing, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any real rhyme or reason for ETC to be climbing so quickly.\n\nThe devil\u2019s advocate would say that Ethereum Classic is gearing up for a hard fork later this month tipped to better align the network\u2019s EVM with Ethereum\u2019s, which could help inspire projects to work with the chain.\n\nAnd the network\u2019s hashrate did spike to all-time highs following Ethereum\u2019s switched to proof-of-stake in late 2022, as former ETH miners sought a substitute revenue stream at which to direct their GPU mining rigs.\n\nEther has jumped from $2,200 to $2,650 this week. Ethereum Classic has gone from $20 to $30.\n\nMuch of Ethereum Classic\u2019s post-Merge hashrate has stuck around, despite the network only seeing around 30,000 in transactions per day (about the baseline for Bitcoin Cash).\n\nFor scale, Litecoin is currently processing more than half a million transactions per day (boosted by the network\u2019s own brand of inscriptions) while Ethereum mainnet handles about twice as much, per BitInfoCharts.\n\nStill, Ethereum Classic only boasts less than 15% of Ethereum\u2019s hashrate recorded just before the Merge.\n\nETHPoW, the hard fork of Ethereum from around the Merge meant to compete with Ethereum Classic, currently has about one-tenth of the latter\u2019s hashrate.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Still Deciding What To Do With ETHPoW\n\nIn fact, until yesterday\u2019s formal SEC approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, ETC had returned nothing over the past year.\n\nThe more likely explanation is that traders are looking to frontrun the next big media narrative around crypto: the SEC approving spot bitcoin ETFs means an eventual greenlight for spot ether funds.\n\nDue to illiquid markets, dumb money or widespread left-curving, Ethereum Classic has tagged along for the ride but ended up dominating ether for gains over the short-term.\n\nGrayscale does already sell exposure to the token through one of its trusts, and the firm is now set to convert its $29 billion bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nSome reckon fund issuers might soon seek approval for ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, including XRP and solana.\n\nThe odds of fund issuers lining up to launch ETFs for Ethereum Classic are slim.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Predictions for 2024: Comprehensive Insights with MEXC Research - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "MEXC\n\nSingapore , Jan. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement, especially after the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. This development has significantly sparked interest in Ethereum-based tokens, leading to a notable surge in their value. Ethereum's price, in particular, has reached its highest point since May 2022. Investors are optimistic about the possibility of an Ethereum (ETH) ETF receiving SEC approval, contributing to this upward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding to enthusiasm, Vitalik Buterin's recent proposal to increase Ethereum's gas limit further fueled the surge, with Ethereum's price surpassing the $2,600 mark for the first time since May 2022. This has set a promising stage for Ethereum price climbing towards the $3,000 milestone.\n\nTechnical analysis using Bollinger Bands on the daily timeframe supports this bullish perspective. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,655, having moved above the upper Bollinger Band at $2,539, indicating a shift to bullish market momentum.\n\nTo reinforce the prediction of Ethereum reaching $3,000, a significant challenge must be overcome: breaking through the psychological resistance around $2,800. Successfully navigating past this point could pave the way for Ethereum to hit the anticipated $3,000 mark.\n\nMEXC Research's collection of market insights reveals substantial growth in Ethereum markets, driven by strong buying interest. This trend suggests a possible broader upward trajectory in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum poised to benefit significantly from this momentum.\n\nRenowned experts have weighed in with their predictions for Ethereum's price in 2024:\n\n\u2022 Anthony Sano's Optimistic Forecast: Predicting Ethereum to reach an impressive $10,000 by 2024, Sano emphasizes Ethereum's unique staking feature and the likelihood of an Ethereum ETF introduction, which he believes will attract institutional investors.\n\n\u2022 Rekt Capital's Analysis: Suggesting a 22% increase, Rekt Capital believes Ethereum could surpass $2,600 if it maintains firm support at $2,274.\n\n\u2022 FieryTrading's Bullish Trend Prediction: Ethereum has maintained a bullish trend for over 1.5 years, according to FieryTrading, with the potential to reach $5,000 by late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\u2022 Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou's Long-term View: The JPMorgan Managing Director highlights Ethereum's potential, especially with the \"Protodanksharding\" upgrade, projecting a price towards $8,000 by 2026 and possible outperformance over Bitcoin in 2024.\n\n\u2022 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe's Forecast: Anticipating a correction to around $1,900, followed by a rise to $3,400-$3,800 in early 2024.\n\n\u2022 Credible Crypto's Ambitious Predictions: Predicting ETH could reach a minimum of $10,000 and possibly soar to $20,000 in 2024, representing a substantial increase from its current value.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupporting these optimistic forecasts, data from Santiment Information indicates a significant increase in Ethereum accumulation by top holders. The top 150 self-custody wallets now hold a record-breaking 56.25 million ETH, demonstrating considerable confidence in Ethereum's future.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum's price predictions for 2024, as compiled by MEXC Research, range from a conservative estimate of $6,000 to a striking $10,000, heavily influenced by market sentiment and the anticipated introduction of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A deeper dive reveals why Ethereum remains an overlooked gem in the crypto market.\n\nTo say Ethereum (ETH 0.21%) is down would be exactly correct. However, when considering the gains made among its peers during 2023, its 90% increase makes it feel like Ethereum more or less watched from the sidelines while other cryptocurrencies had triple-digit percentage gains.\n\nGiven its position as the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market, it seems unnatural for Ethereum not to have had a more considerable jump. But all this means is that Ethereum has some catching up to do in 2024. Here's why Ethereum remains an attractive buy.\n\nThe smart contract pioneer\n\nEthereum's launch in 2015 altered the trajectory of crypto forever. Its novel smart contract functionality provided the foundation for developers to create innovative applications of blockchain technology that have now become common. Without Ethereum, things like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and much more would not exist.\n\nAlthough newer cryptocurrencies like Solana and Avalanche provide similar or even superior capabilities today, Ethereum remains the clear-cut leader of decentralized innovation. Several metrics demonstrate Ethereum's dominance over hopeful competitors, but two in particular highlight just how tight the original smart contract blockchain's grip on the market remains.\n\nThe undisputed champion of the decentralized economy\n\nFirst is total value locked (TVL). Quantifying the total value of assets currently staked or locked in a particular blockchain, TVL is a metric used to compare the amount of liquidity within varying DeFi ecosystems. The thinking goes that the greater the TVL, the more robust and valuable a blockchain is. As a disclaimer, this statistic has some limitations, but it does a good enough job of leveling the playing field to make comparisons.\n\nToday Ethereum's TVL is worth roughly $31 billion and accounts for 55% of the TVL across all blockchains with DeFi capabilities. Solana has just $1.3 billion in TVL, and Avalanche has $856 million.\n\nThe distance separating Ethereum from competitors undoubtedly results from its first-mover's advantage. As the first smart contract-capable blockchain, it was the only option for quite a while. Yet even as competing blockchains have joined the DeFi race and attracted significant hype, none has been able to challenge Ethereum where it matters most.\n\nFollow the developers\n\nGoing beyond TVL, assessing the number of active developers provides valuable insights into a cryptocurrency's potential. Developers are key players, responsible for creating applications, fixing issues, and introducing new features -- all critical for the sustained success of a blockchain.\n\nYet again, Ethereum shines. As of the latest count in October 2023, Ethereum had twice as many active developers as Polkadot, and nearly three times more than Solana.\n\nEthereum's extensive developer community is arguably its most valuable asset, giving it a significant competitive advantage over other blockchains. With developers involved in day-to-day maintenance, further upgrades, and exploring new use cases, Ethereum is typically the top choice for new projects seeking a reliable blockchain.\n\nMost importantly, a robust developer community not only ensures long-term viability, but also attracts more projects. Since the value of most cryptocurrencies is tied to their utility, a blockchain supporting numerous use cases often commands a higher price.\n\nEthereum's value proposition today\n\nConsidering its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum simply holds too many advantages compared to other blockchains not to be a leader in the crypto market this year. With an expansive and flourishing ecosystem of tokens, decentralized exchanges, NFTs, stablecoins, and much more, Ethereum provides investors with unparalleled exposure to the burgeoning landscape of decentralized finance.\n\nAs it currently stands, Ethereum remains almost 50% off its all-time high of nearly $4,900. Considering its position as a DeFi leader and the likelihood of a looming crypto bull market, Ethereum holds plenty of upside for the upcoming year. While the rest of the crypto market focuses on newer or more glamorous blockchains, don't forget about Ethereum. It still has plenty of room to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum Nodes and Clients Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Types of Ethereum Nodes\n\nThe Ethereum Node system functions according to the Point-to-Point network architecture. Three varieties of nodes exist:\n\nFull Nodes: A full node is tasked with the verification and validation of every transaction occurring within the network, in addition to upholding the blockchain\u2019s state. In the event of a smart contract transaction, full nodes proceed to execute every instruction contained within the smart contract. It ascertains whether the execution of the smart contract is yielding the anticipated outcomes. Each of these nodes upholds an exact replica of the blockchain data.\n\nIt continues to receive locally stored duplicates of the entire blockchain, including its own transactions and retains the most recent transaction state. In the event of a smart contract transaction, full nodes proceed to execute every instruction contained within the smart contract. It ascertains whether the execution of the smart contract is yielding the anticipated outcomes.\n\nLet us consider a scenario in which individual A conducts a transaction with individual B, which is subsequently appended to the blockchain. Subsequently, the full nodes examine the transaction to ensure that it adheres to all Ethereum specifications. If the transaction fails to comply, they either append the specification to the blockchain\u2019s current state or remove it. A transaction involving a discarder occurs when one individual transfers X ETH to another, but the recipient\u2019s account now contains a lesser amount of ETH.\n\nArchive Nodes: Archive nodes are full nodes that have been configured with the \u201carchive mode\u201d option. In contrast to Full Nodes, which solely retain the most recent transaction state, Archive nodes preserve the complete blockchain history, commencing from the genesis block.\n\nWhen requiring blocks anterior to the most recent 128 blocks, the Archive node is utilised. For instance, an archive node is necessary to utilise functions such as eth_getBalance of a historic address and to interact with smart contracts that were initiated in an earlier stage of the blockchain.\n\nArchive Nodes require more than 6 Terabytes of disc space due to their unique characteristic, whereas Full Nodes require only about 500 Gigabytes. Thus, it can be deduced that archive nodes are not practical for the general public; however, they prove to be advantageous when it comes to wallet vending, block perusing, and chain analytics.\n\nLight Nodes: A light node, in contrast to a full node, retains solely the block header and not the complete current blockchain state. It is appropriate for devices with limited memory and computational power, as the maintenance of a light node requires minimal hardware investment, operating expenses, and technical expertise. Full nodes are required for light nodes to operate. These nodes are not required to perpetually operate or transfer substantial volumes of data to and from the blockchain. It offers a straightforward method for creating a wallet, particularly for novices. Solid-state drives, for instance, are financially incapable of storing the gigabytes of data that other nodes consume. However, it is indisputable that light nodes have certain limitations; for instance, the availability of the light wallet provider during critical periods cannot be guaranteed.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum Client?\n\nA software application that implements the Ethereum specification and establishes connections with other Ethereum clients via a peer-to-peer network is known as an Ethereum client. Inter-client communication on Ethereum is feasible provided that each client adheres to the reference specification and predefined communication protocols. Although these numerous clients are developed using different programming languages and by different teams, they all \u201cspeak\u201d the same protocol and comply with the same regulations. They are consequently capable of interacting with and operating on the identical Ethereum network.\n\nThese exchanges occur among numerous clients in the network utilising programming languages such as Erigon (Go/Multi), Geth (Go), OpenEthereum (Rust), and Nethermind (C#,.NET). The Ethereum protocol, represented by the yellow paper, enables any user to execute a client and create a node.\n\nThe formal prerequisites that constitute the Ethereum blockchain set it apart from the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Core does not establish standardized behaviours that are mandatory for all Ethereum clients, in contrast to Ethereum. By utilizing a straightforward programming language and standardized documentation, Ethereum\u2019s specifications enabled the blockchain to support non-interoperable software implementations of its clients.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Clients\n\nThere are three types of Ethereum Clients:\n\nFull Client: Full clients store the entire Ethereum blockchain, which, according to the most recent estimates, requires more than one terabyte of disc space and may take several days to synchronize. Complete clients facilitate the ability of interconnected nodes to perform every network operation, such as mining, validating transactions and block headers, and executing smart contracts.\n\nLight Client: Ethereum clients are not always required to retain all data; therefore, developers frequently employ \u201clight clients\u201d when data storage and performance are critical. Light clients offer only a fraction of the capabilities of full clients. By virtue of not retaining the complete Ethereum blockchain, light clients are capable of facilitating expedited delivery while simultaneously liberating space for data storage.\n\nThe functionality of a light client is modified to suit the Ethereum client\u2019s requirements. For instance, light clients are extensively implemented in wallets for the purpose of preserving private keys and Ethereum addresses. Moreover, they oversee the broadcasting of transactions and smart contract interactions. In addition to exchange rate data and web3 instances embedded within JavaScript objects, light clients are also advantageous for Dapp browsers.\n\nRemote Client: A light client and a remote client are comparable. A key differentiation lies in the fact that a remote client does not maintain an independent copy of the blockchain or perform transaction or block header validation. In contrast, remote clients are solely dependent on a full or lite client in order to establish communication with the Ethereum blockchain network. The primary function of these clients is to operate as wallets for transaction transmission and reception.\n\nEthereum Node vs Ethereum Client\n\nEthereum Node Ethereum Client A machine running Ethereum client software is referred to as an \u201cEthereum Node\u201d. A client is an Ethereum implementation that validates all transactions in each block, ensuring the network\u2019s security and data accuracy. The three types of Ethereum Nodes are Full, Light, Archive, and Miner Nodes. The three types of Ethereum Clients are Full, Light, and Remote Clients. The Ethereum node operating system allows us to access the internet. The Ethereum client computer allows a user to access the node operating system.\n\nConclusion\n\nDelving into the intricate world of Ethereum nodes and clients reveals the backbone of this groundbreaking blockchain network. Nodes serve as the decentralized pillars, ensuring the network\u2019s resilience, security, and decentralization. On the client side, the diverse array of Ethereum clients, showcases the flexibility and openness of the Ethereum ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to evolve and transition, understanding the nuances of nodes and clients becomes increasingly crucial."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.BF= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 U.S. Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler fired warning shots to the crypto industry, casting doubt over whether digital coin ether would follow next in the footsteps of bitcoin to receive approval for an exchange-traded fund. After the bitcoin ETF approval, prices for ether \u2014 the token linked with Ethereum \u2014 spiked to their highest level since May 2022. That was because investors are betting on an ether \u2014 or ETH \u2014 ETF to be rubberstamped by the SEC next. The agency is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale.\n\nThe SEC has long been an opponent of cryptocurrencies, and its bitcoin ETF approval in no way changed its stance in a big way. After the ETF decision, Gensler issued a statement in which he called bitcoin \"speculative\" and said it could be used for \"illicit\" purposes. One comment poured cold water over hopes of an ETH ETF. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities,\" Gensler said Wednesday after the SEC decision on the ETFs.\n\nCrypto as commodities or securities?\n\nA long-running debate in the U.S. is over whether cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or as commodities. Key to Gensler's comments was his reference that bitcoin's status as a \"non-security commodity\" was one of the reasons why the SEC was comfortable approving the ETF. Gensler made clear that \"the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\" in the SEC's view. This complicates matters for an ETH ETF. \"One distinction which I think people have to look at which is that bitcoin clearly has been bucketed as a commodity, Ethereum, there's still some question. Is it a security? Is it a commodity? And I think until that's resolved, it cannot be look at exactly like the bitcoin product, in terms of how do you structure and ETF around it,\" Bill Tai, chairperson of Aktai, told CNBC in an interview at the Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz. Tai said that approving an ETH ETF is \"not as clear cut\" as was the case of bitcoin. \"I do think that it's not out of the range of possibility, but there are additional factors to consider around that one because of its classification,\" Tai said. Securities and commodities are regulated under different laws and by different agencies.\n\nWill an ETH ETF happen this year?\n\nCommentators are split on when an ETH ETF may come to the market. Some, like Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Nexo, think it will happen this year. \"I'd watch what the SEC does and not what it says, because it wasn't long ago that the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF seemed like a distant dream. Things move very fast in crypto and investors are front-running what they believe to be the next big spot ETF approval,\" Trenchev told CNBC by email. \"You'd have to say now that bitcoin has knocked down the door it's only a matter of when not if others will follow \u2014 most likely in 2024 \u2014 and ETH is definitely the leader of the pack.\" Christopher Giancarlo, co-founder of the digital dollar project and former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, oversaw the introduction of bitcoin futures in 2017. He said that, in his experience at the regulator, the approval of one product opens the doors for others. \"Once we greenlighted bitcoin futures, there as a tremendous movement in the CFTC jurisdiction area for greenlighting ethereum futures and that did come 18 months later,\" Giancarlo told CNBC on Thursday. He added that he would be \"shocked\" if there weren't growing demand for an ether ETF. \"The SEC's going to have deal with the growing demand for that product,\" Giancarlo added. Others are a little more skeptical that the SEC could approve an ETH ETF in the short term.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Two Powerful Blockchain Platforms of the Future: Ethereum and Solana - Paxos",
        "content": "Blockchain, once overlooked in the shadow of cryptocurrency, is now a powerhouse player in its own right with implications far beyond the financial sector. From improving supply chain integrity to facilitating transactions for a wide range of digital assets, its use cases are vast and varied.\n\nBut what lies at the heart of this innovative technology, and how can it be harnessed? It is helpful for enterprises across many industries to understand the fundamentals of blockchain and how key platforms like Ethereum and Solana are leading the charge in this technological revolution.\n\nWhat is blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is digital ledger technology that documents transactions across a network of computers. It can log and track everything from cryptocurrency payments to real-world assets to legal agreements.\n\nBlockchain technology is renowned for its security and immutability. The technology\u2019s name stems from the fact that it\u2019s comprised of a series of \u201cblocks,\u201d with each containing transaction data, a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Every transaction is linked in a \u201cchain\u201d and distributed across numerous nodes.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, there\u2019s little risk of manipulation from entities like governments or financial institutions. In fact, a blockchain\u2019s structure makes it nearly impossible to retroactively alter any single record without changing all subsequent blocks.\n\nBlockchain technology offers transparency and decentralization, making it an attractive option for transactional applications\u2014among them, money movement, supply chain management and even digital identity verification.\n\nEthereum and Solana\n\nWithin blockchain technology, there are many different blockchain platforms. Two of the most prominent blockchain platforms are Ethereum and Solana, each with unique features and capabilities.\n\nEthereum (ETH): Ethereum, launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum introduced the concept of \u201c smart contracts ,\u201d or self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The latest iteration of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus mechanism\u2014essentially, th e process by which validators create new blocks. ( Learn more about consensus mechanisms and how they work here .)\n\nSolana (SOL): Solana is a newer blockchain platform that launched to the public in 2020. It\u2019s known for speed and efficiency. It employs a unique hybrid consensus model, combining proof-of-history (PoH) with proof-of-stake (PoS). This enables it to process transactions rapidly and with lower fees compared to Ethereum. As such, Solana is an attractive platform for high-frequency trading and other applications requiring quick transaction times.\n\nEthereum and Solana have gained popularity because they offer solutions to common pain points related to scalability, speed and cost. These platforms have also sparked an entire ecosystem of subsequent innovation: Ethereum\u2019s smart contract functionality has given rise to decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThe future of finance: instant transfers and more\n\nImagine a world where international suppliers are paid the moment goods are shipped, employees receive compensation in real-time and complex financial transactions are settled instantly. This immediacy not only streamlines business operations, but also opens doors to new financial strategies like dynamic pricing. The ripple effects of such capabilities include more agile, responsive and competitive businesses and a transformation of the way global commerce operates.\n\nBlockchains like Ethereum and Solana have the potential to make such hypotheticals into realities. With their ability to power instant, 24/7 financial transactions across borders, blockchains may be particularly attractive to enterprises operating in multiple countries or those engaging in high-volume trade, not to mention the implications for sectors like e-commerce and digital supply chain management.\n\nBlockchain technology is evolving rapidly. Many enterprises need a hand when it comes to adopting it and maximizing its potential and a trusted partner can help you seamlessly integrate blockchain into existing operations.\n\nBlockchain is transforming the way we think about money, assets and transactions and is paving the way for new business models and strategies. With the right partners to help you navigate and implement blockchain systems, your business will be well-positioned to stay a step ahead in the digital finance era."

Despite the optimism, SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous statements suggest a cautious approach to approving crypto asset securities, particularly for assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nThe price increase reflects a broader market sentiment that an Ethereum ETF could soon follow the path of Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock and Ark having filed applications.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF has sparked discussions about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities, a debate that could impact the SEC\u2019s decision-making process."

        "title": "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,500? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are three different catalysts that have the potential to send Ethereum higher in 2024.\n\nAmid the current crypto market rally led by Bitcoin, there's one crypto that seems to be getting completely overlooked: Ethereum (ETH 0.21%). That's somewhat surprising, given that Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with an enormous $290 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, the hype around a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has focused investor attention squarely on Bitcoin. At the same time, a number of direct Ethereum rivals skyrocketed to triple-digit percentage gains last year, and have become the new darlings of crypto investors looking for maximum upside. But there are several reasons Ethereum might be undervalued at its current price of about $2,400.\n\nEthereum vs. the wannabe Ethereums\n\nAt the end of 2022, Ethereum was the talk of the crypto industry. It had just pulled off The Merge, which fundamentally transformed its blockchain to make it faster, cheaper, easier to use, and much more energy efficient. The hype around Ethereum grew to the point where some investors even thought that Ethereum might eventually surpass Bitcoin in terms of market cap.\n\nBut then came 2023. All of a sudden, rival blockchains like Solana started gaining traction with investors. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year. Avalanche, another Ethereum rival, was up nearly 200% for the year. By way of comparison, Ethereum was up 90%, and seemed to be losing the attention of investors.\n\nSo the big question is whether Ethereum is still best-in-class. If you think that the so-called Ethereum killers are just a bunch of Ethereum wannabes with no long-term staying power, then Ethereum could be highly undervalued at its current price. But if you think that Ethereum's long reign as the top Layer-1 blockchain network in the world is coming to an end, then it's a completely different story.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF incoming?\n\nRight now, the imminent arrival of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market is getting all the headlines. But, according to a growing number of crypto investors, a spot Ethereum ETF could be coming soon. And that means that Ethereum could soon get the same type of boost Bitcoin is getting right now.\n\nCertainly, the underlying logic makes sense. Wall Street is looking for more reliable ways to invest in crypto, and has apparently determined that the ETF investment product is the best way to achieve this. Once it can show that a spot Bitcoin ETF is successful, then it's time to crank up this formula for every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nGiven Ethereum's market heft -- it now accounts for about 17% of the market value of the entire crypto market, second only to Bitcoin -- it would only make sense that Ethereum would be next in line for a spot ETF. And, indeed, there is already an application in the works for just such a product. In September, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for a spot Ethereum ETF. If the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to approve this (admittedly, a big \"if\"), it could result in billions of dollars flowing into Ethereum, pushing up its price.\n\nA sexy new upgrade\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Ethereum's next big upgrade. Ethereum recently published its strategic roadmap for 2024, and one item on the roadmap that caught the attention of investors was something called EIP-4844 (\"Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844\"). Basically, this is a proposed technical change that would enable the processing of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to become much faster and more efficient.\n\nI know, I know. You're probably rolling your eyes right now. What a bunch of blockchain babble, right? But consider that EIP-4844 got J.P. Morgan really excited. In a research note to clients, JPMorgan specifically referred to EIP-4844 as a key reason it thinks Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024. That's because this major technical change would make it theoretically possible for the Ethereum blockchain to handle 100,000 transactions per second, up from about a dozen or so now. With that type of speed, Ethereum would basically be unstoppable.\n\nHow much higher can Ethereum go?\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum needs to convince investors that it is still the preeminent Layer-1 blockchain network. So keep an eye on how Ethereum deals with the growing threat from the likes of Solana. As long as investors buy into the idea that Solana is a faster and more cost-efficient version of Ethereum, it's hard to see Ethereum skyrocketing in price.\n\nWith that in mind, it's certainly possible to find a number of bullish Ethereum price predictions for 2024. Some crypto traders think that Ethereum could double, triple, or even quadruple in value. I may not be as bullish on Ethereum, but I'm certainly open to the idea that Ethereum could surprise a lot of people in 2024."

        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs backed by actual bitcoin finally hit US exchanges on Thursday after more than a decade of attempts. So far it\u2019s done mostly nothing for bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin briefly neared $49,000 after the spot ETFs went live but it has since shed about $3,000 to retrace by 6%.\n\nThat\u2019s even slightly below where it was before the SEC\u2019s social media hacker posted an authorized approval announcement about the ETFs on Tuesday, about 24 hours before legitimate confirmation.\n\nAny boon to the price of bitcoin seems to have come way earlier. Bitcoin traded around $25,000 before BlackRock filed for its spot ETF last June and rallied 20% within days.\n\nWith the post-BlackRock pump, bitcoin had reclaimed its pre-Terra implosion price.\n\nBitcoin would give up those gains in the weeks following. But by mid-October, a fake news tweet claiming the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s bid set bitcoin on a major uptrend.\n\nThere was immediate volatility around the tweet \u2014 climbing $2,000 and down again within 30 minutes \u2014 but bitcoin ended up shooting nearly two-thirds in two months, from $27,700 to $44,000 in December.\n\nAt this rate, ether could soon overtake bitcoin for six-month returns\n\nAbout there it hovered until earlier this week. Analysts, researchers, traders and pundits were generally in consensus that the SEC would indeed approve spot ETFs for launch in the US, and come Monday bitcoin had jumped 8% to clear $47,000 for the first time in almost two years.\n\nAll things considered, the bitcoin spot ETF approval was massively front-run by those trading on the rumor. Anyone who bought bitcoin when word of BlackRock\u2019s filing first broke last year would now be up by more than half.\n\nAnyone who bought bitcoin when the ETFs were officially approved would now be about even and could even be down slightly.\n\nHad they opted for ether, they\u2019d be up to 8% in the green, as traders appear looking to frontrun the next potential wave of crypto spot ETF approvals in the US.\n\nBlackRock and other issuers including Fidelity, VanEck and Invesco Galaxy have filed for a spot ether ETF since lodging their equivalent bitcoin applications. The SEC has between late May and early August to make its first decision.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin and ether diverge after SEC\u2019s bitcoin ETF snafu\n\nIn the meantime, markets seem to be waiting to find out exactly how much bitcoin BlackRock, Fidelity and other ETF issuers actually bought to back their respective funds after a busy day-one session, when more than $4.6 billion in spot ETF shares were traded in the US overall.\n\nIn and outflow figures would be the first indications of investor interest and could shed light on their potential influence on bitcoin prices moving forward.\n\nSome preliminary figures have been floated on social media but analysts warn they may not be totally accurate.

Balchunas previously stated that he could not see a scenario where spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved but spot Ether ETFs are not. He compared the two cryptocurrencies, saying that \"Ether spot is tied to the hip of Bitcoin spot.\"\n\nThe earliest deadline for spot Ethereum ETFs decision is in May later this year for VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF. BlackRock\u2019s deadline is in August, however if the SEC does approve, it could approve all applicants like it did for the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nPrior to the SEC's spot Bitcoin approval, Valkyrie Funds' chief investment officer Steven McClurg said he wouldn't be surprised if spot Ether and XRP ETFs come to market after Bitcoin. Several major asset managers, including BlackRock, VanEck, ARK Invest & 21Shares, Fidelity, and Invesco Galaxy, have filed applications for spot Ether ETFs.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin Are Surging Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals are just one catalyst taking these three tokens higher today.\n\nThe entire crypto world has been shaken, in a positive way, by recent developments around yesterday's approval of certain exchange-traded products. For Bitcoin Cash (BCH -2.72%), Ethereum Classic (ETC -1.60%), and Litecoin (LTC -1.18%), broadly positive sectorwide sentiment appears to be a key driver behind these tokens' impressive moves higher. As of 2 p.m. ET, these three tokens have rocketed 13.9%, 34.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe approvals of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has undoubtedly led to significant interest across the cryptocurrency sector today. Much of today's increase can be attributed to expectations that institutional capital will flow into this sector in dramatic fashion. In fact, projections from some analysts peg the impact of these approvals at around $100 billion. That's a win not only for Bitcoin, but for investors considering this entire space, as it legitimizes crypto for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nLet's dive into what's behind the specific moves in these three cryptos today, over and above the obviously bullish headline news dominating the market right now.\n\nWhy are these three tokens surging today?\n\nFor Bitcoin Cash, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system tied closely to Bitcoin, today's news is obviously a net positive for this network. However, there are other key drivers supporting Bitcoin Cash's recent performance. News that cryptocurrency payments have surged to a record high in 2024 is very bullish for the likes of Bitcoin cash and other payments-focused cryptocurrencies. A report on Jan. 10 cited that nearly 1.3 million Bitcoin transactions were reportedly processed in 2023 alone, bringing the total number of Bitcoin transactions to more than 4 million. For those bullish on crypto as a payments facilitation technology, this is a strong catalyst to consider for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nFor Ethereum classic, the proof-of-work fork of the Ethereum blockchain, excitement around the potential approval for spot Ethereum ETF approvals appears to be driving interest in this adjacent token. Essentially, investors and traders appear to be speculating on a potential hard fork for Ethereum Classic, which would better align the network with Ethereum's, and improve its outlook (if Ethereum surges as a result of ETF approvals, one could argue Ethereum Classic could be due for a rally as well). Of course, such a substantial move of more than 30% may be overdone, so this will certainly be a token traders focus in on in the coming days.\n\nLitecoin's more muted rise today appears to be tied more to sector-specific tailwinds than anything else. Largely viewed as a Bitcoin and Ethereum alternative, this is a token that typically rides the tides higher and lower over specific time frames. Right now, there's a rising tide lifting most boats in this sector, and Litecoin investors are certainly pleased to see momentum taking this token higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nIs this momentum sustainable?\n\nUltimately, we'll have to see if these spot ETF approvals are a \"sell the news\" event, or a strong catalyst that puts a floor beneath crypto prices for the foreseeable future. In many respects, we won't know which outcome will materialize until after the fact. Thus, some amount of hesitation may lead to a waiting period for certain long-term investors, and could present an opportunity for buyers considering these tokens to jump in and ride momentum higher over the medium term.\n\nOverall, I think yesterday's spot ETF approvals are a bullish catalyst for the sector. For one, these approvals legitimize crypto as an asset class institutional investors can buy into. Another key factor driving sectorwide interest is the flurry of institutional capital expected for large-cap cryptos. Accordingly, for those seeking exposure to these trends, and looking for less-visible (and potentially higher-upside) ways to play crypto, these three tokens will likely continue to be in focus in the coming weeks."

        "title": "Top 9 Blockchain Platforms to Consider in 2024 - TechTarget",
        "content": "Interest in blockchain platforms has been growing significantly as a way to streamline supply chains, improve traceability, simplify trade and improve financial transactions. A lot of this interest started with the speculative frenzy surrounding Bitcoin, which is based on an older blockchain platform that faces challenges with energy consumption and speed.\n\nModern blockchain platforms have been developed to help overcome these limitations and provide practical value for other business uses and applications. \"We are seeing multiple enterprises adopt blockchain platforms for some of their application needs,\" said Suseel Menon, practice director at Everest Group, an IT advisory firm.\n\nMenon has seen the most interest in areas that require multiparty cooperation or data exchange. Blockchain applications in supply chain tracking, trade finance, digital assets and identity management are going beyond the pilot stage. Menon has also seen a fair bit of activity in using blockchain platforms for building certain functions of ERP, such as vendor management and supply chain management (SCM).\n\nAlex-Paul Manders, a partner at Information Services Group, an IT advisory firm, said the evolution of blockchain platforms to date has promoted heightened awareness of decentralized finance, or DeFi, for driving new business models that pose significant threats to traditional banking, finance and supply chain finance.\n\nAlex-Paul Manders Alex-Paul Manders\n\nManders predicted that blockchain platforms could disrupt legacy supply chain businesses and technology processes. For example, U.S. requirements for pharmaceutical companies to track and trace products and materials call for a new approach for supply chain participants to share and transact data more efficiently and with more transparency than previously required. Blockchain technology could be the answer.\n\nAccording to Menon, the top three blockchain frameworks for these use cases are R3 Corda, Hyperledger and Ethereum, with EOSIO and ConsenSys Quorum gaining ground.\n\nHere are nine of the top blockchain platforms to consider.\n\n1. Ethereum Introduced in 2013, Ethereum is one of the oldest and most established blockchain platforms. It provides a truly decentralized blockchain that is comparable to the Bitcoin blockchain network. Manders said its key strength is that it enables true decentralization with support for smart contracts. Its key weaknesses include slow processing times and higher transaction processing costs compared to other platforms. Besides its role as a blockchain platform that underpins enterprise applications, it has its own cryptocurrency called Ether. Suseel Menon Suseel Menon The Ethereum platform has seen widespread adoption by technologists who build decentralized applications, or dApps, on the Ethereum network. For example, there are numerous platforms and exchanges for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) -- a type of digital asset that can be exchanged on a blockchain. It has a mature ecosystem of tools for writing smart contracts using the Solidity programming environment, which runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. However, alternative blockchain networks can process transactions much faster at potentially lower cost than Ethereum, though many observers expect this to change after Ethereum adopts a more efficient security mechanism. It also has an active developer community orchestrated by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which has more than 250 members, including Intel, JPMorgan and Microsoft. The Ethereum community migrated from a proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof of stake (PoS), which is more energy-friendly. The migration required an elaborate process to spin up a separate, new type of blockchain called a Beacon Chain that has been merged into the existing main Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation estimated this reduces energy use by 99.95% compared to the older approach. The community was previously considering sharding, which involved splitting up the Ethereum blockchain to expand the capacity to store data, scale throughput and cut network fees. However, new techniques for combining transactions to be processed together, called layer 2 rollups, evolved faster than expected, and sharding was dropped from the roadmap. Now the community is focusing on a simpler approach, called Proto-Danksharding, which streamlines layer 2 rollups. The goal is to eventually support up to 100,000 transactions per second using this new approach. There are many things to consider when choosing a blockchain platform, including performance and cost.\n\n2. IBM Blockchain IBM Blockchain is a private, decentralized blockchain network that has been the most successful with enterprise clients who are less risk-averse, Manders said. He has seen the biggest opportunities in using it to link into enterprise cloud and legacy technologies more seamlessly than is possible in other decentralized networks. The IBM Blockchain developer tool was designed to be flexible, functional and customizable. IBM has also invested in creating a user-friendly interface to simplify critical tasks, such as setting up, testing and rapidly deploying smart contracts. Rakesh Mohan, IBM director of development, blockchain, said the company has seen significant progress in financial services and banking, as well as supply chain. Rakesh Mohan Rakesh Mohan Some examples of successful blockchain apps include IBM Food Trust, which has completed more than 18 million transactions representing more than 17,000 products, and Blockchain Community Initiative in Thailand, which supports services such as payment obligations and enterprise auctions for 22 Thai banks. IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply is designed to help enterprises improve traceability in supply chain management. Top features support quality assurance for validating the provenance of materials, improved forecasting and tools to reduce the cost of dispute resolution, product recalls and document sharing. Various tools help manufacturing, retail, pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies jump-start their blockchain rollout.\n\n3. Hyperledger Fabric Hyperledger Fabric is a set of tools for creating blockchain applications. Championed by the Linux Foundation, it was built from the ground up with enterprise distributed ledger uses in mind. It has a rich ecosystem of components that can be plugged into a modular architecture. It works well in closed blockchain deployments, which can improve security and speed. It also supports an open smart contract model that can support various data models, such as account and unspent transaction output (UTXO) models. Hyperledger Fabric can also improve data privacy by isolating transactions in channels or enabling the sharing of private data on a need-to-know basis in private data collections. It also enables high-speed transactions with low latency of finality and confirmation, according to its proponents. It is supported by leading cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, IBM, Google, Microsoft Azure and Oracle. Arnaud Le Hors, senior technical staff member of open technologies at IBM, said the latest developments add support for an organization to join a channel without copying the whole history of the ledger. This enables a quicker startup process with less storage required. There is an active and diverse community around Hyperledger Fabric that is working on adding more features related to consensus algorithms, additional privacy options for GDPR compliance and operational improvements. Key features to consider Blockchain platforms consist of a wide range of components, which enables enterprises to select the appropriate components for different kinds of capabilities, said Chris Georgen, founder and managing director at Topl, which built a blockchain for sustainability. Chris Georgen Chris Georgen Georgen recommended examining four features when evaluating platforms: Whether a platform is open (public) or closed (private) and how that affects speed and security. Anyone can join a public blockchain, which can make it easier to set up for small businesses. The downside is open blockchains aren't as fast. Many blockchain codebases can be modified to be either open or closed. Consensus mechanism, such as PoW, PoS or Byzantine fault tolerance. PoW is the older mechanism used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The others are newer and less proven but faster and more efficient, Georgen said. Ledger technology and how it records transactions. Popular approaches include an account model and UTXO. An account model records the balance, whereas UTXO is analogous to cash with serial numbers. The account model is used in Ethereum, Stellar, Tron and EOSIO. IBM Blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth use UTXO. Smart contract functions for capturing business logic on the blockchain. Popular programming languages include Ethereum Solidity, WebAssembly languages and Digital Asset Modeling Language.\n\n4. Hyperledger Sawtooth Another open source blockchain initiative hosted by Hyperledger and the Linux Foundation is Hyperledger Sawtooth. One of its key advantages is that it allows enterprises to choose from several consensus mechanisms for different use cases. One novel consensus mechanism called proof of elapsed time can integrate with hardware-based security technologies to enable \"trusted execution environments\" of program code to run in secure enclaves, which are protected areas of computer memory. It also supports practical Byzantine fault tolerance which can allow nodes to reach consensus if hackers or other bad actors compromise some nodes. Sawtooth Raft uses a leader-based consensus algorithm that provides crash tolerance for a private and controlled group of users. Shawn Amundson Shawn Amundson Shawn Amundson, principal consultant at Bitwise IO, said the most common applications are for developing supply chain systems and customizing Sawtooth for specific purposes, such as novel consensus algorithms. A Sawtooth library enables developers of custom distributed ledgers to pick and choose which pieces of Sawtooth they use in their application. Sawtooth also supports Splinter for networking, which provides dynamic private circuits (groups of nodes); Hyperledger Transact for transaction processing to enhance smart contract capabilities; and Augrim for consensus, which expands the number of supported algorithms.\n\n5. R3 Corda There is some debate whether R3 Corda is technically a blockchain or an alternative type of distributed ledger. It uses a novel consensus mechanism in which transactions are cryptographically linked but does not periodically batch multiple transactions into a block. Even the official Corda site describes it as \"both a blockchain and not a blockchain.\" One of the key benefits of this approach is that all transactions are processed in real time, which can improve performance compared to other types of blockchains. The R3 consortium has a strong following in the financial industry, since Corda provides an attractive approach for financial transactions and smart contracts with strong security. Leading proponents include Bank of America, HSBC, Intel and Microsoft. It supports tools that automate business logic that can execute across company boundaries. In 2022, the group launched a technical preview of Corda Payments, which it claimed will simplify the process for building distributed payment capabilities into apps. A recent platform update purportedly improves availability and scalability and supports interoperability with other platforms. One key innovation is a delivery-versus-payment mechanism designed to improve settlement with other distributed ledger platforms. Manders said Corda has a strong chance of becoming the de facto network of insurance-related transaction processing. However, it faces competition from other federated blockchain networks that can process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\n6. Tezos In development since 2014, Tezos is an older platform that supports decentralized applications, smart contracts and novel financial instruments, such as NFTs, which can be thought of as a modern variation on trading cards that are tied to digital assets. The platform supports a dynamically upgradable protocol and modular software clients that enable it to adapt to new uses. It supports a PoS consensus mechanism that improves efficiency compared to Bitcoin and the original Ethereum implementation. An on-chain upgrade mechanism allows developers to add new features without forking, which would require spinning up a new blockchain and migrating users over. The Tezos community has been upgrading the platform at a rapid clip with enhancements that improved performance and increased the size limit on smart contracts. It has also developed tools to help automate the process of weaving NFTs into enterprise supply chains. The latest update proposal, called the Oxford 2 protocol, promises several new enhancements. An improved PoS mechanism creates new roles for nodes. The update also reintroduces a new version of timelocks (which was previously removed), to improve security and smart rollups to speed up the transaction rate.\n\n7. EOSIO The EOSIO blockchain platform was first launched as an open source project in 2018. It's optimized for developing decentralized applications and smart contracts. It uses a complex consensus mechanism based on PoS that provides better performance than older mechanisms, such as Ethereum, according to its proponents. It also includes support for a governance feature for voting on changes to the platform. Key strengths include fast transactions and advanced account permission features for deploying applications. Over 400 applications have been developed on the platform, including identity management, SCM and gaming. The community also provides tools for customizing blockchain implementations for various decentralized use cases in SCM, healthcare and DeFi. EOSIO-Taurus, a new blockchain released in June, was forked from the EOSIO codebase and is designed for enterprise performance on private blockchains. It includes features to handle a larger volume of transactions more securely and to improve resilience, automatic failover and disaster recovery. In addition, it could make it easier to connect the blockchain to external systems. New debugging tools are meant to improve smart contract development.\n\n8. Stellar Stellar is a newer blockchain platform optimized for various kinds of DeFi applications. It uses Stellar Consensus Protocol, which purportedly can speed up the time required to process and finalize transactions on a public blockchain network. It also includes security mechanisms for shutting out bad or questionable actors in a financial transaction. It has been adopted by several companies for international trade and exchanging money across borders. Examples of applications built on the Stellar blockchain include MoneyGram for money transfer, Circle for payments and treasury infrastructure, and Flutterwave for integrating payment processing into enterprise applications. The Soroban smart contract platform helps streamline development of Web 3.0 and DeFi applications on Stellar."

        "content": "Traders continue to sell the news of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin (BTC -0.15%) ETF was supposed to bring billions of dollars into the crypto industry, but in typical fashion, investors bought the rumor and sold the news. As of 2:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, and the selling accelerated early this morning.\n\nEthereum (ETH 0.21%) has rallied the last few days but dropped 3.7% between 10 a.m. ET and 2:30 p.m. ET. Dogecoin (DOGE -0.56%) plunged 3.9% in just the last few hours as well.\n\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF approval was months in the making, and when these ETFs were announced on Wednesday, Jan. 10, the market started to sell off. A lot of traders had bought in anticipation of the ETFs (buying the rumor) and then began selling when there was no longer a catalyst to count on in the future (sell the news).\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin has been flat in the past week, Ethereum is up 10%, and Dogecoin is down just 0.4%. So there hasn't been a big move if you pull back a bit.\n\nI do think it's notable that Ethereum has gained as much as it has. The speculation trade has likely moved to the second-largest cryptocurrency, which could eventually be a popular ETF asset as well.\n\nTechnology takes it on the chin\n\nCryptocurrency doesn't trade in a vacuum, either. Over the last three years, cryptocurrency has traded with high-growth tech stocks, and they're having a terrible day.\n\nLayoffs at Cloudflare, Alphabet, Discord, and dozens of other companies are calling into question the growth we should expect for 2024. There's still a delayed realization in parts of the tech industry that growth is slowing and costs need to come under control if companies are going to be profitable.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily impact cryptocurrencies directly, but if cryptocurrencies trade with growth tech stocks, it's not surprising to see a sell-off.\n\nWhat we don't know matters most\n\nThe theory of the last few months in cryptocurrencies was that an ETF approval would bring new buyers into the crypto market, bringing billions of dollars with them. But will that be the case?\n\nIt seems to me that buying cryptocurrencies is easy enough for anyone who wanted to buy some over the last few years. An ETF may make it easier in some ways, but it also comes with fees that are unnecessary for cryptocurrencies you can hold in self-custody.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies continue to fall as the market realizes that new money isn't coming in as expected following ETF approvals. And there's no increased utilization of the blockchain for innovative purposes if assets are held in an ETF.\n\nThis week has been more volatile than even a normal week in crypto. Don't be surprised if that's the theme for the next few weeks as the market figures out who is buying crypto to hold and who was just speculating on ETF approvals. There may be more speculation going on than investors would like to think."

        "title": "Parallelized EVMs are gaining popularity, but they won\u2019t scale blockchains alone - Blockworks",
        "content": "Improving technology for scaling blockchains requires tackling multifaceted problems. New attempts to parallelize the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) have gained interest in recent weeks, as developers look for possibilities to increase transaction throughput.\n\nThe EVM is the execution environment that runs on Ethereum and its layer-2 rollups, and also has been adopted by other layer-1 networks such Avalanche, Binance Chain and many others, which use it to process smart contract code.\n\nIn typical EVM implementations, transactions are processed one after the other in the order they arrive. This simple approach can lead to longer processing times and higher costs when there are many transactions, explains Marina Guryeva, the CEO of Neon Labs, which is implementing the EVM as a smart contract on Solana.\n\n\u201cFor Ethereum, the traditional sequential execution model simplifies hardware requirements, but on the downside, it creates limitations in handling the increasing volume of transactions,\u201d Guryeva told Blockworks. \u201cThis worsens during peak usage times resulting in longer transaction wait times, higher gas fees vis-a-vis demand surge, and an overall fractured user experience.\u201d\n\nGuryeva said that much of the growing interest in parallel EVMs is due to its ability to tackle these challenges around blockchain scalability, addressing issues related to the blockchain trilemma.\n\n\u201cThe parallel processing approach addresses the longstanding challenges of scalability and transaction processing efficiency within the Ethereum network,\u201d Guryeva said.\n\nMany transactions can be processed at the same time, instead of sequentially, so long as they don\u2019t depend on each other.\n\nThere are other ways to achieve parallel processing, such as at the database-level with approaches such as sharding, that essentially divide Ethereum\u2019s state into smaller \u201cshards\u201d but full sharding remains years away.\n\nRead more: Dencun and Pralectra: Ethereum core devs chart an ambitious 2024\n\nParallelized EVMs, however, including the likes of Sei network, Monad and Neon, are already production ready or nearly so. The Sei network launched its mainnet in August 2023 and has seen recent monthly trading volume of about $136 million with a little over 29 thousand active DEX users, according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto.\n\nIts native token, SEI, has surged from around $0.23 at the beginning of December to around $0.68 today \u2014 an almost 200% jump. Neon too, has seen a significant increase in its token price, with NEON trading from $0.50 on Dec. 1 to roughly $2.55 today.\n\nMonad has yet to launch and does not yet have its own token.\n\nA look into popular parallel EVM protocols\n\nMuch of the work being done on the Neon EVM is to bring the Ethereum dapps into the Solana ecosystem, Guryeva said.\n\n\u201cIt is a fully compatible Ethereum environment on Solana and allows developers to scale Ethereum dapps using Solana as the settlement layer,\u201d she said.\n\nGuryeva notes that Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain that supports smart contracts and dapps, but Solana\u2019s Sealevel technology \u2014 which enables virtual machines to process multiple transactions simultaneously through distributing transaction workload across multiple threads on a validator\u2019s hardware \u2014 enables lower gas fees and higher scalability.\n\nJay Jog the co-founder of Sei Labs shares this sentiment, he notes that Ethereum rollups struggle to get over 30 sustained transactions per second, which limits the design space on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cA parallelized EVM lets you get the best of Ethereum and Solana \u2014 the EVM and all of the mindshare/tooling around it and the fast execution environment that Solana offers,\u201d he said.\n\nSei\u2019s latest version has its EVM built into the chain, Jog added.\n\n\u201cSei uses Geth \u2014 the Go implementation of the EVM \u2014 to get full EVM bytecode compatibility. Geth is very battle tested and currently processes ~85% of [Ethereum] blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is different from its competitor Monad, which is creating a custom EVM implementation, Jog notes.\n\nDespite these differences, both Monad and Sei are using optimistic parallel execution to achieve parallel processing.\n\nWith this technique, virtual machines run in parallel on separate threads within the network computer. Each thread would execute transactions and generate what Keone Hon, the co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, calls \u201cpending results.\u201d\n\nThese pending results track the inputs and outputs of the transactions which are then committed back into their original linear order. If any pending result has inputs that have been invalidated, then a transaction must be rescheduled.\n\n\u201cThis means that Monad still supports linear blocks and linear transactions within the blocks,\u201d Hon told Blockworks. \u201cMonad can basically take transaction formats that are exactly the same as Ethereum and then, under the hood, implement parallelism without any changes from the user perspective.\u201d\n\nOptimistic parallel execution is different from what Solana uses, for example, where dapps have to pre-specify dependencies of the transactions, Hon said, analogous to the access list approach on Ethereum.\n\nParallelized EVMs are a stepping stone\n\nIt is important to note, Hon adds, that parallel execution is a small fraction of the bigger picture, with Monad\u2019s more general mission being centered around accelerating EVM execution to make it as performant as possible.\n\n\u201cThe real bottleneck is actually the state access that all of those transactions are being run, they all have dependencies on state, and that state lives on SSD (solid-state drive),\u201d Hon said.\n\nThe majority of smart contract work has relatively simple computation, he said, and bigger constraints for smart contracts are often the input/output component \u2014 the process of reading from the SSD and then writing back data.\n\nParallelism only cuts a small fraction of costs, according to Rachel Bousfield, the tech lead at Offchain Labs, because parallel execution is rarely possible in practice across current Web3 dapps.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nEthereum-like blockchains generally use commodity databases for reading and writing data. These have the advantage of being widely accessible, purchased \u201coff the shelf,\u201d but they are not optimized for the problem of storing the Merkle tree data, necessary for parallel processing on the blockchain, Hon notes.\n\nThis means that, fundamentally, in order to decrease transaction processing times and gas prices, infrastructure around the database will have to change.\n\n\u201cSo one of the other really major things that Monad is building is a custom state database from scratch that supports parallel access so that when there are many threads running in parallel, touching the database \u2014 to get inputs, or write outbacks back to it \u2014 those can proceed in parallel,\u201d Hon said.\n\nMonad is not alone in focusing on alleviating state dependencies. Sei too, is working to make improvements in this area, Jog notes.\n\n\u201cWe are doing a lot of work on the state layer to improve state access, state commit, and state storage,\u201d he said.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Fake Airdrop for Ethereum, Solana, Tron Users Carried out by Scammers\n\nHackers target the Ethereum, Solana, and Tron crypto communities by enticing them with a fake airdrop scheme.\n\nWallet drainers, previously fixated on executing crypto scams via EVM chains, have now expanded their horizons to target Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Tron (TRX) communities.\n\nThis shift marks a concerning trend as these scammers venture into well-established crypto groups.\n\nPhishing Scams via Fake Airdrops\n\nThe modus operandi involves enticing crypto enthusiasts through fraudulent airdrops. The scammers create a webpage where users can supposedly claim Ethereum, Solana, and Tron airdrop rewards.\n\nThese scams are labeled an \"exclusive opportunity\" for the community, urging individuals to link their primary wallets for access. Scam Sniffer highlights that these fraudsters can drain various crypto wallets using this deceptive webpage.\n\nAccording to CoinGape, this development is particularly problematic given the popularity of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, alongside Solana and Tron.\n\nThe lure of substantial crypto rewards might mislead investors, potentially resulting in significant losses amounting to millions or even billions in digital assets due to these wallet drainer scams.\n\nIdentifying and Avoiding Crypto Scams\n\nWhile scammers occasionally upgrade their strategies, identifying potential scams can still be achieved through simple checks.\n\nAccording to Blockworks, Scam Sniffer's shared snapshot reveals grammatical errors on the fraudulent airdrop webpage, serving as a red flag for cautious users. However, it's crucial to remain vigilant as scammers adapt and refine their tactics over time.\n\nTo stay secure, always verify the source of such links. If a reputable entity is not the source of the airdrop updates, it is advisable to steer clear of such offerings.\n\nFurthermore, heightened caution is necessary, considering recent incidents where hackers compromised verified X accounts of well-known companies like Certik and Mandiant to promote crypto scams.\n\nEarlier this month, Certik experienced a similar attack on its X account, followed by Mandiant on January 4, 2024, raising concerns about the security of even the most established platforms.\n\nPhoto: Nahel Abdul Hadi / Unsplash\n\nTokenPost | [email protected]"

Let us learn more about what is happening in the industry and why ETC is going up, in the present article.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Spot ETF Approved, Finally\n\nThe long-awaited Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved by the US SEC on 10 January, 2024. Entire crypto industry has been waiting for this news for several months. And, now that it is finally approved, several altcoins and Bitcoin are following an uptrend.\n\nThe anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF approval has itself brought considerable returns for Bitcoin since the past couple of months. From around $26,600 in October, 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s value breached the $45,000 mark as soon as we entered January, 2024.\n\nWhile one of the strong reasons behind this price rally was the awaiting Bitcoin spot ETF approval, another reason is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event.\n\nAs the US SEC final judgment approached, a fake post was posted from the official X account. This caused a sharp price spike in the BTC chart. However, Gary Gensler, chair of the US SEC clarified that the US SEC account was hacked and the ETF approval post was posted by unauthorized individuals. As Gary Gensler stated that the post was fake, the BTC price dropped around 5% within a couple of hours.\n\nHowever, the US SEC finally approved the Bitcoin spot ETF application of Grayscale Investments. As a result, several altcoins like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Pepe Coin, and others are rising in value.\n\nEthereum Hits 20-Month High\n\nEthereum Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nSurprisingly, the Bitcoin spot ETF approval has more impact on altcoins when compared to Bitcoin. The BTC price rose slightly and briefly touched the $47,000 mark whereas the Ether price increased by around 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading above $2,600, at the time of writing.\n\nEthereum has hit its 20-month high as the last time it traded above $2,600 was in May, 2022. At present, Ethereum price is recording 18% weekly gains and 16% monthly gains. And, the ETH price is expected to rise further.\n\nMost of the investors believe that Ethereum is the next best cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Because of its sophisticated technology and network upgrades Ethereum stands out from the rest of the cryptocurrencies. And, investors don\u2019t hesitate when it comes to Ethereum in the market conditions like present.\n\nEthereum Classic to Reach the $30 Mark\n\nEthereum Classic Price Chart on Jan 11, 2024\n\nThe clear winner among all the altcoins is Ethereum Classic. The ETC price rose by 34% in the last 24 hours and is showing no signs of slowing down with its increasing trading volume. It is currently trading at around $28 and is just $2 away from reaching the $30 mark.\n\nSo far, Ethereum Classic is one of the top performing altcoins in the crypto industry after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval surfaced. In addition to the price, its trading volume is soaring by 276%, standing at $1.8 billion and implying that the price could surge further. Its market capitalization also surged by 34% and crossed the $4 billion mark today.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event are not only pushing the BTC price but also the prices of altcoins."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe red-hot Ordinal Inscription protocol continues to draw new developers who hope to put their stamp on the Bitcoin blockchain. The latest is Bitfinity, which aims to integrate its Ethereum Virtual Machine with Bitcoin. The grand plan, Bitfinity said on Thursday, is to support Bitcoin-enabled DeFi services using a sidechain on the Internet Computer.\n\nTo achieve this, Bitfinity has raised $7 million in new funding, led by San Francisco-based investment firm Polychain Capital and Connecticut-based ParaFi Capital.\n\n\u201cAs the demand to integrate Bitcoin increases, we believe Bitfinity\u2019s EVM opens up the Bitcoin ecosystem to novel use cases and applications,\u201d ParaFi Capital managing partner Ben Forman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to support the entire Bitfinity team on their mission to enhance Bitcoin utility.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2021 by the Dfinity Foundation, Internet Computer (ICP) is an advanced blockchain-based computing system housed in a network of machines distributed worldwide. Internet Computer uses a unique consensus model called proof-of-useful-work, which aims to be more efficient than proof-of-work yet more secure than proof-of-stake models.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitfinity says smart contracts can hold and transfer Bitcoin and Ordinal assets on-chain using the Internet Computer's threshold signature scheme, known as Chain-Key.\n\nBitfinity\u2019s EVM scheme is not the first time the ICP network has been used to handle Ordinal inscriptions. In November, Ordinals Marketplace Bioniq launched on the Internet Computer.\n\nBitfinity founder Max Chamberlin said the project is not meant to supplant Bitcoin but to show that Ethereum and Bitcoin devotees are not that different.\n\n\u201cJustin Drake, an Ethereum researcher, once quipped, \u2018Ethereum is Bitcoin,\u2019 Bitfinity founder Max Chamberlin told Decrypt. \u201cIn the spirit of those words, I believe we are all Bitcoiners. Bitfinity is for everyone, and though some Bitcoin purists might shudder at the thought, they weren\u2019t supportive of Ordinals or BRC-20 tokens anyway, and those took off to dizzying heights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Bitfinity may offer lower cost and faster speeds, the company will still have to convince Bitcoin purists and Ordinal enthusiasts to use their platform instead of minting on the blockchain directly.\n\n\u201cBitfinity doesn't change the fact that Ordinals are directly inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain, and as such, doesn\u2019t change the core ethos of on-chain digital assets,\" Chamberlin said. \u201cRather, it just makes it cheaper to use them.\u201d\n\nSince its launch last year, over 50 million Ordinal inscriptions have been minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. One of the most recent inscriptions was of a letter from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler announcing the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn addition to Ordinals, Bitfinity said future Bitcoin plans include BRC-20 tokens in its protocol. The BRC-20 standard allows users to create meme-coins on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cIf the lessons learned from Ethereum are anything to go by, many users will prefer a low-cost side-chain or L2 to run their transactions,\u201d Chamberlin concluded. \u201cSo perhaps we could rejoin, in the spirit of Justin Drake, and declare\u2014far from Ethereum being Bitcoin\u2014Bitcoin is actually Ethereum through L2s like Bitfinity and much more beyond that.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to correct the type of consensus algorithm used by Internet Computer."

As with Bitcoin, futures ETF products based on Ethereum have already been approved and launched, while applications for spot ETF investments are awaiting a decision by the SEC.\n\n\u201cETH\u2019s recent outperformance relative to BTC is a nod to the market\u2019s anticipation of a spot ETF approval,\u201d Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian digital asset management firm 3iQ, told Unchained in an email.\n\nRead more: Why Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are (But Mostly Aren\u2019t) a Big Deal for Crypto\n\nBitcoin was roughly flat over the last 24 hours after gaining as much as 6%, but optimism about a spot Bitcoin ETF has been driving prices up higher for some time now, with Bitcoin rising more than 80% since BlackRock and Fidelity first stoked enthusiasm last June by filing their ETF applications. Overall, Bitcoin has gained about 174% over the last year, compared to Ethereum\u2019s gain of about 99%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAccording to analysts, this disparity is largely due to the fact that the narrative driving Bitcoin\u2019s rally \u2014 optimism around the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals\u2014 directly relates to Bitcoin rather than crypto as a whole. But now that attention is shifting to ETH ETF approvals, will ETH experience the same type of huge rally?\n\n\u201cI would say that it\u2019s not going to be the exact same because Bitcoin\u2019s qualities are more fundamentally oriented towards gold where it is secure, it is a stored value. It is a money,\u201d said Connors., He later noted that Ethereum is more of a decentralized, dynamic platform than Bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAfter approving a slate of Ethereum futures-based ETFs late last year, the SEC now has until May to decide on spot ETFs, including offerings from VanEck, ARK Invest 21Shares, and BlackRock.\n\n\u201cInvestors are waiting for the spot ETFs for Ethereum exposure,\u201d said Neena Mishra, ETF research director at Zacks Investment Research, during a call with Unchained. \u201cEthereum futures ETFs made their debut late last year, and we\u2019ve seen almost no interest from investors. That was not a surprise because investors want the real thing.\u201d\n\nRead more: Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Sparks Altcoin Rally\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that Bitcoin is the only digital asset that isn\u2019t a security, which could make it harder for Ethereum to get approved. But Mishra doesn\u2019t think that stance will stand in the way of spot ether ETF approvals since the futures-based ETFs positioned Ethereum as a commodity. Gensler was also hesitant about the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as evidenced when he posted an X thread warning about the risks of crypto investments earlier this week, but the approvals still happened.\n\n\u201cI see very low chances of [the SEC] not approving the spot Ethereum ETFs,\u201d Mishra noted."

The capital rotation from BTC to altcoins has favored some projects more than others, with ETC presenting among the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nAlso Read: Spot BTC ETFs trading volumes approach $5 billion in day one of trading after SEC approvals\n\nEthereum Classic price eyes 15% crash after massive rally\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) price skyrocketed almost 75% since January 8, clearing multi-month blockades to reclaim levels last tested in September 2022. In the aftermath of ETC being massively overbought, a correction may be underway that could see token holders lose 15% of the ground covered.\n\nThe position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 76 confirms the overbought outlook, precipitating a correction. Also, the price has broken past the upper band of the Bollinger indicator in a move that often precedes a pullback as the price has climbed too much.\n\nThis is based on the concept of mean reversion of the price, which assumes that the price deviating substantially from the mean or average, causes it to eventually revert back to the mean price.\n\nAccordingly, the Ethereum Classic price could pull south, falling below the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $28.10. An extended fall could see the altcoin descend below the upper band of the Bollinger indicator at $26.33 to test the most important Fibonacci level, 61.8% at $24.78.\n\nIn the dire case, the Ethereum Classic price could fall below the 50% Fibonacci level, not only invalidating the prevailing bullish outlook but also testing the centerline of the Bollinger indicator at $21.91. This level failing to hold as support would send the altcoin to the depths of the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $20.11, or worse, the 23.6% retracement at $17.22.\n\nETC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, considering the Awesome Oscillator (AO) has restored above the midline, turning positive with green histogram bars, the bulls are also at play, which could bode well for Ethereum Classic price.\n\nIncreased participation among the bulls could see Ethereum Classic price extend north, filling the market range and recording a higher high above $32.29. A decisive candlestick close above this level would invalidate the bearish thesis."

        "title": "Crypto CEO Claims 'Ethereum Is The Next FTX' - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In a controversial statement, Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, known for pioneering nation-state Bitcoin adoption, sparked intense debate in the cryptocurrency community with his assertion on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cEthereum is the next FTX.\u201d This comparison to the infamous crypto exchange which collapsed in November 2022 has raised eyebrows and concerns, particularly as Mow linked his claim to a tweet by on-chain sleuth \u201cTruthLabs\u201d (@BoringSleuth).\n\nEthereum is the next FTX. https://t.co/qCqga1Q5XW \u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 12, 2024\n\nUnpacking The Allegations: The Blockchain Bandit Connection\n\nTruthLabs\u2019 tweet highlights a disturbing connection between a founding ETH developer and the enigmatic \u201cBlockchain Bandit,\u201d known for massive crypto thefts. The researcher\u2019s tweet read:\n\nRemember, one of the Founding Devs of Ethereum sent Ethereum/Gas to the Blockchain Bandit during the period in time in which The Blockchain Bandit was draining thousands of normal people\u2019s wallets holding their Crypto (2015/2016) on the Ethereum Blockchain. It wasn\u2019t until 1 year later that this exploit was revealed.\n\nThis revelation suggests a potential inside link between Ethereum\u2019s early development team and the notorious hacker. The researcher further notes that this took place just three months prior to The DAO exploit, which, according to hin, \u201cwas a complete, provable, inside job.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat if I told you the Movie made on the Blockchain Bandit, the Book by Laura Shin made about the Dao exploit, were both massive coverups so that nobody would look deeper? 2024 will be the year of Crypto\u2019s Grand Awakening.\u201d\n\nFurther intensifying the scrutiny, TruthLabs\u2019 October 2023 claim implicated Christoph Jentzsch, a core ETH developer and the mind behind The DAO. TruthLabs stated, \u201cNot only did Christoph Jentzsch launch THE DAO, but ANOTHER one of Ethereum\u2019s core DEV\u2019s, who had keys to the Ethereum Foundations Wallets, interacted with THE BLOCKCHAIN BANDIT\u2019s wallet, PRIOR to the DAO Hack.\u201d\n\nSteven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor and self-proclaimed \u201cETH whistleblower,\u201d has expressed outrage over the lack of media coverage on these allegations. His statement on X asserted: \u201cNO PRESS ON DAO HACK?! Not a single article on the biggest bombshell in crypto history. If not true they could disprove it with on-chain data.\u201d\n\nNerayoff insists that the DAO Hack bears \u201cthe hallmarks & evidence of being an inside job,\u201d and he believes that the transaction reversal, potential market manipulation, and insider trading point to a broader conspiracy, potentially even a RICO violation. \u201cOn chain analysis coupled with other evidence points to people within the ETH Foundation & http://Slock.It responsible,\u201c Nerayoff asserted.\n\nNerayoff is currently preparing a lawsuit against the ETH founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin for their alleged fraudulent activities. In recent weeks, however, things have become quieter around Nerayoff, who has not yet revealed a date when the lawsuit will be filed.\n\nThe Blockchain Bandit And Ethereum DAO Hack\n\nThe \u201cBlockchain Bandit\u201d has been a notorious figure in the crypto world, known for exploiting weak private keys and stealing over $90 million in cryptocurrency. Despite years of inactivity, the recent movement of stolen funds has reignited interest in this case.\n\nMeanwhile, the DAO hack remains one of the most significant incidents in crypto history, where a hacker exploited a smart contract vulnerability in the DAO, leading to the theft of over $50 million in Ether and resulting in a controversial hard fork in the ETH blockchain.\n\nOverall, the need for thorough investigation and clear answers is paramount. Samson Mow\u2019s stark comparison has undoubtedly put Ethereum\u2019s security, governance, and history under a microscope, with the crypto world now awaiting concrete evidence or rebuttals to these serious allegations.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,691.\n\nFeatured image from Forbes Colombia, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Larry Fink Of BlackRock Signals Shift With Ethereum ETF Interest - CryptoCoin.News",
        "content": "In a striking nod to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has recently expressed a strong interest in Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds). This move signifies a potential turning point in the digital finance landscape, particularly at a time when cryptocurrencies are making significant strides towards mainstream acceptance.\n\nFink, at the helm of the world\u2019s most colossal asset management firm, brings significant influence to the table. His interest in Ethereum ETFs not only underscores the cryptocurrency\u2019s escalating importance in digital finance but also hints at a possible shift in investment strategies favoring blockchain technologies. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in cryptocurrency as an asset class, not a currency,\u201d Fink remarked, a statement that echoes the sentiment of many modern investors who view digital currencies as viable long-term investments rather than mere transactional tools.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s pivot towards Ethereum ETFs is likely to set a precedent for other major financial institutions, potentially catalyzing a broader acceptance and integration of Ethereum in traditional financial portfolios. This would further cement Ethereum\u2019s role as a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency sphere.\n\nThe interest in Ethereum ETFs comes on the heels of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which has been met with a notable influx of \u2018smart money\u2019 into Ethereum. This trend is a testament to the growing confidence of savvy investors in Ethereum\u2019s potential. While decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes remain modest compared to centralized exchanges (CEXs), significant investment movements in major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are primarily driven by activities on CEXs.\n\nAs one analyst pointed out, \u201cOver the last 24 hours, we once again see ETH having the largest smart money inflows. However, it\u2019s important to understand that DEX volumes are still small compared to CEXs, and large price movements in large caps are likely due to volume on centralized exchanges, which we won\u2019t have oversight of.\u201d This statement highlights the importance of centralized exchanges in the current cryptocurrency landscape, despite the increasing popularity of decentralized platforms.\n\nFink\u2019s endorsement of Ethereum ETFs could mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market. It not only illustrates the growing acceptance of digital assets by established financial entities but also signals a broader shift in how these assets are perceived and utilized within the investment community.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the interest of major financial players like BlackRock in Ethereum ETFs is not just a passing trend but a clear indicator of the growing integration of digital assets into the fabric of global finance. This move could inspire confidence among investors and pave the way for a more diverse and robust cryptocurrency market, where Ethereum plays a leading role.\n\nIn conclusion, the attention Ethereum ETFs are receiving from influential figures like Larry Fink is a significant marker of the changing tides in the world of finance. As traditional and digital finance increasingly intersect, the role of cryptocurrencies in investment strategies is set to evolve, bringing new opportunities and challenges for investors and financial institutions alike. With BlackRock\u2019s potential entry into the Ethereum ETF market, the cryptocurrency landscape is poised for further growth and mainstream acceptance, heralding an exciting era for digital finance."

        "title": "ETC Price Jumps 34% As Ethereum Classic Trading Volumes Surge - CoinGape",
        "content": "With the approval of the US Bitcoin ETF, altcoins have registered a strong rally while Bitcoin rests. Though the Ethereum price surged 10%, its off-shoot Ethereum Classic (ETC) has registered even greater gains. The ETC price is up by a staggering 32% trading at $27.74 with a market cap of $4.05 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Classic Trading Volumes\n\nIn the wake of the Bitcoin ETF announcement, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has experienced a significant surge, surpassing the $26 mark for the first time since October 2022. The surge in trading volume suggests substantial interest from major traders.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the notable price movement, the sentiment surrounding Ethereum Classic remains neutral at present, as indicated by on-chain data provided by Santiment. Investors are closely monitoring the developments in the Ethereum Classic market following the recent Bitcoin-related news.\n\nThe ETC Price Bullish Breakout\n\nIn the weekly chart analysis, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has shown a departure from the lower high formation that characterized the previous bearish trend until 2022. After a year-long consolidation range throughout 2023, ETC struggled to surpass the resistance at $23. A recent resurgence, however, has resulted in a bullish breakout from the consolidation range, signaling a notable trend reversal for Ethereum Classic. This breakout is seen as a significant entry point for traders on the sidelines. The heightened market activity has contributed to a remarkable 250% increase in the 24-hour trading volume, supporting the sharp upward movement and hinting at the potential continuation of an uptrend. Currently trading at $28.43, Ethereum Classic has formed a bullish engulfing candle in the daily chart. The breakthrough above the $25 barrier positions Ethereum Classic for a sustained bullish rally. The rising sentiment in the market is fostering increased risk appetite among investors, contributing to the broader uptrend in the altcoin market. Under favorable market conditions, Ethereum Classic\u2019s price trajectory may lead to a breakout beyond multiple resistance levels, with a potential target of $40 on the horizon. However, should ETC struggle to maintain its momentum, a retest of the $25 level could be in the cards. Traders and investors are closely monitoring market dynamics to gauge the sustainability of Ethereum Classic\u2019s current bullish momentum.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "The rise of AI has brought new perspectives to the cryptocurrency market, making it easier for investors to conduct research and analysis.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s model ChatGPT has been the most-used analytical tool, offering objective price predictions for hundreds of coins and tokens.\n\nThis article explores ChatGPT\u2019s price forecasts for three trending cryptos, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Minetrix, discussing whether they could be in line for a lucrative 2024.\n\nChatGPT Predicts Bitcoin Cash Could See Strong Gains in 2024\n\nThe first cryptocurrency that ChatGPT highlighted is Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is up 24% in the past seven days.\n\nWith BCH currently trading at $295, the AI model considered recent market-moving events like the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nChatGPT states these ETF approvals will likely stir up positive sentiment across the crypto sector, presenting potential upside for major altcoins like BCH.\n\nSpecifically, ChatGPT predicts the regulatory green light for Bitcoin ETFs may spur increased retail and institutional demand into the broader crypto market.\n\nAs a prominent fork of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash stands to benefit from this rising interest.\n\nIf these bullish trends continue, ChatGPT projects BCH could climb to a price range between $350 and $450 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, the model notes that BCH could see even greater gains if its own fundamental developments and real-world usage as a payments coin continue growing.\n\nChatGPT Forecasts Ethereum Classic Price Nearly Double After Upcoming Hard Fork\n\nMoving on to Ethereum Classic (ETC), ChatGPT has taken a bullish stance on the original Ethereum chain and its prospects in 2024.\n\nWith ETC changing hands at $29, the model noted impressive one-week gains of 47% leading into its forecast.\n\nChatGPT also highlighted ETC\u2019s upcoming hard fork, scheduled for February, which aims to boost compatibility between Ethereum Classic\u2019s EVM and the dominant Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAccording to the AI model, successfully implementing this hard fork could significantly increase ETC\u2019s utility among decentralized app developers.\n\nIf more DeFi and Web3 projects build on a fork aligned with the Ethereum Classic, ChatGPT predicts increased adoption and investment inflows could push ETC to between $35 and $50 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, the model caveats its prediction on the smooth technical execution of the upcoming hard fork upgrade.\n\nIf network instability were to occur, some enthusiasm towards Ethereum Classic could evaporate \u2013 hurting the ETC price.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s Stake-to-Mine Model Could Fuel 681% Growth, According to ChatGPT\n\nAlongside Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic, a new player has emerged that ChatGPT is also bullish on \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nBitcoin Minetrix aims to reshape the mining sphere by utilizing a \u201cStake-to-Mine\u201d model, where users can stake their BTCMTX tokens and earn cloud mining credits.\n\nThese credits can then provide power to mine Bitcoin virtually.\n\nThis breakthrough makes Bitcoin mining accessible to anyone without the high barriers to entry of specialized gear or software.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix also has a high-yield staking protocol for BTCMTX \u2013 with more than 531 million tokens staked already.\n\nGiven its innovative Stake-to-Mine features, ChatGPT is optimistic about Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s growth potential.\n\nWith BTCMTX on offer for $0.0128 in its ongoing presale, the project has already raised over $8.2 million, indicating strong investor demand.\n\nLooking ahead, ChatGPT sees several catalysts that could push BTCMTX\u2019s price higher in 2024.\n\nThese include the simplicity of cloud mining and high APY staking rewards, which may attract new and experienced investors.\n\nConsidering these growth factors, ChatGPT predicts that if Bitcoin Minetrix can ride post-listing momentum and investor interest, the BTCMTX price could reach $0.05 to $0.10 by the end of the year.\n\nShould this scenario play out, it would mean returns of 290% and 681% for those who invest in the presale today.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ethereum surged by 5% amid Bitcoin ETF excitement.\n\nVitalik Buterin proposed a gas limit increase for Ethereum\u2019s network efficiency.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market experienced a surge in excitement as the Bitcoin spot ETF approval resonated across various assets. Following this, Ethereum [ETH] recorded a 5% price growth within the last 24 hours, fueled by the positive sentiment in the market.\n\nHowever, what are the chances of an Ethereum ETF getting approved?\n\nETF saga continues\n\nAnticipation is building around the looming deadline for Ethereum\u2019s ETF decision, set for 23rd May with VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nWith the approval of 11 BTC ETFs, it is expected that ETH ETFs would have a sure shot at SEC\u2019s approval. The approval is also expected to have a palpable impact on the state of ETH.\n\nThere could be also be massive accumulation of ETH prior to the approval.\n\nVitalik chimes in\n\nSeparately, in a recent Reddit ask-me-anything (AMA) session hosted by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s research team on 10th January, Vitalik Buterin brought attention to the gas limit, proposing a modest increase to enhance network throughput.\n\nButerin highlighted the nearly three-year period during which the gas limit remained static, suggesting that a 33% increase to around 40 million from the current 30 million could contribute to the network\u2019s efficiency.\n\nThis adjustment aligns with Buterin\u2019s vision for maintaining Ethereum\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nThe proposed increase in the gas limit holds significant implications for Ethereum, as it aims to address scalability challenges and enhance the overall performance of the network.\n\nBy accommodating more transactions within each block, Ethereum can potentially lower transaction fees and improve user experience. Only time will tell whether this will help Ethereum attract more users to its network.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum was trading at $2,415.34, reflecting a 5.07% price growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nMoreover, there was a surge in trading volume and an increased network growth. This showed that the spike in ETH\u2019s price was being driven by new addresses.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nHowever, the velocity at which ETH was trading had declined which meant that the number of addresses transferring their ETH declined materially in the last few days.\n\nThis could act as a hindrance in the price movement of ETH going forward.\n\nSource: Santiment"

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction: Anticipating a $4k Target ETH as ETF Approvals Loom in 2024 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has recently witnessed a significant upswing, climbing by 8.5% in just 24 hours and registering a 15% increase over the past week. This surge has propelled ETH past the $2,500 mark, a level not seen since May 2022. The momentum came after the Bitcoin spot ETF approval, sparking investor speculation about the imminent approval of Ethereum\u2019s spot ETFs.\n\nEthereum price fluctuated between $2,200 and $2,300 in the past few days, with buying and selling pressure struggling to establish a clear market direction. However, the market soon gained traction, allowing ETH to break free from this range; currently, ETH price is hovering at $2,641. Despite encountering resistance at $2,450 and experiencing a brief correction, the bulls regained control, pushing the price above $2,600.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnticipation of Ethereum ETFs Fuels Market Optimism\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is optimistic following the historic approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 10, 2024. This development has heightened expectations for the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs later in the year. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates a 70% chance of Ethereum ETF approval by May, further fueling market enthusiasm.\n\nNew deadline to obsess over just dropped May 23rd is the final deadline for decision on VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF pic.twitter.com/dgi5EVbPeQ \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) January 10, 2024\n\nIf the bulls maintain their momentum and push Ethereum past the $2,700 resistance level, the course could be clear for Ethereum price to test the $3,000 mark. Sustaining this level could set the stage for an attempt to breach the $4,000 resistance in the near future. Conversely, if bearish trends prevail, Ethereum could see a decline, testing support levels at $2,500 and potentially dropping to $2,450 by the weekend.\n\nEthereum Technical Indicators Point to Bullish Trends\n\nEthereum\u2019s market behavior reinforces the bullish sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a rising green histogram, signaling a dominance of buying pressure over selling. The MACD and signal lines are currently above the zero line, indicating bullish pressure. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator stands at a positive 0.42, suggesting a strong buying trend.\n\nThe four-hour technical indicators also support this bullish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has crossed overbought territory, surpassing 70, indicating strong buying pressure. Furthermore, the 20 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned above the 50 EMA, confirming the market\u2019s bullish dominance. Most of the moving averages and oscillators in the four-hour chart indicate buying pressure, suggesting a continued upward trend for the asset in the short term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Binance Coin.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nThis week, Ethereum broke above the resistance at $2,500 and, in the process, increased by 14.7%. This is a spectacular performance, considering it came in the context of the Bitcoin ETF listing being approved.\n\nThis means Ethereum appears undervalued in the eyes of investors and maybe the next big cryptocurrency to be listed later this year.\n\nLooking ahead, ETH is found in a rally and may not stop until it reaches the current target of $3,000. The support is now at $2,500.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nXRP struggled this week and booked only a 3% price increase while many Ethereum-based tokens rallied in double digits.\n\nBuyers don\u2019t appear that interested right now since most of the action was taken by the two market leaders, BTC and ETH.\n\nLooking ahead, XRP remains in a channel with key support at 54 cents and key resistance at 68 cents. Until one of these two levels breaks, major moves seem less likely.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano\u2019s correction ended this week, and buyers managed to re-test the key resistance at 60 cents. However, they failed to break it. Still, ADA booked a 4% price increase.\n\nThe support at 46 cents held strong, and if buyers persist, it may not be tested again as they have another go at the key resistance.\n\nLooking ahead, ADA remains competitive and appears keen to break higher. Watch the key resistance, as that will be decisive in where the price goes next.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana failed to break the resistance at $104 and lost 3% of its valuation this week. This is a show of weakness, while other altcoins performed much better.\n\nIt appears that SOL had its moment in late 2023 and is now struggling to gather the same momentum. The support is found at $78.\n\nLooking ahead, as long as buyers can\u2019t break above $104, Solana will have a hard time making new highs.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin continues to hold well onto its recent gains but closes the week with a 3% loss. Despite this pullback, its price is still above $300 at the time of this article.\n\nThe nearest support is found at $260, and BNB may test it if sellers take over the price action.\n\nLooking ahead, Binance Coin is in an uptrend, with the most important target found at $360. If buyers persist, they could eventually reach that level after this pullback ends."

        "title": "What is Neon EVM (NEON): the first Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana - OKX",
        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is known to be a foundational element in blockchain technology. It enables secure and automated smart contract execution, underpins decentralized applications (DApps), and provides interoperability across many different crypto projects.\n\nThe technology's widespread adoption, security measures, and support for token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 contribute to its role in the Web3 ecosystem, particularly among decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nNeon EVM represents fresh evolution for EVM. The promise of Neon EVM lies in its ability to integrate EVM capabilities into the Solana (SOL) blockchain. This means developers can leverage the familiar EVM environment for deploying and executing smart contracts on Solana, combining the strengths of Ethereum's (ETH) ecosystem with the speed and scalability of Solana's blockchain. Meanwhile, the interoperability enabled through Neon EVM opens up new possibilities for DApps and supports the transfer of Ethereum's projects to the Solana network.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n\nTo understand the impact of Neon EVM, let's start with the basics. The EVM lies at the core of Ethereum's functionality, serving as a decentralized runtime environment that executes smart contracts. In other words, it translates code into tangible actions, powering the development of a diverse range of DApps.\n\nWhat does EVM-based mean?\n\nThe term 'EVM-based' refers to blockchain networks directly built using the EVM architecture, incorporating the EVM natively into their infrastructure. This direct integration provides one-to-one compatibility, allowing smart contracts written for Ethereum to execute on EVM-based networks. Ethereum-based projects can migrate effortlessly to these platforms, benefiting from the familiarity of the Ethereum environment.\n\nWhat does EVM-compatible mean?\n\nWhen a blockchain is labeled EVM-compatible, it means the chain follows EVM standards without being directly integrated with the core architecture. While EVM-based chains directly replicate Ethereum's Virtual Machine, EVM-compatible chains maintain compatibility with Ethereum's tooling and smart contract standards but might introduce additional features or optimizations.\n\nSimilar to EVM-based blockchains, developers benefit from a familiar environment, using Ethereum-compatible programming languages and tools, such as the widely familiar Solidity language. This compatibility also allows for interoperability, providing a smooth transition for projects between Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\nWhat is Neon EVM?\n\nNeon EVM is positioned as the first EVM on Solana, allowing developers to deploy EVM-compatible DApps on Solana with minimal reconfiguration. The platform enables DApps to process Ethereum-like transactions while embracing Solana's functionalities, including parallel execution of transactions and low gas fees.\n\nWith Neon EVM, developers can continue using familiar smart contract languages and Ethereum tools. This includes writing smart contracts in Solidity and Vyper, funding DApps with MetaMask, and deploying DApps on Solana through the Truffle environment, all while taking advantage of the efficiency of Solana transactions. This not only supports the transition for Ethereum developers but also potentially expands their reach by tapping into Solana's user base and accessing the platform's liquidity.\n\nNEON, the native utility and governance token, plays a broad role, from enabling transactions to decentralized governance through Neon DAO.\n\nHow does Neon EVM differ from Ethereum's EVM?\n\nOne difference between Neon EVM and Ethereum's EVM lies in the execution of transactions. While Ethereum's EVM executes smart contracts sequentially to maintain consistent and predictable outcomes, Neon EVM uses the parallel execution capability of Solana to enable smart contracts to be processed concurrently.\n\nTo allow for parallel transaction processing, Neon EVM bundles transactions and sends them to the Solana mainnet. Under ideal conditions, Neon EVM achieves a throughput of 4,500 transactions per second (TPS), surpassing Ethereum's general limit of around 1,500 TPS.\n\nHow does Neon EVM work?\n\nNeon EVM serves as a gateway for Ethereum-based applications to access the high transaction speeds and low transaction costs of Solana without changing its codebase. Here's an overview of the platform's key components and functionalities:\n\nNeon Proxy\n\nNeon Proxy allows for the migration of Ethereum DApps to the Solana blockchain. Acting as a bridge, Neon Proxy channels Ethereum-like transactions on the Solana network with minimal friction. This component packages Neon transactions, which represent Ethereum-style transactions, into Solana transactions. These packaged transactions are then processed on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its parallel execution capability and high throughput. Neon operators, responsible for running Neon Proxy servers, support this migration. They accept payments in NEON tokens and manage transactions within the Solana ecosystem using SOL.\n\nNeonScan\n\nNeonScan functions as both a block explorer and an analytics platform designed for users and developers. As a block explorer, NeonScan allows users to inspect and analyze transactions, blocks, and tokens associated with the Neon EVM on the Solana blockchain. This transparency provides users with a comprehensive view of the network's activity, allowing them to verify transactions, track token movements, and understand block information.\n\nNeonPass\n\nNeonPass is a tool that helps enable the transfer of ERC-20 tokens between the Solana and Neon EVM. This tool simplifies the cross-network cryptocurrency transfer process, allowing users to navigate the complexities with ease. Each transaction conducted through NeonPass incurs a gas fee, payable either in NEON or SOL tokens, depending on the originating network.\n\nNeon Faucet\n\nNeon Faucet is a service designed to help users obtain NEON and other ERC-20 test tokens. It's a resource for developers working within the Neon devnet, providing them with the necessary test tokens for application testing in a risk-free environment.\n\nBy using these tokens, Neon Faucet enhances the application development and testing processes on the Neon EVM platform before their deployment on the main network. Users looking to use Neon Faucet need to connect their crypto wallet to the service, which then allows them to access NEON and other ERC-20 test tokens for a thorough and secure testing experience.\n\nWho created Neon EVM?\n\nNeon EVM, developed by Neon Labs, operates under the oversight of the Neon Foundation for its development and governance. Marina Guryeva is the founder and CEO of Neon Labs and has been active in the blockchain space since 2015.\n\nGuryeva previously served as the Director of CyberFund, an investment platform for blockchain startups. In 2019, she assumed the role of Director at Commun, a blockchain-based social network. In 2021, Guryeva founded Neon Labs with the aim of integrating Solana's scalability and low transaction fees into the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNEON token: powering transactions and governance\n\nThe NEON token, native to the Neon EVM ecosystem, serves a dual role. It functions as a utility token, facilitating transactions on the Neon platform including transfers, DApp deployment, interactions within DApps, and more. Beyond transactions, NEON serves as a governance token, empowering holders to actively participate in decentralized decision-making processes through Neon DAO.\n\nThe final word\n\nNeon EVM's mission within the Solana ecosystem is clear: to harness Solana's capabilities while providing Ethereum developers with a platform that feels like home. This integration brings forth a new era of possibilities for developers seeking high-performance blockchain solutions. As Neon EVM looks ahead on its roadmap, the promise of continued innovation underscores its commitment to shaping a multi-chain future."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nIn a significant milestone for the Cardano ecosystem, Cardano (ADA) has emerged as a leader in wallet growth, outshining major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and (XRP).\n\nAccording to a post shared by on-chain analytics firm Santiment on Monday, the number of wallets holding ADA with more than zero coins surged by an impressive 38% over the past year, bringing the total to 4.5 million wallets. This places ADA ahead of other prominent cryptocurrencies, including XRP with a 26% growth, DOGE with a 22% growth, and even Bitcoin with a 32% growth in the number of wallets.\n\nNotably, the only cryptocurrency to surpass ADA in this metric was Ethereum (ETH), with a 54% growth and 112.1 million wallets.\n\nThese statistics indicate a growing interest and adoption of Cardano despite the ongoing struggle with FUD, as it successfully emerged from the harsh crypto winter.\n\nThat said, adding to Cardano\u2019s momentum has been its robust development activity on GitHub. According to data shared on Friday by CryptoDiffer, Cardano was seen to have taken a substantial lead over Ethereum in December, with an average daily GitHub commit size of 449 compared to Ethereum\u2019s 183, showcasing a 245% difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe implications of this active development are crucial for ADA\u2019s market performance. As Cardano attracted more developers, there was a heightened expectation of increased demand and usage for its native blockchain token, ADA.\n\nTurning attention to price performance, despite a short-term price fall of around 17% over the past week, the cryptocurrency has shown resilience and potential for further growth after a 75% growth in the past year. Presently, ADA is exhibiting a bullish trend on the weekly chart after successfully converting the critical $0.45- $0.46 resistance zone into solid support.\n\nThat said, Cardano\u2019s surge in wallet growth, coupled with its attractive development activity, growing community support and positive price performance, positions it as a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming months.\n\nAt press time, ADA was trading at $0.56, reflecting a modest 3.30% decrease over the last 24 hours. However, amidst this slight dip, the asset\u2019s trading surged by an impressive 60%, reaching approximately $597 million during the same period, indicating heightened trader activity and market engagement."

        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF launch was highlighted in an interview with CEO Larry Fink on CNBC. Fink, who had previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, now views it as a viable asset class, though not a potential currency. This change of stance aligns with BlackRock\u2019s broader strategy of embracing technological advancements in the financial sector, mainly through ETFs and the eventual tokenization of financial assets.\n\nIn his CNBC interview after the historic first day of trading for BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, Fink revealed a notable transformation in his perception of Bitcoin. Fink has evolved to see Bitcoin as an asset class similar to digital gold, suitable for wealth holding but not as a currency.\n\nFink\u2019s discussion with the CNBC host delved into the implications of Bitcoin\u2019s value, its comparison to gold, and its potential price trajectory. He emphasized that Bitcoin, like gold, is a haven asset that gains value amidst geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nHowever, unlike gold, Bitcoin has a near-fixed supply limit, enhancing its appeal as a store of value. When probed about predictions like Cathie Wood\u2019s that foresee Bitcoin reaching $600,000 or more, Fink refrained from speculating on specific valuations, focusing instead on the asset\u2019s potential for wealth preservation.\n\nThe conversation also touched on the broader implications of BlackRock\u2019s ETF initiative. Fink sees ETFs as the first step in a technological revolution in financial markets, with the tokenization of financial assets being the next phase.\n\nThis vision, he believes, aligns with BlackRock\u2019s successful history of integrating ETFs into various asset classes, demonstrating a consistent strategy of leveraging technology to transform the financial landscape.\n\nFink\u2019s comments on the first day\u2019s inflows into the Bitcoin ETF were positive, with BlackRock capturing significant market interest. He highlighted the competitive advantage of ETFs over traditional trusts, noting the lower fees associated with ETFs. This aspect, coupled with the tax implications of transferring assets from trusts like Grayscale to other, lower-fee ETFs, presents both challenges and opportunities in the evolving cryptocurrency market.\n\nFinally, when discussing the future of crypto ETFs, Fink expressed optimism about the potential for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum to be included in ETF offerings.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of tokenization in enhancing transparency and reducing corruption in financial transactions, pointing to a future where financial assets and identities are tokenized, thus creating a more secure and efficient financial system. He concluded:\n\n\u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization, and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going\u2026 This eliminates all corruption by having a tokenized system.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 is expected to play a crucial role, as it has historically led to significant increases in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nTo provide you with a list of the top cryptocurrencies today, we\u2019ve scoured the web, gathering information from trusted Web3 sources and top crypto charts.\n\nThe Ultimate List of Top Cryptocurrencies Today\n\nApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax has swiftly risen to prominence as a frontrunner in the meme coin arena. Its unique \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d staking feature allows token holders to boost their preferred entities and potentially earn rewards. The coin\u2019s standout feature includes instant token access for eligible presale buyers, facilitating immediate staking opportunities.\n\nWith an ongoing presale generating heightened anticipation, ApeMax is positioned as a key player in the market, having gained 9,000 token holders and billions of tokens staked on the ApeMax platform already.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nAs the pioneer of crypto, Bitcoin continues to be the digital gold standard, boasting unparalleled security and decentralization. Bitcoin functions as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system independent of central banks. This week, BTC has reached $47,000 for the first time since April 2022.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nMaintaining its status as the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum spearheads the smart contract revolution. Empowering decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, Ethereum\u2019s robust infrastructure remains at the forefront of NFTs and Web3 gaming, solidifying its relevance in the crypto space.\n\nBinance Coin (BNB)\n\nBinance Coin, representing the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, has proven resilient even during bearish market conditions. Binance Coin is now trading at $301.15 with a market cap of $45 billion.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSolana, a third-generation blockchain platform, utilizes PoS and PoH mechanisms to provide efficient smart contract functionality. Positioned as a potential \u201cEthereum rival\u201d, SOL stands out for its high speeds, low costs, and overall efficiency.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nRipple\u2019s cryptocurrency token, XRP, facilitates low-cost and instant cross-border fund transfers. Serving as a bridge currency for financial institutions to exchange both crypto and fiat currencies more cost-effectively, XRP remains a notable player in the crypto landscape.\n\nCardano (ADA)\n\nCardano, with its layered architecture and Ouroboros PoS consensus mechanism, focuses on scalability and security for smart contracts and DApps. Founded by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, Cardano continues to evolve with a market cap exceeding $18 billion.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX)\n\nAvalanche provides a decentralized infrastructure for building DApps and executing smart contracts. Distinguished by its use of subnets, Avalanche\u2019s child chains offer flexibility in launching dedicated blockchains for diverse use cases.\n\nWhat Will be the Next Big Crypto in 2024?\n\nMany tokens, including newcomers like ApeMax, are garnering increased attention. However, predicting the next standout coin in 2024 is challenging. The dynamics of crypto, shaped by external influences, introduce an element of uncertainty to the trajectory of any given token.\n\nWill ApeMax Reach $1?\n\nThe potential $1 milestone by ApeMax remains speculative, with its value trajectory being subject to factors such as market demand and circulating supply. Despite these uncertainties, ApeMax stands out as a distinctive player in the crypto market, thanks to its ongoing presale momentum and innovative tokenomics.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nAs we navigate through 2024, the crypto market shows signs of dynamism fueled by bullish sentiment. ApeMax, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other innovative coins, exemplifies the continuous creativity within the industry.\n\nHowever, it is imperative for crypto enthusiasts to conduct thorough and independent research and consider the associated risks and volatility of the crypto space. This article does not offer crypto or financial advice. For those interested in ApeMax, please be aware of geographical purchase restrictions, particularly in the US, Canada, and other restricted regions.

        "title": "Optimism (OP) Earns High Praise from Vitalik Buterin for $100M Public Goods Initiative - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "Optimism (OP) Earns High Praise from Vitalik Buterin for $100M Public Goods Initiative Jessie A Ellis Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin praised Optimism for distributing over $100 million in RetroPGF Round 3, emphasizing its role in funding public goods and supporting the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin has applauded the efforts of Optimism for their RetroPGF Round 3 initiative. This round saw an impressive distribution of over $100 million to 501 contributors, marking a pivotal moment for the funding of public goods within the blockchain space.\n\nOptimism's Innovative Approach to Funding\n\nOptimism has taken a novel approach to supporting the development of public goods through the Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program. This initiative rewards contributions that have a lasting positive impact on the Optimism ecosystem and, by extension, the broader Ethereum network. The third round of this program, known as RetroPGF Round 3, was particularly noteworthy for its scale and impact.\n\nVitalik Buterin's Endorsement\n\nVitalik Buterin, a prominent figure in the crypto community, has recognized and praised the endeavors of Optimism. His comments underline the significance of funding mechanisms that support developers and contributors who are engaged in building public infrastructure, especially those who do so without a traditional business model. Buterin's commendation has brought considerable attention to Optimism's efforts and highlights the importance of funding public goods in the blockchain domain.\n\nThe Impact and Reach of RetroPGF Round 3\n\nIn RetroPGF Round 3, Optimism allocated 30 million OP tokens to a diverse group of contributors, including builders, writers, creators, educators, and other contributors within the Optimism ecosystem. These awardees were recognized for their contributions across four critical categories: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer Ecosystem, and End User Experience and Adoption.\n\nOptimism's Contribution to the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nOptimism plays a crucial role in the Ethereum ecosystem by providing layer-2 scaling solutions. This technology enhances the performance of Ethereum by facilitating faster and cheaper transactions. The funding and support provided through programs like RetroPGF are vital for the continued growth and development of such technological innovations.\n\nDespite the positive news and Buterin's endorsement, the market response to Optimism's native token (OP) has been somewhat muted, with a slight dip in its value. However, this does not detract from the long-term significance of Optimism's initiatives for the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe successful execution of Optimism\u2019s RetroPGF Round 3 is a testament to the evolving landscape of blockchain funding and development. It not only demonstrates the potential of community-driven support mechanisms but also signifies a broader shift towards recognizing and valuing public goods within the blockchain space. As the industry continues to grow, the efforts of platforms like Optimism in supporting the backbone of the Ethereum network will likely become increasingly important.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nIf historical analogs continue to hold true, and we have no evidence at this time that they would not, Ethereum is all set to take the crypto leadership mantle now that spot Bitcoin ETFs have begun trading.\n\n$1B in 4 mins of Bitcoin ETF trading https://t.co/Jq1Q64GvXJ \u2014 On-Chain College (@OnChainCollege) January 11, 2024\n\nThe cumulative volume of spot Bitcoin ETFs hit $1 billion in just the first four minutes of trading! This is a phenomenal level of activity, even against already-elevated expectations.\n\nWhat's more, Bitcoin has now hit a new 2024 high, having zoomed past the $48,000 price level and quickly approaching the $49,000 handle.\n\nThe ETFs open up new institutional flows that waited for regulatory and SEC approval. It's a green flag. But there's even more. The ETFs were only approved for CASH subscriptions (not in-kind). So every purchase takes more Bitcoin off the market. This metric is going higher. \u2014 Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) January 11, 2024\n\nFor the benefit of those who are still not sure how the launch of these spot Bitcoin ETFs affects the world's preeminent cryptocurrency, every unit of these ETFs that is purchased translates into actual Bitcoin purchases in real-time, barring settlement-related delays.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 ETF approval could send Bitcoin to $60,000 near term - deVere's Green Nigel Green, a long-term cryptocurrency advocate and CEO of the deVere Group, sees the landmark SEC approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday sending the cryptocurrency higher - perhaps to $60,000 as\u2026 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 11, 2024\n\nIt is hardly a surprise, therefore, that bullish Bitcoin projections just keep rolling past analyst commentaries. DeVerre's Nigel Green now expects the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to hit the $60,000 price level as soon as March 2024, well ahead of the halving event in April, when Bitcoin's mining reward will again be cut in half in what is a regular 4-year cycle.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 CAHTIE WOOD: BASE CASE FOR #BITCOIN IS $600,000 RANGE, BULL CASE IS $1.5M BY 2030 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) January 11, 2024\n\nAdditionally, ARK Invest's Cathie Wood seems to have stolen the limelight for ultra-bullish projections by predicting that Bitcoin is expected to hit the $600,000 price level by 2030 in her base case scenario, and a whopping $1.5 million in the bullish case.\n\nWhen the #Bitcoin futures launched in 2017, the coin that went up 100% within weeks was #Ethereum When the Coinbase IPO launched in 2021, the count that went up 80% within weeks was #Ethereum#Bitcoin put in tops on both events ($20k+$64k), & proceeded to dump after \u2014 Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) December 22, 2023\n\nNonetheless, we've witnessed these manic times in the crypto world a number of times already over the past decade, and each time Ethereum was able to outrun Bitcoin in the ultra-bullish phase of the cycle. In the aftermath of the launch of Bitcoin futures in 2017, Ethereum went up around 100 percent within the next few weeks. When Coinbase went public in 2021, Ethereum rallied by around 80 percent in the immediate aftermath.\n\nThe #Ethereum ETF will draw more interest and excitement than the BTC ETF leading into it Its just simply based on timing, post-halving is a much more bullish time period which means market participants likely grow exponentially between now and then Bitcoin will do great to \u2014 Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) January 10, 2024\n\nOf course, spot Ethereum ETFs are also now expected to launch by May 2024, just around the time when the euphoria around Bitcoin's halving event would be peaking.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 More big whales are withdrawing $ETH from #Binance in the past hours. \u2705 Join the #SpotOnChain website and mobile app for more updates about whales now: https://t.co/UV6E05ZjXZ https://t.co/OZ1Jk42Qkq pic.twitter.com/Ob6183DpNz \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) January 11, 2024\n\nBased on the historical analogs, we can predict with a fair amount of confidence that Ethereum's time to shine is now approaching. And, crypto whales are already positioning for this eventuality.\n\nDo you think Bitcoin is about to be upstaged by Ethereum? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, briefly breached the $47,000 mark as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While this is considered to be a major win for crypto, it is largely being speculated that Ethereum (ETH) ETFs could be next on the table, as the coin touched a 20-month high of $2,500 before climbing up to $2,600.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.76 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.25 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $46,030.72, registering a 24-hour dip of 0.90 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. According to Indian exchange WazirX, BTC price stood at Rs 40.80 lakh.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Today\n\nETH price stood at $2,587.46, marking a 24-hour dip of 1.10 percent at the time of writing. As per WazirX, Ethereum price in India stood at Rs 2.29 lakh.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Price Today\n\nDOGE registered a 24-hour dip of 0.20 percent, as per CoinMarketCap data, currently priced at $0.08375. As per WazirX, Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs 7.46.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) Price Today\n\nLitecoin saw a 24-hour gain of 2.20 percent. At the time of writing, it was trading at $72.93.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 8,750.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (January 12)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS)\n\nPrice: $22.59\n\n24-hour gain: 24.84 percent\n\nSui (SUI)\n\nPrice: $1.07\n\n24-hour gain: 21.07 percent\n\nFTX Token (FTT)\n\nPrice: $3.07\n\n24-hour gain: 15.21 percent\n\nTezos (XTZ)\n\nPrice: $1.09\n\n24-hour gain: 14 percent\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nPrice: $29.50\n\n24-hour gain: 9.25 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (January 12)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nBeam (BEAM)\n\nPrice: $0.01901\n\n24-hour loss: 9.12 percent\n\nAkash Network (AKT)\n\nPrice: $2.94\n\n24-hour loss: 7.26 percent\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nPrice: $3.57\n\n24-hour loss: 6.76 percent\n\nWEMIX (WEMIX)\n\nPrice: $2.72\n\n24-hour loss: 6.16 percent\n\nInternet Computer (ICP)\n\nPrice: $12.82\n\n24-hour loss: 5.17 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin started with an upward trend, surpassing the $46,000 milestone and peaking at $49,000, only to experience a retracement that wiped out all gained momentum. Currently, Bitcoin consolidates around the $46,000 level, propelled by widespread liquidation of short positions across the market. Resistance is encountered at $47,300, with support maintaining a foothold at the $45,500 level. Optimism prevails following the recent launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and this positive shift is evident in the fear and greed index, indicating a market sentiment skewed towards greed. A market dynamic unfolds as bears and bulls engage in a battle for control.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, noted, \u201cAfter the start of BTC ETFs with a whopping collective trading volume of over $4.5 billion on Day 1, BTC (-0.7%) briefly inched close to $49k, hitting its 13-month high. The largest crypto was showcasing a rangebound performance of around $46.5k before peaking, which was followed by selling pressure and its return to the initial range. Even though the volatility has increased, the investor sentiment around BTC seems to have further strengthened, with a revision in analyst predictions including Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO. Cathie, who had previously predicted BTC\u2019s price to reach $1 million by 2030, has revised her prediction to $1.5 million in a bullish scenario. Other entities, such as the Standard Chartered Bank continue to predict BTC prices to be close to $200k by the end of 2025.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin (BTC) surged past $49,000, a level unseen since December 2021, as U.S.-based spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) began trading. The rally saw BTC climbing from below $46,000, peaking at $49,042 during the early U.S. trading hours. However, it subsequently retraced its gains, settling above $46,000 with a 1% increase over 24 hours. The ETF debut hasspurred significant BTC price volatility.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin recently surged to over $47,000, credited to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving 11 new Bitcoin ETFs. Despite stabilizing around $46,600, this marks significant mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency. Grayscale Investments, which won an SEC victory, plans to transform its $29 billion bitcoin trust into an ETF, which could boost investor confidence. \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" author Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin will hit $150,000 after SEC approval and defends Bitcoin, gold, and silver amid inflation fears. The 4-hour chart suggests a positive trend, with Bitcoin potentially challenging the $47,743 resistance. However, a drop below $45,026 could trigger a bearish reversal, highlighting the importance of market sentiment.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, the overall market displayed volatility, especially after the launch of the BTC spot ETF. Notably, Spot Bitcoin ETFs achieved a trading volume surpassing $4.5 billion on their first day, indicating positive market sentiment. BTC touched a new higher high at $49,000 but experienced a quick drop to $46,000, influenced by higher-than-expected CPI data, which had a negative impact on the market. BTC dominance has been on a declining trend, providing room for altcoins to gain traction. ETH is positioned near the key level of $2,640 and is currently consolidating below that resistance. The key support level for ETH stands at $2,450.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "The Power of Community in Crypto: The Self-Sustaining Economies of Avalanche, Toncoin and Meme Kombat - - Disrupt Africa",
        "content": "From its beginning, cryptocurrency aimed to be the currency for everyone and this birthed the concept of decentralised finance (DeFi) where individuals have complete ownership of their money. This money is stored on personal devices without third-party overseers like banks monitoring or creating it and it\u2019s the crypto communities that distribute and govern the currency.\n\nHowever, not all cryptocurrencies embody the qualities expected from DeFi. If a cryptocurrency fails to cater to the community\u2019s needs, it risks falling apart. This is why critics believe Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to reach its $1 price target\u2014due to a lack of community incentives for building a self-sustaining economy driven by community involvement.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Avalanche, Toncoin and Meme Kombat are successfully achieving self-sustaining economies. They offer enticing Web 3.0 ecosystems and passive income opportunities. The question is, which cryptocurrency stands out as the most enjoyable and profitable among this group?\n\nToncoin: The Crypto for Staking, Gaming, Collectibles and More\n\nToncoin (TON) stands as the native cryptocurrency of the TON network, creating a dynamic ecosystem designed to meet diverse community needs. Acting as the fuel for network operations, transactions and various activities like gaming and collectables\u2014Toncoin powers the TON blockchain.\n\nA standout feature of Toncoin lies in its staking functionality, providing users with the opportunity to earn passive income by actively participating in network security.\n\nValidators stake their Toncoin to uphold the blockchain, ensuring its stability and security. This system not only enhances the network\u2019s robustness but also rewards community members for their contributions.\n\nBeyond staking, Toncoin serves as a versatile asset. It acts as a processing fee for transactions and smart contracts and is used in payment services offered by applications built on the TON platform.\n\nMoreover, Toncoin plays a crucial role in TON\u2019s on-chain governance program, empowering community members to actively participate in decision-making processes.\n\nGenerate Passive Income in Avalanche\u2019s Dynamic Ecosystem\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) stands as a layer one blockchain positioned to compete with major players such as Ethereum, Cardano and Solana. With its architecture and impressive transaction output, Avalanche presents a compelling ecosystem where a community can earn passive income.\n\nUtilising the DeFi exchange platform Trader Joe, which is built on the Avalanche network, users can stake their crypto assets and receive JOE tokens as rewards.\n\nThis avenue for passive income has attracted numerous community members eager to benefit from Avalanche\u2019s staking payouts. In contrast to its counterparts, Avalanche boasts higher staking rewards, with AVAX averaging an 8.55% yearly payout compared to SOL\u2019s 5.5%.\n\nThe integration of Trader Joe with Avalanche\u2019s ecosystem grants community members easy access to decentralised finance. This access enables participation in various DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity provision.\n\nMeme Kombat\u2019s Unmatched Community Incentives in Crypto\\\n\nMeme Kombat (MK) is an Ethereum-based meme coin currently in its presale phase. MK aims to bring a blend of gaming, gambling, staking and decentralised finance (DeFi) into a singular platform that revolves around popular internet memes.\n\nOne of the standout features of MK is its approach to incorporating various meme types into its DeFi platform. Users can bet their native MK tokens on virtual battles between iconic meme characters like Doge, Pepe, Wojak and more.\n\nWinners not only receive payouts in MK but can also take advantage of the staking feature, enabling token holders to earn yields as high as 147% APY.\n\nMeme Kombat has witnessed remarkable demand during its presale, securing over $6.4 million out of its $10 million hard cap goal. The presale price, currently at $0.279, is subject to increase in subsequent stages until MK officially launches on Uniswap.\n\nReputable crypto analysts, including YouTubers Michael Wrubel and ClayBro, have recognised the project\u2019s potential, with predictions ranging from it being the \u201cnext 100x gaming meme crypto\u201d to potentially the \u201cbiggest meme gaming token of 2024.\u201d\n\nMeme Kombat stands out by providing staking APY on presale purchases, currently at an attractive 156%. This strategic move mitigates the risks associated with early pump-and-dump scenarios, offering a more stable and sustainable growth trajectory.\n\nBeyond being a meme coin, Meme Kombat distinguishes itself by combining GameFi, GambleFi and AI utilities. The project\u2019s core revolves around an AI-powered battle arena, where combats between various meme coin combinations take place.\n\nLeveraging the social media feud between meme coin communities, MK channels this rivalry onto its platform, driving organic demand for its native token.\n\nIn contrast to the anonymity often seen in meme coin projects, Meme Kombat\u2019s team, led by Matt Whitman and based in the Netherlands, is fully doxxed and prioritises transparency. The project has completed all necessary security measures, setting a new benchmark for accountability in the meme coin space.\n\nAs Meme Kombat approaches its official launch, the project is positioned to create a unique space within the crypto community, combining entertainment, utility and a strong sense of community involvement.\n\nEmbracing Community Empowerment in Crypto\n\nThe success stories of Avalanche, Toncoin and Meme Kombat explain how thriving communities contribute to the creation of self-sustaining economies within the crypto space.\n\nToncoin\u2019s dynamic ecosystem, driven by staking, gaming and collectibles, highlights the importance of community engagement. By actively participating in network security, users not only contribute to the stability of the TON blockchain but also earn passive income, reinforcing the symbiotic relationship between the project and its community.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s ecosystem offers higher staking rewards and access to decentralised finance through Trader Joe. The platform provides a space for users to stake their assets and earn JOE tokens.\n\nMeme Kombat takes community incentives to the next level by infusing entertainment and competition into its DeFi platform. The project\u2019s innovative approach to meme battles, staking incentives and transparent team practices set a precedent for responsible and engaging community development in the meme coin space.\n\nYou can enter the Meme Kombat presale on the Ethereum chain using either ETH or USDT. Alternatively, on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), participation is possible with USDT. It\u2019s important to note that $MK is set to be launched on the Ethereum chain. Therefore, if you choose to enter the presale on BSC, remember that you will need to claim your tokens on the Ethereum chain."

        "title": "Best Coins to Buy in the Bull Run: Riding the Crypto Bull Run with ApeMax, Helium, Tectum, Celestia, Chainlink, Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin - - Disrupt Africa",
        "content": "As 2024 dawns, the cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement for a potential upcoming bull run, fueled by the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving. This phase of burgeoning possibilities has attracted the gaze of both seasoned and novice crypto enthusiasts, looking to ride the wave if the bull run charges for an explosive year.\n\nIn this vibrant landscape, explore the most promising cryptocurrencies: ApeMax, Helium, Tectum, Celestia, Chainlink, Solana, Ethereum, and the iconic Bitcoin. Each of these coins offers unique value to the evolving crypto world. Leveraging the latest market trends and data, we delve into the reasons behind their popularity within the crypto community.\n\n1. ApeMax (APEMAX)\n\nApeMax, a rising meme coin in crypto, stands out for innovation and a growing community. Introducing the pioneering \u201cBoost-to-Earn\u201d staking feature, ApeMax has over 9,000 token holders and 3.5 billion staked tokens. This feature allows ApeMax holders to earn rewards by staking their tokens on preferred entities, offering immediate utility and engagement opportunities seldom seen in presale coins. Eligible early adopters can swiftly engage in staking after purchasing even during the presale phase.\n\n2. Helium (HNT)\n\nHelium (HNT) is a decentralized blockchain network catering to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Introduced in July 2019, the Helium mainnet supports communication among low-powered wireless devices, facilitating data transmission across its node network.\n\n3. Tectum (TET)\n\nTectum is known for its high-speed, scalable blockchain technology, focusing on creating a seamless user experience. It aims to provide solutions for real-world applications by offering fast transaction speeds with minimal fees.\n\n4. Celestia (TIA)\n\nA modular blockchain platform, Celestia is designed for interoperability and scalability. It stands out by offloading computation to specialized rollup chains, aiming to create a more efficient \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d for blockchain communication.\n\n5. Chainklink (LINK)\n\nA powerhouse oracle network, Chainlink bridges the gap between blockchain contracts and real-world data, enabling secure and reliable interactions beyond the chain. Its widespread adoption and deep integration with DeFi protocols position it as a key player in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\n6. Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana is renowned for its incredible speed and low transaction costs, boasting the ability to process thousands of transactions per second (TPS). Solana\u2019s rapidity stems from its distinctive hybrid consensus mechanism, merging Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for energy efficiency with a novel Proof-of-History (PoH) algorithm.\n\n7. Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, a trailblazer in blockchain technology, transformed the landscape with smart contracts \u2013 self-executing agreements that activate once preset conditions are met. This breakthrough enabled diverse applications, from digital marketplaces to decentralized finance (DeFi), securing Ethereum\u2019s status as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\n8. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin, known as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d is the first cryptocurrency, established in 2009 to enable decentralized, peer-to-peer financial transactions. Bitcoin\u2019s independence from central authorities, secure blockchain-based transaction recording, and limited supply of 21 million coins contribute to its value and potential inflation resistance.\n\nWhy does Bitcoin influence when the crypto bull run will happen?\n\nAlthough it is impossible to predict if and when a crypto bull run will happen, Bitcoin often influences the timing and sentiment around a crypto bull run because it is the leading and most established cryptocurrency. As the pioneer and most widely recognized digital currency, Bitcoin tends to set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market. A Bitcoin bull run can impact other innovative altcoins like ApeMax.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs talks of an upcoming crypto surge grow louder, attention shifts towards diverse digital currencies. Beyond the big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, other innovative altcoins like ApeMax, Celestia, Solana, and many more, emerge as noteworthy contenders, each catering to the niches of their community.\n\nYet, amidst the excitement, it\u2019s crucial for crypto enthusiasts to approach this landscape with caution and thorough research. Understanding the risks inherent to cryptocurrencies is essential. The crypto market\u2019s volatility and factors like regulatory shifts, technological advancements, and global economic trends significantly influence its direction. Predicting which digital currencies will shine remains uncertain.\n\nFor comprehensive details on ApeMax, refer to the official website and ensure compliance with geographical limitations before any purchase."

        "title": "Investor's Top Crypto Staking Options in 2024: Earn Passive Income with Avalanche, Ethereum and Bitcoin Minetrix - TechCabal",
        "content": "Passive income generation is a constant pursuit for cryptocurrency investors. While traditional staking options like Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) have been popular choices, a new contender has emerged with an intriguing Stake-to-Mine method \u2013 Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX).\n\nCan Bitcoin Minetrix outperform the staking options of Cardano and Avalanche, leading to exciting possibilities for passive income in the crypto world?\n\n[ad]\n\nEthereum\u2019s New Way to Earn Passive Income\n\nEthereum, the leading blockchain network, has recently embraced a significant change that opens up new financial opportunities for a wider audience.\n\nIn the past, Ethereum faced criticism for not shifting away from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism which they had used since inception. However, the network has evolved to embrace Proof-of-Stake (PoS), allowing users to earn passive income with a variety of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith PoS, users can become validators by locking their assets into a pool for validation. In return for participating in the validation process, users receive interest in the form of staked rewards, creating a straightforward method for generating passive income.\n\nStaking not only provides a way to earn in bullish markets but also offers the potential to profit during bearish periods, as stakers can have their crypto ready to trade when the market becomes favourable.\n\nOne concern with staking has been the lack of access to locked crypto until the validation process is complete. Ethereum addresses this issue with liquid staking. When users stake ETH, they receive a liquid token version that can be freely traded while still allowing them to earn passive income through staking.\n\nThis innovative approach makes staking more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience interested in exploring the world of passive income through cryptocurrencies.\n\nStaking Opportunities with Avalanche\u2019s Trader Joe\n\nAvalanche, a layer-1 blockchain network launched in 2020, is stepping up to compete with well-known players like Ethereum, Cardano and Solana. While Avalanche might not claim faster transaction speeds than Solana, it distinguishes itself by offering higher staking payouts. AVAX boasts an average yearly payout of 8.55%, outperforming SOL\u2019s 5.5% yearly payout.\n\nTrader Joe, a DeFi exchange platform built on Avalanche, offers a range of activities including token swapping, yield farming, staking, borrowing, lending and even featuring an NFT marketplace.\n\nUsers can passively earn JOE tokens, the platform\u2019s native currency, by staking crypto to provide liquidity. Thanks to Avalanche\u2019s appealing staking payouts, Trader Joe has become a go-to destination for those seeking to earn passive income that can be easily traded for various currencies.\n\n[ad]\n\nBitcoin Minetrix: A Simplified Path to Bitcoin Mining?\n\nTraditional Bitcoin mining involves complex hardware setups and high energy consumption, often keeping it out of reach for many crypto enthusiasts, but Bitcoin Minetrix aims to change this with its \u2018Stake-to-Mine\u2019 model, offering a user-friendly and potentially lucrative alternative.\n\nInstead of battling algorithms with expensive rigs, Bitcoin Minetrix lets you stake the project\u2019s native token, BTCMTX. This unlocks access to cloud mining resources that do the heavy lifting, eliminating the need for technical expertise and hefty upfront costs.\n\nThis approach boasts several advantages:\n\nAccessibility: Opens Bitcoin mining to a broader audience, democratising the process and removing technological barriers.\n\nEfficiency: Eliminates the need for expensive hardware and reduces energy consumption.\n\nDouble Rewards: Earn two income streams \u2013 potential staking rewards of up to 87% annually and a share of the mining profits.\n\nSecurity & Transparency: The token-based system offers higher levels of decentralisation and security compared to standard cloud mining services.\n\nWith Bitcoin Minetrix\u2019s features and user-friendly approach, it presents itself as a more efficient and accessible path to mining crypto than traditional Bitcoin mining methods.\n\nNew Choices for Crypto Passive Income: Stake-to-Mine vs. Staking\n\nAs the crypto market grows, so do the ways to earn passive income within it. Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake and the success of staking platforms like Avalanche demonstrate the growing demand for these options.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix adds a new dimension to this discussion with its Stake-to-Mine model, offering a simplified and more inclusive approach to Bitcoin mining. The innovative concept of earning Bitcoin rewards through staking BTCMTX tokens challenges the status quo and provides an alternative path for those looking to benefit from the potential crypto boom.\n\n[ad]\n\nWhile traditional staking methods provide a reliable means of earning passive income, the emergence of Stake-to-Mine models introduces exciting possibilities.\n\nFor those seeking substantial growth, directing your focus towards presale tokens such as Bitcoin Minetrix presents a strategic choice. This token carries the potential for a remarkable surge of 50x \u2013 100x. As it approaches its final presale stage, now is a prime moment for investors to get in early.\n\nShare this article"

        "title": "Rebel Satoshi: The new meme gem sparking interest among traditional Bitcoin and Ethereum classic investors - Cyprus Mail",
        "content": "TLDR\n\nEthereum Classic will implement the \u2018Spiral Upgrade,\u2019 which should happen on January 31, 2024.\n\nAn anonymous user sends $1.2 million of BTC to destination addresses linked to Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nRebel Satoshi is set to fuse rebellious themes and meme culture to inspire a DeFi movement.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) remain the \u2018OGs\u2019 of crypto with years of popularity. However, their die-hard investors have found an interesting alternative in the meme gem, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ).\n\nInterestingly, the project is inspired by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, using their defiant spirit to fuel the decentralized finance movement. Let\u2019s learn more about Rebel Satoshi, which is only a few weeks away from going live officially.\n\nRebel Satoshi rallies for decentralized finance movement\n\nRebel Satoshi is a meme coin blending rebellious themes and whimsiness with a much-desired decentralized finance movement. The project\u2019s heroes include rebellious figures, Satoshi Nakamoto and Guy Fawkes. Ultimately, Rebel Satoshi represents the \u2018Robin Hood\u2019 of crypto, transferring wealth from oppressive elites to the masses.\n\nRebel Satoshi will also be a place of fun and enticing perks while celebrating rebellion and fostering defiance. The amusement starts with interactive quests, virtual gatherings, and the Rebel Meme Hall of Fame. Here, Rebel Satoshi\u2018s community members can express their best-voted \u2018Recusant\u2019 memes for laughs and popularity.\n\nThis part of Rebel Satoshi is exclusive to the early adopters with the greatest holdings of the $RBLZ token. Like Bitcoin, it has a fixed supply (of 250 million), going against the grain of inflationary traditional currencies. It provides benefits like staking rewards and entry into the Rebel Artefacts Vault NFT marketplace. Moreover, certain holders receive governance power and insider updates.\n\nUsers can own $RBLZ for $0.025 in the second-to-last round of Rebel Satoshi\u2018s presale. $RBLZ has risen 100% from $0.010 in the first round, a testament to the meme coin\u2019s demand.\n\nThe presale will conclude next month, signaling the listing of $RBLZ on multiple exchanges. $RBLZ has also risen 25% to $0.025 by this time.\n\nNow, let\u2019s study the latest news for Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic.\n\nGenesis Wallet linked to Satoshi Nakamoto receives $1.2 million in BTC\n\nEvery once in a while, the mystery of the blockchain\u2019s creator re-captivates enthusiasts. Transactions believed to be linked to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original wallet have crept up, the most recent being on January 5, 2024. An anonymous user sent 26.9 million BTC (worth about $1.2 million) to the \u2018genesis block\u2019 wallet. This destination address has been inactive since 2010, when Nakamoto disappeared.\n\nThe amount of this transaction is what has the Bitcoin community curious. Coinbase head of product Conor Grogan on X/Twitter said, \u201cEither Satoshi woke up, bought 27 Bitcoin from Binance, and deposited into their wallet, or someone just burned a million dollars.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin continues to make highs, the most recent of which is $47,355 (now worth $46,560). BTC is up 12% since the start of 2024 from a low of $41,445. Moreover, estimates indicate it could reach at least $55,000 by 2025.\n\nEthereum Classic prepares for \u2018spiral\u2019 hard fork\n\nEthereum Classic continues to be under the radar, as evidenced by its on-chain metrics. The blockchain has only surpassed six figures in daily transactions four times since launching in 2015. The most recent peak was on November 26, 2023, reaching 180,507. This figure is now at 35,022.\n\nRegardless, Ethereum Classic is preparing for a hard fork named the \u2018Spiral Upgrade.\u2019 The update is expected on January 31, 2024, at block 19,250,000. According to the developers, the Spiral upgrade will \u2018bring the ETC Network to parity with upstream EVM standards, facilitating contract development and migration.\u2019\n\nBased on chart performance, ETC is falling slightly out of favor in top altcoins, down 18% from $24.41 to $20.02. Still, many forecasts suggest it will climb to at least $35 by the start of next year.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 \u201cViews Expressed Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including NEO CYMED PUBLISHING LIMITED, which is the publishing company performing under the name Cyprus-Mail\u2026more"

        "title": "What Canadian investors need to know about bitcoin ETFs - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "Ethereum ETFs could be next in the U.S.: Invesco-Galaxy partnership Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy, joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss the launch of Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). He believes crypto products will thrive in Canada and the U.S.\n\nBitcoin made headlines this week after U.S. regulatory changes made investing in the cryptocurrency more accessible \u2013 and experts say investors should be knowledgeable about the industry and understand the risks before diving in to cryptocurrency and related products.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in bitcoin, with many opening trading platforms the next day.\n\nExperts and stakeholders believe the change is transformational for the industry and represents a major step towards legitimizing cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big day for (the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust), its shareholders, and really the whole bitcoin and crypto communities overall,\u201d Craig Salm, chief legal officer of Grayscale Investments, told BNN Bloomberg in a television interview on Friday.\n\nWith more people taking interest in bitcoin ETFs in light of the news, BNNBloomberg.ca spoke with Purpose Investments CIO Greg Taylor and Ninepoint Partners managing director Alex Tapscott to discuss what curious investors need to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWHAT IS A BITCOIN ETF?\n\nAn ETF is a way for investors to add exposure to an asset, such as gold or oil, without actually owning the product. These ETFs can be traded just like shares of a company.\n\n\u201cAn ETF is an exchange-traded fund, which is like a mutual fund, but it trades with a stock, meaning you can buy and sell at any point in time of the day,\u201d Tapscott said in the telephone interview.\n\n\u201cIt's a category that's grown very quickly for many investors who prefer the convenience and liquidity of being able to invest directly through an ETF.\u201d\n\nThe big difference between ETFs and the actual currency is that cryptocurrency requires a crypto wallet to exchange, while ETFs are available to anyone with a stock account and can be bought or sold at any time through the stock trading platforms.\n\n\u201cYou have to open an account with a crypto broker or deal with a crypto exchange, and then once you actually purchase your real crypto asset, you have to find a way to store it,\u201d Taylor said to explain the process of trading a cryptocurrency directly.\n\n\u201cThese are all different things which a lot of people just weren\u2019t comfortable doing and didn't really want to.\u201d\n\nWHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN CANADA?\n\nSpot-bitcoin ETFs have been available in Canada since 2021 and as a result, there are several options for Canadians to invest in.\n\nTapscott said there are about 20 different Canadian ETFs on the market, each with varying fees and levels of attractiveness. He pointed to Purpose Investments, CI and 3iQ as among the biggest companies with bitcoin ETFs on offer in Canada.\n\nCanadians can also access the new U.S.-based ETFs if their stock trading accounts have access to U.S.-based stocks.\n\nAdditionally, Canadians can buy ETFs in ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum ETFs are not yet approved in the U.S., but they have been approved in Canada and some of these products are available.\n\nTaylor\u2019s firm, Purpose Investments, current offers both ethereum and bitcoin ETFs, which are backed by the cryptocurrencies.\n\nHOW DOES THE U.S. REGULATORY CHANGE AFFECT CANADIAN INVESTORS?\n\nTapscott said the new U.S. regulations themselves don\u2019t affect Canadian investors, but they could pressure Canadian platforms to lower their fees in order to compete.\n\n\u201cIf you're an investor, then you have the option to buy something that's got better liquidity and lower fees, I think you're probably going to make the switch,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't happen overnight. A lot of people are in these funds, they've got a taxable gain they\u2019d rather not sell, but I think over time you're going to see money move away, or you're going to see the Canadian players forced to cut their fees to match what the U.S. providers are charging.\u201d\n\nSome Canadian players are already lowering fees to compete with their U.S. counterparts.\n\nFidelity Investments, which is among the 11 to receive U.S. approvals earlier this week, recently dropped the fees of its Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF account in Canada to 0.39 per cent.\n\nBecause Bitcoin ETFs trade like stocks, anyone with access to the New York Stock Exchange can invest in the U.S.-based ETFs.\n\nTaylor agreed that the U.S. market adds more competition in the space, but said he believes the Canadian products are best for Canadian investors.\n\n\u201cWe still think that the Canadian products are best in class and are always going to be offering investors exactly what they\u2019re designed to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe've had three years of trading basically at net asset value, so there's no premium or discount.\u201d\n\nWHAT SHOULD INVESTORS CONSIDER WITH BITCOIN ETFS?\n\nTapscott said investors need to understand that all crypto investments can be volatile, but that volatility can be a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething can go up a lot or down a lot in any period of time, so there's the potential for gains but also for losses,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that people need to appreciate that before diving in.\u201d\n\nTapscott added that he hopes people become educated in cryptocurrency before getting involved in the market, so they can make educated decisions about whether to invest.\n\nWHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS?\n\nVolatility remains the biggest risk when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, and both experts agreed that investors should be comfortable with the volatile nature of the assets before investing.\n\n\u201cIt's more volatile than other parts of the market so people need to be wary that this is not something you make into the core of your portfolio, it\u2019s something that you can use as a complement to your portfolio and maybe offer some diversification,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTapscott also cautioned that investors should be wary of potential compromises or hacks of the companies providing these assets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something an investor can control, that's up to the issuer, like BlackRock or Fidelity, to manage in a prudent way,\u201d he said, adding that while the possibility is remote, it\u2019s something investors \u201cmay want to keep in mind.\u201d"

        "content": "Crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently made a bullish prediction for the Ethereum price against Bitcoin in the near future, noting the path for this to happen. According to a social media post by the analyst, price action on the ETH/BTC pair for the next months will center around spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a rotation into ETH also in the prediction.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Prediction of 100% Ethereum Price Rise Against Bitcoin\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe recently took to X to share a chart of Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC pair) on the weekly timeframe. Price action on the chart forms green (bullish) candles during periods of Ethereum\u2019s performance over Bitcoin, while red (bearish) candles are formed during periods of Ethereum\u2019s underperformance against Bitcoin.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nXRP And XLM Price Correlation Persists, Ripple CTO Explains Why 8 months ago\n\nTaking a look at the chart shared by Van De Poppe shows that Ethereum\u2019s performance on the ETH/BTC pair has been on a decline since the middle of 2022. This decline particularly increased during the last quarter of 2023, as the enthusiasm regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs led to a surge in the price of Bitcoin. Consequently, the analyst noted that Ethereum\u2019s price performance against Bitcoin is now around the 2022 low of 0.04922.\n\nAccording to Van De Poppe, the approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to the creation of another liquidation candle on ETH/BTC to eventually take the liquidity around the 2022 low. This would eventually lead to a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair would be propelled to a target just above 0.12 by the rotation, signifying an increase of more than 100%. Notably, the last time ETH reached this level on the ETH/BTC pair was during the crypto\u2019s first major bull run in 2018.\n\n#Ethereum approaches the low of 2022 and is likely going to take the liquidity there. If an ETF approval for #Bitcoin happens, I think we\u2019ll have a liquidation candle on ETH/BTC and after that a rotation into Ethereum, combined with a bullish weekly divergence. pic.twitter.com/kGq91S7kq9 \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2024\n\nETH bulls regain control of price | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe Rotation Game Has Started\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved by the SEC on Wednesday, causing the price of Bitcoin to spike to $48,600, its highest point since April 2022. However, the price of Bitcoin has stalled and is now trading at $45,839, about where it was when the news of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs came out.\n\nAt the same time, Ethereum rose over $2,500 to reach $2,600, its highest point since April 2022. Ethereum has maintained this gain to outperform Bitcoin and is trading at $2,618 at the time of writing.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nIs Cardano The Next Solana?

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) continued its upward trajectory Wednesday, clocking a 10% gain in 24 hours to breach past the vaunted $2,600 mark. Market watchers attribute this surge to a confluence of factors, primarily fueled by anticipation of a forthcoming Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the wake of the expected approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nIn a historic move that cryptocurrency aficionados hope will bring more individual and institutional investors into the market, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds on Thursday.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Chaos Meets BONK Bliss: 15% Rally Bucks The Trend 8 months ago\n\nEthereum ETF Buzz Sparks Strategic Moves\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable trend towards frontrunning the ether ETF,\u201d noted Alex Onufriychuk, CEO of Kaminari, in a Telegram message. This sentiment aligns with the prevailing belief that Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, would be the next candidate for an ETF after Bitcoin.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, a prominent investor, dubbed a \u201cwhale\u201d in the crypto universe, made a strategic move by transferring 9,705 ETH (nearly $23 million) from Binance to Compound. This was followed by a 12 million Tether (USDT) loan, seemingly used to further accumulate ETH. The whale subsequently executed three profitable ETH transactions, netting roughly $5 million.\n\nThis decisive action signaled two things: confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future and the potential for profit-taking, which could introduce short-term volatility. Despite the risk, the whale\u2019s activity bolstered positive market sentiment.\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,607.8 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nFurther validating this optimism, Ethereum\u2019s network metrics experienced a surge. Both network growth and token velocity saw increases, indicating heightened interest from new addresses and more token movement. These on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for ETH\u2019s future.\n\nETH Futures Surge Amid ETF Optimism\n\nAlso adding to the bullish case, Open Interest for ETH futures contracts jumped 15% in recent days, reaching $4.57 billion at the time of writing. This signifies more traders entering the market and anticipating significant price gains following a potential ETF approval.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin Open Interest | Source: Velo Data\n\nAccording to reports, crypto traders expect Ethereum\u2019s price to rise after a favorable ETF judgment, even though Bitcoin is getting more attention in the media. If this situation plays out, the price of ETH could soon go beyond $2,600.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nIs Stacks The New Safe Haven? STX Soars 16% In Turbulent Market 8 months ago\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and unforeseen factors could still impact prices.\n\nThe timeline for an Ethereum ETF approval is uncertain, and regulatory hurdles could create delays. Additionally, broader market conditions and news on Ethereum development could also play a role.\n\nInvestors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, particularly in the dynamic and unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatured image from Medium"

        "title": "Kaspa (KAS) Token\u2019s Shark Investors Shifting Focus to Mollars ICO - NewsBTC",
        "content": "A new ICO promising to reshape the way investors see Bitcoin fees & Store-of-Value tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain is causing a stir in the crypto space.\n\nMollars, a digital currency designed to function as ERC-20\u2019s store of value, is seeing a parabolic jump in presale token activity. Investors are purchasing the token at record paces with the ICO selling over 133 tokens per second on Tuesday. Due to the parabolic uptrend, holders of prominent ERC-20 currencies in the crypto space, such as Ethereum, USDT, Shiba Inu, and Kaspa, are migrating towards this new project.\n\nAccording to Mollars presale wallet address, Kaspa investors have been buying the new token at the second fastest growing rate. This precedent has opened conversation in the $KASPA communities about the potential of the $MOLLARS token and how it can yield far greater ROIs than any of the memecoins on the market.\n\nUnderstanding Kaspa\n\nKaspa, a decentralized, open-source, and fully scalable Layer-1 solution, was a favorite among memecoin enthusiasts exiting Q4 of 2023. The project is cited as one of the most robust proof-of-work engines to appear in the market over the past three years. Rapid single-second block intervals and implementation of the GHOSTDAG protocol have made it a popular choice for investors seeking speed, scalability, and security in their crypto investments.\n\nThe GHOSTDAG protocol allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus, providing a secure operation while maintaining very high block rates.\n\nWhile Kaspa and Ethereum are separate blockchains, there is a connection between them through \u2014 wKAS. Despite it being an exclusive layer-1, a lot of the users are active on the ERC-20 as well.\n\nMollars Is a Solution To A Big Issue for Bitcoin Traders\n\nNonetheless, with all the technologies, Kaspa does not offer a solution to a major problem as Mollars does. This is why many investors are migrating thousands of dollars into the \u2018bitcoin killer\u2019 initial coin offering.\n\nBitcoin has the highest fees of all blockchains to date. Traders lost an average of $39 per transaction (buy or sell) last year in 2023 for engaging with the cryptocurrency. The reason people pay the fees however, the $BTC is a store-of-value token that is getting approved by the United States SEC for a spot ETF. Major investment agencies can dump billions of dollars into Bitcoin now.\n\nKaspa, on the other hand, will not have its blockchain nor native coin approved this way.\n\nSpot ETF Approval for Ethereum could be another catalyst for Mollars\n\nEther will be approved for the spot ETFs in May 2023 on the other hand. And Mollars is a store-of-value token on the Ethereum-blockchain, that should see direct benefits from the US SEC\u2019s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nNot only that, Mollars will be a functional store-of-value token on the world\u2019s best blockchain and have lower swap fees than Bitcoin. In layman\u2019s terms, the $MOLLARS token will have the traits of the $BTC but save traders a healthy percentage of their money.\n\nUnfortunately, Kaspa is far from advancing to this point of adoption and acceptance by the US government. The projection on ROI yield, acceptance, and transaction speed is far greater for Mollars.\n\nThere is a \u2018bridged\u2019 option for Kaspa to operate with Ether ($ETH) however. A significant portion of investors utilize \u2018Wrapped Kaspa\u2019 as a bridge facilitating seamless transactions between $KAS and $ETH. This bridge allows users to engage in Ethereum\u2019s vast DeFi ecosystem using their Kaspa holdings. However, with Ethereum soon getting its own spot ETF approval as Bitcoin just did, many traders believe it\u2019s better to just hold ETH or same-blockchain, ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAnd now, $KAS investors have a new token capable of storing their money on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nHow Mollars Is Capturing $KAS Sharks\n\nThe Mollars ($MOLLARS) project is designed to save costs from cross-chain transactions, attempting to get Bitcoin. The token could potentially reach 250 million users of the Ethereum Blockchain and save them big bucks on gas fees.\n\nTypically, investors tend to store their assets in Bitcoin due to the power the currency has as a store of value. However, this involves swapping between blockchains, which leads to costlier transactions.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin Ordinals boom of the last year, gas fees in the blockchain have reached record-high numbers. This development makes it less attractive to switch tokens to $BTC, and opens up a need for a reliable SoV on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nSpotting the need for a solution, one, developer initiated the \u201cMollars Save Dollars\u201d campaign, with the goal of introducing a novel token that fulfills all the requisites of an SoV (Store of Value) token directly within the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nWith a limited supply of 10 million tokens, Mollars presents a compelling case for investors seeking a deflationary asset. But what exactly makes Mollars stand out in the crowded crypto market?\n\nThe token\u2019s supply is remarkably constrained, surpassing even Bitcoin in scarcity. This characteristic positions $MOLLARS as a robust asset for long-term holding.\n\nScarcity inherently contributes to its increasing deflationary nature over time. Furthermore, mirroring $BTC, this project operates in an entirely ownerless fashion.\n\nThis setup ensures that holders exercise complete control and autonomy over their $MOLLARS, free from any centralized authority or ownership meddling in the token\u2019s governance or operations.\n\nWhy are Kaspa Investors Moving To Mollars?\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to this shift. First and foremost, the Mollars Initial Coin Offering (ICO) presents investors with a promising opportunity. The token is currently being sold for only $0.30, and those who buy now could potentially see a return on their investment exceeding 100% upon the currency\u2019s initial launch. This low entry point and the potential for high returns make Mollars an attractive proposition for investors.\n\nAlso, Mollars\u2019 role as a store of value provides a hedge against the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. For Kaspa investors, this means they could potentially use Mollars to protect their assets from market fluctuations while still participating in the potential upside of the crypto market.\n\nThis dual benefit of potential growth and risk mitigation is a key factor driving the shift towards Mollars.\n\nMollars Presale Explained\n\nThe Mollars token presale is an opportunity for early adopters to invest in the cryptocurrency at a lower price than its fair market value. The presale is structured into six rounds, with each round offering a specific number of $MOLLARS at a set price. The fundraising is 100% decentralized on Ethereum, and the claim will be manual.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the fundraising rounds:\n\nRound 1 (SOLD OUT): 250,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.30 each, for a total of $60,000.\n\nRound 2 (SOLD OUT): 300,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.40 each, for a total of $120,000.\n\nRound 3: 700,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.45 each, for a total of $315,000.\n\n700,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.45 each, for a total of $315,000. Round 4: 1,200,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.50 each, for a total of $600,000.\n\n1,200,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.50 each, for a total of $600,000. Round 5: 1,100,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.55 each, for a total of $605,000.\n\n1,100,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.55 each, for a total of $605,000. Round 6: 500,000 $MOLLARS available at $0.60 each, for a total of $300,000.\n\nOn listing date, the token will be listed at $0.62, providing a fast ROI yield for early presale adopters. However, the true growth of the project is expected to happen in the months following its presale. Given its extremely limited supply and its popularity as Ethereum\u2019s Store-of-Value (SoV), Mollars has prediction of goliath growth.\n\nThose looking to acquire the token at $0.45 are running out of time. As of today, the 3rd round of the presale is already 22% filled. Investors must act quickly in purchasing $Mollars as yesterday, the entire 2nd round of 300,000 tokens was fulfilled in under 24 hours.\n\nPotential 9,500,000% Growth\n\nMollars similarities to Bitcoin pave the way for the predictions that the currency could have a similar performance to the World\u2019s most famous crypto in regards to long-term ROI.\n\nAs the Mollars ICO draws to a close, investors are turning their attention to the token\u2019s potential growth post-ICO. Drawing parallels with the growth trajectory of BTC, the potential for the new ERC-20 token\u2019s growth in value is substantial.\n\nWildcard predictions shared on CoinMarketCap suggest a +9,500,000% ROI yield if Mollars follows a similar growth trajectory to Bitcoin, token for token. Given that its supply is even more limited than the world\u2019s largest currency, it lives in the most active blockchain, investors hope for a similar parabolic growth for the new Bitcoin challenger in the future."

How to Find an Ethereum Contract Address A block explorer is a web-based application enabling users to browse and search the Ethereum blockchain for various activities, including transactions, addresses, tokens, and current prices. Etherscan stands out as the most widely used block explorer for Ethereum. These platforms are useful for locating contract addresses, which can be done by searching for either the decentralized application (dApp) or the contract directly.\n\n\n\nMost Ethereum wallets compatible with ERC-20 tokens, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or MyEtherWallet, typically provide the contract addresses for the tokens they support. If you hold a particular token in your wallet, you\u2019ll often find its contract address displayed within the wallet\u2019s user interface. Numerous decentralized applications (dApps) and token projects list their contract addresses on their official websites. These addresses can typically be found in sections such as the FAQ, at the bottom of the homepage, or within the documentation area of the site. Individuals with technical expertise have the option of employing developer tools and Web3 platforms for a more direct method of locating and engaging with Ethereum contract addresses. Covalent, for instance, offers powerful APIs that facilitate the querying of blockchain data, which includes the discovery of contract addresses. Practical Uses of Ethereum Contract Addresses Prior to sending or receiving ERC-20 tokens, which are the standard format for tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain, it\u2019s crucial to confirm the token\u2019s authenticity by verifying its contract address. This step helps ensure that you are interacting with the genuine token and not a fake one. When engaging with decentralized applications (dApps), being aware of the contract address is essential for direct interaction with the smart contract. This knowledge is particularly useful for various activities, such as executing trades, engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or utilizing a decentralized exchange (DEX). For developers, the comprehension and utilization of contract addresses are fundamental aspects. Each time a new contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it generates a unique address. It\u2019s crucial for developers to record this address for any subsequent interactions with the contract. Key Considerations and Safety Tips Always double-check addresses : Given the irreversible nature of transactions on the blockchain, it\u2019s imperative to verify the accuracy of the contract address you\u2019re interacting with to avoid any irreversible errors.\n\n: Given the irreversible nature of transactions on the blockchain, it\u2019s imperative to verify the accuracy of the contract address you\u2019re interacting with to avoid any irreversible errors. Beware of scams : In the realm of cryptocurrency, phishing and scams are common threats. It\u2019s crucial to use contract addresses obtained only from reliable and trusted sources to ensure safety.\n\n: In the realm of cryptocurrency, phishing and scams are common threats. It\u2019s crucial to use contract addresses obtained only from reliable and trusted sources to ensure safety.
