        "content": "New data reveals that a deep-pocketed Ethereum (ETH) investor has woken up from a year of dormancy and is selling off its crypto assets as the top altcoin loses momentum.\n\nAccording to blockchain data tracker Lookonchain, the crypto whale has woken up from a 12-month slumber and is selling its stash of ETH over decentralized exchange platforms (DEX).\n\n\u201cA whale that has been dormant for one year is dumping ETH on DEX! So far, 18,865 ETH has been sold for four million DAI through four new wallets, the average selling price is $2,229. And currently has 5,588 ETH ($12.5 million) left.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,214 at time of writing, down about 6% from its 2023 high of $2,359.\n\nLookonchain then brings its attention toward the amount of decentralized oracle provider Chainlink (LINK) deposited into Binance, the top crypto exchange platform by volume. According to the data, noncirculating supply wallets deposited 8.3 million LINK, worth $119 million at time of writing, into Binance.\n\n\u201cThe wallets [have] deposited LINK to Binance every three months since Aug 26, 2022.\n\nInterestingly, most of the time, the deposit is at the bottom of the price and the price rises after that.\u201d\n\nChainlink is trading for $14.08 at time of writing.\n\nConcluding its analysis with Solana-based (SOL) memecoin Bonk (BONK), Lookonchain says that while one savvy trader lost $46,000 on November 1st, on December 15th, the same entity made a staggering $4.4 million from trading the dog-themed meme asset.\n\n\u201cThis trader owns two wallets. In the past year, the trader withdrew 334.5 billion BONK ($218,000) [from crypto exchange] MEXC and bought 32.18 billion BONK ($41,000) from DEX.\n\nAnd deposited 204.2 billion BONK ($80,000) to MEXC, leaving 172.5 billion BONK (worth $132,000 on Nov 1st). On Nov 1st, he still lost $46,000, but today he made $4.4 million.\u201d\n\nBONK is trading for $0.0000205 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "5 Cryptocurrency Predictions for 2024: Charting the Future of Digital Assets - Investing Haven",
        "content": "As we head into the 2024, several compelling trends emerge in crypto, shaping the future of digital assets. In this article, we look at 5 cryptocurrency predictions that could define the crypto space in 2024 and 2025. From our crypto charts, we derive 5 trends that will shape the future of digital assets, beyond our XRP forecast 2024 and $10 XRP forecast.\n\nIn recent years, we published our cryptocurrency forecast, each and every year right before year-end. If anything, it can be said that most, if not all, of our cryptocurrency predictions came true. Only our 2022 cryptocurrency predictions were somehow postponed, but eventually were achieved in 2023 or are close to be achieved in 2024.\n\nCrypto Prediction #1. Bitcoin\u2019s Ascension to All-Time Highs\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, along with Ethereum, is poised for a remarkable journey in 2024. We explained our viewpoint, in great detail, in the following articles, cryptocurrency predictions published a while ago but highly accurate based on the current path of Bitcoin:\n\nA Bitcoin Price Forecast For 2024\n\nHow High Can Bitcoin Go In 2024?\n\nWill Bitcoin go to $100,000 in 2024, 2025 or 2026?\n\nOur compass is the seven-year rising channel etched on its weekly chart, guiding us towards the anticipation of Bitcoin revisiting its previous all-time highs. As the market dynamics continue to evolve, Bitcoin\u2019s resilience remains a cornerstone, offering investors a reliable pathway in the crypto universe.\n\nCrypto Prediction #2. Game-Fi Resurgence\n\nIn the \u2018beaten down\u2019 area of blockchain gaming, Game-Fi is set to reclaim the spotlight. Axie Infinity, a trailblazer in the sector, serves as our North Star, pointing to a resurgence of interest and activity.\n\nThe vast majority of investors will look at the chart of Axie Infinity, with a lot of disinterest, and run for the hills because it\u2019s not hot. Over here, at InvestingHaven, we get unusually excited from Axie Infinity, simply because we see the bullish reversal that is clearly, visibly, certainly going to resolve to the upside. We believe that AXS will move to 40 USD, it will start in 2024 and might be complete late 2024 or in 2025. We stay focused on the future direction of this chart, not the current \u2018lack of momentum\u2019. In fact, we see momentum coming, it makes us unusually excited.\n\nAs blockchain gaming ecosystems mature, expect Game-Fi to captivate audiences anew, presenting exciting opportunities for both gamers and investors. For those that want to spot the best opportunities in Game-Fi, we recommend following our crypto investing research service because we will not feature the best Game-Fi tokens in the public domain.\n\nCrypto Prediction #3. Real-World Applications, Tokenization and NFTs in Focus\n\nThe crypto sphere is on the cusp of integrating with the tangible world. Real-life applications, whether in tokenizing physical assets or expanding the horizons of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are becoming a reality. 2024 could witness a transformative phase where blockchain technology steps out of the digital realm and makes a tangible impact on the real world.\n\nCrypto Prediction #4. Micro Caps\u2019 Meteoric Rise\n\nThe crypto market isn\u2019t just about the giants; hidden gems in the form of small and micro-cap coins are poised for a spectacular ascent. A multitude of charts reveals bullish reversals, quietly biding their time for the opportune moment to explode. Throughout 2024, keep an eye on these underdogs, as they have the potential to surge a hundredfold, rewriting the narrative of crypto investments.\n\nOne of the illustrations of what we are saying is the token shown below. We are, on purpose, not showing the symbol, simply to avoid a misunderstanding (some readers might take it as a \u2018buy recommendation\u2019 which it isn\u2019t). We use this chart as an illustration of the tremendous upside potential in some, not all, micro caps and nano caps.\n\nCase in point: the token shown below had a market cap of 1.5m in October, it went up 20x in a matter of 3 weeks, after which it retraced. We are 100% sure that many more micro caps and nano caps will follow the same path. Note that the token shown below has another 20x upside potential.\n\nCrypto Prediction #5. Meme Token Surprises, Beyond the Expected Names\n\nMeme tokens, often characterized by unpredictability, are set to surprise. However, the stars of this show might not be the familiar names. Buckle up for an unpredictable ride, as a select few meme tokens, hitherto under the radar, could undergo a staggering tenfold increase. In the crypto world, expect the unexpected.\n\nOur top meme pick was featured in our latest premium crypto alert, with very specific entry and exit areas, along with a strategy to multiple the tokens over a period of 2 years without doing anything. We recommend signing up to find out which meme token we are talking about, and read our strategy: Crypto \u2013 Time For Some Partial Exits And Free Tokens.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we step into 2024, the cryptocurrency space promises excitement, innovation, and unforeseen opportunities. While the future is inherently uncertain, these five predictions offer a glimpse into the potential trajectories that digital assets might traverse. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or a curious enthusiast, navigating the crypto landscape requires adaptability and a keen eye for emerging trends.\n\nSign up to get top token tips which we will not feature in the public space >>"

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nETH\u2019s Recent Gains and Positive Outlook: Ethereum\u2019s ETH has rebounded in 2023, reaching around $2,400, with some analysts forecasting a rise to $5,000 by 2025 due to a bullish trend.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ETH has rebounded in 2023, reaching around $2,400, with some analysts forecasting a rise to $5,000 by 2025 due to a bullish trend. High Expectations and Upgrades: Experts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800.\n\nExperts predict ETH could reach up to $8,000 by 2026, bolstered by upcoming Ethereum upgrades, with short-term predictions around $3,400-$3,800. Some Bearish Perspectives: Despite optimism, some, like trader Peter Brandt, are skeptical about Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects, questioning its functionality and future as a listed asset.\n\nCan Ethereum Be the Best Performer Next Year?\n\nThroughout 2023, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum \u2013 Ether (ETH) \u2013 managed to recover most of the losses incurred during the devastating 2022, reaching almost $2,400 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data) a few days ago. However, that valuation is still at the foothills of the all-time high of over $4,800 registered in November 2021.\n\nSome analysts believe the recent uptrend could continue next year, with ETH rising to a new peak in the following months. According to FieryTrading, the asset has been in a bullish mode for the past year and a half, suggesting a further surge in the near future:\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, ETH has been trading inside a bullish triangle pattern for over 1.5 years. In my eyes, a break out from this pattern might result in big gains for ETH since it will burst through an area full of short-trade stop-losses, which will be forced to buy back their positions.\u201d\n\nThe analyst predicted that Ether could jump to the coveted level of $5,000 by the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou \u2013 Managing Director at JPMorgan \u2013 also gave his two cents, highlighting Ethereum\u2019s upcoming \u201cProtodanksharding\u201d (EIP-4844) upgrade. He claimed it could help the ecosystem thrive and push ETH\u2019s price toward $8,000 by 2026, while Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nThe popular X (Twitter) user Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe is another person who forecasted success for ETH next year. In his view, the asset might correct to approximately $1,900 but remains poised to soar to $3,400-$3,800 by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOne Bearish Outlook\n\nIt is worth noting that some prominent figures are not so bullish on Ethereum. One example is the renowned trader Peter Brandt, who maintained that the token is \u201cnot comparable to BTC as a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke against the functionality of Ethereum and its gas prices, forecasting that it could \u201cnot even be a listed asset in 10 years.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Whale Resurfaces, Initiates Major Sell-Off - CoinGape",
        "content": "After a year of dormancy, a significant Ethereum whale has reemerged, creating ripples in the cryptocurrency market, with Lookonchain reporting this unexpected move. The whale, silent for over twelve months, initiated a substantial selling spree, offloading 18,865 ETH for a staggering 42 million DAI through four newly created wallets. This activity translates to an average selling price of $2,229 per ETH.\n\nThe market has been abuzz with speculation and analysis following this development. The revived whale\u2019s actions have led to the sale of a considerable amount of Ethereum, amounting to a current value of $12.5 million, with 5,588 ETH remaining in their possession. This event has caught the attention of both investors and analysts, given the significant amount of cryptocurrency involved and its potential impact on the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrasting Whale Behaviors\n\nThis selling trend by a dormant whale contrasts sharply with the behaviours observed in other segments of the Ethereum whale community. Crypto analyst Ali highlighted a contrasting scenario where several of the largest Ethereum whales have been actively accumulating ETH.\n\nETH/USD price chart\n\nOver the past week, these whales have reportedly added over 100,000 ETH, valued at approximately $230 million, to their holdings. This divergence in strategies underscores the varied approaches and sentiments prevalent among significant investors in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Current Market Position\n\nAmidst these developments, Ethereum\u2019s market performance remains a focal point. At the time of reporting, ETH experienced a slight upturn, with a 1.12% increase over the last 24 hours, bringing its value to $2,255.\n\nIntoTheBlock data suggests that Ethereum is trading in a crucial zone, with significant support and resistance levels identified. The $2,332 and $2,403 price points are key barriers in ETH\u2019s potential ascent towards the $3,000 mark, while support is around $2,127.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees continue to play a critical role in its market dynamics. The past week saw approximately 35,000 ETH burned, continuing a trend of negative net issuance that started in early November. These factors collectively contribute to the ever-changing landscape of Ethereum\u2019s market as investors and analysts closely watch these developments unfold.\n\nRead Also: XRP Ledger (XRPL) Hosts Phase 2 of Palau Stablecoin Project\n\nKelvin Munene Murithi Kelvin is a distinguished writer with expertise in crypto and finance, holding a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science.

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the largest and most used decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 layer-1 blockchain infrastructure. Its native token, ETH, is also the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with $270 billion at the time of publication.\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s price is up 85% in the last year, now trading at $2,249 per token. This surge has rewarded ETH holders, who are now 76% in profit, according to data by IntoTheBlock on December 16.\n\nIn particular, the percentage of Ethereum investors in profit is the same as long-term holders, who have kept their positions for over a year. Both data sets are achieved by looking at all active addresses in the network from the received and spent transactions.\n\nHowever, 23% of all Ethereum wallets are holding a losing ETH position, while 1% acquired the token at current prices. At the same time, 21% of Ethereum holders have held their position for between one and 12 months, while 3% just recently bought ETH.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders data. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIs it time to buy ETH with 76% of Ethereum holders in profit?\n\nIt is important to understand that the higher the number of Ethereum holders in profit, the higher the likelihood of a sell-off, as they might want to realize the, so far, unrealized profit. Therefore, buying ETH right now could mean becoming the profitable exit liquidity for 76% of all Ethereum holders.\n\nMeanwhile, only 46% of the tokens are concentrated in the hands of addresses holding at least 0.1% of its supply. The low concentration of whales and institutional investors lowers the risk of huge coordinated sell-offs. Balancing the previous analysis.\n\nCryptocurrency traders controversially believe we are experiencing either a bull rally in a bear market or a bull market already. Understanding the current status of cryptocurrencies is essential to make a profitable decision of buying or not buying ETH.\n\nMoreover, further developments and DeFi ecosystem growth for Ethereum could generate more demand for its token. An increased demand would drive ETH prices up, while a reduced demand would create an opposite outcome.\n\nAll things considered, the decision to buy ETH is personal, and investors must be aware of the risks. Essentially, having a good risk management start is necessary while investing in such a volatile and experimental market.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
