        "title": "What Does Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Mean in Crypto? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?\n\nProof-of-stake is a blockchain consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks. A consensus mechanism is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchain\u2014so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain.\n\nLearn more about proof-of-stake and how it is different from proof-of-work. Additionally, find out the issues proof-of-stake attempts to address within the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nKey Takeaways Under proof-of-stake (POS), validators are chosen based on the number of staked coins they have.\n\nProof-of-stake (POS) was created as an alternative to proof-of-work (POW), the original consensus mechanism used to validate transactions and open new blocks.\n\nWhile PoW mechanisms require miners to solve cryptographic puzzles, PoS mechanisms require validators to hold and stake tokens for the privilege of earning transaction fees.\n\nProof-of-stake (POS) is seen as less risky regarding the potential for an attack on the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous.\n\nThe next block writer on the blockchain is selected at random, with higher odds being assigned to nodes with larger stake positions.\n\nInvestopedia / Crea Taylor\n\nUnderstanding Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nProof-of-stake reduces the computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions. Under proof-of-work, hefty computing requirements kept the blockchain secure. Proof-of-stake changes the way blocks are verified using the machines of coin owners, so there doesn't need to be as much computational work done. The owners offer their coins as collateral\u2014called staking\u2014for the chance to validate blocks and earn rewards.\n\nValidators are selected randomly to confirm transactions and validate block information. This system randomizes who gets to collect fees rather than using a competitive rewards-based mechanism like proof-of-work.\n\nTo become a validator, a coin owner must \"stake\" a specific amount of coins. For instance, Ethereum requires 32 ETH to be staked before a user can operate a node. Blocks are validated by multiple validators, and when a specific number of validators verify that the block is accurate, it is finalized and closed.\n\nTo activate your own validator, you'll need to stake 32 ETH; however, you don't need to stake that much ETH to participate in validation. You can join validation pools using \"liquid staking\" which uses an ERC-20 token that represents your ETH.\n\nDifferent proof-of-stake mechanisms may use various methods to reach a consensus. For example, when Ethereum introduces sharding, a validator will verify the transactions and add them to a shard block, which requires no more than 128 validators to form a voting \"committee.\" Once shards are validated and a block created, two-thirds of the validators must agree that the transaction is valid, then the block is closed.\n\nHow Is Proof-of-Stake Different From Proof-of-Work?\n\nBoth consensus mechanisms help blockchains synchronize data, validate information, and process transactions. Each method has proven successful at maintaining a blockchain, although each has pros and cons. However, the two algorithms have very different approaches.\n\nUnder PoS, block creators are called validators. A validator checks transactions, verifies activity, votes on outcomes, and maintains records. Under PoW, block creators are called miners. Miners work to solve a hashing problem to verify transactions. In return for solving it, they are rewarded with a coin.\n\nTo \"buy into\" the position of becoming a block creator, you need to own enough coins or tokens to become a validator on a PoS blockchain. For PoW, miners must invest in processing equipment and incur hefty energy charges to power the machines attempting to solve the computations.\n\nThe equipment and energy costs under PoW mechanisms are expensive, limiting access to mining and strengthening the security of the blockchain. PoS blockchains reduce the amount of processing power needed to validate block information and transactions. The mechanism also lowers network congestion and removes the rewards-based incentive PoW blockchains have."

        "content": "It\u2019s too early to say, but we might look back at this moment when Ethereum establishes itself as the \u201cAmazon\u201d of the digital asset economy. If scenario unfolds (still a big \u201cif\u201d), it might relegate other smart contract layer 1s to niche players (like \u201cEtsys\u201d), even if still supporting thriving communities. It\u2019s unclear (to me at least), whether this is the best path for the industry; perhaps a more balanced multi-chain world would ultimately maximize adoption \u2013 we may never know. But at this stage, Ethereum dominance sure looks like the most likely outcome."

        "title": "Could Telegram-Associated TON Blockchain Be the 'Next Solana' and Challenge Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "While lagging behind Solana, TON\u2019s daily active addresses have exceeded Ethereum\u2019s figures every day except for one thus far in June. Some believe TON could close the distance in market cap with Solana.\n\nThe price of TON has increased nearly 392% to around $7.40 in the past year, making its market cap stand at $18 billion.\n\nThe Open Network (TON) Blockchain is showing signs it may be the next Solana by virtue of challenging the historical smart contract leader, Ethereum.\n\nDriven by Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet built into every app and the rampant play of mini-games, the TON blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in daily active addresses every day in June except one, a sign of growing popularity for the network connected to Telegram, the popular messaging application with more than 900 million monthly active users.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Artemis, TON has averaged 465,200 daily active addresses in June with a high of 568,300 on June 3, levels Ethereum has not crossed as the latter has yet to see more than 400,000 daily active addresses on its base layer in the month, excluding its various layer 2s.\n\n\u201cFor early ecosystems such as TON, we believe [daily active users] is a better metric to watch than [total value locked] or fees, as gathering users is a higher priority than making money,\u201d wrote Kelly Ye, portfolio manager at liquid venture firm Decentral Park Capital, in her weekly newsletter published on May 20.\n\nDespite having higher levels of daily active addresses than Ethereum, TON\u2019s growing figures still dwindle in comparison to Solana\u2019s which has averaged roughly 1.64 million daily active addresses in June.\n\n\u201cTON is good for the blockchain industry as data shows it\u2019s adding net new activity,\u201d wrote Andrew Van Aken, a data scientist at Artemis, in a Telegram message to Unchained. \u201cDaily active addresses on both Solana and TON have increased over the course of the year, indicating TON is onboarding new addresses.\u201d\n\nTON\u2019s Opt-Out Wallet Launches With Massive User Base\n\nTelegram\u2019s built-in community aided by its in-app crypto wallet has helped propel TON\u2019s level of daily active addresses to where it is currently, argued Jehan Chu, an investor in the TON ecosystem and managing partner of blockchain venture capital firm Kenetic.\n\nThe native crypto wallet in Telegram is \u201can opt-out wallet, which means other than the 30 or 40 million US users who are geoblocked, the other 860 million Telegram users all have a crypto wallet natively [and] automatically,\u201d Chu said in a conversation with Unchained. \u201cLet that sink in\u2026 That is Thanos-level kind of change.\u201d\n\nTelegram has been able to scale its technology as well as the onboarding of its large user base through the official rollout of Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet, launched in Sept. 2023. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s not really about wallets. It\u2019s about the seamless integration of web3 technology into where users already are,\u201d namely messaging, \u201cone of the highest traffic destinations for users on a daily basis,\u201d said Chu.\n\n\u201c99.999% of blockchain projects are a tech idea trying to create a community \u2013 from nothing. According to CoinMarketCap there are more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s a hard road for most,\u201d wrote Dan Morehead, CEO of crypto-focused venture firm Pantera, in the company\u2019s May announcement about how TON was its largest investment ever. \u201cTelegram is a community [of over 900 million users] integrating blockchain technology. That\u2019s just got to be easier.\u201d\n\nPantera, which has $4.7 billion in assets under management, cited other reasons in its rationale for investing in TON, including its values as a neutral platform independent of state influence and easy onboarding process.\n\nGames Drive Record Levels of Activity\n\nWhat has driven the recent surge in activity is another factor that led Pantera to its massive investment: an ecosystem of mini-applications which include chatbots and games. Referring to Telegram\u2019s increased levels of daily active addresses, Chu said it arose from \u201ca combination of things \u2013 obviously, games are a big driver.\u201d A number of mini-games within Telegram have attracted substantial attention from its users, such as Notcoin, Hamster Kombat, and Catizen.\n\nNotcoin, a free game on Telegram where over 35 million users have tapped their screens to earn tokens, rolled out its cryptocurrency in May and has since garnered a market cap of $1.6 billion, data from CoinGecko shows. Similarly, Hamster Kombat has nearly 33.6 million subscribers in its Telegram channel, while Catizen has over 3.6 million users.\n\nBloomberg also reported on Tuesday that many in the crypto space believe this trend of mini-games in Telegram \u201ccould be the \u2018killer app\u2019 that will define the current bull market.\u201d\n\nWhile they don\u2019t interact with the TON blockchain, popular trading bots such as BONKbot native to Solana and Banana Gun, which is on Ethereum, depend on Telegram to generate fees from enabling crypto users to trade on their mobile devices. Telegram also has trading bots for the TON blockchain, such as sTONks and TOB Bot.\n\n\u201cWe believe that similar TON-native Telegram bots will become the preferred user experience for many traders,\u201d according to Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera.\n\nThe price of TON has increased nearly 392% to around $7.40 in the past year, bringing its market cap to $18 billion. Despite outpacing the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, BTC and ETH, TON\u2019s price performance this last year is not as strong as Solana\u2019s, whose native token soared 860% in the same period to a market cap of more than $68 billion.\n\nAccording to Decentral Park Capital\u2019s Ye, TON has solid potential \u201cto close the gap in market cap with Solana this cycle.\u201d\n\nCorrection (June 13, 2024 11:14 A.M. EST): The previous title erroneously referred to TON Blockchain as belonging to Telegram. Following the SEC\u2019s ruling, Telegram has no relationship with The Open Network (TON) Blockchain, which is now stewarded by the TON Foundation. Unchained regrets the mistake."

        "content": "If the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds represented a watershed moment for cryptocurrency, the arrival of spot Ether ETFs on Wall Street could be nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nIn a move that caught even the most bullish crypto cheerleaders off guard, U.S. regulators have cleared the way for ETFs for the world's most popular altcoin, Ether (ETH), the native crypto of the Ethereum decentralized blockchain platform.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC on June 5 that spot Ether ETF approvals will take some time, a nuance misunderstood by many investors who believed they would be able to buy and sell spot Ether ETFs in a matter of weeks.\n\nDespite a long-standing belief that the SEC holds a more skeptical stance over crypto, on May 23 the regulator approved 19b-4 filings for eight spot Ether ETFs, including Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF on NYSE Arca; iShares Ethereum Trust on Nasdaq; and VanEck Ethereum Trust, 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund and Franklin Ethereum ETF on CBOE BZX. In early June, NYSE Arca also proposed a rule change to allow the listing of ProShares Ethereum ETF. None of these ETFs are available to trade yet, as the SEC still must give the nod to the funds' S-1 registration filings.\n\nSponsored Crypto Exchanges 1 Gemini Account Minimum $0 Fee 0.2% Maker Fee / 0.4% Taker Fee Gemini is well-suited for crypto traders of any skill level and available in all 50 states.

Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nAlthough spot Ether ETFs are unlikely to emulate spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in terms of inflows upon launch, the weight of the SEC's decision to approve one of the most functional projects in the crypto ecosystem is apparent. Though there are ETFs that offer managed exposure to Ether futures contracts, direct exposure to Ether will be new.\n\nWhile Bitcoin's status as the world's first and oldest cryptocurrency has helped to cement its popularity, more than 10,000 projects have been developed on Ethereum's blockchain, and the approval of Ether ETFs can help to generate far more mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency and the many crypto-centric innovations it's helped to grow.\n\nWith this in mind, let's take a deeper look at the contrasts between spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ether ETFs and why they shouldn't be seen as two sides of the same coin.\n\nSpot Ether ETF vs. Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThere are several important differences between spot Bitcoin ETFs and the spot Ether ETFs investors expect to be formally greenlit in the coming months.\n\nFirst, in terms of assets under management, Bitcoin ETFs are set to far outweigh those of Ether ETFs. As of June 12, the AUM for spot Bitcoin ETFs totaled $59.4 billion, representing an increase of more than double that of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's $28.7 billion in AUM at the beginning of trading in January.\n\nBy contrast, Grayscale Ethereum Trust's AUM at the end of May were $11 billion. It's also unlikely that spot Ether ETFs will be inundated with the same opening-day inflow of $655.2 million that Bitcoin ETFs experienced.\n\nThis is because Ethereum is a more complex entity than Bitcoin, and is more difficult to value for investors. While Bitcoin's older blockchain framework isn't optimized for functionality in the same way as its younger counterparts, Ethereum is an example of how cryptocurrency can represent far more than a simple store of value.\n\nFor starters, Ether offers annual yield through staking, although this feature won't be available for ETF holders. Furthermore, Ethereum's blockchain has become a highly functional ecosystem for hosting decentralized finance, or DeFi, projects that can focus on peer-to-peer lending and offer advanced blockchain-based open finance services.\n\nEthereum's blockchain has also become a popular framework for the burgeoning non-fungible token landscape, and many NFTs today are bought and sold using Ether.\n\nBoth cryptocurrencies are fundamentally different on a technical level, too. Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) mining mechanism and a capped total supply of 21 million coins to impose a significant level of scarcity that has drawn comparisons to digital gold. Ether has no such circulation cap, and its proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism for minting new coins requires far less computational power and can mint far more Ether.\n\nAs a result, Ether's market capitalization of $419 billion is far lower than Bitcoin's $1.3 trillion (as of June 13), but the more technical capabilities of Ethereum's blockchain have the potential to draw investor interest as it hosts more innovative DeFi projects that could drive digital transformation throughout the financial sector and beyond.\n\nThe New Spot Ether ETFs Explained\n\nAn SEC memorandum laid out the authorization for NYSE Arca, Nasdaq and CBOE BZX to list spot Ether ETFs. The new arrivals include:\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust\n\nGrayscale Investments filed to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ticker: ETH), one of the first securities solely focused on Ether, to a spot-price ETF. Despite Grayscale withdrawing its application for the Grayscale Ethereum Futures Trust ETF on May 3, the SEC's approval for NYSE Arca to list the Ethereum Trust signifies the institution's foray deeper into the world of crypto, following its Bitcoin Trust ETF, which was until recently Wall Street's largest crypto ETF with $19.1 billion in assets under management. The largest is now iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $20.6 billion in AUM as of June 12.\n\nBitwise Ethereum ETF\n\nBitwise Asset Management is a crypto-focused pioneer that already made waves with the launch of its Bitcoin ETF. The institution has built a reputation for supporting next-generation technology, and its launch of a Web3 ETF in late 2022 underlines its commitment to exciting new innovations.\n\nEthereum already has some exposure throughout Bitwise's suite of services, like the firm's 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW), which has offered investors returns of more than 50% for the first half of 2024 alone. Its Ethereum ETF is set to be listed on NYSE Arca.\n\niShares Ethereum Trust\n\nAfter becoming the world's largest cryptocurrency ETF provider with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in recent weeks, forward-thinking BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is expected to become a market leader when its spot Ethereum ETF launches on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe firm already made amendments to its iShares Ethereum Trust on May 29 ahead of its pending launch, and the spot ETF is likely to be hard to beat for investors.\n\nVanEck Ethereum Trust\n\nThe VanEck Ethereum Trust ETF has been a leader in this field since news of VanEck's intentions broke in September 2023. VanEck has built a reputation for offering access to untapped markets, and its decision to focus on Ether ETFs is a major step toward more Wall Street acceptance of cryptocurrency.\n\nInvesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF\n\nFollowing the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), the Ethereum iteration will champion the same partnership between global ETF provider Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) and Web3 leader Galaxy Asset Management. The team will use its experience with direct exposure to digital assets to inform the fund's strategy.\n\n21Shares Core Ethereum ETF\n\nThis ETF's initial application was initially sought by two companies, 21Shares and Ark. However, the two companies have decided to end their partnership, and 21Shares has filed an updated application, rebranding from Ark 21Shares Ethereum ETF to 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.\n\nFidelity Ethereum Fund\n\nApproved to list on CBOE BZX, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund seeks to build on the success of Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), a spot BTC ETF with $11.9 billion in AUM.\n\nFranklin Ethereum ETF\n\nAnother CBOE BZX listing is the Franklin Ethereum ETF. As one of the first ETFs to announce its associated fees, Franklin has set a competitive annualized rate of 0.19% of net asset value. Because of its relatively low cost, many analysts have suggested that the firm has sought to spark a fee war by playing its cards early.\n\nLeveraged, Inverse ProShares Ether ETFs Hit the Market\n\nOn June 7, ProShares launched two funds \u2013 a 2x leveraged and 2x inverse ETF \u2013 tied to the Bloomberg Ethereum Index and listed on NYSE Arca. The leveraged ETF, ProShares Ultra Ether ETF (ETHT), targets a double return of whatever the index does during the day, whereas the inverse ETF, ProShares UltraShort Ether ETF (ETHD), provides the opposite of that. ProShares also makes leveraged and inverse exposure to Ether futures available through two other ETFs, and it offers ETF exposure to a combination of Bitcoin and Ether futures as well, according to VettaFi.\n\nHow Will Spot Ether ETFs Impact Crypto Prices?\n\nBecause Ethereum's blockchain hosts more than 10,000 crypto projects, the SEC's approval of a spot Ether ETF will have a major impact on the many altcoins that make up the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nWith Bitcoin's crypto market share at about 54%, the arrival of a spot Bitcoin ETF carried a significant impact on the ecosystem at scale. The arrival of the spot Ether ETF, however, is likely to have a more profound effect on the remaining 46% of assets that make up the rest of the market.\n\nAcceptance helps deliver more regulatory clarity to the Ethereum blockchain, which in turn drives competition and encourages innovation. This paves the way for more small-cap projects to emerge and generates market momentum, making altcoins more visible to Wall Street and the financial sector, and ultimately supporting higher crypto prices.\n\n\n\nCould Spot Ether ETFs Offer a Boost to Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThe arrival of spot Ether ETFs is unlikely to have a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin. BTC itself is expected to drive the crypto market higher as a result of its anticipated post-halving event rally, which tends to deliver a bull market every four years.\n\nThat's not to say that Ether ETFs won't help Bitcoin ETFs grow, as crypto ETFs are adopted into the mainstream. Approval of the more technical Ethereum could also help institutions and individual investors understand cryptocurrencies better.\n\nWhy Was Staking Left Out of Updated Filings?\n\nOne major omission from spot Ether ETF filings was the cryptocurrency's staking framework. This comes after plenty of uncertainty over whether Ether is a security or commodity.\n\nEthereum staking works when investors can earn interest by locking up Ether on its blockchain for a predetermined period. This, according to the SEC, would classify staking-as-a-service as the offering of an unregistered security and has previously led to the commission taking out lawsuits against exchanges like Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) and Kraken for allowing its users to stake their own coins.\n\nGrayscale and other ETF applicants were hopeful that they could add staking features to their ETFs, but they ultimately removed this aspect of their proposals when it became a sticking point for the SEC.\n\nThis core feature of Ethereum has been a popular way for users to build a passive income, however, and investors could be less enthusiastic about embracing spot Ether ETFs without staking.\n\nBuilding on a Landmark Year for Crypto\n\nBecause of Ethereum's greater functionality and more intrinsic link to cryptocurrencies as a whole, the final approval of spot Ether ETFs by the SEC, expected this summer, has the potential to eclipse that of January's spot Bitcoin ETF approval in terms of wider crypto acceptance on Wall Street."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Approval: SEC\u2019s 2nd Massive Delay Disrupts Market - TronWeekly",
        "content": "Issuers of prospective spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are still in limbo, waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide feedback on their S-1 filings. According to two sources, these drafts were initially submitted on May 31, with the issuers anticipating comments from the SEC by June 7. Yet, at least two issuers have reported receiving no feedback as of now. One source mentioned that they now expect the SEC\u2019s comments to arrive later this week.\n\nThis delay follows a statement by SEC Chair Gary Gensler on CNBC, where he indicated that the approval process for the S-1 forms would \u201ctake some time.\u201d The uncertainty over the timeline remains, with one source previously suggesting that the S-1 forms might need at least two more rounds of draft filings before being ready for final approval.\n\nEthereum ETF Launching Process\n\nThe path to launching these spot Ethereum ETFs involves a two-step process. The initial step was the approval of the 19b-4 forms, which was completed on May 23. The current focus is on the S-1 filings, which, once approved, will pave the way for the ETFs to start trading.\n\nThe draft filings have revealed some intriguing details about the upcoming products. Notably, BlackRock is seeding its ETF with $10 million, indicating strong initial capital backing. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton has outlined a competitive fee structure, planning to charge a 0.19% fee.\n\nAs the market eagerly awaits the launch of these spot Ethereum ETFs, a significant question lingers: Can they replicate the success of the spot Bitcoin ETFs? Bitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, Jag Kooner, offers a tempered outlook, estimating that the Ethereum ETFs will attract around 10-20% of the inflows that have been directed towards their Bitcoin counterparts.\n\nThe potential launch of these Ethereum ETFs marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market, offering investors a new avenue to gain exposure to Ethereum. However, the timeline remains uncertain as issuers and investors alike wait for the SEC\u2019s next move. The ongoing wait underscores the regulatory complexities involved in bringing innovative financial products to market, reflecting the cautious approach of the SEC in navigating the evolving landscape of digital assets."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a significant development on the crypto market, crypto exchange Coinbase has witnessed the largest Ethereum (ETH) outflow of the year, amounting to over $1 billion. This massive movement, reported by CryptoQuant, has sparked discussions and speculations about its potential implications for ETH and the broader market.\n\nCryptoQuant's data reveals that more than 336,000 ETH were withdrawn from the trading platform, totaling an approximate value of $1.17 billion on June 12, 2024. This event marks the fifth instance in 2024 where withdrawals from Coinbase have exceeded 150,000 ETH. The range of these transactions has varied from $400 million to $1.1 billion, indicating the involvement of substantial market participants.\n\nWho's behind withdrawals?\n\nThe scale and frequency of these withdrawals suggest that they are not driven by individual Ethereum traders . Instead, the transactions are likely the actions of whales or unknown institutional players. This assumption aligns with the observation that such large-scale movements are typically beyond the capacity of retail traders and are more characteristic of significant entities with major holdings and strategic market positions.\n\nThe exact reasons behind this enormous withdrawal remain speculative. However, historical patterns and market behaviors provide some insights. Similar large-scale withdrawals were observed on Coinbase for Bitcoin (BTC) before the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year. This has led to speculation that the current ETH outflow might be driven by anticipation of potential Ethereum spot ETFs in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPositive indicators for long term\n\nIf these withdrawals are not merely internal movements by the exchange, they could signal a positive indicator for Ethereum's long-term prospects. Reducing the circulating supply of ETH, particularly in such large quantities, can create scarcity, leading to upward pressure on its price. This supply-demand dynamic is a fundamental principle on asset markets and is especially pertinent on a volatile and sentiment-driven crypto market."

        "content": "SEC chair Gary Gensler said the spot Ethereum ETFs will be approved in the course of the summer.\n\nThe SEC has already greenlit a crucial batch of documents.\n\nOdds of the ETFs launching on July 4 have plummeted on Polymarket.\n\nSpot Ethereum exchange-traded funds are likely to launch this summer.\n\nThat\u2019s what Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler told US senators today during a hearing on the agency\u2019s funding request for 2025.\n\n\u201cI would envision sometime over the course of this summer,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nThe SEC has already greenlit a batch of documents necessary for the launch of Ethereum ETFs, called 19b-4s, but still needs to get a second set of filings, called S-1s, finalised with prospective ETF issuers.\n\nIt\u2019s only once both sets of documents are completed that the SEC can officially approve the ETFs \u2014 and subsequently launch the products.\n\n\u201cIndividual issuers still are working through the registration process,\u201d Gensler said. \u201cThat\u2019s working smoothly.\u201d\n\nEther didn\u2019t react to the news. The second largest cryptocurrency by value is down 4.4% in the last 24 hours, and trading for $3,450.\n\nMarket expectations\n\nOn betting platform Polymarket, odds that the ETFs will begin trading on July 4 have shot down 15% in the wake of Gensler\u2019s comments.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBettors now believe there\u2019s a 29% chance the products will launch on Independence Day.\n\nAnd two weeks ago Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that there was a \u201clegit possibility\u201d the ETFs could launch by the end of June, though he ascribed more chances to July 4.\n\nApproval process\n\nThe Ethereum ETF approval process has differed markedly from the Bitcoin ETF approval process.\n\nThe SEC started communicating early on with prospective Bitcoin ETF issuers to get both 19b-4 filings and S-1 filings finalised at the same time. The agency then officially approved the funds on January 10, and they launched the next day.\n\nIn the Ethereum ETF\u2019s case, however, prospective issuers only got radio silence from the SEC as a crucial May 23 deadline for 19b-4s loomed closer, leading analysts to believe the ETFs would get rejected.\n\nHowever, on May 20 the SEC began frantically communicating with ETF issuers to get their 19b-4 filings in order before the deadline hit.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s shift was likely politically motivated, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told CNBC at the time.\n\nBut because the agency\u2019s change of heart was so unexpected, its division of Corporate Finance, which takes care of S-1 filings for prospective ETFs, was likely caught off guard. So the S-1 process, which took four months for the Bitcoin ETFs, may have only started three weeks ago.\n\nThe paperwork isn\u2019t expected to take as long for Ethereum ETFs, however, since a lot of the kinks for offering spot crypto ETFs were already worked out when the SEC tackled the Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nNine different ETFs \u2014 issued by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Grayscale Investments, VanEck, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, ARK Invest and 21 Shares, Hashdex, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise \u2014 will likely launch.\n\nTom Carreras and Jo Wright write about markets and regulation for DL News.

Discover SCENE\n\nThe S-1 registration forms for several spot Ethereum ETF applicants will likely be approved this summer, according to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler.\n\nThis comes after the agency approved 19b-4 applications from stock exchanges in late May to list such products. All that\u2019s needed now is the regulatory nod on the applications from individual issuers, after which a spot Ethereum ETF can immediately go live in the United States.\n\n\u201cIndividual issuers are still working through the registration process. That\u2019s working smoothly,\u201d Gensler said during a Senate hearing on Thursday. \u201cI would envision that some time over the course of this summer they\u2019ll be [approved].\u201d\n\nGensler highlighted how Ethereum futures ETFs had already gone live last summer, and that CME Ether futures had already existed for years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile there proved to be very little demand for those futures ETFs, many analysts\u2014including K33 Research\u2014expect the spot products to absorb up to $4 billion in their first five months, representing 20% to 30% of the flows to their Bitcoin-based counterparts.\n\nThe chairman\u2019s projected timeline reflects that of ETF experts at Bloomberg, who said it would likely take \u201cweeks\u201d to \u201cmonths\u201d before the S-1 documents were greenlit following the 19b-4 approvals. Either way, the arrival of such funds in the U.S. was a matter of \u201cif\u201d not \u201cwhen.\u201d\n\nDespite his confirmation, Gensler still didn\u2019t directly answer whether Ethereum classifies as a security or commodity when directly asked. Legal experts argue that Ethereum has implicitly been ruled a commodity already by being approved as a single-asset ETF product.\n\nThe chairman also expressed concern over a stipulation recently included in the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2025 funding bill by the House Appropriations Committee. The stipulation requires that \u201cnone of the funds made available\u2026 may be used to carry out an enforcement action related to a digital asset transaction,\u201d unless related to fraud or market manipulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would seriously undercut our efforts,\u201d said Gensler. \u201cWhile not all cryptos are crypto securities\u2026 those that are have an obligation to disclose to the public full, fair, and complete information.

Apart from this, TON led the altcoin pack with a remarkable surge of 110% growth in non-empty wallets over the past six months. Bitcoin may have the most non-empty wallets, but the altcoin\u2019s growth is the fastest in this category. This surge in wallet activity positions TON as a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market, showcasing increasing interest and engagement from investors and users alike.\n\nWith a net change of 16.8K wallets, the token has seen exponential growth in its user base, indicating growing confidence in the project and its underlying technology. This surge comes amidst a broader trend of heightened interest in cryptocurrencies, fueled by increased institutional adoption, growing mainstream acceptance, and evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nTON\u2019s Silent Surge\n\nHowever, the latest surge can be due to several factors. Firstly, the integration with Telegram provides an enormous built-in user base, which facilitates easier adoption and use of TON\u2019s services. Secondly, the simplicity and efficiency of TON\u2019s blockchain, designed to handle high transaction volumes with low fees, appeal to users looking for an alternative to Ethereum\u2019s often congested and expensive network.\n\nWith Telegram\u2019s backing, the token has a unique advantage in terms of user reach and engagement. If the network can capitalize on this foundation and continue to grow its ecosystem, it could emerge as a formidable player in the crypto space. In conclusion, while TON\u2019s quiet rise might have been overlooked by many, the underlying trends suggest a significant shift in the crypto landscape."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Cooling Off\u2014But Gaming Token Prices Are Down Bad - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the price of leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin cools off, gaming tokens are among the worst-hit tokens over the last week, with one major game\u2019s token dropping 40% during the span.\n\nAfter a broadly strong first half of the year for crypto, Bitcoin has dipped by nearly 6% over the past week to $66,830, while Ethereum has fallen a larger 10% to $3,460 as investors wait for spot Ethereum ETFs to start trading in the U.S.\n\nBut while the crypto market bleeds, the gaming segment has suffered some of the worst casualties. Gaming tokens tend to be highly volatile, like meme coins, due in part to the crypto gaming market still being relatively nascent. And this week, top tokens tied to gaming projects are taking some of the biggest hits of all.\n\nWorst affected among major gaming tokens is Guild of Guardians (GOG), tumbling 40% to $0.105, with Parallel\u2019s PRIME token falling closely behind with a 36% drop to just under $11.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGuild of Guardians launched on Ethereum scaling network Immutable zkEVM in May, earning a positive review from Decrypt\u2019s GG after signing up over 1 million prospective players ahead of the wider release. But as the game plans to roll out a new Guardian, it couldn\u2019t withhold market pressure with its token dropping.\n\nPRIME\u2019s dip comes amid Parallel\u2019s launch onto the Epic Games Store, a move that puts the NFT card-battling game in front of a monthly audience of 75 million active users. Once again, despite this apparently positive move for the game, it was still one of the worst-hit gaming tokens this week.\n\nOther top losers include the layer-3 Ethereum gaming network Xai (XAI), which is down 30% to about $0.63 amid the launch of its Vanguard: Genesis campaign. This initiative will see several new games rolled out on the network in the coming months, on top of fresh rewards up for grabs for players and builders alike.\n\nAfter a successful airdrop campaign earlier this year, Portal (PORTAL) has fallen 30% this week, while Clash of Clans-style mobile game Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA) fell 29%. Prominent Telegram-based clicker game Notcoin (NOT) has tumbled 19% not long after hitting 40 million players.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the gaming tokens in the top 100 overall cryptocurrencies by market cap have seen similarly large drops, including Gala Games (GALA) at a 25% drop, Beam (BEAM) down 20%, and Immutable (IMX) falling nearly 19% over the past seven days.\n\nIn fact, the gaming market has been hit so badly that only six out of the top 100 GameFi tokens, as categorized by CoinGecko, are in the green over the past week. Most notably, real-time strategy game Apeiron (APRS) is up 5% while its esports championship rages on.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

In a recent announcement, the company revealed that the stablecoin, named Ripple USD (RLUSD), is set to launch on the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum blockchain later this year.\n\nIntroducing Ripple USD (RLUSD): A 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin, offering transparency and stability on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Coming later this year. Sign up to receive the latest stablecoin news, content and availability: https://t.co/ifguG77bO6 \u2014 Ripple (@Ripple) June 12, 2024\n\nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also described RLUSD as \u201cReal USD.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name of the Ripple stablecoin [is] RLUSD; I like to call it Real USD or Ripple USD,\u201d said Garlinghouse at the XRP Ledger Apex 2024 this week.\n\nPegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, RLUSD will be fully backed by a combination of USD, short-term US Government bonds, and cash equivalent assets, as previously reported by Crypto Briefing.\n\nWith the new product, Ripple aims to diversify its stablecoin offerings. In addition, the company expects to enhance support for DeFi applications, including AMM exchanges, by providing a reliable asset solution.\n\nThe announcement follows Ripple\u2019s recent acquisition of Standard Custody and the appointment of its CEO, Jack McDonald, as Senior Vice President overseeing the stablecoin division yesterday.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple has chosen Axelar\u2019s interoperability platform for its XRPL EVM sidechain, favoring its user-friendly approach over the previously considered XLS-38 bridge. The company said Axelar\u2019s integration with prominent projects and its security features were key factors in this decision.\n\n3/ We're migrating to @axelarnetwork for its robust security and efficiency in cross-chain transactions. \"Axelar is a battle-tested, production-ready bridge to bring XRP as a native currency to the XRPL EVM Sidechain.\u201d \u2014 @FerranPrat12, @Peersyst CEO. \u2014 RippleX (@RippleXDev) June 12, 2024\n\nDespite recent progress, RLUSD has faced regulatory roadblocks. In a legal document filed in May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims that Ripple\u2019s proposed stablecoin is an unregistered crypto asset. According to the SEC, the stablecoin is evidence that Ripple might keep doing things that violate securities laws."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY , June 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, with Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining their positions as the leading digital assets. These two giants have set the benchmark for innovation, adoption, and market performance. However, a new contender, Furrever Token, is making waves with its unique appeal and innovative referral bonus system. This guide explores how Furrever Token could potentially join the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum and what makes it a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nBitcoin: The Pioneer of Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin (BTC) remains the most well-known and valuable cryptocurrency. Launched in 2009 by an anonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of decentralized digital currency. Over the years, Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations, but it has consistently maintained its position as the market leader. Recently, Bitcoin faced a dip in its price following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged, currently trading around $42,590. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin's long-term potential and widespread adoption continue to attract investors.\n\nEthereum: The King of Smart Contracts\n\nEthereum (ETH), launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, has revolutionized the crypto space with its smart contract functionality. Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain, making it the backbone of numerous blockchain projects. Ethereum\u2019s price has shown resilience, currently on a bullish trend with predictions of reaching significant price targets in the near future. The network\u2019s continuous upgrades and its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) reinforce its strong market position.\n\nEnter Furrever Token: The New Contender\n\nAmidst the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, Furrever Token (FURR) is emerging as a promising new player in the crypto market. Designed to bring a whimsical and heartwarming touch to the digital currency space, Furrever Token features adorable cat-themed imagery and a strong focus on community engagement.\n\nInnovative Referral Bonus System\n\nOne of the standout features of Furrever Token is its innovative referral bonus system. This system allows users to earn 10% in FURR tokens for every deposit made through their personal referral links. This not only incentivizes early adoption but also fosters strong community growth. The referral system is a unique strategy that leverages the power of community engagement to drive the token\u2019s growth and adoption.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Financial Potential\n\nFurrever Token offers substantial financial potential, promising up to 15X returns for early investors. Currently priced at just $0.000732, Furrever Token is in Stage 9 of its presale, having already raised over $1.3 million, with a target of $1.9 million before its launch on PancakeSwap. This attractive entry point, combined with its innovative features, positions Furrever Token as a noteworthy investment opportunity.\n\nSecurity and Compliance\n\nSecurity and compliance are top priorities for Furrever Token. The project has undergone rigorous audits by Securi Lab to ensure a safe and reliable investment environment. Additionally, the team has committed to locking their tokens for one year, providing reassurance to the community about the project\u2019s longevity and stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Furrever Token Join the Ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the market with their established presence and robust infrastructures, Furrever Token presents a fresh and unique opportunity. Its innovative referral bonus system, strong financial potential, and focus on community engagement set it apart from many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs the crypto market evolves, the potential for new players like Furrever Token to join the ranks of established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum grows. Investors looking for new opportunities in the meme coin space should consider the promising prospects of Furrever Token.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have solidified their positions as the top cryptocurrencies, but the market is always open to innovative new players. Furrever Token, with its unique appeal and innovative referral system, is well-positioned to capture the attention of investors and potentially join the ranks of these market leaders.

        "content": "MetaMask users can now stake small amounts of Ether through the wallet.\n\nThe new offering charges higher fees than market leader Lido.\n\nMetaMask is going all in on the $116 billion market in Ethereum staking.\n\nConsensys, the firm behind the top crypto wallet, announced Wednesday the launch of Pooled Staking, a new offering that will let those with small amounts of Ether pool their tokens and earn staking rewards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple way to be rewarded for contributing to the security of Ethereum,\u201d Matthieu Saint Olive, a senior product manager at Consensys, told DL News. \u201cThis solution will be competitive.\u201d\n\nPreviously, only users with 32 Ether could stake through MetaMask.\n\nThe Pooled Staking launch puts MetaMask on an equal footing with other staking providers that accept small amounts of Ether for staking.\n\nBut it could be an uphill battle for MetaMask to break into this highly-competitive market.\n\nSaint Olive said MetaMask will charge Pooled Staking users 15% of their staking rewards for its service \u2014 much higher than leading Ethereum staking provider Lido\u2019s 10%.\n\nThe market for Ethereum staking is huge. Almost 33 million Ether tokens worth $116 billion are staked on the blockchain, earning at least 3.1% per year, paid in Ether.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nLido dominates the market, accounting for almost 29% of all Ether staked.\n\nLido dominates the Ethereum staking market. (Dune Analytics/@hildobby)\n\nBy providing a more accessible option to MetaMask users, Consensys is hoping its Pooled Staking feature can compete against dozens of other options, many of which, like Lido, offer lower fees.\n\nStaking fees\n\nStaking on Ethereum is complex.\n\nIt requires in-depth technical knowledge, a stable internet connection, and a minimum of 32 Ether \u2014 worth $113,000. Mistakes can cause significant financial losses.\n\nBecause of this, many Ethereum users choose to stake through a third party provider.\n\nStaking providers usually take a percentage of rewards \u2014 between 10% and 25% \u2014 in exchange for helping their users stake.\n\nAt the low end, Lido, Binance Staked ETH, and Mantle Staked ETH charge a 10% fee on staking rewards.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Wrapped Staked ETH sits on the high end, charging 25%.\n\nMetaMask\u2019s 15% Pooled Staking fee, Saint Olive says, falls somewhere in the middle.\n\n\u201cUsers care more about the rewards they actually receive, and how secure the solution is, rather than the provider fee itself,\u201d Saint Olive said.\n\nSecurity and convenience\n\nThe new offering may appeal to more casual crypto users because of its convenience.\n\nMetaMask users can start staking their Ether via the wallet\u2019s interface.\n\nHowever, MetaMask also gives users the option to stake through rival staking providers Lido and Rocket Pool \u2014 both of which offer lower staking fees \u2014 through the same interface.\n\nAs for security, Pooled Staking will use the same staking system used by Consensys Staking, the firm\u2019s enterprise-grade staking product.\n\nConsensys says it has received third-party security certifications for both Consensys Staking and MetaMask.\n\nConsensys Staking has 33,000 Ethereum validators with more than 1 million Ether staked, equivalent to 3.3% of all staked Ether, according to the Pooled Staking announcement.\n\nEven so, it says it has never had one of its validators get slashed.\n\nSlashing is when the Ethereum network takes Ether from validators who don\u2019t publish data when they are supposed to, or don\u2019t publish the correct data.\n\nIn November, Bitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, suffered a $200,000 loss after nearly 100 of its validators were slashed for trying to publish incorrect data.\n\nIn October, 20 of Lido\u2019s validators were also slashed, costing the protocol $45,000.\n\nTim Craig is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "In the NFT market, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) took center stage with revenues exceeding $4.27 million. The Ethereum Name Service uses NFT technology in its decentralized URL method on the Ethereum blockchain, even though it isn\u2019t an NFT collection per se. Users may convert addresses on Ethereum into formats that are simple to read with this method. In essence, an ENS domain registration grants you a distinct NFT that is linked to the domain name of your choice, which you can then transfer or sell as with any other NFT.\n\nDiverse Range of Top Sellers\n\nFollowing closely behind ENS, the $PIZZA BRC-20 NFTs, hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain, secured the second position with $2.18 million in sales. Even though it topped the charts on Sunday with $7.12 million, sales of this collection fell. With $1.24 million in sales, Guild of Guardians Avatars on the Immutable network took third place.\n\nWith sales of $987,910, the Blast\u2019s Fantasy Top collection came in fourth place, and with $635,539 in sales, the Genesis Fanta Field collection on Solana made its debut in the top 10. With $583,411 in sales, the DMarket collection, a component of the Mythos network also left its impact, coming in sixth.\n\nWith $470,907 in sales, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a flagship NFT from Yuga Labs and the second-highest seller ever, finished the day in eighth place. The OKX NFT Creation series, based in Polygon, came in just behind, taking eighth place with $414,817 in sales. With sales of about $350,000 apiece, two more Polygon collections Matr1x Fire Weapon and TTAvatars rounded out the top 10.\n\nBlockchain Breakdown\n\nRegarding the blockchain, Ethereum, under the leadership of ENS, commanded the most daily sales amounting to $8.45 million, a notable rise over $4.51 million the day before. The daily sales volume on the Bitcoin blockchain was $4.11 million, a decrease from the $11.03 million that was reported on June 9. Sales on the Solana blockchain were $2.68 million, however transactions on the Polygon blockchain totaled $2.44 million, which was a greater volume. Immutable recorded $1.56 million in sales, while the Blast blockchain recorded $988,646 in sales.\n\nIn summary, ENS\u2019s surge in NFT sales, alongside a diverse range of collections and blockchain activity, underscores the growing prominence and dynamism of the NFT market."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices wavered Wednesday as investors parsed commentary from the Federal Reserve that provided new insight into the U.S. central bank\u2019s fight against inflation.\n\nPolicymakers\u2019 move to leave interest rates unchanged for an 11th consecutive month was a foregone conclusion, based on movements in Fed futures markets. At its most restrictive position in over 20 years, the Fed kept its benchmark borrowing rate at a range between 5.25% and 5.50%.\n\nThis month\u2019s release of a so-called \u201cdot plot,\u201d however, suggested shot callers at the U.S. central bank have seen a notable shift in financial conditions since March. The Fed in its most recent Summary of Economic Projections had penciled in three rate cuts through years-end.\n\nThe dot plot released Wednesday suggested Fed policymakers now think one rate cut could be more appropriate\u2014interpreted by the market as a hawkish sign. The projection went beyond the two rate cuts that economists had expected the Fed could telegraph, as it looks to keep rates higher for longer in the face of a strong economy and U.S. labor market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptocurrency prices had risen earlier in the day on news that inflation had slowed to 3.3% in the 12 months through May. The report indicated that consumer prices for American goods and services rose slightly less last month than economists had expected.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s announcement, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell. Just 15 minutes after the Fed\u2019s move, for example, Bitcoin\u2019s price swiftly fell 1.2% to around $69,000 from $69,900. Meanwhile, the prices of Ethereum and Solana also ticked down at similar rates.\n\nThe Fed has maintained in recent months that it will not cut rates until it has \u201cgained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed that stance on Wednesday and said, \u201cSo far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,\u201d Powell added in a statement. \u201cIn recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s policy meeting, futures traders penciled in a 61% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, likely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing rates. That figure fell to 59% following the release of Powell\u2019s written remarks.\n\nNot long before U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed began lifting interest rates from near-zero to cool a red-hot economy. While inflation has come down significantly since then, Powell affirmed Wednesday that the U.S. central bank\u2019s quest to 2% isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nPowell pointed to Wednesday\u2019s Consumer Price Index report, where inflation was flat on a month-to-month basis in May, as a sign of potential progress. \u201cLet me say that we welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals,\u201d Powell added, of which one is \u201cmaximum employment\u201d among U.S. workers.\n\nThe price of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, typically face pressure as interest rates rise and the payouts on holding cash and U.S. Treasuries become more attractive. Investors anticipate the opposite would happen as the Fed loosens U.S. monetary conditions.\n\n\u201cWe can't know what the future holds, but in the meantime, we've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance,\u201d Powell said, adding that the Fed is looking for a gradual decline in inflation and greater balance in the labor market. \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress here.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add a further quote from Powell.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices Pop as US Inflation Growth Slows - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies popped Wednesday after a widely watched inflation gauge showed that U.S. consumer prices increased last month by less than economists had expected.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.3% in the 12 months through May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists\u2019 forecast of 3.4%. Previously, the index tracking American goods and services showed that consumer prices rose 3.4% annually.\n\nImmediately following the report\u2019s release, Bitcoin jumped 2.8% to around $69,500 from $67,900. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Solana, showed gains of over 3% over the past day, but their prices had still fallen over the past week after Friday\u2019s flash crash.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite opened in the green. The move came just hours before the Federal Reserve\u2019s June policy meeting, where the U.S. central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady for an 11th straight month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Fed\u2019s decision loomed, Bitcoin is nearing a price of $70,000 as of this writing, showing gains of over 4% over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, U.S. inflation was flat. The reading followed a 0.3% bump in consumer prices in April and a 0.4% increase in March and February.\n\nWhile investors had already anticipated that Fed policymakers would leave interest rates untouched Wednesday, rate cut hopes for September strengthened, however. That chance rose after the report\u2019s release to 62% from 46%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\n\nLikely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing costs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that policymakers need \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation is heading to its target of 2% annually before loosening monetary policy through rate cuts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShifting rate cut expectations dented Bitcoin\u2019s price in April, knocking the cryptocurrency away from all-time highs above $73,000 a month prior. However, analysts say Bitcoin could test those prices again as a path toward rate cuts emerges with more certainty and a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cAt this point, my confidence in Fed rate cuts is pretty high,\u201d Grayscale's Head of Research Zach Pandl said on Twitter (aka X), adding that rate cuts becoming a base case again is good for the strength of Bitcoin relative to the dollar in a separate post.\n\nLow Core CPI inflation in May => Fed rate cuts again the base case => bad for Dollar, good for Bitcoin $BTC pic.twitter.com/2Ntlfl3iJs \u2014 Zach Pandl (@LowBeta_) June 12, 2024\n\nMarkets largely shrugged at hotter-than-expected U.S. job growth last Friday. Still, hours after the figures were released, Bitcoin plunged alongside the rest of the crypto market, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of liquidations in leveraged crypto positions.\n\nOn Wednesday, the dollar value of liquidated positions was comparatively muted. Within the past four hours, $10 million worth of crypto long positions have been purged, while bearish traders saw $39 million worth of short positions be closed, per data from CoinGlass.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF S-1s will likely be approved by the end of the summer, says SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nEthereum exchange reserves have declined by about $4 billion in past two weeks.\n\nEthereum derivatives data reveal divergent sentiment among short-term and long-term traders.\n\nEthereum's (ETH) price was down nearly 5% on Thursday as Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler suggested spot ETH ETFs will likely receive approval over the course of the summer. The update was accompanied by mixed sentiment from derivatives traders.\n\nDaily digest market movers: ETH ETF summer launch, declining exchange reserves\n\nEthereum price could see a reversal after the latest development for spot ETH ETFs. Here is the latest news surrounding the top altcoin:\n\nAccording to Fox Business\u2019s Eleanor Terrett, SEC Chair Gary Gensler told Senator Bill Hagerty that spot ETH ETF S-1s will likely be approved \"over the course of the summer.\"\n\nAlso read: Ethereum poised for recovery following increased exchange outflows\n\nThe SEC approved issuers' 19b-4 filings on May 23 but also needs to greenlight their S-1s before spot ETH ETFs go live.\n\nMeanwhile, Framework Ventures co-founder Vance Spencer believes Ethereum is a \"tech-style growth play\" that will become the app store of finance.\n\n\"ETH is at the forefront of the tokenization movement that's really going to define the next few decades of traditional finance,\" he said.\n\n\"People are going to be really surprised at the uniqueness of the scale of business Ethereum is going to generate from the tokenization wave,\" Spencer added.\n\nRead more: Ethereum breaches key support, receives \u2018digital oil\u2019 tag from world's largest bank\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, ETH has seen over $1.5 billion in net exchange outflow since June 9. ETH's exchange reserve has also declined by nearly 1.2 million ETH, worth over $4 billion, since May 27. This indicates a bullish outlook for ETH despite declining prices.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum bearish sentiment likely temporary\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,434 on Thursday following a wider market decline after the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday.\n\nETH Open Interest (OI) declined by nearly 4% in the past 24 hours following the decline. Moreover, ETH options volume decreased by 51%, which shows options traders exercising caution.\n\nAdditionally, the ETH futures long/short ratio is at 0.88. A ratio below 1 shows the market is tending toward bears. However, this is likely a short-term bearish view, as traders may be looking to profit from the Federal Reserve's conservative outlook on interest rates.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum ecosystem sees impressive Q1 earnings, issuers plan to market ETH as the \u2018ultimate app store\u2019\n\nDeribit's options data shows that ETH's put/call ratio (PCR) is at 0.32, indicating strong bullish sentiment from traders. A PCR above 0.7 or exceeding 1 indicates traders are buying more puts than calls, suggesting prevailing bearish sentiment. A PCR below 0.7 and approaching 0.5 is considered a bullish indicator.\n\nAs a result, ETH is likely to see a reversal in the next few days and may steady around $3,730 to $3,900.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nThe launch of spot ETH ETFs will likely push the largest altcoin to a new all-time high above $4,878. A breach of the $3,300 support will invalidate the bullish thesis."

Before Ethereum ETFs can go live, they have to clear another hurdle. The SEC has yet to approve S-1 registration forms that contain in-depth information about the products that will be offered to the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late May, the agency requested updated S-1 forms from prospective issuers. \"Will be interested to see changes in the next batch of amended S-1s. There can't be *that* much work left to do,\" ETF analyst Nate Geraci said.\n\nJames Seyffart, a well-regarded Bloomberg analyst, appears to be confident that Ethereum ETFs will go live this summer. \"July was and is a complete guess. But I was more confident in saying that ETH ETFs will launch at some point this summer. That was sort of a given,\" he said in a post on the X social media network.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , JPMorgan predicted that Ethereum ETFs would attract modest inflows compared to Bitcoin ETFs."

        "content": "Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by global market cap, has again emerged as the talk of the crypto town today, June 12. The token recorded the withdrawal of over 300K coins from Coinbase recently, marking one of the largest exchange outflows of the year. This colossal outflow from Coinbase has stirred a whirlpool of speculations surrounding ETH\u2019s future price trajectory, tilting the balance toward the bullish side. Let\u2019s take a deeper dive into the token\u2019s on-chain statistics.\n\nOver 336K ETH Withdrawn From Coinbase\n\nAccording to a post shared by CryptoQuant on X, based on this year\u2019s data, it can be clearly seen that on June 11, the exchange outflow totaled 336,284 ETH. Of particular note, this is the fifth time this year that more than 150K ETH has been withdrawn from the exchange. This totals over $1 billion in value, adding a layer of intrigue to the withdrawals and Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics. The large transactions range between $400 million and $1.1 billion each.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlthough the exact cause of these withdrawals could vary, high chances prevail that whales or as-yet-unknown institutions have driven these withdrawals. Should this be true, ETH\u2019s long-term prospects shine with bullishness.\n\nCryptoQuant previously recorded similar activities orbiting ETH before the commencement of spot Bitcoin ETFs, deeming it to be due to traders\u2019 anticipation of an overall market rally. Similarly, the withdrawal valued over $1 billion comes in tandem with approval in spot ETH ETFs recently. Crypto market enthusiasts continue to extensively eye the token as ETH remains poised to face the implications of reduced supply on exchanges.\n\nAlso Read: Chainalysis Bags Dismissal In $80M Employment Contract Breach Lawsuit\n\nEthereum Price Jumps\n\nWhereas, after the data surfaced in the market, the ETH price gained 3.02% to trade at $3,641. The token\u2019s market cap jumped 3.33% to $437.54 billion.\n\nCoinglass data illustrated that ETH futures OI dipped 1.67% to $15.86 billion, followed by a derivatives volume dip of 1.80% to $25.58 billion. This data aligns with Ethereum\u2019s recent bearish turn, wherein the token plunged from the $3,800 level to even below $3,500.\n\nMeanwhile, the RSI hovered at around 46, hinting that the asset is in neutral territory. Should buying pressure further prevail in the market, as in the abovementioned case, ETH could witness a additional bolstered price movement ahead. Nonetheless, selling pressure encountered by the token poses a risk to price.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF To See Majority Inflows Linked To Arbitrage, Here\u2019s Why\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMetaMask, a leading Ethereum wallet and browser extension, has launched its pooled staking service, allowing users to stake any amount of ETH.\n\nEthereum staking is the mechanism by which validators on the proof of stake network participate in consensus, or the verification of transactions before they're added to the blockchain. If their nodes process blocks of transactions that are online and process blocks when assigned, they collect rewards. And if they don't, they can see their staked ETH slashed as a penalty.\n\nBut users need 32 ETH to become a validator\u2014a criteria that 99% of holders fall short of, MetaMask said in its press release.\n\nThe pooled staking will allow MetaMask users to stake any amount of ETH and earn rewards for contributing to the network's security. The service is currently available to a small group of users, with a broader rollout expected soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, it will not initially be available in the United States or United Kingdom.\n\nThe crackdown on staking services in the U.S. has been severe. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Kraken $30 million in a settlement over charges that its crypto staking service constituted an unregistered offering of securities. Coinbase saw its staking service curtailed after the SEC made similar allegations against the San Francisco-based crypto exchange.\n\nIn the U.K., things are a bit less dire\u2014but still unclear.\n\nEconomic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami promised in Feburary this year that staking and stablecoin rules would be read in six months. When asked about progress during a Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit, he said he's still confident the rules will be implemented.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"What I\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins,\" Afolami said during the London event. \"Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSome members of the Ethereum community have seen the regulatory pressure or lack of clarity as an opportunity to further decentralize the network. As it stands, the U.S. accounts for 50% of all validator nodes on the network, followed by Germany with 12%, South Korea with 6%, and the UK with 4%, according to Etherscan.\n\nMatthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at Consensys\u2014the company behind Metamask\u2014emphasized the simplicity and control offered by the new service. \u201cMetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-grade validators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards, and making Ethereum more secure,\u201d he said.\n\nMetaMask's pooled staking is backed by Consensys Staking, which manages over 33,000 Ethereum validators and more than 1 million ETH staked. The company boasted in its press release that its has zero slashed validators and a 99.9% validator participation rate.\n\nMetaMask's move into pooled staking pits it against established players like Lido and Coinbase, which does still offer its staking service internationally and in several U.S. states. Together the two providers account for almost 45% of the 33 million ETH\u2014worth $116 billion at the time of writing\u2014that's been staked on the network.\n\nLido, the largest liquid staking platform, allows users to stake ETH and receive Lido Staked Ethereum (stETH) tokens, which can be used in DeFi applications while earning an annual percentage yield (APY) around 3.8%. The project's extensive liquidity and integration with numerous dApps make it a formidable competitor.\n\nMeanwhile Coinbase, though it has had to cut back on its staking service availability, is still the second-largest pooled staking provider by a wide margin. Its 15% portion is three times the size of the next couple competitors Figment, Ether.fi, and Kiln.fi."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Update Key Week Ahead for SEC Comments on S-1 Filings - CoinGape",
        "content": "This week is significant for the crypto market as the SEC is expected to respond to S-1 filings for Ethereum ETFs. Since the inaugural May 31st submission deadline, industry players expect a response from the regulatory body within the week, which may shape the course of Ethereum-based investment products.\n\nEthereum ETF Applicants Await Crucial SEC Feedback\n\nWith the clock ticking on the SEC\u2019s review period for Ethereum ETF applications, issuers submitting their proposals are getting increasingly nervous. After the SEC recently allowed a spot in Ethereum ETF, people anticipated quick action on S-1 registrations. However, until now, issuers have not received any response from the commission, headed by its chairman, Gary Gensler. Following the first draft submission deadline, the timing of this communication has generated a lot of anxiety in the sector.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs cited on social media platform X by Nate Geraci, sources close to the SEC have indicated that at least one of the applicants is expected to get the long-awaited comments by the end of this week. Based on this information, Stakeholders have expressed hope and doubt, given that the SEC has not been known to act quickly regarding cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the recent retraction by Ark Invest, which had initially expressed interest in launching an Ethereum ETF in partnership with 21Shares, points to the risks and ambiguity that define this endeavor.\n\nSEC\u2019s Mixed Signals Stir ETH ETF Market Anxiety\n\nAdding to the confusion, the SEC has not been clear on its stand on the matter, which was not helped by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s recent comments on CNBC. Although the 19b-4 applications for a spot in Ethereum ETF got the green light, the absence of communication after the deadline has created suspense and concerns among potential issuers. This case shows how the SEC has to walk a thin line between promoting innovation and protecting investors in the risky crypto space.\n\nDespite these challenges, the interest in Ethereum as a viable investment vehicle remains strong. In its official statement, Ark Invest did not change its view on Ethereum\u2019s potential and long-term value, even if it had to give up on its ETF dreams. This sentiment is prevalent across the industry, as the conviction in Ethereum\u2019s establishment in the digital asset ecosystem remains strong.\n\nAs the week progresses, financial analysts watch the SEC\u2019s next moves. Major financial entities like JPMorgan have expressed caution, suggesting that the inflow into spot Ethereum ETF might be less than some expect. However, an approving nod from the SEC could significantly alter this outlook, potentially unlocking a new wave of institutional and retail investment into Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Vitalik Buterin Spotlights Ethereum Layer 2 Progress, Hints Next Milestone\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Biaoqing\n\nBeijing, China, June 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- It\u2019s no longer rumour that Biaoqing coin is going to be listed on popular Exchange Bitmart: and other leading exchanges would be coming onboard soon.\n\nBiaoqing Launched on June 9th on the Ethereum blockchain, $BIAO has experienced remarkable price growth. In less than a day, its market cap soared from a few thousand dollars to more $6 million, capturing the attention of the crypto space.\n\nThe team has big plans for the Biaoqing project. They are already listed on CoinMarketCap, the biggest crypto data aggregator, and are marketing in every way possible: billboards in the busiest places around the world, trending on various platforms (X, Telegram, dextools, etc.), partnerships with crypto influencers and crypto hedge funds, and many other initiatives. They are also hosting regular Twitter Spaces to keep the community updated and plan to continue their efforts to market $BIAO internationally.\n\n$BIAO is a memecoin based on the biggest meme that ever existed in China and the eastern world in general: Biaoqing. Biaoqing features a series of facial expressions printed on the head of a panda. It is a real phenomenon in Asia, to the point that it's impossible not to have seen it in any of their group chats. The Biaoqing faces are used as frequently as Westerners use their emojis. Like many other famous memes before them, $BIAO aims to rally memecoin enthusiasts around a meme that has never been truly presented in the crypto sphere.\n\nBecause of its narrative of being the \"Pepe of China,\" $BIAO immediately showed a lot of potential. The numerous Biaoqing memes surrounding the project, as well as their qualitative branding, contributed to its viral potential. The Biaoqing faces are hilarious and have tremendous potential to capture the hearts of every meme lover.\n\nIt is important to note that, like every other successful memecoin before it, $BIAO has a lot of originality. Western memes are saturating the market, and we've seen almost all of them represented by a token. But Eastern memes are still absent from the memecoin space, leaving a big gap to be filled. With Biaoqing being the number one meme in China, this could start a new trend. All of this suggests that $BIAO will most likely have a bright future.\n\n$BIAO is available on Uniswap, a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network, without transaction taxes. It will also be listed on centralized exchanges, which, considering their tremendous trading volume, should happen very soon.\n\nWith a strong team, hilarious memes, extensive connections, the true originality of being the biggest meme in Asia, and aggressive marketing, Biaoqing shows promise. However, potential investors should conduct their own research before investing. Trade safely!\n\nStory continues\n\nSocials:\n\nWebsite: https://biaoqing.live/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/biaoerc20\n\nX(Twitter): https://x.com/biaoerc20\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "ICBC: the largest bank in the world bets on the crypto Ethereum (ETH) - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "ICBC, the largest bank in the world, claims that the crypto Ethereum represents the driving technical force of the digital future, defining it as \u201cdigital oil\u201d. At the same time, it describes Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\n\nAccording to the bank ICBC, the crypto Ethereum is \u2018the digital oil of the 21st century\u2019\n\nAs anticipated, the largest bank in the world, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), is defining Bitcoin (BTC) as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and Ethereum (ETH) as \u201cdigital oil\u201d.\n\nIn a new report shared by Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets at VanEck, the ICBC praises the two main criptovalute by market capitalization.\n\nThe report indicates that the market demand for digital assets is robust, driving innovation in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe market demand drives the continuous evolution of digital currencies.\u201d\n\nThe report compares Bitcoin to gold, highlighting that the cryptocurrency has additional advantages:\n\n\u201cBitcoin maintains scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus, while simultaneously solving issues related to its divisibility, authenticity, and transportability. Its monetary attributes are weakening, while its asset attributes are strengthening.\u201d\n\nDefining Ethereum as \u201cdigital oil,\u201d the report praises the various features of the ecosystem of the leading smart contract platform. Although ICBC highlights some shortcomings of the network, it believes that technological progress will resolve them over time.\n\n\u201cEthereum has consistently improved its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing a technical foundation for the digital future.\u201d\n\nSustainability, security, and efficiency\n\nFurthermore, the report reiterates how Ethereum introduces Turing completeness with its unique programming language (Solidity) and the virtual machine (EVM).\n\nAllowing developers to create a wide range of smart contracts and complex applications, providing strong support to blockchain technology.\n\nNot surprisingly, says the report, its flexibility is widely recognized in the sectors of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and it is also expanding to physical infrastructure networks (DePin).\n\n\u201cIn essence, the Turing completeness of Ethereum allows it to execute any programming instruction with the necessary resources and correct instructions, but it also poses several practical challenges. Looking to the future, Ethereum developers will continue to work to balance sustainability, security, and efficiency.\u201d\n\nEthereum under pressure: bear forecasts dominate the market\n\nEthereum, the second cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is going through a difficult period.\n\nIts price has indeed failed to surpass the threshold of 4,000 dollars, generating concern among traders and investors.\n\nTo better understand the current market dynamics, it is useful to observe the behavior of the participants in the futures market, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAn important indicator is the Taker Buy Sell ratio, which measures the relative aggressiveness of buyers compared to sellers.\n\nA ratio greater than one indicates that buyers are more aggressive, while a ratio less than one shows greater aggressiveness on the part of sellers.\n\nExamining the 7-day moving average chart of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio for Ethereum, it is noted that the ratio, which has never exceeded one, has collapsed in recent days.\n\nThis indicates that the sellers have been more active in the futures market, continuing to sell short or to cash in the profits from the gains at the beginning of the year.\n\nA drop so marked in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio is not generally a positive sign for Ethereum. In fact, it indicates that the majority of futures traders are bear on Ethereum and expect a further price drop of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the macroeconomic context, several factors could reverse this trend. Good news, such as new partnerships, technological discoveries, or regulatory approvals, could restore investor confidence and drive up the price of Ether."

It compared BTC to gold, citing that it \u201cretains the scarcity similar to gold through mathematical consensus while solving [gold\u2019s] problem of being difficult to divide, difficult to identify authenticity, and inconvenient to carry.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nNext, ICBC named Ethereum as digital oil, citing its crucial role in serving as a strong support to numerous Web3.0 innovations including the launch of stablecoins.\n\n\u201cEthereum has been continuously upgrading its technology in terms of security, scalability and sustainability, providing technical power for the digital future. In addition, the introduction and development of stablecoins provide a bridge for the digital currency market to connect to the real world,\u201d ICBC highlighted.\n\nThe bank acknowledged the fact that Ethereum has its programming language known as Solidity but more importantly, ICBC highlighted how the network supports developers. Per the bank\u2019s published statement, ETH allows developers to deploy complex smart contracts as well as Decentralized Applications (DApps). ICBC believes strongly that this has made Ethereum the mainstay in inventive new fields like Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nFurthermore, the top China-based bank sees this sentiment transcending gradually to the physical infrastructure network.\n\nCommunity Awaits Final Approval For spot Ethereum ETF\n\nICBC\u2019s endorsement for the altcoin comes while the crypto industry is waiting for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to finally approve spot Ethereum ETF trading. The regulator has requested the submission of amended and updated S-1 registration from all Ethereum ETF applicants.\n\nLast week, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman hinted at the possibility of a slow process for the final spot Ethereum ETF trading approval. In his words, the approval of the necessary S-1 forms \u201cwill take some time.\u201d\n\nIt is worthy of note that after the submission of the S-1 applications, the Commission would provide filers with its first feedback which will in turn prompt more changes to be made.

        "content": "How are the crypto Pepe (PEPE), Kaspa (KAS), and Ethereum (ETH) performing? Below is an overview of current and future prices and the latest news featuring them.\n\nFluctuations in the price of Pepe: return to the all-time high or descent towards critical support?\n\nWhen the price of Bitcoin fell below the crucial support level of $68,000, the meme coin sector experienced a significant contraction, with the main cryptocurrencies in this segment seeing a substantial loss of value.\n\nAmong the most affected tokens, PEPE has continued to show a marked bear trend, recording a correction in the last 24 hours.\n\nWith the bearish sentiment dominating the market, a question arises spontaneously: will the price of Pepe manage to retest its all-time high (ATH) or will it slip towards the critical support level of $0.00000880?\n\nAfter a week of weak performance, Pepe managed to regain momentum, recording an impressive growth of 157.85% before encountering a pullback at the resistance level of $0.00001150.\n\nThe bulls managed to reclaim the support level of $0.00000880, which led to a doubling of the price over the next eight days, culminating in a new ATH of $0.00001718 on May 27.\n\nHowever, after reaching this new all-time high, Pepe experienced a sharp bear reversal.\n\nSince then, the price of the coin has been traded under strong selling pressure, indicating a negative influence for the meme coin in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIf the price manages to stay above the support level of $0.00001150, the bulls could regain momentum, potentially pushing the price of PEPE to test the resistance level of $0.00001410.\n\nFurthermore, if the bull manage to keep the price at that level, Pepe could be preparing to retest its previous ATH within the current month.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bear were to prevail, the price of Pepe could drop below the support level of $0.00001151 and head towards the critical support of $0.00000880 in the coming weeks.\n\nKaspa ready to reach the all-time high after overcoming the key resistance\n\nThe proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency Kaspa seems ready to reclaim its all-time high of $0.18, after surpassing the long-term resistance level located at $0.14.\n\nBetween April 12 and June 2, the price of KAS oscillated within a range, forming a horizontal channel. The upper part of the channel acts as resistance, while the lower part represents support. KAS found resistance at $0.14 and support at $0.1.\n\nSince the beginning of June, KAS has recorded a significant increase in trading volume. For example, on June 3, the daily trading volume of the altcoin reached 165 million dollars, the highest level since November 2023, according to data from Santiment.\n\nThis increase in trading activity pushed the price of KAS above the upper line of its horizontal channel on June 3, indicating a close above the resistance.\n\nThe analysis of price movements on a daily chart suggests that KAS could continue its bull trend.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) and the money flow index (MFI) of the altcoin were respectively at 79.91 and 70.44, confirming an increase in demand. These indicators show that the buying pressure on KAS has surpassed the selling pressure.\n\nThe price of the crypto Ethereum compared to PEPE and Kaspa\n\nThe recent data from CryptoQuant has highlighted a bear phase for Ethereum (ETH), with futures traders showing a strong selling bias.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is closely watching these developments, especially as Ethereum struggles to stay above $3,500, adding further pressure to an already unstable market.\n\nThe data from CryptoQuant provides an insight into the current market conditions of Ethereum, suggesting a possible continuation of the negative trend. The analysis focuses on the \u201cTaker Buy Sell Ratio,\u201d a key indicator of market sentiment in the futures sector.\n\nThis metric measures the balance between buying and selling activities: a ratio above 1 indicates a predominance of buyers, reflecting greater buying pressure, while a value below 1 highlights aggressive selling.\n\nUnfortunately for investors and Ethereum enthusiasts, this ratio has recently fallen below 1, indicating that sellers are outnumbering buyers.\n\nThis bearish trend is confirmed by the significant drop in the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which has shown a clear shift towards the dominion of the sellers.\n\nAggressive sales could be driven by traders looking to capitalize on speculative gains or reduce risks in a context of high market volatility.\n\nThe persistence of this trend represents a worrying signal for the short-term prospects of Ethereum, which struggles to find stable support levels.\n\nThe cryptocurrency analyst Shayan BTC, who shared this update on the quick-take platform of CryptoQuant, observed:"

After hitting resistance at about $3,800, Ethereum entered a consolidation phase. The current decline that we have observed, which is frequently an indication of market indecision, was foreseen in this instance by sideways movement. Over the past few days, Ethereum's price has dropped significantly, approaching $3,500.\n\nThe market had been feeling bullish overall, so many people were surprised by this sudden decline. There are several possible reasons for this unforeseen behavior. Initial liquidity issues could be crucial. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment are always important. Ethereum's performance may have been impacted by recent global financial trends, regulatory news or even bigger sell-offs on the market. It is also critical to keep in mind that fluctuations in Bitcoin (such as the decline below $70,000) frequently have an impact on the entire cryptocurrency market, including Ethereum.\n\nTechnical indicators show that there was a significant sell-off of ETH in a short period of time. Reentry by buyers onto the market may indicate potential for expansion. Moving averages also show another concerning pattern: the shorter-term MAs crossing below the longer-term MAs, which is typically a bearish signal. Despite the recent downturn, Ethereum's fundamentals remain strong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin is struggling\n\nBitcoin is struggling to cross the $70,000 threshold for a number of reasons. The significant lack of purchasing power is one of the main causes. Bitcoin's price previously reached all-time highs due to significant capital inflows.\n\nA decreasing number of new purchasers are nevertheless willing to make these high-level investments, according to the state of the market. The lack of buying interest is making it difficult for Bitcoin to surpass the psychological $70,000 barrier.\n\nThe change in institutional behavior is another important component. Institutions are now shifting money away from Bitcoin ETFs despite the fact that they were crucial to Bitcoin's earlier rallies. This change is partially the result of people looking for better returns in alternative asset classes or new developments in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe potential price of Bitcoin is weakened by diminished institutional support because a significant portion of the buying pressure that raised prices came from these large-scale investors.\n\nFurthermore, strong fundamental drivers that have historically sparked enormous bull runs are absent from Bitcoin at the moment. While the NFT craze played a similar role in 2021, the ICO boom in 2017 propelled Bitcoin to previously-unheard-of heights. There is currently no trend or invention like this propelling investor capital and enthusiasm toward Bitcoin on a large scale.\n\nThe struggles of Bitcoin are also reflected in technical indicators. It appears that neither overbought nor oversold conditions exist as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been circling around neutral. This neutral RSI adds to the general sense of indecisiveness and uncertainty on the market, further impeding any meaningful price movement.\n\nXRP in trouble\n\nXRP's current state is really problematic. The asset has lost numerous key support levels like the 50 EMA, psychological levels at $0.5 and others. Such performance certainly puts XRP down on the list of better-performing assets. However, the only question now is: will it reach the yearly low of $0.44?\n\nXRP has been steadily losing value over the last few weeks as it has been in a downtrend. The first real red flag appeared when the 50-day EMA disappeared. After that, XRP dropped below both the critical psychological support level of $0.5, which is represented by the orange line on the 100-day EMA, further deteriorating its technical outlook.\n\nThe annual low of $0.44 is the next significant support level for XRP. The likelihood of reaching this level appears to be growing given the state of the market and technical indicators. There is a long-term bearish trend indicated by the 200-day EMA, which is still significantly above the current price.\n\nThe absence of significant purchasing power is one of the primary causes of XRP's downfall. The asset finds it difficult to hold onto its value, much less increase it in the absence of substantial buy-side interest. Due to investor caution brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties, the overall market conditions for cryptocurrencies are currently not very favorable."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) has declined to around $3,500, but analysts predict potential new all-time highs due to positive technical indicators.\n\nMetrics such as negative exchange netflow and a low RSI suggest reduced selling pressure and possible price recovery.\n\nIs It Time for a Resurgence?\n\nThe price of Ethereum (ETH), similar to many other cryptocurrencies, plunged significantly in the past several days. Currently, the second-biggest digital asset in terms of market capitalization is worth around $3,500 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), a 9% decline on a weekly scale.\n\nNonetheless, some analysts think ETH will face good days ahead, with some speculating about a new all-time high in the following months. The X users Wolf and Jelle are some examples.\n\nThe former presented a price chart showing that ETH has been on a bullish path since the beginning of 2024. The analyst envisioned enhanced volatility for the asset in the upcoming future, which will eventually lead to a bull run and a new all-time high price of over $5,000.\n\nJelle claimed that ETH \u201csuccessfully retested the 50-day EMA.\u201d The analyst believes the asset\u2019s valuation could reach fresh peaks once it surpasses the $3,700 zone.\n\nThe 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is an important technical analysis tool that could suggest a potential price movement. It helps identify prevailing trends in the past 50 days but with a bigger focus on the most recent data, unlike the SMA, and provides insights into potential buy and sell levels.\n\n\n\nWhat Are Metrics Signaling?\n\nSeveral major indicators also hint that an ETH price revival might be in the cards. One example is Ethereum\u2019s exchange netflow, which has been negative in the last four days. A shift from centralized trading platforms towards self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) plummeted on June 11 to a multi-month low of 20.7, currently positioned at 36. The metric has not crossed the 70 mark since May 23.\n\nIt is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price fluctuations and identifies overbought or oversold conditions in a market. Its value varies from 0 to 100, with a ratio above 70 suggesting a pullback might be imminent."

        "content": "Ethereum recently saw over $1 billion outflow from exchanges.\n\nETH\u2019s price has increased by over 1%\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been experiencing a decline in price over the last few days. However, despite these declines, the exchange outflow and accumulation metrics have been moving in opposite directions. What does this mean for the ETH trend?\n\nEthereum takes hits\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price trend on a daily time frame showed that it experienced its biggest daily decline in over a month on 11th June.\n\nThe chart indicated that its price dropped by almost 4.6%, falling from over $3,600 to around $3,500. This decline marked the peak of the capitulation that had been occurring over the last seven days.\n\nThe analysis showed that these declines pushed Ethereum into a bear trend, as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell below the neutral line. As of this writing, the RSI remained below the neutral line.\n\nAdditionally, the price has seen a slight recovery with an increase of over 1%, trading at around $3,500. The short moving average (yellow line) continued to provide support at around $3,300.\n\nWhales continue to accumulate Ethereum\n\nAn analysis of whale addresses on Santiment showed that these addresses have continued to accumulate as Ethereum\u2019s price declined.\n\nThe chart indicated that the number of addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH rose from 1,040 to 1,049 as of this writing.\n\nAdditionally, the data revealed that whales had bought over 240,000 ETH, worth around $840 million, since the decline started.\n\nEthereum sees massive outflow\n\nAdditionally, the volume of outflows saw a recent spike, particularly from Coinbase, according to CryptoQuant data.\n\nData showed that Coinbase experienced its highest outflow of the year, with over 336,000 ETH leaving the exchange. The value of this outflow was approximately $1 billion.\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum\u2019s netflow showed that outflows have dominated in the last few days, with some notable spikes.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAt the end of trading on 11th June, the netflow was -307,000. As of this writing, the netflow remains negative at around -27,000.\n\nThese metrics indicate that more traders are buying ETH as its price declines."

        "content": "Thu 13 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem has recently attracted attention with significant activity from whales. This increased activity coincides with an anticipated rate cut in the United States! These two combined events herald an imminent Bull Run for crypto.\n\nCrypto: The Incredible Activity of Ethereum Whales!\n\nAccording to data provided by Santiment, whales have added more than 240,000 ETH to their wallets! This represents a value of over 840 million dollars in the past 48 hours. Additionally, +336,000 ETH were withdrawn from Coinbase in the past 24 hours, suggesting anticipation of a price increase!\n\nThe activity of Ethereum crypto whales\n\nThese massive capital moves are often the prelude to major bullish trends. Because, crypto whales and institutions are generally well-informed and positioned to capitalize on market fluctuations. Furthermore, the continued decline in Ethereum supply on centralized exchanges, reaching multi-year lows, reinforces the hypothesis of an imminent bull market.\n\nThe Rate Cut in the United States, a Precursor Sign of a Bull Market?\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum prices is all the more relevant as interest rates in the United States could be revised downward. Peter Brandt, a seasoned analyst, indicated that this is not the ideal time to speculate against Ether. Moreover, with the weakening of the US dollar against global currencies and increased crypto speculation, Ethereum could reach new historical highs.\n\nThese developments are crucial for investors and traders who monitor whale movements for market trend clues. The ability of whales to influence crypto market trends and liquidity is well documented. Moreover, their recent activity is a strong signal for those seeking to understand the complex market dynamics.\n\nThe activity of Ethereum whales and the possible rate cut are clear indicators of growing optimism in the market. Institutional investors and whales seem to be betting on a significant appreciation of Ethereum, which could lead to a period of prosperity for ETH holders and market participants.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Wed 12 Jun 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nCryptocurrencies are going through a tumultuous period, marked by a significant drop in prices. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two main cryptos, are particularly affected. This decline raises questions about the future of the market and the forces at play. Let\u2019s analyze this situation in detail.\n\nSelling Pressure: A Threat to Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, often perceived as a safe haven in the crypto sphere, is not immune to market fluctuations. The crucial support level to watch on the daily chart is $66,205. This threshold coincides with a major resistance line.\n\nA close below this level could intensify selling pressure, leading to a further drop in price.\n\nConversely, the most important resistance level for Bitcoin is $69,667. Recently, this level has generated strong resistance pressure, preventing the price from rising.\n\nA daily close above this threshold could rekindle the hope of an uptrend. However, investors need to stay cautious, as market movements are often unpredictable.\n\nIf the flagship crypto closes below $66,205, selling pressure could accelerate. This situation could push the price to new lows, further eroding investor confidence.\n\nIncreased market volatility heightens risks, making predictions difficult. Traders should therefore closely monitor these critical levels.\n\nEthereum: Between Consolidation and Selling Pressure\n\nEthereum, the second largest crypto, is also under significant pressure. On the daily chart, a consolidation has emerged after breaking out of a triangle pattern.\n\nThis consolidation is often a sign of stability, but the current selling pressure has broken the key support level.\n\nFor the ETH crypto, the most important support level is $3,502. A daily close below this level could trigger an increase in selling pressure, nullifying recent optimistic gains linked to ETFs. This situation would be concerning for investors who hoped for a sustainable rebound.\n\nThe key resistance level for this crypto is the 9 EMA average of $3,689. A daily close above this level could give a boost to the price, paving the way for a recovery. However, the market remains fragile, and investors need to stay vigilant against unpredictable fluctuations.\n\nIn the coming days, Ethereum\u2019s behavior around support and resistance levels will determine its trajectory.\n\nInvestors need to be ready to react quickly to market moves to minimize losses and maximize potential gains. Patience and caution are essential in this uncertain period.\n\nMacroeconomic Factors: A Determining Influence\n\nThe price fluctuations of Bitcoin and the ETH crypto cannot be fully understood without examining macroeconomic factors. The global economic situation plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency movements.\n\nEconomic reports, such as employment data in the United States, have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFor example, a recent report revealed stronger-than-expected job growth in May, contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s decline. This data influences investors\u2019 decisions and trading strategies.\n\nDecisions by central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, also affect cryptocurrencies. For example, lower interest rates can make risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. However, uncertainties around future central bank decisions add a layer of complexity to market analysis.\n\nOverall investor sentiment also plays a role. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can lead to massive sell-offs, while excessive optimism can lead to impulsive buying.\n\nInvestors need to stay informed and vigilant, adopting a proactive approach to managing risks. Caution is essential in this uncertain landscape. The future of cryptos remains promising, but the road is fraught with challenges. Indeed, the risk of liquidation persists around 71k.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program! For every article you read, earn points and access exclusive rewards.

        "content": "Wed 12 Jun 2024 \u25aa 5 min read \u25aa by Family Trading \u25aa\n\nAfter a rise of more than 20%, Ethereum\u2019s price is undergoing a bearish correction. Let\u2019s examine the future outlook for ETH together.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Situation\n\nAfter rising from $3,000 to $3,800 following the approval of Ethereum spot ETFs, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price stabilized before facing bearish pressure, bringing it down to $3,500. This decline was fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s slight drop, which pulled the entire cryptocurrency market with it. Currently, the cryptocurrency seems to be stabilizing, demonstrating renewed interest from buyers. At the time of writing this article, one Ether is worth slightly more than $3,500. Thus, it is below the $3,800 mark, which corresponds to the point of control noted since its last rebound.\n\n\n\nThe point of control (POC) refers to the price level with the highest trading volume over a given period, indicating a key support or resistance zone.\n\nThe next value area to consider is just below the Ethereum price level, specifically below the $3,000 mark. This area coincides with the identified support zone at the same price level.\n\nEthereum remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, continuing to confirm the idea that the cryptocurrency is in an uptrend. However, it should be noted that Ethereum\u2019s momentum is being revised downwards, as evidenced by the oscillators and Ethereum\u2019s own price.\n\nETH/USD Chart (1D)\n\nThe current technical analysis was conducted in collaboration with Elie FT, an investor and passionate trader in the cryptocurrency market. Today, he is a trainer at Family Trading, a community of thousands of self-employed traders active since 2017. You\u2019ll find Lives, educational content, and mutual support around the financial markets in a professional and friendly atmosphere.\n\nA Closer Look at Derivatives (ETHUSDT)\n\nThe open interest of perpetual contracts linked to Ethereum has recently followed the course of its underlying asset. Coupled with a still-positive funding rate, this demonstrates majority participation from buyers in Ethereum derivatives. However, it should be noted that, although positive, these rates have been slightly revised downwards, reflecting a slight capitulation from buyers. This phenomenon could be explained by increasing selling pressure, but also by liquidations, particularly marked on the buyers\u2019 side.\n\nOpen Interest / Liquidations & Funding rate ETH/USD\n\nThe liquidation heatmap of ETH/USDT over three months reveals that the liquidation zone at $3,700 was recently reached. It seems to have triggered buying interest that was not sustained, allowing the bearish movement to continue. Currently, the most significant liquidation zones are on both sides of the current price. Above, we can note the $3,900 zone. Below, we can note the $3,000 zone. The price approaching these levels could trigger a massive number of orders, thus increasing the risk of a period of heightened volatility for Ethereum. These zones therefore represent a crucial point of interest for investors.\n\nETH/USDT Liquidation Heatmap (3 months)\n\nHypotheses for Ethereum (ETH) Price\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price remains above $3,300, we could anticipate a bullish recovery up to $3,900 or even $4,000. The next resistance to consider would then be $4,100. If the upward movement continues, this could mark a new high at $4,500 and even reach Ethereum\u2019s ATH, just below $4,900. At this stage, it would represent a rise of more than 37%.\n\nIf Ethereum\u2019s price fails to stay above $3,300, we could envisage a return to around $3,000. The next support to consider, if the bearish movement continues, would be in a price range between $2,800 and $2,700. At this stage, it would represent a decrease of around -13%.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter an initial rise followed by stabilization, Ethereum\u2019s price has faced bearish pressure, partly due to a decline in the overall cryptocurrency market. Currently, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilization with renewed interest from buyers. Although these fluctuations cast doubt on Ethereum\u2019s future direction, its underlying trend remains bullish, favoring the idea of a potential rebound. However, it will be crucial to closely monitor the price\u2019s reaction to the different key levels to confirm or invalidate current hypotheses. It is also important to stay vigilant against potential \u201cfake outs\u201d and market \u201csqueezes\u201d in each scenario. Finally, let\u2019s remember that these analyses are based solely on technical criteria and that cryptocurrency prices can also evolve rapidly based on other more fundamental factors.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December\n\nAs the upcoming elections draw closer, former President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in various sectors, including cryptocurrency, could play a significant role. Many are wondering if Trump is a big crypto investor himself as recent data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that Trump reached a quick $33 million high last week. According to Arkham, he currently holds 475.6 ETH, worth $1.73 million.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIn December 2023, Trump sent over 1,000 Ethereum (ETH) tokens to Coinbase, presumably to sell. At the time, the Ethereum was worth $2.3 million. However, ETH has since performed well, and Trump may regret selling too soon.\n\nIf Trump were still holding all 1,075 ETH he sent to Coinbase, they would be worth around $3.9 million, nearly 60% higher than what he sold them for, as ETH reached higher than $3,600 today. If he held and sold now instead, Trump could have had $1.6 million more in his portfolio.\n\nWith many investment management firms aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, some experts believe that Ethereum\u2019s continued market share growth and its leading status among smart contract platforms could propel its value to a $2.2 trillion market cap, or approximately $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nTrending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nWhile Trump might regret his sale, the ETH was free. He acquired the tokens through an NFT project that utilized his name, image, and likeness, granting Trump royalties through his licensing deals.\n\nThe Trump Digital Trading Cards project was minted in December 2022 for $99 each. The 45,000 unique NFTs feature photos of Trump in different settings and poses. Currently, the cheapest NFT is on sale for a little less than $500 (0.14 ETH), and the most expensive sale goes for 37 ETH (worth nearly $150,000 at the time).\n\nHowever, the Trump NFT projects do not stop there. Trump released another project in late 2023, coined the \"Mugshot Edition,\" a nod to his legal troubles. It offered personalized rewards, with those who bought at least 47 Trump cards getting to have dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago and receiving a piece of the suit Trump wore for his mugshot when he was arrested in August.\n\nAs Trump continues to earn royalties and performs well on the campaign trail, it will be interesting to see how he manages his ETH position going into the presidential election in November. Mark Cuban said earlier this week on X, that crypto could be a big factor in tipping the scale in favor of Trump this November.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Here's How Much Trump Could Have Had Today If He Didn't Sell His Ethereum Back In December originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Price Reach $70,000 This Week As Ethereum, Solana Scream Buy? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto markets have been swimming in a sea of red in the last few days after Bitcoin price crashed to the $66,000 zone. Investors are now scanning the markets for optimal re-entry positions ahead of the next upward move. Key market-moving events this week include the FOMC meeting on June 12 and the Producer Price Index (PPI) data release on June 13. Market analysts anticipate that Bitcoin will react sharply to these developments.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum and Solana are also preparing for their next upward moves. Here is a complete breakdown of how these assets may perform in the coming days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Price Eyes $72,000 as ETF Volumes Hits ATH\n\nBitcoin price traded around $67,405 during European business hours on Wednesday, a 0.2% drop in the last 24 hours. With just 9 hours to go before the FOMC meeting, Bitcoin is struggling to stay above $67,000.\n\nBTC price action is trending above the 50-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMA), which is a bullish indicator for Bitcoin investors. The June 12 daily candle is also showing signs of a struggle and indecision between the bull and the bears.\n\nThe asset has been trending inside a consolidation zone for the past four weeks. Despite the slide in price, Bitcoin fundamentals remain strong, with BTC Spot ETF total cumulative flow surpassing $292 billion. This signals round 2 of massive accumulation. For comparison, the first round of BTC ETF accumulation saw Bitcoin surge from $38,000 to $73,000.\n\nWith this important metric underway, and with dovish comments from FOMC officials, Bitcoin price may hit and surpass $70,000 this week.\n\nEthereum Price Prepares to Test $3,600\n\nEther dropped by 7.6% to $3,521 over the last 7 days, following the market-wide crash. According to the recent Ethereum price prediction by CoinGape analysts, ETH had previously surged in price after the SEC approved 8 ETH ETFs. However, facts emerging later about the nature of the approved applications killed the hype. BlackRock is still pursuing the approval of its S-1 Form, which many Ethereum investors find bullish.\n\nEthereum price broke downward from a consolidation zone it had been in for about 3 weeks. Initially, the zone was part of a bull flag that usually resolves upwards. However, following Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price, the market structure was invalidated.\n\nEthereum may be preparing to bounce back upward, using $3,300 as support. Investors are waiting for the FOMC outcome in order to make their decisions later today. If bullish news graces the crypto space, Ethereum price may break back into the previous range and touch $4,000.\n\nSolana Price Flashes a Huge Buy Signal, $285 Target in the Works\n\nAlthough the recent general market downturn has affected many cryptocurrencies, Solana\u2019s price has braced the storm relatively well. Solana price prediction shows the staking token trading around $151 during European business hours on Wednesday, a 2% decrease in 24 hours and a further 12.9% decrease in 7 days. Nevertheless, SOL price action remains bullish and in an uptrend.\n\nSitting at a $69.7 billion market cap, Solana has been dominating the markets. Currently, the price action is trending above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) but below the 50-day moving average.\n\nSOL price has been making higher lows for 275 days straight, an impressive bullish streak. The asset is now in a symmetrical triangle, which may resolve in either direction. However, since Solana\u2019s price is in an uptrend, the chances of resolving upward may be higher than otherwise.\n\nA break above the symmetrical triangle may result in a 59% surge in price that will set the SOL price around $285. This will also be an all-time high price for the asset. Solana network has been an exceptional performer, with nearly half a million tokens launched in May 2024.\n\nOn its way up, SOL price may encounter resistance around $196, $228, and $267. Conversely, $132, $126, and $110 may provide robust support for the asset.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCrypto investors are eagerly awaiting the FOMC announcement in less than 10 hours (at press time). Expert forecasts point to no hikes or cuts, but officials\u2019 comments may either hurt or boost cryptocurrency prices. Investors are hoping for dovish comments from Jerome Powel and his counterparts to avoid further bleeding in the crypto markets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

        "title": "Why Ethereum saw long liquidations worth $62M in 24 hours - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH\u2019s long traders have witnessed significant liquidations in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe coin\u2019s options volume and Open Interest have also declined.\n\nEthereum [ETH] witnessed a spike in long liquidations on the 11th of June, according to Coinglass.\n\nInformation from the derivatives market data provider showed that the altcoin\u2019s long liquidations on that day represented its highest since the 23rd of May.\n\nIn an asset\u2019s derivatives market, liquidations happen when a trader\u2019s position is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it.\n\nLong liquidations happen when an asset\u2019s value drops unexpectedly, forcing traders with open positions in favor of a price rally to exit.\n\nOn the 11th of June, ETH long liquidations totaled $62 million, while short liquidations amounted to $7.3 million.\n\nDecline in ETH\u2019s derivatives market\n\nThe past 24 hours have been marked by a decline in ETH\u2019s derivatives market activity. For example, the total volume of trades executed in the altcoin\u2019s options market has dropped by 52%.\n\nDuring that period, options trading volume totaled $321 million.\n\nA decline in an options trading volume suggests fewer participants are buying or selling options.\n\nWhenever fewer trades are completed in an asset\u2019s options market, it becomes less liquid. This often results in wider bid-ask spreads, making it potentially more difficult for participants to execute trades at desired prices.\n\nIn addition, the coin\u2019s Open Interest has also dropped. At $15.73 billion at press time, it has fallen by 2% during the period under review.\n\nAn asset\u2019s Open Interest measures the total number of outstanding contracts or positions that have not been closed or settled. When it declines, more traders exit their positions without opening new ones.\n\nHowever, despite ETH\u2019s price decline in the past 24 hours, the ensuing long liquidations, and a drop in options volume and Open Interest, its Funding Rate across cryptocurrency exchanges has remained positive.\n\nAt press time, the coin\u2019s Funding Rate was 0.0069%. For context, the last time ETH\u2019s Funding Rate was negative was on the 3rd of May.\n\nFunding Rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s Funding Rate is positive, it suggests a strong demand for long positions.\n\nThis means more traders are buying the coin expecting to sell it at a higher price than those purchasing it in anticipation of a price decline."

        "content": "Crypto traders always look out for the best coin to invest in to earn exciting returns. The emergence of meme coins coupled with the value they possess has made them a great option for many investors and companies who trade in cryptocurrency. As time goes by, many more meme coins are introduced into the space, with each of them striving to be the most valuable.\n\nTop cryptocurrency blockchains are not left out in this race. They have created their version of meme coins which has also gone bullish since their day of launch. Two top blockchains with valuable meme coins in the market space are Tron and Ethereum.

This is one of the best coins to buy now and is promised to have a boost of 100X its presale token on launch day. So here is your chance to invest in a coin that will give you a greater value in the future.\n\nTron Is Rising\n\nThe meme coins on the Tron chain struggled to show significant growth when they were first released into the market. Despite being a part of a top cryptocurrency blockchain, these Tron chain coins showed low performances and holders found themselves regretting their decision to invest. However, recent market trends show that these coins are finally moving in the positive direction, causing holders to hang on a little.\n\nThe price of Tron has increased by 2.7% over the last week, and currently trades at $0.118. Tron's value is on the rise at the moment but is there a guarantee that it will be maintained? This is a question that bothers the minds of holders investing in the coin.\n\nEthereum Whales Predict An Enormous Rise In Value of ETH Soon\n\nEthereum whales are entities that can influence Ethereum cryptocurrency market because they hold a substantial amount of the coin. They wield a level of power and sometimes try to bend the market to their will. With the recent presale token of Raboo, Ethereum whales have hope for the future.\n\nThe current price of Ethereum is $3,518 and its value dropped by 4.7% in the last 24 hours. Now because Raboo operates under the Ethereum network, it could be great news for the coin. It is expected that ETH moves uptrend following the surge of Raboo, making Ethereum whales excited because they could use this to their advantage.\n\nRaboo: AI - Moneda meme que puede traer retornos masivos\n\nInvestors who are always on the market in search of an opportunity they can jump on, have discovered Raboo. With a cheap presale token of $0.0048 and a potential to rise to 233% before the end of the year, investors are not going to sleep on this offer at all. They believe that Raboo isn't just any coin and with time, they are going to enjoy an exponential return.\n\nRaboo is breaking new ground everyday and experts are running out of words to describe its potential. It is one of the best coins to buy now and you don't have to wait till launch day to start enjoying benefits.\n\n$RABT is an exciting coin with quality features that work with AI to produce memes that bind holders together. It fosters a community of meme coin enthusiasts where they can learn more about the basis of crypto and the growth of the $62 billion meme coin market.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the growth of Tron and the power of Ethereum whales in the market space, investors continue to focus on Raboo which is yet to be released. The potential of this meme coin is enormous and experts believe that it could be one of the leading coins in the future.\n\nYou can participate in the Raboo presale here:\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/RabootokenPortal\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Raboo_Official"

This statement, coming from a leading financial institution, marks an important recognition of the significance and potential of cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s global economy. By highlighting the unique qualities and distinctive roles of these two digital assets, ICBC draws attention to their growing place in an ever-evolving financial landscape.\n\nICBC elevates Bitcoin and Ethereum to the rank of strategic resources\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the largest bank in the world by assets, recently released a groundbreaking report that compares Bitcoin to digital gold and Ethereum to digital oil. This report marks a significant step in the recognition of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions. According to the ICBC report, \u201cBitcoin retains the scarcity similar to that of gold by mathematical consensus, while solving its problem of being difficult to divide, difficult to identify authenticity, and uncomfortable to transport.\u201d This statement highlights the transformation of Bitcoin, which has evolved from a mere potential currency to a robust and valuable financial asset.\n\nAt the same time, ICBC calls Ethereum \u201cdigital oil\u201c, emphasizing its central role in powering Web3 applications and programs. The report states that \u201cEthereum has continuously upgraded its technology in terms of security, scalability, and sustainability, providing the technical power for the digital future.\u201d This recognition illustrates the growing importance of Ethereum in the global digital ecosystem, serving as a crucial platform for innovations and decentralized applications.\n\nTowards a new era of financial recognition\n\n\u201cThe monetary attributes of Bitcoin are gradually weakening, while its asset attributes are constantly strengthening.\u201d The ICBC report also highlights the growing importance of Bitcoin in today\u2019s global financial system. By emphasizing its scarcity and robustness as an asset, the bank shows how Bitcoin has evolved to become a store of value, comparable to gold in the physical world. This analysis confirms the gradual transformation of Bitcoin\u2019s attributes, where its qualities as an asset are constantly strengthening at the expense of its initial monetary attributes.\n\nThe ICBC report also highlights the crucial role of Ethereum in the digital economy. Analysts explain that \u201cthe introduction and development of stablecoins provide a bridge for the digital currency market to connect to the real world.\u201d This functionality positions Ethereum as an indispensable platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By facilitating the connection between the digital market and the real world, Ethereum enhances its utility and relevance in the global financial landscape.\n\nEthereum\u2019s innovative technology is also highlighted by ICBC. The report underscores Ethereum\u2019s capability to enable the creation of complex smart contracts via its virtual machine (EVM) and programming language (Solidity). These technical innovations have allowed Ethereum to become the backbone of many decentralized applications, strengthening its role in the future digital infrastructure. By continuously improving its security, scalability, and sustainability, Ethereum positions itself as a robust and reliable platform for future applications.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Toncoin has seen more daily active addresses than Ethereum since the beginning of the month.\n\nTON\u2019s weighted sentiment was positive for the first time since June started.\n\nToncoin [TON], the blockchain network linked to the popular messaging app Telegram, has seen more demand than the leading Layer 1 blockchain, Ethereum [ETH], since the beginning of June.\n\nAccording to on-chain data provider Artemis, the number of unique addresses that have completed at least one transaction on Toncoin has exceeded that of Ethereum for ten out of the last 12 days.\n\nIn fact, on 3rd June, the daily count of unique addresses on Toncoin surged to a year-to-date high of 568,300, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s 351,400 by 62%.\n\nFurther, due to this, the daily count of unique interactions on both networks has differed considerably. According to Artemis, Toncoin has recorded more daily transactions than Ethereum every day since 12th March.\n\nOn 17th May, Toncoin\u2019s daily transactions count rallied to a year-to-date high of 9 million. On the same day, the number of unique transactions completed on Ethereum totaled 1.1 million.\n\nIn a post on X, research firm Delphi Digital referred to this as the \u201cflippening.\u201d According to Delphi Digital, the surge in the daily user activity on Toncoin over Ethereum has been \u201cfueled by Telegram\u2019s 900M user base.\u201d\n\nTON puts holders in profit\n\nAt press time, TON exchanged hands at $7.65. After plunging to a two-month low of $6.76 on 11th June, the token\u2019s price rebounded and has since surged by 11%.\n\nTON has seen considerable trading activity in the past 24 hours. Totaling $491 million as of this writing, the altcoin\u2019s trading volume during the period has increased by over 100%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe 9% price spike witnessed in the last 24 hours has led many of TON\u2019s holders to record profits.\n\nAMBCrypto assessed the altcoin\u2019s daily ratio of transaction volume in profit to loss. At press time, the metric\u2019s value was 14.22, the highest level since February.\n\nThis suggested that for every TON transaction that has ended in a loss, 14.22 transactions brought about a profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Toncoin [TON] Profit Calculator\n\nFurther, the token\u2019s weighted sentiment was positive at press time, as revealed by data from Santiment. This marked the first time TON had recorded a positive weighted sentiment since the beginning of June.\n\nAs of this writing, the altcoin\u2019s weighted sentiment was 0.75, suggesting that the discussions around TON on social media platforms are predominantly positive."

        "content": "SOL and ETH had the highest gains in the market increase in May.\n\nThe assets have declined significantly in the last 24 hours.\n\nAn analysis of a recently released market report showed that Ethereum [ETH] and Solana [SOL] had the highest increases in May. This surge was influenced by the ETF spot approval for ETH and the rumored proposal of a SOL spot ETF.\n\nSolana, Ethereum lead gainers chart\n\nAccording to a report released by Crypto Rank, the market experienced moderate growth in May and was not overwhelmingly bullish.\n\nHowever, Ethereum and Solana saw significant price increases despite the slow trend.\n\nThe data showed that SOL had a 30.1% increase, while ETH increased by 24.68%.\n\nThe chart indicated that these assets were the highest gainers, contributing to shifting market sentiment from neutral to positive.\n\nWhat influenced the Solana, Ethereum price gain\n\nThe primary catalyst for the Ethereum price increase was the approval of its spot ETF. Traders view this approval as a source of extra liquidity entering the market.\n\nAdditionally, the approval is expected to raise the demand for ETH, positively impacting its price. Although trading has yet to commence, the news has boosted positive sentiment.\n\nMoreover, Solana is seen as one of the main competitors to Ethereum. When the ETH spot ETF approval was announced, rumors started circulating about a SOL spot ETF being next.\n\nAlthough no proposal has been submitted to date, the positive sentiment has continued and is reflected in the price trend.\n\nHow SOL and ETH have trended\n\nAn analysis of Solana\u2019s price trend on a daily time frame showed that it started May with consecutive uptrends. Although it experienced some declines towards the month\u2019s end, it finished higher than where it started.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis, Solana\u2019s price was around $134.54 at the end of 1st May, after an increase of over 6%. It closed the month with a decline of around 0.8% but was trading at approximately $165.58.\n\nAs of this writing, Solana was trading at around $153, having declined by over 3%. It was now trading below its short moving average (yellow line), which had previously served as support.\n\nThis trend was the opposite of how it started the previous month.\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price trend showed that it started May with a decline of over 1%, trading at around $2,970.\n\nThe rest of the month was relatively uneventful until 20th May, when its value increased by 19.23%, taking its price to over $3,600.\n\nBy the end of the month, ETH was trading at around $3,760.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAs of this writing, ETH was trading at around $3,519, experiencing a decline of over 4%. Similar to Solana, it has seen significant declines in June.\n\nHowever, it remained above its short moving average (yellow line), which continued to serve as support around the $3,300 price level."

According to CoinMarketCap data, the value of the leading altcoin has cratered by almost 10% in the last week.\n\nThis price fall is attributable to the drop in new demand for the altcoin. At the time of writing, its key momentum indicators rested below their respective center lines, confirming the spike in selling pressure.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 45.40, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) was 45.69. These indicators measure the momentum and strength of an asset\u2019s price movements.\n\nAt these values, they suggest that market participants favored ETH sell-offs over accumulating new coins.\n\nETH\u2019s dwindling Chaikin Money Flow confirmed this trend. As of this writing, the coin\u2019s CMF was in a downtrend and below the zero line at -0.01.\n\nThe indicator tracks how money flows in and out of an asset\u2019s market. A negative CMF value is a sign of market weakness. It suggests capital outflow and indicates a bearish bias toward an asset.\n\nFurther, the negative values of ETH\u2019s Elder-Ray Index confirmed the bearish bias toward the altcoin. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nWhen its value is negative like this, bear power is dominant in the market.\n\nAs of this writing, the value of ETH\u2019s Elder-Ray Index was -209.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIf ETH\u2019s selling momentum mounts, its price may drop below the $3500 territory to exchange hands at $3403.\n\nIf invalidated and bullish sentiment returns to the market, ETH\u2019s price might rally toward $3610."

        "content": "Payment platform, PayPal, has unleashed its US-backed cryptocurrency stablecoin on an additional blockchain as it seeks to grow its market share within the stablecoin market.\n\nThe payment processing giant originally unveiled its PYUSD stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain but added it to the Solana blockchain as of May 29, 2024.\n\nAs of now, Nigerians with cryptocurrency wallets can purchase PYUSD on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains. PayPal has taken the agile decision to launch PYUSD on a second blockchain due to a string of beneficial features offered by Solana.\n\nAll of which align with PayPal\u2019s commitment to fast, versatile, and secure user experiences.\n\nHow does the Solana blockchain differ from Ethereum?\n\nThose unfamiliar with the Solana blockchain will be interested to know that the Solana blockchain can process as many as 65,000 transactions every second, with transactions costing only $0.0025.\n\nThis is a stark contrast with Ethereum, where only 15 transactions can be handled every second, with fees costing anything from $1 to $50.\n\nPayPal has a proud track record when it comes to providing swift, cost-effective transactions for businesses and consumers worldwide. Whether it\u2019s purchasing goods and services from e-commerce platforms or facilitating instant cashouts to give iGaming players faster access to online casino winnings, this e-wallet has successfully established itself as a credible alternative to paying with debit cards and potentially exposing sensitive bank account details online.\n\nJose Fernandez da Ponte, senior vice president of blockchain at PayPal, issued a statement about PayPal\u2019s decision to expand its stablecoin onto the Solana blockchain. Da Ponte said the move will fast-track its aim of establishing a legitimate cryptocurrency of stable value for use in the world of e-commerce and other digital payments.\n\nThe Solana blockchain has shot to prominence in the last couple of years, cementing itself as a credible, next-generation version of the Ethereum blockchain. According to data from crypto analytics firm, Artemis, Solana handled stablecoins to the tune of $1.5 trillion in the last 12 months \u2013 almost twice the $885 billion handled on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSolana\u2019s rise hasn\u2019t been without its challenges though. There have been instances of network outages, when the blockchain was inaccessible for as long as five hours in February. At the time of writing, Solana\u2019s team are working to release an update for its platform to improve its uptime and general stability.\n\nMore about PYUSD and stablecoins in general\n\nPayPal\u2019s original PYUSD stablecoin was launched in August last year on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. Every PYUSD token is backed by fiat US dollar deposits, as well as short-term treasury and cash equivalents.\n\nPYUSD is bidding to keep pace with the two alternative stablecoins in the crypto space right now. Tether USDT is comfortably the most used US dollar-backed stablecoin, with many Nigerians using this to gain crypto-based exposure to the US fiat currency. Almost three-quarters (70%) of all stablecoin transactions are made using USDT right now.\n\nTether\u2019s market cap is approximately $111 billion, while PYUSD currently stands are around $273 million. All of which suggests PYUSD has plenty of work to do, but a switch to Solana could accelerate those bold ambitions."

However, ETH failed to settle above the $3,650 level and started another decline. There was a steady decline below the $3,580 level, like Bitcoin.\n\nThe price declined below the $3,550 support level. There was a move below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,431 swing low to the $3,655 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,610 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $3,580 level.\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,600 level and the trend line. An upside break above the $3,600 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,650, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,720 level.\n\nA clear move above the $3,720 level might call for a test of the $3,800 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,880 resistance zone.\n\nMore Downsides In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,600 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $3,480 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,431 swing low to the $3,655 high. The next major support is near the $3,420 zone.\n\nA clear move below the $3,420 support might push the price toward $3,320. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $3,420\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,600"
