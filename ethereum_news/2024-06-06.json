        "title": "Brief History of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, UK, June 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche curiosity into a mainstream financial phenomenon, transforming how we think about money, technology, and business. It began with the introduction of Bitcoin, a digital currency that promised a decentralized, secure, and immutable way to transfer value across the globe. Bitcoin's success paved the way for Ethereum, a platform that expanded the potential of blockchain technology with its smart contracts and decentralized applications. As the crypto landscape continued to evolve, new innovations like the BlockDAG Network emerged, offering scalable and efficient alternatives to traditional blockchain architectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article explores the fascinating history of cryptocurrency, from the inception of Bitcoin to the rise of Ethereum and the cutting-edge developments in BlockDAG Network, providing a comprehensive overview of the journey and the impact these technologies have had on the world.\n\nBitcoin: The Genesis of Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin, often hailed as digital gold, revolutionized the financial world as the first decentralized cryptocurrency. The brainchild of a pseudonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's white paper was released on October 28, 2008. The document introduced a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, enabling digital value transfer between parties without intermediaries like banks. This system utilized a blockchain, a chain of transactions stored on multiple computers competing to process and store transactions. This process, known as mining, created new Bitcoin BTC tokens and ensured the network's security and decentralization.\n\nThe first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. At the time, 10,000 BTC was worth $41. As Bitcoin's value surged over the years, reaching peaks like $70,000 in March 2024, this transaction became a legendary story in the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin's journey from a cryptographic novelty to a multi-trillion-dollar asset involved overcoming significant challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and security breaches. However, its decentralized, immutable, and divisible nature made it a revolutionary global financial instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum: Beyond Currency to Decentralized Applications\n\nWhile Bitcoin laid the foundation, Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain technology. Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced a decentralized platform for running smart contracts. These contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum's unique feature is its Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that run exactly as programmed without downtime, fraud, or third-party interference. This innovation opened the door to numerous applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network by compensating miners for computational work and transaction validation. Despite facing volatility and security challenges, Ethereum has solidified its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockDAG Network: The Next Evolution in Blockchain Technology\n\nThe traditional blockchain architecture, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, operates on a linear sequence of blocks. While effective, this model faces scalability issues, particularly with increasing transaction volumes. Enter BlockDAG Network , a novel approach that aims to address these limitations.\n\nBlockDAG has attracted investor\u2019s attention and capital as a decentralized network structure where transactions are arranged in a graph format rather than a linear chain. This architecture allows multiple blocks to be processed simultaneously, significantly enhancing transaction throughput and scalability. Key characteristics of BlockDAG networks include parallel transactions, enhanced scalability, and improved security.\n\nNow BlockDAG Network has attracted even more attention within the industry with the release of its second keynote video, humorously titled \u201cFrom the Moon.\u201d\n\nThe project's presale has amassed over $40 million in record time for any cryptocurrency or digital asset initiative. This impressive funding surge underscores the rising interest in BlockDAG Network as a new store of value and passive income generator, akin to Bitcoin.\n\nThe momentum behind BlockDAG Network suggests that the $40 million raised is merely the beginning of what is poised to be a groundbreaking force in the digital market.\n\nThe Evolution of Crypto Assets and Market Dynamics\n\nBitcoin's brief surpassing of $70,000 on Monday marked a peak amidst a fourth consecutive week of inflows into crypto investment products. CoinShares International Ltd. reported $185 million in inflows for the week ending May 31, with $2 billion invested in May alone. This surge underscored the growing institutional interest and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum, characterized by its volatility, continues to evolve with significant developments like the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to address scalability and energy efficiency through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nThe journey from Bitcoin to Ethereum and BlockDAG Network illustrates the rapid evolution and diversification of cryptocurrency technologies. From enabling peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized applications to enhancing scalability and security, these innovations are reshaping the financial landscape.\n\nThe digital evolution promises not only to disrupt traditional financial systems but also to democratize access to financial services, empowering users worldwide.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\n\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\n\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Should Ethereum Layer 2s Urgently Decentralize Their Sequencers? - Unchained",
        "content": "After Layer 2 network Linea halted block production this week, many demanded the sequencers be decentralized. But is it necessary?\n\nThe recent temporary halt of block production on Consensys\u2019 Linea network following a $6.8 million exploit on the Velocore DEX, has renewed the debate about decentralizing sequencers in Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Amidst this, on Wednesday, Optimism passed a proposal to implement fraud proofs. Although this wouldn\u2019t help decentralize the sequencer, it would propel the blockchain to what\u2019s referred to as \u201cStage 1\u201d decentralization on layer 2s.\n\nSequencers\n\nin layer 2 solutions are entities that order and batch transactions before submitting them to the layer 1 blockchain, enabling more transactions per second at a lower cost. However, the centralization of these sequencers has raised concerns about security and censorship.\n\nLearn more: What Are Sequencers in Layer 2 Protocols?\n\nSteven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, which develops Ethereum\u2019s top L2, Arbitrum, told Unchained that it\u2019s important to properly contextualize when discussing sequencers: \u201cThe term \u2018sequencer\u2019 means different things in different protocols.\u201d The sequencer\u2019s role is to order transactions, thus the definition. While this centralized component allows for faster transaction processing, it could censor by delaying transactions, though it cannot alter account balances or post illegitimate transactions. This safeguard is ensured by a network of validators that can challenge any incorrect actions via a fraud-proof mechanism.\n\nTherefore, according to Goldfeder, while the sequencer is centralized, the validation process is not, involving entities like Offchain Labs, Consensys, and even Google. However, Goldfeder highlighted that the \u201choly grail\u201d is that everyone can validate. To achieve that, in the next couple weeks, they expect to roll out Arbitrum Bold, a new protocol for managing disputes on Arbitrum chains that enables permissionless validation. Goldfeder suggests that while decentralizing sequencers is an important problem, it is a \u201cbit smaller than what a lot of people might expect.\u201d\n\nChristine Kim, VP of research at Galaxy Digital, believes that decentralization is a spectrum and that fault-proof mechanisms alone do not ensure decentralization. \u201cRollups in general are significantly less decentralized and secure than the base layer, Ethereum.\u201d However, she thinks that having a working fault-proof mechanism does not mean that a rollup is more decentralized than another because \u201cworking fault proofs is not the only mechanism that rollups need to achieve higher levels of decentralization and resiliency,\u201d she told Unchained via email.\n\nHaseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly, concurs, noting that while Arbitrum has fault proofs, they are currently whitelist-only. \u201cThe important thing about sequencers is not decentralizing so much as making the sequencers more robust. That almost certainly comes first,\u201d he told Unchained.\n\nEven though fault proofs are not the only measure of decentralization for L2s, of the top five L2s by TVL, only Arbitrum has a fraud system in place. Optimism, Base, Blast and Mantle, currently lack fraud-proof mechanisms, meaning their sequencers have more power over transaction outcomes. \u201cBasically they have a dictator,\u201d said Goldfeder.\n\n\u201cWe need fault proofs on OP Stack, and then we need fault proofs to be reliable enough that anybody should be able to submit them, and move away from security councils and multisigs,\u201d Qureshi said.\n\nKim argues that while optimistic rollups should work towards decentralizing their sequencers, they must also build working fault proofs, robust governance mechanisms, reduce reliance on admin controls, lower fees, and improve interoperability with other rollups. \u201cA decentralized sequencer may be one of the hardest initiatives for a rollup to work towards but certainly not the only important one in the near-term to improve a rollup\u2019s decentralization and resiliency,\u201d she added.\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

        "content": "According to a recent update from Whale Alert, a dormant pre-mine address containing roughly $21.9 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has sprung back to life for the first time in nearly nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the first pre-mine Ethereum address that has been activated this June so far. In May, two such addresses containing $325,535 and $5.9 million, respectively, experienced sudden awakenings.\n\nIn April, only one address that was created before the launch of the genesis block was activated. For comparison, three such cases were recorded in March. In February, as many as five pre-mined addresses sprung back to life after years of inactivity. In January, there were two newly activated addresses from the pre-mine era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum organized a major sale back in 2014, making it possible to buy pre-mined tokens that were created before the network's launch.\n\nEthereum plunges\n\nThe most activation came after the Ether price slipped to an intraday low of $3,642 earlier this Friday, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe cryptocurrency took a nosedive after the most recent US jobs report greatly exceeded analysts' expectations. The persistent refusal of America's labor market to cool down does not bode well for those who are desperately waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting rates. The odds of a rate cut in 2024 have dropped substantially following the release of the blowout jobs data.\n\nNearly $49 million worth of Ether positions has been liquidated over the past four hours alone, with longs accounting for nearly 93% of the sum."

        "title": "Hard Fork: What It Is in Blockchain, How It Works, and Why It Happens - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Hard Fork?\n\nA blockchain hard fork is a change in programming that is incompatible with the old programming. This essentially creates a new blockchain and cryptocurrency. Hard forks generally require all nodes or users who wish to stay on the new chain to upgrade to the latest version of the software.\n\nHard forks may be initiated by developers as part of routine progress or maintenance on a blockchain. They may also be created by a faction of the crypto community that wants to take a different direction with the blockchain.\n\nKey Takeaways A hard fork is an event in which a change to a blockchain results in two branches: one that follows previous protocols and one that follows the new version.\n\nIn a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will also be granted tokens in the new fork, but participants must choose which blockchain to continue verifying.\n\nHard forks are not specific to any single blockchain\u2014it is an event that many have gone through.\n\nHard forks occur for several reasons, such as developer disagreements, required updates to a blockchain, or someone attempting to make another blockchain and cryptocurrency they control.\n\nHow Hard Forks Work\n\nA hard fork is when a new blockchain version emerges that is incompatible with the original version. It is not always an adverse event; in fact, many blockchains have undergone hard forks to implement necessary changes.\n\n\n\nBlockchains are basically programs that create and store files of information on a network of computers and devices. There are usually layers of software completing different tasks, some methods for the network to reach an agreement on the blockchain's state, and many network participants. Each layer's underlying programming can be changed as needed, but it has to be accepted by the network's participants to be adopted.\n\nDevelopers cannot force changes on a public blockchain that relies on participation. Public blockchains rely on their participants, so changes must be implemented by them, not forced upon them. Otherwise, they can refuse to accept the changes and keep their preferred version.\n\nBecause blockchains are essentially programs and scripts, they can be affected by errors, bugs, network communication problems, hardware failures, or other issues. Blockchains also rely on a large number of network participants to host versions for security.\n\nWhen developers publish a change to any of a blockchain's functions, one of two things happen: a hard fork or a soft fork. If the change is drastic enough to prevent a participant running the old version from participating in the blockchain's processes, the change is considered to have created a hard fork in the blockchain. Conversely, a change that allows old and new nodes to run is considered a soft fork.\n\nIn a hard fork event, participants are faced with a choice\u2014they can update their software to the new version or not upgrade their software and use the old (and now unmaintained) blockchain.\n\n\n\nImage by Julie Bang \u00a9 Investopedia 2019\n\nReasons for a Hard Fork\n\nThere are several reasons or even events that cause developers to implement a hard fork. For instance, when the hack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) occurred, the Ethereum blockchain was forked by a nearly unanimous vote.\n\nThe fork rolled back transactions that siphoned off tens of millions of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork also helped DAO token holders get their ether (ETH) funds returned. However, some miners kept mining the old chain, which was picked up by OTC desks and given a price discovery order book. Poloniex listed this currency also, and some of the Ethereum community decided to keep this version and created Ethereum Classic.\n\nWhat Is the Meaning of Hard Fork? A hard fork is a change in a blockchain's programming that creates a new blockchain and cryptocurrency. Many projects have hard forked but kept their original names and tokens, with other groups deciding to stay with the original code and change the name.\n\nIs a Hard Fork Good or Bad? It depends on the circumstances and participants' views. Some might believe a hard fork is necessary and good, while others might not.\n\nWhy Do Hard Forks Happen? There are several reasons a hard fork might happen. Code might need adjusting to fix errors or address a weakness, or a group might want to create their own blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHard forks are a change in programming that results in a blockchain split. Sometimes, hard forks are controversial in the community involved in a blockchain; at other times, they are necessary for a blockchain to progress.\n\nIn situations with controversy, participants and users can either upload the updated blockchain and begin processing it or reject it and use the old chain. This is how several blockchains and cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic, started.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "ARK Invest won\u2019t issue a spot Ethereum ETF alongside 21Shares.\n\nThe two firms\u2019 Bitcoin ETF is a top performer.\n\nARK could be hesitant because of the price tag \u2014 or waiting for the SEC to approve staking.\n\nAlmost a dozen firms are competing to launch spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds. But crypto heavyweight ARK Invest isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\u201cARK believes in its transformative potential and the long-term value of the Ethereum blockchain, but, at this time, ARK will not be moving forward with an Ethereum ETF,\u201d an ARK spokesperson told DL News.\n\nARK Invest issued a spot Bitcoin ETF in January alongside 21Shares, a firm that specialises in launching crypto investment products. And the two firms seemed ready for another round, filing for an Ethereum ETF jointly.\n\nNo surprise there: The massive success of the Bitcoin ETFs suggests Ethereum ETFs could quickly accumulate billions of dollars in assets with even a fraction of the demand.\n\nBut a recent filing showed that ARK has dropped out of the partnership and that 21Shares will pursue a spot Ethereum ETF on its own.\n\nExpensive products\n\nThere are a couple reasons why ARK may have changed its mind.\n\nFor one, launching an ETF is expensive \u2014 and in the case of the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the fees are so low that issuers don\u2019t always make a profit.\n\n\u201cAlthough Bitcoin ETFs have done well in terms of assets, the issuers face profitability challenges due to fee compression and the relatively high costs of the crypto-related fund service providers,\u201d Will Cai, managing director of indices of Kaiko, a crypto data and research firm, told DL News.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nARK and 21Shares\u2019 Bitcoin ETF is one of the most successful funds out of the 10 that launched in January. Coming in third behind BlackRock and Fidelity, it has vacuumed up almost $3.5 billion in assets in five months \u2014 an impressive performance by normal ETF standards.\n\nEven so, with fees at 0.21%, it may be hard for ARK and 21Shares to break even on the product. They still must pay their Bitcoin custodian \u2014 in this case, Coinbase \u2014 as well as administrative fees, their cash custodian, and other things like transfer agents.\n\n\u201cThis could well put pressure on the terms of the partnership when there isn\u2019t much profit to go around,\u201d Cai said.\n\nWaiting for staking\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that ARK is waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission to greenlight spot Ethereum ETFs that also provide staking services.\n\n\u201cWe will continue evaluating efficient ways to provide our investors with exposure to this innovative technology in a way that unlocks its full benefits,\u201d the ARK spokesperson told DL News.\n\nIn their current design, the ETFs will provide pure exposure only to Ether\u2019s price, without the roughly 3% yield that investors can earn by staking their Ether.\n\nIn other words, not only will investors have to pay a fee to ETF issuers for the exposure to Ether, they will be missing out on opportunities to grow their holdings in Ether terms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one massive idiosyncratic factor with ETH that will affect demand and that\u2019s staking,\u201d Adam Morgan McCarthy, a Kaiko analyst, told DL News.\n\n\u201cEven paying 0.20% fees without the staking element seems like a nonstarter to me,\u201d he added.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

If the leading altcoin continues its stronghold among smart contract platforms, a credible path to $66 billion in free cash flow to token holders supports a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nEthereum: VanEck Sees $4T Settled and $66B in Free Cash Flows\n\nWith around 20 million monthly active users, the Ethereum network has settled $4 trillion in value and facilitated $5.5 trillion in stablecoin transfers over the last twelve months. VanEck\u2019s 2030 valuation of ETH is based on a forecast of $66 billion in free cash flows generated and accruing to the ETH token, with an estimated 33x valuation multiple on those cash flows.\n\nVanEck's Ethereum Prediction: $2.2T Asset by 2030 3\n\nThe analysis begins by estimating the market size of business sectors that blockchain applications will disrupt, leading to a total addressable market (TAM) of $15 trillion.\n\nWe project ETH\u2019s 2030 valuation based upon a forecast of $66B in free cashflows generated by Ethereum and accruing to the ETH token. We estimate 33x valuation multiple on those cashflows. As Ethereum is a platform for applications, we begin our valuation by estimating the market size of business sectors that blockchain applications will disrupt. We estimate the total addressable market (TAM) to be $15T based on annual revenues in these industry verticals\n\nAs Ethereum evolves and expands its applications, the model incorporates increased ETH supply burn, greater market capture, and higher take rates on economic activities. These changes reflect the network\u2019s growing fundamentals, recent innovations, and shifting regulatory landscape in the U.S."

        "content": "Hong Kong asset management regulators may approve the integration of staking into their spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, according to Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu. This move would allow these ETFs to include staking incentives.\n\nYat Siu said in an interview that Hong Kong is currently discussing staking and that the chance of staking being legalized in Asia before the United States is nearly certain.\n\n\u201cIn terms of how quickly, there\u2019s an optimistic side of me that wants it to happen within the year,\u201d said Siu. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get much movement on staking within the year, then I would say the election outcome will be the other determinant in terms of how quickly that could happen in the U.S.\u201d\n\nHashKey, which manages bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong alongside Bosera, intends to implement ether staking. CEO Livio Weng indicated that the approach attempts to gain rewards without increasing risks, with additional information to follow.\n\nWeng stated that they hope to move forward with some studies in this area [of ether staking] in a compliant and controlled manner without increasing risks.\n\nBlockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure provider, is also in talks with Hong Kong ETF issuers and custodians about delivering ETF staking services, according to Glenn Woo, Blockdaemon\u2019s APAC head of sales.\n\nBlockdaemon is in discussions with Hong Kong ETF issuers and custodians to offer staking services, according to Glenn Woo, head of sales for APAC.

        "title": "Bitcoin set for new all-time high next week but Ethereum holds it back \u2013 10x Research - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Crypto research firm 10x Research has warned that a sharp decline in Ethereum prices could prevent Bitcoin from reaching a sustainable new all-time high of over $83,000, according to a June 7 analysis shared with CryptoSlate.\n\nDuring the past week, ETH\u2019s price has considerably struggled compared to Bitcoin\u2019s price. The second-largest digital asset fell by around 1.2% during the period, while BTC\u2019s price rose by more than 3%. While not explicitly explained in the note, 10x Research believes Ethereum could hold Bitcoin back from a sentiment perspective.\n\n10x Research, citing Ethereum\u2019s future position, noted that traders were more willing to punt on BTC. Additionally, the firm predicted that demand for ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would fall short of expectations.\n\nIt stated:\n\n\u201cPositioning in Ether futures is already stretched, and as SEC Gary Gensler said this week, it might take a while until those (S-1) ETH ETFs are approved. Futures positioning increase in ETH has lagged this week at $0.3 billion as traders prefer to buy Bitcoin exposure at this point, [recording] $2.2 billion. The numbers speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nHow BTC can reach new ATH\n\nMeanwhile, the firm believes Bitcoin may hit a new all-time high of $83,000 soon if it breaks a key technical pattern as early as today, June 7, or by Wednesday, June 12.\n\nMarkus Thielen, the CEO of 10x Research, said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time until Bitcoin hits a new all-time high. The head-and-shoulders formation indicates a rally toward $83,000 soon, with the resistance line likely breaking within the next few days.\u201d\n\nThe firm attributed its bullish outlook to recent global economic activities, including interest rate cuts in Canada, Denmark, and Europe. The prediction also considers a weaker US employment market and a potential decline in inflation as factors supporting the new ATH.\n\n10x Research further explained that it typically takes about $800 million or $8 billion in inflows to increase Bitcoin\u2019s price by 1% and 10%, respectively. These inflows come from various sectors, including Bitcoin ETFs, which recently accounted for 35% of total Bitcoin flow.\n\nSo, to achieve a weekly Bitcoin rally of 5%, the market would need $4.2 billion in inflows, with Bitcoin Spot ETFs seeing $1.7 billion. However, to reach its projected new all-time high of $83,000, 10x Research expects Bitcoin to require over $13 billion in inflows across all sectors. It added:\n\n\u201cA breakout above the $71,600 trend line will naturally result in more upside buying through multiple products, but $13 billion [in inflows] requires quite some commitment. Nevertheless, we think this is possible as a weaker US employment market (unemployment rate at 4.0%) and lower inflation data next week (3.3%) will likely provide the macro backdrop for new all-time highs.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The Base ecosystem, incubated within Coinbase, is a Layer-2 solution designed to make the Ethereum blockchain more scalable, reduce transaction costs, and improve dApp user experiences.\n\nDespite ties to a centralized exchange, the project aims for progressive decentralization, which is critical for an open cryptoeconomy. Built on the OP Stack, Base ensures security, stability, and scalability for on-chain apps.\n\nLaunched in August 2023, Base has become one of the fastest-growing Layer-2 networks with nearly $2 billion in total value locked.\n\nNote: Base currently has no plans to introduce a new token; it uses ETH as its gas token. Be wary of potential scams offering fake Base tokens.\n\nThe following Base guide explores the ecosystem\u2019s growth metrics & potential, leading projects, and a step-by-step guide to use it.\n\nAbout the Base Ecosystem: The Vibe\n\nBase significantly benefits from its integration with Coinbase\u2019s large user base, which has helped usher in rapid user adoption and project integration.\n\nCoinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in North America with nearly 100 million users. The integration with Base has enabled seamless fiat onramps and access to a large user base.\n\nBase operates as a decentralized network, and Coinbase does not intervene in its daily operations. While Coinbase supports the ecosystem, Base maintains its decentralized nature by operating independently, utilizing the OP Stack for scalability and security.\n\nThe benefits of the Base blockchain for developers are numerous. Beyond financial investments, the Base ecosystem fund frequently offers developer grants and organizes hackathons. So far, it has invested in projects like:\n\nAvanti, an oracle-based synthetic derivatives protocol, that allows users to trade crypto and real-world assets with up to 100x leverage and earn yield as a market-maker by providing USDC liquidity.\n\nBSX, a decentralized limit order book, that combines the best of CeFi and DeFi trading experiences, offering features like cross-collateralization, powerful cross-margining, and self-custody.\n\nOnboard , a project that provides an onchain, self-custodial path for users to onramp and offramp crypto in a peer-to-peer manner through their own MPC wallet and smart contracts, focusing on developing markets.\n\nOpenCover, t he first Layer 2 insurance aggregator that works with underwriters to protect DeFi users against onchain risks such as smart contract hacks and oracle failures.\n\nt Paragraph, an onchain creator platform that helps creators publish, share, and monetize their content using permissionless protocols, enabling novel onchain mechanisms like turning posts into collectibles.\n\nTruflation, an onchain financial oracle providing automated, independent daily inflation reporting by compiling data from millions of points and sources, offering a higher fidelity picture of inflation.\n\nBase\u2019s Coinbase link gets its foot in the door with potential partnerships with institutional investors, enterprises, and developer communities. These partnerships could lead to larger-scale projects and collaborations that drive substantial value for the ecosystem.\n\nAbout Base Ecosystem: The Numbers\n\nBase saw its first notable spurt of activity and TVL in September 2023, but its most significant in Q2 2024.\n\nBase\u2019s blockchain total value locked in 2024 is nearly $2 billion as of writing.\n\nBase saw its daily transactions jump from 500,000 in March 2024 to over 3 million in April 2024.\n\nAround the same time, Base broke the $1 billion in total value bridged and currently has about $2.1 trillion of total value bridged, with ETH taking the lion\u2019s share.\n\nBy April 2024, Base had over 400,000 sign-ups and a cumulative trading volume surpassing $1 billion, driven by a memecoin frenzy.\n\nBase Explorer is the recommended chain explorer.\n\nAbout Base: The Tech\n\nBase, like other \u201coptimistic rollups,\u201d assumes transactions are valid initially, reducing computational overhead. Suspicious transactions undergo fraud-proof verification, maintaining low costs.\n\nDefinition: optimistic rollup (noun)\u2013 Transactions are initially assumed to be valid, hence \u201coptimistic,\u201d and are later validated on-chain. A fraud-proof mechanism is triggered to verify its validity if any transaction is suspected to be fraudulent. This allows for significant scalability and efficiency improvements while leveraging the underlying blockchain\u2019s security. Several other blockchain projects also utilize optimistic rollups for scaling, including the pioneering Optimism, Arbitrum, and Boba Network.\n\nBase is designed to seamlessly integrate with Ethereum L1, Coinbase, and other chains. Base offers cost-effective EVM features, developer-friendly APIs, and smart contract wallets. As the second core dev team on the OP Stack, Base collaborates with OP Labs to build a robust, interoperable web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe Base RPC Endpoint is here: https://mainnet.base.org.\n\nNetwork information can be found here: https://docs.base.org/docs/network-information\n\nBase is a decentralized Ethereum scaling solution, helping boost transaction speed and reduce costs.\n\nUnlike traditional Layer-1 blockchains (like Ethereum), which handle transactions individually, Base consolidates them into batches, processing them more efficiently and economically before recording them on Ethereum.\n\nHow to Use Base\n\nUsing Base, or any Layer-2, requires jumping through a few hoops. Basically, you\u2019re going to move funds from the Ethereum base layer onto Layer-2.\n\nStep 1 Choose your Wallet: Use MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStep 2: Change/Add Network (top left corner)\n\nYou\u2019ll probably see Base pop up, but just make sure it matches the below criteria:\n\nRPC Endpoint: https://mainnet.base.org`\n\nChain ID: 8453\n\nCurrency Symbol: ETH\n\nStep 3 Bridge ETH: Bridge ETH from Ethereum or other EVM chains to Base once connected.\n\nDefinition: Bridge (noun, verb) \u2013 transferring assets, like ETH, from one blockchain network to another. This involves moving your cryptocurrency from its original network (e.g., Ethereum) to a new network (e.g., Base) so you can use it within the new ecosystem. The bridge ensures that the value of your assets remains intact while allowing them to be utilized on different blockchain networks.\n\n\ud83d\udca9Note: While the gas fees are significantly lower on Base, you still have to pay ETH\u2019s Layer-1 fees to bridge funds.\n\nBlock Explorer: Https://basescan.org\n\nFor more details, visit https://www.base.org.\n\nMost Popular Base Projects\n\nDeFi\n\nThe most active (based on unique active wallets) dApps in the Base ecosystem are decentralized exchanges like Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2, 1inch Network, SushiSwap V3, and Compound.\n\nAerodrome, a next-generation AMM designed to serve as Base\u2019s central liquidity hub, is a stand-out infrastructure in the Base ecosystem.\n\nMemecoins\n\nMemecoins such as TOSHI, TYBG, NORMIE, and BRETT drive significant trading volumes and transactional activity on Base.\n\nAs of writing, the $BRETT memecoin is having its moment in the sun.\n\nOther Base Ecosystem dApps\n\nDmail Network is a social messaging platform offering email and marketing services; Dmail Network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient communication within the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nParallel is a popular trading card game that integrates social elements.\n\nFrens On Chain is a unique digital pet project featuring dynamic NFTs.\n\nFinal Thoughts: From Coinbase to Base\n\nThe Base ecosystem, while backed by Coinbase, is designed to be a cornerstone for the decentralized future of blockchain technology.\n\nCoinbase is already credited with advancing and advocating cryptocurrency adoption to a mainstream audience, and its contributions have undoubtedly helped shape the United States policy toward cryptocurrency.\n\nBase, a decentralized Layer-2, is an exciting move from the organization and one of its first forays with direct entrepreneurship and incubation in the Ethereum ecosystem. It also launched the USDC stablecoin, an ERC-20, through CENTRE, a Coinbase-founded organization, and in collaboration with Circle.\n\nMuch of the Base hype revolves around memecoins\u2013 similar to how Solana\u2019s ecosystem received a significant pump in activity and TVL in Q1 2024. However, given its growth within the Coinbase ecosystem and beyond, the project\u2019s potential shouldn\u2019t be overlooked."

        "content": "Michael Saylor Changes Tone On Ethereum (ETH): Will Saylor Buy Ethereum ETFs?\n\nMichael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, has been a strong proponent of Bitcoin, frequently discussing its benefits across various platforms. MicroStrategy owns more than 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply and Saylor's personal holdings. Despite his focus on Bitcoin, Saylor recently began speaking about Ethereum.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true .\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nSaylor appeared on the \"What Bitcoin Did\" podcast at the end of May to discuss his views on Bitcoin and crypto. \"Bitcoin was going to be the only asset securitized and offered as a spot ETF by the Wall Street establishment\u2014and it was going to spread as the one legitimate crypto asset,\" Saylor noted.\n\nSaylor was alluding to the recent advancement of spot Ethereum ETFs to the next approval stage, which occurred just days before the interview. Although the outlook for approval was initially bleak for much of 2024, the SEC is now taking a closer look at each application. Speculation suggests that trading could begin by the end of the summer.\n\nThe advancement of the Ethereum ETFs surprised everyone, including Saylor. Previously, Saylor believed that Bitcoin was the only crypto asset worthy of investment, with other cryptocurrencies merely imitating Bitcoin's success. However, the approval of the ETFs arguably legitimizes Ethereum in the eyes of institutional investors.\n\nTrending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nFor years, Saylor has focused on Bitcoin's limited supply and its use of blockchain for transactions. However, during the interview, he acknowledged the advantages of Ethereum, noting that \u2018digital art, NFTs, tokens,...DeFi' are all part of \u2018an entire range of use cases' for crypto.\n\nDespite recognizing Ethereum's benefits, Saylor still believes Bitcoin will remain the leader in crypto. He noted that institutional investors might \u2018allocate 5% or 10% to the crypto asset class, but Bitcoin will be 60% to 70% of that.' The Ethereum ETFs could attract new crypto investors who will also buy Bitcoin.\n\nThis raises the question of whether Saylor will invest in the Ethereum ETFs. Based on his interview comments, his top crypto choice remains Bitcoin. While he acknowledges some benefits of Ethereum and other tokens, he believes these benefits will attract more people to Bitcoin. \"I think that we are politically much more powerful [when] supported by the entire crypto industry,\" he said. Given this perspective, it seems unlikely that Saylor will make significant investments in Ethereum ETFs, though it is not entirely out of the question.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Michael Saylor Changes Tone On Ethereum (ETH): Will Saylor Buy Ethereum ETFs? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The highly anticipated launch of Ethereum ETH/USD exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States may see a more subdued response compared to the initial excitement surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict.\n\nWhat Happened: JPMorgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, estimate that Ethereum ETFs will attract a modest $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows by the year\u2019s end, a stark contrast to the $15.3 billion garnered by Bitcoin ETFs, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 109% price increase over the past year lags behind Bitcoin\u2019s 169% surge.\n\nJames Davies, CPO and founder of Crypto Valley Exchange, told Benzinga that analysts are expecting lower demand for Ether ETH/USD as its prominence relative to Bitcoin is not as broadly known and accepted by the public.\u201d\n\nCaroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, concurred, noting, \u201cEther doesn't have the profile of Bitcoin,\u201d and emphasized Bitcoin's BTC/USD market value of $1.4 trillion, which is three times that of Ether.\n\nSEC Approval Process\n\nDavies is optimistic about the approval process under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, stating, \u201cEveryone sees that ETH ETFs will pass very soon.\u201d\n\nHe added that denial of these ETFs would likely lead to lawsuits, mirroring the legal actions seen with Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMarko Jurina, CEO of Jumper.Exchange, also expects approval, saying, \u201cChances of issuance are imminently favorable,\u201d given recent regulatory developments.\n\nLong-Term Advantages Of Ethereum ETFs\n\nDespite the expected lower demand, Ethereum ETFs offer unique benefits.\n\n\u201cETH has utility mostly not present in the Bitcoin ecosystem, so much of the overall crypto ecosystem is tied to ETH,\u201d Davies noted, suggesting significant long-term growth potential.\n\nVanEck's Head of Digital-Asset Research, Matthew Sigel, supported this view, stating, \u201cOver time, we expect investors to conclude that the potential for application and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem could be much larger than that of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: JPM - Benzinga\">JPMorgan: US Crypto Regulations Signal Opposition To CBDCs And Non-Compliant Stablecoins\n\nPotential Selling Pressure And Market Dynamics\n\nConcerns remain about selling pressure from Grayscale's planned conversion of its $11 billion Ethereum fund into an ETF.\n\nDavies warned, \u201cThe potential \u2018selling pressure\u2019 on Ether from redemptions in Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum fund could be significant.\u201d\n\nHowever, he also noted that net inflows to BTC ETFs could potentially offset this pressure.\n\nBroader Investor Sentiment\n\nEther continues to trade below its all-time high of $4,866, with global investors showing less enthusiasm compared to Bitcoin.\n\nByteTree Asset Management's Charlie Morris observed, \u201cGlobal investors have been less enthusiastic about Ether, which they have had access to through Europe and Canada for years.\u201d\n\nThe implications of these developments and broader trends in digital asset investments will be a key topic at the Benzinga Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19.\n\nIndustry leaders will provide valuable insights into how these strategic moves and regulatory changes are shaping the future of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRead Next: Is Robinhood\u2019s Crypto Exchange Deal Really \u2018Massive\u2019 And The \u2018First Domino To Fall?\u2019\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn Ethereum (ETH) whale has transferred 8,710 ETH, valued at approximately $33.55 million, to Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The transaction was highlighted by Whale Alert, a service that tracks large crypto transactions. The transfer has sparked speculation that this whale might be preparing to sell a large portion of their holdings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch moves are closely watched by the crypto community, as they can significantly impact market dynamics. Given the recent rally in Ethereum\u2019s price, it is plausible that the whale intends to capitalize on the gains. Over the last 30 days, the ETH price has surged by 22.15%, and it is currently trading at $3,849, up 1.20% in the past 24 hours.\n\nMarket context and implications\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent price performance has been robust, driven by a confluence of factors, including market optimism and broader adoption trends. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs (exchange-traded funds) has been a major catalyst. These ETFs are expected to begin trading in the coming weeks, and many analysts believe that their introduction will further fuel Ethereum\u2019s price appreciation.\n\nThe approval of these ETFs marks a significant milestone for the leading altcoin, providing traditional investors with a new avenue to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. This could potentially lead to increased demand and higher prices. Analysts are bullish on Ethereum\u2019s outlook, predicting that the price could surge as these ETFs launch and attract more institutional and retail investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhale transactions , particularly those involving large amounts of cryptocurrency being moved to exchanges, are often seen as precursors to market volatility. Historically, large sell-offs have sometimes led to short-term dips in price, but the overall upward trajectory is driven by strong fundamentals, and increasing adoption tends to mitigate long-term concerns.\n\nAs the crypto community closely monitors this whale\u2019s next moves, the broader market focus remains on the upcoming trading of Ethereum ETFs. The anticipation is high, and many believe that Ethereum is on the cusp of another significant rally. For now, Ethereum stands strong, backed by positive market sentiment and strategic developments that promise to enhance its market position even further."

        "content": "VanEck Analysts Predict Ethereum Could Reach $22,000 by 2030\n\nVanEck analysts have significantly raised their price prediction for Ethereum (ETH) to $22,000 by 2030. In a post on X, VanEck shared, \"We've raised our 2030 ETH price target to $22,000, influenced by ether ETF news, scaling progress, and our read of onchain data.\" This statement was accompanied by a link to the detailed report authored by Matthew Sigel, Patrick Bush, and Denis Zinoviev.\n\nVanEck is among several Wall Street investment managers aiming to list spot Ether ETFs, following their successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether ETFs last month, enabling investors to benefit from Ethereum's price appreciation without directly purchasing the cryptocurrency. This setup also allows ETF sponsors to earn fees as more assets flow into their funds.\n\nThe VanEck analysts expressed optimism about the approval and trading of spot Ether ETFs on U.S. stock exchanges. \"This development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians, and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs,\" they noted.\n\nVanEck's base case price target is $22,000, with more extreme bullish and bearish scenarios predicting prices of $154,000 and $360, respectively. The analysts concluded, \"We believe ETH is a revolutionary asset with few parallels in the non-crypto financial world. ETH can be thought of as 'Digital Oil' because it is consumed by engaging in activity on Ethereum.\""

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst\n\nIn late May 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved the spot Ethereum ETF applications into the next stage of deliberation, opening the door for the funds to begin trading as soon as this Summer. The approvals surprised many, as the SEC had not addressed the issue much after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. With the approvals, many are speculating on what the ETFs could look like once they begin trading. Some predict they could be wildly successful.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nMany consider net inflows a key metric for determining an ETF\u2019s success. This figure provides a strong indication of the ETF's performance and sustainability over the long term. According to market analytics and brokerage firm K33 Research, Ethereum ETFs could gain up to $4.8 billion in net inflows in the first five months after launching.\n\nThe firm made the prediction using current figures on futures-linked Ethereum ETFs and comparing them to Bitcoin products. Additionally, K33 Research believes Ethereum will begin to outperform Bitcoin and the broader crypto market after the ETFs launch. This would align with Bitcoin\u2019s performance following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs when BTC's price increased more than 60% and reached all-time highs.\n\nJ.P. Morgan also predicted the ETFs would bring in $3 billion in inflows in the first five months.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETFs have set a high bar for ETF launches. The 11 ETFs were the most successful in history, accumulating more than $12 billion in net inflows in just over two months. The funds hold over $30 billion in total inflows, netting around $15 billion after accounting for outflows from Grayscale.\n\nMany believe the Ethereum ETFs will be successful, albeit less so than the Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin is considered the safest bet among crypto investments due to its size and longevity. While Ethereum has similar characteristics, Bitcoin's greater degree of these attributes makes institutions more open to Bitcoin investments.\n\nDespite Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market, Ethereum has established itself as a solid #2 token, emphasizing decentralized finance and community-built applications. In the long run, these use cases could potentially elevate Ethereum over Bitcoin, as Ethereum may have more room to adapt to changing market conditions. However, as it stands, Ethereum is still behind Bitcoin, which is expected to be reflected in ETF trading figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum ETFs To Attract Over $4 Billion In Inflows, Says K33 Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin to $100K: How Ethereum and Furrever Token Fit into the Picture - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York City, NY, June 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement following a bold prediction from Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author of \"Rich Dad Poor Dad.\" Kiyosaki forecasts that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach $100,000 by June 2024. This bullish outlook has sparked widespread interest and speculation within the crypto community, highlighting Bitcoin's potential and drawing attention to other significant cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Furrever Token (FURR). Here's a detailed look at how these three cryptocurrencies fit into the evolving market landscape.\n\nBitcoin: The Path to $100K\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s prediction is grounded in several key factors that suggest a strong upward trajectory for Bitcoin. As of early June 2024, Bitcoin is trading near $68,500, with technical analyses indicating a symmetrical triangle pattern that could push its price to between $74,000 and $75,000. This bullish continuation pattern, coupled with a surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows and the post-halving supply dynamics, supports a potential breakout.\n\nMoreover, Kiyosaki's forecast is backed by historical trends and macroeconomic conditions. He has emphasized Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, taxation, and stock market manipulation, urging investors to trust in assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs has further fueled market optimism, attracting substantial buy-side demand and reinforcing the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nEthereum: Riding the Wave of Innovation\n\nWhile Bitcoin garners headlines with its dramatic price predictions, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market due to its versatile blockchain technology and widespread adoption. Ethereum\u2019s recent price movements and potential ETF approvals are significant developments that could impact its market performance.\n\nIn late May 2024, BlackRock updated its Form S-1 for the iShares Ethereum Trust, signaling a likely approval of Ethereum ETFs by late June. Such a development would boost investor confidence and likely lead to increased demand for ETH, mirroring the positive effects seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Ethereum\u2019s utility in decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts continues to drive its adoption, positioning it as a critical player in the crypto space.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum\u2019s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has significantly reduced its energy consumption and increased its scalability. These advancements are expected to enhance Ethereum's appeal to both institutional and retail investors, further solidifying its market position alongside Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurrever Token: A Charming New Contender\n\nAmid the buzz around Bitcoin and Ethereum, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves as an emerging meme coin with a unique proposition. Launched with the aim of creating a heart-warming crypto ecosystem centered around adorable cat imagery, Furrever Token has quickly attracted attention from investors seeking high returns and community engagement.\n\nCurrently priced at $0.000732, Furrever Token\u2019s presale has already raised over $1.2 million. The project offers a 25% bonus on new purchases until June 10, 2024, providing a compelling entry point for new investors. With its potential for up to 15X returns, Furrever Token appeals to both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Furrever Token's potential success. Its engaging community initiatives, regular challenges, and exclusive content are designed to foster loyalty and active participation. The token\u2019s focus on cuteness and fun sets it apart in a market often dominated by technical and financial considerations, offering a refreshing alternative for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Synergy Between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Furrever Token\n\nThe interplay between these three cryptocurrencies highlights the diverse opportunities within the crypto market. Bitcoin\u2019s role as a store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risks, coupled with its significant market movements, sets the stage for broader market trends. Ethereum\u2019s ongoing innovations and potential ETF approval underscore its critical role in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nFurrever Token, while distinct in its approach, leverages the growing interest in meme coins and community-driven projects. Its unique appeal and structured incentives make it an attractive investment, especially in a market environment where investor sentiment can be significantly influenced by novelty and engagement.\n\nConclusion\n\nRobert Kiyosaki\u2019s prediction of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by June 2024 has undoubtedly intensified interest in the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues its bullish trend, Ethereum's technological advancements and potential ETF approval position it for significant growth. Meanwhile, Furrever Token offers a unique and engaging investment opportunity with its charming community-focused approach.\n\nFor investors, this trio represents a balanced portfolio: Bitcoin for stability and long-term growth, Ethereum for innovation and utility, and Furrever Token for high-risk, high-reward potential. As always, thorough research and consideration of individual risk tolerance are essential when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nJoin Furrever Token Presale Now:\n\n\n\nFurrever Token Official Website\n\nVisit Furrever Token Presale\n\nJoin Official Telegram Group\n\nFollow Official X Account\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nRobert Smith\n\nhttps://furrevertoken.com/\n\nsupport (at) furrevertoken.com\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

That makes the long-running project the latest crypto \u201cunicorn,\u201d based on the billion-dollar valuation.\n\nThe latest funding round was led by Kingsway Capital and Animoca Brands; Animoca, a prominent metaverse investment firm, is also the parent of The Sandbox\u2019s operating company, Bacasable Global Limited.

In fact, someone paid $450,000 worth of crypto for a land plot near Snoop Dogg\u2019s metaverse mansion in 2021.\n\nThe game\u2019s SAND token on Ethereum remains one of the 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, per data from CoinGecko. However, the price of its NFT land plots has fallen sharply since metaverse hype peaked in early 2022\u2014from 3.9 ETH ($11,700) to 0.08 ETH ($300) today.\n\n\"Our mission at The Sandbox is to develop creative tools and technologies that bring fairness and new opportunities for all types of creators in the open metaverse,\" said The Sandbox co-founder and CEO Arthur Madrid, in a release.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "Celebrity memecoins have been the latest craze to dominate the crypto space, but Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin says there needs to be more to these projects than what\u2019s currently on offer.\n\nVitalik Buterin would prefer if celebrity crypto projects more value if they had some fun mechanics that go beyond just trading a token.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since celebrity tokens broke into the crypto space, with famous personalities like Davido, Iggy Azalea, Rich The Kid, Trippie Redd, and Caitlyn Jenner all launching memecoins that saw large boosts of trading activity.\n\nIn most cases, these tokens associated with celebrities saw wild upswings in price, followed by a sharp and rapid plunge in value. One exception is Azalea\u2019s Solana-based MOTHER token which surged 2,260% after an initial decline and now sits at a market cap of over $100 million.\n\nThe frenzy around the token prompted a Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske to tweet that if MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation it would also be \u201cthe mother of this cycle\u2019s celebrity experimentation.\u201d\n\nBurniske\u2019s comments invoked a response from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said he was feeling \u201cquite unhappy with \u2018this cycle\u2019s celebrity experimentation\u2019 so far.\u201d\n\nIn order for a celebrity crypto project to gain his respect, Buterin said it would have to offer form of public-good end goal, rather than simply enrich the celebrity who issued the token and early adopters.\n\nIn his view, these projects would have more value if they had some fun mechanics that go beyond just trading a token.\n\n\u201cAs much as I dislike token voting DAOs, at least they give *something* for people to do and organize around. The DAO should not fully decide the agenda, but it can have some influence,\u201d Buterin said.\n\n\u201cMake something that lasts 10+ years, rather than bubbling around for a few months and then being forgotten.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that Buterin doesn\u2019t have a problem with memecoins itself, saying in a March blog post on the subject that he valued people\u2019s desire to have fun, and would rather the crypto space swim with this current than against it.\n\n\u201cI want to see higher quality fun projects that contribute positively to the ecosystem and the world around them (and not just by \u201cbringing in users\u201d) get more mindshare,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nData from Kaito AI shared last month shows that memes were the most dominant crypto narrative after AI, growing its mindshare within the market by 53% from the start of the year until May."

Meanwhile, its 20 million monthly active users surpass Instacart, Robinhood, and Vrbo.\n\nVanEck added that ETH offers cost-saving features, better interconnectivity for social applications, the opportunity to share earnings with end users, and a basis for AI applications.\n\nInvestment risks\n\nWhile the report is optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s future, it also emphasizes several risks associated with investing in ETH.\n\nOne major concern is Ethereum\u2019s reliance on speculative activities, which could lead to significant downside risk if market sentiment shifts.\n\nRegulatory changes pose another risk, as they could classify ETH as a security, thereby imposing stringent legal requirements on Ethereum-based businesses. The competitive landscape is also a threat, with emerging technologies like Solana challenging its market dominance.\n\nAdditionally, government actions to control non-sovereign financial systems could negatively impact Ethereum\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?'\n\nWhen Vitalik Buterin helped found Ethereum in 2013, he envisioned using the platform and blockchain technology as a force for good. He envisioned the network as a means to increase social welfare and provide users access to valuable projects. It makes sense, then, that Buterin has criticized the meme coin craze overtaking the crypto community in 2024. Buterin stated he is not a fan of the meme coin frenzy and prefers the community push \"things in a better direction.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\n\nHolding 0.001 Bitcoin could make you a multimillionaire, according to Fidelity director \u2014 but for how long?\n\nButerin's comments were in response to a post on X regarding the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token, a project centered on rapper Iggy Azalea. \"If $MOTHER breaks into sustainable value creation, it'll also be the mother of this cycle's celebrity experimentation,\" said Chris Burniske on X.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder responded, stating he is \"feeling quite unhappy about with [sic] \u2018this cycle's celebrity experimentation' so far,\" and that he can respect the means \"if the end is worthy (health care, open source software, art, etc).\"\n\nButerin argues that the creators of these tokens use celebrities' names to attract investors while providing little value in return. He contends this practice detracts funds from more useful projects and contradicts his original vision for Ethereum.\n\nCelebrity memecoins have recently become popular among crypto investors. Tokens centered around celebrities like Donald Trump, Caitlyn Jenner, and Elon Musk have attracted billions in investment without providing much value.\n\nWhile most of these meme projects are antithetical to Buterin's grand vision for Ethereum, he mentioned one project that used its funds to add value, though not to the scale he hoped for.\n\n\"Ashton and Mila\u2019s Stoner Cats was vastly more honorable than anything we\u2019ve seen from this 2024 celebrity memecoin era \u2014 at least there was an actual show being funded,\" Buterin noted. The Stoner Cats project featured an NFT collection, which funded an animated show. The project raised enough to hire Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Chris Rock, and Buterin himself as voice actors.\n\nStoner Cats is an example of how crypto project funds can create valuable content. However, the SEC sued Stoner Cats over its NFT offering, resulting in a $1 million civil penalty.\n\nWith many projects aiming to drive up token prices or make quick money, Buterin asks, \"How do we push things in a better direction?\" It will be interesting to see how projects respond to his call-out.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today .\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Responds To Celebrity Memecoins: 'How Do We Push Things In A Better Direction?' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "SEC chair Gary Gensler said the timeline for spot Ethereum ETF launches depends on how quickly applicants respond to the regulator\u2019s questions and comment on reasons for approvals.\n\nGensler told Reuters on June 5 that the firms are \u201cself-motivated\u201d to answer SEC comments and can determine their responsiveness.\n\nPast reports suggest that the SEC will comment on recently amended S-1 registrations from eight spot Ethereum ETF issuers. The applicants will then file further amendments before launching each product.\n\nGensler did not say whether the process would take weeks or months.\n\nGrayscale influenced ETH stance\n\nThe SEC chair said Grayscale\u2019s legal win, which paved the path for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, had also influenced the SEC\u2019s stance on spot ETH products.\n\nGrayscale argued for approving Bitcoin ETFs based on correlations between Bitcoin spot and futures markets, as the SEC approved Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs in previous years.\n\nGensler previously said that the legal outcome led the SEC to approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. He did not connect the outcome to the SEC\u2019s stance on ETH until recently.\n\nGensler told Reuters that market correlations were key to the SEC\u2019s approval of the latest spot Ethereum ETFs. He said:\n\n\u201c[SEC staff] looked at these (ether) filings \u2026 the correlations are relatively similar to the correlations in the bitcoin space.\u201d\n\nGensler spoke to CNBC\n\nGensler made comparable comments in a June 5 CNBC interview, saying that spot ETH ETF launches could \u201ctake some time.\u201d He did not speculate on a launch date.\n\nGensler also told CNBC that the SEC compared the spot Ethereum market to the Ethereum futures market in its latest decision. Gensler said that ETH futures ETFs have traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for more than three years.\n\nIndustry experts have speculated on a launch date, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicting that the ETFs could launch by the end of June and called July 4 an over/under date.\n\nPolymarket, which represents community bets based on staked crypto amounts, displays 57% odds that the funds could begin trading by July 4.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Shanghai Upgrade: How High Can Ethereum (ETH) Go? - DisruptionBanking",
        "content": "Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and the giant behind the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has always been a frontrunner in innovation from the get-go.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade, also known as \u201cShapella\u201d\u2014 a coinage of Shanghai and Capella, Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers, respectively\u2014implemented on April 12, 2023, marked a major leap forward by finalizing Ethereum\u2019s full transition to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) network. But this is also changing the staking and liquidity of ether (ETH) as we know it.\n\nETH\u2019s adoption growth was mainly driven by the Shanghai upgrade, which allows withdrawals of staked $ETH, and the popularity of liquid staking. pic.twitter.com/iepA0hCHh3 \u2014 Crypto.com (@cryptocom) January 26, 2024\n\nThe Technical Side of the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a \u201chard fork\u201d that introduced several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-4895 being the most notable. This proposal introduces a new system-level operation to streamline the process for validators to withdraw their staked ether (ETH), allowing for more freedom and flexibility. Gone are the days of the manual process, as EIP-4895 automatically funnels withdrawals from the Beacon Chain to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) once they\u2019re eligible.\n\nValidators have staked about 16 million ETH to secure the network. Since September 2022, when Merge shifted Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, validators have played a critical role. Under the new rule, by staking 32 ETH, validators can participate in block validation, with each staked ETH increasing the chance of earning block rewards. However, the Merge required validators to lock up their ETH and rewards until a future update.\n\nEIP-4895 simplifies this process by automatically checking accounts for eligible excess balances every few days instead of requiring manual requests.\n\nIn a nutshell, validators, as key players in Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism, stake ETH to secure the network and validate transactions. Each staked ETH acts like a golden ticket, which enhances the odds of being chosen to propose the next block and earn rewards. Before the Shanghai upgrade, staked ETH and rewards were locked. Still, the upgrade now allows validators to withdraw their assets, which has considerable implications for Ethereum\u2019s liquidity and the staking dynamics.\n\nImpact on Staking and Liquidity\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade fundamentally changed the game for stakers.\n\nThe #Shanghai upgrade allows validators to withdraw staked $ETH locked in the Beacon chain\n\n\n\nAfter one year from that, explore the $ETH supply among the top LSD entities since the Shanghai upgrade\n\n\n\nNotable top 3\n\nLido: + 3.47M\n\nBinance: + 896K\n\nRocketPool: + 291K $LDO $RPL $ANKR\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5dY26Ob4Tw \u2014 Layer2Gather (@layer2gather) April 12, 2024\n\nWith staked ETH now unlocked, validators can freely withdraw their holdings or stakes and claim rewards freely. This newfound liquidity is a win-win for both investors seeking staking rewards and the Ethereum network itself, which benefits from increased security through staking.\n\nMoreover, liquid staking providers, which offer staking services to users with smaller ETH holdings, may see increased usage due to the ability to unlock staked ETH. These platforms, which charge a fee on staking income, could become even more popular.\n\nMarket Position and Ripple Effects\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade caused quite a stir in the crypto market at the time. The release of unlocked ETH potentially tipped the scales for Ethereum\u2019s position and price, as multiple reports have shown.\n\nIn all, during Ethereum\u2019s transition to PoS, ETH\u2019s price hovered around $1,800. Right after \u201cShapella,\u201d ETH\u2019s price rose slightly, trading 1.4% higher within 24 hours. It jumped more than 6% immediately after the upgrade, crossing $2,000 for the first time in nearly a year.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0#DidYouKnow that Ethereum staking APY hit 8.76%, a historical high.\n\nAnd $ETH net deposit saw daily growth after Shanghai Upgrade.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc40Will the fact that the more staked $ETH & the less circulating pump $ETH price soon?\n\nStay close: https://t.co/OfKehFd4Vu pic.twitter.com/Fr5zZ927D5 \u2014 Gate.io (@gate_io) May 16, 2023\n\nCrypto trading advisor Laurent Kssis of CEC Capital predicted short-term volatility as traders who bought ETH in anticipation of the upgrade sold their holdings to cash out. Kssis suggested that this selling could lead to a strong supply of ether flooding the market, potentially causing the price to drop. At the time of his prediction, ETH was trading near $1,875, and he speculated that it could drop below $1,700 for the first time in two weeks as investors take profits.\n\nDespite short-term fluctuations, at the time, the long-term impact of the upgrade could be positive, particularly if institutional investors are attracted by the increased security and stability of the PoS system. This could boost institutional demand for Ethereum, potentially driving its price in the long run.\n\nMoreover, the Shanghai upgrade wasn\u2019t just about validator rewards. The upgrade also included proposals to address Ethereum\u2019s major weaknesses: slow transaction speeds and high fees. These issues have been a thorn in the sides of DeFi and NFT applications. The surge in DeFi activity has significantly increased the total value locked (TVL) on the Ethereum chain, and the NFT boom from 2021 to early 2022 has further exacerbated these problems, leading to poor user experiences and high transaction costs.\n\nProposals EIP-3855 and EIP-3860, part of the upgrade, address these issues to make transactions faster and cheaper. This could reignite interest in DeFi and NFTs on the Ethereum network. While EIP-3855 should help address transaction speeds, and EIP-3860 hopes to reduce transaction costs, their broader effect on ETH transactions remains to be seen.\n\nEIP-4895: enables validators to withdraw their stake of 32 $ETH from the staking contract on the Ethereum blockchain since the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).https://t.co/x1mGqv9ZZR \u2014 IQ (@IQWIKI) April 3, 2023\n\nThese improvements might encourage ecosystems affected by high gas fees and slow transactions, which had moved to other chains like Solana or Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Polygon, to consider a comeback.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade is a watershed moment for the platform itself and the entire crypto landscape. By enabling validator withdrawals, the upgrade has not only boosted Ethereum\u2019s liquidity but also has the potential to shape its market position. As Ethereum progresses on its innovative path, it will be interesting to see how these developments shape the future of decentralized finance and digital ownership and ultimately influence the future of the entire crypto landscape.\n\nAuthor: Ayanfe Fakunle\n\nThe editorial team at #DisruptionBanking has taken all precautions to ensure that no persons or organisations have been adversely affected or offered any sort of financial advice in this article.

        "content": "Analysts from the investment management firm VanEck have updated their Ethereum ETH/USD price prediction for 2030, setting a new target of $22,000.\n\nWhat Happened: VanEck, which is currently seeking approval to list a spot Ether ETF, announced the revised forecast on Wednesday. as per a report by The Block. The new price target is based on the potential of Ether ETFs, Ethereum\u2019s scaling progress, and on-chain data analysis.\n\nThe VanEck report authors, who hold positions in Ethereum directly or through private funds, believe that Ethereum\u2019s ongoing market share growth and its leading position among smart contract platforms could bolster a $2.2 trillion asset, or $22,000 per coin, by 2030.\n\nThe $22,000 price target is the authors\u2019 base case price target. The bullish and bearish price predictions were $154,000 and $360, respectively.\n\nWhy It Matters: VanEck is one of several Wall Street firms aiming to list spot ether ETFs in the wake of successful spot Bitcoin BTC/USD ETFs launched earlier this year. The SEC gave the green light to spot Ether ETFs last month.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that spot Ether ETFs are nearing approval to trade on U.S. stock exchanges,\u201d said the VanEck analysts. They estimate that these ETFs could draw between $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion in net inflows during their first five months of trading. The optimism is in contrast to SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s position, who hinted at delays.\n\nThese estimates come on the heels of recent projections by cryptocurrency analyst Flow, who fixed a base price target of $5,294 for ETH by the end of 2024. The bullish and bearish price predictions were $6,730\u200b and $4,428, respectively.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was exchanging hands at $3,863.06, following a 1.37% increase in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Will Dogecoin\u2019s Price Discovery Follow Bitcoin Like It Did Historically?\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors."

Meanwhile, Furrever Token (FURR) offers a distinct opportunity with its 25% bonus on new purchases, promising a unique blend of fun and high returns. Could this be the key to capitalizing on the thriving crypto market?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Unprecedented ETF Inflow\n\nBitcoin's recent ETF approval has unleashed an $886 million inflow, catapulting its price and reaffirming its dominance. This monumental surge reflects the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin among institutional investors, driving substantial growth and setting the stage for continued momentum. The influx of capital is not only boosting Bitcoin's market cap but also enhancing its liquidity, making it an even more attractive investment.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has been the bellwether of the cryptocurrency market, often setting the trend for other digital assets. The recent ETF approval signifies a major milestone, providing a regulated and accessible avenue for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This has led to a renewed wave of optimism and interest from both retail and institutional investors, further cementing Bitcoin\u2019s status as the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Anticipated Growth\n\nEthereum, with its robust ecosystem and ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, is poised for significant gains. The potential approval of an Ethereum ETF is expected to draw in massive capital, similar to Bitcoin's recent experience. This influx could propel Ethereum to new heights, attracting a broader range of investors and reinforcing its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain industry.\n\nEthereum's unique value proposition lies in its smart contract functionality and its vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). The ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to address some of the network's biggest challenges, such as scalability and high transaction fees, by shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This upgrade is expected to enhance Ethereum's performance, making it more efficient and sustainable in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token: Capitalizing on the Crypto Wave\n\nIn the midst of Bitcoin and Ethereum's impressive performances, Furrever Token (FURR) emerges as an enticing investment with its limited-time 25% bonus offer.

By integrating cute cat-themed stickers, emojis, and visuals into its ecosystem, Furrever Token aims to create a fun and enjoyable experience for its users. This focus on community and engagement sets it apart from more traditional, serious blockchain projects.\n\nThe project has already raised over $1.2 million, aiming to reach $1.9 million before its launch on PancakeSwap. This limited-time bonus, available until June 10, 2024, presents an excellent opportunity for investors to enhance their holdings and position themselves for substantial future gains.\n\nRiding the Momentum of Major Cryptos\n\nThe success of Bitcoin and Ethereum paves the way for other cryptocurrencies to thrive. As these giants attract more capital and attention, the overall market sentiment improves, benefiting projects like Furrever Token. The 25% bonus offer provides a strategic entry point for investors to capitalize on this positive market environment.\n\nFurrever Token\u2019s well-structured tokenomics and strong community engagement further solidify its appeal.

Regular audits and safety measures are in place to provide a secure and enjoyable experience for all users. This focus on security and community trust enhances Furrever Token's credibility and attractiveness as an investment.\n\nSeizing the Opportunity with Furrever Token\n\nWith the crypto market experiencing unprecedented growth, now is the perfect time to diversify your portfolio with Furrever Token. The limited-time 25% bonus offer not only enhances your investment but also aligns you with a project that promises both financial returns and a sense of community.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on this opportunity to invest in a promising project while benefiting from the market momentum generated by Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs Brace For Sluggish Reception, JPMorgan Expects Modest $1-$3 Billion Inflows | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "According to a Bloomberg report, analysts suggest that the debut of the recently approved Ethereum ETFs in the US may generate significantly less demand than spot-Bitcoin products. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, await final approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the long-awaited Ethereum funds.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan strategists anticipate much smaller net inflows into Ethereum ETFs than the $15.3 billion flowing into Bitcoin vehicles this year.\n\nAnalysts Divided On Ethereum ETFs\u2019 Potential\n\nPer the report, the success of the five-month-old Bitcoin ETFs can be attributed to a controversial narrative that presents Bitcoin as digital gold, a concept that Ether lacks. Additionally, the Ether funds will not offer staking rewards for blockchain maintenance, a feature available to those who hold the token directly.\n\nCaroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets Pty, highlights that ETH lacks the same profile as Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s market value of $1.4 trillion is three times larger than Ether\u2019s. This discrepancy indicates that the Ethereum ETFs in the US may not have a comparable impact.\n\n\n\nIn a surprising shift, the SEC recently signaled its willingness to approve spot Ethereum ETFs, following its earlier acceptance of Bitcoin funds due to a court reversal in 2023. While this development boosted Ether\u2019s price, its 109% gains over the past year still lag behind Bitcoin\u2019s 169% surge, including its record high in March.\n\nJPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimate that prospective Ether portfolios will attract a \u201cmodest\u201d $1 billion to $3 billion in net inflows for the remainder of the year.\n\nHowever, as Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, reports, these products may struggle to capture 20% of the current $62.5 billion Bitcoin ETF assets in the US.\n\nDespite these reservations, Vetle Lunde, a senior research analyst at crypto specialist K33 Research, remains optimistic, predicting $4 billion worth of net inflows in the first five months for the Ethereum ETFs and a significant \u201csupply absorption shock\u201d that could boost ETH\u2019s price.\n\nVanEck Bullish On Ethereum\n\nFund manager VanEck, which aims to launch an Ethereum ETF, sees potential in the popularity of the Ethereum blockchain underlying the token, particularly for applications in crypto financial services.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s Head of Digital-Asset Research, believes that investors will eventually recognize the greater potential for application and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem than Bitcoin.\n\nIt is worth noting that the launch of nine new US ETFs for Bitcoin on January 11 initially caused a decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price, coupled with outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. However, the strength of demand for the new ETFs eventually overshadowed these concerns, and Bitcoin resumed its upward trajectory.\n\nSimilarly, asset manager Grayscale plans to convert its $11 billion Ethereum offering into an ETF, similar to its Bitcoin fund. While redemptions from the Grayscale fund may create selling pressure on ETH, the overall market impact remains unclear.\n\nAs of the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,830, while Bitcoin continues to approach its record levels of $73,7000 reached in March. Ether is still some distance away from its all-time peak of $4,866, achieved during the 2021 bull run.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Hong Kong issuers are allegedly working toward incorporating staking into their ETH ETFs.\n\nProShares submits 19b-4 application for spot ETH ETF.\n\nEthereum will likely continue its range-bound movement over the weekend.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down more than 3% on Friday following news that Hong Kong will allow issuers to integrate staking features into their spot ETH ETFs. ProShares also submitted a 19b-4 application for a spot ETH ETF with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Hong Kong ETFs, ProShares join the train\n\nEthereum ETFs are the main subject of discussions surrounding the number one altcoin. Here are the latest market movers:\n\nHong Kong asset managers are allegedly working toward incorporating staking features into their spot Ethereum ETFs, according to Animoca Brands co-founder and Executive Chairman Yat Siu. Hong Kong crypto ETFs have struggled to garner investors' attention despite the excitement surrounding their initial launch.\n\n\n\nHowever, with the added rewards of staking, Hong Kong ETH ETFs could be attractive to investors worldwide, especially as the SEC has signaled that it won't permit issuers to offer staking if/when spot ETH ETFs launch in the US.\n\nRead more: Ethereum ecosystem active users spike 55% in Q1, 2x ETH ETF records impressive volume\n\nAsset manager ProShares submitted a 19b-4 form with the SEC on Thursday, stating intentions to issue spot Ethereum ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The move puts ProShares as the latest member in the list of prospective spot ETH ETF issuers.\n\n\n\nThe SEC earlier approved the 19b-4 filings of eight issuers on May 23, including Van Eck, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Invesco & Galaxy, Grayscale and 21Shares. Following the approval, issuers submitted updated S-1 registration statements with the SEC, which the agency must approve before the ETFs go live.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum open interest surges by 50%, SEC Chair says ETH ETF launch will take more time\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler told Reuters on Wednesday that the timing for spot ETH ETFs to launch depended on how responsive issuers are to the SEC's comment on their S-1s.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum to sustain range-bound move over the weekend\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,781 as it continues its range-bound movement on Friday. The ETH long/short ratio is skewed toward shorts, with a 48% to 52% difference in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. This indicates a slight bias towards a bearish view, especially as ETH's long liquidations are at $52.14 million compared to $7.37 million of short liquidations.\n\nRead more: Ethereum leveraged ETFs go live as price fails to react\n\nConsidering current market conditions, Ethereum will likely stay above the $3,730 support.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, higher bearish sentiment will see the $3,618 support become the next key price to watch out for. ETH may sustain the horizontal move over the weekend and before beginning another attempt toward the $3,901 resistance.\n\nA successful move above the resistance will see ETH begin a move to tackle the $4,093 yearly high before aiming for a new all-time high.\n\nA daily candlestick close below the $3,300 level will invalidate the bullish thesis."

        "content": "Ethereum price has been consolidating amid a bigger market structure\u2014the bull flag. Investors are watching closely for when the price of Ethereum decides to move higher, as 30% gains may be at stake if they miss the move. In the meantime, Bitcoin adoption continues to soar as BTC price seeks to break the previous all-time high price.\n\nETH price hovered around $3,811 during European trading hours on Friday, a 1.3% decrease in 24 hours and a 1.4% increase in 7 days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH/BTC Price Analysis: Ethereum Price Creeping Up Channel, May Breakout in Less than 1 Week\n\nEthereum price has been stuck in the current consolidation zone for the past eight days. Nevertheless, this chart pattern is part of a previously formed bull flag with massive profit implications if it breaks out.\n\nThe price of Ethereum is trending above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA), signaling bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nAdditionally, ETH price action has been creeping up an ascending channel, which indicates a short accumulation phase before a breakout.\n\nExtending the channel shows ETH price may try a breakout in about 4 days if all factors remain constant. However, fundamental news can either make or break the current Ethereum market structure.\n\nOn the other side, Bitcoin price is also sporting a bull flag, but in a 4-hour timeframe. The price is also trending above the 50-day and 200-day SMA, a bullish signal for the asset. BTC price is currently en route to testing the upper boundary of the range.\n\nIf it manages to break out, we may see a $74,000 Bitcoin price in the coming days. $72,300 may push some resistance, but if the bulls are strong enough, they may slice through this barrier easily. On the flip side, strong support exists around $67,000 that may hold up the price.\n\nETH/BTC Price Future Outlook\n\nEthereum price went from $2,800 to $3,900 in one candle, and it is currently holding up well at $3,700 to $3,800. All this is happening before the S-1 applications are approved and an ETF is launched.\n\nWhile Bitcoin grinds up slowly, ETH price holds the keys to big gains after $4,000 with the ETF launch. The market is eagerly waiting for S-1 clarity as the 10-day window to revoke the ETF has elapsed.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s open interest hits a new high at 520,000 BTC, exceeding March\u2019s all-time high. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs are thriving with $488.1 million inflows.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe crypto markets are full of speculation, which often proves accurate. The Bitcoin ETF represents the best-case scenario. As investors speculate on the ETA of the Ethereum ETF, there is a general sentiment that the SEC is stalling and that ETF approval is inevitable. Investors eagerly await the outcome of this ETF struggle.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvans Karanja Evans Karanja is a crypto analyst and journalist with a deep focus on blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the video gaming industry.

It\u2019s a sort of accelerationism and not only because of good execution but also because of contrarianism.\u201d\n\nIn response, Yakovenko, while praising ETH\u2019s decision to prioritize security over scalability, he said,\n\n\u201cPeople think Ethereum is moving slowly but if you look at the size of the network, its value\u2026I would be terrified of any changes to Solana if it was at that value.\u201d\n\nHe further went ahead and added,\n\n\u201cEthereum is at a point which I think every other L1 should be envious of, and try to get there as fast as they can. All of that I think puts it in a class in my mind actually above Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis highlights that Ethereum is still the winner in the L1 space owing to the most network effects, liquidity, maturity, and security, making it pre-ordained to surpass Bitcoin and become number one.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, Drake justified that Solana could become the \u2018internet of value\u2019, justifying its $100 billion valuation.\n\nHe further added that SOL\u2019s developers are more focused on building user-targeting products rather than infrastructure, which contributes to its success.\n\nSOL a competitor to ETH?\n\nAdding to the fray, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and Global Macro Investor, drawing parallels with ETH\u2019s 2020 bull run highlighted Solana\u2019s emergence as a strong Ethereum competitor.\n\nHe best put it when he said,"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, Litecoin (LTC) has surged ahead of Ethereum (ETH) in terms of daily transactions and active addresses. According to a tweet by IntoTheBlock , the number of active Litecoin addresses surged by an impressive 75% yesterday, marking the highest activity level since January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis surge has pushed Litecoin to surpass Ethereum by over 100,000 active addresses. The tweet highlighted the significant spike in Litecoin's activity, stating that the number of LTC transactions hit 426,000 yesterday. While the majority of the increase is attributed to transactions under $10, there has been a noticeable rise in transactions across all sizes.\n\nLitecoin's surge\n\nThe data indicates that Litecoin is experiencing a significant uptick in usage and popularity. The number of LTC transactions hitting 426,000 in a single day is a notable milestone, reflecting growing confidence and interest in the cryptocurrency. This surge can be attributed to several factors. For instance, Litecoin has been steadily gaining traction as a preferred cryptocurrency for transactions due to its lower fees and faster transaction times than Bitcoin (BTC) .\n\nThis has made it a popular choice for small transactions and everyday use. Moreover, Litecoin's network efficiency and lower transaction costs have made it an attractive option for users looking for a reliable and cost-effective means of transferring value. The recent surge in smaller transactions under $10 suggests users increasingly turn to Litecoin for microtransactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the Litecoin ecosystem has expanded, with new developments and partnerships that enhance its usability and adoption. These include integrations with payment processors and wallet providers, making it easier for users to transact with LTC. The recent surge in activity is a positive indicator of LTC\u2019s potential for continued growth and adoption. Litecoin's focus on transaction efficiency and lower fees positions it well to attract a broader user base."

Fast. pic.twitter.com/8XLtyN5dv5 \u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 5, 2024\n\nIn Q1 2020, Ethereum and its solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon had an average of over 250, 000 users daily. Fast forward to Q1 2024, and this number has grown to about 2. 25 million with Layer-2 solutions such as Optimism, Base, and zkSync among others.\n\nThis shift towards layer-2 solutions has seen Ethereum\u2019s mainnet user base reduced to 378,000 active users while Polygon alone has 1. 3 million users, with the other layer-2 networks having approximately 1. 5 million active users in total.\n\nLayer-2 scaling is considered by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as an essential component of Ethereum\u2019s development plan, comparing it to the sharding idea from the previous Eth 2 strategy. This strategy is to promote development in several subcultures of Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the issuer of one of the most popular crypto ETFs, VanEck, has raised its forecast for the Ethereum price to $22,000 by 2030 due to high revenue per user and the ability to attract financial market players and Big Tech.\n\nEther is currently at $3,862 and with the rumors of spot Ether ETFs in the near future, many people are expecting Ethereum to reach new highs. However, some warn that flows into these new crypto ETFs could be lower than that of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe extensive use of layer-2 solutions on Ethereum has increased the network\u2019s user base by more than 2. 25 million daily active users in the first quarter of 2024, which will significantly change the network\u2019s scale and openness."

This is the impressive forecast by VanEck for the native crypto of the Ethereum blockchain. This ambitious estimate draws the attention of experts and investors worldwide. But what justifies such an evaluation?\n\nVanEck sees big for Ethereum\n\nCurrently, ether is trading around $3,852, a value that may seem modest compared to VanEck\u2019s ambitious forecasts. The investment company, in its recent report, envisions a future where ether would reach the staggering sum of $22,000 by 2030. This prediction highlights the enormous growth potential of this crypto and its disruptive capabilities in the global financial landscape.\n\nVanEck, renowned for its sharp analyses and bold forecasts, anticipates a major transformation of the market thanks to Ethereum. This projection, though spectacular, is supported by current trends and notable advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem, positioning its native crypto as a key player in the evolution of the digital economy.\n\nThe arguments put forward by VanEck to justify this explosive growth\n\nOne of the main growth drivers for ether, according to VanEck, is its revolutionary aspect. Ethereum offers a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that can transform various sectors, including traditional finance, digital payments, and even artificial intelligence. This capacity to disrupt and innovate positions Ethereum as a potential leader in the new era of the digital economy.\n\nAnother key factor is the development of ether-based ETFs. According to VanEck, the approval and widespread adoption of Ethereum ETFs will facilitate institutional investors\u2019 access to this asset. This opening to large investors could significantly increase the demand and liquidity of ether, thereby consolidating its market position.\n\nFinally, the on-chain data analysis conducted by VanEck reveals promising financial indicators for Ethereum. The report highlights significant cash flows estimated at $66 billion and sustained network activity, reinforcing the robustness and long-term viability of the Ethereum blockchain. These observations enable VanEck to justify its optimistic prediction of $22,000 per ether by 2030.\n\nThe future of ether according to VanEck looks promising with a bold forecast of $22,000 by 2030. It remains to be seen whether these predictions will materialize in an ever-changing crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Recently, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicated that the approval of Ethereum ETFs could be a prolonged process. This statement was reported by Fox journalist Eleanor Terrett, highlighting a methodical and cautious approach by the SEC.\n\nCrypto: the approval of the S-1 form for Ethereum ETFs is not for now!\n\nGensler expressed concerns regarding the practices of crypto exchanges, which, according to him, are conducting operations that current laws would never allow on traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. These comments highlight the regulatory differences between traditional markets and cryptocurrency platforms and raise questions about how regulators can adapt to these new asset classes.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs is a subject of great anticipation as it could pave the way for broader adoption of crypto by institutional investors and traditional traders. However, the SEC\u2019s caution suggests that the S-1 form approval process might take longer than some market players had hoped.\n\nThe SEC has already approved ETFs for other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, but the approval process for Ethereum seems to be different. Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by a committee of five members, including the SEC Chairman, Ethereum ETFs were approved by the SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets. This difference in the approval process has piqued the curiosity of the crypto community, wondering why there was a change in the procedure.\n\nThe regulatory implications of the SEC!\n\nThe implications of these statements are vast. On the one hand, they indicate a growing recognition of the legitimacy and importance of crypto in the modern financial landscape. On the other hand, they reveal a regulatory approach that remains cautious and thoughtful in the face of rapid innovation and the potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies.\n\nFinally, although the approval of Ethereum ETFs is a positive development for the crypto industry, Gensler\u2019s remarks remind investors and market participants of the importance of patience and diligence while waiting for regulatory decisions. The SEC, as the guardian of the integrity of financial markets, continues to play a crucial role in balancing innovation and investor protection.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Mohamed-Amin Atcha, Mohamed Rilaz Waleedh, and Daood Hassan are accused of wire fraud and money laundering in what authorities called a pump-and-dump scheme.\n\nThe DOJ said the charges stemmed from a 2021 scheme to get NFT collectors to purchase one of \u201c10,000 unique\u201d Ethereum-based NFTs called Evolved Apes that could then be used in an online battle royale game.

        "content": "Gensler\u2019s remarks on Ethereum ETFs evoke speculation on SEC\u2019s review pace.\n\nSEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETF listing requests hints at an evolving stance.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community is abuzz with speculation following recent comments by SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nIn a report by Reuters, Gensler indicated that the approval process for spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States hinges on the responsiveness of issuers to the SEC\u2019s feedback. He said,\n\n\u201cThese registrants are self-motivated to be responsive to the comments they get, but it\u2019s really up to them how responsive they are.\u201d\n\nThis development has sparked optimism among many who feared prolonged delays, suggesting that the SEC may be moving towards a more accelerated review process.\n\nHowever, in a separate conversation with the CNBC Squawk Box, Gensler said,\n\n\u201cThe underlying exchange trade products still need to go through a process to have the disclosure about that. Now, that will take some time but they are working on that right now.\u201d\n\nSome interpreted this as a sign that the commission might take their time approving the S-1 Forms.\n\nThis juxtaposition raises questions about SEC\u2019s stance on the industry.\n\nWhen discussing the broader crypto market, Gensler said,\n\n\u201cExchanges like the New York Stock Exchanges (NYSE) get properly regulated to protect against fraud regulation and they don\u2019t trade against you. And these crypto exchanges are doing things that we would never allow NYSE to do.\u201d\n\nHow did ETH react?\n\nThese diverging remarks caused notable fluctuations in ETH prices. At the time of writing, ETH was changing hands at $3,819.16, reflecting a 0.70% drop in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe technical indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above the 50 mark, indicating significant buying pressure.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s role in Ethereum ETF\n\nThe SEC\u2019s change in tone on spot Ether ETFs before the deadline remains unexplained.\n\nHowever, in discussions with Reuters, Gensler hinted that this decision may have been influenced by Grayscale\u2019s legal challenge regarding Bitcoin ETFs from the previous year.\n\nGrayscale had argued that since the SEC approved Bitcoin futures ETFs, there was no reason to deny spot Bitcoin ETFs. Gensler said the case was similar with Ethereum as ETH futures have been trading since last year."

        "title": "StakingFarm CEO Highlights Impact of Staking on Ethereum Liquidity - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "London, England, June 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\n\n\nStakingFarm, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency staking industry, has released new insights from its CEO, Klajdi Toci, on the significant impact that staking has had on Ethereum (ETH) liquidity. According to Toci, staking has emerged as a major liquidity sink for ETH, a phenomenon that has drawn the attention of analysts and market observers alike.\n\nDespite the surge in Ethereum prices since Q4 of last year, the three-month circulating supply of ETH has not seen a meaningful increase. This stagnation in circulating supply, as noted by StakingFarm's analysts, underscores the profound effect that staking has on the availability of ETH in the market. As more investors lock their ETH in staking contracts to earn rewards, the overall liquidity of Ethereum decreases, influencing market dynamics and price movements.\n\n\"The surge in ETH staking has created a unique situation where a significant portion of the asset is effectively removed from circulation,\" said Klajdi Toci, CEO of StakingFarm. \"This reduction in liquid supply can have various implications for the market, including potential price volatility and changes in investor behavior.\"\n\nStakingFarm, known for its innovative staking solutions and user-centric platform, has observed these trends firsthand. The platform offers a range of staking opportunities, allowing users to lock their ETH and other cryptocurrencies in return for rewards. This practice not only supports the security and operation of blockchain networks but also provides a source of passive income for investors.\n\nHowever, the growing popularity of staking has led to a substantial amount of ETH being locked up, thereby reducing its availability in the open market. This trend highlights the dual-edged nature of staking: while it benefits individual investors through rewards, it also impacts overall market liquidity.\n\n\"Understanding the liquidity implications of staking is crucial for both investors and the broader market,\" Toci added. \"At StakingFarm, we are committed to providing our users with the information and tools they need to navigate these complex dynamics effectively.\"\n\nStakingFarm's analysis aligns with broader industry observations. Analysts have noted that the reduced liquidity resulting from increased staking activities can lead to heightened price volatility. As the circulating supply of ETH remains constrained, even minor market events can trigger significant price fluctuations, creating both opportunities and risks for traders and investors.\n\nIn response to these developments, StakingFarm continues to enhance its platform, offering advanced tools and insights to help users make informed decisions. The platform's commitment to transparency and user education ensures that investors are well-equipped to understand and manage the liquidity dynamics associated with staking.\n\nAs the Ethereum network and the broader cryptocurrency market continue to evolve, StakingFarm remains at the forefront of innovation, providing solutions that cater to the diverse needs of its users. By staying attuned to market trends and investor behaviors, StakingFarm aims to foster a more resilient and informed staking community.\n\nFor more information about StakingFarm and to explore Ethereum staking opportunities, please visit https://stakingfarm.com/.\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\n\nName: Klajdi Toci\n\nPosition: CEO\n\nEmail: info (at) stakingfarm.com\n\nWebsite: www.stakingfarm.com\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "VanEck Predicts Explosive Ethereum Growth: Could ETH Reach $2.2 Trillion? - TradingView",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is poised for a meteoric rise, according to a new analysis by VanEck, a leading asset management firm. The report predicts that Ethereum could reach a valuation of $2.2 trillion by 2030, translating to a price of around $22,000 per coin. This ambitious prediction hinges on Ethereum\u2019s dominance in the smart contracts arena and its potential to generate a staggering $66 billion in free cash flow by the end of the decade.\n\nTraditional Finance Embraces Ethereum With ETF Approval\n\nA key driver behind VanEck\u2019s bullish outlook is the recent approval of spot Ether ETFs on US stock exchanges. These ETFs allow traditional financial institutions and investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of directly holding the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis increased accessibility has broadened Ethereum\u2019s appeal, attracting financial advisors, institutional investors, and even Big Tech firms. The influx of these new players has bolstered Ethereum\u2019s legitimacy and instilled confidence in its long-term potential.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nA Network Powerhouse With Room For Growth\n\nThe Ethereum network boasts a robust user base, processing around $4 trillion worth of transactions and facilitating $5.5 trillion in stablecoin transfers over the past year. This impressive activity highlights Ethereum\u2019s position as a vital cog in the decentralized finance (DeFi) machine.\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis factors in Ethereum\u2019s ongoing evolution, including the rising adoption of applications built on its platform, the increasing scarcity of ETH tokens due to burning mechanisms, and its potential to capture a larger share of the burgeoning blockchain market. The report estimates the total addressable market (TAM) for blockchain applications to be a staggering $15 trillion, indicating vast room for Ethereum\u2019s growth.Will Ethereum Become The Silicon Valley Of Blockchain?\n\nVanEck\u2019s analysis paints a picture of Ethereum as a potential \u201cSilicon Valley of Blockchain,\u201d a platform that fosters innovation and disrupts traditional industries. The ability to build and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum empowers developers to create new applications and financial instruments that could revolutionize sectors like supply chain management, identity verification, and even voting systems. As Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem flourishes, the value proposition of holding ETH tokens strengthens, potentially fueling the predicted price surge.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nEther Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, according to the latest forecast, Ether is expected to rise by 2.13%, reaching $3,861 by July 6, 2024. This projection is supported by a set of technical indicators that currently signal a bullish sentiment. The overall market sentiment for Ethereum is optimistic, with a Fear & Greed Index reading of 78, indicating \u201cExtreme Greed.\u201d This index measures market emotions and sentiment from various sources, and a high level like this often signals that investors are becoming overly confident, which can sometimes precede a market correction.\n\nIn terms of recent performance, Ethereum has experienced 17 green days out of the last 30, translating to a 57% rate of positive daily performance. This indicates a generally upward trend with consistent gains. However, over the past 30 days, Ethereum has shown an 11.30% volatility rate. This level of volatility is relatively high, implying that while the price is expected to rise, it could experience significant fluctuations.\n\nFeatured image from InvestorsObserver, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "Christine Kim, the Vice President on the Research team at Galaxy just took to the X platform to highlight the latest task that Ethereum (ETH) developers are undertaking regarding Pectra upgrade. The X post comes after the blockchain\u2019s All Core Developers Execution Call (ACDE) on June 6.\n\nEthereum Developers to Expand Pectra With 2 EIPs\n\nAccording to the Galaxy Researcher, Ethereum developers agreed to further expand the scope of the Pectra upgrade yesterday with the inclusion of EOF and EIP 7702 to the Pectra upgrade. The All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) Call #189 held over Zoom and was chaired by Ethereum Foundation (EF) Protocol Support Lead Tim Beiko.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe simultaneous integration of both solutions is likely to trigger delays in multi-client testing for the upgrade. Hence, the protocol developers plan to activate EOF on later-stage devnets. The developers are also considering conducting the activation on a different activation epoch from other EIPs, just like how developers plan on testing PeerDAS.\n\nThe feedback pooled from various EL client teams and the EF DevOps team suggest that they are in support of the integration of EOF on Pectra.\n\nEL EIPs CONFIRMED FOR PRAGUE:\n\n\u2013 EIP 2537\n\n\u2013 EIP 2935\n\n\u2013 EIP 7685\n\n\u2013 EOF\n\n\u2013 EIP 7702 pic.twitter.com/uGf6Fm6eFs \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) June 6, 2024\n\nThere was only one opposition view from Geth. Guillaume Ballet, one of Geth\u2019s developer said, outline notable fears bothering on Verkle functionality.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that the more we wait, the longer the Verkle translation will take. Is EOF really that urgent? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve read several the arguments for shipping it in Prague. The more I read those arguments, the more I realize, no, there\u2019s nothing that really justifies EOF,\u201d he said\n\nA significant percentage of the Ethereum protocol developers disagreed with this stance. One \u201cKamil Sliwak\u201d noted that EOF would be \u201ca huge improvement\u201d particularly for users interacting with the compiler for Ethereum\u2019s smart contract programming language Solidity.\n\nDevelopers Decide on the Integration of EOF\n\nIn the meantime, discussions are ongoing about the preferred approach for integrating EOF. Beiko\u2019s recommendation is that they aim to ship all Pectra EIPs including EOF in one client release. For the present purposes of testing, he encouraged developers to consider the use of devnet to stage the implementation of these code changes.\n\nFor these developers, the inclusion of EIP 7702 is as a replacement to EIP 3074, although there are still certain issues with the specifications for EIP 7702. Ethereum protocol developers are putting efforts and resources in separate breakout room to fix these challenges.\n\nThis potential additions could impact on the price of Ethereum. Noteworthy, the altcoin has been showing bullish signs since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted spot Ethereum ETFs. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,790.62 with a 1.29% dip within the last 24 hours. Investors are hopeful that it would break through to $5,000 in keeping with projections from top analysts.\n\nRead More: Customers Bank Reportedly Debanks Crypto Hedge Funds Amid FDIC Alert\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "Fri 07 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nThe crypto universe is buzzing. Ethereum is set to launch a major update to its technology in Q1 2025. Named Pectra, this update promises significant improvements for users and developers. Let\u2019s explore in detail what this evolution will bring and why it is so highly anticipated.\n\nPectra incorporates several technological innovations that will transform the crypto ecosystem. Among these innovations are the EVM Object Format (EOF) and EIP-7702, proposed by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEOF is designed to improve the security and efficiency of smart contracts on Ethereum. By integrating this format, Ethereum will enable safer and faster transactions, reducing the risks of bugs and exploits.\n\nEIP-7702 allows Ethereum account addresses to temporarily act as smart contract wallets during transactions. This feature will offer increased flexibility to users, allowing them to manage their crypto more efficiently and securely.\n\nThe Pectra update also aims to resolve persistent issues, such as high transaction fees on Layer 2 platforms. By integrating around 19 EIPs, Ethereum ensures that the user experience will be significantly improved.\n\nA Strategically Chosen Timeline\n\nEthereum developers have carefully planned the deployment of Pectra for Q1 2025. This decision was made after lengthy discussions and thorough evaluations.\n\nThe developers decided not to rush the deployment before Devcon, the largest developer conference in the Asia-Pacific region. By delaying the update, they ensure the full integration of all features, allowing crypto users to enjoy a stable and reliable version.\n\nBy avoiding deployment during Devcon, the developers can effectively monitor the execution of Pectra. This cautious approach aims to minimize risks and ensure a smooth launch.\n\nUpcoming Challenges and Opportunities\n\nWhile Pectra is a major step, it is only part of Ethereum\u2019s ambitious roadmap. Developers are already working on future improvements, such as the Osaka upgrade.\n\nPeerDAS will be integrated into Pectra to improve data availability on Ethereum. This improvement is crucial to strengthening the network\u2019s scalability and decentralization.\n\nThe Osaka upgrade, planned after Pectra, will include advanced features such as the implementation of Verkle Tree. This new data structure promises to further enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and security.\n\nThe Pectra update marks a new phase in Ethereum\u2019s evolution. By incorporating major technological innovations and improving user experience, Ethereum positions itself to remain at the forefront of the crypto revolution.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has finally broken through $70,000, setting itself up for further growth. As we can see, there is a good chance it will succeed at it, as the price is moving closer to $71,000 and trading volumes remain elevated.\n\nThis bullish momentum is easily visible on the daily chart of Bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar (BTC/USD). Bitcoin is currently trading around $70,977 with the price action showing a steady climb. A major turning point was reached recently when the market broke above $70,000, indicating fresh interest and optimism. This optimistic view is supported by several important technical indicators.\n\nThe 50-day and 200-day moving averages in particular are positioned in a way that indicates sustained upward momentum. A traditional bullish signal known as a golden cross formed when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average.\n\nVolume analysis supports this optimistic scenario even more. The recent price surge is accompanied by elevated trading volumes, indicating strong market participation and interest at these price points. Maintaining the present upward trend and possibly pushing Bitcoin above $71,000 require this volume support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore Bitcoin remains a favorable investment option given the current macroeconomic climate. Bitcoin's allure as a store of value and safeguard against the devaluation of fiat currencies is still great in light of persistent worries about economic stability.\n\nEthereum's weird position\n\nThe surge toward $3,800 was not expected by the market, yet we are here. However, Ethereum's activity raises a lot of questions as the asset's price is going through an extremely prolonged consolidation phase, and it is unclear whether or not it will come out as a winner from it.\n\nAfter the steep increase to $3,800, the price of Ethereum has been trapped in a narrow range, as can be seen by looking at the daily chart of ETH against the USD. When buyers and sellers are evenly matched, the market is usually in a state of indecision, as indicated by this sideways movement.\n\nEthereum has tested $3,750 several times without breaking below what appears to be the key support level. A number of technical indicators shed light on Ethereum's present situation. A golden cross, or the potential continuation of a bullish trend, could be indicated if the 50-day moving average, which is approaching the 200-day moving average, crosses above it. However, the market continues to be cautious until such a crossover occurs.\n\nFurther more, the fact that trading volumes have been comparatively low during this phase of consolidation suggests that a sizable portion of market participants are holding off until a more distinct trend becomes apparent.\n\nSolana's market position\n\nSolana's path on the market was tough in the last few weeks, but things are changing rapidly, with Bitcoin bouncing toward $70,000 and investors gaining some of that positive sentiment back. However, fundamentally, Solana might not be doing as well as it used to.\n\nSolana shows a gradual but consistent recovery. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are supporting the modest uptrend that Solana is currently showing at about $172. 92.\n\nThough technical indicators point to a bright future, the larger ecosystem surrounding Solana paints a different picture. The Solana meme coin scene used to be a hive of activity and creativity, but it is not as active as recently.\n\nThere has not been much buying interest in Solana, as seen by the low trading volume. This is concerning because price movements need to be supported and maintained by sustained volume, which is probably the biggest issue for it right now."

        "content": "VanEck projects Ethereum at $22,000 by 2030, fueled by ETF approval and institutional adoption.\n\nVanEck says ETH could hit $154,000 in a bullish market and fall to $360 in a bearish one.\n\nAfter days of anticipation, Bitcoin [BTC] surpassed the $70K milestone on 5th June. Mirroring this upward trend, Ethereum [ETH] experienced a 1.34% increase at the time of writing.\n\nIncreased institutional interest\n\nAmid the positive market momentum, VanEck, a prominent asset manager, projected that Ethereum will reach $22,000 per coin by 2030.\n\nThis bullish prediction is based on the anticipated approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), expected to take place in July.\n\nElaborating further on the matter, VanEck in its recent blog post noted,\n\n\u201cThis development would allow financial advisors and institutional investors to hold this unique asset with the security of qualified custodians, and benefit from the pricing and liquidity advantages characteristic of ETFs.\u201d\n\nSeeing such pros, VanEck updated its financial model to evaluate ETH\u2019s investment case. This potential market shift highlights the increasing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems.\n\nWhat are the metrics saying?\n\nThis sentiment was further confirmed by AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment data that revealed a hike in total supply in profits. As of the latest update, that number has risen to over 132 million.\n\nThis explains why VanEck views Ethereum as a gateway for investors that can tap into a rapidly expanding digital economy.\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s performance highlights impressive metrics, such as 20 million monthly active users, $4 trillion in transactions, and $5.5 trillion in yearly stablecoin transfers. It further added,\n\n\u201cThe centerpiece asset of this financial system is the ETH token, and in our updated base case, we believe it to be worth $22,000 by 2030, representing a total return of 487% from today\u2019s ETH price, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.8%.\u201d\n\nThis highlights that according to VanEck\u2019s analysts, the base case prediction for Ethereum is $22,000. They foresee the cryptocurrency reaching up to $154,000 in a bullish market and potentially falling to $360 in a bearish one.\n\nHow is the community reacting?\n\nInterestingly, the community also appeared to be optimistic about ETH\u2019s future, as noted by a well-known trader, Yoddha, who said,"

        "content": "Baby Doge, a unique cryptocurrency that draws inspiration from the popular meme crypto Dogecoin, has made a significant announcement, capturing the attention of the broader crypto market. The proposal to renounce ownership of the token contract on both Ethereum & BNB Chain, which was initially suggested on May 29, has been successfully passed today, June 6.\n\nThis momentous event has sent shockwaves through the global crypto landscape, sparking a flurry of discussions in the community. Let\u2019s delve deeper into the development that aims to aid Baby Doge to branch out to Ethereum and BNB Chain.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBaby Doge Multi-Chain Proposal Passes: What\u2019s The Scoop?\n\nZooming past to date, the voting has ended with the odds substantially tilted towards the proposal\u2019s passing. As per insights by \u2018snapshot.org,\u2019 the meme coin\u2019s voting results illustrate that the proposal gained 848 trillion votes, worth 99.53%, in favor, while 0.47%, worth 4 trillion votes, were against the development.\n\nThe voting started on May 29 and ended on June 05. According to Baby Doge\u2019s community\u2019s official announcement, this proposal\u2019s primary objectives include streamlining decentralization, security, and community trust, aligning with DeFi\u2019s true ethos.\n\nMeanwhile, the expected time for the renouncement process is approximately 1-2 weeks, \u2018including verification and community communication.\u2019 The completion of the process is expected to widen crypto\u2019s user appeal across the global crypto realm, potentially impacting price.\n\nAlso Read: 4 Must-Buy Gaming Crypto For Bullish June\n\nBabyDoge Price Jumps\n\nIn the interim, upon the news surfacing within the market, BabyDoge\u2019s price saw a 1.64% uptick in value in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.000000001968. The token appears to be witnessing an extended consolidation period, looking at broader time frame price charts. Its 24-hour lows and highs are $0.000000001913 and $0.000000001963, respectively.\n\nRenouncing ownership of the BabyDoge token contract on ETH and BNB Chain comes as a strategic mover to achieve complete decentralization and reinforce the crypto\u2019s commitment to transparency and security for users.

        "content": "Thu 06 Jun 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nApproved on May 24, Ethereum ETFs are about to transform the crypto investment landscape. According to K33 Research, these digital assets could generate up to $4 billion in the next five months.\n\nEthereum ETF Prediction\n\nThe reasons behind the potential of Ethereum ETFs\n\nMany cryptography experts expect Ethereum ETFs to follow the path paved by Bitcoin ETFs. Since their launch, the latter have experienced resounding success.\n\nAccording to K33 Research, this estimate is based on the relative market share of Ethereum assets under management compared to Bitcoin. It currently represents 28%. With institutional funds controlling 3.3% of the circulating ETH supply, K33 anticipates significant inflows. These would reach between $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion, or between 750,000 and 1 million ETH.\n\nDiscover our newsletter This link uses an affiliate program.\n\nComparison with Bitcoin ETFs\n\nEthereum ETFs are directly inspired by the Bitcoin ETF model. Since January, American Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed $13.9 billion. Globally, they control more than one million BTC. This represents over 5% of the circulating BTC supply.\n\nUsing this dynamic as a reference, forecasts for Ethereum ETFs seem promising. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, for example, anticipates returns between 10% and 20% of what Bitcoin ETFs have generated. \u201cRecovering 20% would be a huge win,\u201d he stated in a tweet.\n\nSuccess of Ethereum ETFs: What impact on the institutional market?\n\nEthereum ETFs are expected to strengthen Ethereum\u2019s position in the institutional market. ETH futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange already represent 23% of the size of Bitcoin. This reflects strong institutional demand.\n\nEuropean and Canadian funds also show a growing appetite for Ethereum ETFs. They hold about 1/3 of the assets under management compared to Bitcoin. This positive trend is expected to further stimulate institutional adoption of Ethereum.\n\nWith inflow predictions reaching up to $4 billion, Ethereum ETFs are thus positioned alongside Bitcoin as a pillar of crypto investments.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Why Ethereum struggles to rally even as Bitcoin surges past $70,000 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ethereum was trading in the $3,800 price zone at the time of this writing.\n\nETH was creating a string support for itself around this level.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] recently surpassed the $71,000 price mark, which typically shifts market focus to Ethereum [ETH]. An analysis showed that while ETH experienced a rally of its own, it was short-lived.\n\nEthereum fails to sustain momentum\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum on a daily timeframe chart revealed a slight positive movement at the end of trading on 4th June. The chart showed that ETH saw an increase of over 1%, bringing its price to around $3,810.\n\nAlthough modest, this move pushed ETH into the $3,800 price region for the first time in days and marked its first positive movement in three days. However, as of this writing, ETH has returned to a negative trend.\n\nAnalysis showed that, despite maintaining the $3,800 price range, Ethereum was trading with a decline of less than 1%.\n\nA study of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that it remained in a bull trend despite the recent poor price performance, with the RSI close to 65 at the time of writing.\n\nAdditionally, the $3,700 price range is emerging as the immediate support level, as the price has been consistently bouncing off this level since reaching it.\n\nEthereum volume shows positive signs\n\nAn analysis of Ethereum\u2019s volume showed a recovery since the start of the new month. Initially, the volume fell to around $9 billion, but it has gradually increased, recently reaching its highest point this month.\n\nBy the end of trading on 4th June, the volume was around $13.5 billion, and as of this writing, it has risen to over $14.6 billion. This increase in volume is a key metric to monitor when predicting the potential direction of Ethereum\u2019s price movement.\n\nWhile the price has not significantly increased yet, the rise in volume indicates heightened activity, which could influence the price movement.\n\nETH in profit sees a slight increase\n\nAnalysis of Ethereum\u2019s volume in profit revealed an increase of approximately 2 million ETH in the last 24 hours.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAccording to Santiment, at the end of trading on 4th July, the number of ETH in profit was around 129.5 million.\n\nAs of this writing, that number has risen to over 131 million. This increase means that the percentage of supply in profit has grown from about 93.4% to over 94%."

        "title": "Is Ethereum a Good Investment in 2024? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum has a lot going for it as we approach the halfway point of 2024. It's comfortably the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization and enjoys a lot of popularity in the community thanks to its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem. In addition, whether you\u2019re interested in swapping tokens, lending crypto, collecting NFTs or using stablecoins, chances are that the most exciting developments are happening on Ethereum first.\n\nIn addition to the general robustness of the Ethereum ecosystem, another thing that should make Ethereum investors happy is the fact that Ethereum will (very likely) soon be joining Bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency that can be traded via a spot ETF in the United States. This will give it that much more legitimacy among investors and streamline access for institutional investors.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at Ethereum from multiple angles to help you determine if Ethereum is a good investment in 2024 or not. First, we\u2019ll begin by listing various reasons why Ethereum might be a good investment in 2024. Of course, we\u2019ll consider some of the downsides of investing in ETH as well.\n\nKey highlights: Ethereum's robust ecosystem and smart contract capabilities make it the second-largest cryptocurrency with broad community support.\n\nThe upcoming potential approval of an Ethereum spot ETF in the US could enhance its legitimacy and attract institutional investors.\n\nDeflationary pressures from reduced ETH issuance post-Merge and the EIP-1559 mechanism enhance its attractiveness as a long-term investment.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are mitigating Ethereum's scalability issues, maintaining its dominance in the smart contracts and DeFi space.\n\nHere\u2019s why Ethereum is considered a good investment\n\nIn September 2022, pretty much every ETH investor and user held their breath as the network underwent its most significant upgrade ever \u2013 the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm \u2013 dubbed \u201cThe Merge.\u201d While the price of ETH plummeted ahead of the upgrade, with investors fearing that it could have an adverse impact on the network, the price quickly recovered after it became obvious that the transition was a total success.\n\nNow, with the uncertainty of the Merge ever more distant in the rearview, there are several reasons that make Ethereum a good investment in 2024, including:\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is increasing\n\nDeflationary pressures are making ETH more valuable\n\nLayer 2 solutions are successfully mitigating Ethereum\u2019s scalability issues\n\nEthereum is retaining its smart contract dominance\n\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why Ethereum is a good investment in more detail. We\u2019ll also present a case against Ethereum, so that you can get familiar with some of its drawbacks.\n\nA substantial amount of ETH is staked even before withdrawals are enabled\n\nAt the time of writing, 27.6 million ETH, or about 23% of the ETH supply, is locked in the staking deposit contract. This is impressive, given that staked ETH is worth over $100 billion and that users can withdraw it whenever they wish (barring a short queue list). It's worth noting that the ability to withdraw ETH has rolled out with the Shanghai update in early 2023.\n\nThe fact that tens of billion of dollars worth of ETH had been staked even before there was a mechanism to withdraw the coins indicates that Ethereum investors had a lot of confidence in the project\u2019s ability to execute its roadmap. Now, a year later, the total value of staked ETH jumped to over $100 billion, which is an even greater vote of confidence from the market.\n\nThe number of staked ETH. Image source: Nansen\n\nThe fact that you can stake ETH is also one reason that can make Ethereum a good investment. If you\u2019re looking to hold your ETH over the long term, you can currently enjoy an APY of about 3.3% on your staked coins. While these are not earth-shattering gains, it\u2019s better than earning no yield at all if you weren\u2019t planning to sell your ETH anyway.\n\nDeflationary pressure on ETH supply\n\nWhen the Merge was close to happening, much of the discussion in the cryptocurrency community (rightly) revolved around Ethereum moving over to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. However, there was one aspect of the Merge that perhaps got less attention than it deserves. Prior to the Merge, the Ethereum protocol issued about 13,000 ETH every day in order to reward miners. With the new Proof-of-Stake system, the protocol only needs to issue about 1,600 ETH per day to provide sufficient incentives to Proof-of-Stake validators to secure the network.\n\nThis change, combined with the EIP-1559 mechanism introduced in 2021, has actually turned ETH into a slightly deflationary cryptocurrency. According to ultrasound.money, the supply of ETH has decreased by a total of more than 400,000 ETH following the Merge.\n\nThis deflationary pressure to the supply of ETH has made it a more attractive hold over the long term, as ETH holders effectively no longer need to consider inflation as a factor that could negatively affect the value of their coins.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s not a certainty that ETH will remain deflationary, as this will depend on how much demand there is for transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. More demand for transactions equals more burned ETH, as the base transaction fees for each transaction are being burned thanks to EIP-1559. While the deflationary aspect is a nice bonus, Ethereum is one of the best long term cryptos to buy, regardless of whether its tokenomics are slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary.\n\nEthereum layer 2s are making good progress\n\nIt\u2019s not secret that the current iteration of Ethereum has major problems with scalability. In 2021, when the crypto market was in the middle of a raging bull run, transaction fees on the Ethereum network skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. At points, users were paying north of $50 just to make a single transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis is obviously not a sustainable situation if Ethereum is to become a widely adopted network. Thankfully, there are several solutions in sight. The Ethereum protocol itself will receive upgrades in the future, most notably sharding, which will allow it to process more transactions while keeping costs lower.\n\nIn addition to improvements on the protocol base layer, there are also a number of layer 2 scalability solutions that leverage the security of the Ethereum mainnet while processing transactions off-chain to keep costs low.\n\nThere\u2019s already a number of layer 2 platforms for Ethereum available. The most notable examples are Arbitrum One and Optimism, which are both based on optimistic rollup technology and offer much better transaction efficiency for the end user than the base layer.\n\nEthereum continues to dominate the smart contracts space\n\nThere\u2019s a slew of Ethereum competitors available on the market. Many alternative layer 1 chains have adopted the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), while others like Solana, Cardano and Aptos have taken completely different approaches.\n\nIn any case, no other blockchain has come even close to challenging Ethereum as the most popular platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are the main reasons why it tops the list of best altcoins to buy. According to DeFi Llama, Ethereum has a 60% market share in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, according to the TVL (total value locked) metric. The next closest competitor, TRON, has a market share of about 7.2%.\n\nDeFi TVL market share among all blockchains. Image source: DeFi Llama\n\nThe demand for using the Ethereum network is also evident based on the total fees paid to use it. As of early June 2024, users are paying a total of $9.6 million in fees daily for Ethereum transactions, according to data from cryptofees.info. Bitcoin is in second place with a daily average of $4.1 million in total daily fees.\n\nETH is still down from its all-time high\n\nEven though ETH kicked off 2024 with a rally, the Ethereum price is still down about 22% from its all-time high. This could make ETH a good investment at the moment, as it has already displayed the ability to reach higher prices in the past. In addition, several other major cryptos, including Bitcoin, BNB, and Toncoin, have managed to clinch new all-time high valuations this year, so Ethereum could be next.\n\nAs a side note, even if Ethereum were to surpass its previous ATH, there is virtually no chance that it could explode by 100x or post similarly impressive gains \u2013 its current market cap is just too large and the growth required to post triple or four digit gains is just not feasible.\n\nDespite being constrained from benefiting from 100x price increases, the 5-year Ethereum average return rate would still net investors an incredibly handsome sum in the span of 10 years, mostly due to the magic of compounding interest. Here\u2019s how a $5,000 investment in Ethereum with a monthly contribution of $100 would fare over the next 10 years, if we take the compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of ETH in the past 3 years as a basis.\n\nA $5,000 investment in Ethereum (with a $100 monthly contribution) in 2024 will grow to nearly $33,000 by 2034 if we assume Ethereum\u2019s CAGR over the past 3 years. Source: Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nWhat are the cons of Ethereum as an investment?\n\nHopefully, we have demonstrated that Ethereum has a lot going for it as an investment in 2024. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that buying ETH is a sure bet.\n\nWhile layer 2 solutions promise to address Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes, they are still in their relatively early stages, with many taking compromises in terms of decentralization. Meanwhile, the Ethereum mainnet is still very expensive to use.\n\nAt the time of writing, a simple token swap will cost about $3.9 in fees, which makes it very difficult to portray Ethereum as a platform that targets a broad audience and enables financial inclusion. In addition, the fees get substantially higher whenever there is a surge in demand.\n\nIn addition, the macroeconomic situation might also not bode well for cryptocurrencies. After all, some economists are predicting a recession to happen in 2024. If these predictions materialize, the cryptocurrency market will be in uncharted territory, as it has never existed amid a global recession\u2014let\u2019s remember that Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and only became a significant asset a few years later.\n\nDepending on the severity of this expected recession, there could be a sell-off in the crypto markets due to investors getting rid of their risky assets, and ETH would undoubtedly also be impacted in such a scenario.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that even though Ethereum is among the most established crypto projects, ETH is still a highly volatile asset when compared to traditional investments. Before buying any cryptocurrency, make sure to carefully consider your financial situation and never invest more than you are willing to lose.\n\nEthereum price prediction for 2024: A new ATH brewing on the horizon?\n\nOur algorithm forecasts Ethereum price to increase by +260% and reach a new ATH in early 2024.\n\nAccording to our Ethereum price prediction, the price of Ethereum will see a nice uptick in the second half of 2024. The world\u2019s largest altcoin is expected to start mounting a rally late in July, culminating in a new all-time high of roughly $5,450 in December.\n\nThe Ethereum price prediction is based on the snapshot of technical indicators in early June 2024, with 28 indicators signaling bullish and 2 bearish signals. Keep in mind that the prediction could change considerably going forward if the underlying indicators change.\n\nThe bottom line: The future of Ethereum looks bright, but the macro environment could spoil the party\n\nIf you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cShould I buy Ethereum?\u201d the current situation might be a good time to do so. As we can see, there are a lot of positive indications for the future of Ethereum that could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.\n\nA large number of ETHs are being staked even before the launch of withdrawals. EIP-1559 and the Merge have combined to drastically reduce the issuance of ETH, and Ethereum is continuing to dominate the smart contracts sector. In addition, ETH is trading below considerably its all-time highs while Bitcoin, BNB, and some other top coins are trading at the top, which means the current prices could represent an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nIn addition, the expected approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in the US in the near term could provide another boost that could push Ethereum above its previous highs.\n\nFor more information, check out our ultimate guide on cryptocurrency investing for useful tips and ideas on how to approach investing in crypto."

        "content": "As many assets in the cryptocurrency market start to resume their price increases, the sector\u2019s largest altcoin \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 has been one of them, and machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are fairly optimistic about its progress for the next several weeks.\n\nIndeed, Ethereum has been riding the current bullish wave in the crypto sphere, heightened by the exceptionally positive prediction by investment giant VanEck, which sees the second largest asset in the cryptoverse by market capitalization, reaching a whopping $22,000 by 2030.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nIn terms of its price prognosis for the near future, Ethereum might hit the level at $3,927.66 by as early as June 30, 2024, according to the advanced AI algorithm deployed by the crypto monitoring and forecasting platform PricePredictions retrieved by Finbold on June 6.\n\n30-day Ethereum price prediction chart.

        "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nEthereum is holding gains above the $3,700 support zone.\n\nETH/USD cleared a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,800 on the daily chart.\n\nThe price could gain bullish momentum once it clears the $4,000 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum price\n\nNEW DELHI (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Ethereum (ETH) is again moving higher above $3,800. ETH might surge over 10% if it settles above the $3,950 and $4,000 levels.\n\nEthereum Price Eyes More Upsides\n\nAfter a strong rally after the ETH ETF approval, the bears defended more upsides above the $4,000 resistance. Ethereum saw a minor pullback from the $3,975 zone like Bitcoin. The price dipped below the $3,920 and $3,880 levels.\n\nETH tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,870 swing low to the $3,975 high. However, the bulls were active above the $3,700 zone and the price remained well above the 50-day simple moving average (blue).\n\nEthereum price daily chart | Source: ETH/USD on TradingView.com\n\nRecently, Ethereum started another increase from the $3,700 zone. There was a move above the $3,780 and $3,800 resistance levels. Besides, it cleared a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $3,800 on the daily chart.\n\nThese are positive signs and suggest a high chance of more upsides. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,900 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,950 level.\n\nThe main resistance could be $4,000. A clear move above the $4,000 resistance could spark another increase. In the stated case, the price might recover and test the $4,080 resistance. The next major resistance is visible near the $4,250 level.\n\nA successful daily close above the $4,250 resistance could send Ether toward $4,400. Any more gains might initiate a move toward the $5,000 zone in the near term.\n\nAnother Downside Correction In ETH?\n\nConversely, Ethereum might start another downside correction. The first major support sits near the $3,700 level. If there is a downside break below the $3,700 support zone, there is a risk of a larger pullback. In the stated case, the price might test the $3,550 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,870 swing low to the $3,975 high at $3,420. A downside break and a daily close below $3,420 might call for a test of the $3,300 support and the 50-day simple moving average (blue).\n\nOverall, Ethereum price is holding gains above $3,720 and $3,700. If ETH clears the $4,000 resistance, there could be a fresh surge in the near term."
