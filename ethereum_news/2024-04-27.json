        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the top 15 Ethereum competitors and alternatives in 2024. If you want to skip our analysis about some of the key players in the cryptocurrency market, you can proceed to the section highlighting the Top 5 Ethereum Competitors and Alternatives in 2024.\n\nThe Global Cryptocurrency Market and a Comparison of Giants\n\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market was valued at $4.67 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5% from 2023 to 2030, to reach $11.71 billion by the end of the forecasted period. You can also take a look at 15 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two most traded cryptocurrencies in the world. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum utilize blockchain technology, however, they have different purposes and technical architectures. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralized digital currency primarily tailored for peer-to-peer digital transactions without the involvement of financial institutions. Bitcoin emphasizes security, and scarcity with its blockchain optimized primarily for monetary transactions. Bitcoin is powered by the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and operates on the SHA-256 hash algorithm, Bitcoin has the highest market capitalization among all cryptocurrencies, valued at over $1.3 trillion on April 14. However, its smart contract capabilities are limited compared to Ethereum. You can 15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal.\n\nEthereum on the other hand was launched in 2015 and is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications that empowers developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements encoded in code. Examples of decentralized apps that can be built on Ethereum include tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges. Tokens are interchangeable digital assets that represent value on a blockchain. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, non-interchangeable tokens that represent ownership of digital items such as art, collectibles, or virtual real estate. Decentralized finance (DeFi) apps are blockchain-based financial applications that operate without centralized intermediaries, Lending protocols are DeFi apps that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies, which often use NFTs as collateral and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner, without any intermediaries. As of April 14, Ethereum has a market cap of over $386 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum charges a fee for transactions and smart contracts on its blockchain network known as Gas which is paid entirely in Ethereum coins. Gas is measured by the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract, the more complex the execution operation is, the more Gas is required to fulfill that operation, and can vary from time to time depending on the network\u2019s demand. Gas fees for Ethereum transactions can range from $0.0001 to over $100, depending on the blockchain\u2019s demand.\n\nKey Players in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nCompanies offering user-friendly cryptocurrency exchange platforms and providing services such as trading, lending, and wallets have contributed significantly to the growth of the cryptocurrency market and have also established themselves as key players in the digital finance industry. Some of the largest companies offering platforms and wallets for the cryptocurrency market include Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN), Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ).\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform and is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States in terms of trading volume. On April 3 Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) announced that it had obtained registration as a Restricted Dealer by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), making it the first and largest international cryptocurrency exchange registered in Canada. The registration marks a significant milestone in Coinbase Global Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:COIN) commitment to the Canadian market, following its Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking in March 2023 for regulatory compliance and formally launching its services back in August 2023. Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) plans to establish partnerships with local financial institutions and stakeholders in Canada to encourage the adoption of digital assets and promote economic development. On April 11 Coinbase Global Inc. (NYSE:COIN) announced the launch of margined Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin futures contracts by Coinbase Derivatives, making it the first CFTC-regulated exchange to offer such contracts. Dogecoin futures contracts are also expected to launch later this month. Coinbase Derivatives aims to improve access to digital asset trading by reducing upfront capital requirements and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) provides a user-friendly platform that can be used to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies. On March 19, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) announced its official launch in the United Kingdom and offered key features and benefits for investors including options trading, 5% AER (Annual Equivalent Rate) on uninvested cash, access to over 6,000 global companies, commission-free trading, and no foreign exchange fees on trades, in comparison to the significant fees charged by other UK brokers. On February 29, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) announced its collaboration with Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution that will give Robinhood Wallet users access to Arbitrum swaps through decentralized exchanges. Robinhood Wallet users can now benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction speeds on some of the most prominent networks in the cryptocurrency market. Over the next few months, Robinhood and Arbitrum will also collaborate to facilitate access to cross-chain swaps and other initiatives that are aimed at lowering the barriers to using web3 on Robinhood Wallet. Commenting on the event, Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Markets, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:HOOD) Crypto Divison said:\n\n\u201cEthereum gas fees are an essential part of securing the network, but these same fees can hinder adoption, Layer 2s like Arbitrum, which is currently the leading chain by total-locked value, help solve this problem for our users. Accessing and transacting on L2s has historically been difficult to non-crypto natives, but Robinhood Wallet now helps strip away the complexities to help onboard those new to web3.\u201d\n\nBlock, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Square, Inc. is a global technology company with a focus on financial services and owns Square, Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD. On December 07, 2023, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) launched Bitkey a self-custody cryptocurrency wallet in over 95 countries across six continents that consists of three components: a mobile app for seamless transactions on smartphones, a hardware device for securely storing cryptocurrencies offline, and a set of recovery tools in case customers lose their phone, hardware, or both. Unlike traditional self-custody wallets, Bitkey uses three keys to secure cryptocurrencies: one integrated into the mobile application, another in the hardware device, and the third stored on Bitkey\u2019s server. Any two keys can be used to move cryptocurrencies or approve other security-related actions such as initiating recovery or modifying security settings. Bitkey has also partnered with prominent platforms like Coinbase and Cash App, enabling seamless transfers of cryptocurrencies from exchanges to the Bitkey wallet.\n\nEthereum's decentralized platform not only facilitates digital transactions but has also transformed the landscape of decentralized applications as they operate on a distributed network of servers and are not prone to censorship and fraudulent activities. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, innovations in blockchain technology will further expand the possibilities within the cryptocurrency industry. With this context, let\u2019s take a look at the list of the top 15 Ethereum competitors and alternatives in 2024.

        "content": "The listing represents a preliminary step in the trading process, yet it does not ensure that the SEC will grant approval for the fund.\n\nShare this article\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s proposed spot Ethereum ETF has appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation\u2019s (DTCC) new securities list with the ticker EZET. This development occurred just a day following reports of the SEC\u2019s probable rejection of spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nThe DTCC listing represents a preliminary step in the trading process, yet it does not ensure that the SEC will approve the Ether Spot ETF. The SEC\u2019s decision on the fund remains pending.\n\nFranklin Templeton filed for spot Ethereum ETF in February, joining other industry giants like BlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK Invest, in the race. However, the outlook for Ethereum-based funds is not as promising as it was for Bitcoin-based predecessors.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimates there is only a 25% chance of SEC approval for a spot Ethereum ETF. He cites a noticeable absence of engagement from the SEC, contrasting with the Bitcoin ETF approval process. Balchunas interprets this silence as a deliberate \u2018tactical\u2019 decision rather than mere \u2018procrastination.\u2019\n\nJPMorgan analysts anticipate a protracted delay in the regulatory approval of the spot Ethereum ETF, though they suggest that approval could eventually follow a legal challenge similar to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit, which compelled the SEC to reassess spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s market performance has stagnated post-Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving, with its price staying between $3,100 and $3,200, according to CoinGecko. At press time, Ethereum is trading at around $3,100, down 1% in 24 hours."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nBinance has experienced significant outflows: 14,146 ETH, valued at approximately $46.74 million, within 24 hours. Notably, a fresh wallet also extracted 95.67 million USDT along with 7,402 ETH, equating to around $23.3 million. The activity mirrors the withdrawal patterns of two other wallets known for moving large quantities of ETH and stablecoins off the platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe smart money tracking service Lookonchain even raised a question: Could these transactions be linked to Justin Sun, known for his substantial funds movements, or are they simply routine redistributions? While the identity of the wallet owners remains unconfirmed, the movement of such large sums is not necessarily an alarm signal. It is often a simple transfer of funds.\n\nRecently, Binance has been witnessing continuous outflows and a dip in market share. This could suggest a trend of whales gradually reducing their presence on the exchange. It is important to consider these movements within the market's current tendencies.\n\nEthereum price chart suggests the second-biggest currency is currently in a mixed position. Ethereum's price appears to be consolidating with current support at the $2,900 level. If there is a potential growth scenario toward resistance at $3,400, ETH would need to maintain the current pace. A break beyond that could see Ethereum challenging higher levels, possibly around the $3,650 mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, if support at $2,900 is breached, Ethereum might face a slide toward the next support region near $2,800. Whales' actions, like those possibly associated with Justin Sun, can influence market sentiment, but the price chart suggests a steadiness that may not be easily swayed by individual transactions, regardless of their size.\n\nWhile the outflows from Binance and market share reduction could be part of a funds redistribution by large-scale investors, Ethereum's technical indicators and support levels remain mixed."

The goal behind this is to ensure that Ethereum remains a vibrant and indispensable blockchain platform and to preserve access for the countless developers, market participants, and institutions\u2026 \u2014 Consensys (@Consensys) April 25, 2024\n\nIndustry leaders immediately took to Twitter to vocally support the suit, castigating the SEC for potentially attempting to effectively outlaw Ethereum after several other American government entities have indicated that ETH is not within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nI know ETH is a commodity. You know ETH is a commodity. The CFTC knows ETH is a commodity. It's time for the SEC to admit that it still knows ETH is a commodity too. No more games. Thank you to @Consensys for standing up against the SEC's unlawful expansion of authority. https://t.co/8w7A4PBwUK \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHayden Adams, founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap, likened the suit to a battle cry for the crypto industry to finally take an aggressive, collective stance against the SEC in a Lord of the Rings-esque battle.

        "title": "Is Ethereum responsible for the delay in altcoin season? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The Altcoin Season Index at 35 suggested that the many tokens were not out of depression.\n\nA decline in ETH\u2019s network growth and volume might hinder the upswing.\n\nIf there is one phrase that has been trending in the market for months without almost nothing to show, it\u2019s \u201caltcoin season.\u201d\n\nFor the anticipated period to come to life, Ethereum [ETH] and other non-Bitcoin [BTC] cryptocurrencies have to outperform BTC.\n\nBut that has not happened. In fact, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Blockchaincenter.net revealed that the time was not close. According to the platform, the Altcoin Season Index was at 35.\n\nAlts fails to sustain the preview\n\nTo confirm an altcoin season, the reading has to be at 75. Interestingly, the index hit this height in the last week of January, and the first week of March. But it melted away within days.\n\nA look at tokens like ETH, Cardano [ADA], and Ripple [XRP] showed that their prices decreased in the last 90 days. Unless 75% of the top 50 cryptos outperform BTC, there will be no altcoins season.\n\nConsidering the press time circumstances, one can assume that the period was not close. Apart from the index, one factor that could determine is ETH.\n\nIn 2021, the surge in Ethereum was one of the first movers that activated the price increase that many altcoins experienced.\n\nNotably, less than 20 altcoins out of the top 50 have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days.\n\nBut ETH was not part of them. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has not been able to make the kind of moves it did in the last bull market.\n\nETH dashes the hope\n\nHowever, if demand for ETH surges, the condition might change, and the price of the token might climb to test its all-time high. For this to take place, a lot of new addresses have to come into the Ethereum network.\n\nTo track this, AMBCrypto looked at network growth. At press time, network growth on Ethereum was 3131, suggesting that the adoption of the cryptocurrency has been unimpressive.\n\nIf the metric continues to decline, ETH\u2019s price might find it challenging to move northward. In this case, altcoin season might continue to be delayed.\n\nOn the other hand, a surge in network growth might spark a rally for the cryptocurrency and other top tokens. In the meantime, an assessment of the volume showed that it was $10.31 billion.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAt the beginning of ETH\u2019s rise to its all-time high, the volume was over $40 billion. Rising volume indicates interest in a cryptocurrency. If consistent, it could lead to higher prices.\n\nWith the low volume, a notable price increase for the altcoin could be unlikely over the next few weeks. In addition, altcoins might need to look away from waiting for ETH before going on months-long rallies."

This week, heavy selling of BTC options has seen the vol curve collapse, with Bitcoin vols further compressing from 70% to 50%. The company added that if people are looking to buy BTC and ETH, then this consolidating market is the best time to accumulate longs.\n\nOther the other side, the downside skew in Ethereum (ETH) risk reversals has also dropped further to -13%, said QCP Capital. This could be due to recent reports of SEC possibly denying or further delaying spot Ether ETF. According to people familiar with the matter, the SEC and its staff have shown no interest in the spot Ether ETF and its potential.

However, this attempt resulted in a significant correction.\n\nMajor headwinds\n\nEthereum's price recovery came despite the fact that Consensys, the key backer of the second-largest cryptocurrency network, recently sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after receiving a Wells notice from the regulator.\n\nThe SEC wants to expand its jurisdiction by classifying the flagship altcoin as a security, the firm alleges.\n\nConsensys has already hired some of the best lawyers from Manhattan-based firm Watchtell, meaning that the industry is about to witness another contentious legal battle.\n\nMoreover, some analysts believe that the SEC could potentially face another lawsuit from Grayscale over its refusal to approve a slew of spot Ethereum ETFs in May."

This led to Layer 2 chains and scaling solutions developing alternatives for users looking to transact at a lower cost.\n\nThe issue seems to have de-escalated with Ethereum\u2019s average fee level dipping to $1.12 per network transaction. This is one of the lowest levels noted since October 18.\n\nEthereum transaction fee declines\n\nData from Ultrasound Money shows that Ether\u2019s circulating supply has surged, climbing to the highest level witnessed since March. A little over 120 million Ether is in circulation now and the sharp increase in supply can be attributed to the consistent decline in burn rate, in the past two weeks.\n\nGas fees is currently 7.19 Gwei, up from a low value of 4.48 Gwei, as seen on Ultrasound.money. Gas fees is currently $0.62, as seen in YCharts, down from the May 2023 peak of $3.788.\n\nEthereum gas fees\n\nThe Ethereum supply chart shows inflation, and the recent increase sprung on ETH holders as a surprise, after five months of steady deflation. The ETH supply chart below shows the sudden increase in supply.\n\nETH supply\n\nThese catalysts have failed to have a significant impact on Ether price. The altcoin has sustained above $3,200 on Sunday, after relatively less significant moves since the Bitcoin halving. ETH holders are awaiting the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision on Spot Ether ETF and this is likely to emerge as the most significant catalyst for Ethereum."

        "content": "Consensys sued the SEC in Texas over Ether\u2019s classification\n\nOrg has challenged the SEC\u2019s allegations, while advocating for fairness and clarity\n\nWith the debate around Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] possible classification as a security becoming long and tiresome, Consensys, a blockchain software giant, recently made news. It did so by taking a bold step and initiating legal action against the United States\u2019s SEC and its five commissioners.\n\nLaura Brookover\u2019s insights\n\nRemarking on the same, Laura Brookover, Senior Counsel & Head of Litigation and Investigations at Consensys, on a recent episode of \u201cUnchained,\u201d claimed,\n\n\u201cI never expected to one day be suing the SEC, but here we are. We\u2019ve sued the SEC in our home state of Texas to defend Ether and the Ethereum network from Chair Gensler\u2019s unlawful power grab.\u201d\n\nShe added,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really time they saw the light of day because these are important critical issues for our industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to the exec, the SEC is not only targeting Consensys\u2019s product \u2013 Metamask, but also their finance team. They are doing so by asking about the sales of Ether and Ethereum developers.\n\nShe went on to say,\n\n\u201cIf Chair Gensler gets away with misclassifying Ether as a security it\u2019s really catastrophic in the United States.\u201d\n\nConsensys\u2019s defense mechanism\n\nWhile highlighting the fundamental differences between proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms, Consensys has consistently refuted the SEC\u2019s potential theory that staking turns Ether into a security. In fact, Brookover went on to challenge the SEC\u2019s differentiation between Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ecosystems, claiming,\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no reason to treat them differently, it\u2019s arbitrary. So, I think that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ll probably point to, as showing that the SEC really has no basis here.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not how everyone feels though. For instance, according to crypto-lawyer Bill Morgan,\n\nOn the contrary, Steven Nerayoff, a former Ethereum advisor, believes that Ethereum has functioned as a centralized entity since its ICO and thus, warrants classification as a security. He added,\n\n\u201cThis move is to distract people from the truth and just another cover-up.\u201d\n\nThe Wells Notice\n\nWhile discussing the SEC\u2019s Wells notice targeting Consensys for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities broker, Brookover highlighted Consensys\u2019s metamask swaps and staking features. In contesting this accusation, she argued that Metamask serves as a communication tool for liquid staking protocols, rather than engaging in securities distribution.\n\nErgo, Brookover is optimistic that a successful outcome in the lawsuit would provide much-needed clarity to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies."

Soon after, however, the altcoin turned bearish as ETH was unable to hold its position on the charts. Given how everything has panned out, if the worst scenario is to be considered here, ETH might fall to its $2.7k support level.\n\nMore red for Ethereum\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH\u2019s price appreciated by 2% last week, allowing it to go past $3.2k on 24 April. However, the uptrend didn\u2019t last long as its price dropped over the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,118.13 with a market capitalization of over $380 billion.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, 79% of Ethereum investors are still in profit. The decline in ETH\u2019s price also affected its social volume negatively. Additionally, after a spike on 25 April, its weighted sentiment dropped on the charts. This alluded to bearish sentiment around ETH being on the higher side.\n\nThings can get worse, however, as if ETH records more price corrections, its value might drop to the $2.7k support level in the coming days, as per a recent tweet from Crypto Tony, a popular crypto analyst. The possibility of ETH hitting that support level would increase if it fails to go above $3.6k.\n\nTherefore, AMBCrypto took a look at Santiment\u2019s data to see whether metrics seemed bearish.\n\nWe found that selling pressure on the token has been increasing. This was evidenced by the hike in its exchange inflows over the past week. The fact that selling pressure was high was further proven by ETH\u2019s supply on exchanges, which rise.\n\nOn the contrary however, whales remain confident in ETH as its supply held by top addresses went up.\n\nEthereum\u2019s immediate support levels\n\nAMBCrypto then checked ETH\u2019s daily chart to find whether a sustained downtrend is inevitable or not. We found that the Money Flow Index (MFI) went north \u2013 A sign predicting a price uptick.\n\nNonetheless, the rest of the indicators seemed bearish. For instance, both ETH\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) headed south, meaning that the chances of a further price drop were high.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nFinally, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital\u2019s data revealed that ETH has a strong support level near $3.1k if a price correction happens.\n\nA drop below that level could result in ETH plummeting to $2.8k before it reaches its tested support level at $2.7k in the coming days or weeks."

However, as per recent data, other blockchains like Ethereum [ETH] and BNB Chain have emerged to overtake its levels over the last few days. While this shift happened, DOT\u2019s price action turned bearish on the charts.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s development activity drops\n\nCoin98 Analytics recently shared a tweet mentioning a list of blockchains ranked in terms of their development activity. As per the tweet, Polkadot registered 827 developers last week, with the blockchain witnessing over 5000 weekly code commits.\n\nThough the number by itself wasn\u2019t low, it was lower than other blockchains. For instance, ETH had more than 2000 weekly developers who executed over 19,000 commits. Polkadot was also behind BNB Chain, whose weekly commits exceeded 6,000.\n\nOther blockchains that outshined DOT were Polygon [MATIC] and Optimism [OP], whose weekly commits stood at 6,300 and 5,200, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data also revealed a similar story. We found that DOT\u2019s development activity dropped sharply over the last seven days. However, despite the drop in dev activity, the blockchain\u2019s dev activity contributor count spiked multiple times last week.\n\nHere, it is interesting to note that while the blockchain\u2019s dev activity fell, its network activity registered a massive spike last week.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Artemis\u2019 data revealed that after several days of dormancy, DOT\u2019s daily active addresses shot up considerably on 24 April. Thanks to the rise in active addresses, its daily transaction count also followed a similar trend.\n\nBears are attacking DOT\n\nIn the meantime, Polkadot bears buckled up as the token\u2019s price dipped on the charts. According to CoinMarketCap, DOT lost more than 1.5% of its value in the last seven days. In fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s value dipped by 2%. At press time, DOT was trading at $6.70 with a market capitalization of over $9.6 billion.\n\nDOT\u2019s funding rate has risen over the last few days too. This is a bearish development as prices tend to move in the opposite direction from the funding rate.\n\nNonetheless, Polkadot\u2019s open interest also went down. A decline in the metric is a sign that chances of the ongoing market trend changing are high.\n\nRead Polkadot\u2019s [DOT] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nDOT\u2019s Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick and was heading further above the neutral level, suggesting a possible price hike.\n\nFinally, as per the Bollinger Bands, DOT\u2019s price was resting under its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A successful breakout above that level could result in a fresh bull run for the altcoin on the charts."
