        "title": "How Green Is Ethereum? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Ethereum's update in September 2022 was called the Merge. Developers integrated the long-anticipated transition to proof-of-stake in this update (among other issues) significantly reducing the blockchain's energy requirement. The new Ethereum chain, which was called Ethereum 2.0 until the Ethereum Foundation requested that it not be, reduced energy use and promised faster transactions and lower gas fees. Read on to discover how green Ethereum is and learn about its plans that may be even more environmentally friendly.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The Ethereum blockchain upgrade was called the Merge.\n\nThe upgrade enhanced the network and reduced energy consumption.\n\nIts proof-of-stake validation mechanism is more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work mechanisms.\n\nGas fees fell after the Merge (not because of it), but they aren't as low as from 2017 to 2020.\n\nThe Merge set the stage for further scalability enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nEthereum and Energy Use\n\nEthereum is a software platform that is open to anyone. It is commonly associated with ether (ETH), a cryptocurrency that is bought and sold by investors. Ethereum can be used by anyone for different reasons, including banking and finance, network and application building, and peer-to-peer financial networking without the need for middlemen.\n\nEthereum was created in 2013 and launched two years later by Vitalik Buterin. It is among the most well-known names in the cryptocurrency markets, coming in as the second-largest by market capitalization after Bitcoin. As of May 27, 2024, Ethereum's market cap was $466.67 billion. But, Ethereum mining is no longer possible after the move from the proof-of-work (PoW) model to proof-of-stake (PoS). Proof-of-stake reduced the blockchain's energy use by more than 99%.\n\nPoS differs from PoW in that it is not a network-wide competitive process of encrypting information through a hashing algorithm. PoS still uses a hashing algorithm and verifies transactions through a consensus layer, but the validators are randomly chosen by the network based on the amount of ether they have staked. Staking means offering ether as collateral to become a network validator so the participant can earn ether rewards.\n\nSelecting one semi-trusted validator to hash the information in a block and verify it uses far less energy than a competition. So, Ethereum is much more green in terms of energy consumption than it used to be.\n\nWere Ethereum Gas Fees Reduced?\n\nTransaction fees rose on the Ethereum network in 2020 because of increased network activity. At the time, the transactions of originators who offered the most in fees were placed in front of those who paid less. This created a fee war of sorts, with users trying to get their transactions validated quicker and miners charging more for prime validation spots.\n\nAn earlier attempt to fix rising costs tried to remove the transaction auction mentality from the network by imposing a base fee and a priority fee. The priority fee is similar to a tip to validators for them to choose to process one transaction instead of another. This was ineffective at lowering transaction fees because users still increased their tips to get transactions approved faster.\n\nEthereum is on its way to becoming a greener blockchain and network. Future upgrades are expected to make it more efficient, scalable, and less costly.\n\n\n\nEthereum Transaction Speeds\n\nThe Merge, which was an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain to a different version set the stage for future upgrades. Many people called the upgrade Ethereum 2.0, It was the most significant update to the system. Although it didn't improve transaction speeds at the time or even a few years later, future upgrades will introduce improvements in network speed and scalability.\n\nIs Ethereum Green?\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the blockchain and network consume 0.0026 terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr). This translates to the equivalent of 870 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Compare this to Bitcoin's 149 TWh/yr and global data centers' 190 TWh/yr. Ethereum also consumes less energy than video gaming in the U.S. (34 TWh/yr) and less than Google (19 TWh/yr).\n\nThe University of Cambridge's Judge Business School researched the energy sources for the Ethereum network after the Merge. According to its findings, 48% of Ethereum's energy comes from sustainable sources like wind power, nuclear power, and other renewables. The remaining 52% is powered by natural gas (30%), coal (19%), and oil (3%).\n\nAccording to similar reports, Ethereum is greener than it was before switching to PoS. However, there are many more upgrades planned that have the potential to make it even more efficient and eco-friendly.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing of eight new spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in May 2024. Trading will take place on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE BZX. There is no initial trading date as of yet, as the SEC is still working on final approvals. The move follows the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January 2024\u2014three years after Bitcoin futures ETFs were launched.\n\nThe Green Future of Ethereum\n\nEthereum has plans for upgrades to bring a new concept to the blockchain, which is expected to allow it to scale and increase transaction processing speeds. In March 2024, the Dencun Upgrade was released.\n\nThis upgrade introduced proto-danksharding, a process where second-layer rollup providers can send Binary Objects (also known as blobs) to the Ethereum main chain. Blobs are much cheaper to send than rollups, so transaction fees are expected to drop when full danksharding is released.\n\nThe full upgrade to danksharding is expected to allow Ethereum to scale up to more than 100,000 transactions per second and be cheaper, both of which will contribute to its greenness.\n\nFuture upgrades will address issues regarding:\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nDecentralization\n\nProtocol risks from Maximal Extractable Value\n\nBlock verification\n\nComputational costs\n\nMaximal Extractable Value is the maximum amount of value a validator or miner can get from a block in excess of the block reward and usual fees.\n\nThe lesser the blockchain costs, the more decentralized it becomes and the more efficient it will be. However, there are concerns whether decentralized applications built on Ethereum will consume more energy. Ethereum has positioned itself as the platform of choice for Web3 development.\n\nWeb3 is a concept of restructuring the backend of the internet, where control of people's information, data, and digital creations are returned to them. Many steps must be taken and hurdles overcome before blockchain technology can be used to create the new internet infrastructure conceived by developers.\n\nIf Ethereum is the platform used to create applications for this emerging and in-development restructuring, its eco-friendlier network might not be as environmentally friendly. However, it could be even more so\u2014there is no way to tell.\n\n\n\nDoes Ethereum Use Energy? Yes, Ethereum uses energy. It is a blockchain, a distributed ledger secured by cryptography, which requires energy to run and use.\n\nIs Ethereum Environmentally Friendly? Ethereum's carbon footprint is much less than it was before September 2022 but it still uses energy. Nearly half of its network is located in developed areas that use sustainable energy sources. About 30% of the remaining half is powered by natural gas, 10% by coal, and 3% by oil.\n\nHow Much Energy Did Ethereum Use Before the Merge? According to data from the University of Cambridge's Sustainability Index, Ethereum used about 21.41 THh of electricity per year and released 10.26 million tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFor Ethereum, the evolution to a better-performing, more accessible network has begun. Continued updates promise to cut back on emissions and make the network more energy-efficient while improving speeds and cutting transaction costs. However, Ethereum has much ground to cover to get to the levels of efficiency it wants, both in speed and environmental friendliness."

        "title": "Ethereum and Bitcoin are holding us back - Blockworks",
        "content": "The year is 2024, and the fast-paced realm of crypto shows no signs of slowing. Innovation is the name of the game, and monolithic blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin still reign supreme.\n\nBut as someone who\u2019s been knee-deep in the trenches of blockchain development, I can\u2019t help but wonder if these behemoths are really cutting it anymore. Herein lies my thesis:\n\nModular blockchains are the disruptors poised to revolutionize scalability and creativity towards the next Cambrian explosion of Web3 products as we know them.\n\nAs engineers and product developers, it\u2019s time to embrace specialized tools for specialized tasks and leave the one-size-fits-all approach behind. This isn\u2019t to say that prior layer-1s haven\u2019t paved the way for some incredible innovations, but attempting to scale legacy layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin has proven inefficient and counterproductive. They\u2019re dragging us down, like trying to sprint through quicksand.\n\nBlockchain researchers have grappled with the challenge of creating the optimal system for years. Many architectures attempted to accommodate all users on a single chain or a tightly coupled group of chains. Yet, scaling such systems for billions of users is complex and limited. We\u2019ve thrown everything and the kitchen sink at it with solutions like sharding and layer-2 blockchains to provide additional scaling methods.\n\nDespite this, most efforts still fall somewhat short in addressing all fundamental scalability issues. As a result of these failings, and perhaps in response to them, modular blockchains are strutting onto the scene as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Prime yourself and think, \u201cmore legos.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of modular blockchains\n\nThink of modular blockchains like the Swiss Army Knife of blockchain development.\n\nThese chains break down the blockchain into modular components, specializing in specific tasks at the core of a blockchain\u2019s architecture: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability. By distributing tasks across multiple specialized layers, modular blockchains can, in theory, achieve greater scalability, customizability and security at a faster pace. When you distribute the workload like that, magic happens \u2014 so why waddle about in intellectual exercises of scaling bloated layer-1s?\n\nAt the core of modular blockchain architecture lies a layered approach that\u2019s as elegant as it is efficient. The old heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the foundational layer of the crypto economy and hold down the fort with their robust security and stability. Meanwhile, layer-2 solutions like rollups and sidechains provide scalability without compromising the security of the base layer. Lastly, layer-3 protocols offer specialized environments tailored to specific development needs.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: Ethereum is too hard to use\n\nOne of the first projects to propose modular blockchain development is the Celestia network. Celestia currently functions by separating execution from consensus and implementing data availability sampling (DAS) as a core feature.\n\nModular blockchains\u2019 adroit-like qualities for specific engineering challenges translate into a targeted effectiveness to service specific industry niches.\n\nTo illustrate, GameSwift, a modular blockchain project, is currently working to facilitate the development of games hosted on-chain. Their goal is to create a network of applications that will help avoid gamers\u2019 in-game purchases or earned assets being stored in a central server and consequently hacked. To highlight the relevance of this innovation, global gaming audiences spent approximately $54 billion on additional in-game content in 2020.\n\nThe shape of things to come\n\nModular projects are already pushing boundaries and redefining what\u2019s possible in the blockchain space. Hybrid optimistic and zero-knowledge solutions are on the horizon, promising even greater scalability and security, as is the application of sharding, incentivized verification and parallelized VMs (virtual machines) on the execution layer of a chain.\n\nWith layer-1s feeling the heat, Ethereum devs released plans for a unified settlement and data availability layer: danksharding, a promising development, and a term I can\u2019t say aloud without curling my lips. But development and on-time delivery for these monolithic chains\u2019 upgrades have been historically slow and unmet.\n\nBy accepting monolithic chains as what might be holding us back, modular architectures offer a glimmer of hope. We are transitioning from monolithic blockchains and siloed consensus layers to modular, application-specific chains with shared consensus layers.\n\nWhile challenges remain in standardizing cross-chain communication and ensuring decentralization at each level, the potential benefits of modular blockchains are too compelling to ignore. These blockchains have the potential, and are already being applied, to impact industries like supply chain management, real estate (property transactions), digital identity verification, energy grid management and even healthcare data management.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a die-hard Bitcoin maximalist or an Ethereum enthusiast, one thing\u2019s for sure: In a modular future, users emerge as the ultimate beneficiaries.\n\nNiko Hosn, CTO of ZTX and founder of RareMint, is an expert in Web3 gaming and blockchain development.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Future Outlook - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The analysis of the price of Ethereum (ETH) is a recent and central topic in the world of cryptocurrencies, with experts actively discussing the future market dynamics.\n\nRecent developments have captured the attention of investors: the possibility that the price of Ethereum reaches 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs and the future implications of the approvals of spot Ether ETFs.\n\nEthereum: short-term price outlook and the analysis of the impact of the ETF\n\nArthur Cheong, founder of DeFiance Capital, has suggested that the price of Ethereum could reach 4,500 dollars before the approval of ETH ETFs. This prediction is based on a combination of technical and fundamental factors. In particular, Cheong highlights the growing adoption of Ethereum in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, which are driving the demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous improvement of Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure, such as the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d upgrade, promises to solve scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. These developments could further strengthen Ethereum\u2019s position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nL\u2019approvazione degli ETF spot Ether da parte della SEC statunitense rappresenta una svolta significativa per il mercato delle criptovalute. Secondo esperti come Bill Hughes di Consensys, questa mossa \u00e8 un\u2019ammissione implicita che Ethereum \u00e8 considerato un bene commodity.\n\nThe adoption of ETF on Ethereum could make the cryptocurrency more accessible to traditional investors, increasing liquidity and stabilizing prices.\n\nEric Balchunas, analista di Bloomberg, prevede che il lancio degli ETF su Ethereum seguir\u00e0 uno schema simile a quello degli ETF su Bitcoin, con una competizione intensa tra gli emittenti. Tuttavia, Balchunas nota che gli ETF su Ethereum potrebbero generare un volume inferiore rispetto a quelli su Bitcoin, stimando una raccolta totale di circa 1-2 miliardi di dollari nelle prime settimane.\n\nMatthew Sigel di VanEck, uno degli emittenti di ETF, highlights the importance of presenting Ethereum as an asset with intrinsic value, especially to tech and equity investors.\n\nSigel believes that many of these investors are not yet aware of the potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nGlobal competition and regulatory outlook\n\nYat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, observes that the approval of ETFs on Ethereum in the United States could stimulate other jurisdictions to follow suit.\n\nCountries like the Regno Unito, Singapore, Giappone, and Emirati Arabi Uniti might be incentivized to introduce their own crypto-based ETFs to avoid falling behind in the global competition.\n\nSiu emphasizes that this competition could lead to interesting developments and a change in sentiment in the United States towards greater acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTuttavia, la trasparenza delle normative rimane una preoccupazione, come evidenziato da Hughes, che critica la SEC per la mancanza di chiarezza sulle implicazioni delle sue decisioni.\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s price and its future prospects are influenced by a series of interconnected factors. The forecast of a short-term price increase up to 4,500 dollars reflects the optimism about the growing adoption and technological improvements of Ethereum.\n\nAt the same time, the approval of Ethereum ETFs could represent a breakthrough for traditional investors\u2019 accessibility to the cryptocurrency market, further stabilizing the price.\n\nThe global competition for the introduction of cryptocurrency ETFs and regulatory developments will continue to play a crucial role in determining the future of Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and market observers will need to closely monitor these developments to adapt their investment strategies in a rapidly changing environment."

        "title": "Why Is Ethereum Going Up? Unpacking The Sudden Surge - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Representation of Ethereum\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the cryptocurrency market lately, you\u2019re likely aware of the fact that Ethereum has made a 30 percent jump in recent days, marking a two-month high value, and shocking the overall crypto market. The price of Ethereum is $3,727.51 at the time of this writing, though that figure is obviously subject to change as the market continues to fluctuate. Given that ether has been all over the news in recent days, it\u2019s only fair to assume a number of fresh eyes have been placed on the world of crypto investments.\n\nSo, let\u2019s unpack what exactly Ethereum is, how it works, and examine the factors which led to this week\u2019s historic leap. Furthermore, we\u2019ll examine trends in the market and see if we can construct a comprehensive outline of where the decentralized currency will climb in the coming years. Without any further preamble, let\u2019s take a moment to dive into Ethereum, its price, and its applications.\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\nLike other hot cryptocurrencies on the market, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain, which utilizes open-source software to regulate price without the control of government forces. The blockchain was first programmed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, and has since grown to become one of the most commonly accepted cryptos on the market, second only to Bitcoin. Ethereum trades in a currency called ether, often abbreviated to ETH, and holds many investors all over the globe. Ether is designed to be programmable and secure, meaning it can be stored in an offline crypto wallet and used to purchase goods and services all over the world.\n\nAs one of the largest and most widely-recognized cryptocurrencies on the market, Ethereum is often utilized by those who are fresh into crypto trading, as well as seasoned veterans of the blockchain. Still, many traders were quite surprised to see that ETH had jumped so high this past week, as the fluctuating value seemingly came out of nowhere, at least to the untrained eye.\n\nWhat Caused Ethereum To Rise?\n\nMarket fluctuations are normal for any form of currency, but have the potential to be especially volatile for the crypto market. Still, a 30 percent jump on a seemingly random Tuesday, combined with ETH being on the market for over a decade, makes this fluctuation quite a surprise. Regardless, those who have had their finger on the pulse saw this Ethereum bump coming, due to a pair of key factors.\n\nFor starters, the SEC is currently on pace to make a decision regarding spot Ethereum\u2019s exchange-traded fund, (or ETF for short) which should make ether easier to trade than ever, and more accessible to the general market. If Ethereum\u2019s ETF does reach final approval from the SEC, prices will undoubtedly soar even higher. The second major factor is simple, as the public has reacted to the impending decision, causing droves of investors to vie for an opportunity to invest greater total funds into ETH.\n\nStory continues\n\nBasically, market trends were dictated to rise due to the recent upheaval the crypto coin is about to undergo, making investors more enthusiastic than ever to throw their money behind Ethereum funds. Bitcoin had a similar surge when it was approved by the SEC, so many crypto investors are currently hoping that their investment will see a similar meteoric rise.\n\nHow Much Will Ethereum Be Worth By The End Of 2024?\n\nDue to intense market changes, it can be quite difficult to predict the value of any cryptocurrency in advance. Still, some experts have maintained a watchful eye of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and managed to put together a comprehensive idea of where the market might take their value. According to Investing Haven, Ethereum was projected to level out somewhere between #2,222 and $3,597 before the recent ETF news. Bullish projections now see the coin reaching highs of $5,000 to $9,000 with any luck, though these figures are still wholly speculative.\n\nThe most important sign of Ethereum\u2019s success is actually, somewhat surprisingly, the US dollar, as that is the highest source of ETH investments at this time. Experts have advised those interested in making crypto investments to follow the trend of the US dollar, and invest based on successes in that market, as announced by the federal reserve.\n\nHow Much Will One Ether Be Worth In 2030?\n\nWhile short-term trends are nearly impossible to calculate, long-term trends suggest that Ethereum will continue to rise in the coming years, meaning it\u2019s still likely a prudent move to invest now, despite the exponential increase of the past week. Per a financial report in Forbes, a single share of Ether could reach highs of $40,000 by the end of 2030. While this figure may seem astronomic, it was calculated using several key factors, including the safety and scalability of Ethereum, the comprehensive market strategy put forth by blockchain developers, and the rise of additional decentralized platforms.\n\nWhile it can be quite scary to break into the world of crypto trading, Ethereum seems like it\u2019s currently on track to be one of the most accessible high-yield investments in recent memory. Still, be sure to invest carefully if you do decide to engage with the crypto market. Do lots of independent research, interface with known and trusted advisors, and as always, never get out over your skis."

Memecoins, considered to be the highest risk and highest reward part of the crypto industry, often witness notable price swings during a pro-crypto news cycle. By contrast, Ether has climbed a modest 2% since Thursday\u2019s approvals, trading at $3,847 on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe ETF approvals have \u201cpeople bullish on the far fringes of the coin space,\u201d Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University, told Fortune.\n\nIndeed, Google Trends data shows that search interest for \u201cEthereum\u201d over the past 12 months is near all-time highs, and memecoins are \u201cheavily driven\u201d by this kind of market attention, says Pat Doyle, a blockchain researcher at Amberdata.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that as money flows into the ecosystem through ETFs, it often trickles down to these smaller projects,\u201d Jonathan Bixby, chairman of Phoenix Digital Assets, told Fortune. Memecoins have surged recently because of their \u201csmall caps\u201d compared with those of other cryptocurrencies, he says.\n\nMemecoins occupy just a fraction of the market capitalization of major currencies: Floki boasts a market cap of just $2.9 billion, compared with Ethereum\u2019s $460 billion, according to CoinGecko data. In other words, Bixby suggests that investors of fringe coins could be anticipating a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats effect once the ETFs begin trading.\n\nHowever, Matt Ballensweig, managing director at BitGo, told Fortune that he doesn\u2019t attribute the recent growth for some memecoins to the ETF approvals or a single event, but it is \u201ca sign that momentum across other layer 1s (such as Solana) continues to remain strong.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSolana has basically solidified itself as the chain with the most \u2018speculative fun\u2019 as traders continue to gamble on memecoins on decentralized exchanges.\u201d\n\nOne reason why Ether has shown minimal price movements since Thursday is likely because, so far, the SEC has approved only the 19b-4 forms. These initial filings submitted by soon-to-be issuers allow the securities to be listed on exchanges. But for trading of the financial instruments to begin, the SEC must next approve the issuers\u2019 S-1 filings. These forms outline to potential investors and the SEC the structure of the asset, how it will be managed, and, in this case, how it plans to mirror the performance of the underlying asset\u2014Ether tokens.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t recall anytime there would be S-1s not approved after a 19b-4 approval. I don\u2019t think a precedent exists,\u201d Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, previously told Fortune. He estimated the forms would take about two weeks to be approved."

Prior to that, leading ETF industry analysts as well as major banking players of the likes of Standard Chartered claimed that these products were unlikely to be approved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the news about imminent ETF approval broke on social media, the Ether price entered a major uptrend, surging from $3,600 to $3,900 in a span of just three days.\n\nWeakening momentum\n\nDespite the major bullish catalyst, the leading altcoin has so far failed to gain a footing above the $4,000 level.

This bearish pattern occurs when an asset manages to make new highs, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) records slower highs. Based on this particular chart, it is clear that Ethereum is currently experiencing weakening momentum despite the substantial price increase. The RSI recorded a lower high in the 65-70 range after Ether surged to $3,900, which is the main horizontal resistance level.\n\nIf the bearish divergence ends up playing out, the price of the chief altcoin could experience a pullback from the current level. However, it is also likely that Ether will be able to break above $3,900 if the volume is strong enough."

The high-end forecast implies a 503% gain from current prices levels of around $3,890.\n\n\"Ethereum ETF approval is one of the most significant bullish events for Ethereum and the entire ecosystem,\" Lin wrote, adding: \"Even if ETH ETF does not gain as much traction as bitcoin in the initial weeks and months, it will still likely attract a staggeringly large amount of capital in the long run.\"\n\nA few reasons back her thesis, but generally, it's that ethereum is a tough contender against bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor one, ether offers an annual yield through staking, and is more than just a store of value asset. The ethereum blockchain is exposed to technologies such as DeFi and NFTs, offering it more functionality than bitcoin.\n\n\"Bitcoin could become the Dow Jones of crypto ETFs, while Ethereum becomes its NASDAQ,\" Lin said.\n\nUpside will also follow from a well-established correlation between bitcoin and ether pricing, which should actually tighten, Lin said. Not only is this because of the tech crypto's rising demand, but also due to a major supply shift that occurred in September 2022:\n\n\"The 20-month period before that date saw ETH supply increase from 114 million to 120 million, an increase of 5%. Today, 20 months since that date, ETH supply remains at the same 120 million,\" Lin said. \"Bitcoin, on the other hand, has seen its supply increase by 2.9% during the same period.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that case, ether could reach the $22,500 target if bitcoin manages to climb to $150,000 this year, an estimate frequently published by Standard Chartered. The asset is currently trading at over $68,000.\n\n\"Overall, I know the market is bullish on Ethereum right now, but it's not bullish enough. Now the spot ETH ETF is approved, all indicators indicate a massive ETH bull run in the coming months,\" Lin wrote.\n\nAlthough it could still take weeks before the new ETFs start trading, their approval sparked a slew of bullish excitement, though few see prices reach as high as Lin's forecast. For instance, Standard Chartered, expects ether to hit $8,000 by this year's end."

After facing delays and limited engagement, the top regulator in Wall Street gave the green light to a substantial number of asset managers seeking to offer Ethereum ETFs.\n\nIndustry observers like data firm Kaiko anticipate a further surge in value for the second-largest digital currency as a result of this development. While there may be some downward pressure on the price of ETH due to expected outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which has been trading at a discount for the past three months, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain positive.\n\nKaiko draws its conclusion from the impact of Bitcoin ETFs following their approval in January. Investors who had invested in Grayscale's GBTC product immediately sought to cash out, leading to a short-term decline in Bitcoin's price. Kaiko suggests that a similar trend could occur with Ethereum ETFs, causing selling pressure on ETH due to outflows from Grayscale's ETHE.\n\nHowever, despite potential short-term challenges, Kaiko emphasizes that the regulatory approval of Ethereum ETFs has important implications for ETH as an asset. It removes some of the regulatory uncertainty that has affected Ethereum's performance over the past year. JPMorgan, the largest bank in America, expects the funds to begin trading before November."

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nData from Coinglass shows that Ethereum has experienced a remarkable surge in May, rising nearly 30% with a few days remaining. This marks Ethereum\u2019s best monthly performance since February when it jumped 46%. This recovery is significant, especially considering the 17% drop it faced in April. A key factor in May\u2019s rebound is the approval of the Ethereum ETF 19-b filings, which has bolstered investor confidence.\n\nHistorical data from Coinglass indicates that May is typically Ethereum\u2019s strongest month, with an average gain of 31%. As we transition into June, it\u2019s noteworthy that Ethereum has only had two historically negative months: June and September. This makes the upcoming month particularly intriguing for Ethereum watchers.\n\nIn comparison, Bitcoin has also shown positive movement, increasing by over 12% in May, attempting to recover from a 15% drop in April. Historically, June has been a flat month for Bitcoin, averaging just a 0.25% increase, according to Coinglass data.\n\nDespite Ethereum trailing behind Bitcoin as an institutional asset, it shares similarities in the long-term holding behavior of its investors. With current trends and narratives favoring Ethereum, it may continue to outperform Bitcoin, as evidenced by the positive year-to-date ETH/BTC ratio. This suggests a shift in dominance towards Ethereum in the ongoing digital asset market dynamics."

For now, the price is getting ready for a swing toward or above $4,000, but its true strength is yet to be shown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has been seen in an uptrend that recently broke through $3,900. Currently, ETH is trading around $3,898, showing a gain of 1.92%, and the upsurge is supported well by swift trading volumes.\n\nThe technical indicators are aligning to suggest further upward movement. The 50-day EMA stands near $3,225, while the 100-day EMA lies close to $3,175. Both moving averages have provided strong support and confirmed the current trend. In addition, the RSI is at 72, which means that, at the moment, ETH is slightly overbought. Yet, this is not critical and, therefore, in case of a minor overheating, the asset can continue to grow a bit higher.\n\nTwo major price targets have emerged for Ethereum:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nthe immediate level now seems to be that psychological $4,000. Anything lower would imply the prevalent bearish sentiment confirmed at the moment. This will most probably see buyers join in and push the price even higher or, in other words, liquidate some substantial amount of short orders.\n\nAs for the liquidation heatmap: at the time, there was a huge cumulative long liquidation leverage all the way down to $3,200, meaning there were $3 billion worth of longs open \u2014 theoretically meaning there might be a massive sell-off in the case of liquidation. More than $1 billion in short orders get closed if the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market surges, causing a squeeze and sending bears away."

Recently, Bitcoin has faced potential price risks, Ethereum has generated buzz with ETF speculations, and Furrever Token is nearing the end of its successful $1.2 million presale. Here's an in-depth look at these key events and their potential impacts on the market.\n\nBitcoin Faces Price Drop Risks\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently experiencing potential price risks that have raised concerns among investors. A significant factor contributing to these fears is the activity of long-term holders. According to a recent analysis by analysts, these holders, who have amassed significant quantities of Bitcoin over time, are showing signs of profit-taking. This behavior often precedes a price drop, as large sell-offs can create downward pressure on Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe data suggests that long-term holders have been moving their BTC to exchanges, indicating a potential intent to sell. This trend, if it continues, could lead to increased volatility and a further decline in Bitcoin's price. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as regulatory developments and changes in investor sentiment, are also playing a role in the current market dynamics.\n\nDespite these concerns, Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals remain strong. Institutional adoption is growing, with major companies and financial institutions recognizing Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. The integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial systems and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class provides a solid foundation for its future growth.\n\nEthereum ETF Hopes Stir Optimism\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has generated significant buzz with the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This development could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. A recent report by a trusted source highlights that industry experts, including Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, believe that a spot Ethereum ETF could be beneficial for the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated and easily accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Ethereum. This could lead to increased demand and potentially drive up the price of ETH. Furthermore, an Ethereum ETF would signify a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial markets, paving the way for further innovation and adoption.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been cautious in its approach to approving cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. However, the growing interest from institutional investors and the increasing pressure from the crypto industry could eventually lead to a favorable decision.\n\nThe anticipation of an Ethereum ETF has already had a positive impact on market sentiment. Investors are hopeful that this development will bring more legitimacy to Ethereum and attract a new wave of capital into the market. As the industry awaits the SEC's decision, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF remains a key factor to watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurrever Token\u2019s $1.2 Million Presale Nears to an End\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum navigate their respective challenges and opportunities, Furrever Token (FURR) is making waves with its unique approach to the crypto market. Furrever Token aims to create a heartwarming ecosystem centered around adorable cat imagery, offering a refreshing contrast to the often serious and technical world of blockchain projects.\n\nThe Furrever Token presale has been a resounding success, raising over $1.2 million as it nears its end.

Community engagement is a cornerstone of the Furrever ecosystem, with regular challenges and events that encourage users to share their love for cuteness.

The team, while not doxxed, has shown commitment to the project's longevity by locking their tokens for a year. The organic growth of the Furrever Token community, with nearly 4,000 active members on Telegram, further underscores its legitimacy and potential.\n\nAs the presale nears its end, now is the ideal time to invest in Furrever Token.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Taking a Breather Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "These three megacap tokens are seeing significant selling pressure to kick off the short week.\n\nAs we kick off a short week, investors in a range of speculative assets are seeing selling pressure build. Of course, there are plenty of macro reasons for this trepidation. Some rather important inflation readings are due later this week, which could impact everything from growth stocks to commodities to cryptocurrencies. Everything is tied to interest rates these days.\n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin (BTC -0.95%), Ethereum (ETH 0.32%), and Dogecoin (DOGE -3.81%) are among the megacap tokens seeing declines today. Over the past 24 hours, these three top tokens have slumped 3.8%, 3.5%, and 4%, respectively, as of 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nLet's dive into what's driving today's price action in these top tokens.\n\nEnthusiasm over key catalysts wears off\n\nInvestors in these three megacap tokens have certainly had quite the run over the past few weeks, and really since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin started the party off with the approval of a dozen spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, which conjured up some significant demand for its token. In combination with a halving event, which saw the amount of newly minted Bitcoin slashed in half, this created a supply-and-demand dynamic investors liked.\n\nEthereum recently saw similar catalysts take hold, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum ETFs last week as well. Additionally, previous upgrades have resulted in Ethereum becoming less inflationary, and depending on the day, deflationary based on token burn metrics relative to transaction volumes.\n\nAs a more speculative asset, Dogecoin has ridden market momentum higher. But with these catalysts now seemingly in the rearview mirror (it's really amazing how quickly the market adjusts to news, particularly in this space), some investors may be looking to sell into this news and wait patiently for another catalyst to take hold. A similar \"sell the news\" effect took place immediately following the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year.\n\nUntil the next catalyst takes hold, investors appear to be on pause for the next reason to bet big on this sector (and these three tokens by default).\n\nA pause in the rally, or a reversal?\n\nNow, the question is whether this recent dip is a sign of more downside to come, or if it's simply a consolidation period before the next move higher. Earlier this month, a speculative wave hit the crypto sector, driving everything from meme tokens like Dogecoin to large-cap cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum higher. But since then, it appears the broader crypto market is awaiting the next catalyst on the horizon.\n\nThere is certainly a tremendous amount of innovation and technological movement happening underneath the surface in the crypto realm. I wouldn't be surprised to see headlines pop up for any of these three tokens that have the ability to move the market higher, with all three benefiting from positive news. I just don't know what the catalyst will be, or when positive momentum can be expected to build again. For now, I'm happily watching this price action from the sidelines."

Discover SCENE\n\nMost of the top 100 tokens are in the green as Bitcoin jumps 2.5% and slips past $70,000 while Ethereum flirts with $4,000. The price of BTC is $70,136 while the price of ETH is $3,934 as of writing, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis comes as Argentina opens discussions with El Salvador\u2019s Digital Assets Commission on their experience using Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador has established itself as a global leader not only in the use of Bitcoin but also in the broader realm of digital assets,\u201d Roberto E. Silva, president of Argentina\u2019s National Securities Commission, said in a blog post. \u201cWe aim to strengthen our ties with El Salvador and are exploring potential collaboration agreements.\u201d\n\nEl Slavador made headlines in 2021 when it became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender, leading to a surge in tourism and going on Bitcoin spending sprees. Now Argentina, with their new eccentric leader Javier Milei, is looking to explore Bitcoin as legal tender too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to WorldoMeters, Argentina is the 22nd largest country by GDP with a population of over 45 million people.

Meanwhile, $17 million of short Ethereum positions have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass.\n\nThis is because Ethereum has seen similar gains of 3.8%, putting it within touching distance of the $4,000 mark. On Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a landmark approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, effectively green-lighting Ethereum trading on Wall Street.\n\nOver the coming hours and days the price remained largely unchanged, even dropping 4% at one point.

        "content": "Recent events in the cryptocurrency world highlight Nvidia Corp\u2018s NVDA influence on AI-related tokens. Nvidia, a leader in AI technology, reported higher-than-expected earnings for Q1, causing a stir in the digital assets market. Tokens like Render RNDR/USD, closely tied to Nvidia, saw notable market movements.\n\nRender's value surged before Nvidia's earnings announcement but dipped briefly due to profit-taking. This demonstrates how AI-related cryptocurrencies react to major tech developments.\n\nThe Role of Ethereum and Tokenized Assets\n\nEthereum ETH/USD is central to the digital asset space, especially with the anticipated approval of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF. Ondo Finance, a project backed by Coinbase, has gained attention by backing its OUSG token with BlackRock's BUIDL tokenized fund. This move represents the growing integration of traditional financial assets with blockchain technology, pointing to a future where tokenized assets play a role in investment portfolios.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Whale Activity\n\nWhale activity in the AI token world has been notable. Santiment reported that a known whale moved nearly 4.9 million RNDR tokens, indicating heightened market interest and volatility. This movement and rising long positions among traders suggest a strong belief in the potential of AI-related cryptocurrencies. It highlights the interplay between advancements in AI and the growing crypto market.\n\nBlockchain\u2019s Transformative Role\n\nBlockchain technology revolutionizes financial transactions by enhancing security and speeding up processes. The Benzinga event will feature discussions on the latest advancements in blockchain, including staking, mining, and custody technologies. Understanding these developments is crucial as digital assets become more integrated into mainstream financial systems.\n\nThe intersection of AI and digital assets is reshaping the future of financial transactions. Nvidia's recent earnings and the subsequent market response of tokens like Render highlight the increasing relevance of AI in the crypto space. Ethereum's expanding role, illustrated by projects like Ondo Finance, points to a broader acceptance of tokenized assets within traditional finance.\n\nFuture of Digital Assets\n\nThese market dynamics set the stage for Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event in New York City on Nov. 19. Attendees can expect in-depth discussions on the integration of AI and blockchain and their broader implications for the financial industry.\n\nImage: Shutterstock"

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has created a significant buzz in the crypto market. However, what many might have expected didn\u2019t happen, Ether\u2019s price has barely moved following this groundbreaking news\u2014unlike when the likelihood of its approval pushed Ethereum\u2019s price to a two month high.\n\nMarket Reaction Post-Approval\n\nOn May 23, the SEC approved eight spot Ether ETFs to be listed on their respective exchanges. Prior to the announcement, Ether (ETH) experienced a 3.4% drop but recovered by around 5% shortly after, trading at $3,806 at the time of writing. Despite the approval, Ether\u2019s price did not exhibit a significant upward trend, reflecting a complex market reaction.\n\nCrypto commentator Zach Rynes argues that the lack of significant movement post-approval reflects the notion that \u201ceveryone who wanted to buy the approval already did.\u201d Ether had already surged 29% over the past week following reports that the SEC might approve the ETFs, indicating that the approval news was already priced in by the market.\n\nThe SEC approved a rule change that would pave the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether, one of the world's largest cryptocurrencies. The decision comes less than six months after the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs. https://t.co/5KntbFp5Jv pic.twitter.com/1wQD2tv1IO \u2014 CNBC (@CNBC) May 23, 2024\n\nAlthough the ETFs have been approved, they have not yet been cleared to launch. An approved S-1 filing, which includes comprehensive details on the firm\u2019s financials and risk profile, is still required. VanEck has recently submitted its amended S-1 filing to the SEC, and analysts suggest it could take weeks to months for these filings to be approved. This delay means that the actual influx of new capital is still pending.\n\nFuture Expectations\n\nThe options market continues to show significant open interest in ETH options, particularly for expiry dates in late May. With open interest of $867 million for May 24 and $3.22 billion for May 31 on Deribit, the market remains bullish. If Ether\u2019s price stays above $3,600, many put options will become worthless, favoring call options and potentially driving further bullish sentiment.\n\nCrypto research firm Second Mountain anticipates a \u201cmassive capital inflow in the first week\u201d following the ETFs\u2019 launch, potentially reaching billions. However, the immediate impact might not result in a sharp upward trend, as seen with Bitcoin\u2019s price after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved earlier this year.\n\nThere are also concerns regarding Grayscale\u2019s announcement of its plans to convert its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ether ETF, which could lead to significant outflows. This mirrors the situation with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw substantial asset outflows.\n\nHistory could repeat itself when Grayscale launches its spot Ether ETF \u2014 meaning millions in $ETH outflows daily, according to @KaikoData. pic.twitter.com/Ojwa6VMHCY \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 28, 2024\n\nThe approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States marks a significant milestone for Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. This development is expected to boost Ether\u2019s price, potentially driving it to $10,000 by the end of 2024, as suggested by Andrey Stoychev of Nexo. The SEC\u2019s approval of these ETFs is seen as a positive shift, possibly influenced by political pressures and the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nDespite the initial market reaction being muted, with Ether\u2019s price experiencing only modest fluctuations, the full impact of these ETFs will likely be realized once the required S-1 filings are approved and the ETFs are launched. Analysts predict that this could take weeks to months, but once operational, these ETFs are anticipated to attract substantial institutional investment and increase market liquidity.\n\nAs the market adjusts to this new development, investor confidence is expected to grow, leading to sustained positive momentum for Ether. The approval is a promising step towards greater adoption and integration of Ethereum into the financial mainstream, setting the stage for significant future growth.\n\nAuthor: Makinde Adeniyi\n\nThe editorial team at #DisruptionBanking has taken all precautions to ensure that no persons or organisations have been adversely affected or offered any sort of financial advice in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to pull crowds with stunning rallies this year. With the approval of their respective spot ETFs, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrencies are expected to attract billions.\n\nAs such, popular analyst Lark Davis has made bold predictions for the top assets.\n\nBold Predictions For Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nIn a recent tweet, Davis predicted that Bitcoin will soar to $150,000 and Ethereum will reach $15,000, driven by market dynamics. He points to the inflows already seen in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are attracting hundreds of millions of dollars daily.\n\nEthereum ETFs are on the cusp of starting trading, expected to further fuel market enthusiasm. Davis said he anticipates a bullish scenario where a peak bull market coincides with massive investments from countries, wealth managers, pension funds, and retail investors, resulting in billions of dollars being funneled into ETFs daily.\n\nThis confluence of factors, according to Davis, means current bullish sentiments are likely underestimating the potential growth.\n\n\u201cImagine the scenes when retail is here, and the bull market is at its peak. When countries, wealth managers, pension funds, and retail will be buying billions of dollars worth of ETFs daily. You are seriously not bullish enough.\u201d\n\nBTC ETFs Hoard 1M BTC; ETH Prepares for Upswing\n\nAs of May 24th, the total amount of Bitcoin held by all spot ETFs stands at around 1,002,343 BTC, with a notable proportion allocated to US-based products out of the 32 ETFs currently available. This signals growing mainstream acceptance and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly in the US.\n\nMoreover, the fact that spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over a million BTC implies increased demand for the asset. As these ETFs acquire and hold Bitcoin, it reduces the available supply in circulation.\n\nWith the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply fixed and diminishing due to factors such as halving events, increased institutional interest and investment through ETFs could intensify scarcity, potentially driving up demand and prices further.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s price failed to challenge the $4,000 resistance, but promising signs are emerging that could cause a much-needed spike, as per the latest price analysis."

        "title": "Comparing smart contracts across different blockchains from Ethereum to Solana - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The crypto industry has several unique approaches to smart contract execution and decentralized applications (DApps). These innovations are driven by the need for scalability, security, and efficiency, allowing developers to build increasingly sophisticated applications. Yet, what is so different between the smart contracts on different blockchains? Which is the smartest smart contract platform?\n\nTuring completeness is a key aspect of smart contracts. Turing completeness is a concept from computational theory that refers to a system\u2019s ability to perform any computation given enough time and resources. It is named after the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing, who developed the concept in the context of the theoretical Turing machine.\n\nAmong the leading blockchain platforms, Ethereum, Internet Computer (ICP), Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana stand out for their distinct strategies in leveraging Turing completeness and smart contracts. This article explores how each platform addresses the challenges and opportunities in the blockchain space, highlighting their specific capabilities and contributions to the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Smart Contracts\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stands as a cornerstone of the Ethereum network, a decentralized platform enabling the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). The EVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed specifically for Ethereum, facilitating the computation of state changes after each new block addition. Its Turing completeness allows for executing any computation given sufficient resources, making Ethereum capable of supporting complex smart contracts and DApps. This capability, however, necessitates a gas mechanism to measure and manage the computational effort required for each operation. Gas prevents infinite loops and ensures network stability by requiring users to specify a gas limit for their transactions, halting any that exceed this limit.\n\nSmart contract development on Ethereum primarily uses Solidity, a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level programming language influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. Solidity supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, enabling developers to write smart contracts that implement intricate business logic and generate a chain of transaction records on the blockchain. Compiled into EVM bytecode, Solidity code is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, where the EVM executes it to perform the specified operations.\n\nSecurity is paramount in Ethereum smart contracts, given their immutable nature and the significant value they often control. Common vulnerabilities include reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and improper use of delegatecall. High-profile incidents like the DAO hack and Parity wallet issues highlight the importance of secure coding practices.\n\nDespite its theoretical Turing completeness, the EVM faces practical limitations due to the gas mechanism. Gas limits curtail infinite loops and excessively complex computations, ensuring the network remains functional and efficient. This practical constraint is crucial for maintaining network stability, though it limits the complexity of operations that can be executed.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Turing completeness has enabled a wide range of applications, including fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens, DeFi platforms, decentralized exchanges, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These capabilities have fostered a thriving ecosystem of DApps and services. Additionally, EVM compatibility allows developers to port their DApps and tokens to other EVM-compatible chains like Polygon and Avalanche, enhancing interoperability and expanding the ecosystem.\n\nEthereum\u2019s pioneering role in blockchain technology drives innovation and adoption in the decentralized application space. Its Turing completeness, coupled with the flexibility and security measures of the EVM, positions Ethereum as a leading platform for developing and deploying smart contracts and DApps.\n\nThe Internet Computer Protocol Smart Contracts & Canisters\n\nThe Internet Computer (ICP), developed by the DFINITY Foundation, introduces a novel approach to decentralized applications (DApps) and services through its unique architecture. At the core of ICP are canister smart contracts, which combine code and state, allowing for sophisticated computation and data storage. These canisters are Turing complete, enabling the execution of any computation given sufficient resources. This capability supports the development of complex DApps entirely on-chain, offering a scalable and efficient platform.\n\nOne of ICP\u2019s standout features is its reverse gas model. Unlike traditional blockchains, where users pay transaction fees, ICP developers pre-pay for computational resources by converting ICP tokens into cycles. These cycles, which are stable and pegged to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), cover the costs of computation, storage, and bandwidth. This model eliminates the need for end users to hold tokens or pay gas fees, simplifying the user experience and enabling developers to implement their own tokenomics and monetization strategies.\n\nICP\u2019s interoperability extends to other blockchains, notably through its direct interaction with the Bitcoin network. Features like Threshold ECDSA and the Bitcoin adapter enable canisters to securely hold, receive, and send BTC. Furthermore, ICP has introduced an API that allows its smart contracts to communicate with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain, facilitating cross-chain liquidity and integration with other blockchain ecosystems.\n\nSecurity and scalability are paramount for ICP. Chain-key cryptography ensures the security and integrity of smart contracts through secure key management and digital signatures. ICP\u2019s architecture supports horizontal scaling by adding new subnets, allowing for the deployment of an unlimited number of canisters and storing vast amounts of data. This scalability is essential for large-scale applications, ensuring the platform can grow to meet increasing demands.\n\nPractical considerations for developers include managing the cycle balance of their canisters to ensure continuous operation. Tools like CycleOps automate this process, making it easier to maintain and top up canisters as needed. The stable cost of cycles also makes ICP an attractive platform for building cost-effective and scalable DApps, providing predictable and manageable expenses for developers.\n\nICP supports various applications, from simple, smart contracts to complex multi-canister projects. Decentralized social media platforms like DSCVR, decentralized email services like Dmail, and various DeFi applications exemplify the diversity of use cases on ICP. The platform\u2019s aim to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services emphasizes its potential to revolutionize how applications are built and operated, offering security, scalability, and user-friendly experiences.\n\nThe Internet Computer\u2019s approach to smart contracts, leveraging Turing completeness, a reverse gas model, and robust interoperability features, positions it as a powerful platform for the next generation of decentralized applications and services. Its emphasis on security, scalability, and cost efficiency further enhances its appeal, making it a significant player in the evolving blockchain landscape.\n\nPolkadot Smart Contracts on Parachains\n\nPolkadot is designed to enable interoperability among various blockchains through its unique architecture. The network\u2019s core comprises the relay chain and parachains, each playing a distinct role in maintaining the system\u2019s functionality and scalability. The relay chain serves as the central hub, providing shared security, consensus, and interoperability, while the parachains are independent blockchains tailored for specific use cases, supporting a diverse range of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nAs a layer 0 protocol, the relay chain does not natively support smart contracts but facilitates the coordination and security of connected parachains. These parachains can communicate with each other and external blockchains via bridges, enabling seamless asset and data transfers across different networks. This interoperability is a key feature of Polkadot, fostering a cohesive ecosystem where various blockchains can operate together.\n\nPolkadot supports smart contracts through several environments, notably ink! and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Ink! is a Rust-based language explicitly designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing developers to write efficient and secure WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts. Polkadot also supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts via the EVM pallet, enabling developers to port their existing Ethereum DApps to Polkadot with minimal modifications.\n\nParachains like Moonbeam and Astar Network exemplify Polkadot\u2019s versatile smart contract capabilities. Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible parachain that supports Solidity smart contracts, allowing developers to utilize familiar Ethereum tools and libraries. Astar Network supports EVM and Wasm smart contracts, offering true interoperability with cross-consensus messaging (XCM) and cross-virtual machine (XVM) capabilities. Phala Network, another notable parachain, provides Turing-complete smart contracts with enhanced privacy and security through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Phat Contracts for off-chain computation.\n\nThe Substrate framework underpins Polkadot\u2019s development, providing a modular toolkit for building blockchains and parachains. Substrate supports multiple programming languages, including Rust, Go, and C++, offering developers flexibility. Polkadot\u2019s testnets, such as Kusama and Rococo, provide real-world environments for testing and optimizing smart contracts before deployment on the mainnet.\n\nSecurity in Polkadot is bolstered by its shared security model, where the relay chain ensures the collective security of all connected parachains. This shared security mechanism is critical for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the network. Comprehensive security audits, both manual and automated, are integral to Polkadot\u2019s approach, with tools and services from firms like ImmuneBytes and Hacken helping to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s use cases span various sectors, with DeFi being a prominent area. Projects like Acala Network offer DeFi products, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), staking, and stablecoins, leveraging EVM and Substrate-based smart contracts. Phala Network\u2019s privacy-preserving smart contracts enable secure DeFi applications, such as confidential trading and data management.\n\nCross-chain interoperability is a hallmark of Polkadot, supported by various bridge solutions that connect with external blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. These bridges facilitate cross-chain asset transfers, expanding the reach and utility of the Polkadot ecosystem. Additionally, Polkadot supports gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) applications through parachains like Astar Network, providing a versatile platform for innovative gaming experiences and digital asset management.\n\nPolkadot\u2019s architecture, combining the relay chain and parachains, creates a robust and scalable environment for developing Turing-complete smart contracts. Its support for multiple smart contract languages and environments and a strong emphasis on interoperability and security position Polkadot as a leading platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nCardano Smart Contracts\n\nCardano, a blockchain platform known for its research-driven approach, offers a unique environment for developing smart contracts. Unlike Ethereum, which relies on a single Turing-complete language, Cardano employs a dual-language approach to balance flexibility and security. This includes Plutus, a Turing-complete language, and Marlowe, a non-Turing-complete domain-specific language (DSL) tailored for financial contracts.\n\nBased on Haskell, Plutus allows developers to write complex and expressive smart contracts. Its features include higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, and immutable data structures, hallmarks of functional programming. Plutus contracts consist of on-chain code that runs on the Cardano blockchain and off-chain code that operates on the user\u2019s machine, helping to manage computational resources efficiently. Using Haskell\u2019s strong type system and formal verification capabilities ensures the correctness and security of smart contracts, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.\n\nMarlowe, in contrast, is designed specifically for financial agreements and is non-Turing-complete. This design choice guarantees termination, meaning contracts will always complete their execution, avoiding issues like infinite loops. Marlowe\u2019s simplicity and safety make it accessible to users without programming experience. It supports visual programming and traditional coding through the Marlowe Playground, a sandbox environment for developing, simulating, and testing contracts.\n\nSecurity is a critical focus for Cardano, with formal verification and thorough code audits emphasized to identify and fix vulnerabilities before deployment. The Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) model used by Cardano ensures that transactions are deterministic and predictable, enhancing security by simplifying transaction validation and reducing the risk of unexpected outcomes. Additionally, Cardano treats tokens as native assets, simplifying token transactions and minimizing the risk of smart contract exploits.\n\nDeveloping smart contracts on Cardano requires familiarity with Haskell for Plutus and an understanding of Marlowe for financial contracts. Educational resources like the IOG Academy provide learning paths for developers and financial professionals. Tools like the Marlowe Playground and the Plutus development environment aid in simulating and testing contracts before deployment, ensuring they function as intended.\n\nCardano\u2019s approach to scalability includes Hydra and Mithril, solutions designed to enhance throughput and reduce overhead. These technologies make the platform suitable for large-scale applications. Cardano\u2019s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, is energy-efficient and scalable, addressing the limitations of older blockchain networks.\n\nBy combining Turing-complete and non-Turing-complete languages, Cardano aims to offer a robust and secure environment for developing decentralized applications. Its emphasis on formal verification, security, and scalability positions it as a strong competitor in blockchain, capable of supporting a wide range of innovative and secure applications.\n\nSolana Smart Contracts\n\nSolana is engineered to support decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts with a focus on speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) plays a central role in achieving these goals by providing the execution environment for Solana\u2019s smart contracts. Designed to handle high transaction throughput and low latency, the SVM ensures efficient processing, leveraging Turing completeness to enable any computation given sufficient resources.\n\nThe SVM\u2019s Turing completeness allows developers to create complex and versatile smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. Solana\u2019s unique architecture, including the Sealevel parallel execution engine, significantly enhances the network\u2019s throughput and efficiency by processing multiple transactions simultaneously. This parallel execution capability is crucial for maintaining the high performance that distinguishes Solana from other blockchain platforms.\n\nSmart contract development on Solana primarily uses Rust and C, chosen for their performance and safety features, which are critical for developing secure and efficient contracts. The Anchor framework further simplifies this process by providing tools and libraries that streamline development and ensure best practices. To set up the development environment, developers install the Solana Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Rust, essential for deploying and managing smart contracts on the network.\n\nSolana\u2019s Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism is a key innovation that timestamps transactions to create a verifiable order of events. This reduces the time required to reach consensus and enhances network speed and efficiency. Combined with other architectural innovations, PoH allows Solana to process over 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchain platforms.\n\nUnlike traditional EVM-based blockchains, Solana\u2019s smart contracts are stateless, meaning the contract logic is separated from the state, which is stored in external accounts. This separation enhances security and scalability by isolating the contract code from the data it interacts with. Solana\u2019s account model allows for program reusability, enabling developers to create new tokens or applications by interacting with existing programs, reducing the need to redeploy smart contracts, and lowering costs.\n\nSecurity remains a priority in Solana\u2019s ecosystem. Common vulnerabilities include account management errors, arithmetic errors, and potential reentrancy attacks. Comprehensive security audits, combining manual code reviews and automated testing tools, are employed to identify and mitigate these risks. The Solana community actively audits and secures smart contracts, fostering a collaborative environment focused on enhancing security.\n\nGaming applications on Solana benefit from its speed and scalability, allowing for fast and reliable transaction processing essential for immersive and interactive experiences. Additionally, Solana supports various Web3 projects, enabling decentralized social networks, content platforms, and other applications that leverage blockchain technology for enhanced security and user control.\n\nSolana\u2019s unique approach to smart contracts, leveraging Turing completeness, stateless architecture, and innovative consensus mechanisms, positions it as a leading platform for decentralized applications. Its focus on speed, scalability, and low costs makes it an attractive choice for developers and users, driving its adoption and fostering a dynamic ecosystem.\n\nSmart Contract Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, the diversity in approaches to Turing completeness and smart contract execution across platforms like Ethereum, ICP, Polkadot, Cardano, and Solana showcases the innovation within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nEach platform offers unique strengths\u2014whether it\u2019s Ethereum\u2019s extensive DApp ecosystem, ICP\u2019s user-friendly model, Polkadot\u2019s interoperability, Cardano\u2019s focus on security, or Solana\u2019s unmatched speed and scalability.

At the time of writing, ETH is worth $3,845, in a pump of +15% compared to a month ago.\n\nNot only that, with this approval, the SEC of the USA would have also confirmed that Ethereum is not a security and that, therefore, it is legitimized to soar in the bull market.\n\n\u201c`html\n\nPersino il CEO di Binance, Richard Teng, si \u00e8 voluto sbilanciare commentando tale evento come una milestone for the entire crypto sector che sta ottenendo sempre pi\u00f9 una growing acceptance within traditional frameworks.\n\nEthereum: what is the Pectra update?\n\n\u201c`\n\nThe new Pectra update will be implemented between the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025, introducing exclusive features within EVM wallets.\n\nNello specifico, l\u2019aggiornamento include l\u2019Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF), che presenta 11 proposte di miglioramento volte a potenziare il codice EVM.\n\nAmong the various novelties, Pectra will introduce the ability to delegate functions to smart contracts directly from the crypto wallet, approve transactions in batch, and pay for gas with different ERC20 tokens.\n\nNot only, Pectra will integrate the EIP-7251, the proposal that aims to increase the staking limit for validators by 64 times, going from the canonical 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe new proposal by Vitalik Buterin, the EIP-7702, will then introduce a new type of transaction that will allow Ethereum account addresses to temporarily function as smart contract wallets during a transaction, then restoring their original state.\n\nETH price predictions for 2025\n\nAnalysts at work: it is time to consider in the various price forecasts for Ethereum for 2025, also the introduction of the Petra update.\n\nAt the moment, the three hypotheses for the current bull run of Ethereum, and therefore short-term forecasts for ETH are:\n\nETH supera i 4.000$;\n\nETH above $4,100, shifting the target to $5,000 ;\n\n; ETH could reach $6,600.\n\nIn the long term, however, some predictions see the price of ETH reaching $5,000 by the end of 2024, while in 2025, ETH should reach the maximum level of $6,500. It should be specified, however, that such predictions do not mention the new Pectra update."

Michael Saylor also commented on the recent spot ETH ETF approval by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso read: Ethereum price yet to react to ETF approval, experts share reason for SEC's change of mind\n\nDaily digest market movers: Bullish sentiment, Michael Saylor, Pectra upgrade\n\nFollowing ETH's price gain on Monday, trading firm QCP Capital noted that market participants are becoming more bullish on the largest altcoin, considering potential institutional demand when spot ETH ETFs go live.\n\nETH has gained about 27% since last week after it became apparent that the SEC would approve issuers' 19b-4 filings submitted by exchanges. While the regulator has yet to approve S-1 applications, several analysts have expressed that these approvals are a matter of when and not if; hence, most investors are extremely bullish. This is visible in the ETH Fear and Greed Index, which hit 76 on Wednesday, signifying increased investor confidence.\n\nHowever, QCP Capital noted, \"While we are structurally positive ETH, we don't see a major breakout until we have more clarity on the S-1 approvals and get some inflow data, which should only be a matter of time.\"\n\nRead more: SEC approves spot Ethereum ETFs after shocking U-turn\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale CEO Michael Saylor, who earlier predicted that the SEC would deny spot ETH ETF applications, has said, \"You have to rethink all your models\" after the approval. He said that a spot Ethereum ETF is good for Bitcoin as it, together with other crypto assets, \"serves as another line of defense for Bitcoin.\"\n\nAlso, Ethereum developers have projected Q1 2025 to potentially launch the Pectra upgrade after the Dencun upgrade in March. Pectra will feature several updates, including:\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal EIP-7251, which will increase the limit of maximum number of staked ETH per validator from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH.\n\nEIP-7702 replacing EIP-3074 to enable account abstraction where Ethereum addresses can temporarily function as smart contracts during a transaction.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF), aimed at improving the EVM code framework for the Main Chain and Layer 2 functionalities.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum attempts to break past key level\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,924 on Monday after gaining nearly 3%. ETH bulls are showing strength with only $7.76 million in long liquidations compared to $15.59 million in short liquidations.\n\nWhile ETH has rejected the $4,000 key level twice since the ETF approval, it may break past this level when the market fully resumes on Tuesday. If ETH successfully overcomes $4,000, it would aim for the $4,093 resistance \u2014 its highest level since December 2021. The $3,605 level may serve as a good support level in case the bullish momentum cools.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nHowever, many expect ETH to see more significant gains in the coming weeks as it's barely performed in this cycle compared to previous cycles. Additionally, spot ETH ETF inflows after potential issuers' S-1 approvals would help boost ETH price to a new all-time high above $4,878."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith U.S. financial markets on hold for Memorial Day, the long holiday weekend has meant a relatively quiet start to the week for most crypto markets\u2014but one digital asset is booming: Chainlink (LINK).\n\nThe 14th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, LINK is Monday's best performer out of the top 40 coins. CoinGecko data shows that it has risen more than 10% in the past day, and is now trading for $18.75.\n\nLINK is the native token of Chainlink, an oracle project built on Ethereum that's designed to get information in and out of a blockchain\u2014and between chains\u2014securely.\n\nThe surge is likely the result of LINK holders and supporters feeling bullish on the news dropping that Chainlink would be co-presenting with international payments platform Swift at this week's Consensys conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n15,000+ people from 100+ countries are attending @consensus2024. We are excited to be on the ground with multiple events and experiences, including a @SergeyNazarov keynote and a fireside chat with Swift.

That pilot, dubbed Smart NAV, allowed Wall Street institutions to make mutual fund data available on public networks.\n\nFinally, crypto investment firm 21Shares today featured Chainlink in its latest weekly research newsletter, saying it is \u201crevolutionizing the realm of tokenization\u201d and crediting it with enabling \u201cover $10 trillion in transactions to more than 2000 projects over 22 separate networks.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration between DTCC and @Chainlink is revolutionizing the realm of tokenization!

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum is clearly amping up for a potential surge toward a new yearly high as the price of the second-biggest cryptocurrency approaches $4,000. Previously, some analysts stated that ETH is going to reach $4,500 before ETF trading goes live.\n\nEthereum has also continued to rise above the $3,800 level, now trading at around $3,906. This bullish run is rather supported by a considerably high amount of volume, indicating good buying interest. Currently, the level has found strong support from the 50-Day EMA, lying around $3,225, and from the 100-Day EMA around $3,170, supporting ETH.\n\nAt the moment, the Ethereum RSI is at 72, indicating that ETH is overbought. Maybe it signals a pullback, but the general sentiment of the market remains in place. Recent price action noted a clear breakout from consolidation, with more targets on higher resistance levels for ETH.\n\nBut it has to hold momentum to continue the journey toward $4,500 and penetrate above the psychological $4,000 price level. If at all broken, the next crucial resistance we are looking at in the range of $4,200 could give power to the doors for ETH toward $4,500. The current levels to watch are $3,800 and $3,500 on the downside, which should hold to maintain the bullish bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin's path to $70,000\n\nBitcoin has failed to hold itself above or even close to the crucial price level of $70,000 and is currently consolidating around $69,000. Unfortunately, this is a signal of decreasing power and might hint at some bearishness ahead.\n\nThis implies that the digital asset is failing to sustain levels above $70,000, a level that signals the continuation of massive buying pressure. From looking at recent price action, Bitcoin has once again failed to sustain above the $70,000 level, where most significant resistance lies.\n\nThe consolidation can be visibly seen on the daily chart, where Bitcoin is exchanging levels just under $69,000. Besides that, the struggle to maintain gains above the psychological level continues to pick up momentum while consolidating at that level, with the 50-day moving average.\n\nFailure to breach the resistance at $70,000, along with consolidating price action, may also signal potential bearish trends. If Bitcoin loses the battle to hold above levels beyond the immediate support at $68,000, it might test the lower support levels around $65,000 and $62,000, as depicted by the moving averages. The selling pressure surge under these moving averages is likely to push for larger losses toward the $60,000 level.\n\nSolana hits support\n\nSolana is approaching a strong support level in the form of the 26 EMA. It is not the first time the price of SOL is going to test this resistance level as, in the past, SOL has hit it around $160 and successfully emerged upwards.\n\nSolana is testing such a strong support level in the form of the 26 EMA. It would not be the first time the price of SOL has touched this resistance level. This has been the case in the past, whereby SOL touched around $160 in price and sprang upward successfully. Solana is currently trading around $164, which is close to a major support zone expanded by the 26-day EMA.\n\nThis has acted strongly in the past, notably around the $160 zone, from which SOL managed to find strength and rise. One of the very important technical indicators monitored very closely by traders, therefore, is the 26 EMA, as it usually provides a cushion during a bullish run and resistance when in a downtrend.\n\nSolana has been quite volatile pricewise but has remained upwards over the last few trading weeks. Further, the price has retracted at the levels around $190, testing the 26 EMA support. Not far away, the 50-day EMA is located at $153, and in the case of a failure of the 26 EMA, that is the next line of defense."

        "title": "Analyst Says Ethereum Flippening Bitcoin Is Only A Matter Of Time: Here's Why - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In 2017-2018, the debate was whether Tron would surpass Ethereum to second place. But, looking at how things have evolved, the debate has been settled.\n\nEthereum is the most dominant smart contracts platform. However, this has not prevented analysts from comparing Bitcoin and the world\u2019s most valuable altcoin.\n\nWill ETH Finally Flip BTC?\n\nTaking to X, one user claims that Ethereum only needs time to flip Bitcoin as the crypto leader. Citing multiple factors, the analyst said Ethereum is better placed to take over from the first cryptocurrency, pointing to, among others, the larger user base and the benefits smart contracts bring to the equation.\n\nLooking at CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.3 trillion, with each coin trading for over $68,000 at spot rates when writing on May 28. Meanwhile, Ethereum is perched at second.\n\nAlthough it has been one of the top performers in the last week, stretching gains versus Bitcoin, each coin is changing hands for over $3,800. It has a market cap of over $465 billion at this level.\n\nComparing the two, Bitcoin is roughly three times more valuable than Ethereum. Even with the larger market cap, derived from its first mover advantage, one analyst thinks Ethereum is superior.\n\nFor instance, the observer said Ethereum has a significantly larger user base than Bitcoin. The broader user base is because developers can launch protocols on the platform. Some of the most popular ones, like Uniswap and Aave, generate more daily fees than Bitcoin.\n\nBesides this, the analyst said Ethereum serves as a store of value and a medium of exchange. These features give it more edge than Bitcoin, which purely exists as a transactional layer for moving value trustlessly and cheaply across borders.\n\nFrom an infrastructure perspective, the analyst argues that being an Ethereum validator is easier than running a Bitcoin mining rig. Over 1.9 million Ethereum validators have staked at least 32 ETH for a chance to validate a block of transactions and earn rewards. On the other hand, Bitcoin mining requires specialized hardware. Mining rigs are usually expensive and scarce.\n\n\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF Listings Approval And The Security Question\n\nWhile the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing is bullish, whether ETH is a security or a commodity remains to be clarified. Bitcoin, by comparison, enjoys a clearer designation as a commodity.\n\nThe United States SEC has not explicitly declared ETH a security. However, ConsenSys recently sued the agency, claiming they considered ETH a security internally. There is a clash since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a sister agency to the SEC, categorizes ETH as a commodity.\n\nEven as the debate rages on, analysts claim it would be endorsing ETH as a commodity if the commission approves form S-1 for registration.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView"

Eight spot Ethereum ETF applications were greenlit by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom criticism to growing supporter\n\nEarlier in May, Michael Saylor expressed strong criticism of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies below the \"Bitcoin stack.\" According to Michael Saylor, these digital currencies are investment contracts, adding that assets like Ethereum will never be wrapped in spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThree weeks after he made this statement, spot Ethereum ETFs were approved by the U.S. SEC; however, trading is yet to commence. In a recent interview with Beagle, the host of \"What Bitcoin Did,\" Saylor said Ethereum ETFs and any other product tracking most crypto is not bad after all.\n\nIn his interview post Ethereum ETF approval, Michael Saylor completely reframes his narrative to say that the Ethereum ETF approval is a GOOD thing for Bitcoin because it makes the entire asset class bigger and thus more money can flow into Bitcoin. \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/TxSduvRp9C \u2014 Autism Capital \ud83e\udde9 (@AutismCapital) May 26, 2024\n\nHe said that with other related products, more investors will make their way into the broader crypto market. According to him, this will help validate Bitcoin as the dominant asset in the industry.\n\nMichael Saylor earned a lot of criticism for his earlier statement, with the likes of Charles Hoskinson slamming him for what he perceived as an unhealthy view of the industry. Already, the change in stance is being called out, seeing the failed prediction that has already come to pass.\n\nPlace of Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nThe process leading up to the spot Ethereum ETF approval brought with it a lot of speculation. Now that the approval has been secured, there is still the unspoken question of whether Ethereum is a security or not.\n\nMichael Saylor has remained a major backer of Bitcoin since August 2020 with a consistent accumulation to date. While it remains uncertain whether he would be betting on Ethereum, the industry seeks to see how Wall Street accepts the new ETF, which is yet to start trading."

        "content": "With the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States, all eyes are on when they will go live. Now, several experts have shared their predictions as to when the highly-anticipated investment offering could launch.\n\nThe crypto-based ETF follows Bitcoin as the second asset to be granted approval in the country. However, the ETH iteration of the product has yet to launch, with the market awaiting that moment. Subsequently, a few prominent crypto voices have given their best estimations on that impending moment and presented a timeline.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin: Michael Saylor Reacts To Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nExperts Predict When Spot Ethereum ETF Will Go Live\n\nOver the past several months, all eyes have been on the application process for Ethereum ETFs. The market had been awaiting a decision, with the SEC surprisingly switching its stance, and greenlighting the offering this month. However, it has not officially gone live, with the industry pondering a potential timetable.\n\nNow, several industry experts have discussed the Spot Ethereum ETFs and when a launch could officially take place. Specifically, Nate Geraci of the ETF Prime podcast discussed a timetable for the product\u2019s official arrival. In a post to X (formerly Twitter), Geraci said that \u201cnobody knows fo sure, but my expectation would be [the] next few weeks.\u201d\n\nGeraci stated that the launch of the Ethereum ETF would take place in \u201c2-3 months max.\u201d Additionally, he stated that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d was already done after Spot BTC ETFs debuted this year.

Specifically, Balchunas remarked, \u201cJuly 4th feels like a good over/under.\u201d Overall, it showcases that the industry is anticipating the launch to take place within the next two weeks.\n\nStill, for the product to officially go live, there is a requirement for S-1 approvals. This part of the process appears to be what is holding up the launch of the ETFs, as it is vital to the registration of securities with the SEC. Although the next several weeks appear to be an appropriate timeline, the process is still facing some uncertainties regarding its eventual launch."

Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum (ETH) price has surged by 5%, reaching $3,957, accompanied by a market cap of $469 billion. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volumes have witnessed a remarkable increase, soaring by 68% to nearly $17 billion.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Eyes Breakout Above $4,000\n\nRekt Capital, a prominent crypto analyst, stated that Ethereum (ETH) requires a weekly close above $3956 to move into the $4000+ range. Currently, ETH is forming a lower high, but it has spent significant time around the $2791 level, historically a precursor to an upside movement back to approximately $4000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRekt Capital emphasized that a weekly close above the orange box level is inevitable and will confirm that the bulls have regained momentum. The analyst\u2019s observations highlight the critical thresholds ETH must surpass to continue its bullish trajectory.\n\nSoon after the news of the spot Ether ETF last week, the ETH price consolidated for a while before resuming the recent uptrend.

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF S-1 Approval Potential Date Revealed, Here\u2019s Everything - CoinGape",
        "content": "The potential S-1 approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs has become a hot topic within the crypto community. Hence, various industry experts have shared their insights on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might give the green light. Nate Geraci, host of the ETF Prime podcast, recently expressed that the S-1 approvals could come within a few weeks.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF S-1 Approval Potential Timeline\n\nIn a post on X, Geraci stated, \u201cWhen will SEC approve spot eth ETF registration statements? *Nobody* knows for sure, but my expectation would be next few weeks. 2-3 months max.\u201d Moreover, Geraci believes that the approval process for Spot Ethereum ETFs could be expedited owing to swift ETF approval for Bitcoin previously.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition, he argued that the SEC has already done much of the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d with the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum futures ETFs. Therefore, he suggests, it may just be \u201ca matter of how long SEC wants to string this out.\u201d\n\nWhilst, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, engaged with Geraci\u2019s post. He proposed a potential Ether ETF S-1 approval timeline around July 4, 2024. Balchunas stated, \u201cJuly 4th feels like a good over/under.\u201d Geraci concurred, adding, \u201cI like it\u2026 I\u2019ll take under, but right timeframe IMO.\u201d\n\nHence, it can be rightly said that the S-1 approvals could take more than a month for approval. Though the greenlight wouldn\u2019t be as swift as in the case of Bitcoin ETFs, it\u2019s still quite early considering the debate around Ethereum\u2019s status and other regulatory implications. Thus, there are very low chances of the commencement of Spot Ethereum ETF trading in the coming month.\n\nAlso Read: Why Is Ethereum Price Going Up? ETH Soars To $3,900 As ETF Hype Escalates\n\nReason For Delay In Launch\n\nThe above-mentioned exchange follows Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\u2019s detailed exposition on the approval process. Earlier, Seyffart emphasized the difference between SEC approval and the actual ETF launch. The 19b-4 filings for eight Spot Ethereum ETFs were approved on May 23.\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that the next critical step involves the approval of the S-1 forms, which might take longer. He explained, \u201cWe also need S-1 approvals. It could be weeks to months before we see S-1 approvals and thus a live Eth ETF.\u201d\n\nSeyffart highlighted the misconception that approval of the 19b-4 and S-1 forms would happen simultaneously, as it did with the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Moreover, he clarified that the SEC\u2019s approval of these forms typically involves a minimum time gap before the actual launch of the products.\n\nThis process requires bi-directional communication between the regulator and the applicants, a dynamic that only started this week. In the case of Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, this interaction spanned several weeks. Given this context, the timeline for the approval and subsequent launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain.\n\nHowever, the optimism shared by experts like Geraci and Balchunas suggests that the financial community could see significant progress in the coming months. As Geraci noted, the SEC has already navigated the complexities of similar ETF approvals, which might streamline the current process for Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF Approvals Poised to Spur Long-Term Growth: Kaiko\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 6 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paves the way for broader institutional adoption and increased exposure of digital assets to traditional investors. Since the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, eyes have been on Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization. Now that Ethereum ETFs have received the green light, the market is buzzing, anticipating a new wave of massive investments. This new investment opportunity could transform market dynamics and provide significant benefits not only to Ethereum but also to several other cryptos closely linked to its ecosystem. In this article, we will explore the three cryptos best positioned to benefit from this approval of Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has already seen a dramatic rise since the beginning of the year and even in recent days. Currently, the price of ETH is around USD 3,801.94, with a market capitalization of nearly 456 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding 10 billion dollars. Despite this impressive growth, the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC opens the door to an even more significant increase in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nThe approval of ETFs means that institutional investors, who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market due to its complexity and perceived risks, can now invest in Ethereum through traditional and regulated financial channels. This will significantly increase the potential demand for ETH. The legitimacy brought by SEC approval will enhance investor confidence in Ethereum, thereby stimulating interest and purchase of ETH.\n\nThe influx of new capital into Ethereum through ETFs will also improve market liquidity. Better liquidity means that transactions can be executed more quickly and with less volatility, which is attractive to large investors. This increase in liquidity can stabilize Ethereum\u2019s price in the short term while creating a solid foundation for continued growth.\n\nPolygon (MATIC)\n\nPolygon is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Currently, the price of the Polygon crypto is around USD 0.7225 with a market capitalization of 7.15 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of nearly 175 million dollars. Polygon has already demonstrated notable growth as a scaling platform, attracting the attention of blockchain developers and users.\n\nThe recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC has the potential to catalyze a new wave of adoption and use of Ethereum. As demand for Ethereum increases, scaling solutions become crucial to manage the growing volume of transactions on the network. Polygon, as the main layer 2 solution for Ethereum, is particularly well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic.\n\nPolygon improves Ethereum\u2019s scalability by enabling faster and cheaper transactions, which is essential to maintaining the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency in the face of growing demand. With the expected influx of capital following ETF approval, Ethereum users will seek ways to reduce transaction costs and improve transaction speed, thereby increasing demand for Polygon.\n\nMoreover, Polygon benefits from its compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing developers to easily deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects on its platform. This compatibility already attracts a multitude of projects, and the increased interest in Ethereum due to ETFs could strengthen this trend, attracting even more developers and users to Polygon.\n\nUniswap (UNI)\n\nUniswap, the leading decentralized trading platform (DEX) on Ethereum, plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by allowing users to trade cryptos directly without going through a centralized exchange. Currently, the price of its crypto UNI is USD 11.40, with a market capitalization of 6.83 billion dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of nearly 473 million dollars.\n\nWith the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC, Uniswap is in an advantageous position to benefit from the influx of capital and increased interest in Ethereum. ETFs make buying Ethereum more accessible to institutional investors, which should increase demand for ETH. This increase in demand will also lead to an increase in transactions on Ethereum, which directly benefits decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap.\n\nAs the most popular decentralized trading platform, Uniswap is likely to see a significant increase in trading volumes. The higher the trading volumes, the better the liquidity on Uniswap, making trades more efficient and attractive to investors. This could lead to an increase in the value of the UNI crypto, used for governance and liquidity rewards on the platform.\n\nWith the approval of Ethereum ETFs, Ethereum, Polygon, and Uniswap are three cryptos particularly well-positioned to benefit from this influx of capital and increased interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the crypto market is extremely volatile, and prices can fluctuate unpredictably. Nothing is very certain!\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "\n\n\n\nMicroStrategy's Chair, Michael Saylor, views the SEC's approval of a spot Ethereum ETF as a positive development for Bitcoin. He anticipates this move will draw more institutional investors into the crypto market.\n\n\n\nIn early May, Saylor expressed concerns about the SEC potentially taking action against significant alternative crypto assets (altcoins). This raised worries within the crypto community that the SEC might classify Ethereum ETF and other altcoins as securities, leading to stricter regulations and potential limitations on trading these assets.\n\n\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the SEC's approval of all spot Ethereum ETFs differed from earlier expectations. Michael Saylor has adjusted his previous stance and now welcomes the SEC's decision.\n\n\n\nFollowing the SEC's approval of several spot Ethereum ETFs in late May, Saylor expressed his belief that this development could be even more beneficial for Bitcoin. He suggested that the broader recognition of crypto as an asset class, facilitated by the ETFs, would strengthen Bitcoin's position within the industry due to its established presence. He further indicated that these ETFs might act as a stabilising factor for Bitcoin in the regulatory landscape.\n\n\n\nSaylor further emphasised that the SEC's decision could accelerate institutional investors' adoption of crypto assets. This could lead to a potential allocation of 5-10% of their investment portfolios towards cryptocurrencies. Within this allocation, he projects Bitcoin to capture a significant share, potentially around 60-70 percent, due to its established position in the market. He explained this by suggesting that previously hesitant investors might now view crypto as a legitimate asset class due to the existence of ETFs. Saylor anticipated that these investors would likely diversify their crypto assets holdings. Still, Bitcoin, as the established leader in the space, would likely receive the largest share of their crypto assets allocations.\n\n\n\nSaylor elaborated that just two weeks prior to the SEC's decision, the expectation was that Bitcoin would be the sole cryptocurrency offered as a security through a spot ETF by Wall Street institutions, effectively solidifying its position as the only legitimate crypto asset class.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) has seen a significant price surge over the past week, rising more than 27% and breaking out of a falling wedge chart pattern. This breakout suggests a potential reversal from the previous downtrend and hints at the possibility of Ether reaching new all-time highs.\n\n\n\nThe falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern when the price makes lower highs and lower lows within a converging downtrend. The breakout from this pattern indicates that selling pressure is waning, and buyers are gaining control. Additionally, Ether has flipped key resistance areas into support, providing a solid base for further gains.\n\n\n\nThe recent price surge in Ethereum has also been accompanied by a decline in Bitcoin's dominance, suggesting that traders' attention is shifting towards Ether. Bitcoin's dominance, which measures Bitcoin's market share relative to the overall cryptocurrency market, has fallen over 0.98% in the past five days, while Ethereum's dominance has risen 4.4%. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum's dominance has increased by 1.45%, while Bitcoin's dominance has decreased by 0.57%.\n\n\n\nAnalysts are also bullish on Ethereum's potential to continue its upward trajectory, with some predicting that the cryptocurrency could reach as high as $4,500 before the launch of the first spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\n\n\nArthur Cheong, the founder and CEO of crypto-focused investment firm DeFiance Capital, believes that Ether could rally to the $4,500 mark before the first spot Ether ETFs start trading. In a May 26 post, Cheong tweeted on X that \u201c4.5k before spot ETF go live for trading imo\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum's price outlook is primarily driven by the recent developments around the potential approval of spot Ether ETFs in the U.S. On May 20, Ether's price rose nearly 20% within a day, following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has U-turned on spot Ether ETFs, possibly due to political pressure.\n\n\n\nAs of May 28, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at approximately $3,800, with a market capitalisation of USD 463.51 billion.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia.

This makes Ethereum more accessible which could have a positive impact on the number of people who buy it.\n\nWhen more people buy, the price tends to go up!\n\nIn this post, we will explore whether or not Ethereum is a good investment to consider right now.\n\nAlthough the approval of the ETF was great news for the crypto, there are also some potential risks to consider before you make any decisions.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in and take a look at whether Ethereum is worth your attention in 2024!\n\nIf you\u2019re sitting there scratching your head, don\u2019t worry! We will also explain what an Ethereum ETF is and why the recent approval was important.\n\nWhat is an Ethereum ETF?\n\nAn Ethereum ETF is a fund that tracks the performance of Ethereum. Just like other exchange-traded products, Ethereum ETFs allow you to gain exposure to Ethereum without owning the underlying asset.\n\nRecently, the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs offered by BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, Arc, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton.\n\nThis means that investors will be able to invest in Ethereum through these brokerages via funds that track the underlying price.\n\nBut, what is Ethereum?\n\nIt\u2019s all very well explaining the ins and outs of an Ethereum ETF however, that won\u2019t get you anywhere if you don\u2019t understand Ethereum!\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency. More importantly, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap (after Bitcoin).\n\nThe token itself is actually called \u2018Ether\u2019 and \u2018Ethereum\u2019 is the blockchain network that it is built on.\n\nEthereum was created as a sustainable alternative to Bitcoin. It is much less energy-intensive, faster, and cheaper to run!\n\nDue to it\u2019s high speeds and scalability, Ethereum is used to build a LOT of applications in the web3 space. So, it\u2019s pretty important!\n\nAlso see: What is Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\n\nHow might the approval of an Ethereum ETF affect the price of Ether?\n\nCrypto analysts are very optimistic about the impact that the ETF will have on the price of Ethereum. In fact, the CEO of Jumper.Exchange recently revealed that the approval could lead to a price rally of up to 60%!\n\nThe main reason that the launch of an Ethereum ETF will have such a positive impact on the price of Ether is that it will make Ethereum more accessible.\n\nFurthermore, the approval of the ETF will generate positive market sentiment, which is never a bad thing!\n\nEssentially, Ethereum ETFs will encourage more investors to add Ethereum assets to their portfolios which could put upward pressure on the price.\n\nAlthough the ETF will not affect the price of Ethereum directly. There will be an increased purchasing of Ethereum by the ETFs which will affect the demand for the crypto.\n\nThe bulk of the rally is expected to occur shortly after the first Ethereum ETF is launched for trading. But, the event could also cause long-term growth for the crypto.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Ethereum?\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum ETF caused a surge of optimism around Ethereum. But, is it really a good time to invest?\n\nPast performance of crypto ETFs\n\nEthereum is not the first cryptocurrency to bag itself an ETF. Bitcoin did the same thing in January.\n\nOne good way to understand how Ethereum might respond to the ETF is to look at Bitcoin\u2019s performance.\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, the price of Bitcoin dropped after the initial ETF announcement in January. This was due to confusion, regulatory warnings, and investors taking short-term profits.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take long for the coin to experience a rally just weeks later. The initial drop was spurred by early investors bagging their profits and it took time for the effects of the ETF to kick in.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that some of the rally could have been due to the recent halving event. There is no such event in sight for Ethereum which means that it might not experience the same bullish gains as Bitcoin.\n\nAs for the Bitcoin ETFs themselves, they were relatively popular amongst investors. In particular, the iShares Bitcoin Trust managed to hit $10 billion is assets in just 2 months!\n\nThe popularity of crypto ETFs is likely to increase with the growing adoption of cryptocurrency. The assets are framed as the \u2018beginner-friendly\u2019 way to get into crypto.\n\nEthereum ETFs have the potential to be more appealing than Bitcoin ETFs due to the impact that Bitcoin mining has on the environment.\n\nEthereum price predictions\n\nThe cryptocurrency market attracts a lot of analysts who regularly share their price forecasts and predictions online. These can be a good way to understand what other people think of crypto.\n\nAccording to a price prediction published by Forbes, Ethereum has the potential to perform well this year. The blockchain network will undergo several major upgrades that will increase efficiency and make the network more attractive.\n\nThe price of Ethereum could also be influenced by macro-economic events (a fancy word for \u2018large scale events\u2019) such as the wider adoption of cryptocurrency, which seems to be growing each year!\n\nAs more people invest in crypto, the price of Ether is likely to move upwards. This is because it is the second-largest crypto by market cap and one of the most attractive options for investors.\n\nGrowing rates of adoption will also increase the demand for the Ethereum blockchain technology, which is used to power a significant number of applications and crypto products.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nWow, isn\u2019t that a lot of information to take in?\n\nIn a nutshell, I believe that now could be a good time to consider investing in Ethereum (and crypto in general).\n\nThis is because:\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs will attract new investors.\n\nEthereum is due to undergo a major upgrade later this year which will make the technology more attractive.\n\nEthereum will benefit from the wider adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, it is also really important to be aware of the risks that are involved in buying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe price of crypto tokens can be highly volatile which means that the price can experience large movements in a short period of time. This makes it difficult to accurately predict future performance.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum also involves using exchanges that may not be regulated to the same extent that stock exchanges are. Try to stick to reputable platforms that have positive reviews and follow strict security measures.\n\nAlthough many people believe that the future of Ethereum is positive, there is no guarantee that the value of your investment will go up. The price of Ethereum could drop if investor sentiment turns negative and demand takes a hit.\n\nTo learn more about investing sign up for our fortnightly MoneyMagpie Investing Newsletter.

        "content": "Michael Saylor makes a U-turn on ETH after ETF approvals.\n\nThe executive said that the approval will further legitimize crypto assets.\n\nMicroStrategy founder and CEO Michael Saylor has changed his \u2018no second best to Bitcoin\u2019 rhetoric after the Ethereum ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nCommenting on the approvals, Saylor underscored the update as \u2018good for crypto asset class\u2019 but \u2018better\u2019 for Bitcoin [BTC].\n\n\u2018Is this good for Bitcoin or not? It\u2019s good for Bitcoin. In fact, it may be better for Bitcoin because we\u2019re politically much more powerful, supported by the entire crypto industry.\u2019\n\nThe \u2018politically more powerful\u2019 phrase may refer to the current political changes triggered by crypto regulations, the passage of the US CBDC ban, and the FIT21 Act.\n\nMichael Saylor added that the ETH ETF approval will further legitimize the crypto asset class.\n\nMichael Saylor warm ups to ETH\n\nContrary to the above relative warm-up to ETH ETF approval, Saylor has always been a Bitcoin maxi and a critic of altcoins.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, the executive believed that Bitcoin would be the only approved crypto asset with a spot ETF and backing of Wall Street and TradFi.\n\nThe executive expected the SEC to reject the ETH ETFs. Here, it can be argued that Saylor changed his strict stance against other crypto assets after the ETH ETF approvals.\n\nHowever, his emphasis that BTC could benefit more from the ETH ETF adds to the divergent views on the topic.\n\nSome industry analysts, like Jim Bianco and Quinn Thompson, have reiterated that ETH ETF could draw inflows from spot BTC ETFs.\n\nAs a result, the ETH ETF launch could be negative to BTC. In fact, Bianco projected that ETH could even flip BTC before the next halving.\n\nHowever, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan downplayed the \u2018threat\u2019 and mentioned that ETH ETF will hit billions but won\u2019t match BTC.\n\nIn the meantime, the recent positive regulatory relief and ETH ETF approvals saw BTC ETFs record positive net inflows last week.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Soso Value\u2019s data, the investment products saw a total of $819.5 million last week.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these BTC ETF flows will be affected by ETH ETFs when they launch and start trading."

        "content": "After the US SEC asked exchanges to fine-tune their Ether ETF filings, market experts are almost certain that approval is on the way. Just like it was with Bitcoin, the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is expected to be the next big thing in the crypto market.Standard Chartered, agreeing that Ethereum will receive the green light for spot ETFs soon, has updated its price target for the leading altcoin. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s Head of FX Research and Digital Assets Research, believes ETH could peak at $8,000 by the end of the year.According to Geoff Kendrick, spot Ethereum ETFs will drive inflows of $15 billion to $45 billion within the first 12 months. This inflow of capital is what is expected to be the driving force behind the next major move in the crypto market.Ethereum undoubtedly could play a massive role in this year\u2019s crypto winter, but there are other cryptos that are set to record bigger gains. Based on the predictions from top experts, KangaMoon , Chainlink, VeChain, Dogecoin, and Chiliz are some of the best cryptos to buy for more profits than Ethereum. Let\u2019s find out why.KangaMoon (KANG), the presale sensation of 2024, is one of the top altcoins predicted to shine in this altcoin season. The KangaMoon community has quickly grown to over 32,000, and over $7 million has been raised to create the most community-centric project.The aim of the project is simple: building and rewarding a lively community of people with similar interests in crypto games, meme culture, and engagements. Social-Fi, a new protocol, will power KangaMoon to reward users based on their level of engagement.KangaMoon has also partnered with RaidSharks to launch a community engagement bot that will add more flavour to the ecosystem. In addition, KangaMoon features a metaverse, \u2018Kangaverse\u2019 where players will be able to play selected crypto games, develop as well as level up their characters, and sell them for money.The unique approach of KangaMoon has made it a favourite in the crypto community. The price of KANG, its native token, has already increased by 400% this year to hit $0.025. The potential surge to $1 makes KANG the best crypto investment of the year.The decentralised oracle network Chainlink (LINK) is one of the top altcoins with a very bullish outlook in 2024. According to the pseudonymous trader, Immortal , all LINK needs to do to prepare for a massive price increase is remain above the $16 support level.The Chainlink price has held this support level since recovering it in mid-May. According to Immortal\u2019s analysis, LINK could explode to $28 by September. However, the long-term Chainlink price prediction suggests that LINK could hit $40 by December, levels the altcoin last recorded in May 2021.In a recent tweet, crypto exchange Bitget announced that it had listed VeChain (VET) on its platform. While the news has failed to spark a bullish move for VeChain, market analyst Crypto EA remains optimistic about the potential of VET this crypto summer.The analyst explained that VET recently touched the lower level of its Bollinger Bands (BB), resulting in the recent VeChain price pump. Based on his predictions, VET could target the higher level in this bull cycle. If VeChain follows through with this trend, the altcoin price could rise by at least 500% to hit $0.18. CryptoEA, however, believes VET could top out at $0.5 in this bull cycle.According to the pseudonymous analyst known as the Flow Horse, spot ETH ETFs would make the crypto markets \u2018get crazier.\u2019 While the ETH altcoin price could see a major pump in price, Flow Horse is even more bullish about Dogecoin (DOGE).He notes that Dogecoin has been \u2018sitting in a really nice area for long,\u2019 and could be activated by the ETF approval. Based on the chart shared by Flow Horse, the Dogecoin price could pump towards $0.60 this bull cycle, an increase of more than 4x from its current range at $0.1600.Chiliz (CHZ) is one of the top altcoins already benefiting from the momentum Ethereum has been building. According to Santiment, the leading blockchain platform focused on sports and entertainment, is one of the altcoins seeing a surge in whale activity. The surging whale activity comes as Naver Pay and the Chiliz enter into a partnership to launch exclusive ticketing and payment services.With the potential to increase the Chiliz crypto, whales seem very optimistic that the price of CHZ could be on the rise. From its current range at $0.120, a Chiliz price prediction suggests that CHZ could hit a yearly high of $0.60 before this bull cycle is over.With Ethereum predicted to experience the same kind of rally as Bitcoin did after its ETF approval, it\u2019s a no-brainer why ETH is one of the best coins to invest in now. However, while it could be the face of this crypto summer, predictions from experts suggest other altcoins will end up with bigger gains.Standard Chartered\u2019s $8,000 prediction suggests the price of ETH will increase by 2.1x before the end of the year. Meanwhile, CHZ and VET could see an increase of 5x, and DOGE a rise of 400%. However, the best crypto investment for this year remains KANG, with a potential rise of 50x.While ETH prepares to lead another crypto bull market, LINK, CHZ, VET, and DOGE are some of the topcoins to invest in for bigger returns. Meanwhile, the top option remains KangaMoon as its unique new platform could fuel the biggest rally of the year.Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) Presale Today!The above content is non-editorial, and TIL (Times Internet Limited) hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

        "content": "Let\u2019s see in this article how the top 2 cryptocurrencies in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are moving, and their price predictions.\n\nSembra che in questa fase sia Ethereum la vera protagonista delle borse crittografiche, con l\u2019attenzione degli investitori che \u00e8 canalizzata attorno alla questione ETF spot ETH, mentre Bitcoin segue i rialzi della regina.\n\nWhat are the short and medium-term forecasts? Are we about to attack new historical highs in both assets?\n\nAll the details below.\n\nAnalysis and forecasts of the crypto market price: Bitcoin supported by the news of Ethereum ETFs\n\nOn this Monday, May 27th, Bitcoin records a price of 68,500 dollars, slightly down by 1% compared to the last 24 hours but up by about 9% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe king of the crypto market has managed to bounce back very well from the recent retracement, thanks especially to the news that involved the issue of Ethereum spot ETFs on Wall Street, approved officially on May 23 by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBTC reports a market capitalization of 1.4 trillion dollars, volumes in the last 24 hours equal to 18.8 billion dollars, and dominance at 52.5%.\n\nI prezzi si trovano ben al di sopra dell\u2019EMA 50 daily con un RSI14 a 57 punti, in un pausa dalla foga delle speculazioni, in attesa che la domanda torni a spingere riportando la moneta sopra i 70.000 dollari ed oltre.\n\nThe prices are well above the EMA 50 daily with an RSI14 at 57 points, in a pause from the frenzy of speculations, waiting for the demand to push the currency back above 70,000 dollars and beyond.\n\nThe short-term forecasts indicate a strong probability of a continuation of the lateral trend, with the quotations likely oscillating within the trading range of 61,000-71,500 dollars in the coming days.\n\nIn any case, it seems more likely that, should the market take a clear direction shortly, the path will be that of the bull.\n\nWe remind you that today the US stock market is closed on the occasion of \u201cMemorial Day\u201d, therefore we might witness relatively reduced volatility during these hours.\n\nDaily chart of Bitcoin price (BTC/USD), Coinbase market\n\nBitcoin is supported by the enthusiasm of the crypto market for Ethereum spot ETFs, which is monopolizing the attention of investors.\n\nSince Bloomberg analysts increased the approval estimates of this investment instrument on May 20, BTC has grown by about 3%, even reaching the resistance of 71,500 dollars before a slight price drop.\n\nRegarding this event so disruptive for the future of Ethereum and many other tokens developed within it, Michael Saylor expressed his enthusiasm about how all this could have a positively implicit impact also for Bitcoin.\n\nDespite always declaring himself against Ethereum, this time he stated in a recent interview that the approval of exchange-traded funds on ETH \u201cmakes the entire asset class bigger and therefore more money can flow into Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn his interview post Ethereum ETF approval, Michael Saylor completely reframes his narrative to say that the Ethereum ETF approval is a GOOD thing for Bitcoin because it makes the entire asset class bigger and thus more money can flow into Bitcoin. \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/TxSduvRp9C \u2014 Autism Capital \ud83e\udde9 (@AutismCapital) May 26, 2024\n\nIn the meantime, however, Bitcoin ETFs also continue to churn out encouraging numbers with funds on Wall Street that have recorded so far inflow of 13.68 billion dollars.\n\nAs a positive note, we highlight that Grayscale seems to have interrupted the trend of sales that characterized the recent price declines of the asset, while Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark continue to increase their market share by adding satoshi to their respective holdings.\n\nIn particular BlackRock with its IBIT is about to match the numbers of Grayscale and its GBTC fund, having come to hold over 280,000 BTC for a value of almost 20 billion dollars.\n\nBlackrock's $IBIT now has nearly $20B worth of #Bitcoin sitting in it.\n\n\n\nThis is at basically the same level as Grayscale's $GBTC and will likely be far ahead by the end of the year. https://t.co/J8NZsBWoVo pic.twitter.com/H60VceqkwV \u2014 Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) May 27, 2024\n\nETH Price Prediction: attack on 4,000 dollars\n\nAs mentioned, at this moment the true protagonist of the price evolution in the crypto market is Ethereum, which graphically seems to be in a much better position compared to the king Bitcoin.\n\nWith a clearly bullish pattern, the quotations are currently at 3,917 dollars, up by 3.2% in the last 24 hours and by 25.6% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe market capitalization is equal to 470 billion dollars, with volumes in the last 24 hours of 18 billion dollars and a dominance of 18.3%.\n\nSince May 20, the day when the ETF narrative became decidedly hotter, the coin has surged by 27%, suddenly changing the sentiment of investors who until then were much more negative about short-term price forecasts.\n\nNow Ethereum is on the road to break 4,000 dollars and attack the local high located in the 40,091 dollars area, to then aim for the ATH above 5,000 dollars.\n\nIn the short term, downward movements are not excluded, with prices that could easily return to 3,500 dollars, while still remaining in a positive momentum.\n\nL\u2019RSI14 \u00e8 appena entrato in zona iper comprata a 72,5 punti con un open interest ai massimi storici a circa 13 miliardi di dollari, come testimonianza della forza dell\u2019asset e dell\u2019attenzione degli investitori per le speculazioni.\n\nSembra che in questa fase in cui Ethereum viene acclamato dalla folla, con le previsioni che indicano un futuro radioso per la seconda criptovaluta del mercato, i bitcoiners maxi stanno cambiando le loro rigide prospettive.\n\nGente del calibro di Jack Mallers, CEO e fondatore di Strike, che in precedenza aveva definitivo Ethereum come una \u201croba schifosa\u201d ora la definisce come una \u201ctecnologia\u201d pur mantenendo la preferenza verso Bitcoin come forma di riserva di valore mondiale.\n\nJACK MALLERS: When I call Ethereum a piece of crap, maybe I\u2019m being a bit aggressive but I think it\u2019s distinctly different from #Bitcoin\u2013 I think #Bitcoin can be the world reserve asset, Ethereum is a technology. pic.twitter.com/xHNAHwAN4H \u2014 Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) May 22, 2024\n\nWe remain waiting to discover when the SEC will approve the S-1 documents for the issuers of the ETH exchange-traded funds (it is now only a matter of time) to be able to make further assessments on the state of the asset market.\n\nIf the listing were to have the same effect recorded on Bitcoin for the launch of BTC ETFs, we could expect weak price action in the first two weeks, followed by a price pump in the following months with quotations that could soar up to 8,000 dollars by the end of 2024.\n\nIn a context like this, even the altcoin would benefit from fertile ground to fuel speculations and the influx of new resources into the market."

        "content": "The innovative team from Ottawa is getting ready to take over the world and revolutionize the NFT game with their platform in the making. Who are the guys from Douche Ventures Ltd, and why should you remember that name?\n\nWhat is now known as Douche Ventures Ltd. started when two friends had the idea of creating digital art. One extra-long search for skilled partners and four people later, DBAG was created. Faouzi and Vincent, the two friends from the beginning of the story, managed to find the right teammates and a financial institution to help them bring their idea to life.\n\nThey created an NFT collection from scratch, developed smart contracts and the website, and ultimately turned their idea into reality. Now they have 20,000 DBAG NFTs and an ace up their sleeve \u2013 the MintAndTrade project. Their inspiring story serves as an example for anyone stuck in a rut and wanting to make a change.\n\nThis was a learning experience for everyone on the team. We all have different backgrounds and experiences and united together, we have been able to accomplish what many have failed to do. Our developers spent countless hours reading documents and discovering a new passion for smart contracts and blockchain technology.\n\nTheir NFTs are douchy by design \u2013 a full image including legs and feet. Their website has an integrated dashboard for people to view their All-Access Pass, NFT and Merch Vouchers. Their MintAndTrade platform will change the NFT world.\n\nDBAG Utility NFT\n\nDBAG is a utility NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and the launchpad for their exciting MintAndTrade project. There are 20,000 DBAG NFTs and they will all be available on July 8th, 2022 at 7 PM EST at 0.15 ETH.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about it is that all holders will benefit from staking their DBAG on the MintAndTrade platform.\n\nRarity\n\nEvery DBAG NFT has its own twist when it comes to rarity.

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nMichael Saylor, known for his status as a Bitcoin evangelist, recently surprised the crypto community by adopting a favorable stance towards Ethereum-based ETFs. This former Ethereum skeptic has not only revised his judgment but also predicted that this new asset class could accelerate institutional adoption of cryptos.\n\nMichael Saylor paves the way for Ethereum ETFs\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the podcast \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did,\u201d Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy and major Bitcoin evangelist, expressed unexpected support for Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). \u201cIn fact, this could be better for Bitcoin, as we are politically much more powerful\u2026 supported by the entire cryptocurrency industry\u201c, he stated. Saylor explained that traditional investors might now be more inclined to allocate a larger portion of their portfolios to crypto assets, from the current 1% to potentially 5% or 10%.\n\nThis statement marks a striking contrast with Saylor\u2019s previous positions, where he had categorically rejected the idea that Ethereum could be accepted by Wall Street. According to him, Bitcoin was the institutional-grade crypto. However, the recent reversal by the SEC, which has approved several Ethereum ETF listing applications, seems to have changed Saylor\u2019s perspective. This approval, considered unlikely just a few days ago, paves the way for increased institutional adoption of Ethereum ETFs and could redefine the cryptocurrency investment landscape.\n\nTowards a new era of institutional investments in cryptos?\n\nMichael Saylor\u2019s adoption of Ethereum ETFs could mark a decisive turning point for the crypto market. Indeed, his support could encourage other institutional investors to diversify their portfolios beyond Bitcoin. This dynamic could bolster the perception of Bitcoin as the asset of choice within a broader crypto asset class.\n\nThis change in position from one of the most ardent Bitcoin proponents also raises questions about the future coexistence and complementarity of different cryptos in institutional portfolios. If Bitcoin remains the primary asset, the growing acceptance of Ethereum and other altcoins could lead to a reevaluation of investment strategies. In conclusion, Saylor\u2019s support for Ethereum ETFs could well be the catalyst for a new era of institutional investment in cryptos and profoundly transform the financial landscape.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Mon 27 May 2024 \u25aa 7 min read \u25aa by Laetitia B.\n\nEach bull run in the past has gone through different phases stimulated by a capital rotation. In general, bitcoin is often the leader of the bull run and the favorite in the early phases. Following Ethereum\u2019s weaker performance compared to bitcoin, we will look at the factors favorable to a capital rotation towards Ethereum.\n\nThe Principle of Asset Rotation\n\nIn traditional finance, there are several types of asset rotations. This can involve a sectoral rotation (technology, industrial, financial, health\u2026) or a rotation of asset types (bonds, stocks, commodities, forex\u2026). Capitals move according to the context and the economy. The rotation can come from profit-taking after a significant performance to move into another sector or a less valued type of asset while following the economic context. This is often the case between cyclical and defensive sectors, for example.\n\nLet\u2019s also take an example over a very long-term horizon, that is to say over several decades, we can see this cyclical rotation between commodities and the S&P500 index in the graph below:\n\nThis type of graph highlights that in the coming years, performances in commodities should be more advantageous than in the S&P500.\n\nThe Different Phases in Crypto\n\nWhen we look at the cryptocurrency market, there are several phases in terms of rotation, whether it is between bitcoin, Ethereum, large caps, and altcoins. And generally, this comes from a progressive rotation.\n\nPhase 1: Bitcoin is the leader, the store of value in the crypto market. It is the oldest and most democratized in the cryptocurrency sphere. It is on bitcoin that the first capital inflows arrive at the beginning of a bull market. Since 2024, bitcoin has been available in spot ETF form, which is an advantage to stimulate demand. And in parallel, when the demand is stimulated, it increases the capital inflows. During phase 1, bitcoin tends to outperform Ethereum. And it is only when Ethereum starts to approach bitcoin\u2019s performance that phase 2 is near. We can possibly see this rotation with the example below which highlights the ETC/BTC ratio:\n\nPhase 2: Ethereum, which is the number 2 cryptocurrency in the crypto sphere, outperforms bitcoin. This can be seen in the graph below with the 2021 bull run.\n\nPhase 3: It is the turn of large capitalizations (Doge, LTC, XRP\u2026) to outperform bitcoin.\n\nPhase 4: The altcoin season begins when there is a large capital rotation. That is to say, the money invested in bitcoin at the beginning of the bull run moves to other cryptocurrencies, small and mid-capitalizations, or even memes. During the altcoin season, we see a reduction in bitcoin dominance. Here is a graph that highlights this:\n\nTo better illustrate this in general terms, here is the chronology below:\n\nThe Economic Environment and Different Phases in Cryptocurrency Markets\n\nThe evolution of cryptocurrency is quite cyclical, just like the economy. That is to say, we find cycles of growth and cycles of decline. Like any riskier asset class, it evolves according to a favorable and accommodating context. A favorable context can be defined in several ways. For example, when growth rebounds, we have an acceleration of growth, which is a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. Consumer sentiment is positive and this encourages capital inflows. Conversely, when we face an economic slowdown, it is often represented by a bear market in cryptocurrencies. Each cycle often averages one and a half to two years, just like economic cycles. Therefore, if we add up a bull market and a bear market, it represents 4 years, just like the halving process:\n\nAnother positive element for performance is also liquidity. When liquidity is abundant, cryptocurrencies thrive. For example, injections of liquidity during COVID led to more capital circulating in the markets. Financial conditions were highly relaxed. Therefore, more money in circulation to buy the same good implies a price increase.\n\nRegarding liquidity in the current situation, we can see the graph below highlighting the evolution of liquidity and bitcoin:\n\nRemaining in the same context, that is, liquidity, we can also see favorable seasons (summer and fall being the best):\n\nThe Delay of Ethereum Explained by Several Factors\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Ethereum is often delayed compared to bitcoin during the first months of a bull run. This is mainly because capital first flows into bitcoin, the store of value. As for Ethereum, it is no longer the only one well-positioned as it is closely followed by Solana. This also implies competition. That said, like bitcoin, Ethereum should benefit from more incoming flows since the approval of ETFs is official. Such products imply more potential to attract new investors, whether for tax reasons (introduction of the product into tax-advantaged accounts) or simply because an ETF is an easily accessible product (no need to open multiple brokerage accounts) and is inexpensive. This is why approval would be a good catalyst for catching up with bitcoin. Therefore, there are several arguments that align for Ethereum\u2019s outperformance, such as a favorable context, new available products, and the phase timeline (as indicated above).\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum, Which to Choose?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have different strengths that can help diversify a crypto portfolio. One of bitcoin\u2019s peculiarities is that it has a limited supply of 21 million, and its production is halved every 4 years. This can be seen as a safe haven, especially in countries suffering from hyperinflation. Ethereum also has certain peculiarities, such as the fact that it can be used to host other cryptos and decentralized applications.\n\nThe more adoption and democratization continue with the same dynamic, the more we will face new products as approvals will be increasingly easier. For example, we could have an ETF that brings together bitcoin and Ethereum to simplify the choice. This opens many possibilities in terms of capital.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe can conclude that the capital rotation system is cyclical and that Ethereum has several reasons to take the lead and outperform bitcoin for the rest of the cycle. One of the major catalysts for this would be, like bitcoin, ETF approval. This will improve liquidity in the coming months.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Ethereum whales have become more active recently.\n\nETH is attempting to establish the $3,600 range as its support.\n\nAnalysis revealed that before the Ethereum [ETH] ETF was approved, a particular whale address made bold moves by acquiring more ETH at a specific price level.\n\nAs a result, this address saw a significant unrealized profit. Additionally, further analysis showed a similar pattern among other whale addresses in the lead-up to the ETF approval.\n\nWhale acquires Ethereum and ecosystem tokens\n\nAn analysis by Lookonchain revealed that a particular whale wallet anticipated the approval of the Ethereum spot ETF and made a substantial purchase of ETH.\n\nThe data indicated that the whale acquired 8,733 ETH at approximately $3,054.56, totaling around $26.67 million. As a result, the whale wallet now holds approximately $6 million in unrealized profit.\n\nFollowing the approval of Form 19b-4 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the whale proceeded to purchase other tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem, amounting to $24.7 million.\n\nAmong these tokens is the Lido DAO [LDO] token, which represents the platform with the highest volume of ETH stakes. The unrealized profit for these ecosystem tokens in the wallet stands at around $1 million.\n\nEthereum whale activities increase\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum addresses holding 10,000 or more ETH revealed a significant movement in recent days.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, there had been declines in the number of such addresses before a trend reversal around the 19th of May.\n\nThe chart illustrated an increase in the number of addresses from around 997 to approximately 1,006 at the time of writing.\n\nFurther examination showed that the number of addresses holding $100,000 or more worth of ETH also experienced a notable surge.\n\nIn the same period, this figure rose from around 117,500 to over 140,000 as of the current writing.\n\nStaked ETH sees a slight decline\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at the total Ethereum staked indicated a brief decline, followed by an uptick around 20th May.\n\nAccording to the chart, it increased to over 32.5 million ETH from around 32.3 million ETH during this period. As of press time, the total ETH staked stood at around 32.56 million, with a slight decline observed.\n\nAlso, the current staked volume represented approximately 27.1% of the total Ethereum supply.\n\nEthereum maintains a bull run\n\nAs of press time, Ethereum was trading at approximately $3,790, reflecting an increase of over 1%. Analysis of the daily time frame chart indicated its efforts to sustain the $3,700 price range since it rose to that level.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe current trend suggested Ethereum\u2019s attempt to establish the $3,600 range as its support.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed Ethereum slightly below the overbought zone. This suggested a strong bullish trend but also implied the possibility of a decline, even amidst another potential bull run."

This marks a significant milestone for the crypto industry.\n\nJust a few days ago, many analysts did not anticipate such a decision, as the SEC had not discussed the applications with the involved parties.

All eight applicants received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to enable Ether-linked ETF trading: Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Ark/21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco Galaxy.\n\nThis could pave the way for trading such products later this year. But before trading can begin, providers must still clarify the details with regulatory authorities. An authorized S-1 filing, a comprehensive document containing information about the company's finances and risk profile, as well as the securities it plans to offer, will be necessary for this.\n\nUnexpected Market Reactions\n\nThis could be a reason why the price of Ether dropped by almost 6 percent after rising by 20 percent earlier in the week. However, most of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are also currently experiencing price losses.\n\nBig Brother Bitcoin\n\nThis is the SEC's second decision on exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the cryptocurrency space. After a long legal battle, the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs and ETPs in January 2024. According to BTC-ECHO, over $13 billion has flowed into Bitcoin-based ETFs in the last four months.\n\nWill the Ether ETFs be able to mirror Bitcoin ETFs?

The network is host to some of the largest and most well-known projects in the cryptocurrency space, including UniSwap, Curve, Chainlink and Decentraland.

Canadians, for their part, have had access to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs since 2021, and benefit from products from reputable providers to gain exposure.\n\nWith eyes on catching short-term gains tied to individual fund approvals by the SEC, as well as aligning yourself with crypto\u2019s potential for outsized long-term returns, let\u2019s break down how Canada\u2019s Ethereum ETFs stack up against one another.\n\nThe 3iQ Ether Staking ETF\n\nTicker: ETHQ.\n\nNet asset value: C$72.6 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 1.56%.\n\nDifferentiator: Unitholders can earn yield through Ethereum staking, which involves locking up investments in ETH to help to run the network. The fund was also first to market with staking capabilities.\n\nCI Galaxy Ethereum ETF\n\nTicker: ETHX.B.\n\nAssets under management: C$654.7 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.4%.\n\nDifferentiator: Galaxy is one of the pre-eminent crypto players across capital markets, asset management and infrastructure solutions.\n\nEvolve Ether ETF\n\nTicker: ETHR.\n\nAssets under management: C$91.8 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.75%.\n\nDifferentiator: The fund is the first in the world to offer exposure to the Ethereum network in the form of an ETF.\n\nFidelity Advantage Ether ETF Fund\n\nTicker: FETH.\n\nAssets under management: C$19.2 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: 0.95%.\n\nDifferentiator: Besides being one of the world\u2019s most well-respected financial institutions with more than 75 years of history and more than 50 million individual clients, Fidelity is also a crypto pioneer, having entered the industry all the way back in 2014.\n\nPurpose Ether ETF\n\nTicker: ETHH.\n\nAssets under management: C$478.7 million.\n\nManagement expense ratio: Up to 1.5%.\n\nDifferentiator: Investors who open a position in ETHH have the option to complement this exposure with the Purpose Ether Yield ETF (TSX:ETHY), which writes covered calls and currently pays out an annual yield of more than 9 per cent. Unlike ETHQ, whose yield is reflected in unit price appreciation, ETHY pays its distributions in cash.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a novice or an enthusiast, cryptocurrencies remain a new and volatile asset class with a little more than 15 years of market history, hardly enough for investors to expect reliable capital appreciation, despite the multitude of crypto millionaires who attract many retail participants into the space. This is why it\u2019s essential to have a plan for any dollars you intend to allocate, ensuring that you minimize avoidable regret through awareness of the range of possible outcomes.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out whether crypto suits your investment needs, check out last year\u2019s \u201cHow to invest in cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nJoin the discussion: Find out what everybody\u2019s saying about Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies on Stockhouse\u2019s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Bullboard, and check out the rest of Stockhouse\u2019s stock forums and message boards.\n\nThe material provided in this article is for information only and should not be treated as investment advice.

        "content": "If Grayscale\u2019s Ether Trust (ETHE) follows a similar pattern, it could experience average daily outflows of US$110 million, constituting 30% of ETH\u2019s average daily volume on Coinbase. ETHE, with an AUM of US$11 billion, is currently trading at a discount to its net asset value (NAV). This discount has been narrowing since the SEC signaled approval for spot Ether ETFs on May 23.\n\nOn May 1, ETHE traded at a 25% discount, which narrowed to a 1.28% discount by May 24 amid speculation and eventual partial approval by the SEC. Similar to GBTC, ETHE is expected to see outflows once it becomes a spot ETF as the discount narrows further."

        "title": "10,000 New Users Join Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrum Last Week, ARB Price Eyes $2 - CoinGape",
        "content": "As Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, rallies to $4,000, its Layer-2 platforms are also experiencing similar momentum. Arbitrum, a prominent Layer-2 platform, has seen a 5% increase, pushing its price past $1.25. Additionally, Arbitrum\u2019s daily trading volumes have surged by 113%, reaching $840 million.\n\n10,000 New Users Join Arbitrum Over the Last Week\n\nBased on the data showcased in the chart above, there were 1.5 million individual wallets holding ARB tokens as of the beginning of the week starting on May 20. As of the latest update on May 25, this number has climbed to 1.51 million ARB wallets.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis suggests that approximately 10,000 new users have joined the Arbitrum network within the span of this week. As these fresh participants engage in transactions, the increasing demand for ARB tokens may catalyze further price fluctuations.\n\nMoreover, with the anticipation of Ethereum ETF inflows on the horizon, a significant portion of the 1.51 million ARB investors are likely to retain their assets, expecting favorable outcomes from the influx of funds into the Ethereum L2 ecosystem.\n\nThe resultant reduction in sell-pressure coupled with the rising demand from new adopters could propel Arbitrum\u2019s price to advance towards the next significant milestone at $1.50.\n\nARB Price Action\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has been striving to surpass the overhead resistance of $1.27 in recent days, but the bears have managed to maintain their position.\n\nA minor positive for the bulls is that they have successfully prevented the price from falling below the 20-day EMA ($1.11). This increases the likelihood of a breakthrough above the resistance. Should this occur, the ARB/USDT pair is expected to gain momentum, potentially rising to $1.60 and eventually reaching $1.75.\n\nHowever, this optimistic outlook will be invalidated in the near term if the price declines sharply and falls below $1.10, which could drag the price down to the strong support around $0.90.\n\nThe Arbitrum price has been moving in tandem with Ethereu, Similar to ETH, ARB has also clocked 28% over the past week. Earlier this year in January 2024, the ARB price touched an all-time high of $2.4.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Analysis: Why Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t seeing global price spikes after May approval - Nairametrics",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) recently approved the much-anticipated spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\nThe development was celebrated by the crypto industry as it is generally accepted to be a positive development for the crypto market and the industry in all. But despite the approval, the price of Ethereum in the market has remained unchanged with that of Bitcoin even dropping further.\n\nThere are two major reasons for the lack of market activity in response to the just approved spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe reasons why the much-anticipated Ethereum ETF approval has so far had little impact on the prices of crypto assets are:\n\nEarly buyers\n\nThe news about the potential approval of the spot Ethereum ETFs has been on for a while now with the body language of the US regulatory body showing signs of a positive outcome.\n\nEric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg, updated his possibility meter for a spot Ethereum ETF approval from 25% to 75%.\n\nThis and other positive predictions from crypto analysts and experts spurred traders who were looking to cash in on the development to buy Ethereum earlier in the week long before the deadline for the SEC approval.\n\nEther\u2019s price surged 29% over the past week as a result of this flurry of activities\n\nThe current news of the much-anticipated approval finally happening is having little effect on the markets because all the actions by traders who wanted to buy the approval have already happened.\n\nS-1 form delay\n\nAnother reason why the current approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has had little impact on the price of Ethereum and other crypto markets is that although the approval has been confirmed, the process is still incomplete and investors cannot currently engage with the ETFs.\n\nWhat was approved recently were the 19b-4s forms issued by the Ethereum ETF issuers and not the S-1 forms.\n\nThe S-1 form is a comprehensive document including details of the firm\u2019s financials and risk profile as well as the securities it intends to offer.\n\nThe S-1 forms are yet to be approved by the SEC and could take weeks or even months.\n\nWhat this means\n\nThis means that trading in Ethereum ETF is yet to begin and that could be the explanation for the lack of market activity.\n\nHowever, some analysts say it might not immediately lead to an upward trend, citing Bitcoin\u2019s cycle to a price surge after its ETF was launched.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price dropped 15% after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading on Jan. 10. According to CoinMarketCap data, it took 30 days for the price to spike 30% to $51,870.\n\nEthereum price has remained in the range of $3800 to $3706 following the approval of its ETFs by the United States SEC. The article above highlighted reasons for that.\n\nNairametrics earlier reported that crypto analyst Andrey Stoychev has predicted that Ethereum\u2019s price could hit $10k if it succeeds in getting the spot Ethereum Exchange approved.\n\nThis would mean Ethereum beating its all-time high of over $4,800. That remains to be seen as Bitcoin did not immediately witness a price surge after its ETFs were approved and Ethereum\u2019s price has remained unchanged since its ETFs were approved last night."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent retracement follows a significant price rally, with ETF approvals seen as bullish.\n\nMarket volatility and trading activity suggest a complex, potentially bullish future for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum [ETH], a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain platform, has shown significant market activity in recent weeks.\n\nAfter a notable rally of approximately 31.5% over two weeks, raising its value to over $3,900, Ethereum has experienced a slight retracement, settling around $3,845.\n\nThis fluctuation comes amidst broader market movements and regulatory developments that may influence the asset\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nCrypto research firm Kaiko has shed light on these developments, particularly focusing on the potential impact of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThis approval is seen as a positive step for Ethereum, despite potential short-term market adjustments.\n\nThe implications of such regulatory advancements extend beyond immediate price effects, potentially shaping Ethereum\u2019s position in the financial markets and influencing investor sentiment significantly.\n\nEthereum: Market reactions\n\nKaiko\u2019s analysis reveals that the introduction of Ethereum ETFs might initially trigger selling pressure due to potential outflows from existing investment vehicles like Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE).\n\nThe firm currently manages over $11 billion in assets.\n\nHistorical data from similar scenarios suggested that such outflows could significantly impact daily trading volumes.\n\nHowever, as witnessed with Bitcoin ETFs, initial outflows were eventually offset by subsequent inflows, indicating a possible stabilization post-ETF launch.\n\nWill Cai, Head of Indices at Kaiko, emphasized the broader implications of the SEC\u2019s decision, noting it as a declaration of Ethereum\u2019s commodity status rather than a security.\n\nThis classification not only affects Ethereum\u2019s trading and custody but also sets a precedent for the regulation of similar tokens in the U.S., likely fostering a more stable regulatory environment.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Kaiko, the market depth of Ethereum on centralized exchanges stood at approximately $226 million at the time of the report \u2013 42% lower than levels before the FTX collapse.\n\nOnly 40% of this is focused on U.S. exchanges, a decrease from about 50% seen in early 2023.\n\nThe research firm noted:\n\n\u201cOverall, even if inflows disappoint in the short term the approval has important implications for ETH as an asset, removing some of the regulatory uncertainty which has weighed on ETH\u2019s performance over the past year.\u201d\n\nVolatility insights\n\nFurther insights from Kaiko highlighted Ethereum\u2019s volatility trends. Notably, Ethereum\u2019s Implied Volatility surged dramatically in late May, indicating heightened market activity and investor interest.\n\nThis was accompanied by an inversion in the volatility structure, where short-term volatility exceeded long-term expectations\u2014a common indicator of market stress or significant trading activity.\n\nIn derivatives markets, Ethereum has shown remarkable dynamics.\n\nThe Funding Rates for Ethereum\u2019s perpetual Futures experienced a sharp increase from their lowest in over a year to a multi-month high within just a few days.\n\nConcurrently, Open Interest in these futures reached a record $11 billion, suggesting robust capital inflows and increased trading activity.\n\nDespite these promising signs, some metrics suggest caution.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at Glassnode\u2019s data indicated a recent decline in the number of new Ethereum addresses, which could signify a slowdown in new participant inflow to the network.\n\nHowever, our look at Ethereum\u2019s daily chart revealed that the asset recently converted a major resistance level into support, potentially setting the stage for further gains and possibly breaching the $4,000 mark."
