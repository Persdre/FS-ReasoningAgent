        "title": "If You Invested $1,000 in Ethereum in 2019, This Is How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This leading digital asset has rewarded early investors in a huge way.\n\nDespite its gut-wrenching volatility, ongoing regulatory uncertainty, and questionable utility, the cryptocurrency market doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. Investors will continue to try to find winners among the wild asset class.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.80%) might make for a smart choice. This blockchain network has seen its price soar historically. If you were smart enough to invest $1,000 in Ethereum five years ago in early 2019, you'd be sitting on a balance of $21,500 today. That translates to a ridiculously large gain of over 2,000%, which crushes the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Ethereum's past, while trying to figure out what investors can expect going forward.\n\nThe second cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin was launched on the heels of the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 as the world's first cryptocurrency. With this invention, people anywhere in the world could send value to someone else without the use of an intermediary. It was truly revolutionary.\n\nBut Ethereum wanted to be much more than this. It was the second cryptocurrency, launching in 2015. The difference compared to Bitcoin was that Ethereum allowed for the creation of smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the parties of a transaction fulfill their requirements. Think of an escrow payment being released to a seller only after a buyer receives property, for example. This innovative feature put Ethereum on the map.\n\nNowadays, there are many other cryptocurrencies that enable smart contract functionality. But Ethereum is still the leader. According to Electric Capital, a venture investment fund, there were 2,400 active monthly full-time developers working on advancing Ethereum's network, far more than any other crypto asset. This bodes well for Ethereum's ability to continue introducing new features that could boost adoption over the long term.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum has already become the most popular cryptocurrency when it comes to decentralized applications (dApps). There are 3,000 different dApps operating on Ethereum. Ethereum's ultimate success will depend on its ability to drive greater use cases, something that it is well positioned to do compared to other cryptocurrencies out there.\n\nWhat the future might hold\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum originally operated with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This meant that so-called miners had to expend computational resources and energy in order to approve transactions and validate the blockchain. But because critics believe this is a waste of electricity, Ethereum made the long-anticipated transition to a proof-of-stake model in late 2022 with the completion of The Merge. This system leaves the approval of transactions to Ethereum owners who have locked up their holdings. It's meant to be significantly more energy efficient.\n\nThe Merge was viewed as a major breakthrough for Ethereum, not only due to its lower energy needs, but because it sets up the cryptocurrency to scale better in the future. The issue with Ethereum is that it can still only process 13 transactions per second, which doesn't even hold a candle to the 65,000 that a massive payments network like Visa can handle. If Ethereum wants to gain greater adoption across the world, it needs to scale better. And The Merge is one step in that process because it can help to reduce transaction fees while speeding up processing times.\n\nEthereum's developers have numerous other technical updates in the pipeline. While this does add a lot of implementation risk, as many things can go wrong that weren't anticipated, it is encouraging for supporters to see the blockchain constantly trying to improve itself.\n\nEthereum currently sits 52% below its all-time high. Bullish investors who have been on the sidelines might want to take a closer look at this cryptocurrency. It's best to start with a tiny position and potentially add more as your knowledge and conviction grow."

        "title": "Understanding the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) - Securities.io",
        "content": "The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is at the heart of the Ethereum network, serving as the foundation for executing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It plays a pivotal role in enabling Ethereum to be more than just a cryptocurrency platform, expanding its capabilities to support a wide range of decentralized services and applications. Below, we take a closer look at the EVM, exploring its architecture, functionality, and significance in the world of blockchain and decentralized computing.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine, often called the \u2018EVM,' is a crucial component of the Ethereum blockchain. It is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. The EVM ensures that all transactions and computations on the Ethereum network are executed consistently across all nodes, guaranteeing consensus and security.\n\nArchitecture of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nThe EVM can be thought of as a decentralized computer that operates on the Ethereum network. Its architecture is designed to provide security, determinism, and consistency in executing code across the network. Here are some key aspects of the EVM's architecture:\n\nStack-based Architecture: The EVM uses a stack-based architecture, where instructions are executed sequentially, with data pushed and popped from the stack. This design choice ensures simplicity, security, and determinism in code execution.\n\nGas System: To prevent infinite loops and resource abuse, the EVM implements a gas system. Each operation in a smart contract consumes a certain amount of gas, which users must pay for when they initiate transactions. This gas system incentivizes efficient code and discourages malicious or resource-intensive operations.\n\nEthereum Bytecode: Smart contracts on the Ethereum network are written in high-level languages such as Solidity or Vyper. These contracts are compiled into Ethereum bytecode, a low-level language that the EVM can understand and execute.\n\nState Trie: The EVM interacts with the Ethereum state, which includes account balances and storage, through a data structure called a Merkle Patricia Trie. This ensures efficient and secure access to account data and storage.\n\nEthereum Yellow Paper: The EVM's specifications are detailed in the Ethereum Yellow Paper, which provides a formal specification of the EVM's operation, helping maintain consistency across different Ethereum client implementations.\n\nWhile this may seem information may seem daunting, what matters is that the described architecture is what allows developers to create innovative DApps that are built on a strong and flexible foundation.\n\nExecution of Smart Contracts and the Significance of EVM\n\nWhen a user initiates a transaction that involves a smart contract, the EVM performs the following steps:\n\nParsing the Transaction: The EVM first parses the transaction to determine its intent and identify the recipient's smart contract. Authenticating the Transaction: The sender's account is authenticated to ensure they have the necessary funds to cover gas costs. Code Execution: The EVM fetches the bytecode of the smart contract, loads it into memory, and starts executing it instruction by instruction. Gas Management: During code execution, gas is consumed for each operation, ensuring that the contract execution doesn't deplete network resources. State Updates: Depending on the contract's logic, state changes, including updating account balances and storage, may occur. Transaction Finalization: After executing the contract, the EVM updates the transaction status, deducts the gas fees, and confirms the transaction as successful or failed.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine's significance lies in its ability to enable decentralized applications and smart contracts to run on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are some key points highlighting its importance:\n\nTuring Completeness: The EVM's design allows for Turing complete smart contracts, which means they can execute any computable function. This versatility enables the development of a wide range of DApps and use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and beyond.\n\nDecentralized Computation: By executing code on a decentralized network, the EVM eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries and provides trustless, censorship-resistant computation.\n\nImmutable Contracts: Once deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts are immutable, ensuring that the contract's code and rules cannot be altered arbitrarily. This provides security and transparency for users.\n\nOpen Development Ecosystem: The EVM's open and permissionless nature fosters a vibrant ecosystem of developers, innovators, and entrepreneurs, driving continuous growth and innovation within the Ethereum community.\n\nOverall, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the backbone of the Ethereum network, enabling the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its architecture, gas system, and deterministic execution ensure the security and reliability of the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM's significance extends far beyond cryptocurrency, empowering a wide array of decentralized services and applications that continue to shape the future of blockchain technology and decentralized computing."

        "content": "The chief investment officer of Ikigai Asset Management thinks that a setup never before seen in the history of crypto will push Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to fresh all-time highs (ATHs).\n\nIn a long thread on the social media platform X, crypto expert Travis Kling says that a confluence of factors is conspiring to fuel Bitcoin\u2019s rally to a new all-time high.\n\n\u201cBTC has essentially a free walk to ATHs.\n\nWe just got spot BTC ETFs, which unlock safe access to BTC for trillions of dollars that haven\u2019t previously had it.\n\nThe halving is a few months away.\n\nThe Fed is likely to cut rates multiple times this year. Stocks are at ATHs and look like they\u2019re heading higher\u2026\n\nWe can argue about the pace to ATHs (1H-24, 2H-24, 1H-25) and we can argue about how far beyond prior ATHs we\u2019ll eventually go this cycle ($75,000, $90,000, $100,000, $120,000, $180,000), but the path to ATH looks incredibly straightforward.\n\nCrypto will have to do very little \u2018work\u2019 to get BTC into the high $60,000s. It will likely just \u2018happen\u2019 because we have ETFs and the Fed is easing. We\u2019ve never had a setup like that before.\u201d\n\nThe halving, which cuts BTC miners\u2019 rewards in half, is expected in April.\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $43,022.\n\nKling says that Ethereum also has the same setup. But instead of the halving, Kling says Ethereum relies on its burn mechanism which destroys a small amount of ETH with every single transaction.\n\nThe Ikigai executive also believes that a spot market ETH is likely to get approved within the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe same setup as above is also essentially in place for ETH, just delayed by three-12 months.\n\nFor the exact same reasons that the SEC was forced to approve spot [BTC] ETFs (lost the Grayscale decision; court ruled that if you have BTC futures and BTC futures ETFs, you have to allow spot BTC ETFs), the SEC is forced to approve ETH ETFs.\n\nWe can argue about the timing of approval \u2013 March? Probably too early. May? Certainly possible but still maybe a bit early. August? Feels about right.\n\nI think it\u2019s quite unlikely we get to a year from now and won\u2019t have a spot ETH ETF.\n\nCombine that with Fed rate cuts and the reflexivity inherent in the ETH burn mechanism, and I think ETH also has a free walk to ATHs, which is up about 100% from here. Again, reasonable minds can disagree about the timing and how far beyond prior ATHs ETH will go this cycle, but it looks like basically a free walk.\n\nWe\u2019ve never had a setup like that before.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,304.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) rose by 3.74% on Friday to signal an increase in buying momentum. This built on the positive bounce from the $22.8 support level, as buyers look to reclaim the $30 price mark.\n\nWith the general crypto market still undecided on a trend direction, traders have adopted short term trading strategies. As such, ETC presents a good opening to embark on a bullish run with decent profit targets.\n\nBollinger Bands Support Bullish Thesis\n\nThe short term outlook for Ethereum Classic\u2019s price chart looked positive when examined with the Bollinger Bands (BB). The lower band at the $23.7 price range acted as a dynamic support over the past 48 hours, allowing ETC to break above the mid-way point of the band.\n\nThis opened up the Bollinger Bands with price expected to trend upwards. Furthermore, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) highlighted the growing bullish momentum, as buyers flipped the RSI positive with a strong push above the neutral 50 level.\n\nETC/USDT on TradingView (4H Timeframe)\n\nWith price currently trading at $25, short to medium term traders can enter a long position with a first target level of $27.6 and a second target level of $31.2. Both levels would return gains of 10% and 25% respectively.\n\nWith the long term outlook also looking bullish as evidenced by multiple bull candle closes on the daily timeframe along with the RSI remaining above the neutral 50, buyers can confidently expect to register gains on ETC in the near term.\n\nEntry & Exit Price Levels\n\nCMP: $25.22\n\nTarget 1: $27.6\n\nTarget 2: $31.2\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not constitute trading, investment, financial, or other types of advice.

        "title": "Top 6 Ethereum Facts: Everything You Need to Know - Global Crypto",
        "content": "Reading Time: 4 minutes\n\nEthereum, or ETH, as it is more commonly called, is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies out there. At $459.16 billion, it is the second biggest crypto by market cap, next only to Bitcoin. It holds 18.4% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. One Ether token is currently valued at $3,520.23. However, there are many more facts to know about Ethereum and its features. In this article, you can also get free Ethereum.\n\n6 Biggest Ethereum Facts\n\n1. It Was a Crowdfunded Project\n\nThe concept of Ethereum as a cryptocurrency came to life in 2013, just four years after the birth of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Ethereum was the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, who was a co-founder of the Bitcoin online news website at the time. However, funding was one big challenge to the Ethereum project at that time.\n\nIt came at a time when crypto and crypto trading were still relatively unknown, and only Bitcoin was in the game. In 2013, the almighty Bitcoin started at just $13, so it would have been tough for a newcomer to convince big investors to fund the project.\n\nThat same year, many companies, particularly start-ups, were turning to crowdfunding as an alternative funding source, and the Ethereum team did the same. Ethereum turned to the masses to fund the project. By the end of the crowdfunding period, which was on June 1, 2018, they had been able to raise $4,100,000,000, which is worth 7.12 million ETH. It became the biggest crowdfunded project ever. No one saw it coming, but they were able to pull it off. In the end, it was a win-win for everyone. Happy investors, happy Ethereum team!\n\n2. Ethereum Has No Limited Availability\n\nTo preserve the currency\u2019s rarity and value, many cryptos usually have a fixed number of coins that will ever be in circulation. Bitcoin, for example, has a maximum supply of 21 million, meaning that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist; no more can be created or mined. Binance Coin (BNB) has a limited supply of 166,801,148, and Solana (SOL) is limited to 488,630,611.\n\nWell, this does not apply to Ethereum. In other words, Ethereum does not have a limited supply. As of August 2022, over 121.97 million ETH were already in circulation, which means it had already passed Bitcoin\u2019s supply limit by 100 million coins. This is good news for anyone seeking to invest in ETH.\n\nOf course, the founders still put some limits on the supply of Ethereum; it\u2019s not exactly unlimited in the full sense. Like Dogecoin, which has a cap of 5 billion DOGE per year, Ethereum has a cap of 18 million ETH per year, which means only 18 million new ETH can be created in a year.\n\nMoreover, the amount of ETH in circulation is also expected to decrease over the years because of the EIP-1559 burn mechanism, which was designed to address congestion.\n\n3. Ethereum Has an Ice Age Feature\n\nEthereum has an Ice Age feature, but it\u2019s not what you think. This feature is not related in any way to the animated movie \u201cIce Age.\u201d It is a little bit more \u201ctechy.\u201d Ethereum\u2019s Ice Age feature is also known as \u201cthe difficulty bomb.\u201d It is a mining adjustment mechanism added to the Ethereum network to help them reach their goals of switching from Proof of Work Ethereum 1.0 to Proof of Stake Ethereum 2.0 by increasing the difficulty of mining new ETH over time. This Ice Age feature was originally added to the Ethereum 1.x blockchain in 2015.\n\nThe rationale for the inclusion of the Ice Age feature is that when Ethereum was first created, its founders initially wanted it to run on the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. They tried to avoid Proof of Work altogether, but the technology was not quite there yet, and they had to settle for Proof of Work until they could sustainably move to Proof of Stake. However, Ethereum does not want to settle with Proof of Work forever, so they added the Ice Age feature to make things difficult for miners.\n\n4. Ethereum Is More Than a Crypto\n\nYes, Ethereum is the second biggest crypto, but the Ethereum network is much more. The network can host Decentralized Applications, or dApps, as they are popularly known. dApps are just like any other applications we use on our computers except for one thing\u2014they run on the Ethereum network. dApps are just software applications that run on a distributed network. They are not hosted on a centralized server but on a peer-to-peer decentralized network.\n\nThe rationale for dApps is that the current way of dealing with app information is a situation where the owners of the apps have access to information about your social life, health, finances, and everything you do on the internet in exchange for providing you with their services or letting you use their apps. These owners can even completely block you from accessing your information and end their services with you. But with dApps, nobody gets to control your information or monopolize it. dApps decentralize control of information to provide internet freedom and do it with Ethereum.\n\n5. Ethereum Is Inspired by Anime\n\nWhile Ethereum has evolved to become a very complex technological invention, it originated in anime. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, was inspired by Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s anime \u201cLaputa: Castle In The Sky,\u201d where one of the anime\u2019s heroes used a magic crystal called \u201cAethereum\u201d to extract energy from the air.\n\nThat\u2019s where the inspiration for the second biggest crypto was born.\n\n6. Ethereum Has Gone to Space\n\nBelieve it or not, Ethereum went into space in 2021. That year, SpaceChain launched the first Ethereum node in space through a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched from NASA\u2018s Kennedy Space Center.\n\nSpaceChain launched its first Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite into space in 2018, claiming that the satellite switch is cheaper than geostationary monitoring.\n\nThey use these satellites as blockchain nodes to store, process, transmit data, and develop applications.\n\nExtending the Ethereum network to space is a way to increase blockchain technology\u2019s decentralization and improve its security and resilience.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum has become one of the most prominent players in the crypto space, not by being average. What we have discussed in this article are only a few of its unique features; there are still more technological advancements that have made Ethereum stand out. But Ethereum is not stopping anytime soon. With Ethereum 2.0 and the help of the Ethereum community, we expect to see more."

        "title": "$500 Million Worth Of ETH Leave Exchanges Last Week - What This Means For ETH - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Ethereum is currently trading at $2,290 and is on a marginal increase of $0.17 in the past week. Although lacking much action and trading around $2,300 for most of the week, on-chain data regarding outflows has revealed the current sentiment among traders. According to data from on-chain analytics company IntoTheBlock, $500 million worth of ETH was withdrawn from centralized exchanges this week, bringing the total outflow in the past month to $1.2 billion.\n\nSurge In Ethereum Outflow From Exchanges\n\nEthereum went on an unforeseen price growth subsequent to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States. Consequently, various on-chain data have revealed a strong bullish sentiment, with the second largest crypto witnessing outflows from exchanges since this period. Outflows were particularly exacerbated last week, per IntoTheBlock, contributing a larger portion of $1.2 billion ETH withdrawn from exchanges in the past month.\n\n$500M in $ETH was withdrawn from CEXs this week, adding to a total of over $1.2B in outflows in the last month pic.twitter.com/e8NFOGtrDV \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 2, 2024\n\nEthereum currently trading at $2,308 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant, 1.622 million ETH were withdrawn from crypto exchanges last week. A similar metric from the analytics platform shows the ETH reserve on exchanges has been on a free fall for the past year. As of the 4th of January, the statistics indicated that the total quantity of Ethereum that was deposited with various cryptocurrency exchanges amounted to 14.69 million. This number, however, has decreased by 397,012 ETH over the past month, bringing it down to 14.296 million ETH at the time of this writing, its lowest level ever.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For ETH Price?\n\nDropping exchange reserves reduces the amount of ETH available for trading, thereby increasing scarcity. The data from both Cryptoquant and IntoTheBlock indicates Ethereum might be gearing up for a price spike fueled by increasing scarcity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is up by 3.21% in a monthly timeframe. However, it is important to note that the crypto has been on a downtrend after reaching a 23-month high of $2,706 on January 12. A larger part of this downside can be attributed to a $1 billion selloff by Celsius Network as part of its plans to repay its creditors. At the same time, the cryptocurrency is facing constant competition from other blockchains, with Solana recently surpassing it in terms of daily trading volume on Decentralized exchanges.\n\nBased on the current price action, it appears like Ethereum has established a support level slightly above $2,280 and is now attempting a strong increase above this price point. According to a crypto analyst, the current configuration is an apparent replica of a price movement in 2021 which led to ETH reaching its current all-time high of $4,878 in the months after.\n\nFeatured image from Adobe Stock, chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Grok AI predicts Ethereum price for the end of 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and a leader in its Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) niche. Up nearly 100% in 2023, ETH investors now turn their eyes to the token\u2019s performance in 2024.\n\nIn particular, Finbold recurred to Grok\u2019s AI for insights on the price of Ethereum for the end of the year. Grok is an artificial intelligence model developed by xAI, a start-up founded by Elon Musk and directly connected to X.\n\nNotably, Grok sets the most likely range for the end of the year between $4,000 and $5,000 per ETH. According to the AI, the maximum Ethereum can reach in 2024 is $6,500, while the minimum is $2,500.\n\nThe artificial intelligence forecast is extremely bullish because ETH currently trades at $2,306 by press time. However, Grok shows inaccuracy because the market is already below the minimum. For context, Finbold prompted the AI with the current prices; thus, it was aware of this information.\n\nGrok AI Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for the end of 2024. Source: Finbold\n\nEthereum (ETH) analysis\n\nInterestingly, Grok provided the following analysis to justify the above forecast:\n\n\u201cOur Ethereum price prediction for the end of 2024 takes into account various factors, such as the successful Shanghai upgrade, the transition to Proof-of-Stake, and the potential for Ethereum ETFs. The Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s growth, as well as the impact of the Dencun Upgrade, are also considered. With a projected minimum price of $2,300, a maximum of $6,500, and an average of $4,000, Ethereum has the potential to experience significant gains in 2024.\u201d \u2014 Grok, by xAI\n\nGrok AI Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for the end of 2024. Source: Finbold\n\nNevertheless, its justification is solid and considers recent or current events possibly impacting Ethereum\u2019s value. It is also notable how Grok fixed the minimum to what ETH is currently trading at. Therefore, a run to the aforementioned average at $4,000 is likely and would result in a 74% yearly price appreciation.\n\nIn a bullish outlook, ETH could see a surge superior to 180% to its maximum. This is an attractive case of a great risk-reward opportunity if Grok is proven right moving forward.\n\nAll in all, investors must play cautiously and do their own research to find the best investment strategy. Institutional investors like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have their eyes on the leading Web3 blockchain, which could fuel its demand. The highest risk is Ethereum being dethroned by capable competitors like Solana (SOL).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.
