        "title": "It\u2019s a Solanaissance: These 5 charts will cure the Ethereum vibecession - Blockworks",
        "content": "Ethereum is out and Solana is in.\n\nEthereum, its mess of layer-2s and neverending scaling roadmap are doomed to be usurped by its younger \u201cmonolithic\u201d rival.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the rabblers on X are saying.\n\nThe sagging ETH-to-BTC ratio surely isn\u2019t helping. Bitcoin has swelled 160% this year, while ETH hasn\u2019t even doubled. Anyone who sold their bitcoin for ether in January would\u2019ve so far lost a quarter of their BTC on that trade.\n\nSolana\u2019s bitcoin ratio is up more than 300%. SOL\u2019s dollar price is now 10 times what it was at the start of the year, although it\u2019s still down almost two-thirds from its record high at the top of the last bull market.\n\nSolana truthers would also point to the network\u2019s cheap fees and engaged community, which have lately inspired a boom in Solana-native NFTs, memecoins and decentralized exchanges. Solana even flipped Ethereum for DEX volume for the first time earlier this month.\n\nProjects are now plotting additional airdrops to incentivize on-chain Solana activity, hinting at far more buzz to come.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Vitalik fans.\n\nAn Ethereum vibecession may have given way to a Solanaissance, but these charts should pick up your spirits.\n\nEthereum\u2019s number has definitely gone up\n\nOne could sift through the minutiae of blockchain tech stacks \u2014 debate the finer points of the appchain thesis and the security concerns surrounding consensus. Or, we could just focus on price.\n\nEther\u2019s earliest recorded price was $3 when it opened trade way back in 2015. ETH now trades for $2,300 \u2014 a 76,000% return over its whole history (not counting the additional gains made on its ICO price).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time returns would completely dwarf ether\u2019s and solana\u2019s. Let\u2019s just pretend they wouldn\u2019t\n\nSolana has done well but not that well, posting a meager 40,000% since its debut in mid-2020, about half ether\u2019s returns.\n\nAnd we all know that markets are always right.\n\nEvery second dollar locked is on Ethereum\n\nCrypto has so many use cases. You can buy other cryptocurrencies with it. You can buy NFTs with it, and maybe some Dallas Mavericks merchandise.\n\nYou can even buy movie tickets or Adidas shoes with crypto \u2014 although you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin to a payment processor who will dump it for fiat on behalf of the merchant.\n\nIf using crypto as actual money doesn\u2019t appeal, you could always lock it up in a blockchain and earn yield on it. Maybe even lend it out to other people who might buy other cryptocurrencies with it.\n\nEven Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum has more TVL than Solana\n\nThere\u2019s about $53 billion in crypto locked up in DeFi protocols, and more than half of that is on Ethereum. Only 2.6% is staked with Solana platforms, equal to about $1.4 billion.\n\nTVL gets a bad rap by those who say it doesn\u2019t properly reflect how people interact with competing blockchains. Ignore them, they\u2019re probably Solana fans.\n\nUsers pay more to use Ethereum (a good thing)\n\nWe get it, there are cheaper blockchains to use than Ethereum. Solana is one of them.\n\nLow fees are great for anyone who wants to wash trade NFTs and memecoins, but they\u2019re not so great if you want people to actually make money by contributing to the network.\n\nEthereum users have paid more than $2.3 billion to use the blockchain this year. Over on Solana, users have forked out less than $20 million \u2014 under 1% of Ethereum fees.\n\nEven ignoring Ethereum, crypto users have paid way more to use Bitcoin and Tron than Solana\n\nGranted, Ethereum fees don\u2019t go directly to validators anymore, they\u2019re instead burned to reduce the supply, which, in a roundabout way, benefits all ETH holders.\n\nSolana, on the other hand, subsidizes the network\u2019s low fees by printing tokens, effectively penalizing all SOL holders with inflation.\n\nActive addresses and where to find them\n\nUntil we all scan our eyeballs with the Worldcoin orb and blend our biometrics with the blockchain, nailing down exactly how many people really use crypto is practically impossible.\n\nAll that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of pretending.\n\nAdding up the cumulative number of active addresses every day this year across 29 different blockchains shows Ethereum, Solana and even Bitcoin aren\u2019t even the most popular chains.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many of these are unique individuals. Whatever, big numbers are good numbers\n\nThe cumulative daily active addresses for Justin Sun\u2019s Tron is almost 600 million. Binance\u2019s BNB Chain has attracted more than three times the active addresses of Solana.\n\nEthereum mainnet\u2019s count is only slightly ahead of Solana\u2019s, but including layer-2s like zkSync Era, Arbitrum and Optimism gives more than 300 million.\n\nEthereum against the world (wide web 2.0)\n\nCrypto market caps are terribly inaccurate. They\u2019re easily gamed, never take lost supplies into account and hardly ever reflect the real liquidity of the underlying token.\n\nThis often results in valuations far higher than what could be realistically extracted from the market itself. Sounds bad, but most of that can be also said of market capitalizations for stocks.\n\nIn any case, if Ethereum was a stock, with which industries would it compete?\n\nSure, comparing crypto to stocks is apples to oranges. It still feels right\n\nEthereum\u2019s whole \u201cworld computer\u201d shtick could force it alongside cloud stocks like Amazon, Cisco and IBM. The network\u2019s power to process stablecoin payments would otherwise put it against PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s market cap, averaged out over the past six months, is three times PayPal\u2019s and seven times more than the stock valuation of Cash App creator Block (formerly Square).\n\nSolana\u2019s current market cap is now above Block\u2019s, but its average since June is lower than all of them.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

But when it comes to looking out for the future of your career, even the busiest of developers should understand how important it is to stay current with the newest developer trends. Blockchains have, quite simply, revolutionized many spaces thanks to the implementation of dApps. But can blockchains stay at the forefront of revolutionizing technology if it becomes stagnant? Blockchain primitives will have a huge impact on the ever-changing development of distributed ledger technology, and it will all boil down to one thing: protocols.\n\nPublic blockchains involve active participants (miners, validators, node operators etc.) to contribute towards the common goal of strengthening the network and confirming transactions through some sort of distributed consensus algorithm.\n\nWith the rising popularity of cryptocurrency, the rise of a new generation of crypto-lovers has also fueled the growth of a new beast: non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe way the world interacts with visual art is changing.

When I started developing Solidity smart contracts and Ethereum dapps in 2017, Truffle and Web3.js were the industry standard. These are great tools and I have tons of respect for the people that built them. However, anyone who has used them has dealt with bugs and sometimes poor developer experience. There are a few new tools out there that have clearly been inspired by these first sets of tools and made the developer process much better.\n\nI hope you enjoyed your bear market baptism.\n\nThe world witnessed some of the massive DeFi hacks in 2021 on some of the most renowned protocols like bZx, Cheese Bank, Harvest Finance, Value Defi, etc.\n\nRandom numbers in Solidity for Ethereum using the Niguez Randomity Engine\n\nThis article will guide you through running ETH2.0 Beacon Node with Lighthouse client on MacOS if you have barely to 0 experiences with Terminal command lines and you want to spin off Lighthouse Beacon node and join the validator pool on ETH2.0 Beacon chain with Lighthouse client.

Guess, what? Each of them claims to be the \u201cnext-big-thing\u201d, still they are just a broken iteration of one other.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language. It allows anyone to create a decentralised application, by making use of Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nThe mother of DeFi is Etheurem, but the true DeFi platform the world needs now is Bitcoin-based, which follows the original idea of Satoshi Nakomoto.\n\nIn this post we'll look at 10 affordable NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\ntldr; Below is a hefty and yet still somehow high-level overview of Ethereum. The roughly 5-year-old project has emerged as one of the most exciting and proven projects in the cryptocurrency space while somehow still encompassing the most risk and arguably, upside of any crypto-project. This dichotomy has allowed Ethereum to act as a sort of magic mirror for those in the industry. Fanboys and detractors alike can look into the project and see what they want to see: the 2nd-most successful crypto-project with product-market fit and an army of developers behind it or a nascent, experimental Frankenstein so complicated it would make Rube Goldberg blush.\n\nImage Credit: UnsplashThe endless possibilities of cryptocurrencies have seen a lot of businesses show interest in the token economy and the overall blockchain space.\n\nMost of the applications on Ethereum are micro-financial ones where the price per ticket ranges from $100 \u2014 $1000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) supply is becoming scarce while demand is rising. Here's what you need to know.\n\nHow the Internet Computer promises to serve as a decentralized, scalable layer for Web3 and blockchain-based gaming.\n\nThe future is now, it's 2020 and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are experiencing a Cambrian explosion.\n\nTypically in an enterprise, you have top-down hierarchies as the mechanism of control. Let's look at a quick example of how a DAO works differently in action.\n\nImagine you\u2019re building a startup, except at this startup, there is a clear sense of organization without humans organizing other humans. It all runs organically, and it's generative in nature, meaning it evolves, innovates and experiences high growth from within.\n\nLeaderless leadership!\n\nHow is such a way of working together achieved?\n\nThrough active participation from interested parties who share common values, missions and objectives. People-driven autonomous organizations happen mostly through voting on decisions that are proposed by other community members.\n\nYou can propose, vote and discuss decisions as a team without having to have a singular authority to report to. Resulting in new ideas being seeded and proposed from within the organization to solve mission-critical challenges that the DAO is facing.\n\nIt's really a synthesis of innovation and ambition, it's great!\n\nWith that said there are certainly some balanced benefits and drawbacks about this model that we should explore.\n\nFor the moment DAOs function in a fairly binary nature, you vote on proposals that you or others have submitted, typically these votes take place on blockchains by signing a transaction with your crypto wallet. That means the current state of DAOs is experiencing the highest growth in the blockchain industry. So whilst DAOs are now, they might be somewhat gravitating around the future of money.\n\nHowever crypto-centric it is right now, it is definitely laying out an exceptional framework that any organization type could be built upon. We are seeing many other non-crypto DAOs emerge too, using platforms like Aragon to create a DAO in minutes on the blockchain. This is achieved by creating a Governance Token on the Ethereum blockchain. When users hold these Governance Tokens they can vote on proposals put forward to the community.\n\nThese communities can even have treasuries where the DAO can organize their finances. For example, members that hold these Governance Tokens can suggest making a payment, creating a vote inside the community so it can be approved or denied collectively.\n\nThere are many lessons to learn about how to coordinate large groups of self-interested people.\n\nI recently wrote an article, \"Failure shows us the way\", where I outlined my thesis on how I think we can even coordinate groups who don't explicitly share the same values, they instead just share the same mission. It's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds with the DAOs that are experimenting right now.\n\nWhy are DAOs exploding right now?\n\nBasically there is an entire unstoppable movement happening because of projects offering up a Governance Token as a bonus to those who are using some Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nI've heard many stories from folks achieving incredible results in less than 5 days. For example, \"With YFI I earned like $3.5k on $24k\", one community member shared with me.\n\nThat example is a 14.58% increase in capital in just five days, no wonder it's getting attention.\n\nWait, how are people making money from these Governance Tokens?\n\nIn the DeFi world, there is a new meme known as Yield Farming \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf3e its technical name is Liquidity Mining.\n\nThis is where a user deposits crypto stablecoins like USDC, DAI & USDT to earn a reasonably safe and secure return, which lately seems to be roughly 8% APY. As well as this, these DeFi applications which have newly formed their own DAOs to oversee their protocols, are rewarding users with Governance Tokens when they have funds deposited into their various DeFi products.\n\nThis has added rocket fuel to the DeFi community, with an explosive $3 Billion USD flowing into projects in just the last couple of weeks. This doesn't stop here either, there are many more DAO innovations that will be made known during this wave of Governance Tokens. One example is Referral Yield Farming, where you can earn Governance Tokens for referring people to DeFi platforms without having to deposit any funds of your own.\n\nArt101 announced a Vitalik Buterin NFT collection 'Based Vitalik'\n\nThere is no doubt that the crypto space is growing at a very rapid pace, but no one can ignore the scams that are prevalent in this ecosystem. If we just go back a few years, more than 80 percent of the ICOs were identified as outright scams in a study conducted by the ICO advisory firm Statis Group.\n\nWhile Vitalik Buterin is the most well-known name in the Ethereum space, the birth of Ethereum was a collaborative effort, as were later developments like ERC-20. Fabian Vogelsteller is one-such early Ethereum developer and thought leader on blockchain technology. He has built many Ethereum user and developer-facing projects including the Ethereum Mist browser, the Ethereum Wallet and web3.js - the Ethereum\u2019s space most used JavaScript library.\n\nTogether with Vitalik Buterin, he proposed the ERC20 token standard, which initiated the world ICO wave and redefined investment and crowd ownership as we know it. Today Fabian is leading the concept, design, and development of the LUKSO Blockchain.\n\nPolkadot is a radically different approach to blockchain scaling. But have solutions like Binance Smart Chain already made it unnecessary?\n\nDue to a clogged network, Ethereum just got an expansion \u2014 but at what cost? Here's everything you need to know about the ethereum gas limit debate.\n\nThe other day I got myself in a situation where I needed to communicate with the Ethereum network using python in an environment where getting web3.py to work seemed pretty much impossible. Since I still needed to talk to the network, I resorted to using the JSON-RPC API provided by Ethereum, which all web3 libraries are built on top of. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty interesting! So, let\u2019s get started!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community for a while, then you\u2019ve surely heard the phrase \u201cwe just need a killer app\u201d to get crypto into the mainstream. Now, as you\u2019ve most likely also noticed, many of the current decentralized applications that are out there have great ideas backing them \u2014 perhaps even revolutionary ones \u2014 so why aren\u2019t any of these dApps achieving widespread use? Why aren\u2019t they, or one of them, the \u201ckiller app\u201d that we need? I certainly don\u2019t think the gambling dApps topping the daily usage tracking charts would constitute such an app.\n\nCompanies can determine whether they should invest in blockchain by focusing on specific use cases and their market position.\n\n\u201cI need a no-code platform to build my own web3 product!\u201d Is that you? If so, discover the right tool for the job from creators of a no-code web3 platform.\n\nBlockchain is a part of a trustless digital solution.\n\nBlockchains depend heavily on network effects, i.e. the notion that networks such as telecommunication services, the Internet, or social networks become more valuable when their number of users grows. This is why ecosystem building is one of the main factors that drives the value of a Layer 1 blockchain enterprise. Here is a comparison of how different blockchain projects handle this.\n\nzkEVM is said to be the crown jewel of Ethereum scaling schemes.

Despite being a gateway into the world of decentralized finance, centralized exchanges are very\u2026well\u2026centralized in nature and hide many of its intrinsic mechanics from the scrutiny of public blockchains. Not surprisingly, ten years after the creation of Bitcoin, the internal architecture of centralized exchanges remains a mystery to even the top experts in the crypto market.\n\nPhoto by Cl\u00e1udio Luiz Castro on Unsplash\n\nCentralized exchanges are, arguably, one of the most challenging components to analyze in the crypto-asset markets. While the behavior of many actors in the crypto space is transparently recorded in distributed ledgers, centralized exchanges still operate largely off-chain only publishing subset of the activity to the corresponding blockchains. Without a doubt, centralized exchanges introduce a level of opacity that challenges even the most sophisticated analytic techniques. And yet, the analysis of the behavior of centralized exchanges can yield many interesting benefits for crypto investors and traders. Imagine that you are able to effectively track large crypto transfers between exchanges that can anticipate a large position on a specific crypto asset. All that, however, requires understanding the underlying patterns in centralized exchanges.\n\nThe global healthcare crisis caused by COVID-19 has severely impacted the financial markets. From stocks to commodities, industries are in disarray.\n\nCryptographically, the brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all.\n\nThis article is about a Web3 company called YellowCard that has a crypto exchange app platform for bitcoin, ethereum and others, based for the African market.\n\nIn this interview, we discuss Grim Reaper's crypto story, the reason for his anonymity, crypto mining, EIP 1559, and more.\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed a dramatic slowdown in the Ethereum network, you\u2019re not alone. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s happening \u2013 and why it\u2019s about to get a whole lot worse.\n\nSometimes the EOS platform is advertised as an ecosystem that doesn't require any fees for making transactions. Technically, it is true. However, if you try to make an EOS transaction you will eventually find out that you need to put some of your EOS coins on hold.\n\nDecentralized fundraising and the ability to raise money \u201cindependently\u201d from VCs and funds has always been a deeply rooted ideal in the crypto sphere.\n\nDeFi or decentralized finance is a growing sector in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space that defines an ecosystem of decentralized applications providing financial services with no governing authority.\n\nIt\u2019s time to make a DAO! Anyone can make their own DAO with Aragon or DAOstack, or just by forking Molloch. Even better, you can use an augmented bonding curve to fund your DAO, thanks to the amazing work by the Commons Stack folks, and there you have it! A fully-functioning DAO with just a few days of work!\n\nAfter the global economic crisis of 2008, the question of trust in the modern international financial system arose globally. The answer to this request was the emergence of the first decentralized Internet system \u2014 Bitcoin, which from \u201cdecentralized\u201d money turned into a valuable financial asset by 2020.\n\nI guess the first question is, Why? Why should an internet community become a DAO?\n\nAll but the simplest of Ethereum applications are composed of several smart contracts. This is because of a hard limit of 24KB in any deployed contract, and because your sanity will slip away as the complexity of a smart contract grows.\n\nCentralized crypto exchanges are the most important black box of the crypto ecosystem. We all use them, we have a love-hate relationship with them, and we understand very little about their internal behavior. At IntoTheBlock, we have been heads down working on a series of machine learning models that help us better understand the internal of crypto exchanges. Recently, we presented some of our initial findings at a highly oversubscribed webinar and I thought it would be elaborate further in some of the ideas discussed there.\n\nThe following are not my beliefs, but a compilation of notes from conversations I had with a self-described Bitcoin \u201cmutant\u201d, named Edan Yago, contributor to Sovryn. Letting him ramble on about Bitcoin resulted in mesmerizing, mythical, and fascinating ruminations about Bitcoin\u2019s destiny. So for one, I myself believe in Bitcoin as a digital store of value. It is a huge chunk of my portfolio, and I believe it will outlast 99% of the cryptocurrencies we have today. There is no better symbol of scarcity and hard money in crypto to date. However, I feel just about the same level of admiration for Ethereum, as it is opening up so many use cases through DeFi and DAOs. I am putting my biases aside to explain a very rare (and what I find fascinating) point of view. I present you Part 1 of The Hero\u2019s Journey of Bitcoin:\n\nFirst things first, it\u2019s called Vyper, not Viper.\n\nThe go-to blockchain for decentralized finance is still Ethereum (ETH). It has the great advantage of being a first mover, so plenty of investors are already aware of ETH and its use cases. ETH tokens also played a role in the tokensale bonanza of 2017 and 2018, and are now becoming highly active again in their new role as the backbone of the DeFi market.\n\nAbout the writer\n\nMoney is a social tool to achieve cooperation among a group of people.

Ethereum was designed with a broader vision, as adecentralized or world computer that attempts to marry the power of the blockchain, as a trust machine, with a Turing-complete contract engine. Although Ethereum borrows many ideas that were initially introduced by bitcoin, there are many divergences between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum virtual machine and smart contracts are key elements of Ethereum, and constitute its main attraction. In Ethereum, smart contracts represent a piece of code written in a high-level language(Solidity, LLL, Viper) and stored as bytecode in the blockchain, in order to run reliably in a stack-based virtual machine (Ethereum Virtual Machine), in each node, once invoked. The interactions with smart contract functions happen through transactions on the blockchain network, with their payloads being executed in the Ethereum virtual machine, and the shared blockchain state being updated accordingly.\n\nblockchains offer the simplest means of keeping self-audited immutable records without having to use any third party service.\n\nMany of us have come to know about decentralized finance (DeFi) and have faced this sector with many doubts, understanding its potential, especially given the interests and the APR and APY it provides to those who interact with the various protocols.\n\nThe #creatoreconomy is changing quickly with the influence of #NFT #Crypto and #blockchain.\n\nThe two latest thrilling things in the Ethereum ecosystem are NFT and DeFi. Until 2020, these \"Money LEGOs\" were quite isolated from each other but became the arena of many new projects, innovations, and volume records. And I'm sure that there's more room to grow and blend.\n\nNowadays, binary options trading has transformed into one of the most popular financial products of the Internet era.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s first and dominant smart contract platform, has the largest dapp ecosystem with more than a million deployed smart contracts and hundreds of millions of dollars in monthly transactions\n\nThree example configurations for the new OpenZeppelin access control contract.\n\nEthereum's native crypto asset Ether will increase from $3,077 to $32,468 in the next five years, representing a 10.6x ROI.\n\nDemystifying the EVM Through Interactive Puzzles - A Walkthrough.\n\nThe State of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Job Market in 2019-2020\n\nBuilding a custom authentication flow using Amazon Cognito and MetaMask\n\nSupply elasticity is a property of money that allows the supply to expand and contract on an as-needed basis in order to meet demand. Well established monies like gold, as well as modern age cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, do not have this property.\n\nThe whole fintech industry is built around the interactions of various institutions. Fintech products can be as advanced and complex as you want them to be; they can solve essential problems for their customers, but in the end, the focal point is always some bank happily sitting on money. Thus, centralized finances are the banks and their subsidiaries. Many things in fintech are controlled by bureaucrats and most fintech apps function only because they are allowed to.\n\nThank you for checking out the 271 most read stories about Ethereum on HackerNoon.\n\nVisit the /Learn Repo to find the most read stories about any technology."

        "content": "Crypto ETF approvals could attract a portion of the $5.6 trillion US pension market to crypto.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum will unlock \u201cthe universe of the pensions, insurers, etc,\u201d says Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn an interview with FOX Business, McDermott discussed the future impact of spot ETF approval on institutional adoption and commercial opportunities within the digital asset sector.\n\nAccording to McDermott, spot crypto ETFs will create \u201cinstitutional products that can be traded by institutions that don\u2019t need to touch the base assets.\u201d This will enhance liquidity and attract more pension funds, insurance firms, and other institutional investors to crypto.\n\nWith the US pension market now over $5.6 trillion, it\u2019s easy to see why McDermott envisions spot crypto ETFs attracting institutional capital. The approval of such products would enable more institutional participation in the digital asset space.\n\nMcDermott noted that while spot crypto ETFs may have a gradual impact rather than an immediate spike, he expects to see \u201ca broadening and a deepening of liquidity and those looking to trade the product\u201d in 2023.\n\nThe Growth Potential in Digital Assets\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, McDermott believes the blockchain industry will continue expanding due to increasing real-world adoption and supportive regulations. Over the past year, clearer policies and frameworks have already driven more institutional involvement in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs announced the launch of its tokenization platform, GS DAP, to streamline the issuance, management, and trading of tokenized assets across various asset classes.\n\nIn 2020, Matthew McDermott joined Goldman as head of digital assets. Known for his visionary approach to financial markets, he believes blockchain technology is key to revitalizing and empowering the financial system."

In an extensive post on the X platform, Sun highlighted Buterin\u2019s pivotal role in Ethereum\u2019s early development and drew parallels between their journeys.\n\nI have known @VitalikButerin for eight years now.\n\nVitalik is younger than me, but his insights far exceed mine. I have always been able to learn from Vitalik.\n\nAlthough in the Crypto world, many people may see us as representatives of different values in the crypto world, as if we\u2026 \u2014 H.E. Justin Sun \u5b59\u5b87\u6668 (@justinsuntron) December 29, 2023\n\nJustin Sun disclosed that his acquaintance with Buterin traces back to 2015, during his initiation into Jack Ma\u2019s Hupan University, marking his entry into the crypto realm. Engaging with Buterin during Ethereum\u2019s nascent stage, Sun revealed purchasing a substantial amount of Ethereum, yet faced the challenge of needing an active wallet to house the acquired assets. Proposing the necessity of a decentralized wallet, Sun presented multiple prototypes to Buterin.\n\nDespite diverging paths over nearly a decade, Justin Sun emphasized shared foundational principles with Buterin, particularly on decentralization. Stressing the importance of protocols functioning seamlessly even in the absence of their founders, Sun underscored their aligned ideologies.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s Impact On Tron and Crypto Platforms\n\nJustin Sun delved deeper into the importance of \u201cauditability,\u201d emphasizing the critical need for accessibility in verifying application logic. His advocacy extended to ensuring continuous full-node operation, a crucial element in guaranteeing compliance with the instructions outlined in open-source documentation. These foundational beliefs echo across fundamental blockchain concepts, embracing ideals such as open global participation and neutrality principles.\n\nRenowned as a pivotal figure within the crypto landscape, Sun\u2019s influence extends across multiple industry-leading applications. He holds sway over significant platforms like Tron Blockchain, the BitTorrent protocol, Poloniex Exchange, and Huobi Global. Sun\u2019s transactional activities stand under the scrutiny of meticulous tracking by top-tier market analysts, underscoring his substantial impact and reach within the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nJustin Sun has been criticized, particularly after the Poloniex exchange hack. Nevertheless, his steadfast conviction in the future of blockchain technology and his unwavering commitment to preserving the fundamental principles of decentralization remains steadfast.\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s tribute to Vitalik Buterin underscores their intertwined past and sheds light on their shared vision for blockchain\u2019s future. As the industry evolves, their ideological alignment might continue to shape the trajectory of decentralized technologies."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, an Ethereum whale has recently made a huge purchase of 25,674 ETH; however, this action could backfire if the price of ETH falls below a specific threshold, triggering a liquidation event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom all indications, it appears that the whale obtained the said ETH from MakerDAO. This decentralized lending platform allows users to mint stablecoins (DAI) by locking up their crypto assets as collateral.\n\nWhen the price of $ETH drops to $2,257, the smart money will be in danger of liquidation.\n\n\n\nThe healthy ratio on #Maker is as low as 1.03.\n\n\n\nThe smart money once again spent 61M $DAI to buy 25,674 $ETH, and then sold 5,851 $ETH for 14M $DAI, making ~$99K.https://t.co/yGkFI6qpnj pic.twitter.com/VRmstUCngE \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 29, 2023\n\nLookonchain reports that the whale had spent 61 million DAI to buy 25,674 ETH; however, the whale shortly after sold 5,851 ETH out of this stash for a value of 14 million DAI, of which they made a profit of $99,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the whale had made some profits from this strategy, they also faced the risk of liquidation. If the ETH price goes below a certain level, the whale's collateral will be insufficient to cover their debt, and MakerDAO will automatically liquidate the ETH to reclaim the DAI.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, if the price of ETH drops to $2,257, the said large ETH holder might be in danger of liquidation. This is because the healthy ratio on MakerDAO is presently as low as 1.03.\n\nThe Ethereum price is nearing this threshold, having fallen 3.56% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,280, according to CoinMarketCap data. Since reaching a high of $2,448 on Dec. 28, the price of Ethereum has steadily dropped.\n\nIf today closes in red, ETH might be set to mark its third consecutive day of losses. The ETH price fell to intraday lows of $2,255 on Dec. 29, but at present, it has held up above the lows of $2,267 marked in today's trading session.\n\nWherever ETH price trends, the whale's fate is now related to the performance of ETH and the crypto market as a whole, which is currently declining as investors book profits through the end of 2023."

        "title": "The Year Of Ethereum: ETH Long-Term Holder Percentage Surpasses BTC - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "The percentage of long-term ETH holders has skyrocketed this year to surpass Bitcoin for the second time ever. According to data from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Ethereum has done pretty well in its percentage of long-term holders this year, with over 70% of investors currently holding on to their assets for more than a year, a new milestone for the blockchain.\n\nETH Long-Term Holders Now Top BTC\n\nEthereum\u2019s price activity has largely underperformed this year when compared to Bitcoin. But this isn\u2019t surprising, as Bitcoin has led the entire industry in bullish metrics and investor confidence this year. However, data from IntoTheBlock suggest more Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH for the long haul, hopefully with the belief that it will continue to rise substantially in value over time.\n\nLong-term holders are investors who refuse to sell their crypto even during times of market volatility and price depreciation. They are particularly important in maintaining the overall health of any blockchain, as they help to provide stability and reduce price volatility.\n\nHistory has shown Ethereum surpassing Bitcoin as regards this metric only once before. It\u2019s important to note that the last time this happened, ETH would go on to lead in this metric over the subsequent months.\n\n2023 Review! This year, the percent of long-term $ETH holders surpassed that of Bitcoin for the second time ever! pic.twitter.com/i6kDzAjzgM \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 30, 2023\n\nOn the other hand, In/Out of the Money metric by IntoTheBlock shows Bitcoin leading Ethereum in terms of profitability. At the time of writing, 82.25% of all BTC addresses are making money at the current price, compared to 76.10% of ETH addresses.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s high profitability can be linked to a huge number of early Bitcoins assumed to be lost forever. As a result, the percentage of holders who bought at the current price metric puts Ethereum ahead of Bitcoin.\n\nTotal crypto market cap is currently at $1.6 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAround 63% of ETH addresses who bought around the current price of $1,948 and $2,641 are still in profit compared to BTC\u2019s 52% of addresses that bought between $35,729 and $48,402.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $2,285 and is up by 91% this year. However, the asset\u2019s price has largely underperformed in comparison to major altcoins like Solana and Cardano, who are currently up by 925% and 145% respectively this year.\n\nInterestingly, this hasn\u2019t stopped bullish predictions from coming in regarding Ethereum. One of these is a prediction from BitMex founder Arthur Hayes, who estimated an astounding $5,000 price for Ethereum. Crypto analyst Raoul Pau also looked at price history to predict ETH outperforming BTC becoming a key macro trend of 2024. The first step in achieving this would be to break above the $2,380 price level.\n\nFor all the ETH bears\u2026 in Feb 2021, BTC first hit $44,000 (where it is today) and ETH was at $1400 (now $2250), 9 months later ETH was up 245%, BTC was up 45%\u2026 I think ETH outperforming BTC will be a key macro trend of 2024 and our work at EXPAAM suggests it. 1/ pic.twitter.com/QGSZahhldg \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 21, 2023\n\nFeatured image from Pexels"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s price teeters: What about its bullish prediction? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH may fall to $2,215 as large sell-off spreads.\n\nTraders are confident that the altcoin will recover in no time.\n\nAccording to Whale Alert, a whale sent 14,610 Ethereum [ETH] tokens to the Coinbase exchange on the 30th of December. The transaction was the second one within 12 hours after an initial transfer involving 9,991 ETH.\n\nAs of this writing, the value of the transaction was worth $33.50 million. The move is a sign that the altcoin might be at risk of selling pressure.\n\nIf the cryptocurrency keeps experiencing a high inflow into exchanges, then the price could drop from $2,220.\n\nInterestingly, the last week of 2023 has given the ETH a turnaround. On the 28th of December, the value of ETH hit $2,415 as AMBCrypto reported.\n\nThis increase gave the Ethereum community a glimmer of hope that the ETH price season to shine was close.\n\nNo backing down on the potential\n\nHowever, the past few days indicated that ETH holders might need to wait a little longer for an extended rally. But what do traders think of the price action?\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed ETH\u2019s funding rate via the crypto analysis tool Santiment.\n\nFunding rates show if long are paying a funding fee to shorts. It also indicates if it\u2019s the other way around. If the Funding Rate is positive, then most traders are bullish. Also, a negative Funding Rate suggests more short positions than longs.\n\nAt press time, ETH\u2019s Funding Rate was 0.031%. This reading suggested that traders were bullish on the price at press time.\n\nAnother metric to consider in assessing market perception toward ETH is the Weighted Sentiment. From the chart above, the Weighted Sentiment had dropped from 2.47 to 0.48.\n\nThe decline suggested the broader market was being careful in betting on the Ethereum native cryptocurrency.\n\nETH eyes another downturn\n\nRegarding the Open Interest, Coinglass showed that the indicator had risen to $8.40 billion. Open Interest measures market sentiment and strength behind price trends.\n\nSo, the increase means that money was flowing into contracts related to ETH. However, it could also be a sign of strength for the downward trend ETH\u2019s price was going through.\n\nFrom the ETH/USD 4-hour chart, the altcoin had felt the impact of the sell-offs as the price decreased to $2,290. A look at the Awesome Oscillator (AO) also showed that the momentum around the coin was bearish.\n\nAt the time of writing, the AO was -10.45.\n\nShould the indicator remain that way, then ETH\u2019s price might plunge further. Another indicator to consider was the Fibonacci Retracement. At press time, the 0.786 Fib Retracement level was at $2,215.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThis position indicated that ETH might drop to the region as long as selling pressure remained.\n\nHowever, $2,215 could be a good entry. This is because ETH has the potential to rebound, since the price was a previous support level for the altcoin."

After years of development, the gigantic Ethereum upgrade known as the Merge has finally happened, switching the digital machinery at the core of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value to a considerably more energy-efficient system.\n\nHuge changes for Ethereum are on the horizon. We have Eth2, EIP 1559, and Layer 2 scaling. Here, we explore how they influence ETH tokenomics and price.\n\nVery little has changed the last couple of decades when it comes to real estate practices. Buying and selling a home today is much like what it was fifty years ago. It's more or less the same process as when our grandparents' generations purchased and sold homes.\n\nNothing in this document constitutes financial advice.\n\nSetting up your dev environment for Ethereum development takes just a few minutes. It\u2019s important to have a basic understanding of a few general concepts before we start writing code.\n\nNFT collections are bundles of unique digital objects founded on a single principle and have become enormously popular in the crypto market of late. The variety of blockchains that NFT collections have been launched on in 2022 has noticeably increased, but Ethereum remains the most popular by far.\n\nTapping into Ethereum Grandpa's Curious Consciousness with Dmitry Buterin\n\nThe problem in accessing of Ethereum blockchain, the 'gatekeepers' to writing on the blockchain, the ultimate solution and allowing (no OS) device access\n\nTLDR: Eternal Storage provides the stable and flexible base needed to build and maintain long-lived decentralized applications.\n\ntldr; Below is a hefty and yet still somehow high-level overview of Ethereum. The roughly 5-year-old project has emerged as one of the most exciting and proven projects in the cryptocurrency space while somehow still encompassing the most risk and arguably, upside of any crypto-project. This dichotomy has allowed Ethereum to act as a sort of magic mirror for those in the industry. Fanboys and detractors alike can look into the project and see what they want to see: the 2nd-most successful crypto-project with product-market fit and an army of developers behind it or a nascent, experimental Frankenstein so complicated it would make Rube Goldberg blush.\n\nThank you for checking out the 95 most read stories about Ethereum Top Story on HackerNoon.\n\nVisit the /Learn Repo to find the most read stories about any technology."

These updates are part of Ethereum's ongoing effort to bolster network security and optimize its protocol for a more efficient system.\n\nCombating centralization in PoS\n\nIn the realm of PoS, centralization can create vulnerabilities and unfair advantages, an issue Buterin is tackling head-on.\n\nThe updated \"The Scourge\" phase targets MEV, which refers to the maximum value that miners can extract from block production beyond the standard block rewards and gas fees. This practice can lead to centralization as it favors larger players with more resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButerin's strategy involves exploring new MEV mechanics and distributing blocks to mitigate these risks. Additionally, the road map addresses stake pooling issues by considering revised staking economics and validator experience improvements, which could lead to a more decentralized and secure network.\n\nInnovations in data storage and efficiency\n\nProgress in the \"The Verge\" phase signifies a significant step toward integrating Verkle trees, a data structure that promises to optimize storage and increase transaction efficiency on the Ethereum network. This move aligns with the broader goal of scalability and performance enhancement.\n\nFurthermore, the plan reflects a community consensus to deprioritize \"state expiry,\" recognizing the potential of stateless clients and other innovations to manage blockchain state more effectively.\n\nThese developments represent a deliberate and methodical approach to Ethereum's evolution, with an emphasis on timely and incremental improvements rather than waiting for large-scale overhauls."

        "content": "Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has shared the crypto project\u2019s roadmap for 2024. In a series of posts on X on December 30, Buterin spoke extensively on Ethereum\u2019s gameplan for the new year, which he claims is quite similar to the plan for 2023, albeit with a few changes.\n\nEthereum Roadmap 2024\n\nAccording to information revealed by Buterin, the main focus of Ethereum for 2024 centers around six key goals, namely the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nThe Ethereum Merge aims to create an ideal, simple, robust, and decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) network.\n\nThe Merge occurred in September 2022 with the integration of the Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, thus marking the end of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Speaking on post-Merge improvements in 2024, Buterin claimed that the single-slot finality (SSF) mechanism presented the easiest method of eliminating the current restrictions of Ethereum\u2019s PoS design.\n\n\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nIn regards to the Surge, Buterin stated that there will be notable advancements in rollup scaling with significant developments both on EIP 4844 and within various rollups. Additionally, there will be a focus on long-term improvement in cross-rollup standards and interoperability, all of which will drive Ethereum toward achieving the goal of processing over 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder also highlighted that the Scourge target has been re-oriented to tackling economic centralization in two key areas namely MEV and liquid staking/pooling. In addition, Buterin stated that there will be significant progress in achieving the Verge with the incoming introduction of verkle trees, which will contribute to the easy verification of blocks in the Ethereum network.\n\nButerin Faces Allegations From Former Ethereum Foundation Advisor\n\nIn other news, Buterin has been accused of \u201cdefrauding the world\u201d by former Ethereum Foundation adviser Steven Nerayoff. This statement came in response to Buterin\u2019s concerns about the perversion of the original vision of Web 3.\n\nIn a blog post on Dec 28, the Ethereum founder shared that the blockchain project was initially designed to function as a decentralized, shared hard drive. However, users have since diverted from the vision with a focus more on the financial applications of Ethereum.\n\nNerayoff countered Buterin\u2019s claims, stating that the Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, along with \u201chis cabal,\u201d are responsible for the perversion of the \u201cWeb 3 vision,\u201d which they used to \u201cdefraud the world.\u201d So far, there has been no response to these accusations.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,285.41 with a 0.81 decline in the last day. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s daily trading volume is down by 36.68% and valued at $6.84 billion.\n\nETH trading at $2,285.41 on the daily chart | Source: ETHUSDT chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview"

Take the record 19 billionaires \u2014 7 more than last year \u2014 who made a fortune after investing in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat links Elon Musk, the Winklevoss Twins \u2014 owner of crypto exchange Gemini \u2014 and Michael Saylor? They\u2019re all connected to some cryptocurrency. While Musk and Tesla are, more often than not, tied to Dogecoin and Bitcoin, respectively, the other two names have significant Bitcoin holdings.\n\nLargest ETH Holder Owns 29% of All Ethereum Tokens In Circulation\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, it\u2019s a different story altogether. Even the largest holders of ETH are often out of the limelight. However, data from Etherscan revealed that crypto exchanges were the largest holders of ETH in 2023, which shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, given ETH\u2019s availability on every exchange.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers. Remember, these are only ballpark estimates.\n\n\n\nThe Beacon Chain Contract holds more than 35 million ETH, controlling over 29% of all ETH tokens in circulation, making it the largest ETH holder as of Dec 28, 2023. Coming in second place is Wrapped ETH (WETH) with more than 3.2 million ETH, worth around $7.7 billion.\n\nBinance has significant ETH Holdings\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, is the third-largest single address for ETH, holding more than nearly 2 million ETH. Kraken, which was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month for deceptive practices, grabbed the fourth spot, with ETH holdings of roughly 1.6 million.\n\nPopular trading platform, Robinhood is fifth on the list. At the time of writing, it had more than 1.4 million ETH under its belly, which loosely translates to about 1.24% of all ETH tokens in circulation.\n\nNotably, two other wallet addresses in the top 10 \u2014 each holding more than 550,000 ETH \u2014 are linked to crypto exchange giant Binance. Rounding off the top 10 are Arbitrum: Bridge, with holdings of over 1.3 million, and Bitfinex, with more than 450,000 ETH.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that an ETH address linked to Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum, named VB 3, holds more than 240,000 ETH.\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

As BTC and ETH continued to rally this year due to rising open interests (OI), a record rise in funding rates stalled the rally at the end of the year.\n\nBTC price rallied 170% and ETH price leaped 105% this year. Experts anticipate further rally after the funding rates decline gradually.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum OI and Funding Rates\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum futures open interest (OI) fell after Friday\u2019s expiry and recent crypto market selloffs this week. However, traders remain positive on further upsides.\n\nAs per current data, the total Bitcoin futures OI on all exchanges is over $18 billion. BTC OI on CME and Binance are $4.81 billion and $4.31 billion, rising again after the recent wipe out. Deribit, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX, and others have similar figures.\n\nThe total Ethereum futures OI is $3.36 million. ETH OI on the top three futures crypto exchanges Binance, Bybit, and OKX are rising after a massive drop.\n\nCrypto influencer Kamikaz shared that OI is totally wiped on BTC and ETH after expiry but funding remains higher as people are scared to short due to spot Bitcoin ETF approval sentiment. He says it is super bullish and wants to long.\n\nPopular analyst CredibleCrypto agreed with Kamikaz that the market is bullish. He explained that people are mistaking high funding rates for an excess of over-leveraged participants. In reality, OI is completely wiped at levels not witnessed in the last few years. He said, \u201cfunding is only relatively high because the few that are levered are predominantly directional longs.\u201d\n\nFunding rates are also actually falling from the record high. The BTC OI-weighted funding rate chart indicates probability of upside movement in the next few days.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nVarinder Singh Varinder has 10 years of experience in the Fintech sector, with over 5 years dedicated to blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developments.

The spot bitcoin ETF, which will trade under the ticker BITB, is one of the several proposals awaiting approval from the U.S. regulator.\n\nThe $200 million investment would significantly boost Bitwise, surpassing the $10 million seed money that Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, announced for its own spot bitcoin ETF last week. Blackrock\u2019s ETF, which will trade under the ticker BTFD, is expected to launch on Jan. 3, 2024.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas commented on Bitwise\u2019s filing on social media platform X, saying:\n\nBitwise S-1 has been filed and it looks like someone (I wonder who) is going to seed BITB with $200m, which blows away Blackrock\u2019s $10m (that we know of). That\u2019s gonna be huge help in early days of race.\n\nHowever, the asset manager warned that the potential buyer\u2019s interest is not a binding commitment, and they could change their mind or purchase a different amount of shares.\n\nBitwise\u2019s Bullish Outlook On Bitcoin and ETFs\n\nBitwise is optimistic about the future of Bitcoin and the ETF industry, as revealed in its 10 crypto predictions for 2024 earlier this month. The firm expects Bitcoin to trade above $80,000 by the end of 2024, driven by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and innovation.\n\nBitwise also believes that the SEC will approve spot bitcoin ETFs in 2024 and that they will be the most successful ETF launch of all time. Bitwise estimates that spot bitcoin ETFs will capture 1% of the $7.2 trillion U.S. ETF market or $72 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBitwise is not the only firm vying for the first spot in Bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S. Other applicants include VanEck, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, NYDIG, and Galaxy Digital. The SEC has delayed its decision on several of these proposals, citing concerns over market manipulation, investor protection, and custody issues.

This surge in curiosity reflects the dynamic movements within Solana's ecosystem and hints at changing trends in the crypto community.\n\nSolana vs. Ethereum: A Shift in Search Dynamics\n\nThroughout most of 2023, Ethereum maintained a considerable lead over Solana in terms of search interest. However, the period from December 17 to December 23 marked a pivotal change, with Solana achieving a search interest score of 56 compared to Ethereum's 50. Google Trends forecasts that Solana's search interest will reach a peak score of 100 between December 24 and December 30, indicating \"peak popularity for the term.\"\n\nInterestingly, the surge in Solana's search interest is more pronounced in countries like Spain and the Philippines, while Ethereum continues to dominate in regions such as Indonesia, Taiwan, and Morocco.\n\nAssociated Search Trends and Market Movements\n\nUsers searching for Solana have also shown interest in terms like \"bonk\" and \"tensor.\" Bonk, a dog-themed memecoin, overtook Pepecoin in market capitalization on December 8 after witnessing a 370% monthly gain. Tensor, a Solana-based nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace, has created the Tensorians NFT collection, which also experienced significant gains in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana's increased search interest may be partly attributed to the recent rise in the price of its token. On December 20, Solana's market capitalization surpassed Ripple's XRP, with the token price increasing by 13.8%, reaching over $82 for the first time since May 2022. This surge briefly positioned Solana as the fourth-largest crypto token by market cap, surpassing BNB on December 22. However, by December 29, BNB regained its position as Solana's token prices returned to levels seen before Christmas."

That is not the top, that is not their peak,\u201d Armstrong stated.\n\nNotably, the current market value of Solana stands around $108.75 while XRP which is still below the $1 peg is trading at $0.63, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This would mean an around 1,000% increase for Solana and a 1,100% increase for XRP.\n\nArmstrong outlined a roadmap for his predictions, involving factors such as Ripple\u2019s Initial Public Offering (IPO) and the Ethereum Spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) becoming catalysts for the cryptocurrency\u2019s price surge.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the difference between XRP and Solana\u2019s bull run. Solana has had its run up into the bull. It will continue to do well but it already has massively overinflated numbers. XRP is going to slowly wind up and at the end when the Ripple IPO launches that\u2019s when XRP will go through the freaking roof. Because not only will it have the IPO, it will also have the Ethereum ETF going,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nXRP price recovers from crash | Source: XRP price recovers from crash | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nXRP To Outperform Solana\n\nIn his YouTube video, Armstrong predicted the future trajectory of XRP up to 2025. His projections revolve around the aftermath of the Ethereum Spot ETF potential launch and the possible introduction of an XRP ETF.\n\nThe crypto influencer expressed confidence in XRP outperforming Solana in the future. This prediction could be attributed to the recent positive developments occurring within the XRP ecosystem including the improved regulatory clarity and the widespread acceptance of XRP in major crypto exchanges and countries globally.\n\n\u201cWhen the ETF gets launched, Ethereum is going to go sky high but what\u2019s gonna happen is people are gonna start thinking about the next coin. What\u2019s the next one that\u2019s gonna get the ETF? This will be in 2025 when this happens. That\u2019s when the XRP gets to long tail at the end of the blow-off top. I think XRP ends the bull run, and Solana starts it,\u201d Armstrong stated.\n\nFeatured image from CoinGape, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "content": "JAKARTA - Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has shared plans for the Ethereum roadmap for 2024. He acknowledged that there were only minor changes compared to last year.\n\nIn a series of posts on platform X (formerly Twitter), Buterin explained that the focus continues for Ethereum in 2024 centered on six main components.\n\nFurthermore, in a detailed graph with annotations and diagrams, Buterin outlines these six elements the Merge, the Surge, the Scourge, the Verge, the Purge, and the Splurge.\n\nHe pointed out that, as Ethereum's technical direction became clearer, there were only a few minor adjustments compared to the 2023 road plan. \"As Ethereum's technical direction becomes clearer, there are relatively few changes,\" he said.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KUG\n\nThe Merger is highlighted as a key part of the road plan, aiming to maintain a simple and long-lasting proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.\n\nIn September 2022, the Merge took place, integrating the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake blockchain, Banyak Chain.\n\nFollowing the merger, the most significant observation on Ethereum is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that consumes high energy to PoS, resulting in a huge drop in network total energy consumption.\n\nHe also noted developments in Ethereum's single-slot finality (SSF). The finality aims to ensure that changes to blockchain block cannot be reversed without burning at least 33% of the total Ether at stake.\n\n\"The role of the single slot finality (SSF) in post-Merge PoS improvements is getting stronger. It is clear that SSF is the easiest path to solve most of the current Ethereum PoS design weaknesses,\" he said.\n\nThis comes after Cointelegraph recently reported that Buterin wanted to restore the original idea of a \"cypherpunk\" revolution to blockchain.\n\nCypherpunk refers to someone who uses encryption to ensure privacy when accessing computer networks, especially from government authorities.\n\nIn a post blog, Buterin explains that Ethereum was originally idealized as a \"public decentralized shared drive\" that could leverage peer-to-peer messaging and decentralized file storage.\n\nHowever, the vision began to fade in 2017 by turning towards financialization on Ethereum.\n\nButerin highlighted that rollups, proof of zero knowledge, account abstraction, and second generation privacy solutions have become more mainstream. He noted that this could support certain values related to the principle of cypherpunk.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "title": "Ultimate Guide To Rainbow Wallet Airdrop - CryptoTicker.io - Bitcoin Price, Ethereum Price & Crypto News",
        "content": "On December 13, 2023, Rainbow, the Ethereum wallet, unveiled its Rainbow Points rewards initiative, characterizing it as the inaugural move towards involving its community in the forthcoming prosperity of Rainbow. This announcement also hinted at the possibility of a future token airdrop. This article is all about the simple guide on Rainbow wallet airdrop. Let\u2019s take a look at this in more detail.\n\nRainbow is a mobile wallet designed for Ethereum, available on iOS and currently in public beta on Android. It\u2019s a non-custodial wallet, meaning you control your private keys and, consequently, your funds. Notably, Rainbow is open source, setting it apart from most other mobile crypto wallets.\n\nBuilt with both beginners and power users in mind, Rainbow offers a variety of features to cater to different needs.

The technology is excessively complex, and financial aspects are laden with intricate numerical details. Furthermore, the industry is plagued by a prevalence of scams.\n\nSome decentralized applications, often referred to as dapps in crypto parlance (although jargon itself is a concern), proudly emulate a visual style reminiscent of the early 1990s. This era harkens back to a time when engaging in enjoyable online activities required navigating through command lines.\n\nA noteworthy illustration of this phenomenon is MetaMask, the most widely utilized application within the Web3 framework. Originating as one of ConsenSys\u2019 initial in-house projects for Ethereum software development, MetaMask has evolved into a pivotal component of the Web3 ecosystem. With a recent tally revealing more than 30 million active monthly users, MetaMask has emerged as the default tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to oversee and manage their cryptographic keys.\n\nFrom a consumer standpoint, wallets stand out as the cornerstone tools for fostering crypto adoption. These applications play a central role in safeguarding wealth, facilitating fund transactions, and orchestrating the management of one\u2019s Web3 existence. While MetaMask is certainly a competent wallet, the crypto industry, founded on the principle of trusting the invisible hand of the market, necessitates the presence of robust and competitive alternatives to ensure a dynamic ecosystem.\n\nRainbow Wallet stands out with its noteworthy features and integrations, making it a compelling choice for users in the crypto space:\n\nAPI Access:\n\n\u2013 Rainbow Wallet provides API access, enhancing its functionality and integrative capabilities.\n\nIntegrations:\n\nMintable\n\nSnowCone\n\nUnstoppable Domains\n\nWalletConnect\n\nX (Twitter)\n\nSpookySwap\n\nVezgo\n\nAutoMinter\n\nDEUS Finance\n\nDeri\n\nLlamaPay\n\nMyEtherWallet (MEW)\n\nNEAR\n\nNiftyzone\n\nTactic\n\nWanchain Wallet\n\nhop.cash\n\nRainbow Wallet\u2019s extensive list of integrations, ranging from popular platforms like Mintable and Unstoppable Domains to diverse decentralized finance (DeFi) projects such as DEUS Finance and SpookySwap, ensures a versatile and interconnected experience for users.\n\n\u2014> Use This Link to get 100x points on Rainbow! <\u2014\n\nHow Rainbow Points are distributed and how you can earn them?\n\nAnyone with an Ethereum wallet qualifies: Whether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto user or just starting out, owning an Ethereum wallet makes you eligible to earn Rainbow Points.\n\nSwitching from MetaMask to Rainbow? Great choice! Import your MetaMask wallet, and if you\u2019ve used MetaMask\u2019s swap feature in the past year, you can earn an extra 150k points for an enhanced Ethereum experience.\n\n\u2014> Use This Link to get 100x points on Rainbow! <\u2014"

        "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an Ethereum roadmap for ecosystem development in 2024. Analysts expect Ethereum to reach $5,300. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has become a complete ecosystem that supports decentralized apps and digital currencies.\n\nPal Targets $5,300 Using Liquidity Indicator\n\nReal Vision co-founder and CEO Raoul Pal has also boosted Ethereum optimism. Pal anticipates Ethereum\u2019s value to rise significantly in the first half of 2024 using the liquidity indicator, a measure experts use to predict price changes. Pal\u2019s confidence matches the overall positive outlook for Ethereum, but such estimates are speculative.\n\nEthereum is anticipated to perform exceptionally well in the first half of 2024. Using the liquidity indicator, aim for $5,300. Ethereum may hit its peak in the first half of 2024, Pal said.\n\nPal noted that ETFs may affect Ethereum\u2019s performance. He thinks a Bitcoin ETF might lead to an Ethereum ETF, reviving Ethereum.\n\nThe revised Vitalik Buterin approach for 2024 matches Pal\u2019s bullish predictions. The co-founder highlighted many major improvements, including the addition of Single Slot Finality (SSF) to the post-Merge Proof-of-Stake (PoS) update. The SSF can fix Ethereum\u2019s Proof of Stake (PoS) architecture, speeding up and improving transactional security.\n\nTrending Now: SlowMist Exposes Unauthorized Approvals Leading to Crypto Thefts\n\nButerin stressed that SSF (Stateless Ethereum) is the easiest way to fix numerous Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) design flaws. EIP-4844 and rollup advancements have also helped engineers make breakthroughs in other sectors like the Surge. These enhancements will let Ethereum handle higher workloads and run more effectively, which are essential to its success.\n\nButerin Tackles Ethereum\u2019s PoS Challenges with Scourge Redesign\n\nButerin\u2019s approach addresses PoS economic centralization difficulties with the revised Scourge. The integrity and decentralization of the Ethereum network are the main goals of this overhaul, which addresses issues like Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and stake pooling.\n\nHowever, progress has been difficult. Current designs\u2019 cryptographic flaws make Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) challenging for developers. Despite these challenges, the development team persists in studying and improving these services, demonstrating a strong dedication to the project\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s broad strategy and analysts like Raoul Pal\u2019s optimism support Ethereum\u2019s path. Ethereum\u2019s focused efforts to overcome technological difficulties and make improvements show a commitment to its development and originality, bolstering its position in the developing cryptocurrency market."
