        "content": "A recent conversation with Vitalik Buterin on X platform sheds light on a few important topics regarding L2 networks \u2013 the main scalability tool for the Ethereum network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core, an L2 solution is a secondary framework or protocol built atop the Ethereum blockchain, designed to increase transaction capacity and speed without compromising the security provided by the main chain, known as layer 1 (L1). This conversation is vital because it helps users understand the types of solutions available and their respective tradeoffs.\n\nYeah I agree with this. I called them \"security-favoring\" vs \"scale-favoring\" here, but we can probably come up with better terms (\"strong L2\" vs \"light L2\" perhaps?)https://t.co/oSPZkB3Xo3 \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 16, 2024\n\nButerin participated in a discussion clarifying that \"L2s\" encompass both rollups and validiums. The distinction is important for users to grasp the different security and scalability features. Rollups are \"security-favoring\" solutions that bundle or \"roll up\" transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain.\n\nThis process allows for high security, as the L1 blockchain directly secures them. In contrast, validiums are \"scale-favoring,\" designed to boost capacity by storing data off-chain but with proofs still on-chain, offering slightly less security for much greater scalability.\n\nThe distinction is nuanced but significant. While rollups are more expensive due to the data being posted on-chain, they offer higher security. Validiums, on the other hand, provide a cheaper alternative, with a slight tradeoff in security. Buterin suggests that the terminology should reflect these differences without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he proposes terms like \"strong L2\" for rollups and \"light L2\" for validiums to help users navigate their choices better.\n\nInterestingly, Buterin also points out that the architecture of L2 solutions is not strictly about security levels. He previously attempted to categorize these layers but recognized that there is a significant \"intermediate space\" between rollups and validiums, further complicating the classification."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s journey towards a more scalable and efficient blockchain encountered a significant roadblock when the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade failed to achieve finalization on the Goerli testnet today. Activated at 6:32 UTC, the upgrade\u2019s inability to reach consensus has injected uncertainty into the timeline for its deployment on the mainnet, prompting a detailed examination of the factors at play.\n\nEthereum Dencun Fails To Finalize \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\n\nEthStaker, a prominent voice in the Ethereum staking community, shed light on the complexities underpinning the non-finalization issue. \u201cThe low participation on Goerli suggests a mix of potential client issues and a lack of updated validators. While not overly concerning in the short term, this does necessitate a deep dive into whether these issues stem from validators not upgrading their systems or more systemic client-side problems,\u201d EthStaker explained.\n\nAnd it seems like we have a chain split! Client teams are looking into it, but it's likely to a while to pin down + fix the issues. Keep an eye out for updates! \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) January 17, 2024\n\nTerence Tsao from Offchain Labs elaborated on the multifactorial aspects contributing to the testnet\u2019s challenges. \u201cWith a participation rate hovering around 80%, the key to losing finality often lies in approximately 10% of validators being offline,\u201d he stated.\n\nThis may be due to several factors, including failure to update software components or the presence of bugs. \u201cGiven Goerli\u2018s diverse validator composition, it\u2019s premature to conclusively determine the root cause of the issue at hand,\u201d Tsao remarked.\n\nHe advocated for a comprehensive and time-intensive analysis before making any definitive judgments about the Dencun upgrade\u2019s success or potential delays. Proto Lambda, an Ethereum scaling and R&D expert, pinpointed a specific technical mishap that exacerbated the situation. \u201cThe accidental removal of \u2018historical roots\u2019 from the beacon state by Prysm led to a network split. This highlights the intricate challenges in managing the beacon state, a pivotal component of Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism,\u201d Proto Lambda highlighted.\n\nEthereum Goerli upgraded to Dencun / EIP-4844 \ud83c\udf89 And historicalRoots accidentally dropped from the beacon state by Prysm & a resulting network split \ud83d\ude05 pic.twitter.com/5jHU6pq2vX \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) January 17, 2024\n\nThe beacon state\u2019s evolution, especially with the implementation of SSZ tree hashing, was meant to streamline state management, including the handling of the HistoricalSummary container. This container plays a crucial role for light clients and in creating Merkle proofs against past states.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844)\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, deeply intertwined with EIP-4844, represents a cornerstone in Ethereum\u2019s strategy for scaling and enhancing network efficiency. EIP-4844\u2019s introduction of blob-carrying transactions is a groundbreaking step towards reducing gas costs by facilitating temporary data storage in beacon nodes. This move is expected to significantly enhance transaction throughput and lower fees, providing immediate relief and setting a foundation for future scalability solutions.\n\nProto-danksharding, a term coined from the contributions of researchers Protolambda and Dankrad Feist, underpins this process. It represents a simplified yet potent version of danksharding, aiming to radically cut down gas fees and improve transactional efficiency. This development is a crucial part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling roadmap, ensuring compatibility and future readiness with the network\u2019s long-term strategic vision.\n\nImplications And Future Steps\n\nThe Ethereum community and developers are now racing against time to resolve these unforeseen challenges.\n\nTsao stated:\n\nPrysm encountered a bug right at Goerli\u2019s hard fork. The bug has been identified, and a fix is currently being merged. A hot patch image will be released within the next few hours. Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience!\n\nThe transition from Goerli to Sepolia, and eventually to the Holesky testnet, signifies a cautious but strategic approach in Ethereum\u2019s upgrade rollout.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well with the testnets, my own personal estimate for Dencun on mainnet is mid-late March,\u201d Sassal.eth, founder of The Daily Gwei, noted prior to the Dencun testnet upgrade. Following the faulty start, it is uncertain whether this schedule is still tenable.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,546.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com"

Days later, daily users jumped another 43%, reaching a new all-time high of 3,151 on January 15.\n\nTelegram bots are designed to simplify on-chain trading by letting users buy and sell tokens on decentralised exchanges \u2014 or DEXs \u2014 through the popular messaging app.\n\nThese features were trendy among meme coin traders on Ethereum last summer, as six of the top 10 trading pairs of all time were meme coins.\n\nUnibot\u2019s Solana launch has helped turn its fortunes around after falling use on Ethereum, where it was initially launched. Solana users now account for 90% of Unibot\u2019s users, and over 79% of the total volume.\n\nSince its Solana launch on January 4, Unibot earned $275,000 in fees to add to the $534,000 it earned in fees on Ethereum.\n\nThis is an over 50% increase in total fees generated that Unibot would not have had without integrating Solana.\n\nTotal volume generated by Unibot daily. (Dune: @Whale_Hunter)\n\nThe episode shows that Solana, which prides itself on low transaction fees and its dApps\u2019 slick interfaces, is winning over the DeFi degens who make up Unibot\u2019s user base.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nA second start with Solana\n\nUnibot\u2019s expansion to Solana comes as trading on the blockchain has boomed throughout December.\n\nDecentralised exchanges on Solana are now the third-most active among traders behind those built on Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\nLast summer, Ethereum also saw a similar memecoin mania to the one that just occurred on Solana, driven mainly by the advent of Telegram trading bots like Unibot and Maestro.\n\nAt its peak in August, Unibot facilitated over $8 million in daily trading volume through its Telegram trading interface, generating over 11,400 Ether worth $29.5 million in lifetime fees.\n\nBut with a significant portion of memecoin trading activity exiting Ethereum to other chains \u2014 most notably Solana \u2014 in recent months, Unibot\u2019s revenue has also dropped.\n\nNow, in what was a bid to boost revenues, trading bots popular among traders are following them to Solana. And it appears to be working.\n\nCompetitors follow suit\n\nOne of Unibot\u2019s main competitors, Banana Gun Bot, has also made the move to Solana.\n\nBanana Gun Bot saw similar success following its launch on Solana. The total fees generated on January 16 were the most since December 6, and the fourth highest all time.\n\nIn just three days, it has generated over 270 SOL in fees, worth approximately $27,000 at current prices.\n\nDaily active users also saw a bump, on January 16th 1,727 new users and 4,543 total users interacted with the bot. This is just below the previous all time high of 4,730 total users set on November 29.\n\nUNIBOT token\n\nThe price of Unibot\u2019s eponymous token has gone up by 85% over the past month, trading around $94.\n\nRevenues generated by Unibot are shared with token holders who hold at least 10 UNIBOT. Holders have received over 4,496 ETH in total rewards, valued at over $11.3 million at current prices.\n\nUnibot's token price\n\nToken holders can earn even more rewards by distributing their unique referral code to other users. Referrers earn 25% of the total fees generated by anyone who uses their referral code.\n\nHolders can expect to receive a 9.43% APR for staking."

The blockchain hosts thousands of applications and millions of active users as it drives a new era of financial authority. But as DeFi\u2019s leading blockchain, it must be well-equipped to scale as an influx of apps and users join the network.\n\nCurrently, there are limitations with the Ethereum protocol due to its (relatively) slow speeds and high transaction fees. These issues have led to the emergence of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) projects \u2013 designed to improve network performance and enable the continued expansion of the DeFi revolution.\n\nRelated: How to buy Ethereum in Australia\n\nWhat are Ethereum Layer 2s?\n\nAn Ethereum Layer 2 project is a network that operates on top of the main Ethereum blockchain (known as a \u201cLayer 1\u201d). Layer 2 projects allow decentralised applications (dApps) to funnel transactions and other processes off the main blockchain \u2013 which can reduce congestion, increase finality speeds and cheapen gas fees. Layer 2 chains make use of Ethereum\u2019s privacy and decentralised infrastructure while reducing the burden on its main network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow We Ranked Ethereum Layer 2s\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to determine which Ethereum Layer 2s maintain the healthiest ecosystem. A strong userbase, constant dApp development and high transaction volumes tend to indicate the long-term security and viability of a L2 project.\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL). This is the dollar-amount of cryptocurrency locked up in smart contracts on a blockchain. It encompasses staking services, DeFi savings account and so on.\n\nThis is the dollar-amount of cryptocurrency locked up in smart contracts on a blockchain.

Arbitrum can do everything Ethereum does \u2013 but faster and cheaper.\n\nArbitrum dominates the Ethereum L2 world, capturing nearly 50% of the market share. It has by far the highest total value locked (TVL) and monthly transaction data of any EVM scaling solution. It boasts hundreds of the DeFi ecosystem\u2019s most popular applications, including Uniswap, 1inch and Beefy Finance.\n\nArbitrum\u2019s governance token, ARB, allows holders to vote on proposals and participate in economic/development decisions of the L2.\n\nView live ARB price.\n\nOptimism\n\nOptimism is a community-focused Layer 2 framework that offers DeFi projects lightning-fast transaction speeds and lower costs to transmit data to and from the base Ether blockchain. Optimism is an optimistic rollup chain, which means a large batch of transactions are \u201crolled\u201d together and then processed on the Layer 1 network.\n\nOptimism is a clear number two when it comes to on-chain metrics, trailing only Arbitrum in Total Value Locked and market share. It is also home to the vast majority of popular Ethereum dApps, like Slingshot, Aave and Sushiswap. The network\u2019s native governance token is OP.\n\nView live OP price\n\nPolygon\n\nPolygon (MATIC), originally intended as a competitor to Ethereum, is now a scaling solution that intends to connect multiple blockchains to the network in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The L2 uses what\u2019s known as \u201csidechains\u201d, a web of independent networks that help decongest the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe network constantly jostles with Optimism as the L2 with the second-most total value locked and on any given day can boast more than USD $300m in transaction volume.\n\nThe Polygon team has also developed a separate zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) network that has a greater focus on security and superior transaction speeds to its counterpart.\n\nBASE\n\nBASE is a relatively new L2 solution developed by global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Like most other L2s, BASE uses rollups to bundle transactions together to optimise using EVM dApps.\n\nBASE is built atop Optimism\u2019s open-source stack, meaning it shares the same excellent scalability, interoperability and ease of development. Additionally, BASE is designed to be the blockchain for Coinbase use cases \u2013 allowing it to leverage the hundreds of millions in assets currently held on the exchange.\n\nBASE supports all of the main EVM apps you would want \u2013 AAVE, UniSwap and Banxa, along with some more unique offerings such as Friend.tech. And despite the L2\u2019s relative infancy, it still boasts excellent on-chain metrics, coming in the top five for TVL, market share and monthly transactions.\n\nLoopring\n\nLoopring is an Ethereum Layer 2 project that provides low fees and high speeds for trading, lending and engaging in other financial activities using ETH. The protocol uses zero-knowledge Rollups, allowing for near-instant finality.\n\nLoopring\u2019s key mission is to combine the benefits of centralised exchanges (liquidity and efficiency) and decentralised exchanges (greater freedom, cheaper transactions, no third-party) on Ethereum. The team also plans to improve the L2s interoperability by building support for chains other than Ether, such as Qtum and Neo.\n\nGiven its unique vision, Loopring lacks the same mass of dApps that some of its competitors do, but still offers impressive financial services (lending/borrowing, earning, NFT management and a trustless wallet). It ranks in the top 15 for total value locked.\n\nThe LRC token is native to Loopring\u2019s L2 for Ethereum. View LRC price live.\n\nImmutableX\n\nImmutableX is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution with one industry in mind \u2013 blockchain gaming. The demand for GameFi has increased over the years, and ImmutableX is the first L2 for NFTs. Like most other popular L2s, ImmutableX is built with zkRollups which has vastly improved the gaming experience for both developers and players.\n\nImmutableX is home to several highly-touted NFT marketplaces and GameFi platforms, including Gods Unchained, Illuvium and Guild of Guardians. The constant addition of new games has led to ImmutableX surging up the on-chain rankings, now sitting comfortably in the top ten for monthly transactions and TVL.\n\nView live IMX price.\n\nMetis\n\nMetisDAO is an Ethereum L2 with the goal of solving what many have called impossible \u2013 the blockchain trilemma. The Metis team wants to create a solution for Ethereum that\u2019s scalable, decentralised and secure. The protocol uses Optimistic Rollups to bundle transactions for faster procession on Ethereum, leading to lower gas fees and higher transaction throughput. The developers are also working on an evolution of these Rollups to further improve efficiency and on-chain privacy.\n\nMetis has an excellent list of supported dApps, including heavy-hitters OKX, Stargate and Metamask. It has the third-most total value locked of any Layer 2 network, thanks to its popularity surging in 2023. It also sits around the top 20 for monthly transaction volume.\n\nMETIS is the native token of the MetisDAO L2 and can be used to participate in governance.\n\nWhy Do People Use Layer 2 Networks?\n\nThe main Ethereum 1.0 blockchain currently has a low transaction speed of around 7-15 transactions per second (TPS). Layer 2 solutions can theoretically handle much faster speeds of up to 9,000 tps by pushing most of the hard processing \u201coff-chain\u201d \u2013 either through the use of sidechains or Rollups. Additionally, using the main Ethereum L1 can be quite a costly experience, which may turn away many potential adopters.\n\nThere are an increasing amount of layer 2 projects and sidechains in circulation, each working to improve the user experience for swapping coins and tokens, minting NFTs, reducing transaction fees and increasing the speed of transactions. This also makes it much cheaper for developers to host and improve their applications on Ethereum.\n\nHow to buy Layer 2 network tokens\n\nMost of the layer 2 networks listed above have native tokens that you can purchase to get exposure to these projects.\n\nSome tokens like ARB, OP and IMX are ranked in the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market, which shows the relevance of layer 2 networks in the market today. You can buy several layer 2 tokens on Australian crypto exchange, Swyftx.\n\nConclusion\n\nLayer 2s are the next frontier of Ethereum-based decentralised finance. The success of these protocols will have a big say in the adoption of EVM dApps over the next decade. As these projects work together to bring the next evolution of DeFi to the sector, it will be enthralling to watch if Ethereum can truly revolutionise the world of finance as we know it."

        "title": "What Is Immutable? The Ethereum Network for Crypto and NFT Games - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nImmutable X is a layer-2 scaling network built on top of Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. Developed by the Web3 firm Immutable via tech created by StarkWare, Immutable X uses the native ERC-20 token IMX and hosts a number of different blockchain games on its network like Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians, Illuvium, and Ember Sword, to name a few.\n\nWhile Ethereum proponents argue that its mainnet is among the most decentralized and secure of all cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s also historically suffered from high gas fees and long waits to make transactions. This has long caused friction with NFT creators like those behind the CryptoKitties, who once clogged the mainnet with their digital cats and made it virtually unusable.\n\nBecause NFTs\u2014unique blockchain tokens that signify ownership\u2014are currently so essential to blockchain games, it\u2019s unfeasible for most game developers to build on the Ethereum mainnet. That\u2019s where layer-2 solutions like Immutable X come in, plus Immutable is expanding with another new zkEVM scaling network ahead. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Immutable platform.\n\nWhat is Immutable X?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImmutable X is a gaming-focused protocol that\u2019s built atop the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s security, but with the speed and lower transaction costs of a layer-2 scaling network. In other words, it provides additional benefits on top of the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Immutable X\u2019s whitepaper, the network allows users to make transactions with zero gas fees. This is partly possible due to Immutable X\u2019s use of StarkWare\u2019s ZK rollup technology which bundles transactions and can enable over 9,000 NFT transactions per second.\n\nWho created Immutable X?\n\nImmutable is the main Web3 firm behind the Immutable X protocol. The company is part blockchain developer and part game publisher, as Immutable developed the NFT card-battling game Gods Unchained and is publishing the action role-playing game Guild of Guardians.\n\nPer Crunchbase data, Immutable has raised nearly $280 million in funding from 32 investors as of January 2024, with firms like Tencent, GameStop Digital Ventures, King River Capital, and the now-defunct Alameda Research investing.\n\nHow does Immutable X work?\n\nImmutable X supports all Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Users can also create an Immutable Passport to transact on the network. Immutable Passport is designed to be a streamlined and more approachable crypto wallet for gamers, plus it provides a unified identity across games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe protocol itself sits on top of the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for Immutable X to leverage the mainnet\u2019s decentralization and security for finalizing transactions. But because Immutable X uses ZK rollups, its transactions on its layer-2 network are still able to be fast and cost-effective.\n\nImmutable has built multiple REST application programming interfaces (APIs), meaning they are APIs that adhere to a specific set of architectural standards. Immutable\u2019s REST APIs mean that transactions can consist of an API call, which takes less time than engaging with a protocol directly via a smart contract.\n\nWho's using Immutable X?\n\nA number of different NFT marketplaces and game developers have chosen to offer their products and services on ImmutableX. In June 2022, Immutable Ventures established a massive $500 million fund to invest in Web3 gaming projects being built on Immutable X and to also provide various developers with grant-based funding.\n\nRarible, Mintable, NFTrade, TokenTrove, OKX, and Kinguin are NFT marketplaces that use Immutable X. Brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop also launched its NFT marketplace on Immutable X in 2022, but has since discontinued its own crypto wallet and has said that it will shut down its marketplace in February 2024.\n\nGames like IMVU, Guild of Guardians, Habbo, Cross the Ages, Undead Blocks, Ember Sword, Planet Quest, Gods Unchained, WAGMI Defense, and Tiny Colony are building their Web3 elements on Immutable X.\n\nAs the world of Web3 gaming heats up, Immutable X faces competition with other blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum Nova, Sui, and Solana to offer a fast and seamless gaming experience.\n\nWhat is Immutable zkEVM?\n\nImmutable is developing more than just Immutable X as its Ethereum gaming platform expands. In March 2023, the firm announced that it is working with competitor Polygon to develop a new Immutable zkEVM scaling network that combines Polygon zkEVM technology with Immutable\u2019s gaming platform.\n\nA number of games have already announced that they\u2019ll be using the Immutable zkEVM, from MetalCore to Shardbound and Elemental Knights. According to an Immutable blog post, the zkEVM network provides native compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, potentially making it easier for developers to port over from EVM chains and utilize an array of third-party tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Immutable platform grows, the IMX token has become the most valuable gaming token as of this writing, with a market cap of nearly $2.7 billion. That makes it the 37th largest overall cryptocurrency by market cap according to data from CoinGecko, as of January 17, 2024.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "While the Bitcoin price has been consolidating largely post-ETF approval, Ethereum (ETH) has been making strong upside moves, thereby closing the gap with BTC. At press time, the Ethereum price is trading 1.44% up at a price of $2,564 with a market cap of $308 billion.\n\nThe Ethereum Price Dominance\n\nAccording to insights provided by on-chain data provider Santiment, Ethereum\u2019s price dominance has experienced a notable surge against Bitcoin, marking a +22.4% increase over the past week. This period has witnessed the creation of 89.4K new Ethereum addresses per day, further underscoring the platform\u2019s growing traction. Notably, a staggering 96.3K wallets were created just yesterday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn addition to these on-chain activities, Santiment\u2019s data reveals a significant trend in Ethereum\u2019s supply on exchanges, nearing its All-Time Low of 8.05%. This movement toward self-custody and staking implies a reduced risk of an imminent selloff, presenting a more favorable scenario compared to concerns arising from a rising supply on exchanges. These on-chain dynamics shed light on Ethereum\u2019s current market strength and its potential implications for future price movements.\n\nETH Price Action Going Ahead\n\nIn the recent trading session on Tuesday, Ethereum price initially experienced a slight pullback, testing the crucial $2,500 level. Notably, this level had previously served as significant resistance but now appears to be providing substantial support for the cryptocurrency. The price action suggests Ethereum\u2019s attempt to enter a consolidation phase.\n\nThe $2,700 level emerges as a key threshold, representing the upper boundary of the short-term trading range. Analysts consider this level crucial, and a breakthrough could set the stage for a potential market surge, with Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) traders likely to join the rally. Beyond $2,700, the Ethereum price could further rally all the way to $3,400.\n\nConversely, a downside scenario could unfold if the second-largest crypto by market cap breaks below the hammer formed during the Monday session. In such a case, the cryptocurrency might see a downward movement toward the 20-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), situated around the $2,300 level. Traders are closely monitoring these critical levels, anticipating potential shifts in Ethereum\u2019s short-term trajectory.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.\n\nEthereum's correction is temporary\n\nThe Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.\n\nA closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.\n\nThis corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.\n\nBitcoin's dominance not going anywhere\n\nAfter a brief breach below the 50-day EMA \u2014 a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment \u2014 Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.\n\nHowever, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.\n\nThe recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.\n\nYet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet."

        "title": "An Introduction to ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) Standard - Unchained",
        "content": "The new ERC-4337 token standard enables account abstraction for Ethereum users, allowing for the creation of easier-to-use \u201csmart wallets.\u201d\n\nA significant impediment to crypto adoption is the complexity of account management. But that could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s newest token standard, ERC-4337.\n\nThis guide will explain what ERC-4337 is, how it works, and its significance to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhat Is the ERC-4337 Token Standard?\n\nERC-4337 is an account abstraction standard for the Ethereum blockchain, seeking to improve user experience and security by introducing smart contract functionality in wallets.\n\nThe standard is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s and other developers\u2019 brainchild, conceptualized in 2021.\n\nWhat Is Account Abstraction?\n\nIn most blockchain systems, users manage their transactions through Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). These accounts require them to own private keys and use them to process each transaction, creating challenges such as security risks, limited functionality, and usage complexity.\n\nTo address these challenges, Ethereum is adopting account abstraction.\n\nThis blockchain concept shifts user transactions away from exclusive dependence on EOAs. Instead, it embeds smart contracts in users\u2019 wallets, allowing them to interact with other contracts and thus complete exchanges automatically.\n\nBesides automating transactions, these \u201csmart wallets\u201d can determine the appropriate gas fees a user should incur in each exchange. They also support advanced security features, as we shall see later.\n\nKey Features of the ERC-4337 Standard\n\nA deep dive into the ERC-4337 standard reveals the following key features:\n\nUser Operations (UserOps) : Imagine it as a list of all the actions you provide your Ethereum account to execute.\n\nBundlers : The nodes that submit UserOps to the network for verification.\n\nEntryPoin t: The smart contract that performs UserOps.\n\nPaymaster : This entity manages the gas payment system.\n\nHow Does ERC-4337 Work?\n\nERC-4337 token standard transactions undergo a four-stage process.\n\nThe first is the initiation of UserOps, which are instructions for the desired actions, for example, sending tokens. The unconfirmed transactions go to an alternative mempool specifically built for ERC-4337 exchanges.\n\nThe bundlers then select several UserOps from the mempool and pack them into a single transaction called the bundle. Gas fees are the primary determinant of which UserOp the bundlers prioritize. From here, they send the bundle to EntryPoint, a global smart contract on the Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nFor validation, bundlers trigger the \u201chandleOps\u201d call function on the EntryPoint. That allows the smart contract to receive the bundle transactions. Consequently, it requests a \u201cvalidate UserOp\u201d function for every account, enabling authentication of the operation\u2019s signature.\n\nOnce everything checks out, the EntryPoint processes the appropriate gas fees. Every ERC-4337 wallet must then perform another function to complete the transaction sent to them by the EntryPoint contract. Bundlers receive payments for each successful UserOp to incentivize their facilitation of the process.\n\nBenefits and Limitations of ERC-4337\n\nAccording to its proponents, ERC-4337 will fundamentally transform Ethereum for the better. But as with any technology, it also has its downsides. Let\u2019s look at its potential positives and negatives.\n\nPros\n\nEnhanced Security: The token standard removes the complexity of managing private keys and seed phrases, enhancing security with two-factor authentication and biometrics.\n\nCross-chain compatibility: The standard works across multiple blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nPotential Scalability: ERC-4337 batches transactions akin to rollups, which could increase the Ethereum network\u2019s throughput for the benefit of its users.\n\nSupports multi-party transactions: ERC-4337 supports creating shared dealings with other parties through multi-signature operations and sponsored transactions, enabling a third party, such as a dApp or another wallet, to pay your gas fees.\n\nSocial wallet recovery: With ERC-4337, you can whitelist certain addresses to assist in account recovery if you lose your logins.\n\nCons\n\nIt lacks true account abstraction: Currently, ERC-4337 only provides an off-chain medium for managing your transactions before sending them to the mainnet. Proper account abstraction is more comprehensive, requiring a significant update of Ethereum\u2019s consensus protocol.\n\nIncreased DoS risk: The standard\u2019s complex verification process could heighten exposure to denial-of-service (DoS) exploits.\n\nLimited Transaction Volumes: ERC-4337 accounts can only send one transaction to the mempool at a time.\n\nPotentially Higher Gas Costs: Adopters of ERC-4337 transactions could pay more gas than they would do in regular transactions.\n\nWhat Is the Role of the ERC-4337 Standard to Ethereum Users?\n\nThe ERC-4337 token standard is still developing in the Ethereum network and will likely grow in adoption and function. Adopters can put its features to many uses, including:\n\nCustomizing spending: Users can tailor-make their transactions by setting wallet usage instructions and spending limits. Again, they can activate notifications for certain margins. This way, their smart wallets will act similarly to the regular credit card.\n\nSubscribing to Web3 services: As the standard supports account programming, users can factor in periodic spending in their wallet\u2019s code. Similarly, they can set up other crypto-specific pay-to-use plans.\n\nAutomating DeFi functions: Your smart wallet readily interacts with different decentralized applications critical to the DeFi sector . So you can instruct it to automate certain DeFi functions, like seeking the best liquidity pools for your funds.\n\nMulti-token gas payments: ERC-4337 expands your gas-paying options because its account abstraction feature facilitates fee payment with any ERC-20 token. That eliminates the need to hold or convert your holdings to a particular token for gas payments.\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe deployment of the ERC-4337 token standard on the Ethereum mainnet has stirred the crypto community for good reasons. Chief among them is its ability to streamline the crypto adoption process. That said, it comes with its fair share of challenges necessitating care in its adoption.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s for sure is that it is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to alter the Web3 user experience."

        "content": "In the dynamic crypto landscape, Arbitrum has kept pace with Ethereum, executing 375.3 million transactions in 2023, solidifying its position in the Layer 2 network revolution.\n\nLet\u2019s see all the details of CoinGecko\u2019s new 2023 cryptocurrency report in the article.\n\nCrypto Arbitrum challenges Ethereum mainnet with 375.3 million transactions\n\nAs anticipated, according to the new CoinGecko report, last year the Arbitrum crypto handled 375.3 million transactions, almost on par with the 383.1 million on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nMore generally, in 2023, Layer 2 networks have totaled over 1.31 billion transactions, of which precisely 375.3 million on Arbitrum, constituting 28.6% of L2 transactions on Ethereum.\n\nArbitrum has accounted for over a third (37.5%) of transactions on Ethereum Layer 2, excluding opBNB.\n\nThis system has also almost matched the number of transactions of the Ethereum mainnet, which recorded 383.1 million transactions in 2023.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, transactions on L2 grew by 93.8%, reaching 659.0 million compared to the previous quarter\u2019s 340.0 million.\n\nThe significant increase is mainly attributable to opBNB, with 304.8 million transactions (47.6%) in the fourth quarter, mainly due to an increase in registrations. In fact, in December alone, the network recorded several days with over 20 million transactions.\n\nIn addition to these remarkable achievements for Arbitrum, the CoinGecko report also provides valuable information on the 2023 performance of Bitcoin, Solana, NFT, and more.\n\nThe beginning of 2024 for Arbitrum: increase in DEX volume and historical TVL\n\nThe level 2 network, Arbitrum, built on the Ethereum blockchain, has started the new year with a strong performance. The platform has indeed shown significant increases both in trading volume and in the valuation of its native token, ARB.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from DeFiLlama, the volume of decentralized exchanges (DEX) on Arbitrum has surpassed other blockchains, including names like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polygon, in the last week.\n\nSurprisingly, on January 5th, the DEX volume on Arbitrum briefly surpassed that of the Ethereum mainnet, reaching a remarkable milestone.\n\nThis success can be mainly attributed to the increase in cryptocurrency investors who take advantage of the network\u2019s affordable transaction fees.\n\nAccording to the data from L2Fees, Arbitrum is one of the cheapest networks for transactions, with an average fee of 0.26 dollars, unlike the Ethereum network with an average fee of over 5 dollars.\n\nThis could explain the significant increase in trading volume on Arbitrum DEXs.\n\nFurthermore, the on-chain data from L2Beat indicates that Arbitrum is among the top three layer 2 networks based on Ethereum, with an average of 12.85 daily transactions.\n\nThe increase in DEX volume and intensified network activities have generated a peak in the total value locked (TVL) within the blockchain.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the blockchain has recorded a net positive flow of over 250 million dollars. This has brought Arbitrum\u2019s TVL to an impressive all-time high of 2.64 billion dollars on January 12th.\n\nDespite its remarkable success, the ARB token of Arbitrum has suffered a significant impact due to the recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Specifically, it has experienced a decrease of about 10% and is currently positioned at approximately $2.13.\n\nBrief focus on the price of Arbitrum and the upcoming airdrop\n\nCurrently, the price of Arbitrum (ARB) is around $2.08, with a trading volume of $576,853,819.67 in the last 24 hours. This represents a decrease of 3.32% in prices over the course of one day.\n\nHowever, during the same period, there has been an increase of 3.94%, particularly in the last seven days. The market capitalization of Arbitrum is $2,655,026,574, with a circulating supply of 1.3 billion ARB.\n\nWe see that Arbitrum is currently conducting an airdrop of its native token, ARB, targeting users who have previously used specific Ethereum-based applications.\n\nThe goal is to encourage users to explore the Arbitrum network and promote the adoption of the protocol.\n\nUsers interested in participating in the airdrop must meet certain criteria.\n\nAmong these, creating a bridge in Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova, conducting transactions in different months, executing a series of transactions with various smart contracts, and making transactions with a cumulative value exceeding a certain threshold in dollars.\n\nDespite the recent decrease of 3.32% in prices, Arbitrum (ARB) has recorded a 3.90% increase in the last seven days, surpassing the global cryptocurrency market decline of -5.20%.\n\nHowever, it has shown a slight underperformance compared to similar cryptocurrencies in the Ethereum ecosystem, which have recorded an increase of 12.70%."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered a substantial obstacle following a significant surge last week.\n\nThe market is currently correcting, and traders are wondering whether a reversal is on the horizon.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been very bullish over the last quarter of 2023, increasing by more than $1,000. Recently, ETH has experienced an aggressive rally toward the $2,700 resistance zone. However, this level has decisively rejected the price, and a correction toward the $2,400 area has begun.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index still demonstrates values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish and the price is likely to continue its uptrend after the correction is done.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour chart, it is clear that ETH\u2019s price has formed a double-top pattern at the $2,700 resistance level. The relative strength index also signaled that the asset is overbought in this timeframe.\n\nCurrently, the price is forming lower highs and lows, potentially targeting the $2,400 level in the short term. Yet, this level seems likely to hold the price and initiate a rebound back toward the $2,700 level afterward, as the overall market structure is still bullish.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s price is still continuing its bullish trend, some worrying signs are arising from the derivatives market. It is beneficial to have a closer look to determine whether a bearish reversal can be expected or not.\n\nThis chart depicts the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, one of the most valuable metrics for futures market sentiment evaluation. Values over 1 indicate that the bulls are executing their orders more aggressively, while values below 1 point to the bearish selling pressure.\n\nWhile the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has never recovered above one during the recent uptrend, the price has been rallying higher. However, it is currently dropping rapidly, making a new low. This cannot be interpreted well, and the subsequent aggressive selling pressure by the futures trader can soon cause a considerable decline in price."

        "content": "The latest developer report from Electric Capital reveals a sobering decline in the active crypto development workforce, despite Ethereum\u2019s strong pull on new talent and the rise of multi-chain development.\n\nMost crypto developers who joined in 2022 did not stay beyond their first year, according to a new report.\n\nThe Electric Capital Developer Report for 2023 has cast new light on the sector\u2019s challenges, revealing a 25% decline in active developers over the last year, with a total of 22,266 as of the end of 2023, down from 29,606 in the same period of 2022. This drop underscores the industry\u2019s vulnerability to market swings and raises questions about the sustainability of its workforce.\n\nThe report also highlights a concerning trend in developer retention, particularly among newcomers. Most developers who joined in 2022 did not stay beyond their first year, resulting in a 53% drop in new entrants. Despite this, there was a silver lining: namely, a 32% increase in the number of established developers \u2014 those with over two years of experience in the field. This growth in seasoned professionals suggests a maturing market, where experience is increasingly valued and likely correlated with the complex development needs of advanced blockchain projects.\n\nElectric Capital\u2019s annual developer report is based on tracking of different ecosystems and code and candidate repositories.\n\nEthereum Is Still Number One\n\nDespite the industry-wide downturn, Ethereum has solidified its position as the epicentre for developer activity, attracting 17,146 new developers in 2023. This influx is 2.7 times the number recorded by the next largest ecosystem, underscoring Ethereum\u2019s strong appeal to developers. The platform has emerged as the starting point for 22% of all new developers entering the crypto domain.\n\nPolygon and Solana trail Ethereum, having onboarded a little over 6,300 and 4,600 new developers, respectively.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains\n\nremain dominant, with only 2 of the top 10 blockchains for new devs being non-EVM \u2014 Solana and Cosmos.\n\nOrdinals Give Bitcoin a Boost\n\nAmid the broader contraction, Bitcoin Ordinals have emerged as a niche yet noteworthy area of growth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While the overall developer count in Bitcoin represents only 2% of the global share, with 1,067 active open-source contributors, the Ordinals Inscriptions sector has attracted 36 developers. This figure, although modest, signals a specific, targeted interest within a development community that is otherwise experiencing a general decline.\n\nThis surge is particularly interesting due to some in the Bitcoin community urging for Ordinals to be discontinued because they have slowed down the network. Others, meanwhile, highlight that without Ordinals, the block rewards wouldn\u2019t suffice to keep incentivizing miners to validate transactions\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Fees Surge to Highest Level Since April 2021\n\nMulti-Chain Developers\n\nAnother noteworthy trend is the increasing number of developers who are not confined to working on a single chain. Approximately 35% of developers now engage with more than one blockchain, indicating a shift toward a more interconnected and versatile development environment.\n\nAmid the overall decline, several ecosystems have demonstrated exceptional growth. dYdX leads the pack with a 520% surge in full-time monthly active developers, while Coinbase\u2019s Base has registered a 420% increase. In terms of total monthly active developers, Base and Scroll saw their numbers swell by 489% and 345%, respectively."

        "content": "There's an expected decline in Manta's TVL after January 18 due to participants claiming rewards from the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s layer-two (L2) blockchain Manta Pacific registered more than $850 million in total value locked (TVL) today, and it is now the 4th largest L2 by TVL, according to data aggregator L2Beat. When compared to the $35 million in TVL on December 15, 2023, this represents more than 2,300% in monthly growth.\n\nThe relevant rise in TVL can be related to Manta\u2019s New Paradigm campaign, which started last year on December 14 and gave rewards to users who bridged Ethereum (ETH) to Manta Pacific. The rewards are \u2018box pieces\u2019 and when a user gets 25 of them, he\u2019s eligible to open a box and get a non-fungible token (NFT). Inviting friends with referral links also boosted the rewards.\n\nManta Pacific is a blockchain ecosystem built by Manta Network on Ethereum. It leverages Polygon\u2019s zkEVM technology and uses Celestia, a modular blockchain, as its data availability layer. This architecture enables Manta Pacific to function as a zero-knowledge rollup (zk rollup) for Ethereum, offering scalability and privacy benefits.\n\nSince the start of the campaign, Manta\u2019s TVL has soared and reached an $870 million peak on January 12. However, this number could sharply decline after January 18, when users will be eligible to claim their rewards after participating in the New Paradigm campaign.\n\nA blog post published by Manta\u2019s team on January 15 reveals that 50 million MANTA tokens will be distributed to New Paradigm\u2019s participants. Another 50 million MANTA will be airdropped to users who interacted with the \u2018Into the Blue\u2019 event, which was similar to New Paradigm\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe value locked growth was not accompanied by a rise in activity and could be seen as a sign that the money flowing into Manta Pacific is coming from investors only interested in the airdrop.\n\nThus, the token distribution could be seen by investors as the end of the period when it\u2019s mandatory to lock ETH in Manta Pacific. Since 2024 is seen as \u2018airdrop season\u2019 by analysts, as Crypto Briefing reported, the money could quickly flow to other protocols where staking crypto is an eligibility requirement."

Back in February 2023, the pro Fortnite player known as \u201cMongraal\u201d won the first version of Dookey Dash with the highest score\u2014and sold his winning NFT key to billionaire Adam Weitsman for $1.63 million.\n\nThat said, those who do hold Yuga Labs Ethereum NFTs like Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Kodas, Bored Ape Kennel Club dogs, and HV-MTL Forge NFTs will be eligible for \u201ctoken benefits,\u201d according to the company. The trailer posted to Twitter shows ApeCoin logos, suggesting the Ethereum token for Yuga\u2019s Bored Ape ecosystem will be given out as rewards. However, a Yuga Labs representative would not confirm that detail.\n\nThe new Dookey Dash: Unclogged game will be released for iOS, Android, Mac desktop, and Windows desktop users\u2014suggesting it won\u2019t be a web browser-based game like before. Mobile and desktop app-based games tend to run more smoothly and securely than browser-based games, so this is a win for fans of the stinky original.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bored Ape and gaming influencer known as The Fortnite Guy or \u201cTFG,\u201d who was part of the latest Dookey Dash playtest and Yuga Labs\u2019 gaming council, added Tuesday that the game is slated for a mid-February launch and that select Yuga NFT holders may get more NFTs via the game.\n\nTFG showed a video that displays different playable character skins, new game vehicles, a leaderboard, and purchasable in-game currencies in the new upcoming game version. Yuga Labs\u2019 official gaming account on Twitter shared TFG\u2019s video.\n\nThe new version of Dookey Dash appears to offer \u201cCoins,\u201d \u201cBoosters,\u201d \u201cEnergy,\u201d \u201cSkip-It\u201d passes, and other items available for purchase using fiat currency. TFG also stated that coins can be earned by playing the game.\n\nDOOKEY DASH IS BACK!\ud83e\udd2f I've been invited to the @YugaLabsGaming council to playtest, create content, and work alongside the Yuga team to improve the game ahead of launch!\ud83d\ude4f There is SO MUCH new information about the game and I created a full length video discussing the updates\u2026 pic.twitter.com/MLFqaEw8e0 \u2014 TFG (@TFGmykL) January 16, 2024\n\nThe video also shows a new \u201cSewer Rank\u201d system to show the game\u2019s different competitive tiers. There\u2019s Amateur at the bottom, followed by Semi-Pro, Professional, All-Star, Champion, Hall of Famer, and GOAT listed as the game\u2019s ranked tiers, each with a different respective \u201cboost\u201d percentage. Players will be able to select different boosters before the game starts, with options like a \u201cslow booster,\u201d a \u201cmagnet booster,\u201d and a \u201cpower shart,\u201d for example.\n\nPresumably, the slow booster slows down the game to make it easier to navigate the cramped tunnels, while the magnet pulls in desirable items for the player to collect, and the \u201cpower shart\u201d is\u2026 well, mostly likely Dookey Dash\u2019s version of a very putrid nitro boost through the cartoonish game world.\n\nThe game\u2019s updated version and re-release appears to be an effort to draw in the broader crypto community. Hopefully, this new version won\u2019t suffer from quite the same levels of reported cheating and boosting as its original.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Ripple CTO Addresses Concerns Behind XRP Ledger Missing Genesis Block, Cites Ethereum Example - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "David Schwartz, the CTO of Ripple, recently addressed concerns surrounding the missing genesis block on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), citing a similar case with Ethereum.\n\nSchwartz made the latest disclosures while responding to questions raised by community member MetaMan regarding the XRP Ledger\u2019s seemingly unusual start at block 32,569.\n\nMetaMan voiced skepticism and emphasized the importance of transparency for XRP holders. \u201cTell me, is there any blockchain that lost its genesis block,\u201d the XRP community member asked Schwartz on X.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSimilar Case with Ethereum\n\nIn response, the Ripple CTO drew a parallel to Ethereum\u2019s genesis block ambiguity. He highlighted that Ethereum, despite having transactions predating its official start, does not publicly document them.\n\nThe choice of what to consider the genesis block is arbitrary. For example, ETH has lots of transactions before its genesis block that are not in the publicly available record. 1/2 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 16, 2024\n\nSchwartz pointed to a specific 2,622 ETH transaction on Aug. 3, 2016, moving over $6 million. He questioned, \u201cWhere did that ETH come from? Where\u2019s the transaction that explains it?\u201d\n\nAn XRP community member referenced transactions showing 40,000 ETH transferred during Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\nSchwartz acknowledged this but stressed that the source of those 40,000 ETH was not publicly visible due to deliberate decisions in defining Ethereum\u2019s genesis block.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSchwartz argued that such decisions, including XRPL\u2019s genesis block starting at ledger 32,569, were arbitrary. He contended that similar choices, like those made in Ethereum\u2019s case, aimed to obscure fund sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 40,000 ETH tokens \u201cjust showed up out of thin air,\u201d the Ripple CTO emphasized that, from the public blockchain perspective, they did. However, he stressed that Ethereum insiders possess more information on the matter.\n\nNonetheless, in the case of the XRP Ledger, being one of the original architects, Schwartz confirmed that the genesis ledger of the chain had no transactions. However, according to him, the first 32,570 ledgers contained 534 transactions, which are presumably lost now.\n\nBefore Schwartz\u2019s response to MetaMan\u2019s initial question, Mayukha Vadari, a Senior Software Developer at RippleX, explained the reason behind the loss of genesis block.\n\nShe noted that the initial set of XRPL servers experienced uniform configuration and simultaneous memory depletion, leading to ledger issues.\n\nSustained Concerns Around the XRPL Genesis Block\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the genesis block\u2019s peculiarity has been questioned. Critics, in the past, raised concerns about the distribution scheme of XRP, suggesting hidden motives behind the absence of earlier ledgers. Schwartz has consistently debunked such notions.\n\nAn XRP holder asked a similar question in the Bitcoin Stack Exchange forum in October 2013, a year after the XRP Ledger went live. He sought to know the reason behind starting the network at block 32,570.\n\nSchwartz responded to this query, noting that a bug affected Ripple servers, causing ledger headers to be lost.\n\nDespite efforts to collect data, insufficient information hindered ledger reconstruction. He reassured the user that the missing ledgers (1 \u2013 32,570) held no significance for average XRPL users.\n\nMoreover, in a post from December 2019, Schwartz provided a broader historical perspective, emphasizing the XRP Ledger\u2019s evolution since its live debut in June 2012. According to him, after the ledger went live, it featured bugs which they had to fix.\n\nSchwartz confirmed that, as a result of some of these bugs and reset exercises carried out on the network, data from the XRP Ledger\u2019s first week, stored in ledgers 1 \u2013 32,570, was lost. However, he assured that they did not recreate the initial 100 billion XRP supply upon the resets."

        "title": "The ETF showdown: Bitcoin\u2019s store of value vs Ethereum\u2019s technological utility - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Over the last few months, the crypto internet has been dominated by the Bitcoin ETF talk. And for a good reason. At a $835.7 billion market cap, the pioneering crypto makes up 49% of the total crypto market, consisting of tens of thousands of tokens.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s 15-year life cycle, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) represents a pivotal divergence, a milestone in legitimacy. Once derided as \u201cfraud\u201d akin to tulip mania, \u201crat poison,\u201d or \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d, Bitcoin\u2019s entry into the ETF arena discards those perception rags and replaces it with a brand new coat.\n\nLong-Term Trickling from a Deep Pool\n\nHaving the blessing of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) means that institutions can start apportioning their capital into a high-yielding asset. Bitcoin fits the bill because, even more so than gold, its supply is affixed, and even though Bitcoin is digital, it is grounded in physicality via the proof-of-work mining network.\n\nAs of October 2023, US ETFs have $5.6 trillion worth of equities. Even in low single-digit percentages, capital trickling into Bitcoin is poised to create a rising tide, a feedback loop owing to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply. Without the hassle of custodianship, investors get exposure to this tide, represented as ETF shares that track Bitcoin\u2019s spot price.\n\nJust one such Bitcoin ETF applicant is BlackRock. The world\u2019s largest asset manager had already lined up capital to the tune of $2 billion, according to sources.\n\nFollowing the approvals on January 11th, an expected sell-pressure transpired in a classic \u201csell the news event,\u201d bringing the BTC price down -7.4% over the week. Yet, launching a new investment vehicle has been successful, tracking over $1.4 billion in AuM and $3.6 billion in volume in just two days.\n\nBut what of Bitcoin\u2019s long-following shadow, Ethereum? Having transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, the Ethereum project is perceived quite differently from Bitcoin. What are these differences and how would they reflect on their respective ETF investment vehicles?\n\nThe Store of Value: Bitcoin in the Spot ETF Market\n\nFor many years, it was not clear what Bitcoin would become. After all, Bitcoin underwent over 100 hard forks, splintering the original whitepaper vision of a \u201cpurely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d.\n\nFollowing the resolution of Bitcoin\u2019s contentious block size wars in 2017, the Small Blockers faction won. Instead of increasing block size outright, they opted for soft Bitcoin scaling via the SegWit upgrade. This veered Bitcoin\u2019s fate into a store-of-value asset instead of a low-friction P2P digital cash.\n\nHard limitations make it impossible to have it both ways. If the large block size faction had won, more computing power and bandwidth would have been required to run full mining nodes, leading to network centralization and potential transaction censorship.\n\nOn the other hand, smaller blocks retain decentralization but make it difficult to scale on-chain. As fewer transactions fit inside a block, higher network activity leads to higher transfer fees because waiting lines are formed. And if BTC transfer fees go up, Bitcoin\u2019s daily currency proposition is diminished.\n\nAt least, without using layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, harnessed by payment apps like Strike. Such payment systems can utilize Bitcoin as a vehicle to transfer cash and interface with the existing banking system.\n\nI use send globally via strike app to bank all the time. It is near instant cash deposit settlement. Our family in the Philippines are in awe of the power of#Bitcoin \u2014 General Plebian (@GenPlebian) December 23, 2023\n\nIn the end, Bitcoin cemented its position as true sovereign money, peer-to-peer but not inherently low friction. Rather, Bitcoin is the foundation for a financial edifice to be built upon. In the age of continuous fiat currency debasement via central banking, decentralized sovereignty overrides low friction, painting Bitcoin as a monetary escape hatch.\n\nFor people accustomed to fiat money erosion, this is a novel concept. Yet, Bitcoin ETF applicants are now incentivized to bring that concept in the public spotlight.\n\nThis competitive marketing push alone is poised to deepen the capital pool for Bitcoin exposure. And the deeper it gets, the higher the Bitcoin price will likely go, creating a feedback loop of more capital inflows.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Technological Utility: Beyond Mere Investment\n\nWhile Bitcoin pioneered the concept of blockchain-based sovereign money, Ethereum is a work-in-progress infrastructure layer. One that onboards digital assets and supplants traditional financial services.\n\nThis purpose drove Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake transition, as such blockchain networks rely on economic stakes instead of energy-hungry computing power. However, having a negligent energy footprint (compared to Bitcoin) is only the scaling starting point.\n\nDaily operational financial infrastructure necessitates low friction (minimal fees) to be accessible and to truly take on TradFi. Ethereum is yet to achieve low friction, relying instead on many layer 2 scaling solutions.\n\nThis became even clearer in the latest roadmap, emphasizing Ethereum interoperability and security against cyber attacks, instead of L1 scaling for low transaction fees.\n\nBy popular demand, an updated roadmap diagram for 2023! pic.twitter.com/oxo58A2KuG \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 30, 2023\n\nThis approach poses two major problems:\n\nBy ditching proof-of-work, the Ethereum blockchain becomes reliant on large stakeholders and cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). This reduces Ethereum\u2019s perception as a decentralized network that could be a true TradFi substitute. In turn, Ethereum positioned itself among other PoS network alternatives, with similar centralization issues But those have been built from the ground up for L1 scaling, without the extra L2 scaling complexity for the end user to interface with.\n\nIn this cycle, this dynamic became more evident. Even though ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it lagged behind Bitcoin at +64% year-over-year performance. Ethereum lagged greatly behind its direct competitors Avalanche (AVAX) at +118% YoY, and Solana (SOL) at +321% YoY performance.\n\nEthereum\u2019s lackluster performance transpired despite having an even lower inflation rate than Bitcoin. This could indicate that Ethereum\u2019s perception is much more precarious than Bitcoin\u2019s, which has a more coherent and focused \u201csound money\u201d proposition.\n\nThat proposition is not duplicatable due to Bitcoin\u2019s mining network effect. For instance, if Bitcoin code were to be tweaked to become a PoS chain, per the preference of Greenpeace, it would simply be a dead code without the network onboarders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s network effect stems from holding dApp domination among PoS chains. Yet, it is not clear if that domination will not shift to AVAX, SOL or another PoS network. Additionally, while it is clear that Bitcoin is viewed as a commodity by regulatory bodies, Ethereum is still in the fog of regulatory obfuscation.\n\nMarket and Regulatory Dynamics\n\nAs of date, SEC Chair Gary Gensler hasn\u2019t explicitly announced whether ETH is a security or a commodity. By the latest speculation, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart thinks that the SEC is leaning in the commodity designation by already approving Ethereum future ETFs in August.\n\nJames Seyffart at CryptoQuant webinar on January 4th:\n\n\u201cSo again, Gary Gensler will not explicitly say whether Ethereum is a security or a commodity, but in their action, by approving those Ethereum futures ETFs, they\u2019re implicitly accepting those Ethereum futures as commodities futures.\u201d\n\nOther PoS chains like SOL, ADA and AVAX are in the same regulatory uncertainty boat. In last year\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC named them all as \u201ccrypto asset securities.\u201d If Seyffart is correct, and ETH becomes a commodity per the preference of CFTC, this could give Ethereum an edge over its competitors.\n\nPresently, spot-traded Ethereum ETFs are delayed until May 2024, from Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF to Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF. Likewise, the SEC pushed back Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, 21Shares and VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF.\n\nGiven the limited market liquidity, compared to the Fed money supply extravaganza in 2021, Bitcoin is poised to be the greater beneficiary of the first move advantage than Ethereum.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a reason why the SEC failed to approve a single spot-traded Bitcoin ETF since the first application by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2013. Not only was Bitcoin less mature, but the banking sector wouldn\u2019t give a leg up to its P2P competition.\n\nSince those days, Bitcoin has overcome its underground, tulip, money laundering detractors. The digital asset is now secured by the world\u2019s most powerful computing network, erecting an ecosystem of mining companies. This further bolstered investor confidence due to Bitcoin\u2019s conservative coding practices.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum is perceived as a more patchworked crypto project yet to entrench itself as a DeFi vanguard to tackle TradFi. Burdened with technical and regulatory uncertainty, conservative Bitcoin is a far likelier candidate to receive sustained retail and institutional attention from the first ETF vehicle.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Liquid restaking providers are building a '10-lane highway' into EigenLayer.\n\nTheir approach evokes liquid staking, the biggest business in Ethereum.\n\nAlthough they offer investors greater rewards, they also come with greater risks.\n\n'Everybody is worried' about a LUNA-style collapse, says one DeFi builder.\n\nA new kind of token is gathering steam on Ethereum.\n\nIt has the potential to turbocharge the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem or leave behind a smouldering ruin if its developers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nThe market capitalisation of liquid restaking tokens, which track the price of Ether, was just over $400 million Tuesday, according to data compiled by Hashed, a 400% increase since mid-December.\n\nOnly three liquid restaking tokens are live: Ether.Fi\u2019s eETH, KelpDAO\u2019s rsETH, and Renzo\u2019s ezETH. But at least eight more are running on test networks and are expected to launch in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThey see \u2018LRT\u2019 and they think it\u2019s the same thing as a liquid staking token,\u201d said Lucas Kozinski, a founding contributor to liquid restaking protocol Renzo, referring to an earlier class of token widely used in DeFi.\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t actually understand the economics of it.\u201d\n\nA \u2018new primitive\u2019\n\nLiquid restaking is often compared to liquid staking, the biggest business on Ethereum. Liquid staking protocols hold more than $32 billion in user deposits, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nTotal investor deposits in liquid staking protocols\n\nStill, the comparison is apt. Both eliminate the opportunity cost that comes with \u201cstaking,\u201d locking away one\u2019s tokens to secure Ethereum in exchange for a modest annual yield.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThat yield is often lower than the return investors can earn elsewhere in DeFi, for example by lending their tokens.\n\nLiquid staking and restaking protocols address the opportunity cost by issuing IOUs for staked tokens.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why restaking actually makes a lot of sense, because, well, you should let people get further out on the risk curve.\u2019 \u2014 Mike Silagadze, EtherFi\n\nThose IOUs \u2014 known as liquid staking or liquid restaking tokens \u2014 can then be used across DeFi as if they were the staked tokens, a win-win for Ethereum and for users leery of locking away tokens when there are more lucrative ways to use them.\n\nThat\u2019s where the similarity ends.\n\nLiquid staking tokens, such as Lido\u2019s stETH or Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH, have relatively few risks \u2014 at least when compared to most other DeFi protocols with complex smart contracts. All told, there are relatively few machines, people or lines of code needed.\n\nA user entrusts their Ether to individuals and organisations called node operators, who, in turn, run so-called validator software to participate in the confirmation of pending transactions on Ethereum.\n\nIf an incompetent or malicious node operator misbehaves, some of the Ether is destroyed in a process called \u201cslashing.\u201d This is rare, however: only 1 Ether has been slashed since the current iteration of Ethereum launched, according to Rated.\n\nRisk curve\n\nSome foresee a future in which all Ether is locked away generating its modest yield, replaced in the marketplace by IOUs in the form of stETH and its competitors.\n\nThe relative safety of staking is reflected in that yield: just under 4% last Friday, a number that will drop as more Ether is staked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why restaking actually makes a lot of sense, because, well, you should let people get further out on the risk curve,\u201d Mike Silagadze, of liquid restaking provider Ether.Fi, told DL News.\n\n\u201cWhat if you\u2019re okay taking a 1% risk [of slashing] in exchange for much higher rewards?\u201d\n\nLiquid restaking tokens are expected to increase in number this year. They use the EigenLayer protocol to help bootstrap any number of other protocols, each with its own level of security. Investors earn Ethereum staking yields as well as yield from bootstrapping a basket of other protocols that use EigenLayer.\n\nThe next \u2018Luna catastrophe\u2019?\n\nThe safety \u2014 and the outsize yield \u2014 of liquid restaking tokens will be determined by how well liquid restaking providers manage the basket of protocols they validate.\n\n\u201cOn Ethereum mainnet, the marketplace for liquid staking is structurally very different [than for liquid restaking], because there\u2019s only one strategy you could run,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019ll end the bull [market] when a Luna catastrophe happens, because no one cares about risk management.\u2019 \u2014 Tze Donn Ng\n\n\u201cBut when you have all the different strategies that you could run [with liquid restaking] \u2026 it\u2019s actually a brand-new DeFi primitive that doesn\u2019t exist, and that\u2019s portfolio management.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is convinced this is a positive development.\n\nRestaking will kickstart the next bull market because of its high APYs and novel technology, Tze Donn Ng, an investment associate at venture capital firm Tioga Capital, told DL News.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019ll end the bull [market] when a Luna catastrophe happens, because no one cares about risk management,\u201d he added.\n\nAttractive, but unsustainable, yields available on the Terra/Luna blockchain drew investors during the 2021 run that saw most major cryptocurrencies hit all-time highs. Terra\u2019s collapse in May 2022 helped plunge the crypto economy into a deep freeze.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s worried about that,\u201d Kozinski said when asked about the Terra analogy.\n\nEigenLayer\n\nWhen EigenLayer launched in June, it became the first protocol to offer \u201crestaking.\u201d\n\nRestaking allows users to stake Ether or their staked Ether \u2014 not to secure Ethereum, but to bootstrap protocols that would otherwise have to run on their own networks, such as the bridges that allow users to transfer tokens between blockchains.\n\nTotal investor deposits in EigenLayer\n\nIn exchange, the protocols that use EigenLayer pay restakers, boosting the safe but modest yields people can earn from old-fashioned staking.\n\nSubchains and L2s\n\nProponents say this will dramatically reduce the cost of some protocols, including bridges, other blockchains, oracles, and diverse technologies critical to the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI believe that in the next two years we are going to see more non-crypto businesses onboard into web3,\u201d Dheeraj Borra, from liquid staking protocol Stader, said in an X Spaces appearance last year.\n\n\u201cRestaking is going to be a great platform for them to create subchains and L2s, with most [liquid staking tokens] becoming active collateral for these chains.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, warn it\u2019s a business model that could cause systemic risk if providers aren\u2019t careful.\n\nEither way, liquid restaking providers are trying to usher in this future.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re trying to build a 10-lane highway to make it super convenient and efficient for that capital to flow in and out of EigenLayer,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\nAs the market matures, observers predict liquid restaking tokens will integrate with the broader DeFi ecosystem and be used as collateral to borrow other crypto, mint stablecoins, and more.\n\nRisk management\n\nWhether that happens will depend on risk management.\n\nChunda McCain, founder of Ion Protocol, a lending platform for restaked assets, also likens liquid restaking providers to portfolio managers, or platforms for portfolio managers. Ion, whose test network launched last week, is attempting to develop tools to analyse liquid restaking providers\u2019 risk profiles.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to build a lending protocol,\u2019\u201d McCain told DL News. \u201cAnd then I realized, \u2018Wait, in order to build a lending protocol, you need to do all the underwriting.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe returns from restaking will flow from the protocols that use EigenLayer, which EigenLayer calls actively validated services, or AVSs.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re effectively putting all of that trust into whoever\u2019s running the strategy of the LRT provider.\u2019 \u2014 Chunda McCain\n\nLiquid restaking providers will have to become expert at assessing the risk of various AVSs. And the variety of investment strategies is almost endless.\n\nWith three AVSs, restakers are presented with seven possible investment strategies. Fifteen AVSs provide more than 30,000 possible strategies. Liquid restaking providers must price risk appropriately to ensure their users are not left holding the bag if an AVS goes under.\n\n\u201cThe goal of an LRT is to say, \u2018OK, I understand the profit potential of all these different platforms. \u2026 [and] to make sure I can offer the users who want to participate in the restaking ecosystem maximal returns with minimised risk,\u201d McCain said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re effectively putting all of that trust into whoever\u2019s running the strategy of the LRT provider.\u201d\n\nRestaking stack\n\nHe said he worries that an irresponsible liquid restaking provider will offer users massive yields despite poor risk management, attracting so much money it will become a systemic risk.\n\n\u201cSomeone will most likely build this,\u201d he said.\n\nRisk can come from every layer of the liquid restaking stack.\n\nBecause restaking yield comes, in part, from tokens issued by AVSs, restakers can be harmed if an AVS introduces poor tokenomics.\n\n\u2018Leverage on top of leverage\u2019\n\nRisk can come from node operators that get slashed. And it can come from newer DeFi protocols that allow people to lend and borrow or mint stablecoins against LRTs.\n\nAdditionally, risk can come from old-fashioned bugs in liquid restaking protocols\u2019 smart contracts. Earlier this year, liquid restaking protocol Astrid was hacked and has been paused since.\n\nBut providers can learn from DeFi lending protocols, according to Kozinski. Liquid staking and liquid restaking protocols are essentially lending protocols, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is leverage on top of leverage on top of leverage on top of leverage on top of leverage.\u201d\n\nIf they succeed at managing risk, they could become some of the most popular tokens on Ethereum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think liquid restaking is another category. I think liquid restaking is just going to become table stakes for liquid staking,\u201d Silagadze said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to have pure, vanilla liquid staking tokens even, like, two years from now.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Jan 17: This article was updated to correct a comment from Lucas Kozinski regarding lending protocols.\n\nAleks Gilbert is DL News\u2019 New York DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "Larry Fink of BlackRock backs an Ethereum ETF, potentially heralding a transformative era for investors in the realm of tokenization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s steady growth amidst the ETF buzz contrasts Bitcoin\u2019s performance, underscoring its appeal in the evolving cryptocurrency ETF landscape.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), has recently shown support for an Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move came just a day after the launch of the much-anticipated Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. Earlier reports from CNF had already hinted at this development, noting Fink\u2019s endorsement of an Ethereum ETF as a pivotal moment in the journey towards tokenization.\n\nEthereum\u2019s remarkable growth, in contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuating value, underscores the market\u2019s strong anticipation for an Ethereum ETF.\n\nIn a CNBC interview, shared by community member Cryptik1E, Fink remarked,\n\nThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization, and I firmly believe that this is the direction we are heading.\n\nHe further distinguished cryptocurrencies, not as traditional currencies, but as a unique asset class. He specifically referred to Bitcoin as an asset class that offers protection amidst geopolitical risks.\n\nAdditionally, a report from Yahoo Finance shed light on the debut of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the U.S., alongside other Bitcoin ETFs. This followed the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval, with IBIT accounting for a notable portion of the total trading volume experienced by these ETFs.\n\nFink\u2019s support for an Ether ETF aligns with BlackRock\u2019s intention to introduce a similar product for Ethereum\u2019s native token. This strategy fits into the company\u2019s broader vision of embracing tokenization, which involves converting real-world or digital assets into blockchain tokens. As of this article\u2019s writing, Ethereum trades at $2,542.91, showing a 0.25%increase in the last day and a 6.68% increase over the past week."

        "content": "Over 200 wallets have lost funds after interacting with crypto bridge aggregator Bungee.\n\nThose who previously sent tokens via the bridge's Socket protocol route on Ethereum were affected.\n\nA bug in the underlying technology that powers parts of crypto bridge aggregator Bungee has just cost its users a combined $3.3 million.\n\nAt approximately 8:11 pm London time on Tuesday, over 200 wallets that had previously used Bungee\u2019s Socket route to send tokens on Ethereum began to see their funds drained from them.\n\nTayler Melvin, team hospitality lead at Socket, said in the Socket Discord server the project had \u201cexperienced a security incident which affected wallets with infinite approvals to Socket contracts.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of the stolen tokens \u2014 over $2.9 million \u2014 were converted into Ether. Smaller amounts of Polygon\u2019s Matic token, wrapped versions of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and MakerDAO\u2019s Dai stablecoin remain in the hacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nAfter noticing the attack, Socket, the project that manages the Bungee bridge\u2019s underlying technology, paused the smart contract that was being exploited.\n\n\u201cWhomever responsible can no longer do any further damage, we\u2019ve paused everything,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nSocket is an interoperability protocol that allows data and asset transfers across chains.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Surges After Spot ETF Approval - Is Ethereum Next? Presale Madness for Pullix - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "Recently, Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a meteoric surge following the approval of a Spot ETF. Meanwhile, analysts claim that Ethereum (ETH) is next for this event. Adding to the excitement, the Pullix (PLX) presale has ignited a frenzy, raising over $3.6M and reaching Stage 6. Some experts even hint that PLX could become the next 100x altcoin in 2024 - let\u2019s see why.\n\nBitcoin ETF News\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has made headlines as the SEC approved all Bitcoin ETFs. This landmark approval sent Bitcoin on an upward trajectory, reaching $47,600. With this development, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency has jumped 10% on the monthly charts, soaring from $41,790 on December 12 to $46,648 on January 11.\n\nThe technical analysis of this top 5 cryptocurrency paints a bullish picture as 27 technical indicators are in the green. Moreover, its Fear & Greed index rating is 76 (Extreme Greed) - a good bullish sign. Because of these circumstances, experts predict that Bitcoin may trade at the $65,341 level by the end of 2024.\n\nHow High Will Ethereum Go?\n\nMeanwhile, market analyst Will Clemente announced the next deadline for the Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Per him, May 23 is the final deadline for Van Eck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF approval. After this news, the Ethereum price increased from $2,408 on January 10 to $2,636 on January 11.\n\nSentiment around this altcoin is bullish, with 28 technical indicators flashing green. Additionally, the Ethereum cryptocurrency trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. All these factors have made market analysts make a bullish Ethereum price prediction. They foresee a potential surge to $2,832 for Ethereum by the end of February 2024.\n\nPullix (PLX): On the Top ICO List\n\nPullix (PLX) has also made headlines as it recently entered Stage 6 of its presale. Pullix aims to challenge the status quo by creating a hybrid trading platform. This exchange will combine the best features of both CEX and DEX in one place. Therefore, you can expect deep liquidity, access to all asset classes (including cryptos) and high leverage at 1000:1 on Pullix.\n\nThe PLX native token is the backbone of this platform and will be the main currency used to make trades. One exciting aspect is its \u201cTrade-to-Earn\u201d model, which has caused global investors to stockpile this token. To clarify, Pullix will reward PLX stakers by giving them a percentage of the exchange\u2019s daily revenue.\n\nThis passive income capability and holding perks like reduced trading fees have helped sell 4.6M PLX tokens so far. One PLX token is worth $0.08 - a 100% ROI for those who bought it early on. Thanks to its ties to the forex market, which Baby Pips claims is the biggest, experts predict a 100x surge for PLX after it hits exchanges in Q1 of 2024.\n\nCan Pullix Outshine Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nLooking at all three of these cryptos, it is clear that Pullix has one distinct advantage. It has a low market cap of $16M, while Bitcoin and Ethereum have $917B and $316B, respectively. This means PLX would only need $16M for its current price (and returns) to double. On the other hand, BTC and ETH may find it difficult to rise to new heights. For this reason, Pullix looks to be the best crypto to invest in.\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Communities"

        "content": "The brief dip in Bitcoin to $42k was influenced by a combination of factors. Fluctuations in market sentiment, often triggered by news events or regulatory developments, can play a role. According to an article by Economic Times, the price of Bitcoin dropped after the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started trading in the US. Some analysts believe that the recent hype surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may have cooled down, and that the market is now waiting to see whether it can sustain upward momentum."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has reached yet another remarkable achievement, dominating decentralized finances (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) by 80%. Meanwhile, its native token, Ether, aims at the $3,000 price zone, threatening a short squeeze soon.\n\nRemarkably, the total value locked on Ethereum\u2019s first layer surged 231% in the last 24 hours to $100.31 billion. This sums up to recent increases, resulting in 255% and 283% changes in the last seven and 30 days, respectively.\n\nTotal value locked on the top 5 DeFi chains. Source: DefiLlama\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the above data, retrieved by Finbold from DefiLlama, does not include Ethereum\u2019s second layers. For example, Arbitrum (ARB) has its own $2.62 billion in total value locked, ranking fourth among the DeFi chains.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 80% dominance on DeFi by total value locked\n\nInterestingly, Tron (TRX) holds the second place with over 13 times less TVL than Ethereum, with $8.063 billion.\n\nIn this context, Ethereum layer-1 now dominates the DeFi ecosystem with an impressive 80.62% TVL dominance. Tron gets a share of 6.23%, mostly on stablecoins, while BNB Chain (BNB) and Arbitrum have over 2%. Solana (SOL) is the fifth most valuable DeFi chain with a $1.34 billion TVL and a 1.04% dominance.\n\nPie chart: Total value locked in all chains. Source: DefiLlama\n\nEthereum\u2019s total value locked is distributed among 1004 DeFi protocols, contributing to its ecosystem.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, ETH is trading at $2,554 per token by press time, slightly up 2% in the last 24 hours. Ether reached $2,714, its highest price of 2024, so far. On the other hand, $2,140 was the lowest for the first month of the year.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nEthereum has around $307.09 billion of market capitalization at these prices. This is three times more than its DeFi ecosystem has in total value locked, evidencing how meaningful its dominance is among other chains.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nThe founder of the decentralised mining network and software development platform Ethereum Vitalik Buterin shared his insights about Ethereum layer 2 of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVitalik shared pivotal points regarding L2 networks which are considered as main scalability tool for the Ethereum Network.\n\nDebate About L2 Layer\n\nThe L2 layer on the Ethereum blockchain is a collective term for an Ethereum scaling solution that manages transactions off Ethereum layer 1 while still taking benefit of the robust decentralized security of Ethereum layer 1. Layer 2 is a different blockchain that extends Ethereum.\n\nL2 solution is designed to improve transaction capacity and pace without compromising on the security which is facilitated by the main chain layer1. This proves to be beneficial for the users as it helps users to understand the types of solutions available for their respective issues.\n\nVitalik engaged in a debate which was about \u201cL2s\u201d encompassing both rollups and validiums. The users need to understand the different security features where rollups are \u201csecurity-favoring\u201d solutions that bundle or \u201croll up\u201d transactions into a single proof, which is posted to the main chain. This methodology enables high security, as the L1 blockchain instantly secures them.\n\nComparatively, rollups are a bit expensive due to their ability to its data on-chain which provides higher security on the other hand Validiums provide an inexpensive alternate option to rollups. The founder of Ethereum Vitalik has suggested that terminology should reflect these distinctions without delegitimizing either option. In the spectrum of L2 solutions, he suggests terms like \u201cstrong L2\u201d for rollups and \u201clight L2\u201d for validiums to enable users to guide their choices better.\n\nVitalik also cleared that the whole process of L2 solution is not only about security as both rollups and Validiums have \u201cintermediate space\u201d."
