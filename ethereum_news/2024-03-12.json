        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s fix for its gas fee problem is now live: What you need to know about the Dencun upgrade - Fortune",
        "content": "On Wednesday morning, the Ethereum blockchain completed an upgrade called Dencun, the biggest change to the network\u2019s code in over a year. The upgrade is an important step to help the world\u2019s second-most valuable blockchain overcome its scaling challenges, and reduce its infamous gas fees. But what exactly is Dencun and how does it work? Our plain-English explainer tells all you need to know.\n\nWhat is the Dencun upgrade?\n\nDencun describes two upgrades that took place at the same time on Ethereum. The name combines the \u201cCancun\u201d upgrade of the execution layer and the \u201cDeneb\u201d upgrade on the consensus layer. The latter refers to how network users agree on the state of the blockchain, while the former refers to how transactions are processed.\n\nIn technical terms, the upgrade is the result of a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d or EIP-4844, which improves the blockchain\u2019s propensity to handle data from secondary networks.\n\nGathering of the five families in London for the Dencun upgrade pic.twitter.com/4cyxFSQoVh \u2014 David Mihal.eth (@dmihal) March 13, 2024\n\nWhy did Dencun come about in the first place?\n\nThe upgrade will lower gas fees for the growing number of networks built on top of Ethereum that are known as Layer 2 (L2), or \u201croll-ups.\u201d This is important since gas fees have historically soared whenever there is a surge of activity on the blockchain, making it unviable to use at a large scale. Roll-ups help address this by processing transactions separately, and then stamping them to the main Ethereum blockchain in batches.\n\nWhile roll-ups have already made Ethereum more efficient, one issue that is that, post-compression, nodes processing transactions hold on to L2 data infinitely, requiring a greater volume of hardware as time goes on. This has meant that over 90% of the fees on roll-ups are used for this data storage.\n\nThe upgrade means L2 data will be added to the base Ethereum network via fleeting, more efficient \u201cblobs\u201d rather than data held indefinitely. Instead, \u201cblob data\u201d will be stored for 18 days.\n\nWhat about the main Ethereum network?\n\nThe overall effect should be lower costs, but users on the main blockchain (L1) won\u2019t enjoy these lower fees until at least 2026\u20132027, says Pitchbook\u2019s crypto analyst Robert Le, until there is \u201cfull danksharding,\u201d referring to a roll-up scaling method which provides extra storage for increased transactional capacity.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, you\u2019ll see less and less individual users, whether retail or businesses, transact directly on Ethereum. More will move to L2s and the only ones transacting on Ethereum will be the rollups,\u201d he said.\n\nEIP-4844 marks the beginning of the \u201cSurge\u201d phase for Ethereum, outlined by the network\u2019s cofounder Vitalik Buterin in December. The aim of this phase is to reach 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nHow much will Dencun lower fees?\n\nGas fees had risen to an average of 98 gwei (a denomination worth one-billionth of an Ether, the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain) the week before the upgrade, a level not seen since early May 2023, according to Ethercan data. A swap would cost users $87.45 in gas fees on average, while non-fungible token (NFT) sales average $147 in gas.\n\nAfter the Ethereum Dencun upgrade this week, EIP-4844 will reduce L2 gas fees. According to IntoTheBlock statistics, for a DEX swap, the gas fee for Aribitrum will be reduced from $2.02 to $0.4, Optimism will be reduced from $1.42 to $0.28, Base will be reduced from $0.58 to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/0x6jGDYF5z \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2024\n\nL2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. Swapping tokens on decentralized exchanges, which currently costs $1\u2013$2, should fall to around 10\u201320 cents, and could even go as low as a fraction of a cent.\n\nWhat does Dencun mean for the price of Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) has climbed over 150% since October. Last week it broke $4,000, for the second time ever, where it has hovered since, indicating it could soon pass its all-time high of $4,878.26, reached in November 2021.\n\nThe price surge is part of a broader bull crypto bull market spurred by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January, and optimism that regulators will approve Ethereum ETFs, too, this year. But experts told Fortune they foresee the upgrade having a continued, positive impact on ETH\u2019s price that could be more significant than ETFs, as investors bet on the network\u2019s development potential.\n\nIt will be an \u201cabsolute game changer\u201d for the token, and is the \u201cbigger story right now,\u201d Matt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s CIO, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cThere are a billion applications you can build if transactions are below a penny that you can\u2019t build if they range from 10 to 50 cents,\u201d said Hougan. \u201cOnce we get them reliably free to people, you will see financial applications, DeFi and NFTs, but you will also see nonfinancial applications. I think we\u2019re gonna see this massive explosion of mainstream uses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a new type of technology, a new type of platform. I think that\u2019s what ETH has going for it on the sentiment side, and why it\u2019s doing so well,\u201d Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, added."

        "title": "Ethereum Completes Milestone Dencun Upgrade, Which Should Substantially Reduce Fees - Unchained",
        "content": "Layer 2 blockchain networks can now use a different way to store data, which is intended to help these rollups scale the Ethereum blockchain network that was plagued by huge spikes in gas fees in years prior.\n\nEthereum has completed a significant upgrade of its blockchain network, which is expected to pave the way for the next generation of crypto users to transact onchain without suffering significant spikes in gas fees.\n\nThe upgrade, named \u201cDencun,\u201d was completed early morning Wednesday ET after it was activated on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet at epoch height of 269568, according to Ethereum developers in a live stream on YouTube. At one point, more than 3,600 people were watching the official rollout of Dencun on the livestream.\n\n\u201cWe basically enter this new era of Ethereum scalability,\u201d said Anthony Sassano, the creator of Ethereum-focused media site The Daily Gwei, referring to how Dencun implements EIP-4844 and \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which creates a highly optimized and much cheaper storage space where rollups can post data to called \u201cblobspace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first step on a long journey that has been going on for a few years now towards what we [Ethereum contributors] call full danksharding, which will greatly increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability properties specifically for layer 2s,\u201d Sassano added.\n\nRead more: How Much Will the Dencun Upgrade Really Reduce Ethereum Layer 2 Fees By?\n\nDencun is Ethereum\u2019s most substantial software change since Shapella, which occurred about 10 months ago. Before the hard fork upgrade, rollups had to store information such as transaction history in calldata, which is \u201creally expensive, because Ethereum calldata has to be stored forever,\u201d said Polygon\u2019s vice president of product, David Silverman, in an interview with Unchained.\n\nAfter the upgrade, when rollups post data to this new blobspace in the form of \u201cblobs,\u201d the information isn\u2019t stored forever and so it\u2019s much cheaper, while still providing similar security guarantees. Consequently, \u201crollups can generally pass those cost [savings] on along to their users,\u201d lowering transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 networks, Silverman added.\n\nThis impact could occur immediately or more gradually over time. The various L2s will go through their respective governance processes to change the target of where they\u2019re posting data from either calldata to blobspace or possibly a mix of the two. This means some networks may see changes immediately on day one, while others may take as long as a month-and-a-half, depending on when their governance votes are held and how easy it is for a rollup to integrate the upgrade, noted Silverman.\n\nFor example, the team for the layer 2 blockchain network Base, which was incubated by crypto exchange Coinbase, said in a blog post that Base will have support for the Dencun upgrade on the first day.\n\nAnother Ethereum rollup, zkSync, is already ready to submit blob transactions, per Daniel Lumi, senior product manager at Matter Labs, the software firm building zkSync, adding that zkSync has a solution for where the protocol decides to post data.\n\nGetting Lucky\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comes as the price of Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ETH, is trading around $4,000, a level not seen since the end of 2021 before Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Ethereum developers don\u2019t implement upgrades based on market pressure, the Dencun upgrade implementation coinciding with the start of an early bull market and ETH trading around the $4,000 level is \u201clucky,\u201d Silverman noted.\n\nThe DeFi Summer in 2020 ended in part because Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure was not ready to accommodate the mass of new users coming onchain, which became evident when gas prices to execute a token swap on a decentralized exchange soared to hundreds of dollars.\n\nAs a result of Dencun and specifically EIP-4844, which will bring transaction costs down, \u201cwe now have a ton more capacity from all these rollups to handle this next generation of users without gas prices spiking up to $200 [or] $300 per swap, killing our momentum,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cWe got lucky in the sense that we got this [the Dencun upgrade] out of the way before retail is coming back.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Resistance at $4K, Yet Current Data Favours Bulls - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Ethereum Faces Resistance at $4K, Yet Current Data Favours Bulls\n\nEthereum has become a symbol of innovation in the blockchain space attracting many innovators to develop their crypto projects on it. As a result, there are many decentralized applications on the blockchain.\n\nAlso, Ethereum is the second largest blockchain and the biggest altcoin project. That is a reason why the crypto market anticipates the United States SEC will approve spot Ethereum ETFs in the near future. This analysis will cover the recent ETH price movement and its future catalysts.\n\nETH Recent Gains Tied to Decreasing Supply and Staking Demand, DeFi Popularity and Proof \u2013 of \u2013 stake Burn Mechanism\n\nOn February 25th Ethereum broke above the $3,000 price level, a critical resistance zone, and has moved steadily up since. On the 11th of March ETH hit $4000, before sliding back slightly on the 12th. Current data suggests that ETH has the potential to trend above the $4,000 level and possibly enter a major bull run.\n\n\n\nConfidence that the ETH price will surpass the $4,000 level and enter an ETH bull run is drawn from several factors including the decrease in Ethereum supply, being driven by the demand for staking. The ETH supply may shrink as a result of the network\u2019s proof-of-stake burn mechanism. Once ETH rises above $4,000 it may get strong resistance at $4,065, $4,185, $4,220, and then $4,300.\n\n\n\nMany ETH enthusiasts anticipate that an Ethereum season will come in the near future. As a result, some Ethereum investors are holding onto ETH anticipating a higher price at the right time, considering that there are several expected upgrades on the blockchain that may increase the coin\u2019s demand.\n\nAs the screenshot indicates, Ryan S Adams, a crypto analyst and enthusiast, expects the ETH demand and price to rise as a result of staking and restaking of the coin. The expansion of the DeFi ecosystem based on the Ethereum network will also likely increase the demand for ETH which may contribute to a possible Ethereum price surge. Once the Ethereum price surges above $4,000 the market anticipates it will break above the $4,300 resistance level, positioning itself for the next Ether bull run.\n\nEthereum Price Catalysts as we Move Beyond the Dencun Upgrade\n\nThere are several factors that are likely to affect the Ethereum price in 2024, including an increase in staking, the Dencun Upgrade, ETH ETFs and a decrease in its supply. The Bitcoin halving may also affect the ETH price due to their correlation.\n\nDecrease in Ethereum Supply: During a 30-day period that ended on 24 February the Ethereum circulating supply decreased by 18,960 ETH while beginning from 15 February there has been a preference for net withdrawals. The next diagram gives a summary of Net ETH transfers to exchanges, indicating a rise in selling pressure.\n\nUsually, the net transfers to exchanges increase when the Ethereum holders aim to sell their coins. Nonetheless, the fact that the Ether price remained stable around $2,300 indicates that the rise in Ethereum sales was not related to a price rally.\n\nThe SEC Approval of Spot ETH ETFs May Trigger An Ethereum Price Surge: We have noted that the SEC\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF approval in January has increased the demand for bitcoin. For example, the BTC ETF issuers like BlackRock have acquired much bitcoin in a short period. The market anticipates a similar effect on the demand for ETH if the SEC approves the ETFs.\n\nThe approval of the spot ETH ETFs will likely trigger an Ethereum price rally and a possible ETH bull run. Currently, many crypto analysts have said that there is a 50% chance of SEC approval of the ETFs. For example, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an investment analyst at JPMorgan, told TheBlock that there is a 50% possibility of the SEC\u2019s approval of ETH ETFs. The earliest expected date for the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is 23 May.\n\nIncrease in Ethereum Future Premium: The market usually uses changes in the price of ETH futures to gauge ETH\u2019s possible future trend. In a neutral ETH market the Ethereum futures often trade at a premium of between 5% and 10%. Significantly, a premium of more than 10% shows that the demand for the coin may increase or remain high which influences the price of the underlying asset to rise. However, in the case of Ethereum the premium is stuck above 14% indicating a high demand for ETH.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade: A number of upgrades lined up for the Ethereum blockchain like the recent Dencun one may also push the ETH price up. Dencun, the Ethereum protocol upgrade, launched on 13 March, and will bring significant benefits to the blockchain such as the reduction in transaction fees.\n\nRise in Decentralized Finance on Ethereum: Several crypto projects have launched decentralized finance protocols on the Ethereum blockchain which may increase the demand for ETH. For instance, there has been a rise in liquid staking tokens (LRTs) on the blockchain. Ether.FI and Puffer are examples of DeFi platforms that have introduced high-yield liquid staking tokens (LRTs). Interestingly, some of the recently introduced DeFi protocols have been offering airdrops to the Ethereum community. As an example, Starknet, an Ethereum rollup, recently introduced STRK airdrop which has helped to increase the demand for ETH. These factors, among others, may help drive Ethereum season.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s all time high was $4706 \u2013 achieved in November 2021. Currently, the $4,000 Ethereum price level is providing some resistance forcing the value of ETH to remain below it for now. Nonetheless, there are various factors that can help to catapult the price of ETH higher. The decrease in its circulating supply, ETH restaking, the Dencun upgrade and the rise in DeFi on the Ethereum blockchain may lead to an increase in the value of the coin \u2013 and a potential new all time high in the coming months."

That\u2019s up from 31% in mid-February.\n\nYet bettors and analysts are putting slim chances of a Securities and Exchange Commission approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe deadline for an SEC decision on VanEck\u2019s application is on May 23.\n\nBettors on Polymarket give a spot Ethereum ETF a 31% chance of being approved, down from 82% at the beginning of January.\n\n\u201cI get all the reasons they should approve it \u2014 and we personally believe they should \u2014 but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish [two and a half months] out for Bitcoin spot are not there this time,\u201d Eric Balchunas said in a post on X.\n\nHe and his fellow Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart revised their approval odds to 35% on Monday, down from 70% in February.\n\nThe hope is that if and when spot Ethereum ETFs are approved, they will give the asset a similar growth as Bitcoin had on the back of ETFs in January.\n\nThe news comes as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $71,000 on Monday, with many wondering if Ethereum will follow suit.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEthereum surged to a yearly high above $4,070 on Monday and is up more than 60% over the last 30 days.\n\nEthereum reached a record $4,878 in November 2021.\n\nAnalysts have identified several key factors that could super-charge it to new peaks.\n\nThey include broad optimism, supply-side dynamics, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nSupply constraints\n\nAnother Ethereum tailwind: its shrinking supply due to tokens being locked up for staking, Pratik Kala, senior digital asset investment analyst at crypto fund manager DigitalX, told DL News on Monday.\n\n\u201cLess supply to go around is always bullish,\u201d Pratik said. \u201cThis also indicates strong long-term investor demand to buy/hold/stake ETH versus using it for short-term speculation.\u201d\n\nStaking in Ethereum parallels Bitcoin mining by generating additional tokens, verifying transactions, and safeguarding the blockchain.\n\nLocking up tokens for staking effectively means removed them from the circulating supply, which can lead to a decrease in the overall available supply.\n\nRoughly 26% of Ethereum\u2019s estimated circulating supply of more than 120 million tokens are locked away, according to blockchain explorer beaconcha.in.\n\nDencun upgrade\n\nInvestment bank JPMorgan and spot Bitcoin ETF provider Grayscale are among those that have identified the Dencun upgrade as a catalyst for Ethereum.\n\nThe upgrade, due Wednesday UK time, is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 platforms.\n\n\u201cWith layer 2 solutions built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain is becoming the settlement layer for a whole new digital infrastructure encompassing gaming, trading, and investing,\u201d Eugene Cheung, Bybit\u2019s head of institutions, told DL News earlier in March.\n\n\u201cThe value of all of this will tend to accrue to the ETH asset.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous headline misstated the Polymarket odds of an Ethereum record at 56%.

        "title": "What Is Ethereum Triple Halving? - LCX",
        "content": "The Ethereum Merge upgrades, which marked the transition from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) paradigm, are a significant turning point in the development of Ethereum. The aforementioned transition has led to the emergence of the phrase \u2018Ethereum Triple Halving,\u2019 which has piqued the interest of traders, investors, and industry professionals who are anxious to comprehend its possible ramifications on ETH transaction fees and prices.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Triple Halving\n\nThe Ethereum Triple Halving refers to a procedure wherein the block incentive for ETH is decreased from three (3) ETH to one (1) ETH per block. This decrease in frequency takes place around every four to six years and functions to mitigate inflationary pressures on the Ethereum network, ultimately contributing to the augmentation of the ETH\u2019s long-term value.\n\nThe moniker \u201cTriple Halving\u201d is derived from the Bitcoin halving phenomenon, which entails a halving of mining rewards for Bitcoin every four years. Although conceptually similar, the Triple Halving implemented on Ethereum transpires on a significantly grander magnitude. This is accomplished through the reduction of rewards that miners obtain for each successful validation of a transaction block. When new currencies are minted, Ethereum miners are awarded tokens, similar to how Bitcoin is halved. In addition, transaction fees are allocated to miners in recognition of each block that is mined effectively on Ethereum.\n\nBriefly, the event is referred to as the \u201cEthereum Triple Halving\u201d because of the following:\n\nAt the moment, the default fee percentage stands at 12.5%, which signifies that 12.5% of the petrol fees are incinerated. However, there are intentions to increase this to 25% by means of the forthcoming Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, which is scheduled for March 2023.\n\nAdditionally, an imminent enhancement known as Surge is anticipated to be implemented. As a result, the basic fee percentage will once more increase to 50%.\n\nThese two enhancements will collectively reduce the rate of new Ether issuance by approximately 90%, which is equivalent to three consecutive halvings. This contributes to the term \u201ctriple halving\u201d being applied."

Dencun ships a total of 9 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in all, making it tied for the largest single hard fork in terms of improvements shipped, according to Tim Beiko, who coordinates the Ethereum core developer calls, on the Ethereum Foundation livestream commemorating the event.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposals to watch in 2024\n\nPost-Dencun, most rollups and their users will see benefits within hours to days, as the availability of data blobs on Ethereum \u2014 introduced by EIP-4844 \u2014 should slash transaction fees by 5-10x.\n\nThis real-world benefit to users is primarily driving anticipation for the upgrade, according to Hannes Graah, a builder of crypto wallet Zeal.\n\n\u201cThe Dencun upgrade brings us closer to a future where fees are an afterthought, not a dealbreaker,\u201d Graah told Blockworks. \u201cJust as we generally don\u2019t worry about the cost of traditional domestic bank transfers, Web3 users should be able to transact without worrying about fees.\u201d\n\nAki Balogh, co-founder and CEO of DLC.Link, likens EIP-4844 to the \u201cNoSQL movement of the 2010s,\u201d which removed constraints of structured SQL data, through developments like MongoDB.\n\n\u201cGiving developers large blobs of temporary data (deleted after 30 days) provides them the opportunity to innovate while not increasing load on the network,\u201d Balogh told Blockworks, removing a major Ethereum bottleneck. \u201cSimilar to Mongo\u2019s effect, this proposal will help innovation as dApps and chains find new ways to use the temp storage space,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast to scaling in Web2, this new data storage channel for Ethereum doesn\u2019t sacrifice decentralization, notes Philippe Schommers, head of infrastructure at Gnosis, which implemented Dencun already on Monday.\n\nRead more: Gnosis Chain premieres Ethereum\u2019s Dencun hard fork\n\n\u201cWhen working towards scalability solutions on the blockchain, there are choices that developers have to make to prioritize decentralization,\u201d Schommers told Blockworks. \u201cWhen you look at Web2 infrastructure, it\u2019s easy to see how centralized scalability can be done, but that\u2019s not the path we\u2019re trying to follow.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cless glamorous\u201d Schommers said, it was part of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cbig ambition,\u201d calling Dencun \u201cone piece of the puzzle that gets us a little bit closer to building a larger scale, fully decentralized network.\u201d\n\nOthers are more effusive.\n\nLucas Henning, chief technology officer of Suku, says it\u2019s still early days and the upgrade \u201cwill guide the Ethereum ecosystem towards a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for Ethereum, and I am keen to see the effects of these changes on the decentralized world landscape,\u201d Henning said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, president of StarkWare. \u201cToday will go down as the date of birth for a dapp-for-everything culture.\u201d\n\nUpdated March 13, 2024 at 11:30 am ET, clarifying Dencun is equal to one earlier fork for the most number of EIPs included.\n\nCorrection March 13, 2024 at 1:40 pm ET: Misattribution of one quote.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "What You Need To Know Ahead of Ethereum's Dencun Update Wednesday - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Ethereum's next major network update, known as \"Dencun,\" is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nDencun is expected to lower transaction fees on the many Layer 2 networks built on top of the base Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis update is part of a major push by Ethereum developers to head toward mass scalability via Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nReports from digital asset managers Grayscale and Fidelity Digital Assets indicate the update could be a boon for scaling the overall Ethereum userbase.\n\nEthereum is scheduled to undergo a network update called the Deneb-Cancun, or Dencun, on Wednesday, aimed at improving user experience and lowering transaction fees for some users on the the network's Layer 2 blockchains.\n\nEther (ETH), the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, soared past $4,000 early Wednesday, but gave up some of those gains to trade a shade under that threshold at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.\n\nWhat is the Dencun Ethereum Update?\n\nThe Dencun update prioritizes scalability, efficiency, and security through the implementation of various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\n\nAccording to the Ethereum Foundation, the most notable change is EIP-4844 for proto-danksharding, which seeks to optimize gas fees for Layer 2 network (L2) data and enhance the network's ability to handle greater transaction volumes via those secondary layers.\n\nExchanges may face delays in processing Ethereum transactions on Wednesday as the update rolls out. Coinbase (COIN) said Monday that it expects disruption due to the update to last for at least an hour on or around 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, although that could change. Kraken, meanwhile, is budgeting for about 15 mins of delay for maintenance around 4:00 a.m. Eastern time and recommends users \"not to place or cancel orders during this timeframe.\"\n\nBlobs, Rollups, Gas: What Is Changing?\n\nLayer 2 networks, such as rollups, are secondary blockchains built on top of the base Ethereum network. In a bid to scale transaction volumes, rollups compress transactions by bundling them. The initial verification for those transactions happens off the chain, but the transactions are settled on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHowever, even with the compression, nodes processing transactions hold on to Layer 2 data forever, expanding their hardware requirements, which are then passed on to users via higher transaction or gas fees. More than 90% of the fees paid by users on rollups are because of this data storage.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will alter that, allowing information related to Layer 2 networks to be added to the base Ethereum blockchain via temporary, more efficiently stored \"blobs\" rather than as permanent data. As of this writing, blob data will be available for 18 days. This is intended to lower costs.\n\n\"Each byte of data that L2s store on Ethereum costs roughly 16 gas. The introduction of blobs and a new fee market designed for blob data drops the gas cost down to 1 per byte of data stored,\" noted Fidelity Digital Assets in a report about the upgrade. \"This is a maximum gas cost reduction of 94%!\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Ethereum users on the main blockchain or Layer 1 users won't stand to benefit much from the lower fees found on Layer 2 networks after the upgrade.\n\nMore Accessible and Competitive Ethereum?\n\n\"Currently, Ethereum\u2019s performance is hindered by its slow transaction speed, low throughput, and high costs for users. With average transaction fees of $2.3 as of February 22nd, Ethereum is significantly more expensive versus alternatives like Solana. This threatens to drive away end users to other chains,\" said crypto asset manager Grayscale in a report.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade \"could help Ethereum compete in terms of scalability with faster chains,\" the Grayscale report said.\n\nFidelity also points out that in addition to differentiating it from competitors, the latest changes to the Ethereum network could help transition from being a general-purpose blockchain to a global database for Layer 2 networks. The best way to gauge the success of the Dencun upgrade will be to track the number of Layer 2 users via a metric such as active addresses,\" Fidelity said.\n\n\n\n(Update\u2014March 13, 2024: This story has been updated with more recent ETH price information.)"

        "title": "Blockchain startup Sei Labs creates an interesting solution to make Ethereum faster - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Sei Labs, a startup co-founded by a former Robinhood engineer and a former VC from Coatue, has launched a new open sourced project that offers a novel and exciting approach to make Ethereum faster and less expensive for developers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sei launched The Parallel Stack, a public good project \u2014 meaning free for any crypto developers to use. It aims to improve the performance of transactions per second (TPS) of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based layer-2 blockchains through the tried-and-true computer science concept of parallel processing, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\n\nSei Labs is a company the crypto community is already watching after it raised $30 million, at a valuation of $800 million, about a year ago to build its own super-speedy, open source, layer-1 blockchain focused specifically on crypto trading.\n\nBut now Sei has turned its attention to help improve Ethereum, a far bigger, more established blockchain, the biggest by total value locked, according to CoinMarketCap \u2014 aka the value of all the digital assets on the network.\n\nBy default, EVMs process transactions sequentially, one after another, a slow and inefficient method that doesn\u2019t scale well.\n\n\u201cThe biggest limitation of the EVM is the lack of throughput,\u201d Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, formerly of Robinhood, told TechCrunch. Ethereum\u2019s throughput can\u2019t go beyond 50 TPS, which is limiting growth of its ecosystem and results in high so-called gas fees, the fees charged to transact on Ethereum blockchains. These fees make Ethereum unaffordable for \u201c99.9% of normal users,\u201d Jog added.\n\nAside from The Parallel Stack, Sei Labs has also been working on upgrading its blockchain to Sei V2, a parallelized EVM, which processes multiple transactions simultaneously and would make it accessible to a \u201cglobal base of EVM developers,\u201d according to a November 2023 blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on scaling EVM for a long time and doing it by parallelizing,\u201d Jog said.\n\nObviously, the higher the transactions per second, the faster, more efficient and scalable a network is. For reference, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, by default, averages 5 TPS, while Ethereum\u2019s average 20-30 TPS. Solana\u2019s is around 2,500 TPS and some of the newer, Ethereum-centric layer-2 blockchains like Polygon and Arbitrum can do 65,000 and 40,000 TPS, respectively.\n\nThe Parallel Stack can do around 5,000 TPS, but is aiming to hit 10,000 TPS by the end of the year, Jog said.\n\nSei, of course, isn\u2019t the only one working to make Ethereum faster and cheaper. Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, an \u201cEVM equivalent\u201d layer-2 blockchain, does an average of 2,000 TPS. But they use different design philosophies and Sei\u2019s focus is on higher throughput through parallel processing, said Jeff Feng, Sei Labs co-founder, previously an investor at Coatue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a stove; you can cook two things at the same time, as opposed to one dish then another,\u201d Feng said. \u201cHistorically if you wanted that kind of TPS, you needed to build on Solana and learn a brand new development framework.\u201d\n\nBut if Sei is building its own layer-1 blockchain, not derived from Ethereum, why would it be working to solve Ethereum\u2019s problem? Because Ethereum is where most developers are and scaling is a problem they think they can also address. And if Sei can offer them a way to adopt parallel processing to improve their Ethereum work, they could also learn core tenets of Sei\u2019s ecosystem along the way.\n\nPlus, they don\u2019t see the two blockchains as competitors. \u201cOur goal is to scale the EVM. There has been significant interest to have parallel EVMs and this is a natural next step: democratizing access to make it as plug and play as possible,\u201d Jog said.\n\nSo perhaps it makes sense that Sei is honing in on the EVM space, to reach a majority of the blockchain developers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost been a no-brainer but it clearly unlocks a level of performance and throughput that allows for applications much larger to successfully build and stay on Ethereum,\u201d Feng said. \u201cWith parallelization, it will bring the industry forward.\u201d\n\nBut why would they freely share their work as open source projects? Sei\u2019s framework isn\u2019t the first to do it, but holds true to the ethos many crypto projects have of providing open code for anyone to build with.\n\n\u201cI was at Robinhood when the GameStop saga happened; a small number of people were making decisions and we didn\u2019t know anything until the news came out,\u201d Jog said. The lack of internal transparency made him want to build a decentralized chain that is open sourced, so anyone can access it and it\u2019s not limited to a group of people.\n\nJog and Feng anticipate initial excitement for The Parallel Stack to come from existing Ethereum-focused applications that are hitting bandwidth issues and are looking for higher TPS options."

        "title": "Dencun Upgrade Goes Live, Ushering in New Era for Ethereum - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun upgrade went live Wednesday morning without a hitch, ushering in a new chapter for the blockchain that is poised to substantially lower transaction costs across Ethereum layer-2 networks and massively expand the blockchain ecosystem\u2019s capabilities.\n\nJust before 10 a.m. EST, the Dencun upgrade was successfully implemented. It will now take a period of about a month or two for settlement contracts across all layer-2 networks to incorporate the update. Once they do, gas fees on layer-2 networks should immediately fall by 75%, Terence Tsao, a developer of Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, previously told Decrypt.\n\nScreenshot of Ethereum Foundation YouTube livestream\n\nLeading up to the hard fork, Ethereum developers held a livestream on YouTube to discuss the different Ethereum Improvement Proposals that would be rolling out as Dencun went live and explain some of the new terminology, like blobs\u2014which are a new way to organize and send data on the network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the upgrade went live, ASCII art of a blob appeared on the screen.\n\nEthereum has undergone multiple flashy upgrades in recent years, including the 2022 merge, which transitioned the network to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model, and 2023\u2019s Shanghai upgrade, which unlocked tens of billions of dollars worth of ETH staked with the network for withdrawal. But several developers who help build Ethereum believe that Dencun is poised to change the network to a degree never before seen.\n\n\u201cI think that this upgrade will have the biggest effect for users of all the Ethereum upgrades yet,\u201d Marius Van Der Wijden, an Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. \u201cDencun is a much bigger update than Shanghai.\u201d\n\nNot only will Dencun drastically cut transaction costs on layer-2 networks; it will also, by doing so, redefine the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s capacity to process massive swathes of transactions, and thus lower barriers significantly for moving projects, transactions, and data on-chain.\n\nDavid Silverman, VP of Product at Polygon Labs, previously analogized to Decrypt that Dencun will single-handedly expand Ethereum from a country backroad into a four-lane highway, in terms of the efficiency and ease with which the ecosystem will soon be able to process unprecedented amounts of on-chain traffic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGas costs might drop so low following Dencun that they will be covered by crypto companies and projects going forward\u2014essentially making such fees a thing of the past, Silverman added.\n\nSuch an unprecedented shift in the economics of Ethereum would come at a time when gas fees on the network's mainnet have recently spiked to near-unusable highs. That fact isn't lost on Dencun's developers.\n\n\"We are focused on scaling and reducing fees in L2 at a time when Ethereum's usage is reaching high volumes again and gas fees are a noticeable cost to most users,\" Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon told Decrypt.\n\nKey to Dencun's near-elimination of gas fees is proto-danksharding, a novel method for data storage on Ethereum introduced by Dencun. Proto-danksharding, which utilizes features called \u201cblobs,\u201d will allow layer-2 data to be stored on-chain temporarily for a period of about a month. Until now, data could only be stored on Ethereum forever, an immensely expensive option that greatly limited what data was uploaded on-chain.\n\nDevelopers hope that Dencun will usher in a new chapter for Ethereum, one in which there are essentially no limits\u2014related to cost, storage, or anything else\u2014on the amount of data that can exist on-chain. Such a landscape could revolutionize the types of projects and tools built across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI hope Dencun will unlock new use cases that were not possible before,\u201d Ethereum\u2019s Van Der Wijden said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building this for short-term unsustainable gains, but for long-term sustainable growth.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin and ethereum\u2019s intrinsic valuations - ETF Stream",
        "content": "Robert Greer, author of What is an asset class anyway?, argues assets that lack an objective measure of value and have a supply constraint are more vulnerable to irrational exuberance, citing the \u2018dot-com\u2019 bubble as an example.\n\nCrypto assets lack an objective measure of value today among investors, similar to emerging tech companies in the late 1990s.\n\nWe can value any asset using two approaches \u2013 intrinsic or relative. Intrinsic valuation measures an asset\u2019s value based on its capacity to generate cash flows.\n\nOn the other hand, relative valuation methods, also called \u201cpricing\u201d, estimate how much to pay for an asset based on what others are paying for comparable ones.\n\nInvestors might use a discounted cash flow method (DCF) to value a stock, but they would not use that for a piece of fine art.\n\nSimilarly, we must outline the various types of crypto assets to understand the differences we may expect in their value accrual and specific valuation approaches.\n\nIn this regard, it is helpful to categorise crypto assets according to the three asset superclasses proposed by Robert Greer:\n\nCapital assets: \u201cAn ongoing source of something of value\u201d (e.g., bonds and stocks). Consumable/transformable assets: \u201cYou can consume it. You can transform it into another asset. It has economic value. But it does not yield an ongoing stream of value\u201d (e.g., physical commodities). Store of value assets: \u201cThey cannot be consumed, nor can they generate income. Yet they do have value\u201d (e.g., currencies and collectibles).\n\nLike the internet architecture, cryptoassets and blockchain technology have two layers: (1) infrastructure and (2) applications.\n\nIn his 2019 work, Chris Burniske categorised crypto assets at the infrastructure layer based on the consensus mechanism of the blockchain:\n\nProof-of-Work (PoW): In PoW networks like bitcoin, the native asset (BTC) relies on a computationally and energy-intensive lottery called mining to determine which block of transactions to settle on the blockchain and reward the miners. Hence, they belong to the consumable/transformable asset superclass, as they essentially create \u201ca digital-native commodity in the form of secure, globally accessible ledger space\u201d. Investors can use the mining cost of production as a fundamental metric to gauge the lower-bound price of PoW crypto assets like BTC. Proof-of-Stake (PoS): In networks like ethereum and solana, validators must commit a portion of their capital \u2013 the \u201cstake\u201d, in this case, ETH \u2013 to gain access to a recurring value stream generated by the network\u2019s rules. Hence, they fall in the capital asset category, and their value may be derived from the net present value of annual flows to validators using a DCF method.\n\nWhile we will not delve too deeply into the application layer, we can apply the same first-principles thinking:\n\nGovernance tokens yield voting rights and represent ownership of the application. They are analogous to common stock in traditional finance, so they fall in the capital asset class. Utility tokens drive the economics of the system as their sole function, meaning they fall in the Consumable Asset category. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are collectibles like fine art in their most typical form today, falling in the Store of Value category.\n\nIntrinsic valuation: Ethereum\n\nFrom the standpoint of a validator, PoS assets like ETH are akin to a stock paying a dividend yield, which means we can conduct a DCF valuation following four simple steps:\n\n1. Estimate the cash flows during the life of the crypto asset\n\na. Transaction fees within the network accrue to validators. Just so, fees are a proxy for revenue. Ethereum validators received $401.7m in transaction fees (net after the burn mechanism) from 28 January 2023 to 28 January.\n\nb. Token issuance does not dilute the value of validators. On the contrary, they have the right to new issuance, similar to how shareholders may receive stock-based compensation. ETH Issuance from January 28 2023, to January 28, 2024, amounted to $1.5bn.\n\nc. Total cash clows: a + b = ~$1.9bn in the first year.\n\n2. Estimate expected future cash flows and the lifespan of the crypto asset\n\na. Future cash flows: We propose a slight variation of the three-stage growth model to project ethereum\u2019s future cash flows. Specifically, we forecast an initial period of aggressive growth, followed by an incremental decrease that eventually stabilises at a more moderate growth rate.\n\nb. Lifespan of the asset: With public companies that at least in theory can last forever, equity analysts generally assume that cash flows beyond a specific point in time continue in perpetuity. Investors may apply the same logic to PoS crypto assets, but for simplicity\u2019s sake, we assume ETH\u2019s life will be 20 years.\n\n3. Estimate the discount rate to apply to these cash flows\n\na. Lower-bound discount rate (9.9%): In the past 10 years, the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF obtained a 9.90% compound annual return.\n\nb. Higher-bound discount rate (21.9%): Obtained using the Fama and French Three-Factor Model (market premium, size premium and value premium).\n\n4. Estimate the net present value (NPV) of cash flows using the above parameters\n\nAssuming a discount rate of 9.09%, the implied price per one ETH today would be ~$5,315, a 134% increase from ETH\u2019s price ($2,268) as of January 28, 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, if we use a 21.90% discount rate, the implied price per one ETH would be **$1,349**, a ~41% decrease from ETH\u2019s price, as of 28 January.\n\nInvestors should interpret the results of this DCF valuation with caution and run their own assumptions regarding projected cash flows and discount rates.\n\nThe rationale behind our approach was to be conservative and capture the high volatility of ETH in the discount rate to accurately reflect the asset\u2019s riskiness.\n\nAnother implicit assumption of this approach is that the asset\u2019s monetary premium (Store of Value) is embedded into the DCF.\n\nSource: https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/bitcoin-new-asset-class\n\nIntrinsic valuation: Bitcoin\n\nWhen it comes to crypto-commodities, the marginal cost of production is vital as it sets the price floor at which producers (miners) are willing to sell. From the outset, it is crucial to emphasise that we are not suggesting that the price of BTC should be determined by its marginal cost of production.\n\nTo do so would be to adopt a labour theory of value, which is ostensibly false. Instead, the marginal cost of production is a tool that can help investors estimate a lower bound price level for BTC and other crypto-commodities.\n\nSource: 21Shares\n\nIn 2019, Charles Edwards proposed a methodology to estimate the global average US dollar cost of producing one BTC. The first component of the method is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption index (CBECI), which provides an up-to-date estimate of the bitcoin network\u2019s daily electricity load.\n\nEdwards estimates the cost of production per BTC by:\n\nCalculating the number of BTC mined per ray (based on miner rewards) Calculating the daily electricity cost to mine one BTC (daily electrical cost) Estimating the global average \u201celec-to-total cost ratio\u201d = (bitcoin electrical cost)/(daily cost of running a bitcoin mining business).\n\nAn investor can then compute bitcoin production cost as (daily electrical cost)/ (elec-to-total cost ratio).\n\nFinally, the bitcoin production cost is compared to the \u201cbitcoin miner price\u201d, which attempts to capture the revenue one BTC provides to miners.\n\nBitcoin miner price is calculated as follows: BTC price + (daily transaction fees)/(daily BTC mined).\n\nWhen the BTC price is below the total cost of mining one BTC, it signals that bitcoin miners may be struggling and potentially taking short-term losses.\n\nThe estimated global average electricity cost to mine one bitcoin is $23,211.1, as of 28 January, while the estimated global average total cost to mine one bitcoin is $38,685.1.\n\nTo reiterate, investors should not interpret this range as the fundamental value of bitcoin, which is subjective, but rather as an estimate of its price floor based on miner profitability and subsequent behaviour patterns.\n\nThis article first appeared in ETF Insider, ETF Stream's monthly ETF magazine for professional investors in Europe.

        "content": "Bloomberg analysts have significantly reduced the likelihood of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by May.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s silence and inaction have led analysts to reassess the chances of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, with Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas now estimating a 30% probability, down from his January prediction of 70%.\n\nThe absence of typical pre-approval activities, such as filing changes and issuer engagement, has been a cause for concern among industry experts.\n\nThe revised estimates come as the SEC has not provided feedback or engaged with ETF issuers, which is typically part of the approval process.\n\nThe lack of movement and communication from the SEC has dampened the previously optimistic outlook for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, contrasting with the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s stance on Ethereum as a security, as opposed to a commodity like Bitcoin, may influence its decision-making process. SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s previous political challenges following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a court loss to Grayscale in August 2023 could also be factors in the SEC\u2019s current approach.\n\nEthereum traded at around US$3,970, at 3 p.m. ET, according to CoinGecko."

        "title": "Three reasons why the SEC might not greenlight Ethereum ETFs - DLNews",
        "content": "Analysts are getting pessimistic about the chances of Ethereum spot ETFs being approved in May.\n\nThe SEC could decide to deny the applications for a number of reasons.\n\nThese include political pushback, the uncertainty around Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status, and a lower risk of litigation.\n\nDespite approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission may deny similar products for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by value.\n\nThe agency has yet to meaningfully engage with prospective Ethereum spot ETF issuers, Bloomberg analysts have noted, and with a crucial deadline looming in two and a half months, the lack of communication isn\u2019t a good sign.\n\nWhy the SEC may deny\n\nThere are three main reasons why the SEC may deny spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe first is that Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status isn\u2019t clearly defined. While SEC chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly stated that Bitcoin is a commodity and should be regulated as such, he has made great efforts to remain vague about Ethereum.\n\nMuddying the waters is that the SEC approved Ethereum futures ETFs in October. That means the regulator \u201cimplicitly [classified] Ethereum as a non-security commodity,\u201d according to ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci.\n\nThe second reason has to do with political blowback. The SEC was heavily criticised by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, for greenlighting Bitcoin spot ETFs \u2014 even though it approved these ETFs only after a court loss.\n\n\u201cThe SEC is wrong on the law and wrong on the policy with respect to the Bitcoin ETF decision,\u201d Warren posted on X in January, before adding that the agency was letting \u201ccrypto burrow even deeper into our financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cGary is in the Warren doghouse\u201d for issuing the Bitcoin spot ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X on Sunday. \u201cIt may be that simple.\u201d\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe third reason is that the SEC may believe it\u2019s less exposed to the threat of lawsuits. Grayscale Investments sued the agency after it denied its application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, but may be less inclined to do so this time around.\n\n\u201cGrayscale may be less excited to subsidise another blockbuster hit product for BlackRock,\u201d Balchunas said, referring to the overwhelming success of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, which was launched in January at the same time as Grayscale secured the right to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nAlternatively, the SEC \u201ccould come up with new grounds for denial that weren\u2019t tested by Grayscale in court, which would likely also be subject to a court challenge but may be easier for the SEC to justify,\u201d Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at venture-capital firm Variant, wrote on Monday.\n\nThe agency could also be \u201cwilling to take litigation risk and lose in court based on a preference for being viewed as \u2018fighters\u2019 in a war against crypto rather than being accused of rolling over,\u201d Chervinsky said.\n\nShould it decide to approve the Ethereum spot ETFs, the SEC is likely to proceed as it did with Bitcoin ETFs and greenlight all of them at once to avoid giving an unfair advantage to a particular fund. That brings the final deadline for a decision to May 23.\n\nBalchunas revised on Monday the odds of an Ethereum spot ETF approval to 35% \u2014 down from 70% in February.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, trading at $71,342.\n\nEthereum slumped 1.5% in the same period, priced at $3,962.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "title": "Dencun Upgrade: Ethereum's Leap into the Future of L2 Scalability is Here - hackernoon.com",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with Ethereum, you know its mission \u2013 to be scalable, secure, and decentralized. As Ethereum's popularity has surged, so too have the demands on its network, raising gas fees and highlighting its scalability challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 2 solutions, Ethereum's answer to the scalability problem, enabled handling transactions off the main chain without compromising its core principles. Still, gas prices on L2 \u2013 lower, but not yet low enough \u2013 remain a barrier to Ethereum\u2019s widespread adoption. Imagine finding an NFT collection you like, only to discover that the transaction will cost nearly as much as the NFT itself! Even on L2, this scenario is all too common.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, March 13, 2024, this is all going to change!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about the day? Well, the next Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, is scheduled for activation, as announced during Consensus Layer Call 127 and confirmed by Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDencun is poised to be a game-changer for Ethereum's scalability. Encompassing a hard fork involving Deneb (Consensus layer) and Cancun (Execution layer) upgrades, Dencun promises to usher in a new era of affordability for transactions on Ethereum L2s. With the upgrade already live on devnets and testnets like Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky, and Mainnet readiness confirmed, we finally stand on the brink of a gigantic leap forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most anticipated changes is the introduction of off-chain data blobs via Proto-Danksharding. Let\u2019s explore what this entails for Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnveiling Blobs and Proto-Danksharding\n\nData blobs are a novel concept designed to optimize L2 transaction data storage on Ethereum. Currently, rollups store their data in transaction calldata . It\u2019s not only limited in size but is also stored forever, creating a problem of always-rising requirements for running a validator.\n\n\n\n\n\nProto-Danksharding , as introduced by EIP-4844 , lays the groundwork for an innovative, dramatically more efficient data handling mechanism, addressing the limitations of current on-chain data storage. With data blobs, specifically designed to handle large amounts of data outside the main Ethereum blockchain, rollups will be able to store data in a more cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new storage solution for rollup transactions will reduce the rate of future Ethereum data growth, contributing to a leaner and more efficient network. For developers, this brings the ability to create more complex and data-intensive smart contracts without being hindered by prohibitive gas costs. For users, it translates into lower fees, making L2-based applications more accessible and appealing to a wider audience. Finally, it also allows Ethereum Validator Node Operators to optimize disk space usage as blobs are pruned after around 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expected Effect of the Dencun Upgrade on the Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nSeveral key players in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as OP Labs and the zkSync team, have provided quantitative insights into the expected benefits of this upgrade. OP Labs forecasts an extraordinary 20x reduction in gas costs for data storage on Ethereum by Optimism L2. Similarly, the zkSync team anticipates a tenfold decrease in gas costs for data storage, projecting the total gas costs on zkSync to drop from an average of $0.20 per transaction to under $0.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these projections highlight dramatic savings in data storage costs, it's important to keep in mind that the overall gas costs experienced by users involve multiple factors beyond L1 data storage. The Proto-Danksharding upgrade, by reducing the rate of future Ethereum data growth, addresses a crucial aspect of transaction costs. However, the actual effect on user transaction fees will vary, as these fees also depend on computational complexity, network congestion, and other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Dencun: The Road to Full Danksharding\n\nAs you can see, the Dencun upgrade is indeed a crucial milestone for Ethereum. Yet, it is only the first step on a much larger, bolder path towards full Danksharding. This future phase in Ethereum's evolution is set to massively boost the network\u2019s transaction processing capability and efficiency. Imagine a blockchain that can smoothly process more than 100,000 transactions per second. Yes, that's where we're headed!\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned above, Proto-Danksharding sets the groundwork by integrating off-chain data blobs and reducing the cost of L2 data storage on Ethereum. The full Danksharding expands on these principles, aiming to increase the maximum amount of blobs per block from 16 to 64. This transition does not just mean an increase in data storage efficiency but a fundamental re-architecture of how blocks are processed and validated across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move towards full Danksharding will require several significant technical and operational changes:\n\nProposer-Builder Separation : This mechanism separates the roles of proposing blocks and building blocks within the network. Dealing with a large amount of blobs per block would be too tasking for a single builder+proposer, so the duties will be separated. Additionally, this change will reduce the risk of censorship or manipulation by preventing proposers (validators) from being influenced by the contents they're including in a block.\n\n\n\nData Availability Sampling: To ensure data within shards remains available, DAS allows nodes to verify the availability of shard data without needing to download the entire shard. This technique is crucial for maintaining blob data integrity and accessibility efficiently across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the Future of Ethereum!\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is a pivotal milestone for Ethereum, marking a major leap forward in its evolution. This upgrade not only promises to elevate the platform's efficiency and L2 transaction affordability but also lays the foundational steps toward the much-anticipated transition to full Danksharding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we transition into this transformative phase, it's imperative for the Ethereum community, including developers, investors, and enthusiasts, to remain informed and actively contribute, thus ensuring a seamless evolution of the ecosystem. Engaging across forums, chats and social media, as well as participating in development projects, enriches our collective journey towards realizing a more efficient, inclusive, and forward-thinking blockchain platform for all."

        "content": "Never have I ever seen so much anti-Ethereum propaganda on my Twitter timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery other day, there\u2019s a new Layer 1 that is doubted as the \u201cEthereum killer\u201d, but Ethereum doesn\u2019t know it, so it remains undeterred, focusing on its growth and improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis commitment to progress is evident in the recently unveiled Ethereum roadmap for 2024, spotlighting key developments that promise to enhance scalability and user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those, finally, a date was set for EIP-4844, which will make it much easier for Layer 2 to publish data on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile competition becomes fierce, these new ERC and EIP are set to greatly improve Ethereum's scalability and user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's dive into these exciting updates, including ERC-4337, EIP-4844, EIP-3074, and EIP-5003.\n\nERC-4337: Revolutionizing Smart Contract Wallets\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the ERC-4337 standard is a significant leap in the evolution of smart contract wallets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis improvement introduces a novel concept called \"account abstraction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nERC-4337 is an Account Abstraction proposal that completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the bottom-layer transaction type, this proposal introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a UserOperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on ERC-4337: https://twitter.com/johnrising_/status/1629470535397539840\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Ethereum accounts are separated into externally owned accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. However, user-operated EOAs often pose challenges in terms of usability and security.\n\n\n\n\n\nERC-4337 blurs these lines, allowing users to interact with smart contracts more intuitively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way users interact with Ethereum needs to step up to the enhanced complexity of the landscape. We have already seen the emergence of Account abstraction-based solutions, such as Creso Wallet and Avocado Wallet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of ERC-4337 will pose the foundation for a series of improvements to wallet designs, as well as reduced complexity for end users.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, ERC-4337 greatly improves the end-user experience as well as enables new possibilities such as gasless transactions or social logins and password recovery.\n\nKey Features of ERC-4337 Include:\n\nEnhanced Security: By integrating more complex logic into wallets, users can set conditions for transactions, like multi-factor authentication or daily spending limits.\n\n\n\n\n\nUser-Friendly: It simplifies interactions for non-technical users, making the Ethereum ecosystem more accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\nGas Fee Payments in Tokens: Users could potentially pay transaction fees in tokens other than ETH, adding a layer of convenience.\n\nEIP-4844: Boosting Layer 2 Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy EIP-4844: To create a cheap place for L2 solutions to post data on Ethereum and reduce overall transaction fees users pay on L2 by a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: L2s produce an increasing amount of data. If there\u2019s a way to post that data cheaply, this will immediately reduce how much the networks charge users to transact.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: New transaction format for \u201cblob-carrying transactions\u201d. It contains a large amount of data that \u201ccannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed.\u201d Instead of embedding the full contents in the body, the contents of the blobs are propagated separately, as a \u201csidecar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-4844, often referred to as \"proto-danksharding\" is a significant stride towards solving Ethereum's scalability issues. It introduces a new transaction type that allows \"shard blobs\" \u2013 temporary data that can be used by Layer 2 solutions like rollups.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-4844 introduces a new kind of transaction type to Ethereum which accepts \"blobs\" of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of containing transactions being executed in the Ethereum blocks, shard blocks would just contain \u201cblobs of data\u201d and would be the responsibility of L2 to use that data space to create a secure and more scalable experience for their users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is important about EIP-4844 is that its value will trickle down to users, as we will all be able to benefit from lower L2 fees.\n\nWhy Will L2s Fees Be Lower?\n\nEIP-4844 separates fees for transaction computation and storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nL2 will use a different function to submit \u201cblobs\u201d to Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using \u201cCALLDATA\u201d, which stores data forever, they would use blobs, which are pruned after a pre-defined period.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blobs of data don\u2019t have to be available forever, but for a certain period (e.g., 1-3 months), long enough to allow L2s to ensure at least 1 honest actor to reconstruct the state and challenge or replace the bad sequencer. The data gets then pruned.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-4844 provides significant scaling relief for rollups by allowing them to initially scale to 0.25 MB per slot, with a separate fee market for blobs allowing fees to be very low.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead: transactions will be 10x cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Potential Impacts of EIP-4844 Include\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced Costs for Layer 2: By lowering the data costs, it makes Layer 2 solutions more economical, encouraging broader adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Transaction Throughput: This can lead to a more scalable network, capable of handling more transactions per second.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced User Experience: With faster and cheaper transactions, the overall user experience on Ethereum improves dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wrote an extensive article on this a while ago:\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-3074: Streamlining Transactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EIP-3074 is a new primitive, that will open the doors for more seamless UX on Ethereum, without the need for additional trust assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-3074 introduces a fundamental change in how Ethereum transactions are authorized and executed. The proposal allows a user to authorize a third party to execute transactions on their behalf, using a new type of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-3074 aims to update Ethereum\u2019s EOAs so they can delegate control to smart contracts \u2014 allowing smart contracts to approve transactions originating from user accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, EIP-3074 would allow the execution of complex operations with a single signature, with no need for multiple approvals, greatly improving the UX as well as allowing the execution of complex operations seamlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd users will be able to send batched transactions, expiring transactions, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on EIP-3074: https://twitter.com/lightclients/status/1371911245561917441\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for this to work, the Ethereum protocol would need to be modified, with two new EVM \u201copcodes\u201d: AUTH and AUTHCALL.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this reason, EIP-3074 is usually viewed less favorably compared to other Account Abstraction proposals, such as EIP-4337.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on the concerns about this EIP:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1418441829314220032\n\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, EIP-3074 would introduce new use cases, such as:\n\nSmart Contract wallets: with wallet recovery solutions you will never lose your funds again.\n\nBatch Transactions: saving on gas costs.\n\nAutomations: automate transactions thanks to smart contract accounts.\n\nThe Benefits of EIP-3074 Include:\n\nSimplified User Interactions: Especially beneficial for complex DApp interactions, reducing the steps and gas costs for users.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Flexibility for Developers: This allows for more creative and efficient smart contract designs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Security Enhancements: Though it introduces new security considerations, it also offers the opportunity for more robust security mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP-5003: Network Resource Optimization\n\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal combines very well with EIP-3074, which provides the \u201copcodes\u201d to delegate EAOs signing authority to a smart contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile EIP-3074 authorizes smart contracts, EIP-5003 completely migrates the signing key of Ethereum EOAs accounts to smart contract accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA limited application of only EIP-3074 would create new vectors of attacks around the authority delegation to smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile EIP-5003 is less publicized, it plays a crucial role in enhancing the Ethereum network's efficiency and security.\n\nThe Expected Advantages of EIP-5003 Are:\n\nImproved Security: This EIP combines with EIP-3074 to solve its shortcomings and ensure there are no new vectors of attack from the Account Abstraction\u2019s migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration away from EOAs: This EIP is the final migration away from EOAs.\n\nConclusion: A Future-Proof Ethereum\n\nWhile its development is often considered to be slow and controlled to prioritize security, Ethereum does not stay idle, and it would be incorrect to observe and assess its technology only according to what it looks like at every specific moment in time, for it is always evolving and improving.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, Ethereum's 2024 roadmap illustrates a clear vision for the future, and a commitment to addressing critical areas like scalability, security, accessibility, and usability and making sure the network remains future-proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nA strong focus is placed on redefining how users interact with Ethereum, shifting from EOA accounts to more flexible smart contract wallets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation of ERC-4337, EIP-4844, EIP-3074, and EIP-5003, each plays a pivotal role in this evolutionary journey:\n\n\n\n\n\nERC-4337 revolutionizes smart contract wallets through account abstraction, offering enhanced security and user-friendliness. This standard is poised to significantly simplify the user experience and broaden accessibility to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nEIP-4844, or \"proto-danksharding\" is a breakthrough in reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions. By introducing a new transaction format for blob-carrying transactions, it promises to lower transaction fees and increase throughput, benefiting the end users with more affordable and faster transactions.\n\nEIP-3074 and EIP-5003 together represent a significant step in streamlining transactions and optimizing network resources. While EIP-3074 introduces new operational capabilities for authorizing transactions, EIP-5003 complements it by transitioning signing authority from Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to smart contract accounts, bolstering network security and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Ethereum continues to innovate and improve, it will continue to fight for its relevance in the face of heightened competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of this piece is to incentivize readers to look at Ethereum not as a static network but as a network in constant development and evolution, actively working to become future-proof against emerging technologies and alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue monitoring the implementation of EIP and how Ethereum will evolve over the year.\n\nThe author of this post is not associated with the projects mentioned in this article in any way.

        "content": "The imminent launch of the Ethereum Dencun upgrade at 14.00 UTC today, March 13, has sparked a notable surge in the prices of native tokens for layer-2 protocols, including Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate\u2019s data, the sector has surged by approximately 5% in the last 24 hours, reaching a total market capitalization of $20.21 billion. This growth maintains a consistent upward trend of 10% observed throughout the week.\n\nLayer-2 tokens increase\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Arbitrum\u2019s ARB token surged by approximately 10% to reach $2.18. This surge coincides with the team\u2019s planned release of over $1 billion ARB tokens this week.\n\nArbitrum is the leading layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution, with assets worth approximately $16 billion locked on the platform, according to L2Beat.\n\nDuring the same period, Polygon network\u2019s MATIC token witnessed a 4% uptick to $1.23, marking its highest value since March 2023. This upward trend is concurrent with a notable increase in the active addresses on the Polygon PoS chain, which recorded over 1 million daily active addresses for 20 consecutive days.\n\nSimilarly, Optimism\u2019s OP token rose by 2.26% to $4.5, according to CryptoSlate data, a significant milestone considering its starting point at around $3.5 earlier this month.\n\nNotably, the Optimism Foundation disclosed a private sale of 19.5 million OP tokens last week. While the buyer remains undisclosed, the agreement includes a 2-year vesting period.\n\nLastly, Loopring\u2019s LRC experienced a more modest gain of 1.34% during the same reporting period, currently trading at $0.43140 as of press time.\n\nWhy are they rising?\n\nThe token\u2019s price surge can be credited to the upcoming Dencun upgrade, which is set to launch within a few hours.\n\nDencun aims to improve Ethereum\u2019s network scalability significantly. The integration of EIP-4844, known as proto-dank sharding, will introduce blob-type transactions, lowering transaction costs for layer-2 chains. This move will enable mass scalability via layer-2 rollups by minimizing data availability expenses.\n\nMara Schmiedt, the CEO of Alluvial, told CryptoSlate that the Dencun Upgrade represents a giant leap in Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem resilience and performance.\n\nAccording to her:\n\n\u201cThe combination of Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric scalability model, the upcoming Dencun upgrade, and the rapid proliferation and transaction growth on L2 points to an optimistic future.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Deep Dive Into Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade - LCX",
        "content": "Understanding Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade\n\nThe highly anticipated Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade is a hard divergence that signifies a substantial turning point in the continuous development of the Ethereum network. By capitalizing on the achievements of prior enhancements, including the recent Shanghai upgrade, Dencun endeavors to implement significant security, usability, and scalability improvements. This section will provide an in-depth analysis of the upgrade, examining the significant improvements and features that Ethereum stakeholders and enthusiasts can anticipate.\n\nCancun: Scalability Improvements- The Cancun enhancement primarily targets the Ethereum network\u2019s execution layer. The document presents a number of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that aim to optimise gas efficiency and scalability. One noteworthy EIP is EIP-1234, which ensures a seamless transition to Ethereum 2.0 by modifying the block reward and delaying the \u201cdifficulty bomb.\u201d\n\nDeneb: Enhancing Security and Consensus- The Deneb upgrade is specifically designed to improve the security and consensus mechanisms of the Ethereum consensus layer. An essential EIP is EIP-2322, which introduces a more robust and efficient enhancement to the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nEIPs Finalised for Implementation- The Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade integrates a number of finalised EIPs that are now slated for deployment. These consist of:\n\nEIP 1559: This proposal (EIP-1559) presents a novel fee framework with the dual objectives of enhancing user satisfaction and diminishing transaction charges. The implementation of a dynamically adjusting base fee in response to network demand streamlines the process of fee estimation and mitigates congestion.\n\nEIP-2929: This EIP fortifies the Ethereum network\u2019s security by augmenting the expenses associated with specific operations. As a result, malicious actors will find prospective attacks more costly to execute.\n\nEIP-2537: It presents a novel opcode tailored for Ethereum, which streamlines the verification process of elliptic curve signatures by contracts. This improvement enhances both privacy and scalability.\n\nExpected Benefits- The Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade provides the Ethereum ecosystem and its users with tremendous potential. The objective of the upgrade is to furnish developers and end-users with a more streamlined and intuitive experience through the resolution of scalability concerns, optimization of gas efficiency, and reinforcement of security measures. Furthermore, it establishes the groundwork for forthcoming developments and facilitates Ethereum\u2019s shift towards a consensus mechanism that is entirely PoS.\n\nImplementation and Timeline- It is anticipated that the Cancun-Deneb Upgrade will take place in the future months, although an exact date has not been specified. By actively working on the deployment and testing procedures, the Ethereum community and developers are minimizing potential network disruptions and ensuring a seamless transition.\n\nTherefore, the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade signifies a substantial advancement for the Ethereum blockchain. By prioritizing scalability, security, and usability, this upgrade endeavors to tackle significant obstacles and grant Ethereum and its thriving ecosystem access to fresh prospects.\n\nWhat Is the Concept of Proto-Danksharding?\n\nOne of the notable developments in the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Upgrade is the implementation of danksharding and proto-danksharding. These technologies are designed to enhance the efficacy and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain. The aforementioned concepts are elaborated upon in the article titled \u201cEverything You Need to Know Regarding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade.\u201d\n\nDanksharding\n\nThe concept of partitioning the Ethereum blockchain into smaller, more manageable segments known as \u201cblobs\u201d is referred to as Danksharding. The objective of the upgrade is to augment the capacity of the Ethereum network and diminish transaction fees through the implementation of danksharding. By enabling parallel processing of transactions and smart contracts, this partitioning method increases throughput and scalability.\n\nProto-Danksharding\n\nA feature proposed for the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade, proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) expands upon the notion of danksharding. It augments the functionality of danksharding by generating supplementary storage capacity for data on the Ethereum network. The augmented storage capacity facilitates the processing of substantial volumes of data in a more streamlined manner, thereby augmenting scalability.\n\nThe implications of proto-danksharding implementation for layer-2 rollups are substantial. Expanding the storage capacity for data structures is anticipated to result in a decrease in gas expenses linked to the utilization of layer-2 solutions, thereby providing Ethereum users with a more economical and uninterrupted experience.\n\nBy implementing danksharding and proto-danksharding, the Ethereum Cancun-Deneb Upgrade effectively tackles a significant obstacle that the Ethereum network currently encounters: scalability. These advancements enable the network to process a greater quantity of transactions and smart contracts, thereby promoting the expansion and acceptance of decentralized applications (dApps) constructed on the Ethereum platform.\n\nIn light of the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem, danksharding and proto-danksharding symbolize pivotal measures in the pursuit of Ethereum\u2019s overarching scalability objectives. Through enhanced transaction efficiency and capacity optimization, the upgrade establishes the foundation for a more scalable and sustainable Ethereum network.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade to Focus on \u201cBlobs \u201d\n\n\u201cBlobs\u201d refers to the partitioned sections of the Ethereum blockchain in the context of danksharding and EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding). The objective of danksharding is to partition the Ethereum blockchain into more manageable blobs, wherein each blob is specifically designed to execute transactions and smart contracts. These discrete blocks operate as autonomous segments within the wider Ethereum network. Danksharding establishes parallel processing by dividing the blockchain into blobs, which permits the concurrent execution of numerous transactions and smart contracts.\n\nAs previously stated, proto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, expands upon this notion by incorporating supplementary storage capacity for data within individual blobs. The augmented storage capacity facilitates the incorporation of a greater quantity of data, including smart contract code, transaction data, and related metadata. By augmenting the storage capacity, proto-danksharding facilitates the more streamlined management of increased data volumes within individual blobs.\n\nThere are numerous advantages to employing clusters in danksharding and proto-danksharding:\n\nEnhanced Scalability: By partitioning the blockchain into smaller chunks, parallel processing is enabled, which increases the capacity of the Ethereum network to process a greater number of transactions and smart contracts. This enhanced scalability contributes to the reduction of transaction fees and congestion.\n\nEnhanced Resource Allocation: Through the partitioning of the blockchain into autonomous entities, resources including storage capacity and processing power can be allocated in a more streamlined fashion. Blobs can be configured to execute particular smart contracts or process specific categories of transactions, thereby optimising the allocation of network resources.\n\nFlexibility and Modularity: The flexibility and modularity of the Ethereum network are enhanced through the utilisation of containers. This feature facilitates the modification or elimination of blobs in response to the changing requirements of the network, thereby enabling the smoother integration of future scalability enhancements.\n\nIn its entirety, the implementation of blobs in danksharding and proto-danksharding furnishes the Ethereum blockchain with a more streamlined and expandable structure. Danksharding endeavours to facilitate the expansion of storage capacity within individual blobs, thereby augmenting transaction processing velocity, diminishing transaction fees, and bolstering the development of decentralised applications on the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Recap"

First block is in! \ud83c\udf89 \u2014 terence.eth (@terencechain) March 13, 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum community celebrated the much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, a major ETH transfer caught the market's attention. A whale, an individual or entity holding large amounts of cryptocurrency, deposited 15,000 ETH on crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nThe deposit of such a large amount of ETH to exchange typically indicates a potential sale; thus, this unexpected move has led to speculation and intrigue within the crypto community, particularly as it coincides with the launch of the Dencun upgrade.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, a whale unstaked 15,078 ETH worth $60.3 million and deposited it with Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nA whale unstaked 15,078 $ETH($60.3M) and deposited it to #Binance and #Bitfinex, possibly selling to repay the debt.\n\n\n\nHe has a debt of 110M $DAI on #Spark and the health rate is 1.57.https://t.co/vSj2NxgglN pic.twitter.com/enFn91xckD \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 13, 2024\n\nWhat makes the move quite unusual is that the Dencun upgrade is expected to act as a positive catalyst for the ETH price, which leads to speculation about the whale's confidence in the upgrade's immediate impact on the market.\n\nHowever, this might not be, as Lookonchain speculates that the whale may possibly be selling their ETH holdings to repay the debt. The whale has a debt of 110 million DAI on Spark and a health rate of 1.57.\n\nCrypto data tracker, Whale Alert reports significant ETH movement before and at the Dencun upgrade launch. A total of 10,132 ETH worth $41,011,423 was transferred from an unknown wallet to Kraken exchange.\n\nHours before the Dencun upgrade launch, 18,560 ETH worth 75,324,186 were transferred from Binance to an unknown wallet. A total of 244,550 ETH worth $992,516,261 and 50,000 ETH worth $202,898,923 were also moved between unknown wallets, as well as other large transactions.\n\nAs the dust settles, the community eagerly watches to see the Ethereum Dencun upgrade's potential impact on the market and the ETH price, which remains largely unknown."

        "content": "Gnosis Chain, a proof-of-stake blockchain mirroring Ethereum, has successfully activated the Dencun hard fork, which aims to reduce transaction costs on Ethereum. At approximately 2:30 pm ET, the fork went live, introducing a dedicated data storage channel called blobs to enhance scaling on layer-2 networks.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade focuses on improving Ethereum\u2019s scalability by facilitating cheaper transactions on rollups, which leverage Ethereum for data availability. Ethereum core developers confirmed no errors were reported after the fork, and the chain is now finalizing with blobs.\n\nMartin Koeppelmann, Gnosis co-founder, stated that while rollups might not achieve sub-cent transaction fees, the Dencun hard fork on Gnosis Chain serves as a horizontal scaling solution complementing layer-2s. \u201cWe still think we need more, so we have Gnosis Chain as our horizontal scaling similar to Ethereum, and now we also do layer-2s on top of Gnosis Chain,\u201d Koeppelmann said.\n\nPhillippe Schommers, Gnosis\u2019 infrastructure director, emphasized the chain\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum. \u201cWe really want to stay exactly like Ethereum so that an application developed for Ethereum can come to Gnosis Chain seamlessly,\u201d Schommers stated.\n\nOne of the first applications leveraging layer-2s on Gnosis Chain will be Gnosis Pay, a payments network currently operating on the base layer but set to migrate to layer-2s for regulatory submission."

        "content": "NFTs based on the Ethereum blockchain have seen double-digit losses.\n\nShifting investor appetite, lack of utility, and high gas fees are key factors.\n\nPrices could begin to pick back up once money rotates out of top cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, has been on a tear. The same can\u2019t be said of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, on the network.\n\nPopular NFT collections, including DeGods, Azuki, Pudgy Penguins and Bored Ape Yacht Club, have seen double-digit losses over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum, meanwhile, is up 11% over the same period.\n\nSo what gives?\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing the first real bear market for NFTs, revealing a decoupling from their underlying asset, Ethereum,\u201d Alex Casassovici, founder of web3 streaming project Azarus, told DL News.\n\nNFT trading volumes have plummeted about 66% from last year as investors turn to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which are in the throes of yet another dizzying rally, said Transak\u2019s Gandon.\n\nIt is also likely due to rising fees on Ethereum, John Stefanidis, CEO and co-founder of crypto gaming startup Balthazar DAO, told DL News.\n\n\u201cWhen Ethereum\u2019s price rises, it can lead to increased gas fees, disincentivising NFT trading,\u201d he said.

(Dune Analytics/Dune Analytics/@LucaCS)\n\nNFT malaise\n\nNFTs have struggled to regain momentum after they became swept up in a broader crypto market sell-off in 2022, further exacerbated by waning interest in the sector.\n\nArguably, the most popular NFT collection comes from Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose floor price has gradually declined from its May 1, 2022 peak of $600,000.\n\nA floor price refers to the lowest price at which an NFT within a specific collection is currently listed on marketplaces like OpenSea and Blur.\n\nSince March 6 of this year, the value of Bored Ape NFTs has declined 13%, while DeGods, another popular project, has fallen 34% over the same period.\n\n\u201cThe current NFT narrative is more about utility NFTs you could use in blockchain games,\u201d Etienne Gandon, business development analyst at crypto on-ramping firm Transak, told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s because the market is less focused on speculation of major NFT collections, which are more about showcasing one\u2019s social status, he said.\n\n\u201cYou need a lot of new entrants to drive prices up,\u201d Gandon said. \u201cRight now, we are not at this step.\u201d\n\nThe outlook for NFTs could improve once the current surge in the broader cryptocurrency market subsides, argues Casassovici.\n\n\u201cInvestors, always in search of new avenues for growth, may find the depressed floor prices of NFTs an attractive proposition. This potential pivot could reignite interest in NFTs, presenting an opportunity for recovery and growth,\u201d he said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 1.2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $72,443\n\nEthereum has followed suit, up 1% in the same period, priced at $4,044.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

After Dencun launched, the price of ETH slumped 3.2% from $4,076 to $3,949, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nIt has largely recovered since, however, peeking back above $4,000 at time of writing.\n\nEach upgrade is intended to improve the Ethereum blockchain, including lowering fees and improving transaction speed\u2014which leads to greater value in the long run.\n\n\"Dencun will not only reduce fees to facilitate more trades and investing but also open the door for competitive peer-to-peer and commerce payments,\" Beam Wallet CEO Andy Bromberg told Decrypt in an email. \"On top of that, product maturation will make it easier for people to get into crypto and send payments. We didn't have that in the last bull run, but this time, we're set to capture the momentum for real use cases.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere are some of the important recent updates to Ethereum and how the market reacted before and after each upgrade.\n\nIn the week leading up to the highly anticipated \u201cMerge,\u201d which transitioned Ethereum from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake algorithm, Ethereum traded above $1,700, with a high of $1,779 on September 11, 2022. On September 15, the day of the \u201cMerge,\u201d Ethereum started the day trading at $1,635, falling 11% to $1,472 and steadily declining in the days that followed. By the end of September, Ethereum was $1,329.\n\nThe prior upgrade, Grey Glacier, took place on June 30, 2022; Ethereum saw a slight decrease of 3.8% from $1,098 to $1,057.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, internal milestones don't always lead to a decline in ETH value.\n\nLeading up to the London upgrade in August 2021, Ethereum traded at $2724 on August 4, rising to $2821 on August 5 when the upgrade happened and rising again 11.7% to $3151 by August 7.\n\nIn April 2021, before the Ethereum Berlin upgrade, Ethereum traded at $2429 on April 14. The price of Ethereum rose 3.5% to $2,514 on April 15, the day of the upgrade.\n\nEthereum slumped after this week\u2019s Dencun upgrade went live, although the number one proof-of-stake blockchain appeared to regain its footing later in the day.\n\n\u201cThe common phrase is that bull markets climb a wall of worry,\u201d Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy, previously told Decrypt.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on March 12. Sign up here.\n\nGM, Tim here.\n\nHere\u2019s what caught my DeFi-eye recently:\n\nLower Ethereum transaction fees are almost here.\n\nMakerDAO ups borrowing rates to over 15%.\n\nJito takes steps to stop Solana MEV bots.\n\nDencun to lower Ethereum layer 2 fees\n\nIt\u2019s about to get a lot cheaper to transact on Ethereum thanks to a new upgrade set to go live this week.\n\nCancun-Deneb, or \u201cDencun\u201d for short, contains nine different EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals.\n\nAmong them, EIP-4844 is the most highly anticipated. It promises to dramatically cut the costs of interacting on layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nLayer 2 fees will drop by a factor of 10 after the upgrade. That means swapping tokens on decentralised exchanges, which currently costs $1-2, should fall to around 20 cents, and could even go as low as a single cent on some layer 2 networks like Base.\n\nEIP-4844 will not, however, lower transaction costs on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBy reducing transaction fees, Dencun may also unlock new use cases, such as onchain gaming, generative art, and artificial intelligence, which were previously not practical due to high transaction costs.\n\nEIP-4844 ushers in Ethereum\u2019s \u201cSurge\u201d phase, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin specified in his updated network roadmap in December.\n\nThe end goal during this phase is to hit 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nAfter Dencun, Ethereum developers can start looking towards other improvements, such as letting users run Ethereum nodes on mobile phones.\n\nMakerDAO almost runs out of USDC\n\nCrypto cooperative MakerDAO is making urgent changes to its borrowing rates after the protocol\u2019s peg-stability mechanism, or PSM, almost ran out of funds last week.\n\nThe PSM lets holders of MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin redeem it for $1 worth of other stablecoins, most prominently Circle\u2019s USDC. The PSM\u2019s main function is helping to keep DAI pegged to a dollar.\n\nBecause Maker offered low borrowing rates compared to the market, DeFi users locked up assets like Ether and Wrapped Bitcoin to borrow DAI. But due to Maker locking the yield on DAI at 5%, borrowers exchanged it for USDC through the PSM, which they could use to earn much higher yields in other protocols.\n\nIn response, MakerDAO pushed through a proposal to increase lending and borrowing rates for DAI to bring them inline with the broader market.\n\nIn ~2 hours, @MakerDAO will implement some unprecedented rates moves. There\u2019s been some confusion about the cause, reasoning behind, and likely effect of these changes. Let\u2019s go through them (in that order) 1/n pic.twitter.com/FdNvbNCJ4P \u2014 PaperImperium (@ImperiumPaper) March 10, 2024\n\nIn ~2 hours, @MakerDAO will implement some unprecedented rates moves.

Let\u2019s go through them (in that order) 1/n pic.twitter.com/FdNvbNCJ4P \u2014 PaperImperium (@ImperiumPaper) March 10, 2024\n\nAccording to PaperImperium, a MakerDAO community member and governance liaison for GFX Labs, the higher rates will encourage borrowers to repay their loans, preferably by swapping USDC to get the DAI for repayment.\n\nHigher yields on DAI should also encourage DeFi users to move funds into DAI, hopefully using the PSM.\n\nJito suspends mempool after MEV bots fleece memecoin traders\n\nJito Labs, a company creating Solana staking and MEV software, has just suspended its mempool \u2014 a waiting room for transactions before they are added to a blockchain.\n\nJito Labs has decided to suspend the mempool offered through the Jito Block Engine due to negative externalities impacting users on Solana.\n\n\n\nThe decision has been made after deliberate conversations with the Jito Labs team and key Solana ecosystem stakeholders. \u2014 Jito Labs (@jito_labs) March 8, 2024\n\nJito Labs has decided to suspend the mempool offered through the Jito Block Engine due to negative externalities impacting users on Solana.\n\n\n\nThe decision has been made after deliberate conversations with the Jito Labs team and key Solana ecosystem stakeholders. \u2014 Jito Labs (@jito_labs) March 8, 2024\n\nJito Labs said in an X post that it had made the decision due to \u201cnegative externalities\u201d impacting users on Solana.\n\nThe move makes it more difficult for those running MEV bots to hit unsuspecting traders with sandwich attacks \u2014 placing transactions before and after a trade in order to extract value from price movements.\n\nSandwich attacks cost traders millions every year. They make it so traders get worse prices on their trades than they otherwise would. The effect of sandwich attacks is much more prominent in assets with low liquidity, such as memecoins.\n\nMemecoin trading volume on Solana soared last week, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours.\n\nData of the week\n\nBlockchain data platform Metrika has created a dashboard to track Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade.\n\nIt allows users to monitor the upgrade as validators switch over to the new version of the network. It also provides an estimate of the time until the upgrade is set to take place.\n\n69% of Ethereum validators are running client versions that are ready for Dencun.

The first wallet, identified as dForcenet, deposited 2.45 million ARB worth $5.05 million to Binance, and the second swapped 1.03 million ARB worth $2.13 million for USDC. Both transactions occurred on Tuesday, likely contributing to the overall decline in L2 token prices.\n\nEthereum price hit its 2024 high of $4,093 on Binance earlier today.

        "content": "While in the United States there is a debate about the feasibility of the SEC approving the spot ETF on Ethereum, in Hong Kong it is taken for granted that the regulated investment product will first appear on Chinese exchanges.\n\nAccording to some reports from local Eastern media, it seems that the monetary authorities of Hong Kong are starting to consider introducing this kind of exchange traded fund in the markets.\n\nIn the USA, the deadline for potential approval or rejection is May 23rd: given the concerns raised by President Gensler regarding the financial nature of Ethereum, speculation is beginning to arise that the ETF will be rejected in this initial round.\n\nWho will win first? The States or Hong Kong?\n\nEverything you need to know below.\n\nDeadline for the Ethereum spot ETF in the USA set for May 23: heading for rejection?\n\nAfter the approval in January of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the USA, Ethereum investors expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to soon open the doors to regulated investments on Nasdaq for the second most capitalized cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nRegarding this controversial topic, the feelings of those working in the cryptocurrency markets are currently in opposition, with some arguing that the ETF for ETH is imminent and others counteracting by saying that we are too early, but soon we will have the definitive answer.\n\nThe Bloomberg Intelligence information portal, directly picking up data transmitted by the SEC, recently reported the updated deadlines for the final response of the US federal entity, which precisely on May 23, 2024 will have to express its opinion on the approval or possible rejection of the Ethereum ETF presented by VanEck.\n\nThe next day it would be the turn of Ark Invest, and in the following weeks other Fund Managers who have previously applied for the investment product such as Hashdex, Grayscale, Invesco, BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nAlthough until a few days ago almost all the actors active in the cryptographic landscape agreed that the success of Bitcoin ETFs in America would necessarily push the SEC to approve the same type of fund for Ethereum, now things seem to be slightly different.\n\nOn March 8th, in fact, the President of the US market surveillance agency Gary Gensler expressed his hesitation regarding the need for an exchange traded fund for Ethereum in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nGensler, among other things, is not yet able to definitively express what the financial nature of Ethereum is and whether it should be classified as an unregistered security.\n\nThese uncertainties could lead to a rejection by the SEC in such a hectic moment of the market.\n\nAnyway, we remember that even when discussing the same topic on the Bitcoin front in 2023, Gensler and his henchmen had raised similar doubts, casting doubt on the usefulness of decentralized currency.\n\nEthereum spot etf approval deadline is in 2 months and Gary Gensler still won\u2019t answer if eth is a security pic.twitter.com/WccLR2wL7W \u2014 Crypto Tea (@CryptoTea_) March 8, 2024\n\nThe uncertainty conveyed by the words of the SEC chief then spilled over into investors\u2019 projections, who in the decentralized forecasting market Polymarket quoted a 30% approval of the regulated financial product by the end of May.\n\nIn January, the chances of acceptance had even doubled compared to current values, around 60%, driven by the euphoria for investments in Bitcoin.\n\nMost experts agree that this time we will not see the long-awaited Ethereum ETF in the United States, but we will have to wait for potential future developments and new deadlines.\n\nProbability chart of approval of spot ETFs on Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum ETF could land in Hong Kong before the United States\n\nDespite uncertainties currently driving the narrative of the Ethereum spot ETF within the United States territory, a much more optimistic atmosphere can be felt in Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to a local Chinese media report, then reported by the well-known reporter \u201cWu Blockchain\u201c, Chinese monetary authorities are starting to consider an ETF for the second cryptocurrency in the market, as well as examining some questions for the same type of product on Bitcoin.\n\nChinese cryptographic experts believe that the need to relaunch the Hong Kong stock market after the sharp slowdown in recent years will be the key condition that will push for approval of regulated investment vehicles on Ethereum before a positive outcome in the USA.\n\nLocal media in Hong Kong reported that 10 financial institutions have planned to apply to launch Bitcoin spot ETFs in Hong Kong, and Ethereum spot ETFs are under discussion. The industry said that if ETH products can be launched earlier than the United States, Hong Kong will have\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 11, 2024\n\nGiven the results achieved by US Fund Managers in recent days, which are attracting attention and desire in the minds of American investors, a similar product for Ethereum listed exclusively on Chinese exchanges could bring a significant flow of trading volumes to the eastern yang.\n\nRegarding the possibility of an early listing compared to Western stock exchanges, Weng Xiaoqi, COO of HashKey Group, stated verbatim that:\n\n\u201cThe delayed launch of spot ETFs by six months also means that it will take another six months for US capital to enter the market. At that point, it will have to face higher purchase costs and entry points, and will have to bear the risk of being tied up by US capital.\u201d\n\nHong Kong, if it were to make this delicate decision, could obtain the status of Asia\u2019s financial hub surpassing its American competitors and attracting significant capital in a moment of strong optimism for speculations.\n\nObviously all this would have a decidedly positive impact on the price of ETH, which, going through a phase of strong demand and contraction on the supply side, could soar in the market reaching new all-time highs around $5,000 in the coming months."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Has Crossed 4,000 mark: Will ETH Hit All-time High? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bitcoin crossed the $70,000 mark to hit an all-time high of $72,242.51 before retracing to its current price of $71,947. As BTC soared, Ethereum price also tagged along crossing the $4,000 mark, having grown by 60% in the past 30 days. The leading altcoin by capitalization achieved its all-time high of $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021. Now the price of ETH is only 18.03% away from this peak, will it meet the expectations of optimistic investors and enthusiasts and achieve this milestone?\n\nEthereum Price Market Performance\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum price is trading at $4,009 having decreased by 0.6% in the past day. However, it has experienced increasing investor activity demonstrated by the 2.18% increase in trading volume to reach $23.9 billion in the last 24 hours. Its market cap of $481.29 has positioned it on CoinMarketCap as the 2nd cryptocurrency in the market, with a circulating price of 120,093,479 ETH. The coin value has grown by 32% since it crossed the $3,000 mark on March 20, 2024, which is only 20 days ago.\n\nFactors That Could Drive Ethereum Prices Higher\n\nThere are various factors that would possibly propel Bitcoin price towards its all-time high.\n\n1. Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe anticipation surrounding the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade and the introduction of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d has sparked a wave of excitement among investors and developers within the platform\u2019s ecosystem. Scheduled to go live on March 13, this upgrade promises to reduce congestion and transaction fees significantly for Layer 2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. The upgrade tackles major scalability hurdles making Ethereum more accessible to both users and developers.\n\nAdditionally, developments in Ethereum\u2019s protocol are anticipated, where proto-danksharding will lead the way to full danksharding in future upgrades thereby enhancing its scalability potential even more. Secondly, the upgrade enhances Ethereum\u2019s security through measures such as adding new EVM opcodes while phasing out obsolete ones making it more attractive and reliable. Through infrastructure and capability enhancements like Dencun, Ethereum is likely to attract greater investor interest, fueling a bullish sentiment that could propel Ethereum to new all-time highs.\n\n2. ETH Burning and Staking Initiatives\n\nDune\u2019s data indicates that the amount of ETH locked in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake layer protocol is steadily decreasing the altcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Presently, over 31.68 million ETH, worth $126 billion, is staked on the Beacon Chain. This accounts for approximately 26.4% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply being staked and unavailable in the market, with more than 990,000 validators actively engaged.\n\nIn addition, the availability of liquid staking options like Lido has simplified the process of staking on the Ethereum network. Lido alone accounts for 31% of the overall staked Ether.\n\nFurthermore, recent data from ultrasound money reveals a substantial amount of ETH being burned in the last seven days, resulting in a reduction of Ether\u2019s circulating supply by 49,931 ETH, equivalent to approximately $200 million. This burning mechanism serves to decrease the selling pressure on the price by reducing the available supply of ETH in circulation. Ethereum\u2019s scarcity is amplified, driving up demand and potentially propelling its price to new heights.\n\n3. London Stock Exchange (LSE) plans\n\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has announced that it will accept Bitcoins and Ethereum applications for Crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). ETNs are investment products that track Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s value, allowing investors to trade similar to traditional stocks during regular trading hours.\n\nThe LSE has set up criteria for the ETNs including, the need to be physically backed and non-leveraged, meaning they have to have real assets backing them up, and they can\u2019t involve borrowing to amplify returns. Plus, they must be backed by Ethereum and Bitcoin and have a publicly available market price or value measure.\n\nSince Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is ready to support the creation of a market segment for these crypto-backed ETNs, the LSE\u2019s move opens up a whole new avenue for investors to acquire exposure to Ethereum through regulated channels and sleep have openly complied due to legal concerns it may attract significant attention from institutional investors and traditional financial players Hesitate to enter the crypto-space\n\nThis move by the London Stock Exchange adds legitimacy and accessibility to Ethereum as an economic asset, increasing demand and potentially increasing its value in the long term.\n\n4. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs)\n\nAnother force driving the Ethereum price to soar is the upcoming possibility of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, which faced a delay, spot Ethereum ETFs appear to be on a fast track to obtaining regulatory approval.\n\nThe successful deployment of spot Bitcoin ETFs since January 11 has set a precedent, indicating that a similar Ether-based product could attract substantial capital to ETH. This accelerated approval process for Ether ETFs has garnered significant attention from institutional investors, who may now look to diversify their holdings beyond Bitcoin. This shift in focus towards Ether ETFs could stabilize liquidity at higher price points and foster long-term price surges, further solidifying Ethereum\u2019s position as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTechnical Analysis of ETH\n\nThe 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) suggests a robust buying sentiment, pointing towards a favorable trend in the short to medium run. Likewise, the 200-day EMA and SMA are both displaying an upward trend, signaling a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory. Meanwhile MACD levels indicate the possibility of Ethereum price appreciation, traders should be wary of overbought conditions with the RSI (14) indicating 81.8.\n\nSupport amounts: $2546.6 and $1751.5\n\nResistance: $3829.2 and $4316.7\n\nThe attainment of $4,800 by Ethereum hinges upon a confluence of technical aspects, market dynamics, and overall market circumstances. In order to make prudent investment choices within the cryptocurrency market, traders and investors must diligently engage in comprehensive research, evaluate various sources of information, and effectively mitigate risks."

        "content": "Wed 13 Mar 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nBehind the scenes of the cryptosphere, Solana, nicknamed the \u201cEthereum Killer,\u201d is making noise. Figures reveal its rise to power, surpassing Ethereum on several fronts: daily activities, NFTs, stablecoins, etc. Vitalik Buterin and his team must step up their efforts to not lose their lead against this emerging rival.\n\nSolana: The New Queen of Blockchain?\n\nBut is the confidence of Solana\u2019s developers justified in their ambition to compete with Ethereum despite their youth? Observers remain skeptical of this fierce battle, where Solana is gaining ground on Ethereum\u2019s weaknesses (notably gas fees), while showing signs of vulnerability with its recurring outages.\n\nThe fight between these two cryptocurrency giants promises to be long and intense according to CoinTurk. Because in the kingdom of cryptocurrencies, Solana is carving out a prime spot for itself. According to the latest data, it outperforms its competitors by becoming the leading blockchain in terms of payment volumes over the past six months. With transactions totaling $1.7 trillion, Solana exceeds Ethereum ($1.1 trillion) and Tron ($869 billion).\n\nThe growth in liquidity on the Solana network is also stimulating the activity of DeFi protocols, making the platform more attractive. A new record for monthly transactions was set, while the number of daily active users now exceeds 800,000, reaching an unprecedented level.\n\nThis increased liquidity not only facilitates decentralized exchanges but also attracts DeFi projects in search of solid performances and abundant liquidity.\n\nSolana\u2019s ability to process a large number of stablecoin transactions promotes its global adoption, thus offering efficient and cost-effective financial services to users and developers.\n\nDespite its rise, Solana, the issuer of the SOL cryptocurrency, still has to catch up with Ethereum in terms of total value locked (TVL) on the network, closely followed by Tron.\n\nIn the realm of NFTs, Solana is also seeing its popularity rise with a significant increase in the total floor value of its collections. While Solana is shaping up to be a major player in the world of cryptocurrencies, the road to total supremacy is still fraught with challenges.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) sees significant price growth, with expectations of reaching new highs, backed by favorable market indicators and upcoming network upgrades.\n\nSpeculation around the approval of an Ethereum ETF in the US and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event could further boost ETH\u2019s market performance.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a Matter of When\u2019\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been among the best-performing cryptocurrencies (at least from the top 10 list) in the past several weeks, with its price surging by 60% monthly and surpassing the $4,000 level for the first time since December 2021.\n\n\n\nSome analysts and key indicators suggest that the rally could continue in the near future, meaning the asset might reach a new all-time high. The popular X user Ali supports that thesis.\n\nHe believes Ethereum\u2019s path to $5,000 \u201clooks increasingly clear as resistance thins.\u201d Ali observed a chart provided by IntoTheBlock to outline the $4,522-$4,646 as a major supply zone, where almost 600,000 addresses hold more than 1.63 ETH.\n\nThe crypto analytics platform also shows that the asset\u2019s recent price appreciation has benefited investors, with approximately 95% of holders sitting on paper profits.\n\nETF Excitement and Network Upgrades\n\nThe first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States were approved earlier this year, but such a product with Ethereum as an underlying asset is still waiting for a green light from the relevant regulators.\n\nBTC seemed to be in an excitement mode following BlackRock\u2019s application to launch an ETF, and the months leading up to the approval were highly bullish. Ethereum is currently in the same build-up zone, meaning the crypto community might witness the same rally.\n\nOn the other hand, the potential launch of a spot ETH ETF in America might lead to the same immediate \u201csell-the-news\u201d event observed after the BTC ETF approvals. Recall that the correction did not last long, with the primary cryptocurrency ascending to a new all-time high earlier this week.\n\nAnother factor that could positively impact ETH\u2019s valuation in the near future is the upcoming Dencun upgrade. It is scheduled to take place this week and focuses on increasing the scalability, efficiency, and security of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nDencun (combined from the words Cancun-Deneb) marks the beginning of \u201cThe Surge\u201d era in the network\u2019s roadmap \u2013 a process that follows the historical transition from Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to Proof-of-Stake, known as \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nThe BTC Halving\n\nLast but not least, we will touch upon the approaching Bitcoin halving, which is slated for next month. The event occurs roughly every four years and reduces the rate at which new BTC is mined.\n\nIt is a vital part of the asset\u2019s anti-inflationary nature and historically has been followed by an overall market resurgence. Recall that ETH hit an ATH of over $4,700 a year and a half after the previous halving.\n\nThose willing to dive deeper and learn the essential specifics of the halving, feel free to watch our dedicated video below:"

        "title": "Ethereum: the Dencun update is finally live! - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Today, at 13:55 UTC, or more precisely at block 8626176 of the Beacon Chain, the Dencun hard fork upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain was successfully executed.\n\nIts implementation combines two specific upgrades, known as Deneb and Cancun, where the first essentially concerns the consensus layer, while the second refers to the execution layer.\n\nDencun marks a milestone for the world\u2019s most well-known smart contract platform, and introduces improvements that could be remembered for a long time in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nBelow is everything you absolutely need to know.\n\nDencun kicks off: the long-awaited update of the Ethereum blockchain is successfully executed\n\nAfter the Shapella update dated April 2023, which started the unstaking of previously locked ETH within the Beacon Chain, Ethereum now concludes another fundamental chapter of its existence by inaugurating the Dencun hard fork.\n\nThis kind of substantial protocol change comes after the same renewal procedures have been tested on the Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky testnets, sometimes encountering quite a few difficulties.\n\nTechnically, Dencun combines two other updates that occur simultaneously on the consensus and execution levels of Ethereum (Deneb + Cancun).\n\nSeveral projects revolving around the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Optimism, Starknet, Arbitrum, and many others, have celebrated in synergy the ongoing technological revolution.\n\nThe @Ethereum ecosystem is on the brink of a game-changing upgrade with the Dencun release, featuring EIP-4844. \u2014 Optimism (@Optimism) March 8, 2024\n\nIts implementation among the various clients operating on the network is designed to improve scalability, which remains the Achilles\u2019 heel of the infrastructure designed by Vitalik Buterin even after years.\n\nOne of the most significant changes introduced with Dencun is, in fact, the introduction of the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d designed within the \u2018EIP-4844 with the aim of reducing layer-2 fees, anticipating the future revision of \u201csharding\u201d.\n\nThe update completed today, however, adds many other infrastructure improvements, celebrating various Ethereum Improvement Proposals such as EIP-1153, EIP-4788, EIP-5656, EIP-6780, EIP-7044, EIP-7045, EIP-7514, and EIP-7516.\n\nThe work of Ethereum developers, who have been planning for years to shape the protocol by adding innovations that will improve scalability, has finally been completed even though it arrived after some delay in the original schedule that saw Dencun being launched in 2023.\n\nHowever, despite encountering small hiccups along the way, the entire cryptographic community of Ethereum definitively closes the door on a brilliant era in the history of smart contracts and opens a gateway that projects us directly into the future.\n\nMany fans and active members of the ecosystem such as EthStaker and Nethermind validators, took the opportunity to celebrate together the milestone reached, joining in a livestream with their audience.\n\nWARNING: the update of the clients will happen automatically based on the provider you are relying on. Whether you are a LST staker or a simple holder, you don\u2019t have to do anything.\n\nIf, instead, you are only a staker (and have locked 32+ ETH on the Beacon Chain) you absolutely must update both the execution layer and the consensus layer, otherwise risking continuous slashing of the staked ether.\n\nThe advantages brought by Dencun to the world of layer-2: a small step towards danksharding\n\nAs mentioned, the Dencun update brings substantial benefits in terms of Ethereum scalability, introducing the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d within layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon ZkEVM, zkSync, Starknet, and many others.\n\nIn this phase, which anticipates the future implementation of sharding, with which the work of the blockchain will be fragmented, the so-called \u201cblobs\u201d have been introduced\n\nThe BLOBs are data storage spaces (as well as a new type of transaction), that replace the traditional pointers to calldata.\n\nThe blobs can be described as smaller partitions of the Ethereum database that allow to manage specific data segments improving the overall efficiency of the chain.\n\nThis translates into a significant reduction in gas costs incurred by various L2 rollups in the cryptographic ecosystem and greater transaction scalability.\n\nIt is estimated in this regard that in the coming days, when all second-level chains have updated their sequencers, the milestone of 100,000 tp/s on Ethereum will be reached.\n\nRegarding saving on fees, projections indicate a cost reduction of almost 5 times compared to the original price required to carry out an operation.\n\nWe remind you that, unlike what is erroneously described by less experienced people, the cost of transactions on the main layer remains UNCHANGED, while the advantage will be exclusively on layer-2\n\nThe much-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade is set to go live today at 13:55 UTC, bringing blob transactions and transient storage, and reducing costs on Ethereum's layer-2 networks via EIP-4844.\ud83e\uddbe pic.twitter.com/unHY8Pa6KV \u2014 Moby Media (@mobymedia) March 13, 2024\n\nAs we approach the full version of sharding with this kind of compromise improving the experience for the end user in the Ethereum rollup ecosystem, the Dencun update marks another huge advantage.\n\nIndeed, the proto-danksharding will also benefit the class of data availability (DA) protocols such as Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail, helping networks store large amounts of data at reduced costs.\n\nIn this regard, we emphasize how L2 consistently use DA projects to store their on-chain data. Dencun could make it much cheaper to move large amounts of information, opening the doors to a phase of expansion for this niche.\n\nRegarding the success of the Ethereum hard fork and the milestone achieved in the context of DA, Polygon\u2019s co-founder, Jordi Baylina, stated the following in an interview with Coindesk:\n\n\u201cPrices should go down mainly because it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand. Your supply is higher, the availability of data on Ethereum will be higher, so the price should go down.\u201d\n\nAlthough we still do not know to what extent savings could occur, we can certainly affirm that Ethereum blockchain developers will be much freer to build smoothly, without thinking too much about technical hitches caused by data costs and network fees in rollups.\n\nNow the limit for creating successful protocols on Ethereum is only imagination: the future has arrived, and it looks brighter than ever."

        "title": "Ethereum Unleashes Another Major Upgrade with the Dencun - Blockhead",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, is set to undergo another major upgrade on March 13, 2024. On this date, the highly anticipated Dencun upgrade goes live, ushering in a new era of functionality and, most importantly, scalability for the dominant smart contract platform.\n\n\"Dencun\" is a clever portmanteau of \"Deneb\" and \"Cancun,\" two separate upgrade proposals that have been meticulously combined to form a single, powerful update. Ethereum's dominance in the crypto space is undeniable. Its robust smart contract functionality has fueled the explosive growth of Decentralized Applications (dApps), revolutionizing everything from finance (DeFi) to gaming (NFTs). However, a dark cloud has loomed over Ethereum's success: scalability. Transaction fees have skyrocketed during periods of high network congestion, creating a major barrier to entry for new users and projects.\n\nThis is where Dencun comes in. This landmark upgrade represents a significant step forward in Ethereum's ongoing quest to address scalability woes and solidify its position as the premier platform for decentralized innovation.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals\n\nEthereum upgrades are usually built on the foundation of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). EIPs outline potential new features or processes for Ethereum. They also contain technical standards and specifications for the proposed changes, acting as a credible source for the Ethereum community. These allow network upgrades to be discussed and developed through the EIP process.\n\nThe EIPs are similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), as they play a central role in how changes happen and are documented on Ethereum.\n\nThe earliest Ethereum upgrade was Byzantium in 2017 which reduced block rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH and implemented new smart contract functionalities.\n\nConstantinople and Istanbul upgrades followed in 2019. These introduced multiple EIPs that enhanced Ethereum\u2019s efficiency, optimized transaction fees and made the network more supportive of Layer 2 chains.\n\nThe transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) was started with the launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020 and completed with the Merge in 2022. This allowed for staking of Ether, improving Ethereum\u2019s environmental friendliness and reducing the issuance of ETH.\n\nA full history of all Ethereum upgrades can be seen here.\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade\n\nDencun comes with a series of technical improvements designed to optimize Ethereum's performance with added benefits for Layer 2 networks on the blockchain.\n\nThe central feature of the Dencun upgrade is the introduction of proto-danksharding, which is contained in EIP-4844. Proto-danksharding significantly reduces data storage costs for Layer 2 rollups.\n\nThis is accomplished through \"data blobs,\" which are holders for large amounts of data associated with Layer 2 transactions. The improvement that data blobs bring is that unlike traditional transactions, they are not executed on the main chain. Instead, they are stored briefly on the main chain with a data reference included in the transaction. Blobs are available for 18 days then dropped from the network. This decreases the computational burden on the main chain, potentially reducing the gas fees for L2 rollups.\n\nBefore Dencun, Layer 2 networks had to submit all transactions to the main chain in one chunk. This limited scalability as only a specific amount of data could be handled by the main chain. After the Dencun upgrade, L2 chains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and others can use data blobs to slash transaction fees on their chain.\n\nBenefits for Ethereum Users & Traders\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade brings several benefits to users and traders alike. According to statistics from IntoTheBlock, the gas fees for DEX swaps are projected to reduce on Aribitrum from $2.02 to $0.4. On Optimism, fees are projected to reduce from $1.42 to $0.28, and on Base from $0.58 to $0.01.\n\nUsers will also benefit from improved scalability with proto-danksharding allowing the Ethereum blockchain to handle a significantly higher number of transactions per second, reducing congestion and improving overall performance.\n\nLayer 2 Blockchains like Optimism and Arbitrum will also see increased adoption with improved compatibility and performance, as more developers and users seek scalable alternatives to Ethereum's mainnet. Layer 2 solutions already complement Ethereum's mainnet by offering scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization. This synergy strengthens the overall Ethereum ecosystem and fosters innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other dApp sectors.\n\nLayer 2 solutions also provide a flexible scaling solution that can dynamically adjust to network demand, ensuring smooth operation even during periods of high congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nImpact on Ethereum\u2019s Price Action\n\nWith Ethereum breaking the $4,000 price barrier and the continued growth of Layer 2 solutions, demand for ETH is projected to grow.\n\nA look at the on-chart indicators highlight the sustained inflow of capital and strong buying pressure, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings. This could see ETH hit a new all-time high, following in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) steps.\n\nETH/USDT on TradingView (Daily Timeframe)\n\nEthereum's Dencun upgrade represents another significant milestone in the blockchain's journey towards scalability, efficiency, and mass adoption. This upgrade will ensure Ethereum is poised to offer a better user experience while maintaining its position as a leading blockchain platform. Moreover, the enhanced compatibility with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum opens up new possibilities for scalability and innovation, benefiting both Ethereum and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Buckle up, crypto world \u2013 the future of decentralized applications is about to get a whole lot brighter."

        "content": "Ethereum prices soared even though it lacked the demand from ETFs that Bitcoin has.\n\nProfit-taking activity as ETH crosses $4k could commence, according to the age-consumed metric.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] accumulation addresses were at 171% and 80% unrealized profit respectively, according to data that CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn the past three months, Bitcoin saw enormous institutional demand due to the ETFs. While Ethereum does not have ETFs, it still saw strong demand.\n\nBitcoin witnessed a faster rate of accumulation than Ethereum\n\nThe inflows to accumulation addresses, in USD terms, have rapidly gained pace for Bitcoin in 2024. The ETF approval in January had a huge impact on this metric.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was unable to match the pace of demand for Bitcoin.\n\nSimilarly, the whale addresses holding Bitcoin saw a sharp uptrend since 2021. This has only sped up even more in 2024. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw a more steady uptrend since 2021 without sudden bursts of acceleration.\n\nEven without institutional demand to the same degree as Bitcoin, Ethereum was able to hold its own in terms of demand and popularity. It underlined that whales still saw the largest altcoin as a safe alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nRealized price refers to the price of the Bitcoin or Ethereum at which they were last moved on average. The accumulation addresses were at 92.5% unrealized profits on Bitcoin, and 183% unrealized profits for Ethereum.\n\nThis highlighted an especially bullish case for Ethereum. Demand on the scale that Bitcoin is witnessing right now could propel ETH prices into the stratosphere, which should have investors jumping for joy.\n\nExamining the accumulation trends across the network\n\nAMBCrypto looked at the wider BTC and ETH network activity to contrast CryptoQuant\u2019s dive into the accumulation addresses. The Santiment data above showed that the daily active addresses of ETH were about half that of Bitcoin since early February.\n\nThe Ethereum age-consumed metric saw a huge spike on the 11th of March when the prices burst past the $4k psychological resistance. This pointed toward profit-taking activity.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nOn the other hand, the mean coin age of ETH has trended upward over the past four months. In contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s mean coin age has fallen since the second half of February.\n\nOnce again, this suggested that holders were booking profits on BTC, while they were mostly happy to let Ethereum run higher. Despite this inference, the large age-consumed surge warranted some caution from investors."

Some observers saying that Bitcoin's price behavior suggests that institutional investors are leading market activity. The gains followed a record day of ETF inflows in terms of dollars and Bitcoin data tracked by bit.

Bitcoin is at around $72,000 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time and the Coin Desk 20 index is relatively flat at 2736 Ethereum Blockchain has successfully completed the DCU upgrade. The upgrade is designed to usher in a new era of cheaper fees for the growing array of auxiliary networks that operate on top of Ethereum known as layer two roll ups. The DK upgrade has been planned for years but it was delayed due to some engineering concerns. Since then, developers have tested the package on three separate networks and most of those ran smoothly. Ether is at just below $4000 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. And the US government has concluded that no NFT specific legislation is needed. A 112 page government study found that current intellectual property laws are adequate to deal with concerns about copyright and trademark infringement associated with FTS.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have cleared the $70,000 and $4,000 psychological levels, respectively.\n\nThis development has pushed the Fear and Greed index to extreme greed as the indicator points to 81.\n\nMajor altcoins seem to have stopped in time as they move sideways, devoid of volatility.\n\nThe cryptocurrency bull rally that started in January 2023 is going strong, with Bitcoin clearing old all-time highs (ATH) at $69,000 and Ethereum clearing the $4,000 psychological level. This cycle has caused many altcoins to grow by multiples in short durations. But as BTC dominance reaches April 2021 levels, what\u2019s next for crypto markets?\n\nAlso read: El Salvador is sitting on $84M profit from its Bitcoin holdings\n\nCrypto market sentiment screams cautiousness\n\nThe Fear and Greed Index (FGI) stands at 81, which indicates that the crypto markets are in \u201cextreme greed\u201d conditions, where potential corrections could erupt due to profit-taking.\n\nThe FGI ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), reflecting crypto market sentiment. The lower range, aka extreme fear, signals that the markets are oversold, while the upper limit indicates that a potential market correction could be around the corner.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index\n\nBitcoin dominance on the rise\n\nBitcoin dominance, the ratio of BTC\u2019s market capitalization vs. the rest of the crypto market, is currently hovering around 54.05%. In less than two months, Bitcoin dominance has risen roughly by 8 percentage points and is fast approaching a tipping point of 56.62%. This level is the midpoint of the 39.62% to 73.63% range formed in the first two quarters of 2021.\n\nTypically, a declining Bitcoin dominance suggests that investors are interested in altcoin opportunities and vice versa. The recent spike suggests that altcoin profits or new capital could be moving back to BTC. Additionally, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) accepting BTC was a factor that helped Bitcoin\u2019s price to break above $70,000.\n\nBTC Dominance\n\nThe rise in BTC dominance, while bullish for Bitcoin, could translate into a potential correction for altcoins.\n\nEvaluating potential altcoin market reset\n\nA hypothetical scenario that could occur in the next few days is that altcoins lose momentum as BTC's dominance continues to rise. This outlook could push investors to book partial profits, causing altcoins to slide lower.\n\nDogwifhat (WIF), Pepe coin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and other meme coins that noted a raging rally in the past few weeks are already correcting.\n\nEventually, this profit-taking scenario could spread to major altcoins like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Wordlcoin (WLD), and Fetch.aI (FET), pushing investors to convert their unrealized gains into profits.\n\nMeme coin performance\n\nOther considerations\n\nWhile a potential correction could be brewing, some altcoin exceptions could trend higher. These altcoins could rebel against the dominant trend and potentially rally with Bitcoin.\n\nRead more about trending altcoins here - link\n\nHere are the top three altcoins that could rebel against a potential correction and rally higher:\n\nArbitrum (ARB): The Arbitrum Gameathon, which began on Monday, has already caused gaming tokens to surge in the past week. This event will end on March 18, which means it could continue to influence gaming-related altcoins. Worldcoin (WLD): The Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem could see a massive uptrend due to the upcoming Nvidia AI conference, which will take place from March 18 to 21. Ethereum Dencun upgrade: This much-awaited upgrade will be implemented on March 13, making prices of ETH-related altcoins like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), LidoDAO (LDO) and others to shoot up.\n\nAlso more: Arbitrum Arcade launch could fuel narrative for crypto gaming tokens"

        "content": "ETH might face mild resistance but a climb to $5,000 looked almost certain.\n\nRising confidence in the altcoin reinforced the bullish prediction.\n\nThe price of Ethereum [ETH] might soon hit $5,000, according to analyst Ali Martinez. But the altcoin has to break through the supply wall between $4,522 and $4,646.\n\nA supply zone is a cumulation of buy orders. In this instance, the intention is to create a barrier that prevents the price from going down. Martinez, who used IntoTheBlock\u2019s data, noted that 600,000 addresses bought 1.63 million ETH around that region.\n\nThe season is already here\n\nTherefore, the path was now a resistance for the cryptocurrency as some of the buyers might try to breakeven. While this might slow down Ethereum\u2019s bullish strides, the climb to $5,000 looked almost certain.\n\nAMBCrypto came to this conclusion after analyzing the Liquidation Heatmap. In simple terms, the Liquidation Heatmap predicts price levels where large-scale liquidations might occur.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, liquidation occurs when a trader\u2019s position is forcefully closed due to price fluctuations. It could also happen as a result of insufficient margin balance to cover the funding fee.\n\nFrom our analysis of HyblockCapital\u2019s data, large scale liquidations might occur if ETH hit $4,205. However, a successful close above this price could see the value climb higher.\n\nFor instance, the chart below showed that the altcoin might not face any major resistance below $4,310. Furthermore, if ETH rises past 4,860, the run to $5,000 could become very easy.\n\nBearish aggression is fuel for ETH\u2019s rally\n\nAnother metric AMBCrypto assessed to check the likelihood of a rally was the Funding Rate. The Funding Rate is the difference between the price of a perpetual contract and the spot price of a cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to Santiment\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s aggregated Funding Rate was 0.068%. The positive Funding Rate implied that ETH was trading at a premium perp price above the index value.\n\nThe high reading of the metric alongside the rising ETH price suggests that short are aggressive. Unfortunately, their aggression is not being rewarded. Therefore, ETH\u2019s price action is potentially bullish.\n\nBeyond the happenings in the derivatives market, we also checked out the active addresses. At press time, the number of active addresses on the Ethereum network was 537,000. This was a significant increase from what the amount was on the 10th of March.\n\nThe rise in active addresses indicate growing interest and confidence in ETH. While it also means that the network has gotten healthier, traders might also view it as bullish signal.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nIn conclusion, a combination of the metric evaluated aligned with a price increase. However, ETH might experience some pullback as it targets a new all-time high.\n\nBut indicators showed that potential retracement might not last long."

SKALE occupies the 154th spot on CoinMarketCap, with a market valuation of $568 million. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has climbed by 7%, and its annual growth rate has skyrocketed by more than 183%. Following the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, SKALE has emerged as a top altcoin choice for investors.\n\n5. Bitrock (BROCK)\n\nBitrock (BROCK), an Ethereum sidechain leveraging IBFT 2.0 Proof of Authority (PoA), boasts almost negligible native transaction fees. This blockchain stands out for its high-speed, secure, and scalable framework. Additionally, it introduces an innovative decentralized exchange (DEX) mechanism.\n\nPresently, Bitrock\u2019s value has hit $0.2824, marking an impressive 15.55% increase today.

        "title": "Approval And Denial: Ethereum ETF Is A 'Sell The News Event' - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Experts are currently arguing about the likelihood of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Ethereum ETF. Among others, Samson Mow, known as the \u201cBitcoin Maximalist\u201d and founder of Jan3, a company focused on accelerating the nation-state adoption of BTC, voiced strong doubts and criticism.\n\nMow\u2019s Critique: Dissecting The Ethereum ETF Dilemma\n\nSamson Mow\u2019s analysis of the Ethereum ETF situation is rich with insight and skepticism, offering a detailed critique that touches on regulatory inconsistencies, ETH\u2019s unique characteristics, and the speculative nature of its market dynamics. Mow\u2019s statement on X (formerly Twitter) serves as a critical assessment of what the approval\u2014or denial\u2014of an ETH ETF might mean for the broader crypto landscape.\n\n\u201cThe Ethereum ETF is not a sell the news event, it\u2019s a sell the shitcoin event. Meaning sell anytime. I would say odds are 50/50 for approval, but both approval and rejection are mega bearish for Ethereum,\u201d Mow asserted, setting the tone for his argument against the Ethereum ETF. His remarks underscore a deep-seated skepticism toward ETH\u2019s valuation and its position within the regulatory framework of the SEC.\n\nMow further delves into the regulatory conundrum faced by the SEC, stating, \u201cThe SEC footgunned themselves by approving ETH futures (along with BTC futures), which means rationally they need to approve the ETH spot ETF for the same reasons as the BTC one.\u201d This observation highlights the precedent set by the SEC\u2019s previous actions, which Mow views as complicating the decision-making process regarding the Ethereum ETF.\n\nAddressing the complexities introduced by Ethereum\u2019s design, particularly its staking mechanism and its pre-mine, Mow articulates a series of rhetorical questions: \u201cWhat kind of commodity generates a yield? What kind of commodity ETF prints 70% of its supply out of thin air? What kind of commodity ETF tweaks its own \u2018monetary\u2019 policy at will (uLtRasOuNd m0nEy)?\u201d These questions not only challenge conventional definitions of commodities but also point to the difficulties in categorizing Ethereum within existing regulatory and investment frameworks.\n\nMow\u2019s critique extends to the speculative nature of ETH\u2019s price movements based on Bitcoin\u2019s ETF success story, attributing recent gains to \u201chope of approval\u201d rather than genuine capital inflows. Even in the case of an approval, Mow predicts an ETH price downturn. Why? Because analogous to the spot Bitcoin ETF launch, there\u2019s the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) which holds 2.9 million ETH. These would then become redeemable, 2.4% of the current supply.\n\nTherefore, he predicts a no-win situation for Ether, explaining that \u201cIf a Ethereum spot ETF isn\u2019t approved, the speculators will sell. If an spot ETH ETF is approved, the existing holders will sell, and no one is going to buy because it\u2019s structurally defective.\u201d\n\nThe Odds Of Approval Have Declined\n\nAs reported by Bitcoinist, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF expert Eric Balchunas has recently drastically changed his odds for a spot Ethereum ETF approval in the US. \u201cYeah our odds of ETH ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%,\u201d Balchunas shared, reflecting a cautious stance by the SEC\u2019s historical positions and current signals from the agency.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $4,003.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "With bitcoin hitting new highs, it\u2019ll likely reach the US$100,000 milestone before 2024 is out - The Conversation",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies are surging again. Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high of more than US$72,000 (\u00a356,300), pushing past the level of circa US$69,000 where it turned back during its last bull phase in late 2021.\n\nOther top cryptocurrencies like ethereum and solana have reached their highest prices in three years, on the back of a run that has been going since the autumn. The value of the whole cryptocurrency market has raced up to US$2.6 trillion, triple what it was worth at the beginning of 2023 and not far off its previous US$3 trillion peak.\n\nMuch of this run has occurred at a time when the US dollar has been strengthening against other currencies (though it has fallen in the past couple of weeks). This can often be a time when cryptocurrencies get weaker, so it shows how strong they have been lately.\n\nMany other fiat currencies around the world have been losing value against the US dollar during this period, so bitcoin reached all-time highs in many of them long before it finally took out its high in the US currency.\n\nSo what has contributed to this explosion in prices and where is the market going for the rest of 2024?\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nA major driver for this appreciation in prices has been the US authorities\u2019 approval in January of an investment vehicle known as an exchange-traded fund or ETF for the general or \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin market. An ETF is an easy way for the average saver to get exposure to an asset, since they buy shares in the vehicle, usually through their financial advisor, rather than having to go to the trouble of buying the underlying asset.\n\nA total of 11 bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, and their daily trading volume has now exceeded US$10 billion \u2013 driven by frontrunners Blackrock and Fidelity Investments. This demonstrates the large interest from traditional market participants, and as the spot ETFs become more mature, their providers will offer more promotional material and education to get more customers onboard.\n\nBitcoin/US$ price\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is always adapting and innovating, and one possible future innovation is the offer of option contracts on the new spot ETFs. Options allow traders to hedge their bets on whether the crypto market will go up or down, and would likely attract even more new money into the space.\n\nHowever, US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just postponed a decision on this innovation until late April. Some experts think approval may take longer than that as it is unclear which regulatory body would be responsible for policing this new class of derivative contracts.\n\nThe bitcoin halving\n\nOne feature of the bitcoin system which was built in at the beginning is that, roughly every four years, the rewards to companies using arrays of computers to create or \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin get cut in half.\n\nThe last halving took place in May 2020, where miners went from receiving 12.5 bitcoin for each unit of work they do to 6.25 bitcoin. The next is due to take place on April 19, cutting the reward down to 3.125 bitcoin.\n\nBecause each halving means less new bitcoin coming on to the market, they have coincided with strong price appreciation in the cryptocurrency. What isn\u2019t clear is whether this is already priced in and therefore not actually the reason price is going up.\n\nOne theory is that the institutions behind the spot ETFs are buying aggressively now because they know there will be less bitcoin on the open market once the halving takes place.\n\nEthereum prospects\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto market could also be boosted by spot ETFs for the ethereum cryptocurrency system in the coming months. At least ten firms, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have applied to launch them and the SEC has until May to make a decision.\n\nWhereas the online ledger that underpins bitcoin, known as its blockchain, has been seen largely as a store of value, ethereum has become the leading blockchain for developers to write applications using this technology.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that most cryptocurrencies should be treated differently to bitcoin, as financial instruments known as securities rather than as more straightforward commodities. This adds complexity to the ethereum ETF approval process. If the US authorities were to decide it was the case, it would mean that ETFs couldn\u2019t buy ethereum from crypto exchanges until those exchanges had received approval to trade it as a security.\n\nWhile that uncertainty continues, ethereum could be boosted by the so-called Dencun upgrade (also known as Duncan or EIP-4844). Ethereum has competition from other blockchains such as solana and avalanche due to its relatively slow transaction speed and high costs.\n\nIt already completed its first major step in a long-term plan to reduce costs and cope with many more users (known as scalability) when it transitioned in 2023 to a different system for verifying transactions known as proof of stake. The Dencun upgrade, which goes live on March 13, will further improve scalability by making data storage more efficient on the network, while also lowering transaction fees.\n\nWhere next\n\nPredicting cryptocurrency prices is not for the faint-hearted. The market is very volatile, and often exceeds expectations when it goes up or down. The behaviour of individuals determines market prices and, as Isaac Newton put it, you can \u201ccalculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people\u201d.\n\nHowever, the majority of commentators expect crypto prices to keep rising over the coming months. Election years tend to be good for investments in general, while a second Trump administration would probably create a more favourable regulatory environment for crypto assets (as would a Rishi Sunak victory in the UK, however unlikely that seems at present).\n\nAs bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream and integrated with traditional assets, it isn\u2019t inconceivable that it could hit US$100,000 in 2024 \u2013 an extraordinary feat for a invention that was worth nothing as recently as 2009."

        "content": "Stablecoin volumes on Solana grew significantly over the last six months.\n\nDaily activity on the Solana network surged while floor value of Solana NFTs spiked.\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed a large uptick in interest in its ecosystem over the last few weeks. This has led to a large surge in stablecoin volumes on the network as well.\n\nVolumes on the rise\n\nAccording to recent data, Solana became the leading blockchain for stablecoin transfers at the time of writing, surpassing other chains in settlement volumes over the last six months.\n\nDuring this period, Solana recorded $1.7 trillion in transactions, outpacing Ethereum with $1.1 trillion and Tron with $869 billion.\n\nThis heightened liquidity within the Solana ecosystem not only facilitates smoother decentralized exchange operations but also attracts decentralized finance (DeFi) projects seeking a platform with robust performance and ample liquidity.\n\nThe network\u2019s ability to process a substantial number of stablecoin transactions enhances its overall adoption, as users and developers are drawn to a blockchain that offers efficient and cost-effective financial services.\n\nMoreover, the diverse use cases supported by high stablecoin volumes, including trading, lending, and yield farming, contribute to a dynamic and active Solana ecosystem.\n\nLooking at the activity\n\nIn terms of daily activity, Solana surpassed Ethereum and was slowly catching up to Tron. However, in terms of TVL (total value locked) on the network, it was seen that Ethereum reigned supreme followed by Tron and Solana.\n\nThis showed that despite a surge in activity, Solana has a long way to go before it could go toe to toe with Ethereum in the DeFi sector.\n\nNFT metrics\n\nIn terms of the NFT sector, it was seen that Solana NFT collections witnessed growth. The overall total floor value of Solana NFTs surged significantly over the last few days.\n\nHowever, the same level of growth wasn\u2019t observed in terms of sales volume for these collections. This indicated that despite the rising prices of the NFT collections, the number of NFT trades remained low implying that many addresses were choosing to hold their collections instead of trading them.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $150.93 and its price had grown by 1.75% in the last 24 hours. Coupled with that, the volume at which SOL was being traded at had also grown by 15.23% during the same period.\n\nHowever, the RSI at which SOL was trading had declined suggesting a slowdown in bullish momentum."

While there was an expectation of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) immediately after the Bitcoin ETF announcement, the enthusiasm has recently faded after Bloomberg ETF analysts significantly reduced the probability of a Spot Ether exchange-traded fund approval in May, down to 30% from as high as 70%.\n\nAnalysts at crypto trading platform Blofin state that a rejection may not have a significant impact on Ethereum price.

In January, the analyst believed there was a 70% chance of ETF approval by May. Balchunas\u2019 colleague James Seyffart\u2019s prediction was at 60%-65% at that time.\n\nIn the absence of meaningful engagement from SEC officials with the ETF applicants, the initial optimism has waned. Experts continue to compare the Bitcoin Spot ETF and its preparation to the regulator\u2019s decision on the Ethereum ETF.\n\nThe regulator has held meetings with Coinbase and Grayscale, but there are no public comments. This has added to the uncertainty.\n\nAnalysts at crypto trading firm Blofin state that there are three factors that could result in the SEC\u2019s rejection of a Spot Ethereum ETF:\n\nThe Merge, a shift of the altcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nPrice manipulation risk that accompanies PoS consensus.\n\nSecuritization risk.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF approval may have no bearing on ETH price\n\nAnalysts highlight that there was a surge in whale activity and supply distribution of Bitcoin in the weeks leading up to the regulator\u2019s decision on the ETF. However, an on-chain analysis of Ethereum paints a different picture. Instead of consistent accumulation, large wallet addresses have taken profits and likely capitalized on ETH holders\u2019 enthusiasm and optimism of an ETF approval.\n\nWhale action is lacking in the sense that there is no race among large wallet holders to increase their holdings of the altcoin\u2019s supply.

On the one hand, analysts have identified the return of cash liquidity to the crypto market as a factor boosting Ethereum price gains. This has brought volatility back to Ether, adding to the potential for growth.\n\nThe gains in Ethereum price are likely a reflection of Bitcoin\u2019s rally to a new all-time high and the optimism among market participants. Ethereum price is inching closer to its peak in the ongoing cycle and analysts argue that a Spot Ethereum ETF approval could fast track the process. However, a rejection of the ETF applications may not result in a significant pullback since the altcoin\u2019s price depends on more variants than the decision by the regulator.\n\nAdriano Feria, a crypto analyst and trader, said that Ethereum price could recover from a rejection after a minor pullback.\n\nWhat's coming to crypto markets in the next 2-3 months:\n\n\n\n- $ETH continues to gain momentum both in $USD and relative to $BTC. $ETH bulls simply don't care if ETFs are not approved as early as May, and they will use this time to accumulate.\n\n\n\n- L2 fundamentals will pop hard after\u2026 pic.twitter.com/w2DIP24wbT \u2014 AdrianoFeria.eth \ufe0f (@AdrianoFeria) March 11, 2024\n\nDCinvestor also argues Ethereum ETF approval or rejection may have no impact on the altcoin\u2019s price in the near term."

        "content": "The Dencun upgrade is aimed at reducing fees to help L2s grow further.\n\nETH\u2019s price action remained bullish, as did market sentiment.\n\nThe wait for Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] much-talked-about Dencun upgrade is coming to an end, as it is scheduled to take place on the 13th of March.\n\nThe upgrade will bring several changes to the blockchain, which will be especially beneficial for the L2s.\n\nSince the update is around the corner, AMBCrypto planned to check how ETH was doing ahead of the launch.\n\nAll about Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will be the next major update for Ethereum after the Shapella upgrade that was pushed back in 2023.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Dencun upgrade will execute two upgrades simultaneously on Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layers. The primary focus of the upgrade is to drastically reduce fees to aid Layer-2s growth.\n\nThis will be made possible as the developers will activate a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), which is named proto-danksharding.\n\nEthereum\u2019s fees spike\n\nWhile developers prepared to push the new upgrade, Ethereum\u2019s network fees increased.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Artemis\u2019 data revealed that ETH\u2019s fees gained upward momentum and spiked on the 5th of March. As a result, ETH\u2019s revenue also rose on the same day.\n\nA possible reason behind this surge could be the hike in ETH\u2019s gas price, which stood at 64.39 Gwei per Ycharts.\n\nThough things looked optimistic in terms of captured value, Ethereum\u2019s network activity had dropped. This was evident from the decline in its Daily Active Addresses chart since the 29th of February.\n\nBecause of the drop in addresses, ETH\u2019s Daily Transactions fell as well.\n\nNonetheless, Ethereum\u2019s price action favored the bulls, as it was up by more than 9% in the last seven days. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,034.42 with a market capitalization of over $484 billion.\n\nThe king of altcoins also remained a buzzing topic of discussion in the market as its Social Volume remained high.\n\nAdditionally, its Weighted Sentiment spiked, suggesting that bullish sentiment around the token was dominant at press time.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nApart from that, the technical indicator MACD displayed a bullish upper hand in the market. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered an uptick, hinting at a further rally.\n\nHowever, ETH\u2019s price had touched the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands at press time, which indicated a price correction."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s wallet address is experiencing an unprecedented surge to an all-time high, according to data from The Block\u2019s data dashboard. Notably, the blockchain has recorded more usage, specifically non-voting user transactions, than several major competitors combined. Solana\u2019s activity surpasses that of Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Tron, and Avalanche collectively. This remarkable milestone highlights Solana\u2019s growing prominence and widespread adoption in the blockchain space.\n\nDespite SOL still being 70% away from its previous ATH, the blockchain is attracting massive institutional interest. For instance, Pantera Capital, a major player in the crypto space, is reportedly considering a substantial investment of $250 million in SOL from FTX. This move is seen as a strong bullish signal for the blockchain.\n\nSolana's Wallet Surge Surpass Ethereum & Beyond 3\n\nEven with FTX holding 10% of the circulating supply, equivalent to $8 billion, industry insiders suggest that this might be the beginning of potential growth. With influential companies like Pantera expressing confidence in higher SOL prices, investors are paying attention, and following their lead could potentially lead to substantial gains.\n\nKeeping up the momentum, the Solana meme coin market is booming with a nearly $7 billion valuation, representing around 10% of the total market. Ryan Selkis of Messari highlighted Solana\u2019s standout features, such as a seamless trading experience highlighted by tools like Phantom and Backpack, DEXscreener trading integration, minimal fees, and rapid transaction processing. In a market cluttered with speculative tokens, these elements collectively distinguish the blockchain, setting it apart from the rest.\n\nSolana: Blockchain Powerhouse\n\nThe platform\u2019s appeal is not limited to its advanced functionalities but also to its cost-effectiveness. Solana\u2019s \u201cdirt-cheap\u201d gas fees attract a significant influx of retail money, making it an attractive choice for those seeking efficient transactions without breaking the bank. Despite experiencing occasional outages, the network is thriving and expanding, further solidifying its position in the crypto space.\n\nAdditionally, the platform has surpassed the combined daily transactions of several other major chains. As of the latest available data from Solana Floor on March 7, 2024, the network continues to assert its dominance in transaction volume, further solidifying its reputation as a blockchain powerhouse."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price predictions for the coming week! - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Capital flowed out of Bitcoin, suggesting that the price might dip below $69,000.\n\nDespite increasing gains for holders, ETH\u2019s price might hit $4,500 soon.\n\nTop cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple [XRP] have had a great start to March, despite earlier predictions that the month could be bearish for the market.\n\nFor instance, Bitcoin rallied to a new All-Time High (ATH) as it zoomed past $72,000 on the 11th of March,\n\nEthereum, which was once lagging, has been catching up. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of the altcoin, ETH\u2019s price gained 8.59% in the last seven days.\n\nThis performance ensured that the value rose above $4,000. Then, there is XRP, which has been a subject of controversy following Ripple\u2019s long-standing lawsuit with the U.S. SEC.\n\nBut in the last 24 hours, XRP seemed not to care about its predicaments as its price pumped 18% and almost tapped $0.74. But can the cryptocurrencies maintain this momentum in the coming week?\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nBitcoin\u2019s impressive performance since the year began has been connected to the surge in institutional interest through ETFs.\n\nBut the past few days have seen a spike in retail interest, indicating that the bull run might already be here.\n\nHowever, a look at the Hodler Net Position Change revealed that the high-flying price might take a chill pill. Employing Glassnode\u2019s data, we noticed that the metric had dropped into negative territory.\n\nIf the Hodler Net Position Change was positive, it would have meant that investors were accumulating BTC. But the metric being at -31.531 BTC means that holders were cashing out.\n\nIf investors continue to book profits, then Bitcoin\u2019s price might decrease.\n\nA considerable price that it could hit in the coming week could be below $69,000 which was a key resistance area. However, traders might need to watch out for institutional inflow.\n\nShould inflows from the ETFs hit new highs, then Bitcoin\u2019s price might rally to another ATH.\n\nEthereum price prediction\n\nFor Ethereum, AMBCrypto considered the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.\n\nAt press time, the 30-day MVRV ratio was 19.30%, which means that if all ETH holders sell their tokens, they would make an average gain of 19.30% profit.\n\nIn a bull market, this reading is considerably low and might imply that the altcoin was undervalued. For instance, the bull market of 2016-2017 saw the MVRV ratio rise as high as 81.6%.\n\nIn 2021, the metric also surged higher. With this state, ETH\u2019s price might rise higher in the coming week, and a 10.22% hike to $4,500 might be plausible.\n\nAnother reason for this could be a decline in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance. Should this be the case, ETH might get a big share of the redistribution, which could drive the price upwards.\n\nXRP price prediction\n\nXRP seems to be enjoying the capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Previously, AMBCrypto reported how the token was struggling to rise past the $0.62 resistance.\n\nAs of this writing, the price had declined to $0.69 after initially hitting $0.71. When we considered the 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), we observed that the metric slid.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s XRP\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nDips like this indicate a sudden movement of previously idle tokens. Concerning the price, it could indicate distribution. If this continues, XRP\u2019s price might decrease to $0.65.\n\nHowever, the metric showed signs that a rising slope could be in the works. A confirmation of this slope might invalidate the bearish bias, and drive XRP toward $0.75.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "Fresh spot BTC ETFs are on the cards in the Far East.\n\nA spot ETH ETF approval might be seen first in Hong Kong, given the current developments.\n\nThe introduction of a Bitcoin [BTC] spot ETF is no longer a novel development in the United States, and it is anticipated that a spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF will soon follow suit.\n\nNevertheless, institutions in Hong Kong are currently strategizing to submit applications for both BTC and ETH ETFs. This move has the potential to attract additional capital inflow for these assets.\n\nHong Kong eyeing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs\n\nLocal reports from Hong Kong suggest that institutions in the region are actively seeking approvals for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to the reports, there is a prevailing sentiment among institutions and traders that they are lagging, especially with the United States having already approved 11 spot BTC ETFs.\n\nHowever, there are indications that this push for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in Hong Kong may expedite the approval process for spot Ethereum ETFs, potentially putting them ahead of the United States in that aspect.\n\nThe report also notes ongoing serious discussions surrounding spot ETH proposals.\n\nTen institutions have submitted applications for spot BTC ETFs. If these applications receive approval, they could contribute to the ongoing institutional fund inflow that Bitcoin is currently experiencing.\n\nFurthermore, the early approval of spot ETH applications not only brings more funds into the Ethereum market but may also influence discussions on the approval of ETH ETFs in the United States.\n\nThe current state of U.S. spot BTC ETFs\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s examination of key metrics for the spot Bitcoin ETF on Coinglass revealed significant growth since receiving approvals.\n\nAnalyzing the flow data shows predominantly positive inflows, with only three days standing out as exceptions.\n\nThe largest outflow occurred on the 1st of March, totaling over $311 million, while the highest inflow was recorded on the 5th of March, reaching over $965 million.\n\nChart analysis indicates that the highest volume in the ETF\u2019s history occurred on the 6th of March, reaching almost $13 billion. As of press time, the volume stood at around $9.1 billion.\n\nMoreover, the spot BTC ETF\u2019s market cap has surged to over $58 billion, with Assets under Management (AUM) exceeding $55 billion at the time of the report.\n\nThese metrics collectively illustrated the notable growth and increased investor interest in the spot Bitcoin ETF market since its approvals.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum cross into new price zones\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at the daily timeframe for Bitcoin and Ethereum revealed that both assets have achieved new price levels. Bitcoin\u2019s chart showed a 2.7% increase, with the asset trading at over $70,000 at press time.\n\nThis marked the first time in over two years that BTC has reached this price level. Also, it was occurring a few months after the approval of spot ETFs in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has broken into the $4,000 price range at the time of writing. The chart showed a gain of over 3%, placing it slightly above $4,000.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, this marked the first time since 2021 that Ethereum has reached such a price level.\n\nBoth assets are currently in the early stages of their bull runs, and the potential approval of spot ETFs in Hong Kong could further propel their prices to new highs."

        "content": "With the stellar demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs within the first two months of launch, market analysts are hoping for a similar approval of spot Ethereum ETF. Top industry players like BlackRock and Fidelity have been flexing their muscles to get a spot Ether ETF in the market, however, the overall optimism surrounding this seems to be waning down.\n\nWhat Are the Roadblocks to Ethereum ETF Approval?\n\nBlofin Analysis has indicated that the likelihood of spot ETH ETFs receiving approval is considerably reduced due to factors such as the negative implications of the PoS mechanism, risks associated with price manipulation, and concerns regarding securitization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn its analysis, BIoFin explains that nearly 55% of ETH supply (about 66 million coins) is held by 1,041 addresses with over 10,000 ETH each, while retail traders own less than 45%. These major holders can heavily influence ETH network upgrades due to their stake in voting rights under PoS. The SEC has also expressed concerns regarding the same in its public filings stating:\n\n\u201c\u2026Are there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d\n\nIn contrast, BTC holders lack voting rights and their distribution is more even, with whales owning around 40% of BTC supply and about 2,100 whale addresses as of March 2024, reducing the potential for price manipulation compared to ETH.\n\nThis #Ethereum ETF cycle feels like the opposite of #Bitcoin ETF approval odds at the moment. The more we see/hear (and don't see/hear) the less optimistic I become. We're ~73 days from the deadline and there really seems to be little to no movement https://t.co/N6OpM870XF \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) March 11, 2024\n\nEthereum Options Data Doesn\u2019t Support\n\nIn the options market, potential leads have emerged. Following the announcement of the spot BTC ETFs application, both BTC and ETH far-month option skewness experienced a notable surge, peaking in November 2023. Conversely, the announcement of the spot ETH ETFs application did not prompt option traders to factor in additional bullish sentiment. The rise in far-month skewness in February is likely attributed to liquidity return rather than the ETF news, reports BioFin.\n\nHowever, the report highlights that the final decision on the approval of spot ETH ETFs will not hinder the potential breakthrough of ETH price, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn another development, Blackrock has appointed Matt Kunke, formerly a research analyst at GSR, as their Digital Assets Product Strategist. This move underscores Blackrock\u2019s efforts to enhance its cryptocurrency ETF offerings for its customers.\n\nThe ETH price has once again surged past its crucial milestone of $4,000 and eyeing further gains as the community prepares for the Dencun upgrade ahead.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "Ethereum Rainbow Chart March 2024 Update and How to Read It? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "Confused by the ever-changing price of Ethereum (ETH)? The Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be your guide! In 2024, this chart has become an essential tool for both novice and seasoned investors navigating the volatile landscapes of cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThrough this update, we delve into the nuances of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, offering a step-by-step guide on interpreting its colors and patterns. Moreover, we will uncover where Ethereum stands on this chart as of March 2024.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a vibrant visualization tool designed for long-term predictions of Ethereum\u2019s price movements. Inspired by the Bitcoin (BTC) Rainbow Chart, it combines a logarithmic growth curve with color bands to easily depict Ethereum\u2019s different market sentiments and valuation phases.\n\nThis approach facilitates the observation of exponential growth in cryptocurrency values, which might not be as perceptible on a standard linear scale.\n\nThe working of a Rainbow Chart\n\nLogarithmic scale: The chart uses a logarithmic scale, which shows proportional relationships in the data rather than absolute changes. This is useful for assets like Ethereum that can experience rapid price increases.\n\nColor bands: Each color band represents a different market condition, from \u201cbuy\u201d zones to \u201csell\u201d zones. The colors can also be seen as sentiment indicators, from fear at the bottom to greed at the top. The idea is to counteract emotional investment decisions by providing a visual cue.\n\nDynamic adjustments: Lastly, the chart adjusts as new price data becomes available, potentially shifting the regression model and the positions of the color zones.\n\nBeginner\u2019s guide to reading the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to interpret Rainbow Charts, here\u2019s a general guide to help you navigate it:\n\n1. Dark red zone (maximum bubble territory)\n\nThis extreme area signals that the asset is highly overvalued, and the risk of a significant correction or crash is elevated. Selling and taking profits in this zone could be wise to protect against potential losses.\n\n2. Red zone (overbought)\n\nThe red zone suggests that Ethereum is in an overbought condition. This means that the price has been pushed to levels that may not be sustainable in the near term.\n\nIn traditional market analysis, an overbought condition is often followed by a price correction as traders start taking profits, leading to an increased supply of ETH for sale.\n\n3. Dark orange zone (FOMO building up)\n\nIn the dark orange zone, buyers are dominating the market, and a sense of fear of missing out (FOMO) is building up. This indicates an intense buying pressure where new investors are entering the market.\n\nWhile this can lead to short-term price surges, it also increases the risk of a sudden market correction if sentiment changes or early investors start cashing out.\n\n4. Light orange zone (balanced market)\n\nThe light orange zone suggests that the forces of supply and demand are relatively even, leading to more stable prices. In a balanced market, neither buyers nor sellers have clear dominance, and the price of Ethereum moves within a more predictable range.\n\nThis stability can be seen as an opportune time for investors to reassess their positions without the pressure of extreme volatility. It might also indicate a period of consolidation before the next significant price movement.\n\n5. Yellow zone (hold)\n\nThe yellow zone implies that while there might not be strong signals to buy more ETH or to sell existing holdings, maintaining one\u2019s position could be advantageous in the long run.\n\nIt\u2019s a watchful wait stance, where investors keep a close eye on market developments without making immediate, drastic changes to their portfolios.\n\n6. Light green (still cheap)\n\nIn the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, the light green zone signifies a phase where ETH is considered relatively cheap. This zone indicates that the price is lower than the historical average, potentially offering investors a favorable entry point before an anticipated increase in value.\n\n7. Green zone (buy)\n\nOften considered the \u201cideal\u201d zone, the green band suggests that Ethereum is fairly valued. Prices in this range are thought to offer a good balance of risk and reward for long-term investors. Buying during the green phase is often recommended for those looking to accumulate Ethereum for the long haul.\n\n8. Blue zone (undervalued)\n\nAs prices move down into the blue zone, Ethereum is considered undervalued. This zone suggests that market sentiment may be overly bearish, and prices could represent a significant discount.\n\n9. Dark blue zone (basically a fire sale)\n\nThe bottommost bands signal that Ethereum is significantly undervalued, resembling a \u201cfire sale\u201d with meager prices. They present the best buying opportunity, offering the potential for substantial long-term gains as the market recovers.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart: March 2024\n\nIn March 2024, ETH lies in a light orange zone. This suggests a balanced market. So, the decision to buy, sell, or hold depends on an investor\u2019s strategy, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of considerations for each action:\n\nBuy ETH\n\nLong-term perspective : If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in the fundamental value and future growth of Ethereum, buying during a balanced market could be a strategic move.\n\n: If you have a long-term investment horizon and believe in the fundamental value and future growth of Ethereum, buying during a balanced market could be a strategic move. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): This period might be ideal for implementing or continuing a DCA strategy. Here, you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the market condition. This approach can help mitigate volatility and lower the average purchase price over time.\n\nSell ETH\n\nProfit-taking : If you have already achieved significant gains and the market\u2019s balanced state meets your target sell conditions, it might be an opportune time to realize some profits. This is particularly relevant if you anticipate increased volatility or have short-term investment goals.\n\n: If you have already achieved significant gains and the market\u2019s balanced state meets your target sell conditions, it might be an opportune time to realize some profits. This is particularly relevant if you anticipate increased volatility or have short-term investment goals. Portfolio rebalancing: The balanced market condition could be a good opportunity for portfolio rebalancing. If Ethereum\u2019s recent performance has skewed your investment portfolio away from your desired asset allocation, selling a portion of your ETH holdings to rebalance your portfolio can help manage risk.\n\nHold ETH\n\nWait-and-see approach : In a balanced market, holding can be a wise choice, especially if you are unsure about the market\u2019s direction. This strategy is suitable for investors who are not affected by short-term fluctuations.\n\n: In a balanced market, holding can be a wise choice, especially if you are unsure about the market\u2019s direction. This strategy is suitable for investors who are not affected by short-term fluctuations. Stability: If your analysis suggests that the market is likely to remain stable or improve, holding your position allows you to avoid potential transaction costs and taxes associated with selling, and you remain positioned to benefit from future growth.\n\nDecision factors\n\nMarket analysis : Continuously monitor the market for any new trends or data that might affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Use a combination of technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis.\n\n: Continuously monitor the market for any new trends or data that might affect Ethereum\u2019s price. Use a combination of technical, fundamental, and sentiment analysis. Risk tolerance : Assess your risk tolerance. If potential short-term market downturns lead to uncomfortable stress levels or financial strain, adjusting your position might be prudent.\n\n: Assess your risk tolerance. If potential short-term market downturns lead to uncomfortable stress levels or financial strain, adjusting your position might be prudent. Investment goals: Align your actions with your investment goals. Whether you\u2019re investing for long-term growth, income, or speculation, let your goals guide your decision-making process.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart Use-Cases for Investors\n\nWhen considering investing in Ethereum, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart can be incredibly helpful. It provides insight into past price movements and potential future directions.\n\nBy analyzing different colored price ranges over time, investors can identify opportune moments to enter or exit positions. Essentially, the chart highlights areas where significant buying or selling activity is likely to occur, aiding decision-making processes regarding Ethereum investments.\n\nLimitations of Rainbow Charts\n\nLike any analytical tool, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart has its limitations. Here are some of the key limitations to consider:\n\nHistorical data dependency : The Rainbow Chart relies heavily on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future price movements accurately.\n\n: The Rainbow Chart relies heavily on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future price movements accurately.

No timing guidance: The chart does not guide timing, making it challenging to execute buy or sell decisions at optimal moments.\n\nEthereum Rainbow Chart Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nAdvantages of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nOnce you understand how the Ethereum Rainbow Chart works, let\u2019s explore why it\u2019s such a valuable tool:\n\nAccessible Understanding: This chart offers a straightforward way to comprehend market sentiments and track Ethereum (ETH) price movements. Its use of layers and colors makes it accessible, even for those new to technical analysis.\n\nComparative Analysis: It serves as a valuable comparative tool, enabling users to analyze market trends and price levels across various cryptocurrencies. This comparison can provide insights into Ethereum\u2019s performance relative to other digital assets.\n\nPredictive Insights: Incorporating the Ethereum Rainbow Chart into your analysis can aid in predicting future price movements based on historical market cycles. Observing patterns in price behavior can provide investors with a better understanding of potential future trends.\n\nDisadvantages of the Ethereum Rainbow Chart\n\nDespite its visual simplicity and utility, there are limitations to consider when using the Ethereum Rainbow Chart:\n\nNo Guarantees: No tool, including the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, can reliably predict future prices in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. While it may provide insights into past trends, it cannot guarantee future outcomes.\n\nLimited Historical Data: Unlike the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, which extends back to 2010, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart has a more limited period. This shorter historical data may result in less accurate predictions and analyses.\n\nExternal Factors Not Considered: The chart does not account for external factors such as government regulations, economic conditions, or technological advancements. These factors can significantly impact Ethereum\u2019s price movements but are not reflected in the rainbow chart.\n\nEcosystem Changes: Changes within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as upgrades or protocol changes, are not accounted for in the rainbow chart. These developments can have substantial effects on Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics but are not captured within the chart\u2019s framework.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Bitcoin and Ethereum Rainbow Charts?\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart and the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart differ in the price ranges they represent and their time frames. This difference is logical given Ethereum\u2019s historically lower value compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart dates back to 2010, providing a more extensive historical perspective, while the Ethereum counterpart records price performance only from 2015 onwards.\n\nBoth charts visualize historical price trends, aiding investors in identifying potential support and resistance levels. However, they should not serve as the sole basis for investment decisions, requiring additional analysis and consideration of various factors.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe Ethereum Rainbow Chart is a helpful indicator, but remember, it\u2019s not a crystal ball. Cryptocurrency remains a volatile market. By understanding the Rainbow Chart\u2019s logic and combining it with your research, you\u2019ll be better positioned to navigate the ever-shifting world of Ethereum. So, are you ready to unlock the secrets of the Rainbow? Dive in and get charting!"

        "content": "As the crypto community eagerly awaits the approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a concerning silence looms over issuers. The lack of communication from the regulator has raised doubts about the possibility of Ether ETF approvals by May.\n\nRemarking on the same, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas took to X and noted,\n\n\u201cYeah our odds of eth ETF approval by May deadline are down to 35%.\u201d\n\nHe further added,\n\n\u201cI get all the reasons they SHOULD approve it (and we personally believe they should) but all the signs/sources that were making us bullish 2.5mo out for btc spot are not there this time.\u201d\n\nThis shed light on the market uncertainty, revealing the downgrade chances of Ether ETF.\n\nVarious influencers with diverging perspectives\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegarpgh, Balchunas elaborated,\n\n\u201cThe main thing is the fact that we\u2019re 73 days from the final deadline, and there\u2019s been no contact or comments from the SEC to the issuers. That\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Balchunas highlighted SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s stance on Ether, suggesting it could influence the decision-making process.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Gensler thinks Ether is a security. He would not want to approve it unless he thought it to be a commodity like Bitcoin. All of this little stuff adds up.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store also took to X, and expressed his confusion regarding the SEC\u2019s decision,\n\n\u201cIf SEC isn\u2019t engaging w/ prospective issuers on their filings, that\u2019s clearly a negative sign.I\u2019m looking for a logical take on the \u201cwhy\u201d here.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Matt Corva, the general counsel at ConsenSys, suggested, that the denial of an ETH ETF could yield positive outcomes in the long run. He expressed,\n\n\u201cIf ETH goes, they get crushed by their political handlers and they have no arbitrary ground left to battle against other coins \u2014 this is a great thing,\u201d\n\nWhat lies ahead?\n\nOn 6th March, key industry players like Coinbase and Grayscale held talks with SEC officials regarding rule changes for spot Ether ETFs. Despite initial optimism, analyst Balchunas, echoing insights from VB Capital\u2019s Scott Johnsson, presents a cautious view.\n\nLooking ahead, the U.S. election day stands as a critical juncture for regulatory shifts. While uncertainties persist, Balchunas remains steadfast in his belief in an eventual approval for spot Ether ETFs."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could reach $80K or higher after recording a new peak of $72,800 on Binance.\n\nEthereum price could recover its $4,868 ATH, 20% north as markets ready for Dencun Upgrade.\n\nRipple price could hit $0.8000 this week, a 10% climb as XRP bulls show strength.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price continues to show strength, moving in unchartered territory amid institutional FOMO (fear of missing out). This is reinforced by the fact that the majority of BTC holders are not selling. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is also showing strength, holding above $4,000 while Ripple (XRP) price outdoes itself with double-digit gains.\n\nAlso Read: Large corporations, major wirehouses gearing up to buy Bitcoin: Bitwise\n\nBitcoin price eyes $80,000\n\nBitcoin price could make a 10% climb to the $80,000 psychological level after a bullish breakout above the $70,000 threshold. Markets remain broadly optimistic seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) position, still ascending despite BTC being massively overbought. Notice the RSI has not confirmed that BTC is ripe for selling.\n\nIf bullish momentum increases, Bitcoin price could extend north to the forecasted $80,000 target. This being the first time the market is witnessing this kind of buying frenzy among institutional players for an asset with limited supply, so much so that a bull market appears to have commenced months ahead of the BTC halving, just how far the price can go remains anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nWe\u2019ve never seen #Bitcoin reach a new all-time high before the halving.\n\n\n\nWe have never seen billions of institutional money flow into #Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThere has never been so many states looking to pass pro #Bitcoin laws .\n\n\n\nDo not blink. History is happening right before your eyes. \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) March 11, 2024\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart\n\nConversely, if traders begin to book profits on the gains made so far, Bitcoin price could pull back, first losing the immediate support at $69,000. An extended fall would plunge BTC price back into the supply zone between $62,278 and $65,618. A break and close below the midline of tis order block at $64,044 would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: Next target for BTC is $80K after LSE and MicroStrategy announcements\n\nEthereum price could reclaim its all-time high\n\nEthereum price is up almost 85% since the start of the year and does not show any signs of stopping. ETH bulls maintain a strong presence in the market, represented by the deep green shade of this histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO). The RSI is also northbound, showing rising momentum with the primary trend growing stronger as shown by the volume indicator.\n\nEnhanced buyer momentum could see Ethereum price extend the gains past the $4,500 threshold before reclaiming its $4,868 peak, levels last tested on November 10, 2021. Such a move would denote a 20% climb above current levels.\n\nETH/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the other hand, if seller momentum increases, Ethereum price could retract to provide another possible buying opportunity around the $3,602 support level.\n\nAlso Read: ETH beta plays heat up this week as Ethereum Dencun Upgrade goes live on Gnosis\n\nRipple price eyes $0.8000 milestone\n\nRipple price has gone parabolic, gaining nearly 20% over the last day. This has seen XRP price record a multi-month high of $0.7440. Judging from the RSI position, there is still more room before the payments token can be considered overbought. Also, the AO histogram bars remain in positive territory, flashing green to show the bulls are in the lead.\n\nEnhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price nick the $0.8000 psychological level, or in a highly bullish case, extend the gains to shed a zero and tag the $1.0000 key milestone. This would denote a 38% move north above current levels.\n\n\n\nXRP/USDT 1-week chart\n\nOn the flip side, a drop below the $0.6421 support is likely to invalidate the bullish thesis, giving the bears a chance to recover the market.\n\nAlso Read: XRPLedger\u2019s AMM activation could have a positive effect on Ripple, XRP"

        "title": "Ethereum Holds Above $4,000 As Dencun Upgrade Begins! Will ETH Price Trigger A Correction? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) options traders are preparing for potential short-term declines in price just one day after the price impressively surged past $4,000, reaching its highest point since late 2021. Following Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge above the $73,000 threshold, ETH has been gaining traction, aiming to maintain its position above the $4,000 mark. Nonetheless, the ongoing Dencun upgrade, a significant development subsequent to the Merge, has ignited worries about a possible retreat in ETH prices. This cautious outlook is further boosted by a variety of on-chain metrics indicating a bearish sentiment.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Sparks Bearish Worries\n\nIn the past four hours, [ccpw id=60480] has experienced a significant liquidation event totaling over $5 million, with $3.2 million of this coming from the liquidation of bearish positions by sellers. Notably, with BTC\u2019s price now affecting ETH\u2019s price dynamics, even a slight downturn could trigger a long squeeze in ETH\u2019s market. Moreover, numerous analysts anticipate a market correction for ETH following the completion of the Dencun upgrade, drawing parallels to the correction observed after the Merge.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock reveals a notable increase in the Netflow metric for ETH, with the current trading volume reaching 85.29K ETH. This indicates that the volume of Ethereum entering exchanges has begun to exceed the outflow, leading to an increase in exchange reserves. Such a trend underscores the growing likelihood of an imminent price correction in the near future.\n\nAdditionally, the one-month call-put skew for Ether, a key indicator of market sentiment in the options arena, has shifted into negative territory, suggesting a prevailing preference for puts \u2014 options that hedge against potential price declines. Similarly, the sentiment for the 60-day period has shown a tilt towards put options. In contrast, the outlook for the 90-day and 180-day periods continues to be optimistic, as per the cryptocurrency options data from Deribit monitored by Amberdata.\n\nFurthermore, alongside the adverse risk reversals, QCP Capital has observed a minor decrease in ETH spot-forward spreads, in stark contrast to the higher spreads seen in Bitcoin (BTC) markets. This disparity indicates that a significant drop in ETH spot prices might trigger an additional tightening of forward spreads as leveraged long positions undergo liquidation.\n\nHowever, the Dencun upgrade, following last year\u2019s Shapella, introduces significant enhancements to Ethereum, notably with EIP-4844, or \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d drastically reducing Layer 2 fees. It aims to lower transaction costs dramatically, from a dollar to just a cent, enhancing user experience. Additionally, Dencun brings in ephemeral data blobs to reduce storage costs and network congestion, storing data temporarily for about 18 days, thereby boosting Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\n\nConsequently, given the current bullish market outlook, Ethereum may not see any notable price adjustments or declines from its present position. Should any pullbacks occur, they are likely to draw in further buying interest.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nSellers attempted to drive Ether down to the breakout point of $3,600, yet the pronounced tail on the candlestick indicates robust purchasing at lower prices. As a result, despite facing rejection at $4,100, ETH price quickly rebounded and is now aiming for a retest of that level. Currently, ETH price trades at $4,066, surging over 2.1% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nETH/USD 4-hour Chart On TradingView\n\nThe climb above the key $4,000 mark has set the stage for a potential increase to $4,500, which might present a slight obstacle. However, surpassing this resistance level could send the ETH/USDT pair towards $4,900.\n\nThe recent sharp rise has sent the RSI into significantly overbought territory, suggesting a need for caution. Currently, the RSI level trades at 64 level. For sellers to plunge the current bullish trend, they must pull the price beneath the 20-day EMA at $3,989. Doing so could trigger a corrective period for the pair."

        "content": "Ethereum exceeds $4,000 as Dencun day lands\n\nToday is the day of the long-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Dencun will reduce Layer 2 transaction fees and involve \u201cblobs\u201d and \u201cProto-dank sharding\u201d. On Monday, Ethereum punched above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021. This new cycle high has happened even in the face of the perceived diminishing likelihood of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the SEC.\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nToday is the day of the long-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Dencun will reduce Layer 2 transaction fees and involve \u201cblobs\u201d and \u201cProto-dank sharding.\u201d On Monday, Ethereum punched above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021. This new cycle high has happened even in the face of the perceived diminishing likelihood of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the SEC.\n\nOver the past week, the probability of the Ethereum ETF being approved has been declining even as the asset has continued to soar. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, estimates the odds of the 23 May deadline being approved now stand at 30%. This is a decline from his 70% January estimate. Balchunas\u2019s pessimism, he claims, stems from the lack of comments and interaction from the SEC regarding the filings so far. The Bitcoin ETFs took multiple edits and refilings along with meetings with the regulator to get the process over the finish line. In an attempt to aid the process, Coinbase met last week with the regulator to advocate for the spot ETF. They demonstrated the potential lack of manipulation and the strong correlation to the futures ETF. However, we are still 71 days away from the 23 May deadline. This is a lifetime in crypto, but maybe not in the traditional finance world where filings, regulatory bureaucracy and politics are involved.\n\nRegardless of the ETF\u2019s approval, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals are improving each day. According to The Block, active addresses have increased to over 500,000 \u2013 their highest since December 2022. Last week also saw Ethereum\u2019s revenue breach $200 million for the first time since May 2022. Today\u2019s Dencun Upgrade also aims to make layer 2s more usable. The Block also estimates the Dencun Upgrade will considerably lower DEX swap gas fees. Aribitrum\u2019s fees will be reduced from $2.02 to $0.4 and Base\u2019s will be reduced significantly from $0.58 to $0.01. The declining costs will potentially drive more cost-conscious participants onto Ethereum Layer 2s and away from Ethereum\u2019s arch-nemesis \u2013 Solana. With both the overall crypto market outlook and Ethereum fundamentals improving, maybe denial of the Ethereum ETF wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world for the asset. 71 sleeps to go."

        "content": "Wed 13 Mar 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Ariela R.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is about to undergo a major transformation with the Dencun upgrade. This long-awaited upgrade promises to revolutionize the scalability and efficiency of the Ethereum network, paving the way for significant changes in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n#Traders beware! #Ethereum price may encounter turbulence ahead of #Dencunupgrade, warns QCP Capital.\n\n\n\nStay ahead, strategize, navigate wisely through the storm. Knowledge is power!https://t.co/hz9rhQp19S \u2014 Coin Edition (@CoinEdition) March 13, 2024 The price of Ethereum (ETH) could be disrupted before the Dencun update\n\nDencun Upgrade of Ethereum: A Promise of Increased Scalability\n\nAt the heart of the Dencun upgrade is the \u201cproto-danksharding.\u201d This is a technical innovation aimed at significantly reducing transaction costs for layer 2 blockchains.\n\nThis major advance could resolve the scalability issues currently hampering Ethereum. It would indeed allow the crypto network to potentially process up to 100,000 transactions per second. Such capacity would propel Ethereum to the status of an ideal cryptographic platform.\n\nWhat are the implications for crypto investors and developers?\n\nThe increase in transaction processing capacity and the reduction in costs generated by the Dencun upgrade could attract a wave of new developers and users towards the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThis increased adoption would stimulate demand for ETH, positively influencing its price. Moreover, the upgrade could promote more diversification of the Optimism (OP) ecosystem and better availability of ZK-Rollups applications.\n\nEthereum Price: Contrasting Prospects\n\nAnalysts like QCP Capital are predicting a correction in the ETH price as the upgrade approaches. They highlight the increase in short positions on Ethereum options. This indicates some investor apprehension about a possible price drop. This trend could be explained by a desire to hedge against risks associated with altcoin investments.\n\nMarket indicator analysis also reveals mixed signals.\n\nOn one hand, the risk reversal for ETH has become negative. This suggests concern about a price drop.\n\nOn the other hand, the spot-forward spreads for Ethereum have slightly decreased. This denotes some confidence in the price stability.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $4,047.\n\nDespite short-term uncertainties, the Dencun upgrade represents a crucial milestone for Ethereum.

Bitcoin (BTC, +4.5%) was able to successfully move past the $70k resistance level, and now trading near the $72k mark. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH, +4.7%) moved past the $4k level and now trading above this level. The broader market is in the green, while the fear and greed index continues to be in the \u2018Extreme Greed\u2019 signifying a very strong investor sentiment.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin's Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) volumes continue to uplift market sentiment, driving the token to an all-time high amid increased adoption. Despite awareness of potential pre-halving corrections, investors maintain optimism regarding the token's price trajectory. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin's Hull Moving Average has transitioned into a 'Buy' sentiment, coinciding with significant gains in Litecoin, Ripple, and STX. While uncertainties linger around Ethereum ETFs, the token is witnessing gains as part of the broader market surge, showcasing resilience and positive momentum. Investors remain attentive to developments in this dynamic market landscape.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cInstitutional involvement, exemplified by BlackRock's large bitcoin holdings and the SEC's approval of ETFs, is reshaping the bitcoin story. As BlackRock's ETF outperforms MicroStrategy's holdings, institutional interest is driving Bitcoin's rise. MicroStrategy remains committed to strengthening its Bitcoin reserves, reflecting the company's growing belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's current rise to $72,500 underscores its market dominance, with technical indicators pointing to a bullish trend. Resistance levels at $73,824, $76,749 and $79,904 pose challenges, while support levels at $67,154, $64,861 and $62,192 offer cushions against downside. Despite potential overbought conditions, Bitcoin's break above $70,000 and bullish candlestick patterns indicate an upward trajectory, with a target above $73,800. The 50-day EMA at $66,860 reinforces this bullish sentiment and suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin above $72,200.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's price surpassed $72,000 on Monday, creating a new ATH at $72,800. The largest cryptocurrency now has a total market cap of $1.4T, surpassing silver to become the world's eighth most valuable property. MicroStrategy purchased an additional 12,000 BTC for approximately $821.7 million in cash. This takes MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings to over 205,000 BTC. The crypto market continues to demonstrate remarkable growth and adoption worldwide.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, the crypto market remained bullish as BTC surged to a new all-time high of $72,800 and ETH reached a new yearly high. Alts also experienced significant upside moves. BTC's stability at this high level indicates strong underlying strength, with futures open interest also rising sharply. This stability in BTC led to 5-10% gains in altcoins, with Layer 1 tokens leading the charge. ETH nearly touched $4,100 and is currently consolidating around that level. Additionally, the ETH/BTC pair is showing major support, suggesting that ETH may take the lead in the near term. The next key level for ETH to watch is $4,380.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Blasts Off! ETH Price to Hit New ATH This Week?\n\nStory Highlights The Dencun upgrade for Ethereum is here, aiming to significantly reduce transaction fees on Layer 2 networks.\n\nA key feature of Dencun is the use of \"blobs\" to store data for Layer 2 networks, reducing storage costs and congestion.\n\nHope is that the Dencun will lead to substantial improvements in transaction fees and network performance.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fans rejoice as the long-awaited Dencun upgrade finally arrives today, promising to shake up Layer 2 (L2) networks and potentially boost ETH prices beyond $4,000.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another update \u2013 it\u2019s a major milestone in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, promising significant improvements in efficiency and scalability. But how exactly will Dencun shake things up?\n\nKey Features of the Dencun Upgrade\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s Shapella upgrade, Dencun brings in several improvements to make Ethereum faster and handle more transactions. One exciting feature is the introduction of ephemeral data blobs with EIP-4844, nicknamed \u201cprotodanksharding,\u201d which aims to significantly lower L2 transaction fees.\n\nDencun\u2019s goal is to drastically reduce transaction costs, with fees dropping from $1 to just one cent. Even smaller transactions, which previously cost cents, can now be completed for a fraction of a cent. This cost reduction aims to greatly improve the user experience, surpassing previous upgrades like the September 2022 \u201cMerge.\u201d\n\nBesides fee cuts, the Dencun upgrade introduces blobs, a new way to store data for Layer 2 networks. These blobs store data for a shorter time, about 18 days, saving costs and making Ethereum more scalable.\n\nAlso Read: Top Reasons Why Ethereum Might Be The Best Bet in 2024 For Atleast 3x-5x Profits\n\nCommunity Enthusiasm and Developer Involvement\n\nTim Beiko, an Ethereum core developer, expressed excitement on Twitter about the upcoming arrival of Dencun. Developer engagement has been strong, with many client teams releasing Dencun-compatible versions that include important performance and stability improvements.\n\nLess than 24h before Dencun .oO!\n\n\n\nSince the announcement, many client teams have shipped performance & stability improvements.

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin praised this move, highlighting its importance for the Ethereum community.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has been activated on the @gnosischain mainnet!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc21\ud83e\udd89\ud83d\udc21\n\n\n\nNext \u27a1\ufe0f Ethereum Mainnet pic.twitter.com/S6GKhfe3TX \u2014 Gnosis Chain \ud83e\udd89 (@gnosischain) March 11, 2024\n\nFee Reductions Ahead!\n\nAdding the positive vibe, IntoTheBlock\u2019s analysis predicts significant fee reductions of at least 80% for major Ethereum Layer 2 solutions after the Dencun upgrade. Optimistic estimates indicate that fees for depositing USDC on platforms like Aave could drop to as little as $0.0091, marking a remarkable 27-fold decrease. Additionally, substantial improvements in data blob functionality are anticipated for OP stack chains.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we explore the rise in meme token speculation and how the upcoming Dencun upgrade will impact Ethereum fees.\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/xVh8pz1Pxh \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 9, 2024\n\nIs There Hope for the Future?\n\nWhile the exact impact of these changes remains uncertain, the Ethereum community is optimistic about the upgrade\u2019s potential benefits and eagerly awaits its rollout.\n\nIn summary, the upcoming Dencun upgrade is a significant milestone for Ethereum, demonstrating its commitment to scalability, efficiency, and innovation. As the activation date approaches, excitement within the Ethereum community continues to build.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETF Approval Dims as SEC Stalls: What are the Odds Now?"
