        "content": "Public comments are due in the next 21 days, and rebuttals are due in 35 days.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced in a filing submitted Monday that it will be extending its decision timeline on BlackRock\u2019s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal. Aside from Blackrock, the regulator has also delayed its decision on another ETF proposal by crypto firm Fidelity.\n\nThe SEC can delay decisions up to three times before arriving at a final decision, with the first deadline in May. According to the filing, the SEC is opening the approval of Ethereum ETFs to public comments to \u201caddress the sufficiency\u201d of the proposal.\n\nIn particular, the SEC has raised concerns on the \u201cnature of the underlying assets\u201d held by the iShares Ethereum Trust. Comments for both Fidelity and BlackRock are due in the next 21 days, and rebuttals are due in 35 days.\n\nThe SEC framed its concerns on the matter with the following question:\n\n\u201cAre there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulations?\u201d\n\nBoth BlackRock and Fidelity filed for their spot Ethereum ETFs in November last year, with other firms like Franklin Templeton, Ark 21Shares, VanEck, and Grayscale soon following suit. However, the SEC announced a delay last January and extended the initial 45-day review period, citing more time to read the proposals. The SEC had also approved ETFs on the same day, except this was for Bitcoin.\n\nSEC Chair Gensler was also quick to temper potential criticisms and clarify that the SEC has no ulterior motives and that the delays \u201cshouldn\u2019t be read to be anything other than that.\u201d\n\nAn ETF is a pooled investment security that can be purchased or sold in the same manner as an individual stock, though it differs from a mutual fund in that the latter only trades once a day after market close.\n\nAnalysts and market commentators are ambivalent about when the final decision will be handed and whether BlackRock\u2019s ETF will get the green light. The policy environment in the United States could affect the decision and the relative success of crypto-based ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF currently holds a record-breaking $10 billion in assets under management.\n\nMeanwhile, enthusiasm for the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs has spurred the price of ETH, which is currently up 7.1% at the $3,700 level, according to data from CoinGecko."

        "title": "Beyond ETH: 3 Cryptos That Are a Better Bet Than Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Over the last 15 years, cryptocurrencies have existed. And as long as these digital assets have proliferated, they\u2019ve done so with volatility.\n\nThe entire market capitalization of the crypto sector peaked right around $3 trillion during the height of the last hype-driven mania in 2021. However, a so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019 ensued in the last couple years, with the sector bottoming out around $900 billion. At the time of writing, the entire market is moving quickly toward a $2.5 trillion valuation, with plenty of momentum to break through to new highs.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is certainly one of the top tokens leading the way higher, alongside the king of crypto Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Yet, there could be other more lucrative options in this sector for long-term investors seeking even greater upside. Let\u2019s dive into three such tokens.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana Crypto currency Gold Solana SOL. Close up on white background Blockchain concept 3d rendering\n\nSource: pasit chomying / Shutterstock.com\n\nA well-known \u201cEthereum Killer,\u201d Solana (SOL-USD) might be an excellent option to consider instead of Ethereum.\n\nThis proof-of-stake network is built on an intriguing proof-of-history consensus mechanism. Essentially, that means Solana uses time stamps to speed up the sorting of transactions. Doing so allows the network to process multiples of the typical order flow at a fraction of the cost.\n\nTherefore, this speed and cost advantage are reasons most investors like Solana. The network has become synonymous with the NFT space, given the fact that many transactions are for smaller dollar amounts. Ethereum\u2019s network, which can charge hefty gas fees for its usage, isn\u2019t as well-suited for such purposes. Hence, the real-world utility Solana has been able to generate.\n\nAdditionally, while Ethereum focuses more on gradual upgrades, Solana is known for innovative solutions such as their Saga phone and successful crypto strategies. These high-growth strategies make this token more compelling for those seeking outsized gains, at least during this bull market rally.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) crypto coins on a black background\n\nSource: Skorzewiak / Shutterstock\n\nIt was only in 2020 when Ava Labs launched Avalanche (AVAX-USD). This new blockchain offers seamless automated contract executions through its smart contract support. Also, Avalanche focuses on enhancing scalability and usability. This allows the blockchain to handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nOne of the best features investors love about Avalanche compared to Ethereum is its relative cost-effectiveness. Like Solana, Avalanche offers transaction fees that are a fraction of the cost, which is rare for other blockchains to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the time of writing, Avalanche is the 10th-largest crypto based on market capitalization. AVAX\u2019s consensus protocol facilitates node collaboration, ensuring transaction processing. It boosts security by randomly verifying validators\u2019 confirmations, enhancing transaction legitimacy. Additionally, its three-blockchain structure resolves common blockchain issues, offering scalability, interoperability, and user-friendliness. This sets Avalanche apart in the blockchain sector and is the core thesis for owning this token for the long-term.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nA concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStanding out due to its strong focus on sustainability and security, Cardano (ADA-USD) places third in the list of cryptos to buy instead of Ethereum. Utilizing smart contracts via the Alonzo upgrade, ADA offers lucrative investment prospects. Predictions suggest Cardano could surge to new all-time highs, as soon as this August. The jury remains out on that, but I do think this is a mega-cap token many investors will be watching closely.\n\nMuch of that has to do with Cardano\u2019s impressive user growth. Total wallets on the Cardano network are nearing 4.6 million, with active daily addresses surpassing 30,000 and peaking at 64,568 on February 16. This spike in interest hints at growing demand for Cardano, signaling more upside could be on the short-, medium- and long-term horizon.\n\nI think Cardano\u2019s relative value proposition is intriguing, but I wouldn\u2019t be the farm on this one. Even still, Cardano can be viewed as a diversification play for investors looking to build a well-rounded crypto portfolio. In that regard, this network, with its strong fundamental growth metrics, appears appealing at current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "As Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade nears, here is all you need to know - crypto.news",
        "content": "Discover how Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade could enhance security and reduce transaction fees.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) network is set to receive a major update named \u201cDencun,\u201d a blend of two smaller upgrades, Cancun and Deneb. The upgrade is expected to significantly reduce layer 2 (L2) transaction fees and enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, efficiency, and security.\n\nThe Ethereum upgrade date is scheduled for March 13, with a Feb. 27 entry on the Ethereum Foundation Blog announcing that it has been successfully activated on all test networks, including Goerli, Sepolia, and Hole\u0161ky.\n\nquick notes from the eth dev call this morning, acdc #128:\n\ndencun \ud83d\udc21\n\n\u2013 all client teams, except lodestar, have released final software versions for the dencun upgrade\n\n\u2013 these versions plus the dencun-ready candidate client for lodestar are currently being tested on one last\u2026 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) February 22, 2024\n\nSo, what is the Ethereum Dencun upgrade? Read on to find out why it is causing so much excitement among the Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s journey and its next big step\n\nIn December 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, which brought in the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and allowed for ETH to be staked\u2014this was essential for moving Ethereum away from the older proof-of-work (PoW) consensus method.\n\nBy September 2022, Ethereum had made a big move called \u201cThe Merge,\u201d linking its main network with the Beacon Chain and switching completely to proof-of-stake. In April 2023, the Shanghai upgrade allowed users to withdraw staked ETH, making it easier for validators (people who help verify transactions) to manage their stakes.\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2023, Ethereum launched a new testing network called Hole\u0161ky, which supports 1.4 million validators and is a foundational step for the ETH Dencun upgrade.\n\nMany have asked what is the main goal of Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade. Looking back, the earlier Ethereum network upgrades were more about laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and secure Ethereum rather than directly tackling the issue of scalability.\n\nThe Merge was about moving to a greener and more efficient system of verifying transactions, and the Shanghai upgrade improved how people can stake their ETH. The ETH Dencun update, a fusion of two pivotal enhancements, is seen by many as the culmination of the journey started by previous upgrades to turn Ethereum into a faster, more secure, and more scalable network.\n\nThe first part of the upgrade, Cancun, focuses on the \u201cexecution layer\u201d\u2014how transactions are processed and managed. The second part, Deneb, tackles improvements in the \u201cconsensus layer,\u201d which is all about how network participants agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\nEnhancements for a better Ethereum\n\nThe Dencun upgrade brings several technical improvements to solidify Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure. For instance, it introduces techniques for more streamlined data management and smarter contract security, along with tweaks that promise to make Ethereum run smoothly and cost-effectively for its users.\n\nIt also aims to improve the experience for those who stake ETH, making it easier and more beneficial for users to participate in the network\u2019s security.\n\nProto-danksharding\n\nAmong Dencun\u2019s spotlight features is proto-danksharding, which was introduced through a specific Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) known as EIP-4844. In simpler terms, this feature is about making Ethereum more scalable by efficiently managing large chunks of data.\n\nIt employs a method that temporarily holds transaction data, making the process smoother and cheaper.\n\nTraditionally, all transaction data is kept on the blockchain permanently. However, this new approach introduces a way to include large chunks of data (blobs) in transactions without storing them forever.\n\nIts proponents claim it will make processing transactions faster and cheaper, especially for rollups. Rollups bunch several transactions into one, reducing the workload and cost (gas) of recording them on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile rollups are already a step forward in managing transactions more efficiently, they still leave room for improvement. Until now, the data collected by rollups had to be stored permanently on the blockchain, taking up space and potentially slowing things down.\n\nProto-danksharding proposes a way for this data to be temporarily stored and removed after a specific time. It is done by creating a summary (or commitment) of the data, which ensures that even after the detailed data is deleted, the integrity of the transactions is not compromised.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this approach means that only temporary storage of data is necessary, significantly reducing the clutter and maintaining the speed and efficiency of the Ethereum network. This temporary storage could last a few months before the data is deleted to prevent an overload of unnecessary information.\n\nImproved security and performance\n\nThe most recent update to Ethereum introduces several EIPs aimed at making the network more secure and efficient.\n\nA standout feature is EIP-4788, which enhances how information travels within Ethereum, particularly improving the connection between its execution and consensus layers. In the past, these layers worked together as separate entities, ensuring that for every block of data in one layer, there was a corresponding block in the other.\n\nHowever, getting these layers to talk to each other could be quite complicated, sometimes even needing extra help from external services.\n\nWith the new upgrade, this process gets simpler by incorporating a summary from the consensus layer directly into the execution layer\u2019s current block of data. This summary acts like a bridge, allowing direct access to the consensus layer\u2019s information without needing a middleman, making the system more trustworthy.\n\nFurthermore, this update supports Ethereum\u2019s apps by keeping a log of these summaries in a smart contract, making it easier to check on the consensus layer\u2019s status.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale: Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade driving price upward\n\nImproved staking\n\nDencun is also on a mission to improve the staking experience on Ethereum.\n\nProposals like EIP-7044 and EIP-7045 aim to streamline the process of exiting and making attestations, making it more user-friendly. Here\u2019s a simple breakdown:\n\nEIP-7044 is expected to simplify earning rewards from Ethereum for those who prefer not to be full validators. Since Ethereum transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model, individuals can earn rewards by staking 32 ETH. However, those who are not interested in managing the technical aspects of being a validator can opt for delegated staking. With delegated staking, they stake their ETH through a third party while retaining control over their assets. Previously, stopping staking with a specific validator required a pre-signed exit message, which relied on trust. EIP-7044 aims to make these exit messages permanent, providing more security and peace of mind.\n\nMeanwhile, EIP-7045 seeks to improve the Ethereum network\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness. For a block to be considered official, it needs validations or attestations from validators. Currently, validators have a limited time window to submit these attestations. However, EIP-7045 proposes to extend this period significantly. This change would allow more validators to earn rewards and, importantly, speed up the confirmation of blocks on the blockchain.\n\nEnhanced cost efficiency\n\nThe forthcoming update will also introduce significant cost-efficiency improvements, particularly those highlighted by innovations such as EIP-5656 and EIP-1153.\n\nThese changes focus on streamlining smart contract functionality and enhancing temporary storage techniques. Specifically, EIP-5656 introduces an operation code, or opcode, called MCOPY, aimed at boosting the efficiency of memory copying within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nThis opcode simplifies the process by replacing the previously cumbersome method involving MSTORE and MLOAD opcodes, offering a more streamlined and effective approach.\n\nFurther addressing efficiency, EIP-6780 targets the controversial SELFDESTRUCT opcode. While widely used in numerous smart contracts, its problematic nature has caught the community\u2019s attention.\n\nThrough EIP-6780, the goal isn\u2019t to remove SELFDESTRUCT entirely\u2014which would impact existing contracts\u2014but to render it obsolete for future applications, effectively sidelining it without direct elimination.\n\nThese improvements are all about making Ethereum staking more flexible, secure, and efficient for everyone involved.\n\nSimplifying Ethereum\u2019s growth\n\nAnother proposal in the next Ethereum upgrade is EIP-7514, and it\u2019s all about managing how many new validators can join Ethereum at once. Too many validators joining too fast could cause problems, like making some tasks harder or leading to too much control being in the hands of a few big players.\n\nNext up, we continued a conversation from last week's ACDC call, about whether to add a constant cap to the validator activation queue. The proposal had since then been formalized as EIP-7514: https://t.co/sd4D4GlMRY \u2014 timbeiko.eth \u2600\ufe0f (@TimBeiko) September 14, 2023\n\nEIP-7514 plans to limit how many new validators can start in each epoch (a set period in the Ethereum network) to 8. This change aims to make the growth of validators more steady instead of jumping up fast. It\u2019s like inviting only a certain number of people to a party to make sure it doesn\u2019t get too crowded.\n\nAnother important part of this proposal is that it treats joining and leaving differently. More specifically, the limit only applies to new validators joining, not those wanting to leave.\n\nWhile it might seem like a small tweak, it\u2019s an important step to keep Ethereum running smoothly and ensure it\u2019s ready for future changes and growth. By doing this, Ethereum hopes to maintain its security and decentralization, ensuring no single group has too much power and keeping the network accessible and fair for all users.\n\nA cautious yet optimistic outlook\n\nWhile the Dencun upgrade offers promising prospects for enhancing Ethereum, developers are proceeding with caution. Introducing new consensus mechanisms and architectural changes could bring unforeseen complexities and operational hurdles.\n\nAdditionally, network upgrades inherently involve uncertainty, as unexpected technical issues may temporarily affect user experience and network stability. Concerns include potential challenges related to storage capacity and data management with the introduction of larger data blocks.\n\nTo fully embrace this transformative upgrade, stakeholders must exercise prudence and conduct thorough due diligence.\n\nNevertheless, the anticipation surrounding the next Ethereum upgrade underscores a strong belief in its benefits, reaffirming the network\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAll good things come at a cost\u2014and in this case, skyrocketing prices across the crypto market have also triggered an equally steep rise in Ethereum gas fees.\n\nOn Ethereum, massive levels of network traffic pushed gas fees beyond 174 gwei by midday Monday according to Etherscan, incurring significant costs for traders attempting to complete various types of transactions within the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nTo give an indication of the severity of the gas fee uptick: The average charge to complete a typical NFT transaction on Ethereum eclipsed $372.29 at certain points on Monday. This means users, even if they were swapping profile pictures (PFPs) among friends for free, would have to pay hundreds of dollars just to see those transactions completed.\n\nSwapping tokens on Ethereum cost almost as much at several points on Monday, upwards of $220 per transaction. Such prohibitively expensive fees potentially eliminate the value of certain crypto transactions, as the costs could eliminate any potential profits from flipping tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBorrowing on Ethereum cost above $186 per transaction at certain points on Monday; attempting to escape such steep prices by bridging funds from Ethereum to another blockchain cost over $70 on average.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the largest gas guzzler in the Ethereum ecosystem has been Uniswap, a protocol for trading fungible ERC-20 tokens. Over $4.2 million worth of ETH has been burned completing transactions on the platform in the last day.\n\nThe uptick in exorbitant on-chain surcharges comes as cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2014as well as on-chain assets like NFTs\u2014are experiencing massive surges in value.\n\nOn Monday morning, ETH hit $3,500 for the first time since the start of 2022. Minutes later, an Ethereum-based CryptoPunks NFT sold for a whopping $16.03 million worth of ETH, the second-highest price ever fetched by a piece in the popular PFP collection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe gas fee surge also comes just days before Ethereum\u2019s much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, which is set to substantially reduce transaction costs on Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks via a novel data storage method called proto-danksharding.\n\nSeveral layer-2 developers recently told Decrypt that they anticipate Dencun will so significantly reduce gas fees in the Ethereum ecosystem, that the concept of such charges may soon become obsolete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to enter a world where most users are just not going to experience gas at all,\u201d Polygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman previously told Decrypt, \u201cand it becomes abstracted away.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

This spike in activity hints at rising investor interest in the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency. Many believe the momentum could propel Ethereum\u2019s price to new heights soon.\n\nCoinMarketCap data shows that in the past week, the coin has been up by over 17%. Also, the past month has been bullish for the price of ETH, recording a price growth of over 52%.\n\nDespite this growth, the community still wants to know if this is a short-term pump or a sustainable uptrend.\n\nSee the analysis below for a closer look at the data signaling where Ethereum could head next.\n\nTechnical Analysis \u2013 Indicators Signal Bullish Sentiment\n\nSeveral technical indicators currently signal bullish strength for Ethereum. The trendlines with breaks show Ethereum\u2019s price repeatedly breaking above descending trendlines. This pattern confirms an upward trend is in play, with bulls outmuscling bears.\n\nLooking at the chart, if the coin follows this trendline, the next possible target will be above $4,000. That\u2019s an increase of more than 32% from its current level ($3,498). Supporting the uptrend, Ethereum\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) sits above 75.\n\nAn RSI over 70 is considered overbought territory and reveals extremely strong buying pressure driving up the market.\n\nAdditionally, the SuperTrend indicator has flashed a buy signal, suggesting the upside momentum will likely continue based on recent price action. The money flow index (MFI) over 80 further confirms bullishness.\n\nMFIs in this range indicate intense buying interest from institutions and other high-volume traders.\n\nTogether, these technical signals show that Ethereum will likely go up soon. Also, the indicators reveal buyers are firmly in control across multiple time frames. However, the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile and unpredictable.\n\nAs always, investors should do their own research before entering positions.\n\nWhile Ethereum is growing, investors have started betting huge funds on it to go even higher. But to gauge Ethereum\u2019s future trajectory, we must analyze the driving factors behind its recent success.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Open Interest Jumps $400M in Weekend, Another Bullish Sign?\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance declined, the speculation was that money would flow into promising altcoins like Ethereum. As such, speculative traders didn\u2019t waste time over the weekend.\n\nThey piled into bullish Ethereum futures contracts, betting on further price appreciation.\n\nData shows Ethereum\u2019s aggregate open interest in derivatives hit $11.8 billion \u2013 a 3-year high after climbing $400 million in a few days.\n\nSource: CoinGlass\n\nThis open interest surge signals traders expect Ethereum to rally. With Bitcoin holders now in profit, many may reinvest some gains into cheaper alternatives offering higher upsides.\n\nEthereum stands to be the destination as money rotates from Bitcoin. Its technological upgrades and growth trajectory continue to fuel bullish narratives.\n\nIf more people start buying Bitcoin again, especially because of new ETFs, Ethereum might also benefit from this trend and increase in value. This could push the Ethereum price to around $4,000. However, as mentioned earlier, crypto markets can shift rapidly. Prudent investors should still assess their risk tolerance.\n\nEthereum Nears $4,000 Hurdle After Weekend Rally: Will It Cross the Mark?\n\nEthereum trades above $3,500, up 5% from the prior day\u2019s low of $3,365. Given the recent positive momentum, Ethereum might be able to reach $4,000 again, a level it hasn\u2019t seen since late 2021.\n\nNote that a lot of investors who bought Ethereum when the price was high in 2021 are still at a loss.\n\nSo, as the price gets closer to where they entered the market, these investors might sell to make a profit. However, there\u2019s a challenge at $3,650, which acts as a significant resistance level. So, ETH has to cross this resistance to push forward to the $4000 price target.\n\nThe good news is that recent on-chain data shows over 1.1 million ETH investor addresses acquired tokens at $3,572 on average.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\nThis shows that the interest in the coin is increasing day after day. So, if more buyers can buy Ethereum for around $3,650, it could break through a big obstacle. But while traders track whether Ethereum can gather enough thrust, investors have another opportunity emerging, Sponge V2.\n\nThis new crypto is making headlines and currently trades below $1.\n\nEthereum Alternative: Sponge V2, The Next Big Thing in the Crypto Market\n\nDuring the rise of Pepe in the summer of 2023, another meme coin called Sponge, inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants, also went up in value. Sponge reached a market value of $100 million, giving early investors a profit of 100 times what they invested.\n\nThe interesting thing is that Sponge achieved this without any complex token features or practical uses. Now, with the next bull market coming, the team behind Sponge has launched Sponge V2 on the Polygon network. This new version offers lower fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nSponge V2: A New Era of Growth and Opportunity\n\n>>>Visit Sponge V2 Presale<<<\n\nThe latest Sponge V2 now has new staking features and a racing game where you can earn rewards. This makes the token more useful and also takes some out of circulation.\n\nRight now, token holders can earn a high return of 656%, but this will drop as more people start staking their tokens.\n\nThe V2 token started on February 9 and has already increased significantly. Even though its market value is only $65 million, there\u2019s a chance Sponge could have a big jump in the future as Pepe did.\n\nAccording to Sponge\u2019s website, the token will be available on bigger and better exchanges.\n\nIn a YouTube video, Jacob Bury mentioned the possibility of Sponge being listed on Binance, but it\u2019s just an idea for now. Bury\u2019s speculation shows people are optimistic about Sponge\u2019s future in the current market. With that in mind, interested prospects should visit the official page and buy the token.\n\n\ud83d\udd0eLooking for the next 10X crypto?\n\nCheck out the best crypto presales to invest now"

        "title": "How to Buy Ethereum and Best Exchange Ratings - CoinCentral",
        "content": "Ethereum (Ether) launched in mid-2015 but quickly surpassed the market cap of all other cryptocurrencies\u2014except for Bitcoin. At the start of 2017, the price of 1 ETH was less than $10. Since this time, the price at one point reached more than 40 times its 2017 starting price.\n\nThis incredible growth in price, combined with a wider understanding of Ethereum\u2019s potential, has many new investors looking to buy Ethereum.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum\n\nThe easiest way to buy Ethereum is to use an online cryptocurrency exchange. As cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity over the last few years, there\u2019s been no shortage of new businesses looking to facilitate exchanging them.\n\nWith so many choices to choose from, our goal is to help you find the exchange that\u2019s right for you. This guide will detail the differences between exchanges while linking to complete reviews and user guides of each exchange mentioned. While all of these cryptocurrency exchanges do the same thing (facilitate buying and selling cryptocurrencies), they operate differently. To make things easier to understand, we\u2019ve outlined 3 groups of exchanges:\n\nGroup A: Fiat to Crypto Onramps\n\nThis first group of exchanges allows users to trade fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) and cryptocurrencies on an open market. These sites function similarly to traditional forex and stock exchanges, allowing users to make limit, market, stop, and even margin trades.\n\nTypically, these sites have limited deposit and withdrawal methods for fiat currencies, most commonly offering bank wires and bank transfers.\n\nWhile these sites can be complicated for new users, they typically have the lowest fees of any group.\n\nExchanges in Group A include Gemini, Kraken, GDAX, & CEX.IO (CEX.IO also offers Group B offerings).\n\nGroup B: Ease of Use\n\nThe second group of exchanges operate more like \u201conline cryptocurrency retail stores\u201d. Rather than have their users make trades on a market, they directly facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency with their users. This creates a more beginner-friendly process than group A exchanges.\n\nThese exchanges also typically allow users to make purchases with debit and credit cards, in addition to bank wires/transfers.\n\nWhile these sites are typically thought of as the easiest ways for beginners to buy and sell Ethereum, they charge higher fees than Group A exchanges.\n\nExchanges in Group B include Coinbase, CEX.IO, and Coinmama.\n\nGroup C: Best for Trading\n\nThe last group of exchanges work similarly to Group A exchanges but only offer cryptocurrency trading. This means on these exchanges, you can only trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies. This group does not offer the ability to buy or sell cryptocurrencies with fiat currency.\n\n3 Beginner Friendly Methods for Buying Ethereum\n\nNumerous startups looking to help customers buy and sell cryptocurrencies have sprouted in response to the increased demand for cryptocurrencies. With so many options to choose from, here are 3 of the most widely recommended and trusted beginner-friendly places to buy Ether.\n\n1) Coinbase\n\nCoinbase is our top recommendation for beginners looking to purchase Ether. Coinbase offers functions that serve as training wheels for newcomers.\n\nWith its initial launch in 2012, Coinbase aimed to create an easier way to buy and sell Bitcoin. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase directly facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrency to its users. Their site comes with a variety of advantages over other exchanges:\n\nYour guaranteed price and fees are clearly stated at the time of your order. This means no dealing with complicated market interfaces.\n\nat the time of your order. This means no dealing with complicated market interfaces. You can lock in prices for your first order faster on Coinbase than on most exchanges. Coinbase locks in your price when you initiate an order, rather than waiting for deposits to clear. You will receive the amount of cryptocurrency you purchased, at the set order price, after your deposit has cleared.\n\non Coinbase than on most exchanges. Coinbase locks in your price when you initiate an order, rather than waiting for deposits to clear. You will receive the amount of cryptocurrency you purchased, at the set order price, after your deposit has cleared. You can use credit and debit cards for instant Coinbase purchases, although your limits will be substantially lower than if using a bank transfer.\n\nSensing an increase in demand for Ether, Coinbase added Ethereum support in 2016. Their Ethereum services now come with the same benefits as their original Bitcoin service.\n\nWhile we recommend storing cryptocurrency in a wallet that you have full control over, Coinbase does offer one of the most secure online wallets. You can use your Coinbase wallet to store, send, and receive Ethereum.\n\nIn addition to being easy to use, Coinbase is also one of the most trusted names in cryptocurrency. The company is based out of San Francisco, California and has received numerous investments from big-name venture capitalists, and is notably valued at $1.6 billion. As a U.S.-based digital asset exchange, the company is also compliant with all required laws and regulations. Coinbase has helped over 11 million users in 32 countries exchange more than $20 billion in digital currency.\n\nYou can sign up for Coinbase or learn more in our complete Coinbase Review and User Guide.\n\n2) Gemini\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss founded Gemini in 2015. The company is based out of New York, thus regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Despite being around for less time than some competitors, they\u2019ve quickly built a great reputation.\n\nUnlike Coinbase, Gemini operates as a more \u2018traditional\u2019 cryptocurrency exchange. This means that users can use the website to trade with other users on their market. The site functions like a traditional stock or Forex platform.\n\nGemini users can trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USD. Deposits and withdrawals are unfortunately only available via bank transfer and bank wire. However, the site does allow you to begin trading while your deposits are still processing. This gives users the ability to lock in purchase prices faster than almost all other traditional exchanges. Gemini also still comes with the very low fees associated with \u201cGroup A exchanges\u201d.\n\nWhile we do think Gemini is slightly less beginner friendly than Coinbase, their team has done a phenomenal job designing an interface that\u2019s easy to use.\n\nYou can learn more by reading our Gemini review or you can sign up for Gemini here.\n\nCEX.IO\n\nBased out of London, CEX.IO represents another long-trusted method of buying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company was initially started in 2013 as both a Bitcoin exchange and cloud mining service provider. In 2016, the company added Ethereum to its platform and ended its cloud mining service. They\u2019ve also recently added Dash and Zcash to their platform.\n\nCEX.IO offers both a full exchange, as well as easy buy/sell methods. The site accepts deposits and withdrawals with credit cards and bank transfers. They also give verified members higher credit card limits than Coinbase.\n\nThe downside to CEX.IO, compared to Coinbase, is its potential higher fees. Still, CEX.IO is a good option for users wanting to make large purchases with credit cards, or users in locations not supported by Coinbase.\n\nYou can learn more in our CEX.IO review or sign up there now.\n\nMore Exchanges\n\nFor the vast majority of you reading this, one of the above three exchanges is most likely your best option for buying Ethereum.\n\nCoinbase \u2013 Most widely trusted and easiest-to-use exchange.\n\n\u2013 Most widely trusted and easiest-to-use exchange. Gemini \u2013 Very low fees, while still being relatively beginner-friendly.\n\n\u2013 Very low fees, while still being relatively beginner-friendly. CEX.IO \u2013 Very high credit card purchasing limits compared to alternatives.\n\nWith that said, we realize everyone has different needs, so here are more of our recommended options.\n\nCoinmama\n\nCoinmama is another option for those of you looking to buy large amounts of ether with credit cards. The Slovakian exchange allows users to purchase both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nUnlike Coinbase and CEX.IO, Coinmama does not offer a wallet service, meaning you will have to provide an Ethereum address from a separate wallet where your Ether can be sent. For this reason, we view it as a less beginner-friendly option than these competitors.\n\nLike CEX.IO, which also offers high credit card purchase limits, Coinmama has rather high fees. You can compare credit card fees between exchanges in the credit card section below.\n\nKraken\n\nKraken is another exchange option for those looking to trade fiat currencies for Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies. Like Gemini and Coinbase, they allow users to make fiat deposits through bank transfers and wires. The site also offers far more altcoins to trade than these two competitors. Still, we suggest choosing between Kraken and Poloniex as these are the best options.\n\nWhile Kraken does not offer as many cryptocurrencies to trade as Bittrex, they do offer to trade for the following cryptocurrencies:\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, Zcash, Dash, Ethereum Classic, Gnosis, Iconomi, Melon, EOS, Augur, Tether, Dogecoin, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash\n\nEstablished in 2011, the company has built a solid reputation in the cryptocurrency community over the years. They do however seem to have more complaints about slow customer support than most of their competitors. Another common complaint is their poor user interface.\n\nBuy Ethereum with a Credit Card\n\nMany cryptocurrency newcomers hope to use a credit card to make their first purchase. Unfortunately, very few exchanges accept credit cards. For the ones that do, credit cards open the door for fraudulent purchases, chargebacks, and high fees.\n\nThere are, however, a few good cryptocurrency exchanges accepting credit cards. You can compare them in the table below and learn more about each site by clicking their respective review.\n\n*CEX.IO fee estimates are for \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d FOK orders. Fees are lower when trading on their exchange.\n\nEthereum Buyer\u2019s Guide FAQ\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough time to answer every individual question readers have when it comes time to make their first Ether purchase. However, we have answered many of the most common questions asked by Ethereum newcomers below.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Ethereum and Ether?\n\nEther is the currency of the Ethereum network. While technically, the currency is not called Ethereum, the term is often used interchangeably to describe both the network and the currency. For this reason and to not confuse any readers, we too use the term \u201cEthereum\u201d interchangeably.\n\nFor a better understanding, you may want to read our Beginners\u2019 Guide to Ethereum.\n\nDo I have to Buy an Entire Ether?\n\nNo! Ether is divisible to 18 decimal places. While no exchange will allow you to purchase .000000000000000001 Ether (worth a fraction of a US cent), most will allow you to deposit as little as $10.\n\nHow Does CoinCentral Rate Exchanges?\n\nWhen rating and reviewing exchanges, our goal is to answer the most common questions cryptocurrency traders have about exchanges. This leads us to primarily focus on the following factors:\n\nBeginner Friendliness\n\nCustomer Support\n\nCommunity Sentiment\n\nFees\n\nDeposit and Withdrawal Methods\n\nAvailable Cryptocurrencies\n\nIt\u2019s important that our readers understand the final rating number is a combination of all 6 of these factors. For example, while Coinbase may be higher rated than Kraken, that does not mean it\u2019s the better exchange for YOU. The point is, to get the most out of our reviews, you should actually read them so that you can make an informed decision.\n\nWhile our reviewers do their best to research and speak to facts, it would be impossible to say that exposure and familiarity bias does not play at least some part in our selection.\n\nHow Should I Store My Ether?\n\nIt\u2019s typically not recommended that you store large amounts of any cryptocurrency on an exchange long-term. There are two main reasons for this.\n\nWhenever a cryptocurrency wallet or exchange account is hosted online, it creates an opportunity for hackers to breach the account. You should always make sure to use secure password and enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). Note that SMS text 2FA is typically not recommended. Instead, apps like Google Authenticator and Authy are thought to be far more secure. Most online exchanges are controlled by central authorities (businesses). These businesses control your cryptocurrency wallets, as you do not have access to your wallet\u2019s keys. For this reason, it\u2019s recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet that you have full control over.\n\nYou can learn more in our Ethereum Wallet Guide.\n\nShould I Buy / Is it Too Late to Invest in Ethereum?\n\nAs with any investment, you should do your own research and not invest an amount you couldn\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nWhere Can I Buy Other Cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhile all of the above exchanges can be used to buy various other cryptocurrencies, we\u2019ve created specific guides for the following coins:"

        "content": "The SEC\u2019s postponement of verdicts on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETF applications from investment powerhouses BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity came as no surprise. It\u2019s maintaining an anti-crypto stance despite approvals for Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 which the courts essentially forced the SEC to approve. The review for BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund, originally slated for March, now shifts focus to May for potential approvals.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Price: A Beacon of Resilience\n\nETHUSD\n\nDespite regulatory uncertainties, Ethereum\u2019s price resilience is notable, with a significant uptick from $2,289 to $3,830 since early February, marking nearly a 70% increase. This surge came in the wake of heightened expectations for Ethereum ETF approvals despite a recent pullback in gains across the crypto landscape.\n\nEthereum ETF: A Transformative Step for Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF would represent a significant breakthrough, being the inaugural ETF for a smart contract-enabled cryptocurrency. This development would elevate the position of altcoins within the financial ecosystem. Because ETH is in the realm of smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi), investors believe the broader altcoin market may attract TradFi beyond BTC and ETH.\n\nWhile the SEC contemplates the fate of the Ethereum ETF applications, Ethereum\u2019s enduring growth and the community\u2019s steadfast enthusiasm highlight the platform\u2019s robust infrastructure and widespread support. The outcome of the SEC\u2019s decision is poised to have profound effects on Ethereum\u2019s assimilation into the traditional financial sphere, underscoring its lasting significance and importance."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is starting the week having inched its way past $3,500, marking a 3% gain since this time yesterday, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ethereum price is $3,506.38, which means that ETH has gained 15% in the past week. This is the highest Ethereum has been since January 2022, when it was coming down from the late 2021 bull run. And 91% of ETH held in wallets is now in the money. That means all but 9% of ETH has appreciated in value since it was purchased, according to blockchain analytics firm IntotheBlock.\n\nEthereum developers are now only 9 days away from pushing the Dencun upgrade to mainnet on March 13. It's long been said that the upgrade, which will introduce proto-danksharding to the network, will make transactions much faster and cheaper. Last week a handful of devs told Decrypt the change will be striking, adding that this is the kind of upgrade they've been \"dreaming of.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt tends to be the case that when investors are bullish on Ethereum, DeFi projects see a lot more action. That's very much been the case this time around. The total value of assets in DeFi protocols has reached $94 billion as of Monday morning\u2014the highest it's been since TerraUSD crashed in 2022, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nIn super simple terms. the TerraUSD crash and the contagion that followed scared a lot of money out of DeFi protocols. The total value locked in DeFi projects had been $132 billion just before the Terra collapse, according to DeFi Llama.\n\nA quick refresher: The Terra ecosystem was able to grow so large so fast because it promised upwards of 20% returns on deposits. When it suddenly crashed in May 2022, it took lots of other projects and firms with it and made traders wary of protocols that promised sky-high returns.\n\nThat wariness sent the TVL as low as $36 billion in October 2023. But as of this writing, assets in the DeFi ecosystem have nearly tripled in value. Ethereum has seen 64% growth over the past month\u2014which outpaces the 54% growth it's seen in price. And Solana isn't far behind it, having seen 57% growth in the past 30 days after its native SOL token has gained 34% over the same period."

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price reached another 2024 peak at $3,530 around 06:00 GMT on March 4 as strategic traders look to place bullish bets early before ETFs open for trading.\n\nDespite the price upswing, ETH price still appears undervalued relative to the value of capital funneled into the derivatives markets over the weekend.\n\nWith Ethereum open interest currently trending at historic peaks, can the bulls capitalize on the positive momentum to drive the rally above $4,000.\n\nEthereum open interest rose $400M over the weekend\n\nEthereum price appears on the verge of registering on another bullish outing this week. The rapid decline in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D.) sparked speculations that Ethereum could gain more traction as investors began to increasingly lean into the altcoin markets.\n\nUnsurprising, speculative traders spent the weekend piling on bullish bets on ETH futures markets. Crypto derivatives analytics platform Coinglass\u2019 open interest charts presents an aggregate of the total value of funds currently invested in derivatives contracts for a specific cryptocurrency asset.\n\nAs depicted below, ETH open interest stood at $11.4 billion at the close of trading on March 1. That figure has now increased by $400 million over the weekend, reaching a 3-year peak of $11.8 billion at the time of writing on March 4.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Open Interest vs. Price | Coinglass\n\nEffectively, this implies that while ETH prices pulled back 6% from $3,500 towards $3,300, speculative traders continued to double down on their bullish positions. Furthermore, the\n\nThere\u2019s a widespread anticipation that with over 97% of current BTC holders now in profit, a number of them will likely continue to reinvest some of their gains into altcoins as observed last week.\n\nIf this scenario plays out, and Bitcoin ETFs billion-dollar buying frenzy once again sends BTC prices soaring in the coming week, ETH price stands a chance of making another leg-up towards $4,000.\n\nEthereum price prediction: Can ETH reach $4,000 this week?\n\nAt the time of writing on March 4, Ethereum price is currently trading above $3,500, up 5% from the 24-hour low of $3,365. Drawing inferences from the $400 million capital inflows into ETH derivatives markets over the weekend, Ethereum price looks set to make another attempt at breaking above $4,000 for the first time in 3-years.\n\nHowever, historical accumulation trend shows that ETH faces stiff resistance around the $3,650 area.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s in/out of the money data shows that 1.1 million addresses had acquired 205,890 ETH at the maximum price of $3,572. Considering that they\u2019ve been holding at a loss since December 2021, many of those investors could exit as ETH nears their break-even point\n\nBut if the bulls can scale that sell-wall, it could generate stronger bullish momentum for a $4,000 retest, as predicted.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price prediction, March 2024.

        "content": "Ethereum price soared to a new 2024 peak above $3,740 on March 4. ETH 2.0 staking trends suggest the Dencun upgrade could usher in more gains.\n\nAfter outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) price in February 2024, Ethereum bulls have doubled-up on their staking positions in the first week of March.\n\nWith the anticipation of further upside after the Dencun Upgrade, ETH price looks set to make another attempt at reclaiming $4,000 as the week unfolds.\n\nETH 2.0 staking deposits cross $115 billion milestone\n\nIn early February, ETH developers confirmed March 13 for the mainnet launch of the Dencun upgrade. The critical \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d feature is billed to reduce transaction costs on Ethereum as well as auxiliary Layer-2 networks.\n\nEthereum price reached a new 2024 peak of $3,743 on March 5, sparking concerns that investors could start booking profits.\n\nBut with the Dencun upgrade now 1-week away, on-chain data from the ETH 2.0 beacon chain shows that investors have maintained a bullish outlook staking their coins rather than exiting at the current historic prices.\n\nThe total staking deposits on the ETH Proof of Stake (PoS) network crossed 31.3 million ETH rose from 30,569,041 ETH. This marks a significant milestone as the total stake value has now hit the $115 billion mark.\n\n\n\nEthereum 2.0 Beacon.chain staking deposits cross $115 billion | March 2024. | Source: BeaconCha.in\n\nRising staking deposits generate positive traction for any Proof-of-Stake network. Firstly, it enhances network security and stability, which could be critical amid euphoric network activity.\n\nSecondly, it signals that despite elevated prices, ETH investors are playing the long-game, with high optimism surrounding the Dencun upgrade.\n\nOverall, Ethereum staking hitting $115 billion while prices are trending at a 3-year peak indicates an overwhelming positive conviction among investors that the upcoming network improvements could drive the rally further.\n\nForecast: can Ethereum price reach $4,000 ahead of Dencun upgrade?\n\nDrawing data-driven insights from the staking trends analyzed above, Ethereum price currently appears primed for further upswing toward $4,0000 ahead of the Dencun upgrade slated for March 13.\n\nFirst, ETH has to establish steady support above $3,800. However, the bulls must withstand the profit-taking wave from the final cluster of 8.7 million addresses that acquired 3.4 million ETH when prices last reached $4,000 in the 2021.\n\nBreaking above this final resistance level, could set the stage for ETH price to advance towards its all-time highs above $4,000, as predicted.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price prediction, March 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nOn the downside, the bears could invalidate this ETH price prediction by staging another reversal below $3,000. But as observed in the past week, the buy-wall at the $3,100 territory offers significant short-term support for ETH price."

        "content": "Transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain experienced a significant surge in the past 24 hours, coinciding with ETH\u2019s price surpassing $3,700, marking a two-year high.\n\nThis development comes amid the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) delay in ruling on multiple pending spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price spike coincides with high network fees\n\nDuring the past day, ETH\u2019s price jumped by approximately 7% to around $3720 as of press time, its highest price level since early 2022.\n\nThe surge brings ETH\u2019s total rally to over 60% during the past month, as the blockchain network mirrors a broader crypto market revival that has propelled Bitcoin\u2019s price to more than $67,000.\n\nHowever, Ethereum network gas prices soared amidst this price upward trajectory, hitting an average peak of 79 gwei, with peak costs reaching as high as 219 gwei, according to Etherscan data. Several Ethereum users took to social media to decry the high fees and how it impacted their trading activities, including token swaps and borrowing transactions.\n\nRemarkably, this surge in fees saw the total network fees surpassing $33 million in a single day, a threefold increase compared to the beginning of the year, according to data from Cryptofees.\n\nMeanwhile, market observers noted that the impending Dencun upgrade could address these high fee challenges. This upgrade is anticipated to tackle Ethereum\u2019s historical issues of sluggish transaction speeds, limited throughput, and high fees.\n\nSEC\u2019s delays spot Ethereum ETF decision\n\nDespite Ethereum\u2019s impressive surge, the SEC has further delayed its decision on BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETF application.\n\nThe regulator is seeking public comments on the potential fraud and manipulation risks associated with a spot ETH ETF and has also raised questions about Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC\u2019s decision is unsurprising as market participants remain divided on whether the regulator would greenlight Ethereum\u2019s ETF. Industry insiders say the SEC remains cautious about cryptocurrencies despite its recent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nNevertheless, major crypto stakeholders, such as Coinbase, have advocated for the approval of ETH ETFs.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been commanding significant attention in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. BTC is edging closer to its previous all-time high, while ETH has exhibited remarkable resilience by overcoming substantial resistance levels. Despite these notable performances, the overall market sentiment remains bullish, with numerous altcoins demonstrating impressive growth trajectories. Memecoins, in particular, have emerged as focal points, drawing attention with their exceptional gains.\n\nTop 6 Memecoins Rapid Surge\n\nWithin the realm of memecoins, Pepe (PEPE) has emerged as a standout performer, experiencing an unprecedented surge of 400% over the past week. At its pinnacle, the memecoin reached an impressive peak of $0.00000766. Presently, PEPE continues to maintain momentum, trading at $0.00000716, marking a substantial 32.80% increase in price and an impressive 80% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nDogwifhat (WIF) has captured significant interest, boasting a weekly surge exceeding 338%. The memecoin currently valued at $1.63, WIF showcases stability despite a marginal 6.81% decrease in price, accompanied by a modest 8.56% decline in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nFloki (FLOKI) has also made waves within the cryptocurrency community, exhibiting a remarkable 320% gain over the past week. Presently the memecoin is trading at $0.0001536, FLOKI demonstrates resilience with a slight 4.23% increase in price, juxtaposed with a notable 26% decrease in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nBonk (BONK) Solana based memecoin has witnessed a surge of over 205% in the past week, currently trading at $0.00003664. Despite experiencing a significant 45% increase in price, BONK also boasts a remarkable 108% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours, indicating heightened investor interest.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) a well known memecoin has showcased robust growth, boasting a notable 178% increase over the last week and currently trading at $0.00002711. With a commendable 22% rise in price and a modest 2% increase in trading volume within the last 24 hours, SHIB continues to captivate market participants.\n\nThe pioneering memecoin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has recorded impressive gains of 92% over the last week, trading at $0.1674. DOGE has experienced an 18% increase in price and an impressive 80% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours, underscoring its enduring appeal within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, several altcoins, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Solana (SOL), have reported substantial gains in their weekly charts. BCH surged by an impressive 70%, ADA by 33%, DOT by 31%, and SOL by 28%, as per data sourced from CoinMarketCap, further illustrating the widespread bullish sentiment pervading the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Weekly Review\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has recently surged, surpassing the $66,000 mark. As of the latest update, BTC is priced at $66,256, boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $65.53 billion and a market capitalization of $1.30 trillion. Notably, BTC has seen a 6.02% increase in price within the last 24 hours, with an impressive gain of 28% over the past week.\n\nRenowned crypto analyst CryptoCon has conveyed an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory, hinting at a potential early Christmas for enthusiasts of the digital asset. This optimism follows Bitcoin\u2019s recent breakthrough of a significant resistance level just a fortnight ago. Subsequent to this breakthrough, two new price targets have emerged: Level 3, marked at $85,334, and the Cycle Top Band, positioned at $115,000.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that the indication of $115,000 as the cycle top by the Cycle Top Band isn\u2019t set in stone. Historical data indicates that Bitcoin often surpasses previous all-time highs (ATHs), leading to an upward extension of the bands and the possibility of attaining even loftier prices. Therefore, while $115,000 may appear to be a significant milestone, it might not signify the ultimate peak.\n\nThe significance of the Cycle Top Band only materializes when Bitcoin\u2019s price interacts with it, signaling a potential conclusion of the cycle. This methodology has proven effective in the past, with Bitcoin\u2019s price movements aligning with this pattern throughout the last three cycles.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum (ETH) has broken out from a major resistance level of $3,500. Currently, ETH is priced at $3,560.83, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $23.33 billion and a market capitalization of $427.77 billion. Over the last 24 hours, ETH has observed a 3.63% increase in price and a notable 14% surge over the past week.\n\nEthereum is currently positioned for significant growth, as underscored by insights from Rekt Capital, a prominent crypto analyst. Rekt Capital points out that Ethereum has recently surpassed its Macro Range, which was previously marked in red, indicating a significant breakthrough in its price movement. This development signals a potential shift in the market dynamics.\n\nHowever, in order to sustain this upward momentum, Ethereum now faces the crucial task of solidifying the former resistance level represented by the orange zone as a new support level. This transition is essential for Ethereum to consolidate its gains and pave the way for further price appreciation. Successfully establishing this support level would provide a strong foundation for Ethereum to ascend to higher price levels with greater stability and confidence.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, the current trajectory of Ethereum\u2019s price action is encouraging. The market sentiment is optimistic, reflecting growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s long-term prospects and its ability to navigate through evolving market conditions."

        "title": "What Should the Crypto Market Expect From Ethereum Dencun Upgrade? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks, breaking through the $3,000 mark and showcasing bullish momentum that has captured the attention of investors worldwide. A significant contributing factor to this surge is the eagerly anticipated Ethereum Dencun upgrade, slated for deployment on the mainnet come March 13, 2024. This upgrade, representing a pivotal milestone in Ethereum roadmap, promises to usher in a new era of scalability, efficiency, and security. Let\u2019s delve into what the crypto market can expect from this transformative development.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe anticipated Cancun-Deneb upgrade, or Ethereum Dencun Upgrade, is set for release in March 2024 and aims to improve scalability, efficiency, and security of the Ethereum network through Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The term \u201cDencun\u201d signifies progress in the execution layer (EL) and the consensus layer (CL).\n\nadvertisement\n\nFollowing the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which enabled staked ETH withdrawals in April 2023, the Dencun upgrade represents a significant milestone in Ethereum\u2019s evolutionary journey. It is set to implement nine EIPs, marking the initiation of what Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin terms \u201cThe Surge\u201d era. Buterin emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s dedication to alleviating scalability bottlenecks, with a target of surpassing \u201c10,000 transactions per second and beyond\u201d during this phase.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade lays the groundwork for Ethereum to achieve mass scalability through the adoption of layer-two rollups. Notably, proto-danksharding, one of the key EIPs slated for implementation, is expected to drive widespread adoption of rollups by reducing gas fees on Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.\n\nEssentially, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade marks a crucial point in Ethereum\u2019s efforts to improve scalability and efficiency, paving the way for increased usage and improved capabilities in the network.\n\nWhat To Expect from Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect from the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade.\n\n1. Scalability and Efficiency Improvements:\n\nThe Dencun upgrade prioritizes scalability through initiatives such as proto-danksharding. This approach to sharding is aimed at optimizing gas fees and transaction throughput. This progress significantly improves Ethereum\u2019s ability to overcome its scalability issues, enabling it to comfortably manage more transactions and enhance user experience.\n\n2. Layer-2 Rollups Focus:\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun Upgrade marks a significant change in attention to Layer-2 rollups, as opposed to past upgrades that mainly focused on Layer-1 improvements. Layer-2 rollups are a strategic move towards improving scalability and transaction speed while maintaining Ethereum blockchain security\n\nLayer-2 rollups play a vital role in preparing for Ethereum\u2019s \u201cThe Surge\u201d era, focusing on achieving mass scalability. By processing transactions off-chain, they help alleviate congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and ensure data security and integrity.\n\nLayer-2 rollups have important characteristics such as off-chain processing, which allows transactions to be executed without taking up space on the Ethereum blockchain, and transaction aggregation, which combines several transactions into one compressed form after execution. Subsequently, the compressed transaction data is posted to the Ethereum main chain, ensuring data availability and verifiability for all network participants.\n\nIn a nutshell, the focus on Layer-2 rollups in the Dencun update represents a strategic move towards scalable and efficient transaction processing on Ethereum, while also upholding strong security measures.\n\n3. Impact on DeFi and NFTs:\n\nThe integration of Layer-2 rollups through the Dencun upgrade is expected to have a notable effect on the spheres of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFTs) in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe implementation of Layer-2 rollups boosts Ethereum\u2019s scalability, creating a more effective setting for DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces to function within. By easing congestion and cutting gas fees, rollups quicken transaction processing, thus improving user experience and accessibility of DeFi and NFT platforms.\n\nConsequently, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms could experience advantages from improved efficiency and cost savings, leading to increased involvement and creativity in these areas. In addition, the increased use of layer-2 solutions is predicted to accelerate the arrival of DeFi 2.0, which will have improved scalability, interoperability, and usability.\n\nWith the Dencun upgrade set to launch on March 13, 2024, we expect an increase in the usage of Ethereum Layer 2 solutions for DeFi and NFTs. This adoption is anticipated to continue driving the expansion and progress of decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, creating fresh opportunities and applications in different industries.\n\n4. Price Implications:\n\nThe anticipation surrounding the Dencun upgrade has already influenced Ethereum (ETH) Price, with investors eagerly awaiting its implementation. As scalability improves and layer-2 solutions gain traction, ETH prices may experience a bullish trend, potentially reaching new all-time highs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum\u2019s evolution, holding the capacity to redefine the crypto scene. Ethereum is focusing on scalability, efficiency, and security to set the stage for upcoming innovation and adoption. The crypto community is eagerly anticipating the activation of the Dencun upgrade on the mainnet, with all attention focused on Ethereum as it prepares to unlock the potential of decentralized finance and more."

        "title": "ETHDenver 2024: 3 Top Takeaways - Unchained",
        "content": "The festival saw a more than 33% increase to 20,000 visitors compared to last year. What do the attendees and presenters tell us about the future of Ethereum and crypto in general?\n\nAs the seventh annual ETHDenver drew to a close on Sunday, reflecting on who came and presented offers a hint at the future of Ethereum and crypto generally. The festival announced it had more than 20,000 attendees this year, a more than 33% increase from last year\u2019s 15,000 unique visitors. Among them were founders and developers of layer 2 and non-Ethereum projects as well as members of the U.S. government and a presidential candidate.\n\nLooking at the attendees and presenters of ETHDenver 2024, here are three takeaways about the future of Ethereum and crypto in general.\n\nRead more: ETHDenver\u2019s 2024 Hackathon: Onchain Security, AI, and Gaming Fun Dominate the Winning Projects\n\nTakeaway #1: Horizontal May Be the Answer to Ethereum\u2019s Scalability Problem\n\nEthereum has long had a scalability problem. When the number of transactions and users increases substantially on Ethereum, the blockchain network suffers in performance, marked by high levels of gas fees. Layer two (L2) rollups, which have been endorsed by the blockchain\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin since Oct. 2020, are seen as the answer to the scalability problem.\n\nThe number of L2s has substantially grown in the past couple of years as data analytics website L2Beat shows that there are 44 L2 projects currently.\n\nDespite the proliferation of scalability solutions in the form of L2s, \u201cwe are starting to see a lot of limitations on the performance of L2\u2026 notably recently with Inscriptions,\u201d Kenny Li, co-founder of L2 Manta, said to Unchained in an interview. For example, Arbitrum suffered an outage in Dec. 2023 because of a surge in inscriptions.\n\nLi said, \u201cThe scalability problem is not solved at all, especially when we\u2019ve talked about these killer apps, these 1 billion users\u2026 Most of these L2s are not going to be able to sustain 1 million active users, and so now the question is: what do we do next?\u201d\n\nWhile L2s offer faster and cheaper transactions than the base layer of Ethereum, they suffer from fragmentation. An application on one L2 can\u2019t efficiently communicate with the version of itself on a different chain, can\u2019t share liquidity, nor access the same user base, according to Li.\n\nPolygon co-founder Brendan Farmer noted a similar observation. \u201cIf we think about the current state of crypto, we\u2019re limited by infrastructure, and so we believe that in order to capture latent demand that we think exists, we need to remove the scaling limitations.\u201d\n\nFor both Manta\u2019s Li and Polygon\u2019s Farmer, how the crypto space progresses forward with widespread adoption is through \u201chorizontal scalability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where we can solve it, [scalability], in the sense of it\u2019s not going to be through one singular L2, or L3 even. It\u2019s going to be through horizontal scalability,\u201d Li indicated. \u201cInstead of just having the [transactions per second] of one L2, you can take advantage of the TPS of all the different L2s that are existing today that way applications when they need to scale their user base, they can look across all these L2s and say, \u2018Okay this one\u2019s got the TPS I need currently and start running compute through that\u2026 I think that\u2019s very akin to a very tried and true model, which is cloud computing.\u201d\n\nRemoving limitations on infrastructure, according to Farmer, is the ability to scale horizontally through Polygon\u2019s aggregation layer. \u201cThe way we think about the agg layer is, it\u2019s this piece of shared infrastructure that provides unified liquidity and composability and a user base that\u2019s accessible to any chain and there\u2019s no requirement to join the agg layer.\u201d\n\nThe focus on horizontal scalability has provided a sense of optimism for Farmer. \u201cThis is the first time where it\u2019s felt like there are real solutions to infrastructure problems that have been facing us for a long time. We can see in the distance the way to build an internet scale crypto ecosystem that is not limited by a lot of the infrastructure bottlenecks that we faced in the past,\u201d Farmer said.\n\nTakeaway #2: Ecosystems Merging\n\nETHDenver, as its name suggests, has historically been the home of Ethereum enthusiasts, contributors, and developers, and yet the annual community gathering has attracted individuals and communities from other blockchain networks, notably Solana and Bitcoin, demonstrating the growing overlap between the various sub ecosystems within the crypto space.\n\nOne of the talks on the mainstage was about how projects such as Eclipse, Neon, Monad, and Polygon were merging Solana and Ethereum together. One of the speakers, Polygon advisor Ajit Tripathi, praised both Ethereum\u2019s culture of research and Solana\u2019s product first, engineering culture, saying \u201cthese two things need to come together.\u201d\n\nSukanya Parashar, senior integration engineer for Neon EVM, which is based on Solana, said on stage, \u201cWe wanted something to build for the Ethereum community so that they easily can deploy their existing apps on Solana and get Solana\u2019s benefits of high transaction speed, low gas fees and of course parallel execution.\u201d\n\nCosmos, another blockchain network, is also seeing an overlap with the Ethereum community. \u201cWe\u2019re headed towards an industry where the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystem are slowly converging\u2026 For example, there are rollups on Ethereum right now that are secured by Celestia DA,\u201d said Avril Dutheil, a core contributor of Cosmos-based chain Neutron, in an interview with Unchained.\n\nCelestia, as a standard Cosmos-SDK based blockchain that is known for its data availability services, is \u201can example of Cosmos actually securing Ethereum,\u201d Dutheil added.\n\nSimilarly to those in the Solana and Cosmos ecosystem, Bitcoiners are learning from the experiments happening on Ethereum. In fact, \u201cthere\u2019s an amazing opportunity to learn from everything that has already happened in Ethereum,\u201d Muneeb Ali, the co-creator of layer 2 Bitcoin network Stacks, said in a talk called, \u201cHave Fun Staking Turing Incomplete: What Bitcoin Builders Borrowed From Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDavid Tse, co-founder of BabylonChain and professor at Stanford University, said in the same talk that 1,200 people showed up to a Bitcoin event at ETHDenver, highlighting the synergy between Bitcoiners and Ethereum contributors.\n\n\u201cThe event was to showcase that there are synergies between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, and other ecosystems\u2026 Maximalism is not great, and I think if you work together, we can achieve much bigger things and just grow the piece,\u201d said co-panelist Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of BOB, a hybrid L2 between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nTakeaway #3: Politicians Recognize the Importance of Crypto\n\nThe United States federal government has not been friendly toward crypto, but three government officials and candidates came to ETHDenver to discuss how they hope to change the relationship.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, local congressional representative Brittany Petterson (D-CO), and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., each spoke on the mainstage.\n\nPeirce lamented the lack of regulatory clarity from the agency she currently serves, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, saying, \u201cIf you really want to sort the bad behavior from the good behavior, having rules that are clear to people who want to follow them is a much better approach.\u201d\n\nWhen CoinDesk\u2019s Jennifer Sanasie asked Petterson about how to stop American crypto startups from leaving the U.S. and setting up in regions with more regulatory clarity, Petterson said that the flight of investments \u2014 crypto or not \u2014 is a concern of hers in general.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s in question whether or not we will even do our job and pay our bills as the United States of America, if you can even believe that\u2019s how bad it\u2019s gotten at the federal level. And so our inability to govern, our inability to regulate and change with changing times as quickly as technology is innovating and [as] our economy is innovating, that is a huge problem for our long-term success as a country,\u201d Pettersen said on ETHDenver\u2019s main stage.\n\nKennedy Jr. emphasized his alignment with the crypto community, saying how he was going to \u201cend the war against all cryptocurrencies,\u201d in his press conference at ETHDenver.\n\n\u201cWe need the infrastructure for transactional freedom in this country so that people can use Bitcoin and they feel comfortable\u2026 There\u2019s a million ways to do that and I want to explore everything,\u201d he said. The political discussions at ETHDenver boil down to the prominent and growing intersection between the crypto industry and the U.S. government."

        "title": "BlackRock Spot Ether ETF Again Delayed by SEC - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Ethereum\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has again delayed BlackRock Inc.\u2019s spot ethereum ETF application, extending their time to decide on the asset management giant\u2019s proposal for an exchange-traded fund holding the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe delay is the second since BlackRock filed to create the iShares Ethereum Trust in November. The agency first delayed its ruling in late January, when it also extended the review time for a similar application from Grayscale Investments.\n\nInterest in crypto ETFs is surging as investors pouring billions into spot bitcoin funds helped push the price of the top cryptocurrency to an all-time high today. Ethereum, the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while gaining lately, remains about $1,000 less than its all-time high of $4,891.70, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhile the SEC greenlit ethereum futures funds in October, it's taken a more cautious approach to ETFs that own crypto and expose investors to the so-called spot market over concerns about market manipulation and fraud. A handful of firms, including Fidelity Investments, Bitwise Asset Management, Ark Invest, and Franklin Templeton, are seeking to create their own spot ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe decision to delay the ETF was largely expected by analysts, who foresee May as the date to watch for the SEC to make a final decision on the funds.\n\n\u201cThe only date that matters for spot ethereum ETFs at this time is May 23,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter/X after Invesco\u2019s filing was punted in early February. May 23 is the final deadline for VanEck's spot ether fund.\n\nThe SEC is also asking for the public to weigh in on \"concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nEthereum vs Bitcoin\n\nMany cryptocurrency investors are hoping that after the watershed approval of ten trading spot bitcoin ETFs in January that spot ethereum funds could be just around the corner.\n\nYet while many analysts believe that the ether funds will eventually be approved, the path isn\u2019t necessarily straightforward. A central issue that has yet to be settled is whether ethereum would be designated a commodity by the SEC, according to etf.com analyst Sumit Roy.\n\nAt the ETF Exchange conference in Miami in February, a group of executives including Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s Matt Hougan, Galaxy\u2019s Steve Kurz, and Grayscale\u2019s David LaValle agreed on a spot bitcoin panel that there was about a 50% change that ethereum ETFs would be approved by their May deadline.\n\nCommenters have 21 days to submit their thoughts to the SEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum, which is the second largest cryptocurrency, has seen its price surge in recent weeks on the coattails of bitcoin\u2019s rise. The cryptocurrency is up 14% over the past week and nearly 3% over the past day, according to database CoinMarketCap.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer of cryptocurrency company Variant, has posted on X that he doubts the likelihood of a spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF approval this year.\n\nChervinsky\u2019s comments come amid a bull run in the cryptocurrency markets, and he believes such an ETF could grow the market further.\n\nSEC Faces Pressure in Ethereum ETF Approval\n\nDespite previous triumphs with Bitcoin ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finds itself under mounting political pressure and amidst market instability, factors that could influence its decision-making process, according to Chervinsky.\n\nI am a lot less confident about ETH ETF approval this year than many of you are. The SEC got a ton of political blowback for approving BTC ETFs, even though the court basically forced it to. Now animal spirits are in control of the market, and an ETH ETF would only add to that. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) March 1, 2024\n\nWhile the current market is largely fueled by hype, Chervinsky believes introducing an Ethereum ETF could fuel this phenomenon, which refers to the emotional influences driving financial markets and often leading to heightened buying or selling periods.\n\nChervinsky noted that the SEC may have a legal argument that could justify rejecting an Ethereum ETF, even if it is unfounded. He observed the agency\u2019s willingness to support controversial legal stances in court to achieve political objectives.\n\nDespite BlackRock\u2019s impressive track record in obtaining ETF approvals, Chervinsky suggested that this success came from its ability to exert pressure and a collaborative relationship with the SEC. He predicted that if the regulator were to request BlackRock and other Ethereum ETF sponsors to withdraw their applications, a common practice, they would likely comply.\n\nEven with his skepticism regarding the timeline, Chervinsky acknowledged that approving an Ethereum ETF is more a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart estimated a 60% chance of spot Ethereum ETFs being approved in May. However, analysts started reassessing their predictions as the SEC began postponing its decision on individual requests like Grayscale.\n\nBy February, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra were discussing a 50% chance of an Ethereum investment vehicle entering the market as early as May. Despite the uncertainty, individuals like CNBC\u2019s Mad Money host Jim Cramer remain optimistic, believing there is a high probability of approval coming soon.\n\nCompanies Pursuing Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nSeveral investment asset management firms, including BlackRock and Grayscale, have expressed interest in spot Ethereum ETFs by submitting applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBlackRock officially submitted its Ethereum ETF application in November 2023, preceding its approval for the spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).\n\nGrayscale, led by Michael Sonnenshein, is also vying for approval and submitted its application about a month before BlackRock\u2019s. The company seeks to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF, filing Form 19b-4 with the SEC alongside NYSE Arca. Other asset managers interested in this offering include Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and ARK 21Shares."

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization, has initiated an unexpected ETH sell-off to a single address, prompting speculation about a potential market peak.\n\nEthereum Foundation Executes Multiple ETH Transfers\n\nOn Monday, March 4, Blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain revealed a series of transactions executed by a wallet address related to the Ethereum Foundation. Sharing a screenshot of the transaction details on X (formerly Twitter), LookOnchain disclosed that the Ethereum Foundation had initiated three ETH transactions to a single wallet address identified as \u201cCumberland Forwarder\u201d.\n\nAmong these transfers, two involved selling off 500 ETH each, while the third recorded a transaction amount of 0 ETH. At the time of writing the price of Ethereum is trading at $3,684.95 according to CoinMarketCap. This price puts the value of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s 1000 ETH sell-offs at over $3.68 million.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain whether this unexpected sell-off indicates a shift in the foundation\u2019s perspective on Ethereum\u2019s current valuation, as the foundation is known for selling ETH tokens during tops. Additionally, the timing of the transfers could be an indication of a peak in Ethereum\u2019s price, which often precedes a significant price correction.\n\nIncluding the Ethereum Foundation, there have been other major ETH transfers made by investors. Earlier in January, bankrupt cryptocurrency company Celsius Network initiated a massive sell-off worth about $125 million ETH. Following this large-scale transfer, Ethereum\u2019s price experienced a major decline.\n\nWith the price of Ethereum slowly approaching its peak value, if a similar sell-off phase occurs, it could potentially trigger a shift in market sentiment, pushing investors to opt for other major cryptocurrencies as they attempt to diversify their portfolios and avoid risks.\n\nETH\u2019s Price Update\n\nRecently, Ethereum has been witnessing significant gains, driving its price closer to its previous all-time high of $4,379 in May 2021. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been aggressively following Bitcoin\u2019s recent bullish uptrend, reinforcing its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the space.\n\nVarious analysts have consistently made bullish predictions about the price of Ethereum, with the majority expecting the cryptocurrency to surge above $5,000 soon. Considering the multiple upgrades and developmental activities ongoing within the Ethereum blockchain, a price surge to $4,000 seems probable.\n\nIn the advent that Ethereum reaches its \u201ctop in\u201d, the cryptocurrency may undergo a sell-off phase, as investors seek to maximize profits by cashing out their investments. This could lead to a price reversal, with persistent selling pressures diminishing demand and instigating Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) among traders and investors."

These transfers can often be related to redistributing funds across different platforms or for charitable causes. Hence, while it is intriguing to monitor such high-profile transactions, they should not be directly correlated with market predictions or individual investment strategies.\n\nTurning to the Ethereum price chart, the currency has demonstrated robust performance in recent days. The chart depicts a sharp incline in ETH's value, breaking through previous resistance levels with conviction.\n\nThe currency's price has soared past significant milestones, with traders and investors showing bullish sentiment. This surge aligns with a broader trend of increased adoption and acceptance of Ethereum as a cornerstone of the blockchain and DeFi ecosystems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum's moving averages provide a technical confirmation of this bullish trend, with shorter-term averages positioned above longer-term ones, indicating sustained buying pressure.\n\nThe volume bars corroborate this movement, with substantial activity accompanying the price increase.

Decisions on the products are postponed until May at the earliest, with VanEck\u2019s filing leading the queue. The SEC\u2019s approval or rejection by May 23 will influence other issuers, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January marked a significant development after years of rejections. This decision, influenced by a Grayscale lawsuit against the SEC, was seen as a turning point in legitimizing crypto adoption and investment in the United States."

        "content": "Solana's trading volume exceeded Ethereum's, hitting $2 billion in 24 hours.\n\nDespite a decline in new token creations, established memecoins on Solana are seeing significant price rallies.\n\nThe rivalry between Solana and Ethereum intensifies as memecoins become a key factor in onchain trading preferences.\n\nA memecoin frenzy has once again pushed Solana trading volumes higher than those on Ethereum.\n\nSolana generated $2 billion in volume while Ethereum generated $1.8 billion in the last 24 hours. The blockchain with the next highest volume generated was BNB Chain with $789 million.\n\nDexscreener, an analytics platform monitoring trading on decentralised exchanges, reports that within the top 20 trading pairs, Solana\u2019s memecoin volume reached $178 million, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s $138 million over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe top memecoins by volume in the last 24 hours on Solana are WIF, POPCAT, BONK, TRUMP and WEN. All of these memecoins, besides TRUMP, were launched over a month ago.\n\nPrice history for memecoin BONK\n\nMemecoins are cryptocurrencies that draw their inspiration from internet memes, pop culture phenomena, and trends that have gone viral.\n\nThis ongoing competition underscores a significant shift in onchain trading, highlighting Solana and Ethereum\u2019s rivalry in becoming the dominant platform for memecoin trading.\n\nThis tug of war not only reflects the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets but also points to the growing influence of memecoins in shaping trading volumes and platform preferences.\n\nThe first time Solana surpassed Ethereum in trading volume was on December 14, and since then it has passed Ethereum\u2019s volume on 11 different days.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe usual suspects\n\nWhile trading volumes during Solana\u2019s boom in December were dominated by an influx of newly launched coins, mostly memecoins, this is no longer the case.\n\nNewly created tokens on Solana in December peaked at 7,900, while today, only 2,500 new tokens were created on Solana. This shows that trading volumes on Solana are concentrated in already existing coins.\n\nOne memecoin that has made a dramatic comeback is dogwifhat, WIF, a memecoin created referencing a popular internet meme of a dog in a pink knitted hat.\n\nWIF reached an all-time high on February 14 of $0.46 before falling 39% to $0.28 on February 23. Since then, WIF rallied 571% to reach $1.88 earlier today.\n\nAnother Solana darling memecoin, BONK, experienced similar price gains. BONK is up 51% on the day, reaching an all-time high of $0.000045, giving it a fully diluted valuation of over $3.6 billion.\n\nSimilar gains were seen with Ethereum memecoins last week, with some of those memecoins, like PEPE and DOGE, continuing their gains into this week.\n\nGot a tip about DeFi?

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has historically been a bellwether for upcoming corrections in the market landscape of Ethereum. Recently, the foundation made an unexpected move by liquidating approximately $13 million worth of Ethereum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum, on a daily time frame, is displaying a strong uptrend characterized by consistent higher highs and higher lows. The Moving Average lines are positioned in a manner that suggests sustained bullish momentum. The 50-day MA (in blue) is above the 100-day MA (in orange), which in turn is above the 200-day MA (in black), a configuration that traditionally signals a bullish trend.\n\nFurthermore, the price of Ethereum has been trading comfortably above these MAs, reinforcing the strength of the uptrend. A closer analysis reveals that Ethereum's price recently hit a peak, followed by a slight retracement. While such pullbacks are normal within an uptrend, they often present moments of tension as the market anticipates the next move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Relative Strength Index is hovering near overbought territory, indicating that the market may be due for a correction. This is where the recent operation by the Ethereum Foundation becomes particularly salient.\n\nIf we follow the history, the foundation's large transfers have been associated with preceding market downturns. While the direct correlation between the foundation's actions and market response cannot be verified with absolute certainty, seasoned investors are likely to tread with caution.\n\nThe market's reaction to the Ethereum Foundation's sell-off will be telling. Should the price sustain above the key MAs, it might indicate that the bull run still has legs. However, if the price begins to close below these MAs, particularly the 50-day MA, it could signal the onset of a larger correction."

        "title": "How Safe Is the Layer-2 Blast Solution on Ethereum? - Bitrates",
        "content": "The latest controversy in the crypto universe revolves around Ethereum, the token whose blockchain is revolutionizing technology.\n\nAlthough nothing really notable happened with the cryptocurrency recently, besides the ETF failure due to the SEC\u2019s continuous delay, now Ethereum is on a spree due to the layer-2 system that seems to have caught people\u2019s attention more than it should\u2019ve. Many users have already entered their funds within the project, even though Blast will be delivered only next year around March.\n\nDue to this boom, the price of Ethereum on Binance suffered significant rising stats, but this doesn\u2019t seem to go on for much longer. That\u2019s because some users are skeptical about the reliability of this project due to what appears to be a Ponzi scheme. Not only that, but some investors believe the layer-2 solution isn\u2019t safe at all. Since the project is barely new, it\u2019s hard to say if that\u2019s the truth, which is why we\u2019ll get into analyzing Blast more.\n\nWhat is Blast, and why was it necessary?\n\nBlast is part of the layer-2 solutions on Ethereum responsible for keeping the blockchain safe while ensuring users\u2019 profits are well managed. The project aims to provide a better environment for native staking on Ethereum while focusing on yields that incentivize users. Besides regular staking rewards, investors might also receive DAI stablecoins, therefore diversifying their portfolios.\n\nLayer-2 network solutions are plenty on Ethereum, from zk-rollups to optimistic ones. Their purpose on the mainnet is to maintain security, lower transaction fees, and expand use cases for the network. All these actions work together to improve scalability and make the ecosystem work a seamless place for all users. Indeed, despite all efforts, Ethereum can sometimes be slow, which is why additional updates are being created. However, Blast seems to be more than that.\n\nUsers looking for Blast points and yields\n\nThe main reasons investors blew up Blast include the possibility of getting points and receiving more funds. This is also why some people are skeptical of this project because it seems to be based on a pyramid scheme. Basically, if you enter the system and invite more friends who also fund Blast, you\u2019ll receive a considerable percentage of points, which will go up if your friends ask more people. Hence, it may be possible that some will get wealthier and withdraw more money when Blast is present on the market due to their connections.\n\nMoreover, the Blast points are accompanied by a mechanism that generates yields, which are being staked on a liquid staking protocol, Lido. The company announced that users who deposit their ETH on the pool will receive 5% stablecoin yields.\n\nWhat should users be wary of before depositing their funds to Blast?\n\nAn impressive number of investors turned to Blast as soon as it was announced, which boosted the project considerably, but maybe not all were prepared to take risks. That\u2019s because immediately after the astonishing cost boom, experts and crypto enthusiasts perceived Blast as a dangerous investment considering some aspects of Blast.\n\nFirst, the developer\u2019s contract ownership has five signers, for which most of the three can execute a transaction. Still, it\u2019s a matter of safety if these signer keys are to be trusted, which raises questions on transparency.\n\nAt the same time, the project\u2019s proxy smart contract can always be modified since it has an upgrade function that can be used maliciously. For instance, the developer could take advantage of all the funds gathered without certainty over their trust levels.\n\nFinally, other users found an interesting function within the smart contract that could be used as a\n\npotential exploit. The mainnetBridge option might provide a path for the creator to receive a considerable amount of ETH and DAI with minimum effort, but this is only an observation made by curious users.\n\nPossible liquidity crisis over Ethereum?\n\nFew crypto experts consider that farmers and investors might trigger a liquidity crisis for Ethereum somewhere around February, one month before the applications\u2019 deployment. Hence, it won\u2019t be possible for investors to withdraw their funds for at least three months after February. That might be because liquidity providers will be waiting for an airdrop, which has been debunked as providing a disappointing yield ratio.\n\nTherefore, the lack of liquidity isn\u2019t a good sign for supposed investors. Liquidity ensures price stability and less asset volatility, so we\u2019re unsure whether Blast will be profitable. What\u2019s worrying is that many investors put their funds to work and expect great results, which isn\u2019t specific for now.\n\nHow will Blast affect Ethereum?\n\nThe layer-2 solution on Ethereum might also have some effects on the blockchain and the cryptocurrency. For instance, it could have been the cause of an increased price, which can be perceived as beneficial. However, since users found weird aspects of the smart contract code, the solution faces security scrutiny due to the unverified chain management whose developers are anonymously working.\n\nBeing dependent so much on the Lido liquid staking protocol isn\u2019t great for a small project because users wonder if their funds are safely managed and secured. Although Lido is a considerable helping booster for solutions like Blast, every funding investment idea should be considered with people\u2019s findings.\n\nInvestors already went through the FTX scandal, so they could learn a thing or two from previous experiences. The conclusion is that it\u2019s always best to be cautious of new projects because they haven\u2019t taken the test of time, so it\u2019s hard to assess whether they\u2019re safe. Indeed, crypto investing is about taking risks, but sometimes, they\u2019re not worth it despite their high-income potential.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nBlast is a new layer-2 solution provided for Ethereum and will ensure native staking and high yields for investors who invite more participants. This made people believe Blast is only a pyramid scheme, mainly because the developer and its team haven\u2019t provided much transparency on the project since its announcement on the market. However, many individuals deposited their funds into it and are now waiting for a significant withdrawal in March 2024."

Select altcoins, especially meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe, and more graced the market with triple-digit gains, accentuating the bullish theory.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, trading above $4,000 during US business hours, is only 22.83% from its record high of $4,891. Ether boasts a 7.2% increase in 24 hours on top of a 16% surge in a week and an impressive 64% in a month.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH is experiencing a staggering accrual in trading volume to $33 billion, with the market cap rising to $456 billion. This significantly underscores the strong fundamental factors backing the current rally, including the Dencun upgrade on March 13.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: ETH Goes Boom Ahead of Dencun Upgrade\n\nEthereum seems poised to break above $4,000 anytime from now. The unstoppable run is mainly buoyed by positive sentiment in the market as Bitcoin price rallies closing in on the all-time high, the anticipation for a spot ETF, and the upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade will take place on March 13 following three successful testnets launches in the past months. This upgrade promises a lot of goodies for the Ethereum ecosystem such as lowering transaction fees on layer 2 protocols.\n\nNetwork congestion will also be addressed with the block size increasing to 25 MB from 12.5 MB. With proto-danksharding, Ethereum will finally address scalability issues.\n\nThe coming days before the upgrade are expected to shape the outlook of Ethereum price, compelling investors to position themselves by buying ETH.\n\nGrowing optimism for a spot Ethereum ETF is another factor driving the price. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs saw investors, stakeholders and potential operators of the products shift their attention to Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to consider greenlighting spot ETH ETFs, further fuelling interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nRecommended: 4 GameFi Rising Altcoins On The Move As Bitcoin Flirts With ATH\n\nAssessing ETH Price Technical Outlook For March\n\nAfter stepping above $3,800, Ethereum price teeters at $3,803. In addition to the bullish sentiment across the market, the uptick in price has been reinforced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator as it rises above the neutral area.\n\nKey bull market indicators like the 20-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the 50-week EMA, and the 200-week EMA are still catching up with the uptrend, signaling that the rally is far from over.\n\nTraders would be interested in the way ETH price reacts to resistance at $3,800 over the coming sessions. A daily close above this level could trigger a larger breakout as bulls target highs above $4,000.\n\nThe expected increase in buying pressure due to the Dencun upgrade will also boost the price towards the all-time high. Hence, the likelihood of Ethereum soaring above $5,000 in quarter 1.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "SEC postponed its verdict on the applications for spot Ethereum ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nPrice of ETH remained unaffected and continued to grow.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to postpone its determination on the approval or rejection of Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) submitted by BlackRock and Fidelity, according to filings made on the 4th of March.\n\nSome delays\n\nIn January, the SEC initially deferred its decision on the Ethereum ETF applications from BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust and Fidelity\u2019s Ethereum Fund, shortly after granting approval for several spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs.\n\nThe regulatory body has the option to delay its decision up to three times before reaching a final verdict.\n\nMarket observers and ETF analysts had long anticipated the SEC\u2019s delay, speculating that a decision on approving or denying the ETFs would likely coincide with the approaching final deadline in May.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart emphasized 23rd May as the crucial date, marking the deadline for VanEck\u2019s spot ETH ETF application.\n\nHowever, opinions vary on the significance of a spot Ether ETF compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF has already amassed an impressive $10 billion in assets under management, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Blachunas expressed reservations about the impact of the yet-to-be-approved Ethereum funds, describing them as \u201csmall potatoes\u201d in comparison to their Bitcoin counterparts.\n\nDespite this, Blachunas and Seyffart planned to provide formal odds on the likelihood of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nPotential impacts\n\nThe prolonged uncertainty surrounding the approval of ETH ETFs can contribute to an atmosphere of unpredictability within the cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors and enthusiasts eagerly await regulatory decisions as they can significantly influence market dynamics. The repeated delays by the SEC may lead to frustration and impatience amongst investors.\n\nMoreover, the delay might be interpreted by some as a lack of regulatory clarity for Ethereum-related financial products.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which recently saw a successful rollout of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the repeated postponements for Ethereum ETFs could create a perception that Ethereum\u2019s regulatory framework is less defined or more challenging to navigate.\n\nThe comparative hesitation and cautiousness of the SEC in approving Ethereum ETFs, especially when contrasted with the swift approval of Bitcoin ETFs, could signal potential concerns or reservations specific to Ethereum.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nDespite these factors, the price of ETH continued to soar. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,469.49 and its price rose by 1.56% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe volume at which ETH was trading had spiked as well and had increased from 12.15 billion to 22.9 billion during this period."

        "content": "Political blowback for approving BTC ETFs could lead to the SEC reconsidering its stance.\n\nThe market was hopeful of approvals in May.\n\nWith the official greenlighting of spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, the digital assets market was looking forward to a similar outcome for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum [ETH].\n\nHowever, amidst a rather upbeat mood, a pessimistic forecast surfaced, casting doubts in the minds of market observers.\n\nETH ETF approvals dicey?\n\nChief Legal Officer of venture fund Variant, Jake Chervinsky, said in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he is a \u201clot less confident\u201d about an ETH ETF approval this year.\n\nThe crypto lawyer, recognized for his informed takes on legal and regulatory events concerning cryptocurrencies, cited potential political repercussions as a factor in lowering the odds of approval.\n\n\u201cThe SEC got a ton of political blowback for approving BTC ETFs, even though the court basically forced it to. Now animal spirits are in control of the market, and an ETH ETF would only add to that.\u201d\n\nThe politics of it all\n\nRecall that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren had fiercely criticized the SEC\u2019s decision to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn an X post on the day that the ETFs were cleared for trading in the U.S., Warren said,\n\n\u201cIf the SEC is going to let crypto burrow even deeper into our financial system, then it\u2019s more urgent than ever that crypto follow basic anti-money laundering rules.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a Democrat, sided with two SEC commissioners from the Republican Party, to hand over a 3:2 vote in favor of the ETFs.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nJust like Bitcoin spot ETFs, titans of the U.S. financial market like BlackRock and Grayscale have expressed their interest in spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered had predicted an approval by the 23rd of May, the final deadline for the first list of ETF applications.\n\nThe team behind the forecast had stated that the path to approval would be pretty much like that of Bitcoin, with the SEC dilly-dallying until eventually giving the go-ahead."

        "content": "The world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum continues on its mega bull run with the ETH price skyrocketing all the way past $3,700. As of press time, ETH is trading 7% up at $3,713 with a market cap of $446 billion.\n\nSEC Delays BlackRock Spot Ethereum ETF Proposal\n\nOn Monday, March 4, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a delay in its decision timeline regarding BlackRock\u2019s proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF. This marks the second postponement of the SEC\u2019s decision on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the SEC has sought public feedback on whether the ETF should be approved, particularly focusing on concerns related to Ethereum\u2019s proof of stake mechanism and its susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.\n\nSimilarly, the SEC has deferred its decision on Fidelity\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF. The agency has requested public comments on this matter, posing similar questions as those raised for BlackRock\u2019s proposal. The public should submit their feedback for both proposals within the next 21 days, with rebuttals expected within 35 days thereafter. May 23, is the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application, which will put greater clarity on the SEC\u2019s decision on the matter.\n\nThere\u2019s a division among crypto experts regarding the potential approval of a spot ether ETF. Optimistic voices suggest that SEC approval could arrive as soon as May, drawing parallels to recent Bitcoin ETF approvals paving the way. However, skeptics maintain a cautious stance, expressing uncertainty about the likelihood of spot ether ETF approvals.\n\nEthereum Price Rally to $4,000 Soon?\n\nConsidering the current Ethereum price action, it is clear that investors have decided to look past the Ethereum ETF approval for now. The most important event ahead is the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade in a week or two.\n\nEthereum has surged above the $3,650 mark, surpassing the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the hourly chart of ETH/USD, a bullish trend line is forming, with support emerging around $3,600. This trend line closely aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent upward movement from the $3,465 swing low to the $3,715 high.\n\nLooking ahead, immediate resistance is anticipated near the $3,720 level, with the first significant hurdle at around $3,780. Beyond that, a major resistance zone lies near $3,850, signaling potential bullish momentum if breached. Further upside could see Ethereum targeting the $3,920 level.\n\nIn the event of a breakthrough above the $3,920 resistance level, Ether might potentially surge towards the $4,000 resistance. Further upward momentum could prompt a test of the $4,200 mark.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "title": "DeFi community gets buzzed at ETHDenver on interoperability and Kennedy - DLNews",
        "content": "DeFi came out big time this year at 'best ETHDenver ever.'\n\nBitcoin advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made his pitch for crypto-loving voters.\n\nInteroperability is back as borders between crypto projects blur.\n\nCrypto conferences are one of the few times investors get to see the faces behind the $2.5 trillion industry.\n\nAmong these exposures, ETHDenver is the biggest \u2014 last year saw 15,000 attendees from more than 115 different countries.\n\nWith an increasingly saturated circuit of crypto events spanning several continents, you might think attendees would be getting bored \u2014 not so. Creating a decentralised, permissionless, and scalable way to transact value is an iterative process, and no one knows that better than Ethereum\u2019s faithful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best ETHDenver yet,\u201d said many of the attendees I spoke to, ranging from crypto executives, to curious dabblers, and even some of my fellow journalists.\n\nCleansing rally\n\nSoaking up the vibe in ETHDenver, it\u2019s hard to believe that just a few months ago crypto\u2019s fortunes looked very, very different.\n\nPlunging valuations, the FTX collapse, and a spate of costly hacks was causing even the most die-hard believers to question if crypto would come back.\n\nBut a rally has a way of wiping the slate clean. In the month leading up to the event, Ethereum experienced a 50% tear, taking the asset to its highest price since early 2022.\n\nAs a first timer at Spork Castle, the affectionately named main event hall, my only point of reference was EthCC, the biggest European Ethereum conference with limited tickets that cost upwards of $500.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThe free-to-enter ETHDenver had a decidedly more American feel.\n\nThe food on offer was sugary, greasy and gut-busting. Beers cost $15, and politics was ever present.\n\nThis year even commanded a much-hyped, and perhaps last minute addition of a press conference and fireside chat with independent presidential hopeful Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2014 or RFK Jr to many of his supporters.\n\nSo with the cool Colorado breeze in my hair, I ventured past the bomb-sniffer dogs and metal detectors to see what ETHDenver could tell me about the state of the crypto industry and those investing in it.\n\nKennedy comes to ETHDenver\n\nWhen I found out there was to be an exclusive press conference with Kennedy at ETHDenver, my feelings were mixed.\n\nStill, I couldn\u2019t not go, it would be journalistic malpractice. And in the end, I\u2019m very glad that I did.\n\nOn an unusually warm Saturday afternoon, Kennedy emerged from behind a black curtain in a back room of the conference, surrounded by several intimidating looking bodyguards with earpieces.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks to the press at ETHDenver. Photocredit: Tim Craig/ DL News (DL News)\n\nHis voice sounded frail and raspy, which I later learned was due to his spasmodic dysphonia, a voice disorder that gives his speech a strained quality.\n\nStill, the presidential hopeful maintained his composure and it wasn\u2019t long before he was drawing out laughs from the crowd.\n\nOne reporter offered a winding question about what Kennedy was doing to make himself a more appealing candidate to crypto supporters.\n\n\u201cWell, I came here,\u201d he pointedly said in return.\n\nWhen it was my turn to ask a question, I probed the candidate on his staunch environmental beliefs and support of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen it was my turn to ask a question, I probed the candidate on his staunch environmental beliefs and support of Bitcoin, which, despite much improvement in recent years, still relies heavily on non-renewable energy.\n\nTo my surprise, his answer hit all the right talking points. He explained how sustainable Bitcoin mining can help subsidise green energy projects by monetising the excess energy. It was clear Kennedy\u2019s understanding and support of crypto was more than superficial \u2014 he gets it.\n\nHowever, immediately after, he dealt with a joke question about whether Bitcoin causes autism perhaps a little less well.\n\n\u201cCorrelation does not equal causation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe science is still up for debate?\u201d the asker said.\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nHis response was clearly in jest. But the exchange and the topic reminded me of Kennedy\u2019s previous track record of promoting public health conspiracy theories, something which many of his supporters at the event seemed desperate to overrule.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not anti-vax,\u201d one volunteer at the Kennedy booth told me. \u201cYou have to think, did I hear him say that, or was it the mainstream media?\u201d\n\nFrom left to right, Paul Frambot of Morpho Labs, Devin Walsh of the Uniswap Foundation, and Sam MacPherson of Spark Protocol discuss how DeFi scales at a panel moderated by Tim Craig at ETHDenver on March 1. Photocredit: DL News\n\nI asked why she and others had come to ETHDenver to campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d she said, drawing a broad comparison to the general malaise people in crypto have with the existing financial system.\n\nAn idea I heard several times during the conference was that the crypto-initiated and Kennedy supporters have a lot in common \u2014 they\u2019re both offering an alternative to the existing order whether that be the two-party system in Washington or the monetary policies of central banks across the globe.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if RFK represented a real alternative. But judging by the amount of pin badge clad attendees, many at ETHDenver certainly did.\n\nYounger generations want a plan B\n\nConferences like ETHDenver are renowned for their side events, lavish and often unofficial parties hosted by companies with excessive marketing budgets or crypto whales looking to flaunt their wealth.\n\nConsensys, the company behind the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, invited me to their event, a modest happy hour at a local hotel bar.\n\nOne MetaMask employee, who said he was 50, brought up how he had struggled to get other people his age excited about crypto.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had it too good for too long,\u201d he theorised. The reason younger generations are interested, he said, was because they \u201cneed a plan B.\u201d\n\nCertainly, millennials are the primary owners of crypto, with a recent study revealing over 76% of crypto buyers were aged between 25 and 40.\n\nMillennials, the most populous generation in US history, are also enduring slow wage growth, unaffordable housing, and soaring prices due to emergency spending during the pandemic.\n\nAfter the event, I was invited to a semi-secret Consensys house party, which I was assured would be a wild time.\n\nI\u2019d heard rumours that the night before members of the Bitcoin maximalist crowd \u2014 crypto fans who denounce all other cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin \u2014 had hosted their own raucous house party where attendees reportedly dyed their hair orange and got spur-of-the-moment Bitcoin tattoos.\n\nBut at Denver\u2019s 6,000 foot elevation, alcohol hits a bit harder than you\u2019re used to, so after three drinks I decided to call it a night.\n\nETHDenver, or everyone Denver?\n\nLike the broader crypto ecosystem, the lines between different projects are becoming increasingly blurred. And ETHDenver, which started in 2018 as a close-knit event for Ethereum\u2019s diehard fans and builders, is also following this trend.\n\nProjects like Solana, Polkadot, which have both been lauded as \u201cEthereum killers\u201d in the past had pitched camp on the booth floor and hosted official ETHDenver events.\n\nTheir presence, I thought, reflected the push towards interoperability happening within the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nChains such as Solana and Ethereum, which used to be closed off from each other due to their different software implementations, are now easy to transverse between thanks to specialised protocols like Wormhole, LayerZero, and Axelar.\n\nSo it only made sense that I should be able to chat with the team behind top Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum and then find Solana developers right around the corner.\n\nEver-present tribalism\n\nMy inner cynic knows the reason for so much diversity at an Ethereum conference was purely financial. As long as a project has got the dough, they can buy as many booths and sponsorships as they want.\n\nBut at the same time, I wondered if the situation also had some positives, and that it might be helping to break down the ever-present tribalism and feuding between different blockchains and DeFi protocols.\n\nThen again, Denver is a city where you can\u2019t walk two blocks without a waft of cannabis invading your nostrils, so it could\u2019ve just been that.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum Foundation Dumps $13 Million Worth of ETH; Is a Sell-Off Ahead? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has executed a significant transaction, liquidating $13.3 million worth of Ethereum (ETH), which has caught the attention of investors and market analysts alike. This move by the foundation, known for its influential role in the cryptocurrency sector, has sparked discussions regarding its potential impact on Ethereum\u2019s market position.\n\nDespite the sale, Ethereum has shown resilience with a bullish trend, currently trading at $3580.74. This represents a 14.6% increase over the past week, with a robust market capitalization of $420 billion and holding a 17.8% dominance in the crypto market, as reported by CoinGecko.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has also seen substantial gains, rising over 28% in the last seven days and nearing its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. The current BTC price hovers around the $67,000 mark, highlighting a period of overall growth in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nUpcoming Ethereum Network Update and Market Dynamics\n\nAs the Ethereum network gears up for the Dencun update, a combination of the Cancun and Deneb updates, the cryptocurrency community is closely watching the potential effects on Ethereum\u2019s scalability, efficiency, and security. This update, scheduled for March 13, aims to reduce layer-2 transaction fees significantly. The Ethereum Foundation has already successfully upgraded test networks, signaling readiness for the mainnet activation.\n\nEthereum\u2019s user base continues to expand, with 1.8 million new users joining the network last month, increasing the total number of ETH holders to 115.5 million addresses. This growth contrasts Bitcoin\u2019s slight decrease in wallet addresses, underscoring ETH\u2019s strengthening market presence. The reduction in Ethereum\u2019s exchange supply by $2.3 billion further sets a positive stage for its price trajectory, potentially pushing it towards the $4,000 mark in March 2024.\n\nRegulatory Landscape and Future Prospects\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector closely monitors the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it engages with applicants for spot Ethereum ETFs later this month. This meeting is crucial for determining the future of Ethereum-based investment products, with decisions expected to be postponed until May at the earliest. The SEC\u2019s handling of these applications, including those from leading firms like VanEck, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy, will be pivotal in shaping the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States.\n\nFollowing a landmark lawsuit by Grayscale against the SEC, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January marked a significant moment in the broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. The upcoming decisions regarding spot Ethereum ETFs are anticipated to further influence the market dynamics and regulatory stance towards cryptocurrencies in the U.S., with potential implications for Ethereum\u2019s market performance and investor sentiment.\n\nRead Also: Anthropic Launches Chatbot To Rival ChatGPT and Google Bard\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Ethereum price rallied toward $3,850 before crashing. ETH followed Bitcoin, but the bulls are now active near the $3,350 support zone.\n\nEthereum traded to a new multi-month high above $3,800 before crashing.\n\nThe price is trading near $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could resume its increase if it clears the $3,600 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum Price Takes Major Hit\n\nEthereum price extended its rally above the $3,650 level, like Bitcoin. BTC surged and even traded to a new all-time high above $69,000. ETH also cleared the $3,800 level before the bears appeared.\n\nThere was a strong bearish reaction from the $3,827 high. The price crashed over $500 and traded toward the $3,200 support. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $3,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nA low was formed at $3,211 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $3,500 level. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,827 swing high to the $3,211 low. Ethereum is now trading near $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance on the upside is near the $3,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,600 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,827 swing high to the $3,211 low.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe next major resistance is near $3,680, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. The next stop for the bulls could be near the $3,820 level. If there is a move above the $3,820 resistance, Ether could even rally toward the $3,950 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,000.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,600 resistance, it could start another downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,440 level.\n\nThe first major support is near the $3,400 zone. The next key support could be the $3,340 zone.

        "title": "Ethereum Classic (ETC): The Original Ethereum? - Markets.com",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a prominent cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in recent years. To understand the significance of Ethereum Classic, it is crucial to go deep into the history of Ethereum and the infamous DAO attack that led to the creation of two separate cryptocurrencies: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe History of Ethereum and the DAO Attack\n\nIn 2015, Ethereum was introduced to the world as a blockchain-based platform that allowed the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It quickly gained popularity and became a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. However, in 2016, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was launched on the Ethereum platform.\n\nThe DAO was a revolutionary concept that aimed to create a decentralized venture capital fund. It raised a staggering amount of funds through a token sale, but unfortunately, it was exploited, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether (ETH). This incident shook the Ethereum community to its core and forced the developers to make a difficult decision.\n\nThe Split: Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic\n\nIn response to the DAO attack, the Ethereum community proposed a controversial solution - a hard fork. This involved creating a new version of the Ethereum blockchain that would reverse the transactions associated with the DAO attack and return the stolen Ether to the rightful owners. This new version became known as Ethereum (ETH).\n\nHowever, not everyone in the Ethereum community agreed with the decision to perform a hard fork. A group of dedicated individuals believed that the principles of immutability and censorship resistance, which were the foundation of the blockchain, had been compromised.\n\nAs a result, they decided to continue using the original Ethereum blockchain, which became known as Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nUnderstanding the Principles of Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) stands for the preservation of the original principles of Ethereum. It upholds the belief that blockchain transactions should be immutable and free from interference, even in the face of catastrophic events like the DAO attack.\n\nEthereum Classic supporters argue that tampering with the blockchain undermines its core values and erodes trust in the technology.\n\nBy maintaining the original Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum Classic aims to provide a reliable and unchanging platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It emphasizes the importance of transparency, security, and self-governance, making it an attractive choice for those who value the fundamental principles of blockchain technology.\n\nThe Key Differences between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum Classic and Ethereum share a common origin, several key differences set them apart. The most significant difference lies in their approach to governance.\n\nEthereum Classic adopts a hands-off approach, allowing the community to make decisions collectively, while Ethereum has implemented a more centralized governance model.\n\nAnother notable difference is the approach to scalability. Ethereum Classic has chosen to prioritize security and decentralization over scalability, whereas Ethereum has implemented various solutions, such as the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, to address scalability concerns.\n\nThe Development and Community behind Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic's development and community have grown steadily over the years. The Ethereum Classic Development Team (ETCDEV) plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving the Ethereum Classic blockchain. They focus on enhancing security, developing new features, and fostering the growth of a vibrant ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Classic community is composed of passionate individuals who believe in the principles of immutability and decentralization. They actively contribute to the development of Ethereum Classic by participating in discussions, proposing improvements, and building decentralized applications on the platform.\n\nUse Cases and Applications of Ethereum Classic\n\nEthereum Classic has a range of potential use cases and applications. Its robust smart contract capabilities make it suitable for a variety of decentralized applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and identity verification systems. The immutability of the Ethereum Classic blockchain also makes it an ideal platform for storing permanent records, such as land ownership records or academic credentials.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum Classic's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily port existing Ethereum dApps to the Ethereum Classic platform, expanding its range of potential applications even further.\n\nInvesting in Ethereum Classic: Pros and Cons\n\nInvesting in Ethereum Classic comes with its own set of pros and cons. On the positive side, Ethereum Classic has a dedicated community and development team, which bodes well for its long-term growth. Additionally, its focus on immutability and decentralization may attract individuals who value these principles.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with investing in Ethereum Classic. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and Ethereum Classic is no exception. Furthermore, Ethereum Classic faces competition from other blockchain platforms, which may impact its adoption and value.\n\nFuture Prospects and Challenges for Ethereum Classic\n\nLooking ahead, Ethereum Classic faces both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the increasing adoption of blockchain technology and the growth of decentralized finance present exciting prospects for Ethereum Classic. As more applications are built on the platform, its value and utility may continue to rise.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum Classic must overcome challenges such as scalability and interoperability to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and potential security vulnerabilities are factors that need to be addressed to ensure the long-term success of Ethereum Classic.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) holds a significant place in the blockchain ecosystem. Its commitment to preserving the principles of immutability and decentralization resonates with individuals who value the core tenets of blockchain technology. By providing a reliable and unchanging platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts, Ethereum Classic contributes to the growth and evolution of the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.\n\nAs the blockchain industry continues to mature, Ethereum Classic will face both opportunities and challenges. However, its dedicated community, passionate development team, and adherence to its core principles provide a solid foundation for its continued success. Whether it becomes a mainstream platform or remains a niche choice, Ethereum Classic's significance in the blockchain ecosystem cannot be ignored.\n\nDive into our CFD trading products and services to find the right one for you!\n\nStart Trading Now Start to trade now Join the 100.000s that have made markets.com their home for trading.

        "content": "The total crypto market capitalization is closing in on the $2.5 trillion threshold underpinned by a Bitcoin price surge above $65,000 on Monday. Although bullish, the Ethereum price prediction reveals a struggling second-largest cryptocurrency, which has since last week oscillated between support at $3,400 and resistance at $3,550.\n\nIn the meantime, select meme coins including Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and PEPE are charging forward, shaping the altcoin landscape.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDogecoin secured its position in the top ten, boasting a 12.5% in its cap to $22.8 billion. The ninth-largest crypto\u2019s $5 billion 24-hour trading volume underlines growing interest among traders and investors.\n\nShiba Inu and Pepe Coin\u2019s last week\u2019s rally was unstoppable over the weekend, with the former peaking at $0.00002263, and the latter achieving a new all-time high of $0.000007583, according to CoinMarketCap market data.\n\nRecommended: SHIB, BONK, FLOKI Price Analysis As Memecoin Rally Leads Crypto Market Cap to $2.5 Trillion\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Is There A Way Out For ETH Bulls?\n\nEthereum performed exceptionally well in January and February buoyed by growing optimism for the spot ETF. Investors turned to Ethereum following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, with many believing that it will not be long until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers a spot ETH ETF.\n\nIn addition to the ETF, the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13 could be a major market mover for Ethereum price. With this protocol upgrade, Ethereum will tackle the issue of scalability by increasing the block size from 12.5 MB to 25 MB.\n\nLayer 2 scaling networks like Arbitrum and Polygon will benefit the most from the Dencun upgrade promising cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nIn the previous week, Ethereum moved in tandem with Bitcoin as it tested resistance in the range between $3,500 and $3,600. At the time, BTC launched above $60,000 and tested $64,000 before settling for sideways oscillation above short-term support at $62,000.\n\nWhile an aggressive Bitcoin ascended above $65,000 on Monday, Ethereum struggled to clear resistance at $3,500 with the area at $3,550 emerging as a new sell-wall.\n\nTrading at $3,490 during US business hours on Monday, Ethereum needs to close above $3,500 to convince investors that the upturned is intact. Otherwise, a longer sideways trend may start to form to allow for fresh re-accumulation to boost the next leg up targeting highs above $4,000 and the record high around $4,890.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) reinforces the bullish theory. Although slightly overbought at 81, the RSI backs the current uptrend, suggesting that ETH\u2019s sideways doldrums may not last long.\n\nAccording to the Money Flow Index (MFI) the inflow and outflow of money into Ethereum are equal and canceling out, which explains the current sideways trading.\n\nTraders need a confirmation of movement above $3,500 to go all-in on ETH and bet on the price rallying to close the distance to $4,000. Other key levels to watch out for are the hurdles at $3,600 and $3,800. On the downside, support levels stand at $3,400 and $3,200, respectively.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Ethereum in the spotlight as weekly crypto inflows tap $1.84B - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Investment inflows linked to Ethereum rose to $85 million.\n\nThe price of ETH surpassed $3,600 and could hit $4,000 soon.\n\nLast week, digital asset investment products registered a total inflow of $1.84 billion. During the timeframe which ended on the 1st of March, Ethereum [ETH] hit its highest inflow since July 2022.\n\nAccording to the report provided by CoinShares, total trading volume hit $30 billion, indicating high interest in cryptocurrency-related products.\n\nHowever, most of the inflows went to Bitcoin [BTC] which accounted for 94% of the total. But short Bitcoin inflows also jumped, indicating that some investors were bearish on the coin. The report read,\n\n\u201c94% of the inflows were into Bitcoin, totalling US$1.72bn, although recent price moves saw short investors double down with a further US$22m inflows into short-bitcoin investment products.\u201d\n\nETFs offer the confidence\n\nFor Ethereum, its total inflows were about $85 million. The notable increase suggests that investors were looking to ETH exposure as the deadline to approve spot Ethereum ETFs nears. However, the Assets under Management (AuM) was shy of its all-time peak.\n\nFurthermore, AMBCrypto observed that the AuM hit $14.6 billion. But it was still far off the high of $23.7 billion. This number implies that the value of Ethereum funds controlled by institutions was still lagging.\n\nHowever, if the U.S. SEC approves the Ethereum ETFs, this position might change and the total AuM value might go higher. But as of this writing, there were rumors that the SEC might delay the applications.\n\nIn terms of the price action, ETH\u2019s value has been increasing. At press time, ETH changed hands at $3,696, thanks to a 14.66% increase in the last seven days.\n\nVolume increases as ETH eyes a higher value\n\nWhen it comes to the volume, on-chain data showed that it has been increasing. As of this writing, ETH\u2019s volume was 31.69 billion.\n\nIf the volume continues to increase alongside ETH\u2019s price, then a higher value might appear in the short term. In a highly bullish scenario, ETH might cross the $4,000 mark within a few weeks.\n\nDespite the bullish sentiment, traders might need to be careful. If ETH slides below $3,500, the bullish thesis could be invalidated. Though it seems unlikely, it remains an option to watch out for.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the total AuM hit $82.6bn. This was only a little away from the $86bn peak which occurred in early November 2021. If the inflows continue to increase as it had done since the beginning of the year, the AuM might surpass the 2021 high.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nIn addition, other altcoins were also involved in the flows. While Polygon [MATIC] had more inflows, Solana [SOL] registered high outflows:"

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cardano market has recently showcased a trend that could be cause for concern among its investors. A noticeable decrease in trading volume suggests that the momentum behind ADA's recent price rally may be waning, potentially signaling an upcoming period of volatility and price correction.\n\nThe declining volume trend is a critical red flag in technical analysis, often indicating a lack of conviction in the asset's ability to sustain its current price levels. As trading activity diminishes, the support that has propelled ADA\u2019s price higher becomes increasingly fragile. This situation can lead to a scenario where even a minor sell-off could trigger a disproportionate price drop, as fewer buyers might be present to absorb the sell orders.\n\nA closer look at the ADA price chart reveals that while the currency has been experiencing an upward trajectory, the diminishing volume could signify that this rally might not have a strong foundation. The recent surge in ADA's price could be at risk if the market does not regain its trading volume to reinforce the uptrend.\n\nCardano's price is testing a critical resistance level. If the trading volume continues to fall, there is a possibility that ADA will lose support and enter a severe correction. The support levels that were previously reliable may not hold if they are tested again with a low volume, leading to potential massive losses for those holding the asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum to face issues?\n\nEthereum has been riding a wave of bullish momentum, but as the old adage goes, what goes up must come down \u2014 or at least take a breather. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen a sharp rally in its price, but with such steep ascents come concerns about sustainability and the potential for a reversal.\n\nThe current state of Ethereum's rally is one of caution. The momentum indicators, while still in bullish territories, are beginning to show signs that the rally may be overextended. The RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, is nearing levels that typically indicate overbought conditions, which could precede a price correction.\n\nFor Ethereum, support levels are now established at $2,993, $2,653 and $2,515, which would be crucial to watch if a downturn begins. A healthy correction would potentially see Ethereum's price retesting these levels, confirming their strength and providing a possible accumulation point for investors.\n\nSolana holds tight\n\nAs Solana encounters a minor price correction at the $128 threshold, there are indicators suggesting that this could be the precursor to a more extended reversal. This notion is based on a detailed examination of its recent price action, which reveals that SOL's impressive climb could be tapering off.\n\nThe support and resistance levels for SOL have become increasingly relevant in recent trading sessions. After hitting resistance around $128, SOL experienced a pullback, which has left investors and analysts speculating about the possibility of a trend reversal. The support levels at $112 and $103, previously serving as solid grounds during SOL's ascent, are now being scrutinized as potential retest points in the event of a further price decline.\n\nAnalyzing the current trend through technical indicators shows a reduction in trading volume accompanying the price dip. This decreased volume could signal a weakening buying pressure, which, when coupled with the resistance met at $128, heightens the probability of a trend reversal. If the volume continues to decline and the price fails to break past the resistance level with conviction, SOL could indeed be on the cusp of a reversal.\n\nLooking forward, if the market sentiment shifts and the price of SOL breaks below the $112 support, this could confirm the bearish scenario, potentially leading to a prolonged retracement. Such a correction would not be out of the ordinary, as it would allow the market to consolidate after the recent rally and could potentially provide healthier long-term growth for SOL."

This surge, observed in February, recorded the longest monthly green candle in Bitcoin\u2019s history, showcasing the strength of its upward momentum. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has soared to a staggering $1.244 trillion, consolidating its position as the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market with a dominance of 52.36%.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the last 24 hours alone, trading volume spiked by 65.6% to reach $34.75 billion, indicating heightened activity and investor interest. The BTC-spot ETF market witnessed substantial net inflows, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) contributing a significant $2,050.5 million. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) experienced a surge in net outflows, amounting to $1,455.7 million.\n\nThis outflow was attributed to Genesis Global Holdco LLC\u2019s liquidation of GBTC shares, signaling shifting investor sentiments and market dynamics. Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally saw it breaking through multiple support levels, particularly at $40,000, to surpass the $65,000 milestone.

        "content": "Prominent whales have switched from Bitcoin to Ethereum.\n\nEthereum ETFs and the Dencun upgrade may have had a part to play.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bitcoin [BTC] has been the primary focus for both retail and whale investors, capturing significant attention with its soaring prices.\n\nHowever, recent data suggested a shift in sentiment, as Ethereum [ETH] emerged on the radar of whale investors.\n\nWhales switch their stance\n\nAccording to data from Lookonchain, a substantial move occurred as a whale transitioned from a bullish stance on BTC to adopting a bullish position on ETH.\n\nThis strategic shift involved exchanging 1,500 ETH for 88.68 WBTC, totaling $4.58 million on the 26th of February, with the intent of shorting the ETH/BTC pair.\n\nFollowing this initial maneuver, the whale executed another exchange, converting the acquired 88.68 WBTC back to 1,597 ETH, valued at $5.57 million.\n\nThis adjustment resulted in a net gain of 97 ETH, amounting to $338,000.\n\nThis transition to Ethereum aligned with the growing anticipation around Ethereum ETF approvals and heightened excitement surrounding the Dencun upgrade.\n\nThese factors could potentially attract more interest and investment into Ethereum, positioning it as a favorable asset in the eyes of both retail and institutional investors.\n\nHowever, despite this positive sentiment, Ethereum faced challenges, notably the persistently high gas fees, on its network.\n\nThese fees have been a point of concern, potentially impacting investor sentiment negatively, especially for smaller traders looking to engage in transactions.\n\nThe high fees could force users to look for lower-cost alternatives such as Solana [SOL], which may impact Ethereum in the long run.\n\nLooking at ETH\n\nDespite this, gas usage on the Ethereum network remained relatively consistent over the last few days.\n\nExamining the price movement, Ethereum was trading at $3,469.49 at the time of writing, exhibiting a growth of 1.56% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhile positive price movement was encouraging, other concerning issues emerged.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s Network Growth saw a decline, indicating reduced interest from new addresses.\n\nThis may pose a challenge to Ethereum\u2019s sustained growth, raising questions about the broader market sentiment around the altcoin."

        "content": "Tue 05 Mar 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Nicolas T.\n\nThe SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has postponed its decision regarding the approval of BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF.\n\nEthereum ETF\n\nThis is the second postponement for BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum ETF. The first was in January, shortly after the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC can postpone its decision up to three times before having to make a final verdict.\n\nThe deadline will be May 23rd. It will concern VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that May 23rd is the \u201conly date that matters\u201d:\n\nSEC just delayed @InvescoUS & @galaxyhq's #Ethereum ETF. 100% expected and more delays will continue to happen in coming months.\n\n\n\nThe only date that matters for spot #ethereum ETFs at this time is May 23rd. Which is @vaneck_us's final deadline date pic.twitter.com/gkVZL2QuPK \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) February 6, 2024\n\nTo him, \u201call decisions before this date will be adjournments.\u201d \u201cPersonally, I can\u2019t imagine them rejecting VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF and then approve those of the competitors.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that the SEC is going to launch a public consultation to decide whether it should approve Ethereum ETFs or not. Concerns are particularly focused on the potential for fraud and manipulation associated with the Proof-of-Stake mechanism.\n\nAnother point to note is that the ETF applications are based on the premise that Ethereum is a \u201ccommodity\u201d. Here is what can be read in the SEC\u2019s statement published this Monday, March 4th:\n\n\u201cOn November 21, 2023, Nasdaq submitted to the SEC an ETF application aiming to list shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust under the name Nasdaq Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\u201d\n\nHowever, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently refused to classify Ethereum as a \u201ccommodity\u201d. Here are his remarks following the reluctant validation of Bitcoin ETFs:\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the Commission\u2019s decision is limited to ETFs backed by a \u2018commodity\u2019, bitcoin, and not a \u2018security\u2019. It should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve ETFs for crypto-assets [Ethereum] that fall under the securities laws.\u201d\n\nNo ETH ETF until 2025?\n\nVariant\u2019s legal director for the crypto company, Jake Chervinsky, doubts an ETH ETF could be approved this year:\n\nI am a lot less confident about ETH ETF approval this year than many of you are.\n\n\n\nThe SEC got a ton of political blowback for approving BTC ETFs, even though the court basically forced it to.\n\n\n\nNow animal spirits are in control of the market, and an ETH ETF would only add to that. \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) March 1, 2024\n\nFor him, the SEC will have to be forced again by a court decision. Indeed, Bitcoin ETFs probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if the Columbia Court hadn\u2019t given the green light for Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust to be converted into an ETF.\n\nJake Chervinsky also added that it is reasonable to think that the question is not \u201cif\u201d Ethereum ETFs will become a reality, but \u201cwhen\u201d.\n\nEthereum has not been affected by the postponement of the SEC\u2019s decision. It is trading around $3,700, which is 30% below its 2021 record high.\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair is still down 34% compared to 2021. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a hair\u2019s breadth from its all-time high, bolstered by the tens of billions of dollars funneled through ETFs.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Taiko, a layer-2 scalability solution for the Ethereum blockchain, has just closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Lightspeed Faction, Wintermute Ventures, GSR, and other Venture Capital firms.\n\nThe money will be used to develop the emerging network, which will go live on mainnet in the coming months. Additionally, part of the funds raised could be dedicated to an incentive program through an airdrop, distributing the new native crypto of Taiko to all the first users of the chain.\n\nAll the details below.\n\nTaiko: Ethereum\u2019s layer 2 announces $15 million Series A funding round\n\nTaiko is a layer-2 cryptographic network, designed to improve the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis is a ZKEVM rollup that uses zero-knowledge computational proofs to batch transactions off-chain and later send the compressed data to Ethereum.\n\nThe project features a \u201cbased contestable rollup\u201d architecture in which there are mechanisms for contesting operations.\n\nWhile Taiko developers continue their work from 2022, the network is currently in testnet, to be precise within the sixth testing phase called Katia.\n\nWith the launch of the mainnet scheduled in the coming months, this type of layer-2 has already recorded excellent numbers with 1.1 million addresses created and 13 million transactions executed\n\nNow Taiko can rely on new resources ready to be invested in the development of the chain, after a Series A funding round of 15 million dollars has been closed.\n\nInvestors such as Lightspeed Faction, Hashed, Generative Ventures, and Token Bay Capital have invested in the secondary network of Ethereum, leading the round, along with other Venture Capital firms like Wintermute Ventures, Flow Traders, Amber Group, OKX Ventures, and GSR.\n\n9 months ago Taiko had revealed two more funding rounds, totaling 22 million dollars, which have been used in recent months to continue the development of the new network.\n\nWe're excited to announce that Taiko Labs, the core development team behind the Taiko protocol, has raised $37M in total capital across three rounds!\n\n\n\n1/ pic.twitter.com/1F6gD6l3Bh \u2014 Taiko \ud83e\udd41 (@taikoxyz) March 2, 2024\n\nIt is currently unclear whether the latest Series A funding announcement was concluded through an equity, token, or mixed structure for investors. What we do know is that in the future, with the same investors who are \u201cbetting\u201d on Taiko\u2019s growth, an investment fund in the crypto sector will be created.\n\nIn honor of the excellent result achieved, Terence Lam, the co-founder of the project, stated in his own words while layer 2 eagerly awaits to make its entrance into mainnet:\n\n\u201cWe definitely need to update our Katla testnet to enable support for EIP-4844 and perform an additional round of stress testing and security audit for the mainnet. The current outlook for completing all of this is before the end of the second quarter.\u201d\n\nThe Taiko team is composed of 40 people working on different tasks, with one front dedicated to engineering and the other on community growth and support of the cryptographic ecosystem.\n\nTaiko could launch a token through an airdrop after entering the mainnet\n\nWhile Ethereum Taiko\u2019s layer 2 completes the final network adjustments before entering mainnet, airdrop hunters are getting ready to seize another earning opportunity.\n\nThe need to launch a native token within its own ecosystem suggests that Taiko will take the opportunity to attract network traffic and new capital through an incentive system, riding the trend of airdrops on second-tier chains.\n\nWith Starknet officially launching its STRK resource just two weeks ago and distributing the token to its community, and with other major players on the horizon like ZkSync, Scroll, and Linea ready to follow the same path, market attention is becoming increasingly focused in this context.\n\nThe airdrop itself does not represent exclusively a way to decentralize one\u2019s cryptocurrency to a layer-2, but rather is seen as a marketing tool capable of attracting data and capital flows.\n\nFurthermore, this process allows to reward the same VCs who have financed the project (and who allow a token launch with attached liquidity) by offering their token as an exit, which is still subject to a vesting period to prevent it from being dumped on the market at listing.\n\nCurrently, to participate in the airdrop of this Ethereum scaling solution, you can only move in testnet, carrying out social campaigns on Galxe, becoming active members on Discord and offering support on Github commits.\n\nTaiko just announced their $15M funding round.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0Total raise till now: $37M\n\n\n\nAccording to their latest announcement, six testnets were conducted involving 1.1M unique wallets.\n\n\n\nAs of now the 6th testnet \"Katla\" is live.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udde7 You can try out their Galxe campaign if you want to\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ASFr5zeu1G \u2014 Airdrop Official \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a (@its_airdrop) March 2, 2024\n\nHowever, the most important phase to farm the Taiko airdrop is yet to come: the launch of the mainnet in this sense represents a more concrete opportunity to qualify for the coin distribution.\n\nMany of these layer-2 solutions that aim to launch a token with this kind of initiative, in fact, try to stimulate as much network traffic as possible on the main network, where the project collects fees.\n\nSo, as in the cases of similar projects, even for Taiko the eligibility for the airdrop will likely be guaranteed by actions such as bridging funds on the chain, executing transactions over different months, interacting with a wide range of protocols, and generating a good volume of exchanges."

Yet, based on both technical and sentiment analysis, a correction in the short term is looking probable.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been blowing past several resistance levels since rebounding from the $2,200 level at the beginning of February. The market is currently testing the $3,500 resistance level and is yet to break to the upside definitively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Relative Strength Index demonstrates a clear overbought signal pointing to a potential consolidation or pullback in the coming days. In this case, the $3,000 level can provide sufficient support to prevent a deeper drop.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nLooking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price has recently demonstrated signs of weakness, failing to break above the $3,500 level.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index also demonstrates a bearish divergence between the two recent highs. As a result, another rejection from the $3,500 level might occur, leading to a correction toward the $3,000 zone.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nEthereum Open Interest\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has been rallying rapidly over the last few weeks, approaching the $4,000 mark. This has led many speculators to jump on the crypto wagon once more and chase substantial profits.\n\nThis chart represents the open interest, which is a useful metric for futures market sentiment evaluation. It measures the number of open perpetual futures contracts across all crypto exchanges.\n\nThe open interest has also been experiencing a steep rise during the recent bullish run. While we have already concluded that there is a logical reason for this trend, high open interest values tend to result in increased volatility."

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Hand Over Fist in March - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With the crypto market starting to heat up, these three have plenty of room to run.\n\nIn case you haven't heard, crypto is back. Continuing its impressive 2023 run, crypto hasn't missed a beat in 2024 and the crypto market has collectively jumped by 35% to start off the new year. By most accounts, this upcoming year could be one of those historical periods when many cryptocurrencies soar to new all-time highs and records are broken as the asset class finds its digital footing in the world of finance.\n\nFor investors looking to ride the waves of momentum that can produce monumental crypto gains, here are three cryptocurrencies to add to your wish list for March.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nWe can't talk about crypto without mentioning Bitcoin (BTC 0.31%). It is not only the world's first cryptocurrency, but also the most valuable. In fact, it accounts for more than half of the value in the entire class of digital assets.\n\nThanks to a recent jump, Bitcoin's total market cap surpassed $1.3 trillion. At the time of publishing, the leading crypto stands a mere 1% shy of its previous all-time high of around $68,800. Even though it's within striking distance of previous records, the cryptocurrency should still be on investors' radar. Many indicators and data points suggest that the crypto bull market has yet to hit a peak, meaning Bitcoin is in a position to notch a new all-time high.\n\nFurthermore, since Bitcoin makes up the overwhelming majority of value in crypto, it offers investors a simple and straightforward strategy to gain exposure to the best quality the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. Rather than combing through the thousands of altcoins that typically trade in a correlated fashion to Bitcoin, investors can save themselves the hassle by just sticking with the original name in this explosive market.\n\n2. Ethereum\n\nThe second to make the list of cryptocurrencies to buy in March is Ethereum (ETH -0.20%). When it launched in 2015, Ethereum's smart contracts essentially made it the first programmable cryptocurrency. As a result, developers could build applications that have become commonplace in today's digital economy, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), auto-correcting stablecoins, and decentralized exchanges, just to name a few.\n\nWhile subsequent blockchains followed Ethereum with their own smart contract functionality, Ethereum's first-mover advantage has given it a considerable lead. Similar to how Bitcoin makes up the bulk of value in crypto, Ethereum constitutes the majority of value in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nAs of March 3, Ethereum's blockchain was home to more than 60% of the total value in DeFi. The next closest is Tron, an upstart with just 10%.\n\nBy owning Ethereum, investors gain exposure to one of the most popular and utilized blockchains in the world. While there are some hopeful competitors looking to unseat Ethereum as the leading DeFi blockchain, these attempts look futile so far.\n\n3. Solana\n\nOut of those hopeful competitors looking to challenge Ethereum is Solana (SOL -0.09%) -- and it's making a good run. While there is still considerable difference separating the two, Solana has risen to become what could be argued to be the most likely candidate to pull off this feat.\n\nThe allure of Solana compared to Ethereum is its blazing speeds and low fees, and this has led to a surge in interest from users looking for more economical options. After seeing its price fall by more than 90% in the crypto winter of 2022, Solana has seen its price soar as its blockchain has exploded with activity.\n\nSeveral key metrics, such as active addresses, new addresses, transactions, and total fees, are at multiyear highs. Most importantly, though, as Solana's network is booming, its price still remains roughly 50% off of its all-time high. Should momentum in the crypto bull market continue, it should be more than enough for Solana to climb back toward its record levels and likely surpass them."

        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs surpassed Ethereum on the weekly volume charts, with the NodeMonkes collection leading the charts as its market cap exceeded $500 million.\n\nOf the top five collections by weekly sales, three were from the Bitcoin ecosystem as interest in Ordinals surges as BTC approaches its all-time high in the ongoing bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin just can\u2019t put a foot wrong this year. The top crypto has gained close to 60% since the turn of the year, and it\u2019s edging ever closer to breaking its record-high price, as this report by Crypto News Flash alludes to. This terrific start to the year has translated to its NFTs, with Ordinals outshining Ethereum NFTs to emerge as the most traded weekly.\n\nAccording to data from Crypto Slam, Bitcoin NFTs have attracted $181,821,799 in trading volume, just edging out Ethereum to rank highest in the market. Ethereum trails closely behind by around $650,000, with Solana at a distant third with $65 million.\n\nWhile Bitcoin just edges Ethereum out, the altcoin still has superior numbers on the all-time list at $42 billion to $2.6 billion, and on the buyer\u2019s charts, its numbers are at least eight times higher.\n\nOn the weekly chart, Bitcoin saw 58,829 buyers, while Ethereum saw nearly twice that at 110,642.\n\nMost interestingly, the highest volume of trade went to uncategorized Ordinals, which Crypto Slam describes as \u201ca diverse assortment of digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain that has not yet been identified as part of an established collection.\u201d\n\nThis points to Bitcoin\u2019s NFT revolution being spearheaded by retail users who mint their own Ordinals rather than purchasing from the blue-collar NFT collections. This is massively bullish as it shows genuine interest in the BTC NFTs and indicates that this hype can be sustained.\n\nNodeMonkes came in second on the weekly volume charts and was the top collection. NodeMonkes boasts of being the first collection to inscribe 10,000 unique pixelated profile pictures on the Bitcoin blockchain in the first few weeks after Ordinals launched. However, the collection\u2019s release was delayed, and others went to the market first.\n\nNodeMonkes have become wildly popular, and on Monday, one NFT in the collection sold for over $1 million for the first. The NFT, known as Alien Hoodie, is the second-highest NFT sale on Bitcoin after the recent $1.4 million sale of the second-ever Bitcoin Ordinal inscription.\n\nSOLD: Alien Hoodie (#2769) for 17 btc ($1,080,000) on M.E. The first million dollar monke sale. Congratulations to buyer & seller. \u2014\u2014 SEND NODES \u2014\u2014 pic.twitter.com/9DrvZBJH2X \u2014 NodeMonkes \u25c9 (@nodemonkes) March 4, 2024\n\nThe NATCATS TAP collection rounds up the top five highest sales this week as Bitcoin\u2019s third entry. Ethereum\u2019s entries into the top five were CryptoPunks and Pandora.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Flip Ethereum NFTs\n\nFor Bitcoin, flipping Ethereum is monumental. The king of altcoins has dominated the NFTs market for years, emerging as the most favored network for some of the largest collections, from Bored Ape Yacht Club to CryptoPunks and ArtBlocks.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum has been at it for over five years. On the other hand, Bitcoin has barely done it for a year, with its Ordinals NFTs launching early last year. However, in that time, BTC has recorded $265 billion in overall trading volume with 370,000 buyers.\n\nEthereum might have even bigger challenges to worry about on the NFT front. As Crypto News Flash reported, the Injective network recently released its version of the semi-fungible ERC-404 token standard, giving Ethereum a run for its money on the front.\n\nCloser to home, users are increasingly turning to Layer 2 solutions to mint their NFTs to avoid gas charges on Ethereum. While this is still technically part of the Ethereum ecosystem, it points to dissatisfaction in the network. Crypto News Flash pointed to this trend in December when it reported on the rise of Polygon NFTs.\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

The upswing in price is attributed to growing mainstream adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the approaching Bitcoin Halving event. BTC is eyeing towards $67,150 resistance level, if the momentum continues, a close above it this week could signal the potential for a new all-time high,\" said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.Meanwhile, Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to break the $3,600 level, which could potentially push the second-largest cryptocurrency beyond $4,000.\"The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $110.12B, which makes a 28.38% increase. The total volume in DeFi is currently $9.6 billion, 8.71% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $129.27 billion, which is 88.33% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to $1.244 trillion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.36%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 65.6% to $34.75 billion.\"In the past 24 hours, around $59.27 million worth of Bitcoin positions, with $38.52 million in shorts, were liquidated. This surge is linked to the growing mainstream adoption, notably propelled by the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, cultivating a stronger holding mentality among investors,\" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President at WazirX.Bitcoin's recent surge to over $62,000 has captivated crypto enthusiasts and surprised sceptics alike, marking a period of exponential growth. The rally witnessed in February even set a record, representing the longest monthly green candle in Bitcoin's history. Despite this remarkable rise, several key factors and upcoming events suggest that this may just be the beginning of a significant bull run with further potential gains.Bitcoin after taking multiple support at $40,000 resumed the up move and rallied up to $52,985. The asset was facing stiff resistance at $52,000 and started consolidating between $52,000 and $50,000. Post this move, BTC finally gave a breakout above the range and surged up to $6,248. The asset has a strong resistance at $64,000 and $69,000 and to further rally it needs to break, close and sustain above these levels. $52,000 and $56,000 will act as a strong support for the asset."

IntoTheBlock reports that 97% of all Bitcoin addresses are currently profitable, marking a milestone unseen in over two years. The upswing in price is credited to the growing mainstream adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event. Bulls are currently active in the market and are eyeing $67,150\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cWith the overall crypto market rising, global crypto M.Cap continues to pick up; crossing the $2.5 trillion level for the first time since December 2021. Simultaneously, with weekly gains of over 23%, BTC (+2.7% in the last 24 hours) is currently trading at over $63.5K; ETH (+1.4%) is trading at over $3.4K. Data shows that BTC withdrawals from exchanges are happening at a rapid pace, indicating rising investor activity. This could be a signal of a bullish future, given that BTC\u2019s prices are maintained and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index continues to stay in the \u2018Extreme Greed\u2019 region with a score of 82/100.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin soared above $64,000 on Monday, nearing its all-time high from November 2021. Over the past 24 hours, $59.27 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated, with $38.52 million in shorts. The surge is linked to growing mainstream adoption, notably through Spot Bitcoin ETFs, fostering a stronger holding mentality. Long-term Bitcoin holders have reaped the most significant profits in this new wave of enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's price at $62,000 sees a slight dip of 0.10% amid regulatory shifts and market movements. The UK's expanded seizure powers under the Economic Crime Act may bolster investor confidence, while Marathon Digital's Anduro platform aims to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities, potentially impacting its value. Nigeria's clarification on Binance fines underscores regulatory uncertainties. Despite challenges, Bitcoin remains bullish above $60,750, supported by technical indicators. Green Bitcoin introduces Gamified Green Staking, promoting eco-consciousness and offering rewards, shaping a sustainable financial landscape.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"Bitcoin surged above $64,000 again, being only 10% away from its ATH ($69,000). Bitcoin's market capitalization currently stands at $1.25 trillion with market dominance at 52.23%, after seeing an increase of 0.54% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to break the $3,600 level, which could potentially push the second-largest cryptocurrency beyond $4,000.\"\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "title": "Crypto Whales Splash Into Pullix (PLX) ICO After BitMart Listing, Will The TradFi Powerhouse Continue To Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) And Ethereum (ETH) - Tekedia",
        "content": "Crypto whales have seen significant returns following the recent upswing in value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Both of these cryptocurrencies experienced an exponential level of growth on the weekly and monthly charts, and at this rate could surge even further up. Yet, the same whales accumulated the Pullix (PLX) cryptocurrency during its blockchain ICO.\n\nThe crypto has already grown 250%, and could soon spike 100x following its BitMart listing. We will go over all three to determine which one can surge the most in value, and see why PLX is the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Performance Bullish \u2013 Surges Above $62,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has gained a lot of attention as of recently based on its optimal price performance. Just during the previous week, the Bitcoin crypto experienced a notable price upswing, in anticipation for the Bitcoin halving.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin today has high growth potential, especially as it surged 20.3% in the past week, and 44% in the past month. Its value spiked up from $50,607.53 to a maximum value of $63,938.71 during the past seven days, and according to the Bitcoin price prediction, the highest level it can reach in 2024 is at $100,903.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Nears $4,000 Price Point After Jump Above $3,000\n\nEthereum (ETH) also showcased dominant on-chart performance. The Ethereum value has seen a notable upswing in the past week, where it moved above the $3,400 level. Moreover, the current Ethereum price has not finished climbing, as it has reached a 50% increase in the past 30- days, and a YTD upswing of 113%. Based on the Ethereum price prediction, it can reach $5,534 by the end of 2024.\n\nPullix (PLX) Accumulated by Crypto Whales After BitMart Listing Announcement\n\nPullix (PLX) is an upcoming project that can dominate the Web3 space as it will introduce a hybrid platform in which anyone can get access to the best elements of CEXs and DEXs in a streamlined experience. Anyone can access it without the need to undergo KYC procedures. Users can get leverage, up to 1000:1, and the platform will even introduce a token burn feature, where the supply will decrease over time and increase the PLX token scarcity. Moreover, anyone can also stake their crypto into automated market makers (AMMs) to get additional value.\n\nThe cryptocurrency recently sold out its presale in rapid time, raising nearly $10 million. Over 20,000 participants registered for the presale, and following its BitMart listing, it can spike as high as 100x, which has attracted massive whale attention. These aspects make PLX the best new crypto to invest in.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile whales did initially accumulate Bitcoin and Ethereum, and those two major cryptocurrencies still have growth potential, it\u2019s clear that the most significant gains can be made with Pullix. With its BitMart listing, it will become available to a much broader range of traders and investors, and at this rate, could reach new heights, and it\u2019s one of the best cryptos to buy now.\n\nFor more information regarding Pullix, see links below:\n\nVisit Pullix\n\nJoin The Pullix Community\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nThe upcoming Ethereum upgrade, called Dencun , is eagerly anticipated by the community.\n\n, is eagerly anticipated by the community. ETH staked on the Beacon Chain has experienced a significant increase, reaching a total of 31.387 million ETH, valued at approximately $116 billion.\n\nDencun promises to improve transaction speed and profitability on the network, addressing concerns about scalability and efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe crypto community eagerly awaits the upcoming Ethereum upgrade, known as Dencun. With just a week to go, data shows a significant increase in the amount of Ethereum staked on the Beacon Chain, reaching an impressive total of 31.387 million ETH, valued at approximately $116 billion.\n\nThis increase in staked ETH reflects an upward trend since the beginning of the year, with a 9% growth. This steady increase underscores the ongoing interest and confidence in the Ethereum platform and its shift towards a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, implemented in September 2022 with \u201cThe Merge.\u201d\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has been primarily highlighted by the introduction of proto-danksharding, a feature that promises to make transactions on the network faster and more profitable. This improvement is especially relevant at a time when scalability and efficiency are critical issues for widespread cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nIn addition to improvements in transaction speed and efficiency, the Dencun upgrade also brings significant changes to the Ethereum staking process. One of the most notable changes is the introduction of EIP-7044, which aims to make it easier for users to earn rewards through Ethereum staking without the need to be full validators. This improvement will also simplify the process of unstaking ETH, offering a smoother and more accessible experience for users.\n\nEthereum Prepares to Take a Key Step Towards a Bright Future\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of EIP-7044 is its ability to allow ETH validators and stakers to store exit instructions in smart contracts. This provides an additional layer of security and flexibility, allowing users to specify conditions under which they want to withdraw their Ethereum. For example, users could set conditions to automatically withdraw if their hardware remains inactive for an extended period, helping to protect validators against potential penalties for failing to process transactions on time.\n\nDencun promises to significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and accessibility of the network. With a steady increase in the amount of ETH staked and exciting improvements on the horizon, the future of Ethereum looks brighter than ever."

        "title": "Ethereum Could Hit $4,000 with Break of Key Resistance, Glassnode Co-founders Say - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is witnessing an intriguing development as Ethereum (ETH) is on the brink of potentially breaking a significant price resistance. According to the latest market analysis shared by the co-founders of Glassnode, a leading blockchain analytics firm, Ethereum is showing promising signs of a bullish run that could see its value surge towards the $4,000 mark.\n\nThrough a detailed tweet from Negentropic, an X (formerly Twitter) account run by Glassnode\u2019s co-founders, the recent market dynamics were dissected. The post outlined Ethereum\u2019s market behavior, noting its recent price actions mirroring those of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nLast week, #ETH mirrored #BTC\u2019s rise but struggled around $3.5k-$3.6k. Meanwhile, #BTC soared past $60k, touching $64k before settling near $62k. Failure to break $3.5k may lead to sideways movement, but a close above could fuel a surge towards $4k and beyond! \ud83d\ude80 #crypto \u2014 \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0 (@Negentropic_) March 5, 2024\n\nHowever, while Bitcoin has experienced a substantial rally, surpassing the $60,000 threshold and reaching highs of $64,000 before stabilizing around $62,000, Ethereum has faced hurdles. The analysis indicated that ETH has struggled to breach the resistance zone between $3,500 and $3,600.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum is currently witnessing a positive shift in momentum. The latest figures show ETH\u2019s price standing at $3,759, representing a 7.40% increase over the last 24 hours. Moreover, there has been a significant uptick in trading volume, with a 76.40% increase, signaling heightened activity and interest in the cryptocurrency, with current volumes reaching $32.1 billion.\n\nBullish Catalysts for Ethereum\n\nThe optimistic sentiment surrounding Ethereum is underpinned by various factors that suggest a favorable market outlook. Key among these is the growing adoption and utility of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which continue to thrive on the Ethereum platform. This burgeoning sector has introduced a new paradigm in financial services, contributing to Ethereum\u2019s increased demand and valuation.\n\nAdditionally, the upcoming Dencun upgrade for Ethereum, set for March 13th, 2024, marks a significant advancement and may enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability, allowing it to better contend with quicker Smart Contract Platforms in the cryptocurrency sector, like Solana (SOL). This upgrade is expected to address existing bottlenecks and enhance the overall functionality of the Ethereum network, making it more appealing for broader applications and investments.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize the inherent volatility and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency market. While Ethereum\u2019s prospects appear robust, its future price movements will be influenced by a myriad of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Investors and enthusiasts are therefore encouraged to stay informed and approach their investment decisions with caution and due diligence.\n\nOverall, the path ahead remains filled with uncertainties. As the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, Ethereum\u2019s journey toward the $4,000 mark will be closely monitored by investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike, marking yet another exciting chapter in the ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrency."
