This is where Base by Coinbase comes in. Base is a new Ethereum-based crypto platform that increases transaction speed and security and supports a variety of applications.\n\nHere\u2019s what Base is, how it works, its benefits and potential drawbacks and its use cases.\n\nWhat is Base by Coinbase?\n\nBase by Coinbase is a crypto platform that uses the Ethereum network to increase transaction speed, security and accessibility while reducing costs. Unlike other cryptocurrency platforms, Base is specifically designed using blockchain to support decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBase uses what\u2019s known as Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain. The Layer 2 blockchain is designed to perform transaction-heavy work with speed, keeping costs lower for the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1). Base uses OP Stack, an open-source development platform, to create greater compatibility and ease of transition for developers familiar with Ethereum.\n\nBecause of this approach, Base can offer low transaction fees, faster transaction times and full compatibility with Ethereum processes. Base is linked with Coinbase, making it accessible for broader adoption in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow does Base work and what is it used for?\n\nBuilt as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network, Base is designed to increase performance, interoperability and scalability while decreasing transaction costs and settlement time.\n\nBase processes transactions off-chain through a mechanism known as \u201crollups,\u201d bundling multiple transactions together and submitting them as a single batch to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 for validation. This approach reduces costs and load on the main Ethereum network.\n\nThe primary use cases for Base include the following:\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) platforms\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces\n\nGaming and virtual worlds\n\nSocial media platforms\n\nSupply chain and logistics applications\n\nBase\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum-based tools and frameworks, along with lower fees and faster transaction times, make it a useful platform for developers and individuals.\n\nThe benefits of Base by Coinbase\n\nBase by Coinbase offers some key advantages for individuals and businesses:\n\nFaster transactions: Base processes transactions quicker than the main Ethereum network, making it more efficient and user-friendly, especially during peak network activity.\n\nBase processes transactions quicker than the main Ethereum network, making it more efficient and user-friendly, especially during peak network activity.

Accessibility: Base is linked with Coinbase, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, so it\u2019s easily accessible to a broad audience in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe potential drawbacks of Base\n\nWhile Base by Coinbase is a powerful tool, it\u2019s equally important to consider its potential limitations and challenges:\n\nComplexity: Layer 2 solutions such as Base can introduce complexity that may be daunting for newcomers to blockchain technology. This complexity could slow user adoption and create hurdles in understanding its functionality.\n\nLayer 2 solutions such as Base can introduce complexity that may be daunting for newcomers to blockchain technology.

Scalability concerns: Despite its robust infrastructure, Base has had transaction failures and increased gas fees during periods of high use. So it may need further scalability to manage significant user growth in the future.\n\nDespite its robust infrastructure, Base has had transaction failures and increased gas fees during periods of high use. So it may need further scalability to manage significant user growth in the future. User experience: The transition from traditional Ethereum transactions to Base might not be seamless for all users, leading to potential difficulties.\n\nCan you buy Base from Coinbase?\n\nCoinbase says it does not currently plan to issue a new network token for Base. Instead, Base will use Ethereum as its native gas token. So at least for now there is no Base crypto coin to buy.\n\nCoinbase warns that users should be aware that scammers may try to send fake Base tokens and suggests that you don\u2019t interact with anyone peddling fake Base coins.\n\nBottom line\n\nBase by Coinbase is a Layer 2 solution for the Ethereum network, offering faster transaction times, lower fees and increased compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite some key advantages, users should pay attention to potential drawbacks such as security and complexity."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming full approval of a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be a significant milestone in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. This development not only impacts ethereum but also broadens the horizon for the entire crypto industry. Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson and David Uhryniak, Director of Ecosystem Development at TRON DAO, weigh in on the implications of this event.\n\nAccording to Nelson, the approval is not just a win for ethereum but a sign of increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. He emphasized that while bitcoin might experience a temporary setback, the overall trend is positive for the entire crypto space.\n\nTRON DAO's David Uhryniak noted that the approval represents a crucial step towards wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. He believes that as more people become comfortable discussing and investing in digital currencies like ethereum and bitcoin, they will begin to see the practical applications of these technologies in their everyday lives.\n\nThis growing familiarity with cryptocurrencies could lead to greater integration of blockchain technology in various sectors, he said. Uhryniak envisions a future where owning a piece of ethereum or bitcoin prompts individuals to explore how these assets are used, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding and broader application in workplaces and beyond."

        "title": "Lido Takes Initial Step to Decentralize Ethereum Node Operator Set Amid SEC Allegations - Unchained",
        "content": "Monday saw the debut of Lido\u2019s Community Staking Module on the Holesky test network, which aims to allow new entities, including solo stakers, to become node operators without needing permission from its DAO.\n\nLido jumpstarted the liquid staking ecosystem in 2020 by introducing its flagship product, stETH, a rebasing token representing a person\u2019s principal amount of staked ETH and their rewards from helping secure the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nAs it faces allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, liquid staking leader Lido is preparing to become more decentralized by taking a step toward integrating a more diverse set of Ethereum node operators, such as solo stakers, the \u201cgold standard\u201d for staking, per the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nOn Monday, a Lido initiative called Community Staking Module, which is expected to allow permissionless entry for node operators, activated on the Holesky test network, according to a governance post in Lido\u2019s forums by Dmitry Gusakov, the tech leader of Lido\u2019s community staking product.\n\nThe move comes days after the SEC implied in a lawsuit against Ethereum software provider Consensys that Lido\u2019s liquid staking token, stETH, is an unregistered security. Staked ETH, aka stETH, represents a person\u2019s principal amount of staked ETH and their staking rewards from helping secure the Ethereum blockchain network.\n\nLido\u2019s stETH has a market cap of $33 billion, making the liquid staking provider the leading DeFi protocol by total value locked. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard by crypto analyst Hildobby, Lido commands a 29% share of the total 33.3 million staked ETH.\n\nThe advent of Lido\u2019s community staking module marks a change to the protocol that first introduced liquid staking in 2020, because Lido on Ethereum has had a curated and permissioned validator set since its inception, in which those interested in acting as a node operator for Lido had to be vetted by the Lido DAO.\n\nPermissioned and Restricted Since Inception\n\nUnlike its competitor Rocket Pool, before a node operator can conduct validator operations for Lido, governance has to vote on whether to include a prospective address into Lido\u2019s active set of node operators. At presstime, Lido has 39 node operators, which includes the likes of P2P.org, Chorus One, and Consensys.\n\nThe initiative centered on permissionless entry allows \u201cany node operator \u2013 and especially community stakers, from solo stakers, to groups of friends, to amateur operators \u2013 to operate validators by providing an ETH-based bond (security collateral),\u201d according to its documentation.\n\nThe new community module is expected to make solo staking more accessible through its inclusion of several features such as a low bond for node operators as well as smoothed rewards from Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and maximum extractable value.\n\nLido becomes less centralized by making its node operator set permissionless. During the lifecycle of a crypto project, a protocol will typically start with heavy elements of centralization, ranging from core developers holding control over the direction of the project, sometimes in the form of fundraising to delaying a protocol\u2019s token generation event that aims to introduce governance mechanisms for those in the community.\n\nEventually, founders and core members of a protocol would introduce decentralization initiatives, such as implementing onchain voting processes or making node operation permissionless such as the case with Lido.\n\nSEC\u2019s Focus on Consensys and Lido\n\nAlthough, like most DeFi projects, Lido has had a roadmap to decentralization for a while, the initiative comes several days after the SEC charged Consensys for offering and selling unregistered securities, namely Lido and Rocket Pool\u2019s liquid staking tokens, through Metamask, a crypto wallet where people can stake and swap cryptocurrencies.\n\nConsensys, which is also a node operator for Lido, \u201chas offered and sold tens of thousands of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking program providers Lido and Rocket Pool, who created and issue liquid staking tokens (called stETH and rETH) in exchange for staked assets,\u201d the SEC\u2019s press release states.\n\nRead More: Could the SEC Have a Case Against Liquid Staking Protocols?\n\nThe complaint calls Lido and Rocket Pool issuers of unregistered securities, alleging that their staking programs \u201care each offered and sold as investment contracts and, therefore, securities.\u201d\n\nFollowing the prongs of the so-called Howey test, which, since a 1946 court case, has been the legal measure to determine whether an investment is a securities offering, the agency said these liquid staking tokens meet the criteria.\n\nIn its press release it said, the buyers of LSTs \u201cmake an investment of ETH in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits from the managerial efforts of Lido and Rocket Pool, respectively.\u201d However, neither Lido nor Rocket Pool has filed registrations to offer these securities with the SEC.\n\nWith the fourth prong of the Howey test being \u201cthe managerial efforts of others,\u201d crypto projects have sought to be decentralized enough that such a third party could not be easily named.\n\nWhen Unchained reached out to the founders and key members of Lido in May for commentary on whether the SEC took action against the liquid staking provider or contacted them about stETH, Unchained did not receive a response. According to a snapshot vote taken in Aug. 2022, Eric Hill, who goes by @Rotorless on X, is Lido\u2019s head of legal and general counsel. However, when Unchained contacted Hill for commentary, he said he did not hold that position anymore and wasn\u2019t \u201cthe right person to talk to.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Consensys, when Unchained highlighted SEC\u2019s claims that stETH is an unregistered security, Lido marketing lead Kasper Rasmussen said, \u201cWe\u2019re on it,\u201d but did not provide additional insights.\n\nLDO, the governance token for Lido, has decreased 6.3% in the past 24 hours and 19.7% over the last 30 days to trade at $1.92, making its market cap stand at $1.7 billion, per CoinGecko.\n\nUPDATE (July 3, 2024, 3:08 p.m. ET): Added clarification on the timeline for Lido\u2019s plan to make the process to become a node validator permissionless, as well as the way Lido founders and key members responded to queries about regulatory issues when Unchained reached out to them in May."

This market relies heavily on Ether as a liquid asset and an economic vehicle.\n\nHowever, ETFs hold assets and wait for higher prices, which could lead to large amounts of dormant Ether. The issue is further exacerbated by the absence of staking activity in proposed spot ETH funds. Flipside Crypto data scientist Carlos Mercado said it\u2019s not the best use case for Ether, but Wooding insists the outcome may be a net positive for ETH proponents.\n\nPer Wooding, reduced liquidity and dormant ETH could incentivize more directly Ether staking, resulting in higher on-chain yield as spot ETFs capture significant supply.\n\n\u201cWhile dormant ETH from ETFs might reduce DeFi liquidity, the broader market exposure and increased participation could eventually drive more direct engagement in staking and DeFi, balancing out the initial impact\u200b,\u201d Wooding discussed with crypto.news via email.\n\nWhen will we see spot Ethereum ETF?\n\nAfter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued initial approval for spot ETH ETFs last month, issuers and experts expect final greenlights to arrive before the end of Q3 2024. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggested the regulatory nod could occur this month, and SEC chair Gary Gensler told Congress to expect an outcome by the end of summer.\n\nAlthough speculation exists that the SEC could spurn issuers, especially after the agency sued Consenys over its MetaMask wallet and staking offerings, Wooding is confident the regulator will approve spot ETH ETFs this month.\n\nPer Wooding, rejecting Ethereum funds could dampen the SEC\u2019s credibility and competency. SCRYPT\u2019s CEO added that a denial might also prompt further regulatory discussions and result in better, refined future proposals.\n\nFurthermore, Ether prices may slide downward if the SEC denies spot Ether ETFs. However, Woodings surmised that such an outcome is unlikely and a market downswing would be short-lived in any case. \u201cThe fundamental value and utility of Ethereum remain strong, and the market would likely stabilize as investors refocus on its technological developments and applications.\u201d per Wooding."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAsset manager Bitwise submitted an updated registration statement for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF with regulators on Wednesday, disclosing its plans to waive fees. While largely procedural, this latest revision is seen by market observers as a sign that the launch of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\n\u201cExpect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter (aka X). \u201cWe're thinking these things could potentially [be listed] later next week, or the week of the 15th at this point.\u201d\n\nAfter shares in the Bitwise Ethereum ETF are listed on an exchange, Bitwise will waive a yet-to-be-defined management fee on the first $500 million its fund garners during that period, the amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated.\n\nBitwise\u2019s move follows similar ones from Franklin Templeton and VanEck. Both ETF hopefuls have included fee waivers in filings for the first $10 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnticipation of the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs has grown steadily since the regulator\u2019s last-minute approval in May. While the SEC approved several so-called form 19b-4s, it has yet to green light individual S-1 filings from asset managers, which are needed for trading to begin.\n\nBitwise submitted its amended S-1 days before it was actually due, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On Twitter, he floated the idea that Bitwise \u201cwanted to get it off their plate,\u201d and that the SEC\u2019s latest round of comments appeared to be minimal.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear the last round of comments were \u2018literally nothing\u2019\u2014took zero time to update,\u201d he said.\n\nBalchunas concurred that the class of products seems on track to begin trading this month. At the same time, he wondered why the regulator appears to be dragging its feet, considering the SEC seems mostly satisfied with the filings that firms have put forward so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven how light comments were, these could have easily been trading by now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCould be one 'problem' issuer slowing down [the] process or just summertime.\u201d\n\nNot long after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved on May 23, the cryptocurrency rallied to around $4,000. Yet as the approval process has played out, Ethereum\u2019s price has shed most of those gains, drifting down $3,270, as of this writing.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler said last month that the process for launching spot Ethereum ETFs is \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest Summit, he added that progress is dependent on asset managers providing full disclosures.\n\nThough Bitwise\u2019s amended filing has few changes, it does include new disclosure language. For example, a clause was inserted stating the \u201cchair of the SEC has stated that the SEC has authority under existing laws to regulate the digital asset sector\u201d within a section on oversight.\n\nBitwise also added a few sentences disclosing that certain digital asset trading platforms, to the extent that they are regulated, may not be in compliance with applicable rules.\n\nFinally, a section also outlines the \u201cInitial Creation of Ether.\u201d Looking at Ethereum\u2019s initial supply of 72 million, it shows how most was sold to the public through a crowd sale in 2014, alongside distributions to the Ethereum Foundation and the network's developers.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethere\u00adum (ETH) is generating considerable\u00ad excitement as the\u00ad U.S. edges closer to approving spot ETFs. Analysts pre\u00addict substantial capital inflows into these ETFs, potentially driving ETH price\u00ads higher. This optimism is bolstered by re\u00adcent technical analyses pointing to a bullish tre\u00adnd for Ethereum.\n\nRenowne\u00add analyst Ali Martinez recently e\u00adxamined Ethereum\u2019s 3-day chart, re\u00advealing insightful data. Martinez highlighted the\u00ad TD Sequential indicator, known for pinpointing market turning points, which flashe\u00add a buy signal for Ethereum. This signal suggests a possible\u00ad rebound for ETH, indicating a short-term bullish outlook.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 5\n\nThe TD Se\u00adquential indicator is respecte\u00add for identifying trend exhaustion points. A marke\u00add 9 buy signal typically precedes price\u00ad recovery or trend re\u00adversal. Martinez interpre\u00adts this signal as a precursor to a rebound following a period of downward price\u00ad movements. Historically, such signals have be\u00aden followed by a consolidation or a reve\u00adrsal.\n\nMartinez\u2019s analysis indicates that Ethere\u00adum might see a corrective\u00ad upward move. The rece\u00adnt price action shows Ethereum trading downward, with occasional upward spike\u00ads. The \u20189\u2019 buy signal suggests a potential pause\u00ad in the bearish trend, possibly le\u00adading to a brief rally. This aligns with historical behaviors observe\u00add after such signals.\n\nBullish Breakout Suggests Ethereum Price Surge\n\nAnother notable\u00ad analyst, ZAYK Charts, presents a bullish scenario for Ethe\u00adreum. ZAYK identified a falling we\u00addge on the ETH/USDT 12-hour chart. This bullish pattern ofte\u00adn reverse downtrend, sugge\u00adsting a potential upward breakout. The chart illustrate\u00ads ETH consolidating within converging trend lines ove\u00adr the past months.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 6\n\nZAYK\u2019s analysis shows that the breakout from the\u00ad falling wedge is complete\u00ad, indicating a shift in market sentiment. This te\u00adchnical pattern\u2019s confirmation suggests a bullish wave, with 20-30% price\u00ad increase projections. Following this bre\u00adakout, Ethereum\u2019s target price\u00ad range is optimistic and promising.\n\nCurrently, ETH is trading at $3,484.66, showing a 3.38% increase\u00ad and a 53.58% rise in trading volume within a day. This positive price\u00ad action indicates potential further upside\u00ads. The price is encounte\u00adring resistance around the $3,500 mark, with significant barrie\u00adrs at the $3,520 and $3,550 levels. A close\u00ad above $3,550 could propel Ether towards the\u00ad $3,650 resistance.\n\nEthereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts 7\n\nFurther re\u00adsistance is near $3,720, and an upside bre\u00adak above this level could drive\u00ad the price higher, pote\u00adntially reaching $3,880. However, a downside correction might start if Ethe\u00adreum fails to clear the $3,550 re\u00adsistance. Initial support is ne\u00adar $3,480, with significant support at the $3,440 zone.\n\nA move be\u00adlow the $3,420 support might push the price towards $3,350. Furthe\u00adr losses could decrease\u00ad the price to $3,320 in the short te\u00adrm. Overall, technical indicators and market se\u00adntiment suggest Ethere\u00adum is poised for a potential price surge\u00ad, supported by expecte\u00add ETF approvals and bullish technical patterns.\n\nRelated Readings | Solana (SOL) Faces 16% Value Drop, Yet Bullish Predictions Drive Hope Amidst Decline"

Gox\u2019s repayments to creditors, and governments selling seized Bitcoin on the open market \u2014 by piling into bullish Ether option trades.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 4.3% over the past 24 Horus to trade at $60,169.\n\nEthereum is down 4.3% to $3,300.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) whales appear to be igniting a potential sell-off today, as nearly $70 million worth of the cryptocurrency was transferred to Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This movement has sparked concerns among ETH traders about a possible market downturn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported two big transactions early this morning. The first tweet revealed that 9,999 ETH, worth around $34.3 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance. Shortly thereafter, Whale Alert tweeted again to disclose that another 7,413 ETH, worth around $25.4 million, were transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance.\n\nThese transactions amount to a total of 17,412 ETH, equivalent to approximately $69.86 million at current market prices. Such large transfers to an exchange typically signal an impending sell-off, as whales \u2014 large holders of cryptocurrency \u2014 often move their assets to exchanges when they intend to sell.\n\nBroader market impact\n\nThe news of these substantial transfers has already had a palpable effect on the market. Ethereum\u2019s price has shown increased volatility following the alerts, with traders closely monitoring Binance for any signs of large-scale selling activity. The potential sell-off by these whales could exert downward pressure on the ETH price, impacting the broader market as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorically, significant movements by whale accounts have led to notable price fluctuations. When large amounts of cryptocurrency are sold off, it can trigger a domino effect, causing other traders to panic and sell their holdings, further driving down the price.\n\nAs of writing this article, the Ethereum price is $3,447.60. It has fallen 0.30% in the last 24 hours. However, the ETH price is down 8.94% over the past 30 days thanks to the ongoing bearish phase on the broader market. While the ultimate impact on Ethereum\u2019s price remains to be seen, the movement of such large amounts of ETH to an exchange is a signal that cannot be ignored."

        "title": "Ethereum: Its History and Future Outlook - Camarillo Acorn",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world computer, has been instrumental in the blockchain and the cryptocurrency community since its entrance. Being one of the largest platforms for the implementation of smart contracts and dApps, Ethereum has become a platform for many new ideas in the digital economy niche. Appreciating its history from when it was born up to the present and its possibilities is useful in comprehending its importance and possibilities. Also, certain points in Ethereum\u2019s timeline can be marked as important, for example, the Ethereum price all time high and the lowest price Ethereum has hit in 2024.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nEthereum was introduced in late 2013 by a young programmer, Vitalik Buterin. Buterin planned on building a platform surpassing what Bitcoin can offer, a decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and dApps. This vision aimed at using blockchain technology not only to de-centralize money but also a number of applications and operations.\n\nThe development of Ethereum was backed by an ICO in 2014, the project creators accepted over 18 million dollars in Bitcoins. This funding effort was a testimony to the fact that the people believed in Buterin\u2019s vision. The Ethereum network officially went live on July 30, 2015, with the first block known as the \u201cFrontier.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Evolution and Milestones\n\n1. Early Growth and Adoption: The early years of Ethereum though were quite dynamic and experienced high adoption rates. Due to the ability of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, developers began to actively engage in developing dApps. Many initiatives, starting from decentralized finance (DeFi) and ending with gaming, appeared during this period and were based on Ethereum.\n\n2. The DAO and Its Aftermath: A major milestone in the history of Ethereum is The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack in 2016. The DAO was a very ambitious project envisioned as a decentralized venture capital fund. However, a flaw in its code was taken advantage of, and 50 million dollars in Ether were stolen. This caused a rather bitter fork, where the community was split in two: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, whose token is ETC. The reason for forking was the community\u2019s decision to get the funds back and to make the platform trustworthy.\n\n3. Reaching All-Time Highs: The price of Ethereum has been volatile over the years, which depicts the growth of the currency and people\u2019s interest in it and the crypto space as a whole. The highest Ethereum has ever been recorded was in November 2021 when one ETH was trading at above $4800. This milestone signified the escalating beliefs in the Ethereum project and cryptocurrencies with the DeFi, NFTs, and the Ethereum 2.0 launch.\n\n4. The Technology Behind Ethereum: Ethereum platform is based on implementing smart contracts and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are digital contracts that are self-executing with the terms of the contract written in code. These contracts operate on the EVM, meaning that the implementation of these contracts is done to the letter as is coded, and there are no chances of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party meddling.\n\n5. Ethereum 2. 0: An essential shift that characterizes Ethereum technology is the shift to Ethereum 2. 0, also called Eth2 or Serenity. Ethereum 2. As for the platform\u2019s major concerns such as scalability, security, and energy consumption, 0 attempts to tackle some of them. The upgrade involves moving from the proof of work (PoW) to the proof of stake (PoS).\n\n6. Proof-of-Stake (PoS): In PoS, the validators are selected to produce new blocks and check transactions depending on the number of tokens they own and are willing to pledge. This is anticipated to cut energy usage by a large margin, thus improving Ethereum\u2019s sustainability. Moreover, PoS is aimed at increasing the network capacity so that more transactions can be processed per second, eliminating the issue of high traffic and high gas fees.\n\nBenefits and Challenges\n\nBenefits\n\nDecentralization and Security: Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature ensures that there is no single point of failure for applications.\n\nInnovation Platform: Ethereum introduced the smart contract feature, which created a market of decentralized applications combined with various industries, from finance to gaming and even supply chains.\n\nInteroperability: Ethereum\u2019s open-source architecture ensures the integration and cooperation between various platforms and applications in the ecosystem.\n\nChallenges\n\nScalability Issues: Nonetheless, Ethereum has a major problem of scalability whereby the network usually gets congested and this attracts high charges. Ethereum 2. 0 also aims at solving these problems but the change is gradual and continuous.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not free from the criticism of the regulating authorities. Changes in the law on its uptake and application can influence it.\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: Smart contracts are very effective but sometimes contain errors and flaws that can lead to attacks such as the one witnessed in the DAO hack.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nSeveral prospects indicate that Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, and several important advancements are likely to strengthen its status as a dominant blockchain.\n\nEthereum 2. 0 Implementation: The complete execution of Ethereum 2. These include scalability, security, and energy efficiency, and it is expected that the 5G network 0 will offer many improvements. This upgrade may encourage developers and enterprises to deploy their applications on the Ethereum network since it is a more reliable and fast network.\n\nDeFi and NFT Growth: The DeFi and NFT markets which are closely associated with Ethereum are expected to expand in the future. DeFi applications provide financial services with no intermediaries, and NFTs are non-interchangeable digital assets that include art, virtual land, etc. For Ethereum these innovations will be vital for its to remain relevant in the future which is why the support for these innovations will be important.\n\nEnterprise Adoption: Enterprises are increasingly using blockchain solutions to enhance business aspects such as transparency, security, and efficiency. Ethereum\u2019s well-deepened ecosystem and further growth make it a valuable candidate for enterprise use, which can result in further expansion and becoming a more widespread part of business processes.\n\nCommunity and Development: The Ethereum community has been, and continues to be, very engaged and enthusiastic about the platform. This way, it is possible to constantly improve and develop the approach that corresponds to the current tendencies and issues. Given that the Ethereum\u2019s development is based on a principle of collaboration, it will most probably remain a leader in the field of block-chain technologies.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nEthereum has evolved from a unique concept to one of the most significant parts of the blockchain and cryptocurrency sphere. It has introduced the elegance of smart contracts and Decentralized applications to the world, which has completely changed the way assets are interacted with and managed.\n\nDespite the issues concerning the network, including the matters of scaling and the legal environment, the further evolution of Ethereum 2. Thus, it has a 0 ranking and strong community backing, which shows it has a bright future ahead of it. Thus, as Ethereum is constantly developing, it is ready to stay one of the leaders in the digital economy and contribute to the development of further implementations of decentralized technologies."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum is primed to mount a comeback against Bitcoin this month after underperforming its sibling cryptocurrency since the start of the year, according to K33 Research.\n\nOn the one hand, the leading smart contract platform is poised to receive its first US-listed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in July, inviting a tidal wave of new institutional demand into ETH. Meanwhile, Bitcoin holders are awaiting a 141,686 BTC ($8.8 billion) distribution from defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox\u2014a looming tsunami of potential sell pressure now ten years in the making.\n\n\u201cThe chickens of 2014 have come home to roost,\u201d wrote K33 Research in a Tuesday market update. \u201cWe expect net selling pressure to burden Bitcoin in an otherwise dry summer market, widening the chop suey range until rosier days arise as the leaves turn orange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough the crypto market has lost much of its bullish momentum since April, K33 maintains that Ethereum ETFs will absorb between 0.75% and 1% of all ETH in circulation within their first five months on the market. Though the ETF launch could spark a \u201csell the news\u201d event for ETH in the short term (much like Bitcoin ETFs in January), the firm says ETH\u2019s \u201cpositive supply dynamics\u201d will afford it \u201crelative strength\u201d over the next several months.\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate,\u201d continued K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde, \u201cand I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\u201d\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched down to 0.046 By May 24. That\u2019s when surprise news broke that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs, taking the ratio back up to 0.055 today.\n\nIndicators suggest that positive sentiment around both ETH and BTC is returning to form\u2014particularly in the futures market.\n\nBitcoin futures premiums on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are back to trading in double digits at 10.9%, according to the report. As for Ethereum, the newly launched VolatilityShares 2x leveraged ETH ETF now holds 33,700 ETH ($114 million) equivalent exposure after just 15 trading days, showing that CME traders want long-leveraged exposure to ETH right now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new ETF\u2019s popularity has helped push CME ETH open interest back towards all-time highs, currently sitting at 372,000 ETH ($1.26 billion). K33 Research said such high interest signals intent to make directional trades around ETH before the ETFs go live \u2013 though the direction of those trades remains unclear.\n\n\u201cThe soft funding rates suggest that the directional expectations are balanced, with neither bullish nor bearish positioning dominating \u2013 highlighting the uncertain market outlook and lack of consensus as ETH ETF launches are nearing,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Multiple industry analysts believe that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be on track to be launched in mid-July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to industry sources that were cited in a recent Bloomberg report, multiple applicants are supposed to submit their amended S-1 forms before July 8.\n\nAs noted by Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, this would mean that the final approval of S-1 forms is expected to take place by July 12. This would \"theoretically\" mean the launch week of July 15, according to Geraci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry after it unexpectedly greenlit rule rules changes (19b-4 forms) in May. The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a powerful rally shortly after that decision. However, that rally was short-lived since the SEC had yet to complete the two-step ETF approval process that also included S-1 forms.\n\nIn late June, SEC boss Gary Gensler stated that the approval of Ethereum ETFs was going \"smoothly\" after previously claiming that these hotly anticipated products would be able to start trading this summer.\n\nSell the news?\n\nAccording to a recent report by K33 Research, the Ethereum price might fall right after the launch of several spot ETFs in the U.S.\n\nHowever, K33 Research still expects that inflows into spot ETFs will be a boon for the price of the leading altcoin. These inflows could reach up to 1% of the cryptocurrency's total circulating supply, according to the firm.\n\nLast week, Steno Research predicted that these products could possibly attract up to $20 billion worth of inflows within the first year of their trading."

Thus, its network has recorded $2.73 billion in fee income, the most in the industry. Bitcoin, in second place, generated $1.3 billion. Closing the top three is Tron Network, with almost $460 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther networks also contributed to the overall fee income landscape. Solana generated $241.3 million, Binance's chain accumulated $176.6 million and Avalanche recorded $68.83 million. Additionally, the zkSync Era earned nearly $60 million, Optimism $40.4 million and Polygon $23.9 million.\n\nHere are the top 10 chains by 1-year fee revenue.#Ethereum earns a fee of $2.728B per year, #Bitcoin earns a fee of $1.302B per year, and #TronNetwork earns a fee of $459.39M per year. pic.twitter.com/ixAiP9g8JA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 3, 2024\n\nAs the data highlights, Ethereum has a significant lead, doubling Bitcoin's revenue.

This is what has positioned ETH as a more versatile and widely used network compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn return, Bitcoin's revenue, while still over a billion dollars, is primarily driven by its role as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. Its transaction fees are affected by network congestion and the price of BTC itself, which can fluctuate significantly.\n\nHowever, it still lacks the extensive range of applications found in the Ethereum ecosystem, resulting in lower overall fee income."

This increased the total value of assets staked on the platform by 1.26%, reaching $33.48 billion.\n\nDuring this period, Lido led in net Ethereum deposit inflows, surpassing centralized exchanges like Binance and Gate.io and the rapidly growing liquid restaking project Ether.fi.\n\nThe platform also revealed significant activity in its wrapped staked ETH (wstETH) on Layer 2 networks like Scroll, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. The total number of assets on these blockchains increased by 7.19% to 141,586, bringing the 7-day trading volume to $1.23 billion.\n\nHowever, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staked ETH decreased slightly, dropping 0.04% to 2.96%.\n\nNode decentralization\n\nLido is enhancing decentralization efforts by launching a Community Staking Module (CSM) to promote more decentralized Ethereum node operations.\n\nAccording to official documentation, CSM will integrate a diverse range of Node Operators, including Solo stakers, into the network. The module will also allow permissionless entry for node operators. It added:\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal for this module is to allow for permissionless entry to the Lido on Ethereum Node Operator set and enfranchise solo-staker participation in the protocol, increasing the total number of independent Node Operators in the overall Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nThis move would mark a clear departure from its previous approach, which required its DAO to approve a new node operator before its addition to the platform. However, its current initiative would allow solo staking to become more attractive and accessible for interest validators by introducing \u201creasonably low bond for Node Operators\u201d and requiring \u201cno secondary token collateral.\u201d\n\nThe module is in early adoption mode on the Holesky testnet and is expected to transition to a permissionless state on July 11, 2024.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is hanging on the edge at $3,365, as this price level is actually far more important than you might think. The asset has clearly gained serious ground for a reversal after breaking above the 100 EMA, but right now, ETH is in some trouble and may reach $3,000 quite soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has historically held up at this critical support level, which is located roughly where the $3,365 level is. If Ether were to fall below this mark, it would indicate that this support is no longer there and will probably descend to $3,000. This is the next significant psychological level. The 100 EMA frequently serves as a reliable gauge of the general trend, and a break below it may trigger a large sell-off.\n\nThe 200 EMA is the only significant support level between the 100 EMA and the 200 EMA in terms of technical support aside from the 200 EMA, which is located much further below. Ethereum may see a swift decline to the 200 EMA level, or roughly $3,000 in case of a breakdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only has Ethereum broken above the 100 EMA, but it has also broken below the consolidation channel it has been trading in for the last few weeks. This channel has given traders some predictability by providing a range in which ETH has moved. A break below $3,365 would mean that the market is leaving this channel to the downside, suggesting that the trend may be turning from bullish to bearish and potentially causing more losses.\n\nThe 100 EMA serves as a key support level, and a break below it might cause ETH to move rapidly toward $3,000 because there would be no other support level. Furthermore, a breach below this level would indicate a break out of the current consolidation channel and could indicate a reversal of the bearish trend."

Ethereum Name Service increased by 41% over the past week, signalling a solid uptrend with further upside potential. In a broader sense, ENS headed up nearly 14% over the past 30 days, testifying to this token\u2019s sheer resilience and growth potential.\n\nThis impressive surge can be attributed mainly to Bitcoin\u2019s price rebound. The upward momentum that Bitcoin\u2019s rise created for altcoins has given them room for losses to recover and set their eyes on new highs. With the lead set by this top cryptocurrency, Ethereum Name Service and other altcoins follow through in a continuum, further benefiting from renewed investor confidence.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Name Service stands at $31.90, with a trading volume of $1.17 billion within the last 24 hours and a market capitalization of $1.00 billion. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum Name Service has added 10.54% to its value, additional backing for what is already an extraordinary cryptocurrency market player.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) Sees Remarkable Growth, Eyes $120 Target 4\n\nAnalyst Sees Potential for $120 for Ethereum Name Service (ENS)\n\nCrypto analyst Matthew Hyland believes in an optimistic price trajectory for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). As per Hyland, if it breaks out from its current levels, Ethereum Name Service will reach as high as $120. Hyland\u2019s bullish prediction came from ENS\u2019s recent performance.\n\nThe analyst mentioned that he had recommended this to his Patreon subscribers when it was $17.50, exactly on the night of the ETH ETF approval a few weeks ago. Unaffectedly, with ENS currently trading at around $30 and showing every sign of attempting a breakout, this recommendation has paid off.\n\nHyland\u2019s insights and predictions give further weight to the growing confidence placed by the crypto community in ENS. His price target of $120 foreshadows a substantial upside potential from current levels, so it has emerged as one of the cryptocurrencies investors will watch over the next few months.\n\nAs ENS values surge, many opportunities emerge within the crypto market, gaining optimism from well-esteemed analysts like Hyland. The eyes of investors and enthusiasts are fastened on Ethereum Name Service, hoping for more significant gains as the market evolves.\n\nRelated Reading | Ethereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts"

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs are on the cusp of trading.\n\nNot only could prices go up, but also analysts expect massive inflows into the funds.\n\nInvestors will pour up to $500 million into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds in their first week.\n\nThat\u2019s according to crypto exchange OKX\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai.\n\n\u201cWhile the AUM of ETH ETFs may not be as high as BTC ETFs, their trading volumes can reach a similar level,\u201d he told DL News.\n\nLai added that the launch of the new funds will invariably kick off a new crypto rally, echoing wider industry sentiment.\n\nNine prospective applicants are waiting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to green light their ETFs.\n\nMarket watchers expect spot Ethereum ETFs to launch some time after the Independence Day holiday.\n\nRecord inflows\n\nLai isn\u2019t alone in his bullishness.\n\nCCData analyst Jacob Joseph told DL News that inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs will reach $3.9 billion within the first 100 days of trading.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has similarly said spot Ethereum ETFs could enjoy inflows to the tune of $15 billion within the first 18 months of trading.\n\nPrice action\n\nNot only would ETFs make crypto more attractive to investors, but the fact that 27% of Ethereum is locked up could drive prices higher, experts say.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to scarcity in the short-term, hence price increases, and make ETH an attractive option for institutional asset allocation,\u201d Lai said.\n\nLekker Capital founder Quinn Thompson has suggested that Ethereum could surge to $7,000.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone is convinced that a rally will kick off when these funds launch.\n\nThe \u201cexpectations of crypto natives are overinflated and disconnected from the true preferences of TradFi allocators,\u201d Andrew Kang, managing partner at investment firm Mechanism Capital, wrote on X.\n\nHe also argued that while Bitcoin did soar to record highs on the back of spot Bitcoin ETFs launching, it was only a contributing factor \u2014 with big players like MicroStrategy buying the asset having drummed up demand.\n\nThe co-head of digital assets at broker dealer giant TP Icap, Duncan Trenholme, similarly told DL News that Ethereum ETFs are going to be a harder sell for large-scale institutional investors like pension funds.\n\nWhy? Because Ethereum lacks the clear narrative that Bitcoin has as a store of value.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethereum, Trenholme said he fielded questions from institutional clients like, \u201cIs Ether just Bitcoin Lite?\u201d \u201cHow is it different from Bitcoin?\u201d or \u201cWhy should it have a place in an investment portfolio?\u201d\n\nDespite the bearishness, analysts at research firm Bernstein say the launch of Ethereum ETFs will drive prices higher in the long run as they\u2019ll lead to more adoption.\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

        "content": "Galaxy Digital head of asset management Steve Kurz said the SEC could approve a spot Ethereum ETF before the end of July and described prospects for other crypto ETFs.\n\nOn July 2, Kurz told Bloomberg that he expects approvals in \u201cweeks, not days\u201d and within the month.\n\nKurz said Galaxy has worked with the SEC on applications for months and noted the firm\u2019s upcoming spot Ethereum ETF is similar to its existing spot Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). Galaxy created both funds in partnership with the investment management firm Invesco.\n\nKurz said:\n\n\u201cWe know the plumbing, we know the process\u2026 The SEC is engaged.\u201d\n\nPossibility of more crypto ETFs\n\nKurz also expressed optimism about approvals for other spot crypto ETFs beyond Ethereum. He said that legislation, including laws defining securities, is necessary and that he believes the process will occur even if Joe Biden remains president.\n\nKurz cited Bitcoin ETF performance as a sign of demand, stating:\n\n\u201cPeople want this. Retail wants this, investors want this.\u201d\n\nTwo firms recently proposed ETFs for Solana (SOL). Kurz said that although Galaxy has high exposure to Solana and is the blockchain\u2019s largest validator, broad legislation permitting new crypto ETFs is more important than an ETF focused on any single crypto.\n\nHe also believes that a Solana CME futures market is a prerequisite for a Solana spot ETF. No SOL futures market currently exists.\n\nPredictions in line with Balchunas\n\nGalaxy\u2019s expectations are in line with the latest predictions from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who expects spot Ethereum ETFs to launch shortly after July 8.\n\nBalchunas said the SEC has asked spot Ethereum ETF issuers to amend their S-1 registration forms by July 8. The agency may seek further amendments.\n\nBalchunas previously predicted the funds would launch by July 2.\n\nOn May 23, the SEC approved 19-b4 rule changes that allow exchanges to list and trade each fund. However, those approvals did not permit asset managers to issue funds.\n\nAsset managers now await approval of their S-1 and S-3 registration funds, which will finally allow them to launch their Ethereum ETFs for trading.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETFs] in the U.S., the community has been awaiting the arrival of Ethereum ETFs. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum faced its own set of hurdles. But things seem to be falling into place as the approval for ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] could be weeks away.\n\nAccording to Steve Kurz, the head of asset management at Galaxy Digital Ether ETFs, they will most likely get a green signal sometime in July. He believes that the ETFs are currently in the \u201cwindow dressing\u201d stage. Kurz added,\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ve done this before. This is methodical, this is window dressing, and the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now, we did it with the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2014 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there are a total of eight firms lined up for approval of Ethereum ETFs. This covers BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Fidelity, iShares, Galaxy Digital, Grayscale, and 21Shares. These companies have already received permission to list their shares on exchanges. But before their shares can be traded, they must receive clearance for their S-1 filing.\n\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency: 3 ETH Coins To Stash Before Ethereum ETF Boom\n\nCan This Approval Boost the Price of Ethereum in July?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,349.33 following a 2.58% daily drop. According to Changelly, ETH will surge to a high of $3,555.49. The average trading price for the altcoin will remain around $3,510. Ethereum could mostly see a bigger surge considering the current hype around spot ETFs.\n\nIn addition, a K33 Research analysis revealed that Ether ETFs would be a \u201cgolden egg\u201d for the altcoin\u2019s price. Ethereum could even beat Bitcoin in the initial weeks following its launch.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ETFs: $5B Net Inflows Expected in First 6 Months"

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Surge in 2024? What Traders Should Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "As 2024 progresses and the cryptocurrency market keeps evolving, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, stands as a strong contender, garnering the attention of both investors and traders. With various developments in the pipeline, and a volatile market to deal with, there are speculations about ETH price will surge this year. This article delves into the key factors that could influence Ethereum price in 2024 and what traders should keep an eye on.\n\nRecent Market Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum price has experienced challenges in the market, having declined by 2.8% in the past day to trade today at $3,357.89. The past month was not friendly either, with the token recorded losses of about 12.17%. With a market cap of $403.6 billion, and a trading volume of $10.8 billion, ETH remains a strong contender among cryptocurrencies. Although the coin achieved its all-time high milestone of $4,891.70 on November 16, 2021, it has since dropped in price by 31.32%.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price in 2024\n\n1. Ethereum Upgrades and Developments\n\nIn 2024, the Ethereum network will experience several major enhancements. The ongoing \u201cSharding\u201d is designed to improve the network\u2019s scalability even more.\n\nSharding will enable Ethereum to handle numerous transactions at once, easing congestion and decreasing gas fees. Anticipated enhancements in technology are likely to draw in additional developers and users to the platform, potentially increasing the need for ETH\n\n2. Institutional Adoption\n\nInterest from institutions in Ethereum is increasing. Many big financial institutions are starting to incorporate Ethereum in their activities, whether through investing directly, using DeFi apps, or creating products based on Ethereum.\n\nIn 2024, the anticipated introduction of Ethereum ETFs could potentially unlock the doors for a surge of institutional funds. These advancements are expected to increase investor trust and encourage interest in ETH.\n\n3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion\n\nEthereum has been behind the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. The sector has seen an increasing number of assets on Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms and yield farming are innovations on DeFI continuing to gain traction.\n\nAs the ecosystem expands, the demand and utility for ETH are likely to increase, positively impacting its price.\n\n4. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Metaverse\n\nEthereum is also making big advancements in the metaverse and NFT areas. The popularity of virtual real estate, collectibles and digital arts is driving demand for ETH, especially since most NFTs are created on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nMost NFTs are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. As the concept of metaverse develops, the role of Ethereum in fueling these virtual worlds could result in higher adoption, leading to increase in ETH price.\n\n5. Regulatory Environment\n\nThe regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies still has both positive and negative aspects. Although clear regulations can support growth, overly strict policies may hinder innovation and discourage investment.\n\nTraders need to monitor regulatory changes worldwide, as they could affect the price of Ethereum. Favorable ETF approvals or supportive blockchain policies could trigger price surges as positive regulatory updates.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Market Sentiment\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) technical analysis shows a complex situation with indicators like EMA, MACD, RSI, and Fibonacci levels. EMA signals \u2018Sell\u2019, hinting at a bearish trend, with potential support at $3,090.3.\n\nMACD at -47.4 suggests selling due to bearish momentum, while RSI at 41.2 is neutral but near oversold levels. Fibonacci levels indicate support at $3,266.8 and resistance at $3,767.7, offering insights on potential price movements.\n\nFalling below $3,266.8 could lead to further drops, while surpassing $3,767.7 might indicate bullish momentum.\n\nWhat Traders Should Know\n\n1. Stay Informed: Staying updated about Ethereum\u2019s technical upgrades and their schedules is essential. Effective execution of these improvements could signify a significant uptrend.\n\n2. Monitor Institutional Movements: Pay attention to updates from large financial institutions about their participation in Ether. Higher adoption by institutions can result in noticeable price gains.\n\n3. Follow DeFi and NFT Trends: The rise of DeFi and NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem shows the high demand and usefulness of ETH. Monitoring these industries can offer understanding of potential price fluctuations.\n\n4. Regulatory News: Keep informed about regulatory changes happening across the world. Favorable regulatory updates may result in optimistic market outlook, while unfavorable news can elicit the opposite reaction.\n\n5. Technical Analysis: Make use of technical indicators for insight into market trends and possible entry and exit points. This can assist in forming informed decisions when trading\n\nConclusion\n\nthereum faces a critical juncture in 2024, driven by tech advancements, institutional attention, and the evolving DeFi and NFT sectors. Despite current bearish trends, the long-term outlook is optimistic with the upcoming upgrades and potential ETF greenlights. Traders must stay alert to market shifts and regulations to seize Ethereum\u2019s anticipated growth in 2024 through informed decision-making and technical analysis."

        "title": "Ethereum Staking: A Guide to Earning Rewards and Securing Network - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum, a major cryptocurrency, has become more eco-friendly and secure by using a new system called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This new system lets you earn rewards for just holding onto your Ethereum (ETH) and helping to keep the network safe.\n\nThis guide explains what staking ETH is, how it works, and different ways to do it. Even if you\u2019re new to crypto, this guide will help you understand how staking ETH can be a great way to get involved in the exciting world of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Staking?\n\nEthereum staking is the process of locking ETH on the Ethereum blockchain and participating in verifying transactions. This method sees users locking in their ETH as a \u201cstake\u201d or \u201cdeposit\u201d as a guarantee against them verifying and validating Ethereum transactions.\n\nBy staking ETH, users qualify to become validators with granted privileges of broadcasting transactions on the blockchain, maintaining the distributed database, and securing the network. These validators are rewarded with transaction fees and a predefined yield on their staked amount.\n\nFollowing the Merge upgrade, which went live in September 2022, Ethereum was transited into using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from the Proof-of-Work (PoW). This upgrade marked a significant milestone for ETH which changed its fundamental infrastructure.\n\nBefore the adoption of PoS consensus, Ethereum validators tended to use heavy electricity for verifying transactions just like Bitcoin. Now its electricity consumption is drastically reduced and the network efficiency is improved from the ground level.\n\nBy implementing a staking mechanism, Ethereum has also unlocked numerous economic benefits for its ever-evolving ecosystem. For instance, data from Ultrasound.money shows that the rate of increment in ETH supply has steadily decreased post the Merge upgrade and it is also helping maintaining ETH scarcity by burning significant supply regularly.\n\nBenefits of Staking ETH\n\nEthereum provides numerous benefits to users and entities who wish to participate in staking and securing the blockchain network. Below are some key benefits of staking on Ethereum for users:\n\n1. Passive Rewards\n\nThe primary benefit of staking ETH is getting rewarded in exchange with newly minted ETH as block rewards plus transaction fees. As a validator, users who stake ETH get to verify transactions and add them into blocks. Each of these transactions have associated gas fees which are rewarded to that particular validator who verifies it and adds it to the blockchain network.\n\n2. Network Effects\n\nStaking is a crucial element for PoS blockchain networks like Ethereum as it makes it secure and decentralized. As stakers are responsible for verifying and validating transactions, it is necessary for them to function in a fair and transparent manner so that the security of the blockchain network is preserved.\n\n3. Sustainability\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is periodically locked in the system so that its economical value remains sustained until it is unstaked. This brings prolific sustainability and empowers value creation within the blockchain ecosystem. Locking of ETH also contributes to narrowing the selling pressure in live markets.\n\nHow to Stake ETH\n\nThere are different ways to stake ETH and harness its benefits. All these staking methods are separate from one another on the basis of technicality, reward bars, and ease of implementation.\n\nLet\u2019s understand it all in detail;\n\nSolo Staking\n\nThe method of Solo Staking involves setting up a node on Ethereum with a manual process. It is also known as native staking where stakers directly interact with the Ethereum network. The solo stakers will participate in securing the network all by themselves with their hardware devices to verify and validate transactions.\n\nAlthough it requires 32 ETH as a staking deposit for a node to become a validator and secure the network. Additionally, a sophisticated computer system is also essential for an Ethereum client to run, which is the software containing information on the whole blockchain. Such requirements make solo staking a hefty process and burden to people with no such experience in software engineering.\n\nHowever, this method represents the gold standard for staking on Ethereum with higher responsibilities than other methods and higher staking rewards. To run a node and become a solo staker, it\u2019s recommended to follow the official guide from Ethereum.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nAs the interest in ETH staking has grown rapidly, many \u201cStaking as a Service\u201d platforms have arrived in the past few years. These platforms allow you to stake ETH as a third-party service provider which then manages all your technical requirements including node set-up and hardware. It means that users can benefit from staking rewards without being worried about running their own validator node on Ethereum.\n\nThis method essentially enables non-technical users to participate in stalking while leaving technical aspects to someone else. All it requires is for users to generate keys and deposit 32 ETH for service providers. In exchange for their service, these staking service providers will charge minimal fees from staking rewards and send back the remaining rewards to users.\n\nStaking Pools\n\nStaking Pools allow individuals to stake a flexible amount of ETH instead of the standard 32 ETH in order to partake into staking. It enables earning staking rewards without the need for extensive technical knowledge or running their validator node. Instead of staking alone, users can send their ETH to a liquidity pool from where combined staking is initiated. Once a pool reaches to 32 ETH by collective deposits from different users, it automatically deploys a node and starts functioning as a validator.\n\nThis innovative staking method makes it possible for users to contribute any ETH amount and secure Ethereum network as a validator. Then the pool operator entity uses all the shared deposits to join the native staking on Ethereum. When staking pools receive rewards, it is distributed to participants in accordance with their initial stake.\n\nStaking on Exchanges\n\nOne of the easiest and most convenient methods of staking ETH is accessing it via centralized crypto exchanges. It involves depositing of ETH to a centralized exchange platform which offers staking facility. This is usually regarded as the safest and most handy staking process as exchanges provide guarantees to users for security as well as rewards.\n\nAlthough the exchanges require to send ETH to their wallets and giveaway asset custody which possesses risk for users. It essentially means that exchanges retain ownership of user\u2019s assets and the risk of loss is increased. Most of the popular exchanges offer staking services to users including Binance, ByBit, Coinbase, and others.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem, staking opens up exciting opportunities for users to participate in blockchain security and earn rewards. Ethereum stays at the forefront of staking with its robust position among blockchain networks. Staking ETH not only offers economic benefits but also contributes to the decentralization, security, and stability of the Ethereum network."

Discover SCENE\n\nRumors that the widely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 will utilize cryptocurrency have been circulating for more than a year now\u2014and they\u2019re swirling again.\n\nOn Wednesday, a pseudonymous Crypto Twitter influencer called Gordon\u2014apparently named after Gordon Gekko from the iconic 1987 film \u201cWall Street\u201d\u2014shared to his nearly 500,000 followers that \u201cGTA 6 will enable cryptocurrency payments,\u201d and that \u201cso far only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT [are] confirmed.\u201d\n\nBut in reality, no cryptocurrencies have been confirmed for Grand Theft Auto 6, despite the ongoing chatter around the rumors. Rockstar Games and parent company Take-Two made no such announcements this week on the matter, nor previously, and the official trailers and announcements have made zero mention of crypto inclusion.\n\nHowever, the tweet\u2014which also included a fake trailer for the game\u2014quickly went viral, with more than 500,000 views as of this writing after just a matter of hours. When Twitter users asked Gordon for his sourcing, he\u2019d jokingly reply that his \u201cuncle works there,\u201d or say that previous reports on the matter were \u201cold\u201d at this point.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFake news. \u2014 BORED (@BoredElonMusk) July 3, 2024\n\nBut in truth, nothing has changed since Decrypt\u2019s GG reported on earlier rumors in May 2023, nor since the first official trailer\u2014which initially leaked with \u201cBUY BTC\u201d stamped on it, apparently by the leaker in question\u2014debuted last December.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s GG reached out to Rockstar Games for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nCould Grand Theft Auto 6 implement a crypto element when it launches in 2025? It\u2019s certainly possible, and if so, it would be a transformative moment for the embrace of cryptocurrency by the traditional gaming industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTake-Two Interactive has previously explored the space, acquiring casual gaming giant Zynga in early 2022 as Take-Two founder and CEO Strauss Zelnick suggested there were \u201cWeb3 opportunities\u201d they could explore better as a team. Zynga has since launched its first blockchain game on Ethereum, called Sugartown, but Take-Two still hasn\u2019t dabbled with its other brands.\n\nRockstar Games, on the other hand, banned the use of cryptocurrency or NFTs on player-run Grand Theft Auto 5 servers in late 2022, following a surge in the use of NFTs to represent unique, player-owned assets within modified game servers.\n\nAnd given Grand Theft Auto\u2019s satirical tone, the game might be more likely to skewer cryptocurrency and poke fun at caricatures of crypto and NFT die-hards, for example, rather than try to launch its own on-chain coin. But that\u2019s all speculation at this point, as there are relatively few official details around GTA 6.\n\nFor now, at least, don\u2019t believe the hype. While Rockstar Games hasn\u2019t officially closed the door on cryptocurrency being used in Grand Theft Auto 6, it also hasn\u2019t confirmed anything at all on that front. It\u2019s sure to remain a hot topic in the long run-up to release, however, which is currently pegged for fall 2025.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF arriving in July - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "There is still uncertainty about the date of the actual listing on the stock exchange of spot Ethereum ETFs in the USA, but the chances that this may happen by the end of the month seem to be increasing.\n\nThere are indeed many experts and analysts who expect the definitive landing as early as next week, or in any case within the following two weeks.\n\nThe hypothesis of Galaxy Digital on the imminent approval of Ethereum ETFs\n\nYesterday Bloomberg interviewed the head of asset management at Galaxy Digital Ether ETF, Steve Kurz, who stated that spot Ethereum ETFs are very likely to be definitively approved by the SEC in the current month of July.\n\nAccording to Kurz, the requests are currently in a phase of \u201cwindow dressing\u201d.\n\nThe expert from Galaxy Digital reminded that the SEC has already done this before, and despite being almost identical products to those already approved in January on Bitcoin, he called it a way to embellish the procedure.\n\nIt should be noted that Galaxy Digital is one of the eight companies that has applied to the SEC to issue a spot Ethereum ETF, along with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Fidelity, iShares, Grayscale, and 21Shares.\n\nAll have already received authorization to list the shares of their ETFs on ETH on the stock exchange, but before they can actually be listed and made tradable, they must receive authorization for the S-1 form.\n\nThe window dressing\n\nIn the financial sector, \u201cwindow dressing\u201d refers to the practice of embellishing a portfolio or a balance sheet, for example, by selecting or modifying certain information, in order to make them appear more attractive or better performing.\n\nFor example, in the case of investment portfolios, positions are carefully chosen to present in such a way as to make the portfolio appear more diversified or with better returns.\n\nObviously, it is considered a deceptive practice, or at least not very transparent, because it creates false expectations or gives a distorted image.\n\nIn this specific case the SEC needs somehow to present these ETFs as something positive, given that for years it has stood against both Ethereum and crypto ETFs.\n\nLast year it took a court ruling to force the SEC to approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as it had always rejected them in the past, making a mistake.\n\nThis year, however, it is likely that a diktat has come from above, given that it is still a government agency and in a year of presidential elections, evidently the candidate running again (Joe Biden) wanted to avoid irritating investors and the markets.\n\nSo in this specific case, window dressing might not be entirely misleading, even if it involves making formal changes to the requests to make them appear more in line with the expectations of the SEC.\n\nThe landing on the USA stock exchange of Ethereum ETFs\n\nIn the case of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the actual listing on the stock exchange occurred the day after approval.\n\nIn the case of spot Ethereum ETFs, only the requests have been approved for now, but the procedure is not complete. It is necessary for the SEC to also approve the final form, the S-1, which the various applicant companies have already submitted.\n\nTomorrow is the 4th of July, and in the USA it is a national holiday.\n\nFriday it is unlikely that the SEC can meet for final approval, also because before it can do so the window dressing phase must be completed.\n\nIt was expected that the final approval could arrive on Monday, but in the current state, perhaps it is already a lot if it manages to arrive next week.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that once the final overall approval is obtained, the issuing companies will race to list their ETFs on the stock exchange as quickly as possible, and this means that the listing should take place the day after the definitive approval.\n\nThe forecasts\n\nIn reality, the main uncertainty is the one concerning the potential success of these new financial products on the USA stock exchanges.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin in January, the success was resounding, so much so that the price of BTC went from $45,000 to over $70,000.\n\nInstead, in the case of Ethereum, a much more moderate success is expected, although to be honest, the markets seem to be skeptical about a true and proper success of these ETFs on ETH spot.\n\nThe options market on ETH currently shows a positive sentiment regarding the launch of ETFs in the medium/short term, as happened for Bitcoin, but at this moment the Ethereum spot market does not show any bull signs.\n\nThere is therefore a discrepancy, with on one side the spot market that does not seem to be optimistic, while on the other side the derivatives market seems to be.\n\nThe only certain thing is that there is no sign of true and proper euphoria.\n\nAt this point, it is possible to imagine that something similar to what happens in January after the actual stock market debut of the new spot BTC ETFs occurs. That is, a drop in the weeks immediately following, lasting less than 30 days, and then a rebound.\n\nThe sales\n\nThe problem is that with the actual landing on the stock exchange, two waves of selling could be triggered.\n\nThe first is that of those who will do the classic sell-the-news, after having done the buy-the-rumors, given that the news of the approval is not yet 100% certain.\n\nThe second, much more dangerous, is that of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which just like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust could be forced to liquidate a large part of the underlying (ETH) once transformed into an ETF and listed on the stock exchange.\n\nIn January this dynamic lasted less than two weeks, also because then the other ETFs started buying more BTC than Grayscale was liquidating.\n\nSo if the actual listing on the stock exchange of spot Ethereum ETFs should take place around mid-July, it is possible to imagine a drop in the price of ETH until the end of the month, and then perhaps a rebound in August."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs could launch any day now.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts predict Ethereum ETFs will get about only 20% of the demand that Bitcoin ETFs experienced.\n\nBitwise CIO Matt Hougan argued that marketing Ethereum as a technology play could help the products surpass expectations.\n\nSpot Ethereum exchange-traded funds will launch any day now.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a chance these ETFs will greatly outperform expectations, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto index fund Bitwise, argued in a Monday report.\n\nThe key, Hougan said, is to market Ethereum as a big technology play.\n\n\u201cInvestors love technology stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cNearly all investors have exposure to high-growth tech plays like Nvidia and Meta, and relatively few have exposure to monetary assets like gold.\u201d\n\nMarketing Ethereum in two words\n\nBitcoin was created with a supply hard cap \u2014 there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence.\n\nFor that reason, the top cryptocurrency has often been described as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d and promoted as a potential hedge against currency debasement.\n\nBut marketing Ethereum isn\u2019t so easy.\n\n\u201dOne of the challenges for Ethereum ETFs in penetrating the 60/40 boomer world is distilling its purpose/value into an easy-to-understand soundbite a la \u2018Bitcoin is digital gold,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in May.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAfter all, calling it a \u201cdecentralised, open-source, and distributed computing platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralised applications, also known as dApps\u201d hardly makes it easy for outsiders to understand what Ethereum actually does.\n\nIt\u2019s for that reason \u2014 and because Ethereum futures ETFs have done poorly \u2014 that Balchunas expects spot Ethereum ETFs to attract only 15% to 20% of the demand that Bitcoin ETFs experienced.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have hauled in roughly $14.6 billion since their launch in January.\n\nTechnology play\n\nBut Ethereum ETFs could \u201csurprise to the upside\u201d if financial advisers market the product as a technology play, Hougan said.\n\nThat means completely separating Ethereum from Bitcoin in investors\u2019 minds. And make it clear that while Bitcoin competes with gold, Ethereum is a centre of technological development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy for me to imagine investors selling a small amount of their tech exposure and adding Ether,\u201d Hougan said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d argue it\u2019s easier than imagining investors carving out an entirely separate portfolio sleeve for a new monetary asset [like Bitcoin,]\u201d he added.\n\nHougan isn\u2019t the only one advocating for Ethereum ETFs to be marketed that way\n\nEthereum ETFs will serve as proxy vehicles to anyone seeking exposure to everything that has to do with blockchain, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, stated on X.\n\nThat would include tokenisation, smart contracts, DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs.\n\n\u201cRemember that old saying \u2018I believe in blockchain, but I\u2019m not sure about Bitcoin.\u2019 Now that expression is accessible for traditional investors,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

The slide in BTC had an impact on other altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Tether, Dogecoin , Avalanche, and Shiba Inu which were down by up to 2.5%.Altcoins that were trading in the green around this time included Solana, XRP , Toncoin, Cardano, and Tron which gained up to 2%.The crypto market's lackluster trade could be attributed to the remarks by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish statement which said that the Central Bank needs more evidence on inflation to decide on the timing of the rate cuts. Moreover, the May jobs data was reported higher-than-expected.Bitcoin's decline reflects both concerns and opportunities in the crypto market, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO at Unocoin said as he highlighted strong trading volume of $20 billion over the past day, indicating significant market activity. \"The news suggests that large holders of Bitcoin, known as whales, are piling up, indicating confidence in a potential year-end rally,\" he said.Vishwanath said that BTC is currently finding support within an ascending channel of around $61,700 though it faces resistance at the 50-day EMA at $62,210, suggesting a limited immediate upside. \"With the RSI at 48, indicating neutral sentiment, the market is depending on Bitcoin's ability to hold above $61,700 to avoid a deeper decline to the $60,700 and $60,000 support levels,\" he added.Source: CoinMarketCapOn the BTC price movement, CoinDCX Research Team in a note said that the current drop filled most of the weekend BTC CME gap, though another gap remains around $59,700-$59,800 which suggests that BTC could drop further to fill it.Currently, Solana is outperforming BTC and ETH due to ETF hype, the note said, adding that the market is slightly negative due to bearishness in BTC.\"Bitcoin has been consolidating around $61,000 for the past 24 hours, following some profit-taking by traders. It's having a hard time breaking past the $63,600 resistance level. If it doesn't manage to hold its current position, Bitcoin might drop back to the $60,800 support level, with bulls trying to keep it above that mark,\" Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex warned.He pins his hopes on approval to Ether ETFs which he said could improve the market sentiments.Also Read: Gold\u2019s 13% uptick beats Nifty's H1CY24 gains.

        "content": "XRP\u2019s price is likely to breach $3 if it follows Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory as ETH clinches VanEck\u2019s $22,000 price target.\n\nThe current trading environment for cryptocurrencies is marked by significant volatility, with both Ethereum (ETH) and XRP experiencing significant declines. Notably, Ethereum typically moves in correlation with Bitcoin (BTC), and XRP usually follows the path set by both assets during market uptrends and downturns.\n\nWith Bitcoin now trading below the psychologically significant $65,000 threshold, Ethereum has equally collapsed underneath $3,500. Similarly, XRP price trades below the $0.50 support. Due to this correlation during the market dump, experts believe all three assets would secure similar surges when a recovery comes.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nVanEck Predicts Ethereum to $22,000\n\nEach token has been a subject of price speculation and projections. As of now, Ethereum stands at $3,435. Earlier this month, VanEck, a prominent asset manager, made an ambitious prediction that Ethereum could soar to $22,000. This forecast follows the U.S. SEC\u2019s recent partial approval of spot Ethereum ETF filings, which could be a game-changer for the market.\n\nVanEck\u2019s optimistic outlook on Ethereum suggests a possible rebound and impressive growth. If Ethereum reaches this predicted value, it will likely have far-reaching effects on the wider cryptocurrency market, including XRP.\n\nSuch impact materialized when ETH spiked 19% in a day last month as speculation of the SEC\u2019s spot ETH ETF approval gained steam. Interestingly, XRP price recorded a surge as well but only managed a 5.51% intraday gain on May 20. XRP eventually surpassed $0.55 the next day.\n\nXRP Price if It Follows Ethereum\u2019s Trajectory\n\nNotably, if Ethereum rises from $3,435 to $22,000, as predicted by VanEck, it would represent a staggering 540.60% increase. If XRP experienced a similar percentage growth, its price could see a substantial jump. Applying this percentage increase to XRP\u2019s current price of $0.4783, we find that XRP could potentially reach around $3.065.\n\nWhile this price is still below XRP\u2019s all-time high of $3.31 in January 2018, it represents a significant level from which the crypto asset could surge to greater heights. Meanwhile, market analysts predict more substantial targets for XRP price, with the most recent projections setting goals at $49 and $36."

It seemed ready for a larger breakout but only if Ethereum gained more strength against Bitcoin, thus breaking above the resistance at 0.055.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the rebound to $3,445, the technical outlook may not be convincing enough especially with resistance foreseen at $3,500, $3,600, and $3,800. Key fundamentals like the decentralized finance (DeFi) Total Value Locked (TVL), and the crypto fear and greed index reinforce the bearish grip on ETH.\n\nThe immediate support at between $3,200 and $3,300 must hold this week to prevent further losses to $3,000, considering it may be too early to rule out an extended drop to the next key level at $2,800.\n\nETH/BTC Price Prediction: Is Ethereum Price Gearing Up For 25% Breakout\n\nEthereum has in the last few weeks drastically gained against the largest cryptocurrency such that the ETH/BTC trading pair tested the inverse head and shoulder (H&S) pattern\u2019s neckline resistance twice.\n\nEther bulls seem ready to continue with the uptrend above 0.055\u2014in a move that could ignite a 25% rally to 0.069. An inverse H&S pattern is bullish and often signals the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a sustainable uptrend.\n\nNevertheless, the pattern remains unvalidated until the price breaches the neckline resistance. In the ETH/BTC pair\u2019s case, this is the seller congestion at 0.055.\n\nThe Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) add credence to the likely breakout, with the 20-day EMA holding as the immediate support at 0.05461. A golden cross on the same daily chart lingers as the 50-day EMA in red crosses above the 200-day EMA in purple.\n\nOn top of the golden cross, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a lot of potential for the trading pair, holding above the midline at 50. Should the RSI close the gap to the overbought region at 70, the path of least resistance will remain upwards, further accentuating the breakout to 0.069.\n\nWhat To Watch Out For In Ether Price This Week\n\nA breakout is also looming in Ethereum price based on the technical structure backed by a soon-to-be-sent buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the daily chart.\n\nDespite the encouraging bullish outlook, ETH price holds between a rock and a hard place, with support provided by the 0.5% Fibonacci ratio and a confluence resistance established at $3,467 by the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA.\n\nIf the hurdle caves in, traders would push the bullish case, targeting a breakout to $4,000 this week. However, such a move will not happen in a vacuum, considering the two resistance levels at $3,600 and $3,800.\n\nWith the approval of Ethereum ETFs imminent in July, market sentiment is expected to improve exponentially and this might catalyze the rally above $4,000. The CoinGape Ethereum price prediction shows a vivid map for ETH\u2019s recovery to the previous all-time high. It is possible Ether could debut above $5,000 reaching a new record high.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Has Ethereum price bottomed? Ethereum price has likely bottomed with support at $3,200. However, the following weeks will determine the direction the coin takes. 2. Has the Ethereum bull run ended? The technical structure shows that Ethereum still has room for growth. With spot ETH ETF approval imminent, there\u2019s a high chance the bull run has not started. 3. What is a spot ETF? This is an investment product that tracks the real-time price of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It allows investors to seek exposure to digital assets without buying physical coins on crypto exchanges. ETFs are purchased directly on stock exchanges.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Ethereum saw a downturn despite strong beginnings.\n\nThe postponement of ETH ETFs by the SEC sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community.\n\nAfter a strong kickoff on the first day of Q3 of 2024, Ethereum [ETH] has flipped back to a bearish trend once again. As reported by CoinMarketCap, ETH, at press time, dropped by 1.11% over the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, despite this recent downturn, technical indicators like MACD and RSI suggested a potential shift from sellers to buyers.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was approaching a critical resistance level at around $3538, and a breakthrough could signal the onset of a bullish phase for the largest altcoin.\n\nWhy is ETH down?\n\nProviding some light on the current price situation of ETH, analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart confirmed that the SEC has set a new deadline \u2014 the 8th of July \u2014 for submission of the forms.\n\n\u201cUnfort think we gonna have to push back our over/under till after holiday.

        "content": "In the last two weeks, investors have pulled out $120 million from ETH-focused investment products.\n\nEther spot ETF launch timeline has been moved after the SEC asked issuers to resubmit amended S-1 drafts.\n\nEthereum [ETH] was trading at around $3,448 on the 2nd of July, barely unchanged in the last few hours but in conformance with the generally positive July narrative.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH bulls targeted fresh heights above $3,450 and were betting on upside potential from the hype around Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe new products, expected to debut in the U.S. later this month, could help propel ETH/USDT above the $3,630 resistance, where it was rejected on the 17th of June.\n\nBullish speculators suffered mild losses on the 1st of July after Ethereum failed to sustain momentum above $3,520.\n\nETH attempted to break out from the descending channel on the 4-hour timeframe chart overnight on the day, but as of press time, has been unable to cement the move.\n\nMarkedly, the latest advance toward $3,500 will not amount to triumph for bulls if ETH is unable to sail above the $3,520 \u2014 $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum institutional uptake\n\nIn its digital asset flows report released on Monday, CoinShares observed that Ethereum investment products posted outflows of $60.7 million last week.\n\nThe figure marked the most significant negative 7-day flow in almost two years, and brought the cumulative two-week outflows to $119 million.\n\nThe report further highlighted that Ethereum was the worst-performing crypto asset in 2024, based on net flows, with\u2014$37 million and\u2014$25 million MTD and YTD flows, respectively.\n\nU.S. Ethereum spot ETF\n\nA U.S. Ether spot ETF has been nigh this summer after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 19b-4 filings of eight prospective issuers on the 23rd of May.\n\nStill, the ETF products are yet to be cleared to go live, pending approval of the S-1 registration statements.\n\nThe latest setback in the approval process has been laid at the door of the U.S. securities regulator. Last week, the SEC reviewed S-1 forms from issuers and requested resubmissions incorporating its comments by the 8th of July.\n\nConsequently, the timeline for the launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs has been pushed to mid-or end of July.\n\nMarket anticipation\n\nLast week, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra forecasted that Ether spot ETFs will see slightly lower demand when they go live, compared to Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, since they mostly share the same sources of demand.\n\nThe co-authors also cited \u201cthe lack of an ETH staking feature\u201d in the approved spot Ether ETFs as a deterrent that could dampen interest in the products.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have thus far attracted $55 billion since their introduction at the start of the year.\n\nThough inflows have waned from the February highs, analyst projections show that the figure is expected to eclipse $100 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nJ.P. Morgan, on the other hand, forecasted that Ether ETFs could see net inflows of about $3 billion ($6 billion if staking is permitted) by the end of the year.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nJ.P. Morgan also expected the market\u2019s immediate reception to be mildly negative, citing possible profit-taking by investors who bought the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) in expectation of its conversion to an ETF.\n\nSeparately, in the last week, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan projected that Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would draw in $15 billion of net inflows in the first dozen and a half months."

The amendments will take effect on July 5.\n\nThe company did not provide an exact reason for the delisting effort, reminding that it periodically reviews all listed spot trading pairs and removes some in case of poor liquidity or other factors.\n\nThe majority of the affected cryptocurrencies are in the red today (July 3). Their poor performance coincides with the sector\u2019s overall decline. According to CoinGecko\u2019s data, the global crypto market capitalization is currently standing at around $2.35 trillion, a 3.5% plunge compared to the figure observed the day before.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price retraced toward the $60K mark, while Ethereum (ETH) dipped to approximately $3,300.\n\nContrary to halting services for some existing trading pairs, Binance recently included some new ones in its platform. WIF/BRL, ZK/USDC, and ZRO/USDC were added to Binance Spot. It is worth noting that the service is not available to all clients:\n\n\u201cCurrently, users residing in the following countries or regions will not be able to trade the above-mentioned spot trading pair(s): Canada, Cuba, Crimea Region, Iran, Netherlands, North Korea, Syria, United States of America, and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands), and any non-government controlled areas of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPrevious Binance Announcements\n\nThe exchange has enforced numerous similar changes since the beginning of the year. Last month, it ceased trading services with the following pairs: ALPACA/BTC, NFP/TUSD, MDX/BTC, QUICK/BTC, and XAI/BNB.\n\nA few months before, Binance terminated all operations involving Monero (XMR). The move was followed by a price crash for the popular privacy coin."

        "title": "Hops on the Blockchain: How Ethereum Is Revolutionizing the Beer Industry - Washington Beer Blog",
        "content": "Image from pexels.com.\n\nFor many years, beer has been something that helps people relax and enjoy social events. It is also a sign of celebration and an important part of different cultures. However, how beer goes from the farm to your glass can be quite mysterious.\n\nMany people who love their favorite beers do not know much about where these drinks come from, how the ingredients are sourced, or what kind of effect making them has on the environment. This lack of clear information is becoming more and more worrisome for buyers, especially because craft beer is getting very popular nowadays.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum. It is the second-biggest blockchain platform globally and it can\u2019t be said for sure what will the Ethereum price prediction tomorrow will be. But one thing we know is that its ability to change the beer industry cannot be ignored. This new technology has great potential for changing how we keep records of beer, comprehend its history and relate with those who make it \u2013 all in a way that could greatly benefit this thriving sector.\n\nTransparency From Grain to Glass\n\nImagine picking up your favorite IPA and raising a glass, knowing exactly where every hop in that brew was grown \u2013 right down to the specific farm, their green methods and even when they were harvested. With Ethereum blockchain technology, this is possible now. Brewers can use this technology to note each step in making beer, starting from getting raw materials like hops and barley all the way to putting the finished beer into bottles.\n\nThis information is then kept safe on a digital ledger that nobody can alter, and anyone can see. People who buy the beer use simple apps to check this data, making sure where their beer came from and how good it is. This openness builds trust between brewers and customers, allowing the customers to make smart buying choices that match their values.\n\nA Toast to Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability\n\nMany consumers now want to support businesses that are ethical and have sustainable practices. Blockchain can be very useful for making sure there is transparency in these aspects. Breweries dedicated to using organic ingredients can place this data on the blockchain, giving consumers verifiable evidence.\n\nAdditionally, this technology has the ability to track the carbon footprint of beer throughout the whole supply chain. This helps breweries find places where they can do better and do less harm to the environment. Picture a world where lovers of craft beer can pick their favorite drink, knowing it was made with little harm to the environment \u2013 making both their taste buds and the planet happy.\n\nStreamlining Distribution: Smart Contracts for a Smoother Brew\n\nIn the beer distribution world, there is a complicated web of breweries, distributors and retailers. These parties often face inefficiencies such as errors in orders or invoices due to miscommunication between them.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts can solve this issue by automating tasks like ordering from the brewery, creating an invoice for the distributor and making payment \u2013 all executed without any need for human intervention. This not only cuts down on administrative expenses but also gets rid of mistakes and hold-ups linked to conventional ways.\n\nConsider a situation in which a distributor automatically places an order for more of a well-liked IPA from a brewery whenever the inventory levels decrease, all because of a smart contract. This method greatly enhances efficiency for each participant involved \u2013 starting with the brewer up to the distributor and eventually ending at the consumer who receives their preferred beer more swiftly.\n\nCraft Beer Goes Global\n\nFor craft breweries, the main problem they encounter in exporting their beers is the complicated regulations and huge amount of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help with this by creating an easy-to-use system for international trade that guarantees safety and prevents any changes to documents or transactions.\n\nFor small breweries, this might be a game-changer. They can make use of it to enter new markets and distribute their special brews all over the world. Picture a dedicated craft brewer in Seattle smoothly exporting their IPA that won awards to a beer festival in Europe, with blockchain dealing with all required paperwork without any issues.\n\nBig Beer Embraces Blockchain\n\nThe craft beer market is perfect for blockchain, yet big players are also becoming interested. In 2018, it was said that Anheuser-Busch InBev \u2013 the biggest brewer globally \u2013 utilized Ethereum to monitor advertising details about its Budweiser brand. This shows how blockchain can be beneficial even for the largest businesses in this industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a company to last for the next 100 plus years and that can only be done by disrupting existing paradigms through innovation and putting consumers at the heart of everything we do,\u201d said Lucas Herscovici, AB InBev\u2019s Global Marketing Vice President of Consumer Connections, Insights and Innovation.\n\n\u201cWhen we started digging into the potential of blockchain, we began to realize that if Kiip was started today, it would be built on blockchain technology,\u201d said Brian Wong, founder and CEO of Kiip, a leading ad tech and data platform powering mobile advertising. \u201cBlockchain\u2019s magical impact comes in the form of its immutable and decentralized ledger technology. Data that is stored uniquely in thousands of servers can never be manipulated. We saw this technology\u2019s potential to impact several major areas of the advertising world, including supply-chain transparency, campaign data reconciliation and viewability verification. Single Ledger, quite frankly, is just the beginning for us.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Budweiser\u2019s move to purchase the domain name \u201cBeer.eth\u201d for 30 ETH (around $81,000 at the time) and an NFT art piece for 8 ETH (around $21,000) further highlights the growing interest in blockchain within the beer industry.\n\nBrewing a Brighter Future\n\nWhile blockchain technology gives exciting possibilities, there are issues to think about before it can be used everywhere. One main problem is scalability \u2013 for example, the Ethereum network sometimes gets crowded and this might make transaction processing slower.\n\nGovernments must solve complex regulatory challenges as they figure out how to fit blockchain technology into current legal systems. And also, it is very important that consumers learn about this technology. Many people still do not know much about blockchain, so brewers must find good methods to explain the advantages of this technology.\n\nA Toast to Innovation\n\nEven with these difficulties, the possible advantages of blockchain for the beer industry are clear. By making things transparent, encouraging honest sourcing and improving the distribution process, blockchain can give more power to both brewers and people who buy beer.\n\nAs technology becomes better and these problems are solved, we can see even more new uses coming up. The future of beer appears very promising, with the addition of blockchain making things clearer, smoother and more fun for all people taking part in it.\n\nImagine a future where breweries can make interactive experiences on the blockchain. This way, people can go on virtual tours of hop farms or join special beer releases with safe token ownership. The chances for fun and new ideas are really without limit.\n\nDedicated to working together, creating new ideas and learning continuously, blockchain technology can change the beer industry greatly. This will make everything more connected, eco-friendly and enjoyable for everyone involved \u2013 from the enthusiastic brewers making the beer to those who truly appreciate drinking it.\n\nSo, next time you open a chilled drink, take a short moment to think about the journey it made to be there. Maybe with blockchain technology, someday you\u2019ll even track that path yourself\u2014from \u201chops on the blockchain\u201d to delightful sips."

        "content": "Bitcoin price encounters resistance around the $64,000 daily resistance level.\n\nEthereum price experiences rejection as it meets the descending trendline around the $3,500 level.\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.500, its daily resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) faces resistance near the $64,000 daily level, leading to a 1.05% decline in trading on Wednesday. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) similarly encounter resistance, resulting in 1% and 0.5% declines, respectively.\n\nBitcoin price finds hurdle around the $64,000 level\n\nBitcoin price was rejected by the daily resistance level at $63,956 on Monday and trades down 1.05% at $61,488 on Wednesday.\n\nIf BTC's price closes above the hurdle at the $63,956 daily resistance level, it could rise 5% to retest its next weekly resistance at $67,147.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are below their neutral levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed returning, then both momentum indicators must regain their positions above their respective neutral levels.\n\nIf the bulls are aggressive and the overall crypto market outlook is positive, BTC could extend an additional rally of 6% to revisit its weekly resistance at $71,280.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC closes below the $58,375 level and forms a lower low in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bearish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 3% decline in Bitcoin's price, to revisit its low of $56,522 from May 1.\n\nEthereum price experiences rejection by the descending trendline\n\nEthereum price was rejected by the descending trendline on Monday and is now 1% lower on Wednesday, reaching $3,386. This descending trendline is drawn from joining multiple swing highs from June 9 to July 1.\n\nIf ETH breaks above the descending trendline around the $3,500 level, it could rise 5.5% from the breakout point to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are below their neutral levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed returning, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective neutral levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, the high of June 9, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick closes below the $3,240 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 12% crash to the previous support level of $2,862.\n\nRipple price struggles at the $0.50 level\n\nRipple price currently trades at $0.483, below the daily resistance level of $0.50.If Ripple's price surpasses the barrier at $0.50, it could rise 7% from $0.50 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nIn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 mark, indicating neutral to bearish sentiment, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains below zero, suggesting bearish momentum. Both indicators must rise above their critical thresholds of 50 for RSI and zero for AO for a sustained bullish trend. Such a development would bolster the ongoing recovery rally in the market.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nConversely, if Ripple price daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, it would invalidate the bullish outlook by establishing a lower low on the daily chart. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

        "content": "Heading into July, the primary concern within the crypto community centers around the anticipated launch date of the spot Ethereum ETF for trading. According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, Ethereum ETFs are expected to become available for trading as early as July 15th.\n\nGeraci stated that with the revised S-1 submission for Ethereum ETFs to happen in July, the final S-1 approval from the SEC could arrive around July 12. Thus, July 15, Monday, would be the most probable day to begin trading Ether ETFs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th. Potential final S-1s by July 12th. Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th. via @emily_graffeo @olgakharif pic.twitter.com/NG8xhtCP21 \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2024\n\nIssuers to Address SEC Query On Spot Ethereum ETF\n\nLast Friday, the US SEC returned the S-1 filings to issuers to address some minor questions. Sources familiar with the matter stated that the issuers have been already working on it. As we know, in May, the SEC approved the 19b-4 filings to list the Ether ETFs on exchanges. However, they can only go live for trading after the SEC approves the S-1 submissions.\n\nSteve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, expected the Ether ETF approval in the next couple of weeks. Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, July 2, Kurtz said:\n\n\u201cThis is window-dressing, the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now. We did it for the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2014 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nNow the bigger question in everyone\u2019s mind is will the Ether ETF prove to be a strong catalyst to drive the crypto market higher?\n\nAlso Read: Why Are Ethereum Institutional Products Depleting Before ETF Launch?\n\nEthereum to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nOn Tuesday, K33 Research published a report stating that Ethereum would be outperforming Bitcoin post the ETF approval. As per K33, the launch of Ether ETfs would absorb nearly 0.75% to 1% of all ETH in circulation within the initial five months. This expectation is in line with that of Gemini which predicted $5 billion inflows within the first six months of launch. K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said:\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\u201d\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched, reaching 0.046 by May 24. However, unexpected news that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs boosted the ratio back up to 0.055.\n\nAlso Read: ETH/BTC Price Prediction: ETF Hype, FOMO and Ethereum Price Imminent Rally To $5,000\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "K33 Research says that Ethereum spot ETFs will accrue up to 1% of the Ether supply, or $4 billion, pushing ETH to outperform Bitcoin, which faces selling pressure as Mt. Gox creditors get refunded.\n\nThe firm says that ETH is trading at a steep discount against BTC but noted that Ether\u2019s futures interest was soaring, indicating that traders are accruing the altcoin on high leverage.\n\nK33 Research says Ethereum spot ETFs will change the game for the largest altcoin, making it a better investment than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Norwegian analytics company, formerly Arcane Research, says that most investors don\u2019t realize Ether\u2019s vast opportunity. This is reflected in its continued suppressed price, even as the green light for the launch of the ETH ETFs edges closer.\n\nThe company believes that once the ETFs launch, they will quickly rack up around 1% of all circulating Ethereum, equating to 1.2 million ETH, or $3.86 billion. It stated:\n\nWe maintain a bullish ETH outlook in anticipation of net inflows equivalent to 0.75-1% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in the five months following the launch.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 #Ethereum (ETH) set to outshine #Bitcoin (BTC) post-ETF launch! \ud83d\udcb9 K33 Research: 'We maintain a bullish ETH outlook in anticipation of net inflows equivalent to 0.75-1% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in the five months following the launch.'

As Crypto News Flash reported, some, like ETF Store President Nate Geraci and Consensys\u2019 Jimmy Ragosa, believe the approval will be in mid-July. Others believe it\u2019s towards the end of the month, while a few others believe the SEC\u2019s move to return the applications with its comments will lengthen the application process beyond July.\n\nAll analysts concur that these products will forever change Ethereum regardless of the timeline. American exchange and custodian says they will rack up $5 billion in the first six months, while K33 Research has a slightly more conservative estimate at $3.86 billion.\n\nThe firm said:\n\nETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\n\nCan ETFs Push Ethereum Beyond $5,000?\n\nBitcoin ETFs launched in mid-January, and two months later, the top coin hit its all-time high just below $74,000, dragging the entire market with it. Ethereum soared to $4000 at the time.\n\nAnalysts believe that a similar effect will take place once ETH ETFs launch. However, according to K33, ETH might \u201cstumble immediately following the launch of the ETFs\u201d from the \u201csell the news\u201d phenomenon. However, they expect it to pick up pace immediately and, by the end of the year, hit new heights.\n\nK33 says it\u2019s surprised that more traders aren\u2019t accumulating ETH in anticipation of the coming surge. Year-to-date, the top altcoin has only gained 45%, around the same as BTC and lower than BNB and other lower-cap altcoins.\n\nHowever, those in the derivatives market are catching on. Data shows that ETH futures open interest has been surging \u201crelentlessly\u201d as more traders take on higher leverage to buy ETH in anticipation of the price rise.\n\nEthereum trades at $3,313 at press time, dipping 3.5% in the past day.\n\nRecommended for you:"

Revealed by the analytics platform IntoTheBlock, this data shows a significant increase in Ethereum reserves held by strong hands and reflects increased confidence in the longevity of the world\u2019s second-largest crypto. This massive retention of ETH could not only stabilize the market but also pave the way for major developments in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAn upward trend for long-term holders\n\nCurrently, about 78% of Ethereum\u2019s total supply is held by loyal investors who acquired their ETH more than a year ago. Recent data published by the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock reveals this.\n\nThis significant accumulation has accelerated in recent months, highlighting growing confidence in the long-term value of Ethereum. Long-term holders, less inclined to sell their assets, contribute to increased market stability by reducing selling pressure. This dynamic could also attract new investors looking to position themselves on an asset perceived as more stable and reliable.\n\nThis trend is a positive indicator for Ethereum, suggesting that many investors are betting on its future potential and prefer to hold onto their assets rather than sell them.\n\nThe divergence between Ethereum and Bitcoin\n\nUnlike Ethereum, where long-term holders are increasing their grip on the supply, Bitcoin is experiencing an opposite dynamic. Since the beginning of the year, long-term Bitcoin investors have reduced their exposure, selling a significant portion of their assets. In May, they liquidated about 160,000 BTC, representing a value of $10.1 billion. Although this rate slowed in June, the phenomenon remains notable.\n\nThis divergence between the two main cryptos highlights different market strategies and perceptions. Ethereum holders seem to be betting on long-term stability and valuation, while Bitcoin holders choose to capitalize on current gains.\n\nIn summary, the increased retention of Ethereum by long-term holders could mark a turning point in the history of this crypto, positioning it as a safe haven in an often unpredictable market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum, following the performance of Bitcoin, is in red on the last trading day. ETH is bearish, at least from a technical perspective, but bullish from a fundamental standpoint. This position will only change if there is a convincing close above local resistance levels, the first being $3,700. Gains of June 29 and 30 were welcomed, but for this trend to evolve, there must be confirmations; this is missing at press time.\n\nPresently, Ethereum is in red, sliding nearly 15% from May highs. Though traders are upbeat and expecting gains, movements are tight in the daily chart. So far, Ethereum is down 3% in the past day and relatively stable in the last week of trading. Meanwhile, the average trading volume remains low, at just over $10.8 billion.\n\nTraders are closely watching the following trending Ethereum news:\n\nUniswap, one of the leading DeFi protocols on Ethereum, will be releasing the Uniswap extension in the coming week. More people will engage with the mainnet through this tool, driving up demand for ETH.\n\nConsenSys, the developer of MetaMask \u2014a non-custodial wallet, has been charged by the United States SEC for allegedly enabling the trading of unregistered securities. At the same time, the development company has been sued for facilitating the staking of ETH without registration.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nThough the crypto and the broader Ethereum community are watching out for the United States SEC to approve the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs, price action remains muted for now.\n\nETH/USD is under pressure, looking at price action in the daily chart.\n\nAccordingly, traders may choose to short on every high below $3,700, targeting $3,300 in the short term.\n\nEven so, in light of the spot Ethereum ETF expectations, long-term traders might choose to buy and HODL. This preview is valid as long as prices trend above $3,300.\n\nAny decisive close below this level will invalidate the general bullish preview, permitting ETH sellers to push, angling for $2,800.\n\nThis position will be valid, especially if the bear breakout bar below June lows is with rising trading volume."

        "title": "Ethereum dApp volume jumps 92%, but ETH bulls need to be careful - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Activities related to NFT trading and staking ensured the rise in dApp activity.\n\nWhile new demand for ETH fell, withdrawals from exchanges jumped.\n\nEthereum [ETH] stood out from the many blockchains available after its dApp volume increased by 92.43% in the last seven days. For context, dApp stands for decentralized Applications.\n\nThey are applications that operate on a blockchain network while using smart contracts to power trading and user interaction. In most cases, low transaction fees bring about a surge in volume.\n\nEthereum beats BNB Chain, others to the spot\n\nThis is because users do not have to pay exorbitant fees to facilitate the exchange of tokens or transfers. However, during Ethereum\u2019s era of high transactions fees, there were time it outperformed other chains in this regard.\n\nBut this time, the dominance could be linked to the cheap gas fees enabled by the Dencun upgrade which took place in March. At press time, Ethereum\u2019s dApp volume was $71.13 billion.\n\nThis value was much higher than BNB Chain, Polygon [MATIC], and the Tron [TRX]. However, one thing AMBCrypto noticed was that it was not an all-round increase with the applications.\n\nFor example, dApps like Blur, EigenLayer and Uniswap [UNI] NFT Aggregator registered notable hikes. However, others including Uniswap V2 and V3 could not match up as they noted declines.\n\nThis data suggested that there was a lot of NFT trading and staking that impacted the rise in volume. But trading of tokens on the blockchain were nowhere near those heights.\n\nTherefore, it was not surprising that there was a notable decrease in the network\u2019s UAW. This is an acronym for Unique Active Wallet. It is a term used to measure user engagement and activity.\n\nIf it increases, it means that user activity is high. But a decrease suggests a fall in active transactions, and that was the case with Ethereum.\n\nETH caught in between two sides\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s price changed hands at $3,365 which was a 2.32% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs it stands, the price of ETH might continue to experience a decrease or trade sideways despite optimism that the token would perform well this month.\n\nOne reason for this prediction is Ethereum\u2019s Network Growth. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis, the blockchain\u2019s Network Growth was down to 23,300.\n\nThis metric measures the number of new addresses making their first successful transaction.\n\nIf the number increases, then the blockchain is getting good traction. However, a decrease implies that adoption is low, which seems to be the case with ETH.\n\nHistorically, when Network Growth rises, it does not take long for ETH\u2019s price to jump. The opposite happens when the number of new addresses fall.\n\nAs mentioned before, it is possible to sell ETH drop from $3,300 in the short term.\n\nDespite the bearish outlook in the short term, the long-term looks promising for ETH. This was because of the Exchange Net Position Change on Ethereum.\n\nThis metric tracks the 30-day supply of cryptocurrencies held in exchange wallets.\n\nWhen it increases, it means deposits on exchanges are rising, increasing the likelihood of sell-offs. However, a decrease means withdrawals, and tilts toward fewer selling pressure.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ETH holders have been removing their assets from exchanges for some months. If this continues, it could provide stability for ETH\u2019s price.\n\nSo, ETH could target hitting $4,000 this quarter or surpassing its all-time high."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s netflow from exchanges increased by over 6%.\n\nETH has remained below its resistance level.\n\nOver the past month, Ethereum [ETH] has experienced a notable trend of outflows from exchanges. It indicated that investors were moving their holdings away from trading platforms.\n\nDespite the reduction in exchange balances, the volume of ETH being staked has continued to grow. ETH has been endeavoring to stabilize its price amid these shifts in investor behavior and network participation.\n\nEthereum increase monthly outflow\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum\u2019s transaction data revealed a significant net outflow from exchanges. The data showed that over 1 million ETH moved out of trading platforms in June.\n\nThis outflow, valued at approximately $3.8 billion, marked a considerable 6.4% month-over-month change. It indicated a substantial reduction in the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges.\n\nFurther examination of the exchange reserve data from CryptoQuant highlighted the magnitude of this shift. At the beginning of June, the total ETH held in exchange reserves was over 17 million.\n\nBy the end of the month, this figure had decreased to around 16 million ETH. As of this writing, the reserve was around 16.6 million ETH.\n\nThis decline in exchange reserves typically suggests a couple of strategic movements by investors.\n\nIt is either an increase in long-term holding, as investors withdraw ETH to secure wallets, or a move to engage more actively in the Ethereum staking process.\n\nThis is especially true with the ongoing development towards Ethereum 2.0. Both scenarios imply a bullish sentiment among holders.\n\nTotal Ethereum staked increases\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s staking activity offers insightful trends into the behavior of its holders, particularly with the decreasing balances on exchanges.\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, there has been a consistent increase in the total number of deposits. This indicated that more holders were opting to stake their ETH.\n\nThis activity is significant as it suggests a shift from trading or holding Ethereum on exchanges to securing it in staking contracts. According to the latest data, the number of deposits has surpassed 1.5 million.\n\nFurther reinforcing this trend, data from Dune Analytics revealed that over 33.2 million ETH have been staked. This substantial volume of staked ETH accounts for almost 28% of the total ETH supply.\n\nOverall, the increased staking activity and the corresponding decline in exchange-held ETH underscore a strategic shift among holders toward long-term investment.\n\nETH finding resistance\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Ethereum on a daily time frame chart indicated a shift in its market dynamics, with the price recently falling below its short moving average (yellow line).\n\nThis moving average, which previously acted as a support, is now functioning as a resistance level due to the recent price decline.\n\nThis reversal from support to resistance is a common technical pattern that suggests a change in market sentiment, where the price level that once bolstered buying interest now poses a barrier to upward movements.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum was trading at around $3,430, experiencing a slight decline of less than 1%.\n\nThe immediate resistance defined by the short moving average is currently positioned in the range of $3,500 to $3,600."

        "title": "Bitcoin Sentiment Hits Lowest Level In 18 Months, Ethereum Token Rollblock Continues To Gain Momentum As Price Set To Increase Again - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "A lot has happened in the crypto community since the last bull market. After Bitcoin had its long-awaited halving event, many altcoins saw a significant rise in value. This all-time high rippled across the industry, as institutional investors began to secure their positions. With spot ETFs now inevitable, and a lot more profit to be made, it\u2019s no surprise that more innovative assets are sweeping the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum-based Rollblock continues to gain massive traction in the iGambling and GameFi industry. The unique online casino has shown promise with its presale activity and is certain of monumentally positive price movements. Here\u2019s why you should invest:\n\nDespite Halving and ETF Approval, Bitcoin Craze Starts To Dwindle.\n\nBitcoin had started the year with the promise of massive gains and price appreciation. The pioneer cryptocurrency has faced recent difficulty in upping its price action as sentiments around the asset hit its lowest since the start of the new year.\n\nWith a halving event in April and the approval of spot ETFs, Bitcoin investors were certain of a radical surge northwards. Many months later, this has not been the case, as the bull market has not sustained significantly.\n\nThis has not deterred crypto investors, as transaction data shows a low selloff rate, with institutional investors holding their position. With the success of the Bitcoin spot ETF trades, many financial authorities have acknowledged Bitcoin as an institutional investment, capitalizing on the security and profitability of the asset.\n\nThe current trend is consistent with retrospective analysis of Bitcoin price movements over time. Many analysts have noted a constant dip in Bitcoin price around June, with a corresponding rebound as July rolls around. Bitcoin could yet recover from the slump, and investors are hopeful that the data rings true, as Ethereum ETF trades are set to launch in July.\n\nMeanwhile, many Bitcoin investors are looking to other viable profit options, and with Rollblock\u2019s presale currently ongoing, a unique opportunity has presented itself.\n\nRollblock Price Climbs Even Higher As Market Demand Increases In Presale Phase\n\nNew crypto assets hardly generate the level of demand required to drive up presale prices. With the steady increase in Rollblock\u2019s presale price, it is evident that the market is itching for this new asset. With new projects, investors primarily seek out utility, community engagement, and profit potential.\n\nRollblock has caught investors\u2019 attention with its unique and lucrative online casino platform. This platform aims to combine traditional centralized gambling with the transparency and profitability of Blockchain technology. The result is a DeFi platform that upholds security, privacy, and profitability.\n\nInvestors in Rollblock stand to gain mouthwatering rewards and bonuses provided by the ecosystem. Users can play games and trade to earn RBLK tokens. Presale investors are at a vantage point, as weekly revenue generated by the platform is shared amongst holders. Rollblock also offers staking options, allowing users the opportunity to expand the protocol\u2019s liquidity pool. Staking rewards reach as high as 30% APY.\n\nRollblock understands the economics of cryptocurrency and has committed to a deflationary supply system. This would reduce the amount of RBLK tokens in circulation over time. The platform aims to achieve this through its buyback program. RBLK tokens would be periodically purchased in decentralized exchanges using a share of Rollblock\u2019s weekly profits. The purchased RBLK tokens would then be split equally between token holders and the network\u2019s burn pool.\n\nMoreover, Rollblock is currently in the third stage of its public presale, with tokens selling out fast due to robust demand. Already, the emerging project has sold more than 50% of its stage 3 presale allocation, with RBLK tokens going for a discounted price of $0.015. With these benefits, Rollblock has defined itself as the future of online gambling, promoting user privacy, asset security, and massive profitability.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin sentiment has reached its lowest level in over a year as its price struggles to make significant gains. Meanwhile, the Ethereum-based token Rollblock is experiencing strong momentum during its presale phase, with increasing demand driving its price up.\n\nThe integration of Blockchain technology is expected to significantly increase the current market valuation of the gambling industry, making Rollblock an appealing choice for investors seeking to capitalize on this profit opportunity.\n\nAs the project approaches its official launch, many crypto analysts are confident that its price will increase by more than 800%.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://presale.rollblock.io/\n\n\n\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/rollblockcasino"

        "content": "Because the delay was unexpected, it raised uncertainty about the actual date that the Ethereum ETFs will be launched. Interestingly, some market experts began to think that if Ethereum ETFs are launched, they might not be as attractive as their Bitcoin counterparts, which have already made their mark in the market. Despite ETH being up by 2.1% on the daily chart, this development has caused many large-scale investors to dump Ethereum for now, and search for a better alternative cryptocurrency investment."

        "content": "The first half of 2024 has been marked by a surge in major hacks within the cryptocurrency space. Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and XRP have led the crypto scam losses amounting more than $1.5 billion. This year, over 200 significant incidents have resulted in approximately $1.56 billion in losses.\n\nCrypto Scam Losses Hit $1.5B\n\nAccording to Peck Shield Alert data, only $319 million of lost crypto funds have been recovered. Moreover, the losses this year represent a staggering 293% increase compared to the same period in 2023, where losses amounted to $480 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFurthermore, DeFi protocols have been the primary targets for hackers. They account for 59% of the total stolen value. Over 20 public chains experienced major hacks during this period. Moreover, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP topped the list for the amount lost via crypto hacks.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most frequently targeted, each accounting for 31.3% of the total hacks. Meanwhile, Arbitrum followed with 12.5% of the attacks. One of the most significant incidents occurred on June 3, 2024.\n\nDMM Bitcoin, a major Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, reported a substantial breach. The attackers stole 4,502.9 BTC, worth over $300 million at the time. This incident highlighted vulnerabilities within exchanges, especially those handling large volumes of digital assets.\n\nAlso Read: XRP News: Whale Shifts 63M Coins As Ripple Strengthens Case\n\nMajor XRP, ETH, BTC Hacks\n\nA week after the DMM Bitcoin attack, on June 10, UwU Lend, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, was compromised. The breach led to a loss of approximately $19.3 million in digital assets. This hack underscores the ongoing risks associated with DeFi platforms, which often operate with less regulatory oversight. The platform then offered $5 million reward for catching the hacker.\n\nEarlier in the year, on February 3, 2024, Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, confirmed a major security breach involving his personal wallets. Initially, there were rumors that Ripple itself was targeted. However, Larsen clarified that the hack involved his digital wallets and not Ripple\u2019s corporate assets.\n\nThe hackers managed to transfer a whopping 213 million XRP tokens, valued at approximately$112.5 million. Moreover, on-chain detective ZachXBT first alerted the community to the suspicious transactions. In response to the theft, Larsen and various crypto exchanges took swift action to mitigate the impact.\n\nMultiple exchanges, including MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, and HitBTC, collaborated to freeze a significant portion of the stolen funds. Binance alone froze $4.2 million worth of XRP to aid the investigation.\n\nMoreover, on April 2, 2024, FixedFloat, a Bitcoin Lightning-based exchange, experienced a security breach. Unauthorized transactions led to financial losses exceeding $3 million. This incident highlighted recurring security issues for FixedFloat, following a similar breach earlier in the year.\n\nThe company also faced significant challenges in securing its platform against repeated attacks. Moreover, in February, hackers stole $26 million worth of Ethereum and Bitcoin from FixedFloat. These digital assets were then dumped to exchanges to realize profits.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Leads Bitcoin By 2x In Network Fee Revenue, Thanks to Layer-2s\n\nKritika Mehta Kritika boasts over 2 years of experience in the financial news sector.

        "content": "A crypto whale, active since Ethereum\u2019s 2015 ICO, recently transferred 7,000 ETH valued at US$24 million.\n\nInitially, the whale purchased 254,900 ETH for just US$79,200, achieving an extraordinary 1,115,600% return due to a 76% price increase last year.\n\nETH is expected to see substantial future inflows with the anticipated ETF approvals.\n\nWhat a rare sighting. Yes, whale alerts aren\u2019t unusual in crypto, and sometimes it\u2019s just exchanges making a re-shuffle, but this is different.\n\nRelated: Supreme Court Ends Chevron Deference, Deals Blow to SEC\u2019s \u2018Crypto by Enforcement\u2019 Strategy\n\nA whale, which has been in the space since 2015 when ETH did its initial coin offering (ICO), has just moved 7,000 ETH worth US$24 million (AU$36.2 million). The whale \u2013 who probably wanted to cash in on the recent ETH price rally \u2013 still holds around 40,000 ETH.\n\nSource: Etherscan\n\nThe whale first purchased 254,900 ETH during the ICO for a total of just US$79,200 (AU$119,015). With the ETH price appreciating 76% in the past year alone, the investment led to a staggering return of 1,115,600% since the ICO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum ETFs Delayed, Yet Expected to See Large Inflows\n\nWith the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) around the corner, the price of ETH has further upside potential, analysts believe. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said in late June that $US15 billion (AU$22.5 billion) could flow into these funds.\n\nHowever, Hougan added that the inflows are not going to happen overnight. He expects it will take around 18 months to see such a sum move into the Ether funds.\n\nThe funds, initially expected in early July, have now been delayed, with a July 8 deadline for filings due, analysts believe we could see these funds trading in mid to late July.\n\nGermany, US Move More Crypto\n\nIn other whale-related news, two governments continue to move millions of crypto. As reported earlier, the German Government moved close to US$195 million (AU$292.8 million) in Bitcoin to exchanges, while the US transferred some US$241.22 million (AU$362.82 million).\n\nThe funds are part of a much larger stash of BTC seized from illegal activities.\n\nNow, both Germany and the United States are again actively transferring large amounts of Bitcoin, as data from Arkham Intelligence shows.\n\nGerman Government crypto holdings, source: Arkam Intelligence\n\nRelated: ATO Cracks Down: Crypto Profits Under Scrutiny as Aussies Lodge Tax Returns\n\nOn Monday, German government-associated wallets moved US$94.94 million (AU$ 142.64 million) worth of BTC, distributing 1,500 BTC across various accounts. This included 200 BTC to Bitstamp, 100 BTC to Coinbase, 100 BTC to Kraken, and 1,100 BTC to two unidentified wallets.\n\nThe US is also moving Bitcoin, echoing Germany\u2019s cryptocurrency activities."

        "content": "Short-term Analysis\n\nIn the short term, Ethereum price movement suggests a cautious outlook. The 1.71% decrease in the last 24 hours, coupled with a bearish MACD and a nearing oversold RSI, indicates that sellers currently dominate the market. However, the approach towards the first support level at US$3,347.7 could attract buyers, potentially stabilizing the price and providing a platform for recovery.\n\nMedium-term Analysis\n\nOver the medium term, the 1.05% decline over the past week reflects ongoing bearish sentiment. The support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining the next phase of price movement. If Ethereum holds above the first support level and manages to breach the first resistance level, it could signal a shift in momentum toward a more bullish outlook.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nThe overall market sentiment for Ethereum remains mixed. While the current technical indicators point to a bearish trend, the approaching support levels and near-oversold RSI suggest the potential for a rebound. Traders and investors should closely monitor these key levels and technical indicators to make informed decisions."

        "content": "Lido outperformed Ethereum in terms of fees earned in the last few days.\n\nDespite interest in staking growing, the price of ETH declined.\n\nLido [LDO] has managed to outperform Ethereum [ETH] in the last few days in terms of fees earned.\n\nLido showed growth\n\nIn the last month, Lido Finance collected $20.8 million in fees in just one week, which was higher than the fees collected by Ethereum itself, which collected $19.8 million during the same period.\n\nThis impressive performance placed Lido Finance as the second-highest fee earner within the cryptocurrency space for that week, behind only Tron [TRX], which had earned $33.7 million.\n\nLido Finance\u2019s momentum continued throughout the month. Over the entire month, Lido generated $98 million in fees, representing an 8% increase compared to the previous month.\n\nThis strong fee generation is likely due to Lido\u2019s dominance in the staked ETH market. At press time, Lido held over $33.4 billion in total staked assets, commanding a 29% market share in staked ETH.\n\nLido\u2019s total value locked (TVL) jumped 1.36% this week, reaching $33.48 billion. This surge was driven by a wave of new ETH staking deposits, with 95,616 net new ETH staked through Lido in the past seven days.\n\nWhile the 7-day stETH APR dipped slightly by 0.04% to 2.96%, there were positive signs elsewhere.\n\nWrapped stETH (wstETH) bridged to Layer 2 networks saw a significant rise of 7.19%, bringing the total to 141,586 wstETH.\n\nArbitrum [ARB] held the majority with 65,290 wstETH, followed by Optimism [OP] at 27,879 wstETH. Both networks experienced minor declines in the past week.\n\nThere was also a slight increase in wstETH deposited in lending pools and liquidity pools, reaching 2.70 million stETH and 83.5k stETH respectively.\n\nwstETH bridged to Cosmos networks also saw a small uptick, reaching 1,788 wstETH up 2.12% in the past week.\n\nHowever, the 7-day trading volume for (w)stETH dipped 7.25% compared to the previous week, totaling $1.23 billion.\n\nWhile Scroll saw a significant increase in wstETH up 86.26%, other networks like Base, Polygon, Linea, and zkSync Era experienced minor declines.\n\nWhat happens next for ETH?\n\nThe popularity and growth of the Lido protocol hints at the fact that users are increasingly showing their interest in staking ETH.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s LDO\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nEven though ETH\u2019s price may be stagnating at the time of writing, a surge in staking implies that existing users believe in the long-term potential of ETH.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,336.23 and its price had declined by 3.15% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "As the global financial markets prepare to launch U.S.-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ethereum is positioned to potentially outperform Bitcoin, according to a new analysis by K33 Research.\n\nThis comes amid concerns that Bitcoin might face downward pressure due to upcoming repayments to creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nETF Launch to Begin a New Era for Ethereum\n\nEthereum has lagged behind Bitcoin in performance over the last year, with the former surging 67% while the latter by 95%, but that might be about to change with the anticipated launch of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, expected in the coming weeks.\n\nAnalysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman from K33 Research suggest that introducing these spot ETFs could be pivotal for Ethereum\u2019s valuation.\n\nDespite a likely initial dip post-launch, they forecast that inflows into these funds will propel Ethereum\u2019s price over time, drawing a parallel to the earlier impact of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETFs, which attracted billions of dollars in inflow after launch.\n\nThis optimism is rooted in the belief that ETFs will catalyze significant capital flows into Ethereum, mirroring the influx seen with Bitcoin.\n\nThe analysts project net inflows amounting to 0.75% to 1% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply within five months post-launch, potentially setting the stage for substantial price appreciation. The analysts noted:\n\nETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\n\nWhen Will ETH Spot ETF Launch In The US?\n\nDespite the analysts\u2019 bullish outlook, the market appears skeptical, as evidenced by Ethereum futures trading at a discount relative to Bitcoin futures, as highlighted in the K33 Research.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nExperts Eye Spot Ethereum ETF Launch By Mid-July, Predict Price Rally 2 months ago\n\nEthereum is trading at around $3,312, reflecting a 3.3% drop over the past day and conceding with the ubiquitous decline in the crypto market.\n\nIn the broader context, the crypto industry is enthusiastic about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, highlighted that amended S-1 forms for Bitcoin ETFs are due before July 8, with approvals potentially finalized by July 12, paving the way for a mid-July launch.\n\nWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th. Potential final S-1s by July 12th. Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th. via @emily_graffeo @olgakharif pic.twitter.com/NG8xhtCP21 \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2024\n\nConcurrently, Steve Kurz from Galaxy Digital expressed confidence in a Bloomberg interview that Ethereum ETFs would receive approval within July, underscoring the structured and familiar regulatory process drawing from experiences with Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation has disclosed that withdrawals of ETH staked on the beacon chain to individual execution layer accounts will be available soon. It revealed this in a blog post on December 29 to its research team and customers.\n\nThe blog update also stated that the consensus layer core specs are \u201cnearing completion,\u201d revealing further that client teams are implementing and testing the withdrawal functionality.\n\nSince switching from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) in mid-September 2022, enabling the withdrawal functionality for stakeholders has been one of the most anticipated milestones on Ethereum\u2019s roadmap.\n\nSince its inception till date, over 15,766,262 ETH (worth over $18B) has been staked on the Beacon chain across 492,000 validators. Staking on Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain first went live on December 1, 2020, with investors ultimately locked in until whenever the Ethereum developer community finalized the withdrawal functionality. Even when the function goes live, Ethereum\u2019s roadmap suggests the withdrawal will be available to users over time rather than immediately.\n\nThe most recent update from the Ethereum Foundation notably does not include a definite timeline. However, it reassures investors that the functionality is a top priority and would likely go live in 2023.\n\nEthereum continues on long-path to scalability\n\nEthereum\u2019s migration to the PoS consensus mechanism earlier this year marked a significant step towards broader efforts to scale the network and improve security.\n\nIn a recent development, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared an updated roadmap on how Ethereum plans to reach mainstream-level capacity. The new roadmap notably includes a new \u201cThe Scourge\u201d phase during which Ethereum will solve a long-known bottleneck around miner extractable value (MEV) transactions.\n\nAt full scale, Ethereum developers envision the network handling over 100,000 transactions per second at significantly lower fees. However, that path could take at least a few more years to achieve, with the staking unlocking function the most imminent on the list of objectives."
