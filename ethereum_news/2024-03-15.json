        "content": "What Is the Ethereum Roadmap: Upgrades in 2024 and Beyond\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 The Ethereum network ensures constant progress through its roadmap, allowing it to improve the protocol while addressing new challenges and developments in crypto.\n\n\n\n\u2014 After the Merge and Shanghai upgrade, the Ethereum roadmap has been updated to make the network scalable, resilient, and more secure.\n\n\n\n\u2014 The next upgrade Ethereum will undergo is the Prague/Electra upgrade, which is not yet scheduled.\n\nAs the pioneering network for smart contracts, Ethereum has enabled an entire ecosystem to come to life. It is home to the majority of today\u2019s decentralized applications (dApps) and powers an entire sector of decentralized financial services that host tens of billions of dollars.\n\nSince its founding in 2015, Ethereum price has grown tremendously, winning the support of individuals, communities, and businesses across the globe. Still, the network has some growing to do before it can gain the acceptance of a mainstream audience.\n\nIndeed, for Ethereum to become accessible, affordable, and resilient enough to be adopted by the masses, there are several challenges that it must still overcome. And mapping out those challenges, and how the network might solve them, is precisely why the Ethereum roadmap exists.\n\nBut what exactly are the challenges facing Ethereum? And how will its planned upgrades help to prepare it for mass adoption? Let\u2019s explore what the future holds for the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat Is the Ethereum Roadmap For?\n\nFor all of Ethereum\u2019s success as a global coordination platform, it has some shortcomings. Most notably, the network suffers from slow transaction speeds and high fees during times of high congestion.\n\nThis is arguably Ethereum\u2019s biggest roadblock when it comes to onboarding more users. After all, if Ethereum actually reached something close to mainstream adoption in its current state, it would likely be unreasonably slow and expensive. This is, generally speaking, what people mean when they talk about the scalability of a blockchain. It\u2019s the idea that the network needs to be able to scale up and accommodate many more users while still functioning well.\n\nOf course, tackling Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges brings about what is known as the blockchain trilemma. This phrase was coined by Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, and refers to the concept that, while there are three key elements in a blockchain \u2013 decentralization, scalability, and security \u2013 you can only optimize for two of them. In other words, you can have a fully decentralized and highly secure blockchain, but it won\u2019t be scalable. And so on and so on.\n\nAs a result of this, Ethereum has to remain highly adaptable as it continues to address its challenges while pursuing an optimal balance of decentralization, scalability, and security. Not to mention that, with the hyper-innovative, constantly changing nature of crypto, Ethereum has to be able to integrate new features, assets, and applications as they appear.\n\nThere needs to be a way to keep track of all the upgrades that Ethereum needs, which is why the roadmap exists. It\u2019s essentially a list of all the specific changes necessary to make the network cheaper and easier to use, more secure, and futureproof.\n\nHow Are Ethereum Upgrades Decided On?\n\nAs a decentralized network and open-source network, Ethereum is not controlled by a single entity. The upgrades proposed in the roadmap generally come from Ethereum researchers and developers, but essentially anyone can offer suggestions to upgrade the protocol.\n\nBasically, any interested person can propose a change by creating an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), which outlines the technical specifications for the proposed changes. The community of Ethereum developers and researchers then reviews, debates, and potentially implements the EIP. It\u2019s important to note that EIPs generally grow out of discussions on major Ethereum forums or the EthR&D Discord that then mature into specific ideas for improvements.\n\nAnother key point about the roadmap is that it is subject to change. The points on the roadmap can evolve as new information, ideas, and technologies become available.\n\nFor example, the roadmap previously laid out plans to scale the network through sharding, a method that involves splitting up the blockchain so subsets of validators handle only a portion of the total data. This is no longer a part of the roadmap now as danksharding, which integrates \u2018blobs\u2019 of data into Ethereum blocks, has replaced the earlier proposed sharding approach.\n\nWhat Changes Are Coming to Ethereum?\n\nScalability\n\nAs previously mentioned, scalability is a major issue for Ethereum to address. Thus, the Ethereum roadmap features several planned upgrades to that end.\n\nDanksharding\n\nDanksharding is the current plan for making Ethereum transactions much cheaper and faster and it revolves around Layer 2 solutions, specifically blockchain rollups.\n\nTo sum up, Danksharding will enable the Ethereum network to process the bundled transactions that come from layer two roll ups without having to store all of their data permanently.\n\nSingle-Slot Finality\n\nCurrently, it takes about 15 minutes for an Ethereum block to finalize. The introduction of single-slot finality (SSF) aims to make the block validation process more efficient. Under the SSF mechanism, blocks can be proposed and finalized in the same slot, significantly decreasing the time it takes to finalize a block.\n\nVerkle Trees\n\nA blend of the two concepts \u201cVector commitment\u201d and \u201cMerkle Trees,\u201d Verkle trees serve as a data structure to upgrade nodes. Notably, Verkle Trees make it possible for Ethereum to use stateless clients. These stateless clients ultimately help scalability as they only need a tiny amount of storage space to be able to verify new blocks.\n\nUser Experience\n\nAs crypto gains mainstream adoption, blockchains must offer better UX design and customer experience to appeal to the non-technical masses. This is the key to bringing the technology to more users and advancing the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nThis need for an improved user experience is partly being addressed by a group of upgrades, collectively referred to as account abstraction. This class of upgrades will support smart contracts natively on Ethereum. Currently, smart contract interactions can only happen through externally owned accounts (EOAs).\n\nAccount abstraction will bring about many exciting features natively to Ethereum, such as the ability to batch transactions together, recover your account if you lose the keys, or have someone else pay for your gas.\n\nSecurity\n\nEvery day, attackers try to find new ways to exploit the Ethereum network and its users. Ethereum is exploring the following features to provide top-notch security and keep attackers at bay.\n\nProposer-Builder Separation (PBS)\n\nPBS splits the block-building and block-proposal tasks among different validators. For each slot, block builders create blocks and present them to the block proposer, who can then choose the most profitable block without seeing its contents. The proposer also has to pay a fee to the block builder before sending the block to its peers. This arrangement prevents transaction censorship, establishes a fairer consensus mechanism, and facilitates the Danksharding upgrade.\n\nClever Cryptography\n\nThe proof-of-stake (PoS) based consensus mechanism currently makes the list of upcoming block proposers public, making it possible to map their IP addresses. This makes them vulnerable to attacks such as a DOS attack. Clever cryptography here makes sure the identity of the current block proposer is not made public and protects them.\n\nWhere are we on the Ethereum Roadmap so far?\n\nOver the last nine years, Ethereum has gone through several upgrades to enhance its network, with the last two major upgrades being the Merge and Shanghai.\n\nWhat Was the Merge?\n\nActivated on Sept. 15, 2022, the Merge was a way to complete Ethereum\u2019s shift from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS), where validators are randomly selected based on the total amount and duration of their ETH staking.\n\nIn December 2020, developers launched the Beacon Chain as a basic PoS-based version running parallel to the regular Ethereum mainnet. They used it to test reconfigurations and new features safely.\n\nJust under two years later in September 2022, the integration of both the Beacon Chain and the mainnet marked Ethereum\u2019s official adoption of the PoS consensus mechanism across its ecosystem.\n\nWhat was the Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nAfter the Merge, the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade, also known as the Shapella upgrade, was a major step in finalizing Ethereum\u2019s move from PoW to PoS. While this planned hard fork of the protocol opened the door to new developments, it also unlocked the ability to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nUp until the Shanghai upgrade, those who staked their ETH on the Beacon Chain were unable to withdraw their locked-up ETH and the rewards earned in the process. However, following the Shanghai upgrade on April 12, 2023, validators could finally access their ETH holdings and cash out their rewards.\n\nWhat was the Dencun Upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade, one of the major upgrades, went live on March 13th. It\u2019s designed to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and enhance data availability on Ethereum. Notably, this upgrade introduces \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d, the first step to scaling the network through danksharding.\n\nProto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, introduced data \u201cblobs\u201d\u2014an acronym for \u2018Binary Large Objects.\u2019 These data blobs can be sent and attached to blocks, aiming to minimize the data stored permanently on Ethereum.\n\nCurrently, layer-2 scaling solution rollups post their transactions in CALLDATA, which is costly because their data remains on the chain indefinitely. In contrast, the data in blobs are automatically deleted after a fixed period, reducing data storage costs and thus lowering transaction fees for users.\n\nWhat\u2019s next on the Ethereum Roadmap?\n\nNow, the Ethereum network is preparing for more upgrades to advance its capabilities. Here\u2019s what\u2019s next in line for the blockchain:\n\nPrague/Electra Upgrade\n\nOnce implemented, the Dencun upgrade will allow developers to focus on the next update, the Prague/Electra upgrade (Pralectra). Interestingly, there is still a debate among core Ethereum devs about what Pralectra will entail.\n\nOn one hand, it could look like several smaller EIPs focused on adding new features to the network. For example, one of the major proposals for this upgrade is EIP-6110, which would improve Ethereum\u2019s security and stability by changing the way that the network processes its validators\u2019 deposits.\n\nOtherwise, Pralectra could end up being a major protocol upgrade that would add Verkle Trees to the blockchain\u2019s execution layer. As previously mentioned, Verkle Trees are an important milestone in the overall Ethereum roadmap, important for increasing its scalability.\n\nWhile the specific items that Prague/Electra will center on are still being decided, this upgrade will undoubtedly make further improvements to the network\u2019s performance, security, and usability.\n\nThe Future of Ethereum\n\nOver the past decade, cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary answer to the traditional financial world by offering a decentralized, permissionless, and secure alternative to traditional banking systems. In the same spirit, Ethereum has brought forth a wave of innovation in global decentralization. With its advanced technology, growing ecosystem, and constant evolution, the future of the pioneering smart contract chain is bright indeed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a future that you can be a part of! By getting yourself a Ledger Ethereum wallet, you unlock all that the Ethereum ecosystem has to offer, all while enjoying the power and security of self-custody.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Take your place at the forefront of the Ethereum evolution and explore the bleeding edge of innovation in the decentralized world."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs have been a runaway hit. Will we see an Ethereum ETF before long? - Fortune",
        "content": "Barely two months since their approval, spot Bitcoin ETFs have proved massively popular, with over $11.8 billion flowing into the so-called \u201cNewborn Nine,\u201d including a record $1 billion on Tuesday.\n\nLargely as a result, Bitcoin\u2019s price has shot up almost 60% this year, reaching an all-time high near $72,000, and Ether has climbed at roughly the same rate, to around $4,000. Part of the latter\u2019s gains may be attributed to anticipation over the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s final deadline to respond to the first spot Ether ETF application, issued by VanEck, on May 23.\n\nGiven the success of the new Bitcoin investment vehicles, how might the SEC rule on similar products tied to crypto\u2019s second-biggest blockchain, and what should markets expect? Well, it depends whom you ask.\n\n\u2018A pretty vanilla approval\u2019\n\nIn theory, an approval \u201cshould be easy,\u201d Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan told Fortune, as SEC Chair Gary Gensler approved spot Bitcoin ETFs after the existence of Bitcoin futures ETFs, and the latter already exist for Ether.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see a pretty vanilla approval, and if it\u2019s a denial, it would need to be some new reason that people can\u2019t think of,\u201d Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, told Fortune.\n\nBoth Spencer and Aurielle Barthere, a research analyst at Nansen, pointed out that big names could help soothe regulators\u2019 concerns as they did with Bitcoin. Someone like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink could help sway Gensler by citing his near-perfect ETF track record. \u201cThis is a very powerful man,\u201d added Spencer.\n\nSEC seeking public comments on various spot ether ETF filings\u2026\n\n\n\nReally comes down to this:\n\n\n\nShould approval of spot btc ETFs = approval of spot eth ETFs?\n\n\n\nGiven SEC allowed eth futures ETFs, I say yes.\n\n\n\nBut clearly key differences b/w btc & eth (which SEC circling in on here). pic.twitter.com/tSPezL1n3U \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) March 6, 2024\n\nBut while hopefuls point to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11 as precedent, others are convinced Ether\u2019s path could be more arduous: After all, it did take the SEC nearly a decade to come around on the spot Bitcoin vehicles.\n\nFor starters, some of the issuers, including Ark and Franklin Templeton, have contemplated staking Ether in their applications, which would be \u201ca significant complication,\u201d Hougan noted.\n\nStaking involves locking Ether tokens into the blockchain to help validate transactions and earn additional yields, part of a proof-of-stake mechanism. The latest reward rate is 4.17%, according to Staking Rewards. When a validator stakes tokens, it signifies a commitment to the network\u2019s security. But Gensler voiced concern last March that digital assets using staking protocols could be considered securities under federal law.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s concern ETF inflows would put more staked tokens in the hands of just a few providers. S&P Global analyst Andrew O\u2019Neill told Bloomberg last month this \u201ccould become large enough to change validator concentrations\u201d in the network, exposing it to operational risks associated with centralization, such as outages from a single point of failure or market manipulation.\n\nBTW, Ethereum is fundamentally incompatible with an ETF.\n\n\n\nProof of Stake Txn validation & coins held with a centralised custodian doesn't work.\n\n\n\nCoinbase would control the entire network.\n\n\n\nThe only reason to approve an ETH ETF is if the SEC wanted to destroy Ethereum \ud83e\udd37 \u2014 Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) February 18, 2024\n\nBut Hougan dismisses these fears: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d Indeed, staked Ether only represents a quarter of total coins, and while Bitcoin spot ETFs are booming, their assets under management are a drop in the ocean compared to the currency\u2019s market cap.\n\nMatteo Greco, a crypto analyst at Fineqia International, adds that the same argument could be applied to the 11 publicly traded U.S. Bitcoin miners that dominate the network\u2019s hashrate. He ultimately sees some level of centralization as a trade-off for the market reaching mainstream popularity: \u201cYou can\u2019t maintain full decentralization and reach billions of people.\u201d\n\n\u2018A major roadblock\u2019\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of Ether\u2019s legal status. While declaring more than a dozen other popular coins to be securities, the SEC has so far flip-flopped on Ether. In 2018, Gensler was filmed telling hedge funds it\u2019s not a security, but then avoided taking a position at a congressional hearing last year. That ambiguity could be \u201ca major roadblock\u201d that adds \u201ccomplexity\u201d to the process, notes Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex.\n\nAnother potential obstacle could be the relative youth of the Ether futures ETF\u2014October 2023 vs. April 2021\u2014compared with those for Bitcoin. Ether is also less liquid, Greco adds, and its market cap is only about one-third of Bitcoin\u2019s. More liquidity generally means less of a spread and more consumer protections\u2014if a futures market lacks liquidity, it could create a significant divergence between spot and futures prices.\n\nLastly, there is political pressure. Gensler may want to align with the anti-crypto stances of some elected officials\u2014or those seeking election\u2014instead of \u201crolling over,\u201d noted Jake Chervinsky, chief legal counsel at Variant Fund. And on Friday, in a letter from Sens. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) to Gensler, they called on the SEC to halt the approval of additional crypto ETFs, expressing concerns over smaller cryptocurrencies being susceptible to \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d schemes that could pose \u201cenormous risks\u201d for retail investors.\n\nIt brings me no joy to be an ETH ETF bear. I\u2019ve been working for Ethereum in one sense or another for 5+ years. I want the ETF to be approved. It should be.\n\n\n\nBut I\u2019m calling it like I see it, and I see an SEC that:\n\n\n\n(1) dislikes crypto as a concept, sees no value in the\u2026 \u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) March 11, 2024\n\nWhen will we know\u2014and what\u2019s next?\n\nSpencer predicts there\u2019s a 60% to 70% chance of a May approval. Nansen\u2019s Barthere agrees, adding it\u2019s \u201crather likely,\u201d citing the token\u2019s absence from recent SEC lawsuits against top exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBut while Hougan took a more cautious approach, he did say it\u2019s 75% likely to happen by year\u2019s end.\n\nChervinsky, on the other hand, says 2024 isn\u2019t likely for such an approval. The SEC doesn\u2019t appear to be working out the necessary details, and if the agency stays mostly quiet in the buildup to May 23, \u201cthat silence will speak volumes,\u201d he adds.\n\nIf approved, many experts predict Ether could shatter its all-time-high of $4,878, reached in November 2021, just as Bitcoin skyrocketed after the spot ETFs got a green light. But, Hougan notes, it\u2019s less likely inflows to Ether-based products will match their Bitcoin brethren.\n\n\u201cMany traditional investors just want exposure to crypto,\u201d he said, \u201cand it will take some time to differentiate between the different public blockchains.\u201d"

        "title": "It\u2019s cheaper to swap on layer-2s than on Ethereum, Uniswap research finds - Blockworks",
        "content": "A recent paper by Austin Adams, a researcher at Uniswap Labs, contends that swapping and liquidity provisions on layer-2 networks are significantly cheaper than on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\n\nAccording to the paper, chains like Arbitrum created over three times more liquidity positions this past year than Ethereum.\n\nThe report further shows that, when looking at USDC/ETH pools, 97.5% of swappers with trades under $125,000 did better on layer-2s than on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nRead more: Uniswap releases new tools for swappers\n\nThis is likely because retail swappers, with trades under $125,000, are much more likely to benefit from the lower gas costs and higher liquidity concentration on layer-2s than the mainnet.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ethereum is responsible for only around 25% of the total transaction count but over 60% of the volume \u2014 demonstrating that, despite boasting higher transaction volumes, network activity is still predominantly on layer-2s.\n\nAdditionally, layer-2s often offer shorter block times, or the time it takes the network to produce a new block. On Ethereum today, the average block time is roughly 12 seconds. On Arbitrum, on the other hand, the average block time is around 0.26 seconds.\n\nRead more: Cheatsheet: Ethereum on track to burn $10B ETH over next year\n\nThe shorter the block time, the less opportunity there would be for the market price of an asset to move, meaning that arbitrage attempts will likely not be as profitable.\n\nLess successful arbitrage attempts are a good thing for liquidity providers, who are making 20% more in returns from arbitrage on layer-2s than they are on mainnet, the paper shows.\n\nAlthough there are significant benefits for users to trade on layer-2s, the paper does note drawbacks. One primary concern is the centralized sequencer.\n\nRead more: \u2018Shared Sequencing\u2019 could help unite blockchain rollups\n\nThe paper notes that many existing rollups today still operate under one centralized sequencer. This sequencer could take advantage of the situation by reordering transactions to maximize MEV profits for themselves.\n\nAdditionally, optimistic rollups today do not have decentralized fraud proofs, which are necessary to correct sequencer errors.\n\nRead more: So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nFinally, there are over 40 layer-2 ecosystems present today. The proliferation of these networks means further liquidity fragmentation, as they cannot trustlessly speak to one another in real time. This means that they will need to rely on bridging infrastructure, which is both costly and time-consuming.\n\nThe developers of layer-2 networks are working to address these concerns. Optimism recently revealed a permissionless fault-proof system, while shared sequencer networks like Espresso have explored ways to diversify sequencers for rollups.\n\n\u201cFor decentralized markets to fulfill their full potential, aggregate trading costs must continue to decline and user experience must continue to improve,\u201d Adams wrote. \u201cWe believe that the studied generalized layer-2s still have many benefits that users can utilize today, and any future improvements will only continue to benefit the trading experience.\u201d\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ether Slips from Highs as Investors Lock in Profits After Upgrade\u2014Key Levels to Watch - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Ether was down more than 5% in early trading Friday morning as investors locked in profits following Ethereum's Dencun upgrade.\n\nInvestors are hoping the SEC will approve a spot Ether ETF application filed by BlackRock on May 23, though Bloomberg ETF analysts estimate the chances of an approval by that date at just 30%.\n\nThe Ether price may find support at the key 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci levels around $3,365 and $3,135.\n\n\n\nEther (ETH), the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain and second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, traded more than 5% lower early Friday morning, days after the network successfully completed its highly anticipated Dencun upgrade, indicating investors may have already factored in the news.\n\nThe enhancement, which aims to improve the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s cost-effectiveness, added to bullish sentiment surrounding Ether, helping propel the cryptocurrency through the $4,000 level earlier this week. \u201cDencun will change how Ethereum developers build smart contracts, leading to more secure and user-friendly applications,\" Richard Meissner, co-founder of Safe, told Cointelegraph in an email.\n\nIn addition to the Dencun upgrade, Ether has ridden tailwinds of ongoing record flows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing expectations that the cryptocurrency could soon have its own spot ETF. Investors are hoping that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve an Ether ETF application filed by asset manager BlackRock on May 23, though Bloomberg ETF analysts estimate the chances of an approval by that date at just 30%.\n\nThese recent bullish factors may already be baked into the cake. On Tuesday, Ether put options, a financial instrument that protects holdings in the cryptocurrency from potential price downturns, traded at a premium to Ether call options expiring over the next 30 and 60 days. Singapore-based digital assets trading firm QCP Capital said this shift in sentiment, combined with high levels of leverage in the market, may lead to a correction, but that it expects dips to be short-lived.\n\nEther started its current bull run in late October last year, with the uptrend gaining further momentum when the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average just over a month later to form a bullish golden cross chart pattern. Gains accelerated throughout February and early March before the price ran into resistance earlier this week just above the closely watched $4,000 level. Amid ongoing selling pressure, monitor key Fibonacci retracement levels as potential areas of support. Currently, the 38.2% Fib level sits around $3,365, while the 50% Fib level lines up with the $3,135 region.\n\nEther was at $3,665 at around 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

They maintain the history of the chain and run the consensus protocol that makes it possible to implement complex decentralized applications\u2014from decentralized finance applications to NFT collectibles. To join the protocol, validators provide assets as collateral, which ensures they behave correctly in driving consensus. Unfortunately, because the protocol doesn\u2019t distinguish between malicious validators and honest mistakes, operational mistakes and bugs in validator client software have and continue to put assets at risk. This results in small economic penalties in the best case scenario and total loss of funds in the worst case.\n\nIn this post, we describe the high-level architecture of a secure key management platform designed to protect Ethereum validator operators from insider threats, validator compromise, operational mistakes, and client bugs. We cover the following topics:\n\nThe challenges of running Ethereum validators and the associated security and slashing risks.\n\nThe idea of tackling these challenges using a remote key management solution and the underlying goals a key manager must be built around to meaningfully reduce risk.\n\nThe high-level design of Cubist\u2019s CubeSigner, a secure key management platform built on top of AWS Nitro Enclaves. CubeSigner supports staking and other applications, from end-user wallets to trading to key management for teams and operations.\n\nOperational traps and pitfalls when running Ethereum validators\n\nThe Ethereum PoS protocol is a consensus protocol run across hundreds of thousands of validators. Every few seconds, validators run Ethereum transactions and, if the results of running these transactions agree with state changes proposed by a randomly chosen validator, they add these transactions to the blockchain and attest to this by signing validation messages. To incentivize validators to honestly report the state of the chain, the protocol requires them to put 32 ETH at stake. If validators behave as expected, (for example, by not manipulating transactions or lying about the state of the chain), they earn a reward on their staked assets. If they don\u2019t, they lose some of this stake.\n\nIf validators are caught manipulating the state of the chain, they are penalized for putting the network\u2019s safety at risk through slashing. Getting slashed means losing a significant amount of stake and being ejected from the protocol. To a lesser degree, validators are also punished if they go offline or sign very slowly, because this puts the protocol\u2019s availability at risk.\n\nUnfortunately, validator mistakes are indistinguishable from malicious behavior. If a validator provides two conflicting reports on the state of the blockchain, it\u2019s impossible to tell if the conflict resulted from intentional misbehavior or a bug in the validator software. As a result, operators who make security, correctness, or performance mistakes can suffer direct financial loss due to slashing. There are serious challenges in preventing each kind of mistake:\n\nSecurity \u2013 A single validator staking key typically protects 32 ETH (at the time of writing, roughly $80,000 USD). However, these valuable validator staking keys can\u2019t be kept in cold storage because they must sign validation messages every few minutes. As a consequence, node operators have to protect hot keys from system breaches. This is especially hard considering the complex environment of open source validator clients, the operational requirements to keep nodes alive 24/7, and the potential of insider threat vectors like rogue operators and social engineering. Our goal \u2013 Create a key manager that prevents attackers or malicious insiders from stealing or misusing secret signing keys.\n\n\u2013 A single validator staking key typically protects 32 ETH (at the time of writing, roughly $80,000 USD).

Correctness \u2013 Validators that sign two different, conflicting messages are deemed dishonest and are slashed, even if the conflicting signatures were a genuine mistake. In the past, honest operators have been slashed because of buggy validator client software, errors migrating validators across machines, and mistakes updating validator software.

Availability \u2013 Validators that don\u2019t sign or sign too slowly (for example, don\u2019t respond with the 12-second slot time) get reduced financial rewards or don\u2019t get paid at all. As a result, node operators design their solutions to be highly available and reliable, and to respond with low latency (typically setting an upper bound of 500 milliseconds for signing). Our goal \u2013 Create a key manager that helps operators achieve these latency, reliability, and availability goals.\n\n\u2013 Validators that don\u2019t sign or sign too slowly (for example, don\u2019t respond with the 12-second slot time) get reduced financial rewards or don\u2019t get paid at all. As a result, node operators design their solutions to be highly available and reliable, and to respond with low latency (typically setting an upper bound of 500 milliseconds for signing).\n\nRemote signing reduces risk due to bugs and operational mistakes\n\nTo participate in the Ethereum PoS Beacon chain, node operators use a validator client like Lighthouse or Prysm. The validator client contains any number of validator key pairs. Each pair corresponds to a validator: the public key is the validator\u2019s identity, and the secret key is what the validator client uses to sign messages on behalf of the validator. The validator client then broadcasts these signed messages to the Beacon chain network, essentially asserting the validator\u2019s view of the state of the chain.\n\nValidator clients can store validator keys on their machines and sign locally, or they can use a remote signer. A remote signer stores keys remotely and exposes a signing API to the validator client. At each epoch, the validator client makes a signing request to the remote signer, and the signer sends back a signed validation message. Although network latency makes remote signing slower than local signing due to the additional network round trip, operators use remote signers for many reasons, including:\n\nSecurity \u2013 By using a remote signer, the validator keys can be isolated from: The validator client \u2013 This interfaces with the untrusted world\u2014other Beacon chain nodes\u2014and runs untrusted Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code. Insider threats \u2013 These include the operators keeping the nodes up and running, who don\u2019t need access to the validator secret keys to do their jobs.\n\n\u2013 By using a remote signer, the validator keys can be isolated from: Correctness \u2013 Using a remote signer makes it possible to implement a reference monitor\u2014by coupling the signer with an anti-slashing database\u2014that ensures that a key never signs messages that could result in slashing\n\n\u2013 Using a remote signer makes it possible to implement a reference monitor\u2014by coupling the signer with an anti-slashing database\u2014that ensures that a key never signs messages that could result in slashing Availability \u2013 Using a remote signer that handles all validator keys makes it possible for node operators to automatically scale the validator clients and spin up new ones when they crash\n\nThe remote signer must be designed with these properties in mind\u2014simply using an off-the-shelf signer like Web3Signer doesn\u2019t give you these properties. For example, the remote signer must restrict who has access to keys\u2014this means restricting access to only authorized users (and validator clients) and sealing the keys to the signer itself\u2014and what they can do with the keys. Otherwise, a breach or insider threat can turn into key theft. The remote signer must itself be highly available and fault-tolerant, and it must use a global, highly available, anti-slashing database; otherwise, signer or OS updates, machine failures, or network interruptions could result in slashing events. Finally, although the remote signer doesn\u2019t need to be as fast as local (unsafe) signing, the latency of the remote signer does matter: if it\u2019s too slow (typically anything over a second), the validator will be late signing messages and lose the operator money.\n\nIn the following sections, we explain in detail how we achieved the goal of security, correctness, and availability by implementing our Nitro Enclaves-based CubeSigner remote signing solution.\n\nCubist CubeSigner \u2013 Architecture overview\n\nTo address the correctness, security, and performance and reliability challenges from the previous section, we built CubeSigner, a new remote signing service that builds on AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), Amazon DynamoDB, and Nitro Enclaves.\n\nAt a high level, to process a validation message from a validator client, the signer completes the following steps:\n\nAccept the validation message via an HTTP interface based on Amazon API Gateway. Checks if that message is slashable using a signing history stored in DynamoDB. Signs the message\u2014as long as it\u2019s non-slashable\u2014using keys secured by AWS KMS and Nitro Enclaves.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.\n\nIn the following sections, we walk through these three steps in detail.\n\nAuthenticated, high-level signing API\n\nThe signer needs to expose an API that validator clients like Lighthouse and Prysm can use out of the box. Unlike the AWS KMS API, which exposes a simple but low-level signing endpoint, this API must handle high-level validator messages specific to the Ethereum Beacon chain. This high-level API is essential because it can enforce an anti-slashing policy on validator messages based on their contents. If the API instead ingested and signed raw hashes of messages, it would have no way to determine whether a given message was slashable.\n\nIn addition to preventing slashing, this high-level API also needs to ensure that validation requests are from authenticated validator clients\u2014otherwise, compromising a single client would mean compromising all validator clients and all keys. CubeSigner goes a step further, using authentication with fine-grained scopes. A scope restricts an authenticated session so that it can only perform certain actions (for example, validation). By only giving validator clients the validation scope, node operators can prevent those validators from, for example, signing exit messages and exiting the validation protocol. This stops operators from accidentally exiting their validators, and protects them from attackers trying to exit on their behalf (costing rewards).\n\nCubeSigner uses API Gateway with AWS Lambda authorizers to implement a custom authorization scheme that determines the caller\u2019s identity. Each authorized signing request is then sent to CubeSigner\u2019s Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, which first check that the authorized scopes allow the request. Then, the signer computes the message signing root hash, applies the anti-slashing policy to ensure that signing the message (hash) won\u2019t result in a slashable offense, and signs it, returning the signature back to the validator client. Next, we discuss anti-slashing and signing itself.\n\nAnti-slashing\n\nCubeSigner implements anti-slashing in the second tier\u2014the policy engine. After authorizing a signing request, CubeSigner applies several policies, including built-in anti-slashing for Ethereum. The anti-slashing policy follows EIP-3076 and ensures that a validator never signs messages that would disagree with the chain history that the validator has already committed to, which means that the policy requires a saving state. CubeSigner enforces this policy using DynamoDB as its database. It atomically and conditionally records the messages it signs for every validator key, ensuring, for example, that the signer only produces a single signature for any particular slot number.\n\nDynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data import and export tools. Availability and consistent performance are particularly critical when running blockchain validators because downtime, latencies, or data inconsistencies can directly result in financial losses. Given these requirements, DynamoDB is well suited because of its consistent single-digit millisecond performance and up to 99.999% availability. For additional information on DynamoDB performance, costs, and scalability features, refer to Amazon DynamoDB features.\n\nSafe signing\n\nThe third tier is the low-level signer itself\u2014the CubeSigner virtual hardware security module (vHSM). This tier builds on AWS KMS to sign validation messages in HSMs, where keys are safe from attackers.\n\nHSMs and AWS KMS\n\nIn security-sensitive business areas such as banking or domain certificate management, it\u2019s common to outsource key management-related tasks (for example, key storage or signing) to HSMs. HSMs consist of purpose-built hardware that ties cryptographic secrets to physical hardware, which makes them very tough to steal. Key extractions attacks on standard HSMs, for example, require a laboratory with an electron microscope\u2014otherwise, the HSM self-destruct circuit triggers, because it detects someone trying to steal keying material.\n\nUsing HSMs on their own is relatively difficult, however. Accessing them from within applications written in high-level languages typically requires a vendor-specific SDK, and the application itself needs to adhere to the PKCS11 API standard. AWS provides an accessible, HSM-based key management service called AWS KMS. AWS KMS is a fully managed service that lets you create and control cryptographic keys protected by HSMs classified at the FIPS 140-2 Security Level 3. Furthermore, it is accessible via the standard AWS SDK (for example, aws-sdk-kms for Rust).\n\nWhy not use AWS KMS on its own\n\nUsing AWS KMS alone is not enough to build a secure key manager for validators. The first problem is mechanical: Ethereum validators must sign using the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature scheme, but HSMs don\u2019t yet support BLS because of regulatory challenges aligning with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). HSMs primarily focus on providing cryptographic signature schemes that are more ubiquitous outside the blockchain industry, namely RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Extending support for newer signature schemes usually requires low-level firmware upgrades of the HSM itself.\n\nEven if HSMs could produce BLS signatures, we would encounter a second set of problems: latency and throughput. Ethereum node operators run hundreds to thousands of validators, all of which must sign in under roughly a second (accounting for the actual cryptographic operation and network round trip). Most HSMs aren\u2019t optimized for batching public key cryptography operations (for example, the compound latencies in KMS for sending 100s of ECDSA signing operations would exceed the one second limit). Furthermore, HSMs are typically throughput limited (per default, AWS KMS can process 300 elliptic curve asymmetric operations per second). By combining AWS KMS HSMs with Nitro Enclaves, you can implement a vHSM that overcomes these problems while preserving security guarantees.\n\nNitro Enclaves are separate, hardened, and highly constrained virtual machines. The AWS Nitro System, which is a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor, provides features such as strong isolation, hardware generated entropy via the Nitro Security Module, and cryptographic attestation\u2014allowing you to verify the enclave\u2019s identity and that only authorized code is running in the enclave.\n\nHow CubeSigner uses Nitro Enclaves with AWS KMS\n\nThe CubeSigner vHSM implements core signature schemes like BLS in software and runs this code in Nitro Enclaves. This lets it support arbitrary signature schemes and sign orders of magnitude faster than an HSM.\n\nThe vHSM encrypts all signing keys using an AWS KMS-based key wrapping key; whenever it gets a request to sign a transaction, it pulls the encrypted signing key and the key wrapping key into the enclave, decrypts the signing key, signs the transaction, and returns it to the user. Signing in the vHSM is fast enough for validating without penalty (for example, is well under the 500ms target even accounting for network latency). This is because:\n\nSigning a message requires a single signing key decryption, and HSMs are well-optimized for symmetric cryptographic operations. AWS KMS, for example, by default runs up to 50,000 combined symmetric encrypt/decrypt operations per second.\n\nNitro Enclaves can do asymmetric cryptographic operations (for example, produce the signature) at native speeds.\n\nCubeSigner stores all encrypted signing keys\u2014in our example, BLS validator keys, but in general keys for any signature scheme\u2014in DynamoDB. This allows us to replicate keys, back up keys, and use DynamoDB for scale and performance.\n\nThe key wrapping keys are stored and managed using AWS KMS, with one key wrapping key per node operator. This key is sealed to the vHSM in the enclave and made inaccessible to the AWS root user, which means that no one can use or extract the key wrapping key. Sealing a KMS key to an enclave is an extremely powerful primitive. It guarantees that the vHSM is the only component that can decrypt the operator\u2019s signing keys, which makes it possible for us to implement hardware abstractions like the HSM in software.\n\nBecause only the code in the enclave can access secret keys, keeping keys safe reduces to keeping enclave code safe. To this end, that code is has the following features:\n\nWritten in Rust \u2013 We wrote the singer in Rust because it gives us low-level control over how the code handles secrets, so we can avoid leaking secrets in memory or through side channels. Rust also makes it straightforward to use verification techniques for proving the safety of the code running in the enclave.\n\n\u2013 We wrote the singer in Rust because it gives us low-level control over how the code handles secrets, so we can avoid leaking secrets in memory or through side channels.

Confined \u2013 The only outbound channel from the vHSM is to AWS KMS, following a secure communication flow. For more information, refer to How AWS Nitro Enclaves uses AWS KMS. Even here, however, the signer assumes that the channel may be compromised and uses the ephemeral private and public key associated with the particular enclave to encrypt the AWS KMS result with the public key stored in the attestation document. This way, the AWS KMS result can only be decrypted and read inside the enclave where the AWS KMS decrypt call originated in the first place.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we covered the operational traps and pitfalls of running Ethereum validator nodes and, in particular, the security, correctness, and availability challenges node operators have to balance daily. Remote signing, in contrast to managing keys locally on the node, can address these challenges\u2014but the design of the remote signer matters. To this end, we detailed the design of CubeSigner, a remote signing solution based on Nitro Enclaves, and showed how CubeSigner not only addresses the security and correctness (slashing) challenges operators face, but also how it makes it straightforward to eliminate operational costs and run highly available validator clusters.\n\nWe encourage you to sign up for a Cubist CubeSigner sandbox account, start up your Ethereum validator using an AWS Blockchain Node Runners template, and run your own Ethereum validator node.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nFraser Brown is a co-founder and the CTO of Cubist.

Over-reliance on Layer 2s could lead to fractured ecosystems and liquidity, as activity trends away from the base layer. Additionally, Layer 2s may involve more trust assumptions and can have sub-optimal influence on the base layer if transactions and fees are increasingly taken off the base chain. Rich Rines, Core DAO initial contributor\n\nRines noted that observers must closely monitor Dencun\u2019s progress after deployment, which is expected by March 13 barring unforeseen delays. The Core DAO contributor also said questions may arise about whether the upgrade\u2019s objective was the correct goal in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, Wormhole Foundation co-founder and CCO Robinson Burkey views Dencun optimistically and expects the upgrade to herald a massive increase in cross-chain asset transfers.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is undeniably a positive development for the crypto space. This upgrade will really enhance Ethereum\u2019s scalability and security, which bodes well for defi and overall interoperability. This will result in cheaper and easier asset movement and more affordable transactions on Ethereum. Robinson Burkey, Wormhole Foundation co-founder and CCO,\n\nBurkey opined that the Dencun upgrade will bolster defi usage, accessibility, and dynamism as cheaper fees should incentivize greater on-chain participation in crypto\u2019s largest decentralized ecosystem."

        "title": "Here\u2019s How Low ETH Can Go if $3.5K Fails to Hold Selling Pressure (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Ethereum has recently breached a significant resistance level, crossing the psychological milestone of $4K and achieving a new high for the year.\n\nHowever, this breakthrough was met with resistance, leading to a noticeable correction. The question that arises now is whether this correction is merely a temporary setback or the beginning of a broader reversal in the bullish trend.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of the daily chart indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, evident in a strong and sudden upward surge that surpassed the critical resistance at $4K. This surge reflects heightened interest from market participants in Ethereum, resulting in increased volatility.\n\nHowever, after briefly surpassing the crucial $4K resistance level, the price encountered intensified selling pressure, likely due to profit-taking among participants, leading to a significant decline toward the substantial support zone of around $3.5K. It seems likely that the market will find support in this region and initiate a fresh rally.\n\nHowever, in the event of a continued corrective retracement, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to find support around key levels within the Fibonacci retracement, specifically between the 0.5 ($3,181) and 0.618 ($2,966) levels.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nFurther examination of the 4-hour chart confirms the presence of buyers in the Ethereum market, propelling the price to its highest level since April 2022. This surge, accompanied by increased market volatility, demonstrates significant buying interest aimed at surpassing the previous all-time high of $4.8K.\n\nHowever, following the breakthrough above the critical $4K resistance level, the price faced rejection, leading to a sharp decline aiming for the key support zones around $3.5K and $3.3K. Additionally, an expanding bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator suggests the potential for a notable market correction.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that healthy bullish markets often experience periods of consolidation correction, allowing the asset to rest and rebuild demand. Therefore, it seems likely that the price will find support in the medium term, continuing its overall upward trend.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum\u2019s price has surged rapidly in recent weeks, briefly surpassing its previous all-time high of $4,000. This surge has attracted numerous speculators to the market, driving up buying pressure and instilling confidence among investors.\n\nThe accompanying chart illustrates the open interest, a valuable metric for assessing sentiment in the futures market. Open interest quantifies the number of outstanding perpetual futures contracts across various crypto exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the open interest has soared alongside the recent bullish trend, reaching unprecedented levels. This surge indicates the intensity of both long and short positions in the perpetual futures market, resulting in an overheated environment.\n\nWhile elevated open interest is typical in a robust bull market, it can also contribute to heightened volatility and unexpected market corrections. As such, it\u2019s prudent for investors to carefully manage their risk in the short term."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Drops 7.8% A Day After Dencun Upgrade, What\u2019s the Next Support? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Following the successful implementation of the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has encountered significant selling pressure. As of the latest update, the Ethereum (ETH) price has declined by 7.8%, trading at $3,669 with a market capitalization of nearly $450 billion. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s daily trading volume has surged by 45% to $32.29 billion\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Levels to Watch Ahead\n\nThe Ethereum price faced resistance at the $4,000 level and initiated a downward correction, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s movement. ETH dipped below crucial support levels at $3,920 and $3,850, signaling a short-term bearish trend.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt briefly dropped below the $3,680 support area, reaching a low of $3,625 before consolidating losses. Currently, a significant bearish trend line is forming with resistance around $3,850. The primary resistance levels are near $3,850 and the trend line, close to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent swing high at $4,083 to the low of $3,625.\n\nIf the Ethereum (ETH) price surpasses the $3,880 resistance, it may regain bullish momentum, aiming for the $4,000 level. Conversely, failure to break above $3,850 could lead to further downside movement. Initial support is at $3,680, followed by a major support zone near $3,600, with a potential downside target at $3,500. A decisive break below $3,500 might trigger a decline toward $3,350.\n\nPopular crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto explained that the range of $3600-$3700 for Ethereum is likely to attract significant buying interest in the short term.\n\nFurthermore, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic uncovered a substantial transaction involving $12 million worth of Ether by the Lazarus Group. This transfer was facilitated through Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer. Despite being subject to sanctions, the North Korean hacker organization has resumed its use of this platform.\n\nThe funds are traced back to a cyber-attack on HTX and the Heco Bridge in November, orchestrated by the Lazarus group. This attack resulted in significant losses amounting to $100 million for the affected platforms.\n\nETH Gas Fee Drops Under $10\n\nAccording to Santiment, an on-chain data provider, the current scenario of Ethereum surpassing a $4,000 market value differs from October and November 2021. Today, the network\u2019s transaction costs are significantly lower, standing at less than 1/6th of the previous levels. With gas fees averaging $9.35, this improvement can be attributed in part to the enhancements in network fees following the transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "American investment management firm VanEck thinks spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could become bigger than similar Bitcoin products after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) eventually approves them in the coming months.\n\nIn a recent interview, Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager of VanEck, one of the issuers of the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January, said Ethereum ETFs could attract more demand as they have a market size as big, if not bigger, than Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nEthereum ETFs Could Surpass Bitcoin ETFs\n\nKanade\u2019s belief contrasts with some crypto community members, who think Ethereum ETFs will not make much sense as the products may not allow staking reward distribution. Recall that Ethereum transitioned into a Proof-of-Stake protocol in 2022. Ether (ETH) holders can earn diverse yields by staking their assets on the blockchain.\n\nMarket analysts believe crypto investors should buy and stake their own ETH rather than invest in the ETFs. However, Kanade insists otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe world of investors who are looking for cash producing assets is massive and ETH obviously generates fees that goes to the token holders. Even if you don\u2019t have an ETF that can offer staking as a part of it, it\u2019s still a cash producing asset, so I think ETH could make more sense as an asset to more people than Bitcoin does,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile the VanEck portfolio manager thinks Ethereum ETFs could surpass Bitcoin funds, he sees such a feat as a huge task, considering the inflows exceeding $11 billion that the spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen within two months of their launch.\n\nOdds of SEC Ethereum ETF Approval at 50%\n\nIn addition to Kanade\u2019s controversial belief that Ethereum ETFs will outpace Bitcoin funds, he placed the odds of the SEC approving the former at 50%, contrary to Bloomberg analysts\u2019 30% prediction.\n\nConsidering that the SEC was legally forced to approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs, courtesy of the Grayscale court ruling, it seems unlikely that the agency is eager to greenlight similar products for Ethereum.\n\nNevertheless, agency commissioner Hester Pierce, popularly known as Crypto Mom, believes the regulator would not need a lawsuit or court order to approve pending applications for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nMeanwhile, VanEck recently reduced the management fee for its Bitcoin ETF, HODL, from 0.2% to 0% to lure more investors to the product. The current fee will stay until March 2025 or until HODL amasses $1.5 billion in assets under management."

        "content": "Upland has announced its Airdrop \u201cShare and Build\u201d program in anticipation of the launch of its token on Ethereum. The cryptocurrency game is gearing up for the debut of the Sparklet token and is offering rewards to users through game missions and social media interactions.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nUpland Airdrop Strategy: Launching the Ethereum Token\n\nAs anticipated, Upland, a game of cryptocurrencies based on real-world locations around the world, announced on Friday the launch of the first phase of the \u201cShare and Build\u201d airdrop series.\n\nThe goal is to reward both existing community members and new users who engage with the Upland platform before the launch of its token on Ethereum.\n\nThe first chapter of the series will allow users to earn Sparklet tokens, used within the game to build buildings and create content, by participating in activities on social media and missions within the application for a period of three weeks.\n\nLast November, Upland, based on EOS, announced plans to launch an Ethereum token linked to the Sparklet game token.\n\nThe whitepaper detailing these plans has been submitted to the community vote, with 87% of users voting in favor of the proposal.\n\nThe token commercialization event (TTE) will follow the airdrop campaign, allowing users to convert the in-game Sparklet currency into a tradable Ethereum token.\n\nAirdrop and NFT: expanding the gaming experience in the metaverse\n\nDirk Lueth, co-founder and co-CEO of Upland, stated the following:\n\n\u201cWe are excited to launch the \u2018Share and Build\u2019 airdrop series as we prepare for the Sparklet event. This initiative aligns perfectly with our vision to promote a thriving Web3 ecosystem and reward passionate players.\u201d\n\nThe first phase of the launch campaign offers 10 different reward levels, with user engagement levels and social statistics on Twitter determining their point multipliers.\n\nFurthermore, selected Upland partner users will receive \u201cpoint boosts\u201d to increase their earnings.\n\nIn addition, each completed chapter of the airdrop will guarantee participants a unique NFT Block Explorer, which will serve as a gaming element within Upland.\n\nBy accumulating five of these awards, you will gain access to an exclusive NFT to use in the world of Upland.\n\nWe remind you that Upland originated in 2019 as a property trading game, with digital versions of real assets tokenized and sold within the game.\n\nOver time, it has evolved into a solid metaverse, offering vehicles, events, and other gaming opportunities. Last November, Upland raised $7 million in a Series A extension round.\n\nRevenues for Upland players in 2023 and more\n\nUpland has generated approximately $13.5 million in revenue for players in 2023, establishing itself as a growing digital economy and an economic hub in the Web3.\n\nRevenues are withdrawn in USD via PayPal in collaboration with Tilia, a payment solution offered by Second Life, another Metaverse platform. Additionally, players can withdraw their funds using Upland\u2019s native UPX.\n\nThe co-CEO and co-founder of Upland, Dirk Lueth, shared this information in a press release with NFTgators, stating:\n\n\u201cThe platform has over 3 million registered users with active participation, turning Upland into an immersive digital economy.\u201d\n\nPlaying and selling virtual properties on Upland has allowed uplanders to make millions in profits, while the platform has formed partnerships with entities such as FIFA, UNICEF Brazil, and Susan G. Komen.\n\nUpland emerges as a symbol of the power of GamiFi, true ownership, and engaging digital economy.\n\nFurthermore, Upland has announced progress in the ecosystem of user-generated content (UGC), open to all individuals.\n\nThe platform offers players the opportunity to verify the size of the property and the potential to adapt to different structures, welcoming valuable user feedback.\n\nThe video of the roadmap for the first quarter of 2024, published on January 10, 2024, reveals that Upland will focus on automotive transportation, car races, Sparklet, and renewed seasons."

        "content": "Grayscale said case for Ethereum spot ETFs as strong as that of Bitcoin.\n\nConcerns regarding the approval started to surface.\n\nGrayscale Investments submitted a revised filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to transition its flagship Ethereum [ETH] trust into a spot ETF.\n\nOne step closer\n\nCraig Salm, the company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, informed about the amended Form 19b-4 on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThis indicated a pivotal step towards listing the Ethereum spot ETF shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), thereby allowing investors to profit from the price movements of the world\u2019s second-largest digital asset.\n\nFor the curious, Form 19b-4 is a document filed with the SEC to propose a rule change. This is usually done when a stock exchange wants to list a new product, for example spot ETFs.\n\nSalm said,\n\n\u201cInvestors want and deserve access to Ethereum in the form of a spot Ethereum ETF, and we believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nWill Ethereum be lucky?\n\nThe world\u2019s largest digital asset manager applied with the U.S. regulator last year to transform its $10 billion-plus ETH trust (ETHE), which is currently traded over-the-counter (OTC), to a spot ETF.\n\nNote that the company succeeded in getting its Bitcoin [BTC] trust transitioned to spot ETF following a court order. Just like Bitcoin\u2019s approval journey, the SEC has been delaying decisions on ETH spot applications.\n\nBritish multinational bank Standard Chartered had earlier forecasted that the SEC would dilly-dally until eventually approving by 23rd of May, the final deadline for the first list of ETF applications.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, unlike Bitcoin\u2019s case, there hasn\u2019t been clear dialogue between the issuers and the regulator vis \u00e0 vis Ethereum ETFs. The radio silence was stoking uncertainty and lowering the odds of approval, according to experts.\n\nPolitical pushback has also started. Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler wrote to the SEC, urging to \u201cstrictly limit\u201d applications for approval of crypto ETFs. The senators argued that the markets for other cryptos other than Bitcoin were \u201cfar more exposed to misconduct.\u201d"

Technicals suggest a continuation of the fall, amid a nose-diving Relative Strength Index (RSI), which suggests momentum is falling.\n\nThe histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are flashing green, a sign of the bears\u2019 having a strong presence in the BTC market. Additionally, the volume indicator is showing large red bars, showing the downtrend is gaining strength.\n\nBitcoin price could extend the fall, which means investors could still have an opportunity to buy lower before a strong move north ahead of the BTC halving.

To confirm the uptrend, investors must watch for a candlestick close above $64,044, the mean threshold of the supply zone between $71,290 and $73,193.

A move above the $0.700 psychological level would inspire more buy orders, reinvigorating the trend for XRP price to clear the $0.7500 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Ripple price could reach the $0.8000 psychological level.

It significantly reduces the cost of transactions on so-called \u2018Layer 2s.\u2019\n\nEach day, Coinrule will run through the state of the digital assets market for Blockbeat, your home for news, analysis, opinion and commentary on blockchain and digital assets.\n\nWhen cars first started to appear in the 19th century, they were a truly ridiculous sight. Clunky, noisy and big, it was hard to imagine for most contemporaries that these machines would ever be good for anything. Worst of all? There just was not much use for them. After all, most roads were not in a state to support cars. Fast forward 100 years and the picture had changed.\n\nLooking back, the rise of blockchains and Ethereum as the foundation of the new financial system will seem equally inevitable. Last week, Ethereum developers launched the new Dencun upgrade. It significantly reduces the cost of transactions on so-called \u2018Layer 2s.\u2019 While the upgrade itself was a major milestone, it also shows that the Ethereum roadmap is progressing towards scalability, security and decentralisation. In the public perception of many, blockchains may live somewhere between memecoin gambling and vaporware. This is similar to how cars were seen before the advent of infrastructure designed to support them. But some of the best computer scientists and cryptographers in the world are busy building these roads.\n\nThe endgame for blockchains seems to be a so-called modular approach: different Layer 2s with their own setups provide varying degrees of speed and decentralisation. Corporations might gather around \u2018permissioned\u2019 Layer 2s where participants have to go through KYC. Specific applications that require large throughput might use their own Layer 3, a so-called \u2018app-chain.\u2019 Ethereum\u2019s Market Cap of close to $500 billion provides substantial economic security for this ecosystem. It will also be built around Ethereum\u2019s ethos of credible neutrality and permissionless-ness at Layer 1. Eventually, the ability to have finance \u2018natively\u2019 built into the digital world will allow use-cases that we cannot even imagine today. From machine-to-machine payments, a more equitable global financial system and hundred times lower cost of trade finance and cross-border payments, the transition to blockchain-based finance will happen slowly, then suddenly.\n\nThe main challenge on the way is to ensure that all these blockchain \u2018modules\u2019 keep the main benefits of the system. These are the shared liquidity that enables financial use-cases on a large scale. It is also the composability that allows programmers to connect with applications across all platforms. But as Dencun\u2019s successful launch shows once again, Ethereum is quietly executing on its roadmap."

Moreover, they asserted that markets for other cryptocurrencies lack the trading volumes and integrity to support associated ETPs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe senators emphasized, \u201cFinally, we believe the SEC should strictly limit the precedential application of these approvals.\u201d Hence, the chances of SEC approving Spot Ether ETFs in May have lowered significantly. Furthermore, the letter also warned against the risks posed by thinly traded cryptocurrencies and those susceptible to fraudulent schemes.\n\nIn addition, Senators Reed and Butler expressed skepticism regarding the suitability of these assets for ETPs, citing potential risks to retail investors. They underscored the SEC\u2019s discretion in approving such products, urging restraint in the face of heightened risks. The letter concluded, \u201cRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas significantly lowered the likelihood of a Spot Ethereum ETF approval in May, from 60\u201370% to 30%. This decline in optimism coincided with dissatisfaction in the market regarding the SEC\u2019s handling of Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nMoreover, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement and silence on the matter has left the market uncertain about its eventual decision. Hence, if the regulator agency decides to adhere to the request made by the U.S. senators, it could possibly reject the Spot Ethereum ETF applications by giants like BlackRock, Grayscale and others. In addition, the possibility of XRP, SHIB, or TRX ETFs might also be ruled out.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF: Cetera Approves IBIT BTCO, FBTC, EZBC For Trading\n\nScrutiny Over Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSenators Reed and Butler also highlighted the need for clarity in terminology, emphasizing that the Bitcoin ETF offerings should be referred to as Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) rather than ETFs. They stressed the importance of ensuring investors receive complete and accurate information about crypto ETPs. Moreover, these U.s. senators called for close examination of broker-dealers\u2019 communications to mitigate the risk of misinformation.\n\nFurthermore, the senators underscored the regulatory obligation to safeguard investors\u2019 interests. They pressured the SEC to \u201cexamine brokers and advisers that recommend cryptocurrency ETPs to ensure they are, in fact, acting in the best interests of their clients, as required by SEC rules.\u201d Moreover, they emphasize the importance of scrutinizing advisers recommending cryptocurrency ETPs to ascertain compliance with SEC regulations.\n\nAnother critical aspect highlighted in the letter pertains to naming conventions used in SEC filings and investor documents. Senators Reed and Butler call for measures to ensure that Bitcoin ETFs do not utilize inappropriate or confusing naming conventions, thereby enhancing transparency and clarity for investors.\n\nThey stated, \u201cEnsure that bitcoin ETPs do not use inappropriate and confusing naming conventions in SEC filings and other investor documents.\u201d The crypto industry is bracing for further challenges as Spot Bitcoin ETFs are now expected to be in the SEC\u2019s radar. Meanwhile, the hype for May approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs has faded owing to the uncertainties.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin ETF Inflow Drops 80% To $133M As BTC Price Retreats\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "The recent fluctuations in Ethereum\u2019s price have drawn attention to the involvement of major players like FTX and Alameda Research. In the past days, data from Spot on Chain shows these entities have been actively moving significant amounts of Ethereum, totaling 6,500 ETH valued at $24.57 million, to Coinbase. Interestingly, these transactions have been closely followed by notable drops in Ethereum\u2019s market value, indicating a potential correlation between the movements of FTX and Alameda Research and Ethereum\u2019s price dynamics.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalysis of Recent Transactions and Price Impact\n\nFTX and Alameda Research have been busy in the Ethereum market, executing multiple transactions in recent days. These transactions involve significant amounts of Ethereum being deposited to Coinbase, along with movements of other assets totaling $6.26 million.\n\nNotably, the market has reacted swiftly to these transactions, with Ethereum experiencing notable price drops following the majority of these movements. Graphical representations of these price movements highlight the correlation between the transactions executed by FTX and Alameda Research and the subsequent dips in Ethereum\u2019s market value, suggesting a potential causal relationship between the two.\n\nAlso Read: NFPrompt Suffers Major Hack: FBI Steps In To Ensure User Safety\n\nTechnical Analysis and Outlook\n\nTurning to technical analysis, Ethereum\u2019s current price trend reveals the formation of a significant bearish trend line, with resistance observed around $3,850. Key resistance levels are identified near $3,850 and the trend line, closely aligned with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from recent swing highs to lows. Potential scenarios for Ethereum\u2019s price movement hinge on breaking these resistance levels.\n\nA successful breach above $3,880 could signal a resurgence in bullish momentum, potentially pushing Ethereum towards the $4,000 mark. Conversely, failure to overcome $3,850 might lead to further downside movement. Initial support is expected around $3,680, followed by a major support zone near $3,600. A decisive break below $3,500 could trigger a deeper decline towards $3,350, warranting close monitoring of key support and resistance levels in the days ahead.\n\nAlso Read: Digital Chamber CEO Advocates Bitcoin As \u201cInflation Proof\u201d Amid Hot CPI & PPI\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Crypto news: the launch of Alpha marks the activation of the decentralized sequencer of Metis, representing a significant step forward for the scalability of Ethereum through the implementation of this milestone.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nMetis Crypto Sequencer: Steps Forward for Ethereum\n\nAs anticipated, Metis, the Layer-2 scalability platform of Ethereum comparable to the EVM, has launched the Alpha version of its innovative Decentralized Sequencer. This marks a significant step towards the decentralization of rollups.\n\nThe decentralized Sequencer represents a significant advancement compared to the single sequencer model currently adopted by other Layer-2 rollup solutions.\n\nThis launch positions Metis as the first rollup of Ethereum to adopt a decentralized approach to its sequencer. Rollups represent one of the most promising scalability solutions, but currently they have some drawbacks.\n\nTo fully ensure the security of Ethereum, a decentralized fraud/validity proof system and a decentralized sequencer are needed.\n\nSo far, no other rollup has focused on the decentralization of the sequencer, making them vulnerable to single points of failure and potentially subject to censorship.\n\nWith this new feature, instead, by keeping control over a single sequencer, the foundations maintain almost total control over the network and its revenues.\n\nSecurity, fairness, and community involvement in the crypto network\n\nThe adoption of a decentralized sequencer by Metis allows multiple entities to manage the sequencers. This improves the security and decentralization of the network and enables a more equitable revenue sharing with users.\n\nA distributed sequencer also paves the way for crucial functions such as seamless and secure sequencer rotation, the ejection of malfunctioning or harmful entities, and increased network stability.\n\nUsers can contribute to maintaining the decentralization, transparency, and stability of the network by becoming sequencers and participating in the consensus process.\n\nThe participation of multiple entities makes it more difficult for malicious actors to control or compromise the order of transactions.\n\nThe Sequencer nodes can earn rewards in METIS tokens for their role in block production and transaction processing within the network.\n\nActive participation from the community can lead to greater recognition within the group, paving the way for future collaborations or potential partnerships.\n\nFurthermore, during the first year, all sequencer nodes will benefit from a Mining Rewards Rate (MRR) of 20%.\n\nMetis gets a price rally with listing on Binance\n\nMetis has experienced a significant increase of about 27-30% after the announcement of its inclusion on the Binance trading platform.\n\nThe inclusion on Binance of the crypto has effectively introduced the project to a wide range of traders and investors, increasing its liquidity and accessibility.\n\nThe surge in the token price can be attributed to various factors, including the increase in visibility and credibility resulting from being listed on Binance, as well as the growing market interest in Layer 2 scalability solutions like Metis.\n\nParticularly significant is the fact that Binance has waived the listing fee for Metis, demonstrating confidence in the potential of the project and commitment to promoting innovation in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe designation of \u201cSeed Tag\u201d conferred to Metis by Binance highlights its status as an innovative project, which could involve greater volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens.\n\nThe increase in Metis prices and its listing on Binance have coincided with a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has recently surpassed its previous all-time high, exceeding $71,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has temporarily exceeded $4,000, further contributing to the bullish sentiment around Metis and other promising blockchain projects."

The SEC's Bitcoin ETF approval allowed several reputable investment institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark21Shares, among many others, to give customers access to the most popular digital asset.\n\nLess than two months after their launch, these ETFs have been one of the main catalysts for Bitcoin's price, sending it to a fresh all-time high of $73,600 on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler said the SEC made the wrong move by greenlighting crypto ETFs. In a letter dated March 11, they stated several reasons why crypto ETFs pose a threat to the financial well-being of retail investors.\n\nFurthermore, they accused brokers of violating fair disclosure rules by intentionally obscuring important information and employing \"naming and marketing that appear to obfuscate important characteristics about these investments.\"\n\nAlso read: Cetera proclaims \u2018prudent embrace\u2019 of spot BTC ETF usage, expert says more to come\n\nSpot Ether ETFs approval has slim chances\n\nThis letter comes at a time when eight spot Ether (ETH) ETFs from reputable firms like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, etc., await a decision from the SEC later in May.\n\nIn a post on X, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated the success of Bitcoin ETF is upsetting high-ranking Democrats, leading to a pessimistic view of a spot ETH ETF approval chances.\n\nThe senators also mentioned that the SEC should slow down in approving any other crypto ETFs.\"While the bitcoin market has displayed serious weakness, it is nonetheless far more established and scrutinized than the market for any other cryptocurrency,\" they said.\n\nReed and Butler expressed concerns that ETPs representing cryptocurrencies with low trading volume will expose retail investors to high risks.\n\nThe market has yet to respond to this news as institutional brokers or the SEC haven't commented on the letter as of the time of writing.\n\nRead more: Ethereum price trades above $4,000 while anti-Ether political campaigns downplay spot ETH ETF"

        "content": "Asset management firm Grayscale Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin\u2019s, Grayscale Argues\n\nAccording to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has revised its 19b-4 form for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was \u201cimportant\u201d in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\nThe chief legal officer stated in his post that investors \u201cwant and deserve access\u201d to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. \u201cWe believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm said.\n\nThe asset manager is amongst the numerous firms looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock\u2019s filing on March 4, 2024.\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.\n\nSEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval\n\nTwo US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products.

        "content": "The past 24 hours have seen a decline in the general cryptocurrency market.\n\nBTC, ETH, and XRP prices may witness further decline in the short term.\n\nAs the crypto market overheats, the values of many leading assets have declined over the past 24 hours. Due to this, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization plummeted by 7% during the same period, according to Coingecko\u2019s data.\n\nAt the time of writing, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $2.7 trillion.\n\nLong liquidations in the Bitcoin market\n\nLeading coin Bitcoin [BTC] has seen its price decline by almost 10% in the past 24 hours. During Asian trading hours of 15th March, the price of the coin dropped to a low of $67,000, marking a 7% decline, before a brief rebound to $68,500.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, the number one coin exchanged hands at $67,742 as of this writing, registering an 8% price decline in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, during the same period, the coin\u2019s trading volume rallied by 55%, thereby creating a bearish price/volume divergence. This indicated a heightened selling pressure amid the high market activity.\n\nThis divergence between an asset\u2019s price and its trading volume is common when many investors sell off their holdings, potentially due to negative sentiment or concerns about future price movements.\n\nDue to the sharp fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price, long liquidations in the coin\u2019s futures market surged. According to Coinglass\u2019 data, over $90 million in long positions have been erased over the last 12 hours.\n\nA position is deemed to have been liquidated when it is forcefully closed due to insufficient funds to maintain it. Long liquidations occur when the value of an asset suddenly drops, and traders who have open positions in favor of a price rally are forced to exit their positions.\n\nHowever, despite this decline, the coin\u2019s futures open interest continued to climb. In the last 24 hours, this increased by 2%. Per Coinglass data, BTC\u2019s futures open interest was $37.25 billion at press time.\n\nLikewise, its funding rates observed across crypto exchanges remained positive. The rise in open interest and the positive funding rates showed that despite the current price decline, investors have chosen to remain steadfast in their conviction that Bitcoin\u2019s price would still initiate a rally.\n\nThe bears are looking to regain control of the Ethereum market\n\nDue to its statistically positive correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH] has also suffered a decline in its value in the last 24 hours. Exchanging hands at $3,708 at press time, the coin\u2019s price has dropped by 7% during that period.\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s price performance on a daily chart showed a steady uptick in coin sell-offs.\n\nFor example, readings from the coin\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed that its signal line (orange) successfully crossed above the MACD line (blue) on 14th March.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s signal line intersects its MACD line in an uptrend, it\u2019s typically considered a bearish signal. This is because the signal line is a 9-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the MACD line itself. It acts as a trigger for buy and sell signals. When it crosses above the MACD line, it suggests a potential shift towards a bearish trend.\n\nTypically, traders interpret this bearish crossover as a signal to sell or a warning sign of a potential downturn in the market.\n\nFurther, suggesting the decline in demand for ETH amongst spot market participants, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in a downtrend. Although it remained above the center line at press time, its position indicated a decline in ETH accumulation.\n\nConfirming the steady fall in ETH demand, its on-balance volume (OBV), which measures the coin\u2019s buying and selling pressure, was down by 0.3% in the past 24 hours. When an asset\u2019s OBV line falls, it indicates that the selling volume is increasing, suggesting downward price movement.\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s exchange activity in the past 24 hours confirmed the increase in profit-taking activity.

        "title": "Ethereum Staking Explained: Is ETH Staking Worth It? - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Yes, Ethereum staking is worth it for most holders. Staking earns you rewards and contributes to the security and functionality of the Ethereum network. If you want to stake ETH as a solo staker you need 32 ETH, which is a high bar for most holders. However, liquid staking solutions allow users to stake much smaller amounts and generate virtually the same rewards.\n\nIn September 2022, the Ethereum blockchain received its biggest upgrade to date. The Merge upgrade moved Ethereum from Proof-of-Work over to Proof-of-Stake. The transition to Proof-of-Stake has made the Ethereum much more environmentally friendly and also laid the foundation for future upgrades, which will significantly improve the scalability of the network.\n\nWith the introduction of Proof-of-Stake on Ethereum, ETH holders now have the opportunity to stake their coins and earn staking rewards in the form of additional ETH. In this article, we\u2019ll explain Ethereum staking and present the different options ETH holders have when it comes to earning staking rewards.\n\nKey highlights: The Ethereum network transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in September of 2021.\n\nThis means that ETH holders can now stake their ETH to provide additional security to the network and earn rewards.\n\nIf you want to run your own validator, you need 32 ETH.\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH, you can still earn staking rewards. You can use liquid staking protocols such as Lido or stake your ETH with the help of a crypto exchange.\n\nWhat is Ethereum staking?\n\nEthereum now uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, in which validators stake ETH in exchange for participating in the consensus process. Validators are rewarded for adding new blocks to the Ethereum blockchain and for checking that blocks proposed by other validators follow the protocol\u2019s rules.\n\nValidators who are reliable and act in the best interests of the network receive ETH as a reward. At the time of writing, validators on Ethereum are earning an APR (annual percentage rate) of about 4%. If you\u2019re investing in Ethereum and don\u2019t plan to sell in the short term, staking ETH is certainly worth considering to passively grow your ETH holdings.\n\nThe rewards earned by each validator depend on the total number of validators that are active on the Ethereum network, as well as network activity (more activity means more potential income from transaction fees).\n\nThe catch is that validators who are not reliable or are found to be breaking the rules are punished by having a portion or the entirety of their ETH stake taken away.\n\nShould I stake my Ethereum?\n\nThere's little reason not to stake Ethereum if you plan on holding ETH for an extended period of time. While the rewards for staking are not enormous, they can still add up over time and increase your holdings. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,700. With an expected APR of 3.5% for staking, a single ETH would generate 0.035 ETH in rewards over 1 year ($129.5 at current market rates).\n\nIt's worth noting that Ethereum staking does have certain drawbacks. For one, you cannot withdraw your ETH immediately. This can be detrimental if you decide you'd like to sell ETH quickly, as you will typically have to wait a couple of hours up to a couple of days for your ETH to be unstaked (also known as a \"cooldown period\"). The cooldown period is different between different protocols and platforms.\n\nAnother potential drawback, which impacts liquid staking protocols exclusively, is the fact that the token you receive in exchange for your staked ETH (for example, stETH on Lido), can drop in value relative to Ethereum. This means that if you want to convert your stETH back to ETH to claim rewards and unstake ETH, you might be selling at a loss. However, this rarely occurs and is only really a concern during periods of extreme bearish activity.\n\nstETH (a liquid staking ETH derivative by Lido) is, for all intents and purposes, pegged to the value of ETH.\n\nWho can stake ETH?\n\nIn order to launch your own validator, you need to have 32 ETH. At the time of writing, this translates to about $57,000, so it\u2019s definitely not accessible to everyone from a financial perspective.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are still ways to earn staking rewards with your ETH, even if you don\u2019t have the 32 ETH required to launch your own validator. We\u2019ll discuss the different ways to stake ETH a bit further in the article below.\n\nInitially, staked ETH coins could not be withdrawn. However, this was changed with the Shapella upgrade in April of 2023, which gave users the ability to withdraw their staked coins.\n\nWhere to stake ETH?\n\nThere are four distinct options for ETH holders who want to stake their ETH and earn staking rewards.\n\nSolo staking\n\nStaking as a service\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking through crypto exchanges\n\nHowever, solo staking and staking as a service are limited to those that have at least 32 ETH.\n\nDo you have 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you have 32 or more ETH to stake, you can access solo staking or staking as a service solution. Of course, you can also use other ways of staking ETH that are also available to users who have less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nSolo staking\n\nSolo staking involves launching your own Ethereum validator and maintaining it yourself. Each validator you run requires a stake of 32 ETH.\n\nWhen you\u2019re solo staking, you\u2019re directly participating in the consensus process of the Ethereum blockchain and contribute to the network\u2019s decentralization. In addition, you remain in full control of your private keys and receive full staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. This is why the Ethereum Foundation describes solo staking as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for Ethereum staking.\n\nWhile solo staking certainly has a lot of benefits, it is the least accessible way to stake ETH for the average person. The most obvious barrier to entry is that you need at least 32 ETH, which is simply out of reach for most Ethereum investors. Operating a validator also requires some technical expertise, and you need to ensure that your validator stays online continuously to avoid inactivity penalties.\n\nStaking as a service\n\nThere are various staking as a service providers that offer to manage one or more Ethereum validators on your behalf. When using these services, you\u2019re required to provide ETH (32 ETH per validator). In most cases, you get to keep control of your private keys, which is a plus.\n\nOf course, staking as a service providers need some form of compensation for operating validator nodes on your behalf. So, while your validators will be earning ETH staking rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol, you will have to pay a fee to the service provider to keep your validators up and running.\n\nSo, staking as a service can be a good option if you have the sufficient amount of ETH to have your own validators but don\u2019t want to deal with the technical aspects of setting up a node and keeping it operational.\n\nOverall, your returns will be slightly lower than what you\u2019d get with solo staking, as you\u2019ll have to pay a fee to the provider. Some examples of staking as a service providers are BloxStaking and Abyss Finance.\n\nDo you have less than 32 ETH to stake?\n\nIf you don't have 32 ETH to stake, you can't engage in solo staking, but there are other options available to you.\n\nStaking pools\n\nStaking pools take ETH deposits from multiple users and pool them together to launch Ethereum validators. This makes it possible for anyone to stake their ETH, even if they don\u2019t have 32 ETH themselves.\n\nStaking pools are a very popular way of staking Ethereum, and many of them offer liquid staking, which is a very handy feature. Here are two examples of the top two Ethereum staking pools available today.\n\nLido\n\nLido is a liquid staking solution that supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Lido is the most popular way to stake Ethereum. At the time of writing, over 30% of all ETH was staked through Lido.\n\nAfter staking your ETH through Lido, you will receive an equivalent amount of stETH tokens, which represent your staked ETH and any accrued rewards. These stETH tokens can be used in DeFi protocols or even sold if you need liquidity.\n\nHowever, you should keep in mind that the stETH to ETH exchange rate is usually skewed in favor of ETH, so you will likely receive a bit less than 1 ETH for each stETH you sell. Of course, you are also able to redeem your stETH for staked ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nRocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool is also a liquid staking solution that allows users to stake smaller amounts of ETH. The minimum amount of ETH that can be staked through Rocket Pool is 0.01 ETH, which makes the service highly accessible.\n\nWhen you stake ETH through Rocket Pool, your staked coins and accrued rewards are represented with rETH tokens. Similarly to stETH, you can use rETH in any way you please. rETH holders can redeem their tokens for ETH on a 1:1 basis.\n\nOverall, staking pools are a good option for anyone who\u2019s looking to earn Ethereum staking rewards but has less than 32 ETH to stake.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nMany cryptocurrency exchanges offer Ethereum staking services to their users. For example, you can stake your Ethereum on Binance, which is a solid option since you will be able to retain liquidity thanks to BETH, a token that represents ETH staked through Binance.\n\nWhen staking through an exchange, you deposit ETH to the exchange. The exchange then pools together ETH from multiple users to deploy Ethereum validators. The rewards earned by these validators are then distributed to the users who staked their ETH, but the exchange will typically take a cut from the rewards as a fee for the service they provide.\n\nStaking through exchanges is probably the most convenient way to earn Ethereum staking rewards, but it also requires the most trust. When you deposit your ETH to a centralized crypto exchange, you have to trust that they will manage your funds responsibly. In addition, there could be a negative impact to the decentralization of Ethereum if exchanges control a large number of validators.\n\nComparison of Ethereum staking methods\n\nNow that we\u2019ve briefly explained each different Ethereum staking method, let\u2019s do a quick comparison of their pros and cons.\n\nMinimum amount Pros Cons Solo staking 32 ETH Full control over staking setup\n\nReceive full rewards\n\nContributes most to decentralization High barrier to entry\n\nRequires technical knowledge Staking as a service 32 ETH Much simpler than solo staking\n\nKeep control of keys required to withdraw or transfer staked ETH Service providers take a fee\n\nHigh barrier to entry Staking pools Small (0.01 ETH or less) You can stake smaller amounts of ETH\n\nMany staking pools offer liquidity tokens\n\nNon-custodial options available Smart contract risks\n\nLiquidity token price fluctuations Crypto exchanges Small (0.01 ETH or less) Very convenient way of staking ETH\n\nMany exchanges offer liquid staking options Requires trust in the exchange\n\nExchange takes a cut of the rewards\n\nCentralization risks\n\nEthereum \"restaking\"\n\nRecently, the concept of Ethereum \"restaking\" has started to gain traction in the crypto community. Through protocols such as EigenLayer, users who own staked ETH can choose to \"restake\" their coins to help provide security to applications that function on top of the Ethereum network. Essentially, this means that staked ETH can be used to validate networks and services other than the Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to earn additional rewards on top of the standard ETH staking yield.\n\nCurrently, the most popular Ethereum restaking protocol is EigenLayer, which supports restaking both for ETH as well as liquid staking tokens such as stETH and rETH. Please keep in mind that restaking is a relatively new concept and doesn't have a long track record in real-world conditions. If you're using a protocol such as EigenLayer to restake your ETH, you could be taking on substantially more risk than if you just kept your coins staked normally.\n\nThe bottom line\u2014ETH staking is a good choice for long-term holders\n\nEthereum staking is worth it if you\u2019re an ETH holder and plan to hold your coins over the long term. This is already the position of many ETH holders, as Ethereum is widely perceived as one of the best cryptocurrencies to hold for the long term. Before deciding whether staking is right for you, make sure to check the current ETH staking rewards to see what kind of APR to expect.\n\nIf you\u2019re also interested in cryptocurrencies other than Ethereum, check out our list of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now."

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum and one of the most vocal advocates of cryptocurrency, has a significant portfolio comprised mainly of ETH tokens. In fact, during the bull market in 2021, he became the world\u2019s youngest crypto billionaire. In the meanwhile, the price of ETH dropped significantly, but Vitalik Buterin\u2019s wealth is still substantial. So, how much is Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth today?\n\nVitalik Buterin and Ethereum\n\nTo better understand Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth, we first have to delve deeper into his relationship with the world\u2019s second most popular blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin is the inventor and co-founder of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain with an integrated smart contract functionality. Buterin first elaborated on the concept in a white paper in 2013, arguing that Bitcoin (back then, the sole relevant blockchain) lacked application development via an integrated scripting language.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and supporting decentralized applications (DApps). It utilizes its crypto tokens called Ether (Bitcoin ( is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and supporting decentralized applications (DApps). It utilizes its crypto tokens called ETH ) to execute transactions and run smart contracts. Unlike BTC ), which emerged as an alternative currency, Ethereum primarily aims to support fully decentralized contracts and apps to simulate a global virtual computer.\n\nRecommended video: Vitalik Buterin explains Ethereum\n\nSource: Ethereum YouTube\n\nThe idea failed to take off initially, but the Ethereum white paper circulated, the interest grew, and it finally caught up at a Bitcoin conference in January 2014, where it was described as a global processing machine operating on a decentralized network with virtually limitless applications. Ultimately, the project was crowdfunded and launched on 30 July 2015.\n\nFun fact: Vitalik Buterin\u2019s inspiration for decentralized money came from his Vitalik Buterin\u2019s inspiration for decentralized money came from his World of Warcraft gaming experience. He stated that Blizzard removed the damage component from his beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell one day. He cried himself to sleep, and on that day, he realized \u201cwhat horrors centralized services can bring\u201d and soon decided to quit.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH portfolio\n\nIn 2014, before it was publicly launched, Ethereum conducted a pre-sale where people could acquire Ether by paying with Bitcoin. ETH\u2019s initial token supply was over 72 million tokens, with 16.53% allocated to Vitalik Buterin and its other seven co-founders.\n\nThis initial batch of ETH is the source of most of his crypto portfolio and the most significant driver of Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth. As of August 1, 2024, Vitalik Buterin holds 245,178 ETH tokens. As the current price of each token is $3,188.82, this makes Vitalik Buterin\u2019s ETH portfolio total value equal to $781.83 million. In other words, Buterin\u2019s total value in held Ether is a little over $780 million.\n\nVitalik Buterin claims he never held more than 0.9% of total supply of Ether, and that was at the end of 2015. According to Arkham Intelligence, as of December 2023, the inventor of Ethereum held 0.2% of total ETH supply.\n\nI never personally held more than ~0.9% of all ETH, and my net worth never came close to $1b. Also, I'm pretty sure there are no criminal laws against pre-mining. \u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 10, 2018\n\nSince nearly all of it comes from Ether, Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth is highly dependent on the current price of the crypto coin. In November 2021, near ETH\u2019s peak price, the native token went over the $4,635 mark, making Buterin\u2019s net worth about $1.46 billion. Similarly, his future net worth will fluctuate according to the performance of his crypto invention.\n\nButerin\u2019s portfolio includes a number of other crypto tokens, but their combined worth amounts to a fraction of his ETH wealth and does not change the total net worth by much. Significant sums include 869,509 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) worth approximately $0.5 million, another 248,273 tokens or $0.85 million worth of WETH (WETH), about 250 trillion of Doge-Inu (DINU) worth $85,12, and small amounts sums of THE, USDC, INDSHIB, DOJO, and other tokens.\n\nButerin proposes radical innovations to boost Ethereum speed Although Ethereum has made significant advances over the years, it keeps lagging behind some of its competition \u2013 literally. Newer blockchains like Solana can generate blocks in 0.4 seconds, beating Ethereum\u2019s 12 seconds many times over.\n\n\n\nTo address this, Buterin has proposed radical new solutions, including the \u201csingle-slot finality (SSF)\u201d and \u201cbased pre-confirmations\u201d that would provide guaranteed inclusion of the transaction in the next block for an additional fee. Buterin has emphasized the need to balance network speed and integrity, but if successful, the changes could transform the crypto industry, likely increasing Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth in the process.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s non-crypto assets\n\nButerin was one of the earliest investors in StarkWare, an Israeli software tech company focused on cryptography, more precisely, zero-knowledge proof technology that focuses on blockchain scalability of the Ethereum platform. In May 2022, it was evaluated at $8 billion.\n\nAs there are few reliable sources and zero public data on Buterin\u2019s assets, it is impossible to know for sure how much his non-crypto portfolio adds to his total net worth. Therefore, we will not take it into account when calculating Vitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth in this article.\n\nAbout Vitalik Buterin\n\nBorn in Russia in 1994 and raised in Canada, the father of Ethereum showed exceptional skill in arithmetics and coding since his earliest years. He was the person to envisage how Ethereum should look and work and outlined the draft of its design in 2014, and the blockchain went live in 2015.\n\nRecommended video: Vitalik Buterin On Creating One Of The World\u2019s Largest Cryptocurrencies\n\nSource: Business Insider YouTube\n\nAs such, Ethereum expanded the capabilities of a blockchain from mere financial assets to a range of diverse functionalities in finance, gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. He has built a legacy of innovative thinking and decentralization advocacy, winning respect within the crypto and wider technology community.\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s net worth: the bottom line\n\nThe single asset that makes Vitalik Buterin wealthy is his stake in Ethereum, or the number of ETH tokens he holds and their combined value.
