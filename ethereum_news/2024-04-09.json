        "title": "What Are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) in Ethereum? - Unchained",
        "content": "When you create a new account in your Ethereum wallet, you are setting up an Externally Owned Account (EOA).\n\nEthereum has been at the forefront of decentralized applications and smart contract development. At the heart of user participation on the network lies a fundamental concept: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which are required to initiate any transaction. These accounts allow Ethereum users to send, receive, and manage their digital assets.\n\nKeep reading to learn what EOAs are and how they work\n\nWhat Are Externally Owned Accounts in Ethereum?\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are a type of Ethereum account controlled by users rather than code, as is the case with smart contract accounts. EOAs operate independently but can interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. They are also essential for initiating any transactions on the network.\n\nEOAs are controlled by an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) key, a cryptographic method for signing and verifying digital transactions. This process generates a private and corresponding public key, providing transaction security and authentication.\n\nEOAs have various purposes, such as sending and receiving transactions, managing ETH balances, and interacting with smart contracts.\n\nUsers interact with their EOAs and the Ethereum blockchain through wallets that allow them to manage the account\u2019s private keys. The underlying technology for EOAs functions similarly across different wallet types.\n\nSo when you create a new account in an Ethereum wallet, like MetaMask, you create an EOA.\n\nHow Do Ethereum EOA Accounts Work?\n\nEOAs can initiate transactions, send and receive ETH or Ethereum-based tokens (such as ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens), and interact with smart contracts. These accounts are commonly owned by average Ethereum users and interact with the blockchain through crypto wallets.\n\nExternally Owned Accounts have unique private keys, granting control over transaction signing. When users initiate a transaction or deploy a smart contract, they use their private key to sign the transaction, verifying their identity and authorizing the action.\n\nThe private key is then used to generate a corresponding public key that creates the account\u2019s Ethereum address.\n\nOnce verified, the transaction is made available on the Ethereum network, where it is validated and included in a block through the consensus mechanism. The transaction is now immutable and part of the blockchain\u2019s permanent and transparent record.\n\nEOAs are represented on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with an empty code string because they don\u2019t store smart contract data. Still, they hold balance information and transaction counts, which require storage on the blockchain.\n\nCreating an EOA itself incurs no direct blockchain transaction fee, but initiating transactions from it does attract gas fees. The network only recognizes an EOA\u2019s existence after its first transaction, and all transactions, including this first one, attract gas fees.\n\nEOA vs. Smart Contract Accounts: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nEOA accounts are user-controlled Ethereum accounts that require manual inputs for each action. On the other hand, smart contract accounts operate autonomously, executing code based on predefined rules within the blockchain.\n\nHere are more differences between EOA and smart contract accounts on Ethereum.\n\nCriteria EOAs Smart contract accounts Control EOAs are managed by private keys. Smart contract accounts are based on rules encoded within the blockchain. Creation EOAs are created through wallet interfaces, which generate a private key and a corresponding seed phrase applicable to both software and hardware wallets. A smart contract account is initiated when the associated smart contract deploys on-chain, incurring fees. Functionality EOAs are tools for transferring tokens and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum mainnet. Smart contract accounts incorporate programmable logic and advanced features for Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Gas fees EOAs need gas fees for mainnet transactions. Developers can design smart contracts to optimize gas usage, potentially reducing overall gas fees. Security EOAs rely primarily on user responsibility for security. Smart contract accounts allow users to combine multiple security layers, including authentication mechanisms and smart contract design best practices. Account Recovery EOAs don\u2019t support traditional account recovery methods due to the nature of blockchain technology. Account recovery is only possible in smart contract accounts.\n\nBenefits and Drawbacks of EOA Accounts\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOAs) are the foundation of user activity on the Ethereum blockchain and offer several benefits. However, they also have limitations.\n\nPros\n\nFull User Control: EOAs give users complete control over the account and its funds. Only the individual with the corresponding private key can manage the account and execute transactions.\n\nVersatile Transaction Initiation: EOAs have the flexibility to initiate any transaction on the Ethereum network, enabling users to interact with various decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nCons\n\nPrivate Key Dependency: EOAs rely heavily on the users\u2019 secure private key management. A lost or compromised private key could lead to the manipulation or loss of funds in an account.\n\nNative Token Dependency on Gas: Requiring users to maintain a balance of native tokens in their EOAs to cover gas fees can bring complexity and additional management tasks.\n\nFinal Take\n\nExternally Owned Accounts are used for standard transactions such as sending and receiving digital assets and managing ETH. As the Ethereum network continues to evolve and expand its capabilities, EOAs remain a foundational element that allows users to navigate various decentralized processes within the Ethereum ecosystem."

        "title": "Ethereum ETF Hopes Fade as SEC's Crypto Crackdown Dashes Approval Expectations - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFeeling bullish about a spot Ethereum ETF? Think again. According to issuers of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is unlikely to approve a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) anytime soon.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency globally, has been the subject of speculation for a spot ETF approval ever since SEC Chair Gary Gensler gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs applications in January.\n\nCompanies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, which issued spot Bitcoin ETFs, have been waiting in the wings for an Ethereum product, but now it seems that some are just testing the waters and are not entirely sure of a positive outcome.\n\nSpeaking at the Paris Blockchain Week crypto event this week, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck shared his pessimism about the chances of an Ethereum ETF approval.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the U.S., and we and [Ark Invest CEO] Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,\" he told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal.\n\nThe SEC has until late May to conclude its review of VanEck's Ethereum ETF, with other applications waiting in line all the way up to October.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which has long been considered to be a decentralized commodity, the official regulatory position regarding whether Ethereum is a security is not as clear. That\u2019s made things harder for ETH investors.\n\n\"I don't want to prejudge any one filing, '' Gensler told Yahoo Finance in March. He has been cautious not to give any concrete statement on the subject. But the CFTC has actually said at different times that it considers Ethereum to be a commodity\u2014which could potentially speed up the approval process should the SEC acknowledge its definition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti, also speaking to CNBC, shared his skepticism about gaining SEC approval for a proof-of-stake coin like Ethereum. \"I don\u2019t see anything being approved this side of the year,\" he noted.\n\nIn a proof-of-stake consensus model, blocks are confirmed not by miners but by stakers\u2014people holding large amounts of the native token (in this case, ETH) that they lock in the network. This fact\u2014which now is key for the operation of the Ethereum blockchain\u2014resembles the nature of a security in which large shareholders decide how a business works and get rewarded for their investments.\n\nThe approval of an Ethereum ETF would increase exposure to the cryptocurrency, allowing new investors to indirectly buy the coin and trade it. That also means potential Ethereum ETF issuers would need to have enough ETH in custody to cover a 1:1 trading volume\u2014which enthusiasts consider to be bullish as it can make on-chain ETH scarcer.\n\nWhile there are already some Ethereum futures ETFs approved, it does not guarantee that a spot ETF will receive the green light. There was a two-year gap between the first Bitcoin futures ETF and the first Bitcoin spot ETF approvals.\n\nThe first Ethereum futures ETFs were approved in 2023, so there may be a long road ahead before the first spot ETH ETF is launched\u2014 that is, of course, if history repeats itself.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

And so real stuff can be built on these databases now,\" he said. \"We're going to see that in the next couple of years.\""

        "title": "Restaking protocol EigenLayer heads to Ethereum mainnet - Blockworks",
        "content": "EigenLayer, the highly-anticipated Ethereum restaking protocol that has attracted billions of dollars worth of customer deposits, went to mainnet Tuesday afternoon.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s data availability solution, named EigenDA, also went live as an actively validated service (AVS) built on top of EigenLayer.\n\nThe launch came with training wheels of sorts, however, as critical components of EigenLayer are not set to go live until later this year.\n\nEthereum is secured by ether (ETH) that is staked, or pledged to earn yield in return for accurately verifying transactions. EigenLayer takes this a step further with restaking, which allows staked ETH be restaked and used to secure and run AVSs, which are various blockchain-based platforms built on EigenLayer.\n\nRead more: Restaking platform EigenLayer \u2018flips\u2019 Aave in TVL\n\nWith the mainnet launch, restakers can now delegate their restaked balance to EigenLayer operators, who can then run AVSs.\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has raced above $13 billion in the past few months, making it the second-largest DeFi protocol according to DeFiLlama. EigenLayer\u2019s offering of points for depositors, which some speculate will determine allocation in a future token, played a major part in the rapid growth.\n\nIt has also benefited from the popularity of liquid restaking tokens that restake deposits and issue liquid tokens in return, similarly to how Lido\u2019s stETH works.\n\nRead more: DeFi \u2018points\u2019 farming has reshaped the crypto investment landscape\n\nSome have expressed concerns over potential risks that could stem from restaking, which until now was a totally unproven model for Ethereum security.\n\nAny risk that EigenLayer could create \u201cfeels very systemic,\u201d Sebastian Higgs, chief operating officer of Cordial Systems, told Blockworks prior to the mainnet launch.\n\n\u201cIf there is an issue, the knock-on impact could be far reaching and so that\u2019s why I\u2019m proceeding very cautiously and I still have more questions than answers at this point,\u201d said Higgs.\n\nWhatever those risks may be, they aren\u2019t likely to surface quite yet. In an X thread announcing its mainnet, EigenLayer said it would allow its marketplace to \u201cdevelop and stabilize\u201d before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing later this year. In this case, slashing refers to an EigenLayer operator being financially punished for not adhering to rules set by an AVS.\n\nIf payments are enabled before slashing, operators and liquid restaking tokens would likely support every AVS, Ian Unsworth, co-founder of Kairos Research, told Blockworks. \u201c[B]ut once slashing gets implemented, we will see a \u2018de-leveraging\u2019 so to speak, as the stake gets re-delegated to reflect the actual risk.\u201d\n\nThe mainnet launch means some large venture bets will start to play out. A16z invested $100 million into Eigen Labs in February, adding to the $50 million it raised in early 2023. Multiple recently-funded startups are also teed up to become AVSs, including shared sequencer marketplace Espresso and restaked rollup provider AltLayer.\n\nRead more: Espresso lands $28M to become marketplace for shared sequencing\n\nElsewhere, investors have seemingly taken a liking to liquid restaking projects like ether.fi, which announced its $23 million Series A in February.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "title": "Ethereum spot ETF faces skepticism as SEC's decision looms - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "VanEck is bracing for a potential rejection.\n\nShare this article\n\nSeveral applications for spot Ethereum ETFs are pending SEC approval. As the decision date approaches, uncertainty grows, with financial and crypto leaders expressing a mix of skepticism and hope.\n\nA recent report from Barron\u2019s suggests an ongoing, frustrating situation for exchange-trade fund (ETF) issuers.\n\nAccording to Barron\u2019s, unlike the open dialogue that paved the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs, the conversation between the issuers and the SEC around Ethereum ETFs seems more one-sided. This lack of engagement foreshadows a rocky road for Ethereum ETFs.\n\n\u201cSome ETF issuers have met with the SEC to talk about their products, but so far, those discussions have largely been one-sided, without the agency giving the companies the critical feedback needed to finalize their products, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d wrote Barron\u2019s. \u201cAt this point in the Bitcoin ETF process, the issuers were already engaged in a robust back-and-forth with agency staff.\u201d\n\nWhile Barron\u2019s is skeptical, JPMorgan believes the question is \u201cwhen\u201d rather than \u201cif.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told The Block that a spot Ethereum ETF approval might still occur, but it would take longer than expected.\n\nAccording to him, ETF companies may initiate legal lawsuits against the agency if the SEC doesn\u2019t approve these filings. \u201cIf there is no spot Ethereum ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be a litigation process after May,\u201d said Panigirtzoglou.\n\nPanigirtzoglou suggested that the lawsuit will likely end up in opposition to the SEC, and just like what happened with Grayscale, the SEC would eventually be \u201cforced\u201d to approve spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nVanEck, one of the spot Ethereum fund issuers, projects an outright rejection of the ETF filings. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said in an interview with CNBC that the applications of VanEck and Ark Invest \u201care kind of the first in line for May\u2026to probably be rejected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and right now, pins are dropping as far as Ethereum is concerned,\u201d said van Eck.\n\n\u201c576 to one\u201d\n\nFor many fund managers, the SEC\u2019s lack of engagement is a nerve-wracking waiting game. BlackRock, however, might be more accustomed to this process.\n\nBlackRock has a history of 576 ETF approvals with only 1 rejection. This high success rate creates a positive outlook for the asset manager\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application.\n\nRecently, Ethereum has drawn attention after news that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation by an undisclosed state authority surfaced. Speculations suggest that this scrutiny, possibly from the SEC, aims to classify Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, as a security.\n\nDespite these speculations, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that a spot Ethereum ETF could still be possible even if ETH is classified as a security.\n\nJake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, suggested BlackRock\u2019s possible application for withdrawal. He noted BlackRock\u2019s history of successful ETF approvals is attributed to a collaborative approach with the SEC, not just forceful tactics.\n\n\u201cIf the SEC asks Blackrock and the other ETH ETF sponsors to withdraw (a common practice), I bet they will,\u201d commented Chervinsky."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn 2024\u2019s largest crypto raise so far, Monad Labs, the firm behind the upstart layer-1 network Monad, secured a whopping $225 million in funding on Monday from a round led by crypto venture juggernaut Paradigm.\n\nThe raise, which was also supported by crypto VC Electric Capital and the tech investment firm Greenoaks, constitutes a significant show of faith by crypto mainstays that Monad\u2014which has yet to launch\u2014will become a speedy, affordable, and dependable decentralized finance (DeFi) alternative to both the Ethereum ecosystem and layer-1 networks like Solana.\n\nFounded in 2022 by Jump Crypto alum Keone Hon, Monad is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network that is seeking to fill what is sees as a gap in the current crypto landscape: A blockchain able to easily interact with the Ethereum ecosystem, that is distinctly more capable of accommodating extremely high traffic while remaining speedy, cheap, and secure.\n\nThere are plenty of blockchains out there that would argue they already fit that criteria, to be sure. Following the landmark Dencun upgrade last month, Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have seen transaction costs plummet to near-zero. If any of those networks were to see massive upticks in usage, however, their gas fees would almost certainly spike.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNon-Ethereum layer-1 networks, particularly Solana, have ballooned in popularity in recent months\u2014particularly for DeFi users\u2014due to their speed and lower fees. But Solana has also suffered repeated outages as it attempts to scale to become a linchpin of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBy offering full capability with EVM\u2014the software that powers Ethereum, and all networks built on top of it\u2014Monad appears to be tapping into the dominant influence Ethereum has over crypto users and developers, while simultaneously attempting to build a more streamlined version of the network from the ground up.\n\nIt also looks like a play for attracting top-level developers. According to a January report from Electric Capital, some 90% of crypto developers working on multiple chains work with EVM.\n\nOther EVM-compatible layer-one networks are already out there, most notably Avalanche and BNB Chain, the latter of which was created by Binance. But Monad Labs\u2019 fundraise today marks the flashiest entry into the crowded blockchain ecosystem in some time\u2014certainly since the crypto crash of 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are excited about Monad because it solves one of the critical bottlenecks in scalability for the Ethereum ecosystem: the Ethereum Virtual Machine,\u201d Electric Capital Managing Partner Avichal Garg told Decrypt. \u201cMonad\u2019s parallelized EVM can unlock a 100x improvement in throughput in the EVM ecosystem and make consumer-grade, decentralized applications possible.\u201d\n\nPrior to today\u2019s news, Monad Labs previously raised a $19 million seed funding round in early 2023, led by Dragonfly Capital.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is winning the payments race, global investment firm AllianceBernstein declared today.\n\nFirm analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said in a Tuesday note that stablecoin use was growing again during the current bull market.\n\nSolana, the blockchain behind the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency, SOL, is leading the charge among stablecoins that are being used for cross-border payments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe big change this cycle has been the dominant market share of Solana (43% highest share) in value of stablecoins transferred vs. prior cycle market leader Ethereum,\u201d the report read.\n\nData from crypto data platform Artemis shows that as of yesterday, Solana\u2019s market share of stablecoins transferred stood at $63.6 billion of the $116.7 billion total. Ethereum came in second with $26.6 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ethereum still wins in terms of actual stablecoins on its blockchain by market cap\u2014but a lot of that capital is not being used.\n\nThe Bernstein report added that despite Solana\u2019s growth and overtaking Ethereum\u2019s market share for value transferred, the project still has a long way to go\u2014especially when it comes to scalability.\n\n\u201cFurther, scalability requirement for consumer payments would require 15-20 fold growth from here,\u201d the Bernstein analysts noted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite Solana being a fast blockchain, it has struggled with congestion issues as of late. Increasing user activity is putting strain on the network, and stakeholders are pondering on what to do to improve its usability.\n\nStablecoins are used in the crypto ecosystem to move around funds without the risk of them suddenly dropping or going up in value\u2014like assets Bitcoin and Ethereum do. Such coins and tokens are backed by something stable like the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies.\n\nThey run on a number of different blockchains: Ethereum, Tron, and Solana, being examples.\n\nSolana became hot again last year after payments giant Visa said it would use the blockchain\u2019s tech to speed up credit card payments. Then, Solana\u2019s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain.\n\nThis is likely why Solana is taking up so much of the market share of stablecoins moving around the crypto ecosystem compared to Ethereum.\n\nBut despite being used by the big names, the blockchain still hasn\u2019t broken into more mainstream consumer or B2B payments, the analysts noted.\n\nSome in the industry expected Solana to crash and burn because it was favored by convicted crypto criminal Sam Bankman-Fried and his now-collapsed FTX empire.\n\nBut the opposite happened and its market cap grew\u2014bringing SOL\u2019s price with it. The price of SOL now stands at $174.52, according to CoinGecko. It is still over 33% below its November 2021 all-time high of $259.96.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have both dipped as investors watch with trepidation for the next round of U.S. inflation data to be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that both BTC and ETH have seen gains compared to last week's not so great start to the month. In the past seven days, the Bitcoin price has gained 4.3% and the Ethereum price has gained 6.3%.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading just below $69,000 after losing 2.3% in the past day. And the Ethereum price\u2014which had been leading Bitcoin in gains earlier this week\u2014has lost 3.4% in the past 24 hours. ETH is currently changing hands for just over $3,500, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nBitcoin is now 9 days away from its next halving event, which will see the reward paid to miners cut from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC on April 20. Although the regularly scheduled anti-inflation measure is usually very bullish for Bitcoin, volatility leading up to it has spiked, with some traders arguing that any post-halving rally will be delayed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes predicted earlier this week that the crypto market will experience a \"raging firesale of crypto assets\" until at least May.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum community was just dealt a round of pessimism from spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. Speaking at the Paris Blockchain Week crypto event this week, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck said he's not confident there'll be much progress made this year.\n\n\"We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the U.S., and we and [Ark Invest CEO] Cathie Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected,\" he told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the event.\n\nA new entrant to the U.S. Bitcoin ETF space, CoinShares, shared a similar view. In March, CoinShares exercised its option to acquire the Valkyrie's ETF business\u2014including its Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund which trades on Nasdaq under the BRRR ticker.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti, also speaking to CNBC at the Paris event, shared his skepticism about gaining SEC approval for a proof-of-stake coin like Ethereum. \"I don\u2019t see anything being approved this side of the year,\" he said.\n\nEdited by Stephen Graves."

Both assets\u2014easily the two largest cryptocurrencies\u2014account for roughly 65% of the $2.7 trillion global market capitalization for digital assets.\n\nHigh inflation rates are bad news for crypto markets\u2014and stocks, for that matter\u2014because as long as inflation remains high, it is unlikely that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower federal interest rates. The longer interest rates remain high, the more it strengthens the case for traditional safe havens like treasury bonds over crypto assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe small bit of good news is that this morning's report isn't entirely unexpected, which should reduce volatility.\n\nAhead of this morning's announcement, analysts forecast that March data would show inflation had risen 3.4% compared to the same time last year. And the core CPI inflation rate, which leaves out volatile food and energy prices, was expected to drop from 3.8% to 3.7% over the same period.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said at a Stanford University event that he's confident the Fed won't raise rates in the near term. But he added that there's also no rush to reduce rates, either.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say whether recent inflation readings are more than just a bump,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released an update to its employment data last week, showing that payrolls had risen in March and the unemployment rate was relatively unchanged at 3.8%. The news was not well received in crypto markets, which slumped last week."

        "content": "Ethereum ETH/USD, the world\u2019s second-largest digital asset, has experienced an 8% surge in the last 24 hours, outperforming Bitcoin BTC/USD.\n\nWhat Happened: This sudden increase is believed to be connected to rumors about the possible approval of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the cryptocurrency, reported Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some chatter about Ether ETF issuers meeting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,\u201d said Edward Chin, co-founder of digital-asset hedge fund Parataxis Capital.\n\nInvestment powerhouses such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have lodged applications to initiate Ether ETFs. However, the regulator\u2019s approval of these applications remains uncertain.\n\nJames Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts, predict a 75% likelihood that the SEC will deny Ether applications by May. They refer to data that indicates relatively weak correlations between spot and futures markets.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing this article, Ether is currently trading at $3,690.58, marking a 7.57% increase over the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin surged 1.72% in the same time period. Moreover, the price has surged by 10.74% over the past 5 days, according to the data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nSee Also: Benzinga Bulls And Bears: Tesla, Apple, Meta And A 2013 Bitcoin Supporter Now Says \u2018Yes\u2019 To Shiba Inu\n\nWhy It Matters: The recent surge in Ether\u2019s value comes after a period of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. Earlier this month, both Bitcoin and Ethereum fell below key support levels, hinting at a potential shift in market sentiment.\n\nDespite this, optimism about the approval of Ether ETFs has been growing. Digital Finance Group CEO James Wo stated there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of such approval. This sentiment was echoed by JPMorgan, which remains hopeful about the SEC\u2019s eventual approval of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe speculation surrounding Ether ETFs has also led to a surge in the Bitcoin-Ether ratio, a key indicator in the cryptocurrency market, signaling caution amid the ongoing crypto rally.\n\nRead Next: \u2018We\u2019re F\u2019d,\u2019 Says \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad\u2019 Author Robert Kiyosaki Because Fed Chair Powell \u2018Finally Admitted Admitted Inflation Is Winning\u2019"

        "content": "Transitioning to Proof-of-Stake\n\n\n\nChallenges and Uncertainties for Web3\n\n\n\nThe Decentralization Dilemma\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead: A Web3 Future in Question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nBlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink has been quoted today in the media stating that even if Ethereum (ETH) is classified as a security, a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) might still be possible. The recent launch of several Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) was a positive step for the crypto industry, offering investors a clearer path to participate in the virtual digital asset class. This regulatory progress has fueled optimism within the crypto space, with many anticipating a similar green light for Ethereum ETFs in the near future.The success of Bitcoin ETFs, alongside the ongoing price rally, has undeniably instilled a sense of excitement about the potential of Ethereum and the broader blockchain landscape.Amidst these, the recent media reports about SEC reportedly investigating the Ethereum Foundation, coupled with the ongoing debate about Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether (ETH) \u2019s potential classification as a security, raises critical questions about the impact on Web3, the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem built on Ethereum's blockchain technology.Ethereum, conceived by the visionary Vitalik Buterin in 2013, introduced a revolutionary concept: a decentralized platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its impact has been profound, fueling the rise of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and a myriad of other innovations that comprise the Web3 industry.Previously Ethereum relied on a proof-of-work system to secure its network. Like in Bitcoin, in Ethereum computers competed to solve complex puzzles, with the winner earning newly minted Ethereum tokens. Every time a transaction is carried out on the Ethereum platform, one has to pay a gas fee or a transaction fee, irrespective of what the nature of that transaction might be. The gas fees previously were high, going up to $150 per transaction.To solve this problem and after years of testing to replace energy-intensive mining, Ethereum switched on its proof-of-stake mechanism in 2022. The new proof-of-stake system eliminated this competition. Instead, users \"stake\" their existing Ethereum holdings to validate transactions and earn rewards. This shift is estimated to have reduced Ethereum's energy consumption significantly. The ecosystem carried out another upgradation recently, called the Dencun upgrade, as a result of which transaction fees are expected to plummet to almost zero. Dencun achieves this by reducing rollup fees through the introduction of \"blobs,\" larger data packets that enable more efficient handling and storage of transaction-related information.Does staking constitute an investment contract, a key characteristic of a security?Since the transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, a debate among regulators and industry experts has sparked: could Ethereum's new model classify it as a security? The US SEC, for instance, in the past suggested this model could grant excessive control to the network's developers, potentially undermining its core tenet of decentralization.The potential classification of Ethereum as a security could have significant ramifications for the Web3 industry, raising critical questions about decentralization, regulation, and accessibility. It might lead to overly broad regulations, potentially impacting trading platforms, investor participation, and the overall market dynamics within the crypto space.Ethereum is the foundation for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 projects. These applications, ranging from DeFi to NFTs rely heavily on Ethereum's Layer2 Of late, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi ecosystem has experienced a significant resurgence, reaching a milestone of $100 billion, Ethereum leads the space with over 60% market share.A security designation for Ethereum could create regulatory hurdles for dApps built on its network, potentially stifling innovation and growth within the Web3 space.Decentralization is a core principle of Web3, aiming to create a more transparent and user-controlled internet experience. However, the SEC's potential classification of Ethereum as a security could centralize control, as exchanges may delist the asset or restrict trading for certain investors.The inherent decentralization of Ethereum, or for that matter any blockchain, presents a significant challenge to the potential enforcement of any forthcoming regulations. The ability of the SEC, or any national regulatory body, to effectively implement restrictions would be limited by the global nature of the crypto market.The ramifications extend beyond Ethereum itself, encompassing the broader crypto space. If Ethereum is classified as a security, it sets a precedent that could potentially impact other blockchains operating on similar principles.Currently, DeFi boasts 15 million daily transacting users, a number projected to surge to 100 million by 2025. The prospect of mass adoption of blockchain technology looms large, and the recent upgrades in Ethereum network were certain to incentivize developers to build even more innovative use cases. While regulations aim to protect investors, and rightly so, finding a balance between investor protection and fostering innovation will be crucial.As we confront these questions, one thing remains clear: navigating a new and innovative space like Web3 requires ongoing collaboration and a commitment to fostering responsible growth. Ethereum holds a significant place in the broader decentralized ecosystem and any such regulatory decision will have profound implications for the future of Web3 and shaping the next chapter of the digital revolution.(The author is Co-Founder, CoinDCX & Okto)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

        "content": "Amid a broader market recovery, Ethereum has shown strength, pumping over 7% today.\n\nMeanwhile, eco-friendly AI crypto eTukTuk is also outpacing the market, recently crossing the $2.8 million total raised mark.\n\nEthereum Jumps as Analysts Continued Gains\n\nEthereum is currently trading at $3.6K, up 7.6% today as it recovers from last week\u2019s sell-off. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is up by 4.6%, illustrating that ETH has outperformed other cryptos.\n\nHowever, analysts are bullish on the second-largest crypto, anticipating it could continue to surge in the coming months.\n\nETH has largely been overshadowed by SOL this year, up 95%, while SOL is up 787%. However, a recent mishap on Solana due to high network activity has damaged its user experience, with many transactions failing.\n\nAs such, Ethereum\u2019s Uniswap has overtaken Solana\u2019s leading DEX Jupiter in 24-hour trading volume after weeks of Jupiter\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis has impacted Solana\u2019s price performance against Ethereum, as evident on the SOLETH price chart.\n\nSOL\u2019s recent pullback against ETH creates a rejection of its macro resistance level, a bearish sign for SOL but bullish for ETH.\n\nProminent analyst Captain Faibik expects a bullish continuation for Ethereum. He predicts a move toward $4,800 and notes that \u201cEthereum hasn\u2019t hit an all-time high yet,\u201d a nod that Ethereum could catch up to Bitcoin, given that the market leader has already created an ATH this cycle.\n\nSimilarly, Jacob Canfield anticipates Ethereum will outpace Bitcoin on the four-hour chart.\n\n\u201cBTC made a massive push this morning to break range high resistance plus diagonal downtrend. But the real thing to watch is ETH, as it just put in a massive reversal candle on ETHBTC,\u201d he wrote.\n\nReed Carlson also foresees notable upside for Ethereum, noting that it currently trades at \u201cmacro range lows.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analyst also highlights the bullish implications for the broader altcoin market as Ethereum\u2019s price rises, speculating that \u201caltcoins are ready for a strong rally.\u201d\n\nAccording to analysts, one of the most promising emerging altcoins is eTukTuk. It is currently in its presale and could explode following its IEO.\n\nGreen AI Presale eTukTuk Raises $2.8M and Offers 94% Staking APY\n\nPresale cryptocurrency eTukTuk unlocks a new paradigm of innovative transportation, combining blockchain, AI, and electric vehicle technology into one protocol.\n\nWidely anticipated to be the next crypto to explode, analyst Jacob Bury recently dubbed it a \u201cNew 10x potential green AI crypto.\u201d\n\nThe project will strategically place AI-powered electric vehicles and charging stations in developing nations worldwide, starting with Sri Lanka.\n\nIn a display of commitment to its goal, eTukTuk has already partnered with Capital Maharaja Group, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest privately held company.\n\nAdding to its legitimacy, the eTukTuk team is doxxed and consists of well-versed specialists with experience across a slew of industries.\n\nThe project will integrate AI to ensure the efficiency and longevity of its vehicle fleet, helping with route optimization and predictive maintenance.\n\neTukTuk also boasts a Play-to-Earn game, which provides a high-octane way for users to generate rewards while bolstering the $TUK token\u2019s utility.\n\nIn a two-pronged approach to user rewards, the platform offers a staking mechanism, currently providing a 94% APY. However, this will decrease as more tokens are staked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the current presale price is $0.0295, but this will rise throughout the campaign, with the next uptick in two days.\n\nVisit eTukTuk Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin has seen its price jump by 16% since reaching its lowest point. Now, it is near the highest price it has been all year at $0.22. Some people who watch the market think this rise might not last, and the price could fall again.\n\nLooking at the price chart, Dogecoin has been doing quite well lately. It has been staying above $0.179, which is the growth threshold for the asset. If it can stay above this price level, we might see the rally continue, as it coincides with the point at which a reversal begins.\n\nDogecoin's future depends a lot on whether continue keep being interested in it. It has become popular before, especially with the help of social media and some famous people talking about it. But it is difficult to tell if it will keep being popular and if people will start to think it is not just for fun but also useful for other things.\n\nRight now, Dogecoin looks like it might be ready to try for its highest price this year. But people who want to invest should be careful. There are two important price levels \u2013 $0.155 and $0.11 \u2013 that could help stop the price from falling too much. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 59.97, which tells us that there is room for growth, but the fuel for it is yet to be found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum stays relevant\n\nEthereum is getting close to the $3,600 price, which has been tough for it to get past before. This time, Ethereum might just be able to push through.\n\nEthereum's price has gone up and down, testing how strong its support levels are and if the people buying (the bulls) can keep the price going up. The $3,600 mark is important because Ethereum has struggled to get past it before. Now, everyone's watching to see if it can finally do it.\n\nWhen we look at Ethereum's price chart, we can see it is really trying to get over the $3,600 mark. It looks like it is getting ready to make a big move up. There is a sign on the chart that if Ethereum can close above $3,600 solidly, the price might jump up.\n\nThe chart shows us some important prices that have helped Ethereum to not fall too much. One is at $3,474, and an even bigger one is at $3,056, which is where the 50-day moving average is. These prices are like a trampoline for Ethereum \u2014 they could help it bounce higher.\n\nWhat happens next for Ethereum might depend on if it can keep up the good work and get over the $3,600 hump. If it does, it could mean the start of a time when the price goes up even more.\n\nSolana stands out\n\nSolana is drawing attention for the wrong reasons. While other cryptocurrencies are gaining value, Solana's price is dropping. This is surprising to many because the overall mood in crypto is quite positive.\n\nPeople are now trying to understand why Solana is falling behind, and it looks like some technical problems with the network are to blame. These issues are causing transactions to fail because of too much traffic, and this has caused the outflow from the network.\n\nWhen we look at Solana's price chart, we notice that its value is around $184.02, which is lower than it has been at recently. This decrease might be related to worries about the network's transaction issues. These concerns have led to some uncertainty about when Solana will be able to sort out these troubles."

        "content": "In a recent analysis by renowned trader Alan Santana, Ethereum (ETH) is forecast to experience a 150% surge. The analysis predicts ETH to potentially reach an all-time high of $7,428.\n\nDespite the current market downturn, with ETH trading at $3,517.35, down 3.23% over the past 24 hours, Santana remains extremely bullish on the ETH/BTC trading pair.\n\nSource: Alan Santana (TradingView chart)\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Weekly Prediction: Can DOGE Surge 50% To Hit $0.3?\n\nThe provided technical analysis indicates that Ethereum\u2019s long-term growth potential is still intact. The chart indicates that if the support level, represented by the light orange line, holds, the ETH/BTC pair is expected to move higher.\n\nThis support level is crucial for maintaining the bullish momentum and setting the stage for the anticipated 150% surge.\n\nSantana emphasizes the importance of patience in this market, stating, \u201cPatience is key. We continue 100% bullish on ETHBTC. We keep the same market bias.\u201d\n\nEthereum forecasted to hit a new all-time high\n\nDespite the recent market volatility, with Ethereum\u2019s 24-hour trading volume at $15,889,812,762 and its price fluctuating between a low of $3,455.11 and a high of $3,643.03, Santana\u2019s analysis suggests that ETH is poised for a significant breakout. The trader\u2019s assertion of a 150% surge indicates that Ethereum could potentially outperform Bitcoin in the coming months.\n\nEthereum currently has a market cap of $422,264,036,523. The projected surge to $7,428 would represent a significant milestone for ETH.\n\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency: 3 Coins You Should Buy For The Bull Run\n\nThe analysis and projection come at a time when speculation of an ETH ETF approval is hovering around. With the expectation that Ethereum ETFs could soon hit the market, investors expect a notable surge for the coin. However, it is quite uncertain as to when the SEC could approve an ETH ETF."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nEthereum is making headlines in the second week of April 2024, accelerating past $3,700 on April 9. In the past seven days, the crypto has seen a 6.60 percent rise.\n\n\n\nAs of April 10, ETH trades around $3,500.\n\n\n\nNotably, the hikes noticed recently outpaced Bitcoin in growth percentages, even as the larger point remains that the two are by no means comparable and a smaller stride for Bitcoin holds equal, if not more, impact as compared to a larger step for Ethereum and other altcoins. In relevant news, Bitcoin has gained 4.46 percent in the past seven days.\n\n\n\nWhy the recent highs for Ethereum? The many factors include strong and optimistic market activities; further, the bullish momentum and rising volumes across the crypto markets have spurred on a higher degree of social activities, giving Ethereum its most recent boost.\n\n\n\nThere is also the matter of ETH derivatives. The Ethereum derivatives markets are overall signifying continued bullish trajectory for ETH in the rest of April. Notably, the upcoming significant market events include the fourth ever Bitcoin halving in just 9 days now, which has the potential to inject a great deal of crypto\u2019s infamous volatility across all assets. However, it seems the traders in the aforementioned derivates markets remain positive.\n\n\n\nThere is one remaining factor that may be fueling the ETH proponents in particular- the potential for one or more spot Ethereum ETFs in the US. Similar instruments for Bitcoin from renowned US-based financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have left their mark in the market already, pulling in institutional investors and boosting Bitcoin\u2019s price to a $70,000 support.\n\n\n\n10 of the major US spot Bitcoin ETFs cumulatively hold about 859,280 bitcoins as of April 9, 2024.\n\n\n\nWhile many expect Ethereum ETFs to have a similar impact on the mainstream journey of the crypto industry, some analysts remain skeptical of the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) actually giving such investment instruments a go ahead, especially as there\u2019s an ongoing probe on whether Ethereum is to be classified as a commodity or not.\n\n\n\nHowever, with consistent protocol updates, Ethereum is planning ahead, and the user excitement surrounding it is not likely to dim, regardless of the presence of a spot ETH ETF in the heart of global finance.\n\n\n\nShashank is the founder of yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist.\n\nTwitter: @bhardwajshash\n\n"

        "content": "Wed 10 Apr 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe crypto and financial industries are hopeful that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will rule in favor of a spot Ethereum ETF. However, some experts believe their hope may be in vain, as the chances of such a prospect coming to fruition seem to be dwindling. Here\u2019s why they are so pessimistic.\n\nThe Ambiguity of Ethereum\u2019s Crypto Status as a Key Obstacle\n\nWhile Bitcoin spot ETFs have gained some popularity, expectations for approval of a spot Ethereum ETF are facing a harsh reality. The prospects for a Spot Ethereum ETF seem to be growing dimmer.\n\nDuring the Paris Blockchain Week conference, Jan van Eck, CEO of asset manager VanEck, shared his pessimism about this possibility. He mentions the uncertainty surrounding the application submitted by the company he leads. But that is not the main reason for his doubts.\n\nThe head of Van Eck believes that unlike bitcoin (BTC), which is widely regarded as a decentralized commodity, the regulatory classification of ether (ETH) remains ambiguous. It is this lack of clarity that complicates the approval process for the highly anticipated Ethereum ETF.\n\nConsequently, he no longer rules out the possibility that the SEC may outright reject his company\u2019s Ethereum ETF application. Furthermore, an asset manager like Ark Invest, headed by Cathy Wood, whose application is expected to be reviewed in May, could also face the same fate.\n\nEthereum ETF Hopes Fade as SEC's Crypto Crackdown Dashes Approval Expectationshttps://t.co/wkMy2snmKh \u2014 John Morgan (@johnmorganFL) April 9, 2024\n\nLittle Enthusiasm Now for an Ethereum ETF\n\nJan van Eck\u2019s view is just an echo of an opinion that is increasingly spreading among crypto and financial industry players. Indeed, he is not the only one expressing doubts about the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nJean-Marie Mognetti, CEO of CoinShares, is of the same opinion. He has expressed his skepticism about obtaining the SEC\u2019s green light, contrary to what happened with Bitcoin in January. However, he does not outright dismiss this possibility.\n\nHe implied that approval might not materialize until the end of the year, even though he acknowledges concerns about Ethereum\u2019s consensus model, which relies on stakers rather than miners.\n\nIn short, the excitement around the emergence of a spot Ethereum ETF has given way to the industry players\u2019 doubts within a backdrop of regulatory hurdles. Knowing that the road to the approval of this instrument might prove to be tough and prolonged, investors and crypto players must arm themselves with patience while waiting for regulators\u2019 clarifications.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Tue 09 Apr 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nEthereum\u2019s cryptocurrency hits hard and fast, recording a dramatic 8% jump in just 24 hours. This soaring climb has propelled it toward the dizzying heights of $3,710 on Binance! But the climb doesn\u2019t stop there. Riding the wave of this week, the blockchain star has scaled an additional 3.0%. This has boosted its value from $3,510.48 to new heights. Although still below its record of $4,878.26, Ethereum displays an unwavering determination to redefine the limits of its potential.\n\nThe Wings of Cryptocurrency Volatility and the Whisper of Millions\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the heart-pounding volatility of Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency. The Bollinger Bands, like graphic roller coasters, show us a landscape of fluctuations.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Bollinger Bands tell the thrilling story of its volatility.\n\nThese wide gray bands, stretching the chart, are the stage for a frenetic dance, oscillating with the moods of the crypto market.\n\nLast week saw ETH cryptocurrency playing the tightrope walker, navigating with remarkable ease the stretched thread of volatility. But what does this dance of numbers tell us? That behind every spike, every dip, lies a story of optimism, fears, expectations, and above all, opportunities.\n\nAs shown by CoinGecko, within this financial ballet, another figure attracts attention : a 21.0% increase in trading volume of ETH crypto.\n\nThe circulating supply does not remain on the sidelines, showing a modest growth of 0.31% to reach 120.07 million.\n\nThese figures, beyond their apparent coldness, whisper the story of growing adoption, of bolstered confidence.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $436.18 billion, Ethereum\u2019s cryptocurrency sits proudly in second place, and it\u2019s not just a number. It\u2019s a reflection of a belief, that of investors betting on the future of revolutionary technology.\n\nA Digital Demographic Explosion\n\nAnd then, March arrived, bringing with it a significant surge in the creation of new Ethereum addresses.\n\nNo fewer than 3.66 million freshly minted addresses have been recorded, an increase of nearly 40% from February. These numbers, worthy of a science fiction novel, have not been seen since the tumultuous days of November 2021.\n\nThis leads us to reflect: behind each address, there is a bet on the future, a slice of dream within the digital ecosystem of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum\u2019s cryptocurrency takes off, and with it, thousands of investors, developers, enthusiasts. It\u2019s not just about numbers, gains, and losses. It\u2019s a story of vision, of blockchain technology pushing the boundaries of what is possible. With Ethereum, we\u2019re not at the end of a chapter, but at the dawn of a new era, full of promises and innovations.

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies Other Than Bitcoin to Buy Ahead of the Halving - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ethereum and Solana stand out as potential cryptos that could soar in value after the Bitcoin halving.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin (BTC -1.80%) halving just two weeks away, crypto investors are lining up to buy Bitcoin. This makes sense, given the historical correlation between halving events -- when the reward for mining the crypto is cut in half -- and Bitcoin price gains. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen in 2024.\n\nSo, buying Bitcoin ahead of the halving is basically a no-brainer at this point. But are there other cryptocurrencies that could also see a price spike after the halving? By analyzing a few key metrics, it's possible to come up with a short list of potential investment prospects. Let's dig in.\n\nFavorites of institutional investors\n\nGiven that there are more than 20,000 cryptocurrencies in the world, we need a quick, easy way to narrow down potential investment targets to a short list of high-quality names. As a general rule of thumb, we're looking for cryptos that are seeing strong interest from institutional investors.\n\nThe good news is that it is possible to narrow the list of potential investment targets significantly since most institutional investors are not interested in cryptos with less than a $2 billion market cap. That shrinks the list of 20,000 potential cryptocurrencies to a pool of about 50. While not all of these cryptos may be household names, they all have significant upside potential if institutional investors decide to load up on them.\n\nWe can go one step further by looking at where institutional investors are actually moving their money. CoinShares, for example, produces a Weekly Crypto Asset Flows report showing inflows and outflows for the top cryptocurrencies. Since the flows are tracked weekly, monthly, and year to date, it's possible to see which cryptos are gaining or losing momentum with investors.\n\nBased on the most recent CoinShares numbers, only five cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin seem to be garnering any sort of interest this year: Ethereum (ETH -1.33%), Solana (SOL 0.14%), Litecoin (LTC -1.57%), XRP (XRP 4.62%), and Polkadot (DOT -2.28%). You can think of these as the five favorites of institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin correlations\n\nNext up, we'll want to look at a cryptocurrency correlations matrix to see which of these five cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with Bitcoin. The logic here is simple: If we expect the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket after the halving, then we want cryptocurrencies that can go along for the ride and capture the maximum potential upside. The higher the correlation, the more upside they should be able to capture.\n\nWhile all cryptocurrencies are correlated with Bitcoin to some degree, given that they are all part of the same asset class, some have historically shown very high correlations. Of our potential list of five cryptocurrencies, three particularly stand out: Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. For example, Ethereum has a 0.82 correlation with Bitcoin, Polkadot has a 0.73 correlation, and Solana has a 0.67 correlation. By way of comparison, XRP has only a 0.44 correlation, while Litecoin has a 0.61 correlation.\n\nAnd the two winners are...\n\nAs a final filter, we'll want to focus on Layer 1 blockchain networks, which are the building blocks of the blockchain world. Of the three remaining cryptos on our list, only Ethereum and Solana make the cut. These two Layer 1 blockchains are well diversified and do a little bit of everything, from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming to decentralized finance (DeFi). As such, they are best positioned to benefit from mainstream crypto adoption.\n\nPolkadot, alas, is what crypto enthusiasts refer to as a Layer 0 blockchain -- it's not so much a blockchain to build on top of as it is a sort of connecting glue for other blockchains. I've always viewed Polkadot as a way of hedging your bets if you're confident about the future growth of blockchain technology but not confident enough to actually predict a final winner.\n\nWith that in mind, my two winners are Ethereum and Solana. If you favor stability and a proven track record that extends back to 2015, Ethereum is the clear choice. If you favor innovation potential and long-term future upside, Solana is your pick. Either way, both cryptos should be on your investment radar ahead of the Bitcoin halving."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF approval odds have dropped below 25% in Polymarket.\n\nVijay Boyapati forecasts ETH ETF May rejection could benefit BTC.\n\nThe overall market is leaning toward a possible US spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF applications rejection in May.\n\nAccording to the prediction markets platform, Polymarket, the bets for ETH ETF May approval have dropped 68% and stood at a 24% chance at press time.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, who correctly predicted the US spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF approval, have echoed Polymarket\u2019s sentiment.\n\nIn a recent post on X, Seyffart highlighted SEC\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d and \u201cno feedback\u201d to recent ETH ETF filings as \u201cviolence\u201d to clients.\n\n\n\n\u201cEric said \u201cSilence is Violence\u201d on a client call last week in regards to the #ethereum ETFs and I loved it.\u201d\n\nSeyffart was reacting to Balchunas\u2019 statement that SEC wasn\u2019t giving \u201ccritical feedback\u201d even during in-person meetings. This meant that odds for May approval were still low.\n\nWill BTC benefit from Ethereum ETF May rejection?\n\nWith May fast approaching and approval odds seeming elusive, Vijay Boyapati, commentator and author of \u201cThe Bullish Case for Bitcoin,\u201d claimed that,\n\n\u201cAll the hot money that flowed into ETH because of ETF hopium is going to go back into Bitcoin once the Ethereum ETFs are all rejected.\u201d\n\nFor Boyapati\u2019s prediction to happen, ETH market dominance will need to drop considerably as BTC\u2019s surge.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, BTC\u2019s market dominance was 52.4% at the time of writing, mainly due to strong ETF flows in the past three months. ETH\u2019s market dominance stood at 16.5%.\n\nShould Boyapati\u2019s thesis be confirmed, ETH market dominance could slip below 16% or 15% as the market re-adjusts to ETH ETF rejection in May. If so, the capital rotation could induce BTC momentum.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH was above a crucial weekly bearish order block (3.2K\u20143.5K). It was consolidating around the Q1 2022 local top. A slump below 3.2K could cause bears to overwhelm the market, especially if ETH ETF applications are rejected."

This surge in price coincided with an increase in exchange inflow as Alameda seized the opportunity to capitalize on its holdings.\n\nAlameda dumps more Ethereum\n\nRecent data tracked by Spot on Chain revealed that Alameda Research of FTX deposited Ethereum to the Coinbase exchange. The data indicated that Alameda deposited 4,000 ETH, valued at around $14.7 million when ETH was trading at approximately $3,688.\n\nThis deposit marked the first significant move by Alameda since February, coinciding with a rally in ETH prices.\n\nFTX and Alameda have deposited over 21,000 ETH, amounting to more than $72 million. Alameda\u2019s recent move mirrors the pattern observed in the market on 8th February, characterized by a significant influx of ETH into exchanges.\n\nTraders take advantage of the Ethereum rally\n\nThe Exchange Netflow data analysis revealed that Ethereum experienced its highest exchange flow for the month on 8th April. Moreover, the analysis indicated that ETH inflow predominated the flow, indicating that more traders were depositing their holdings onto exchanges.\n\nThe chart displayed over 45,000 ETH deposited into these exchanges on 8th April, suggesting that, like Alameda, other traders took advantage of the ETH price rally.\n\nHowever, there was a reversal in the flow at the time of writing, with more outflow recorded. Over 35,000 ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges thus far. This movement could be attributed to the slight pullback in ETH\u2019s price at the time of writing.\n\nETH sees 1% decline\n\nOn 8th April, Ethereum witnessed a significant surge, marking its largest increase in some time. Analysis of the daily timeframe chart revealed a nearly 7% rise, with ETH closing at approximately $3,694.\n\nConcurrently, the volume chart depicted a substantial increase in ETH volume, exceeding $19 billion as its price surged.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH\u2019s price had experienced a slight decline of over 1%, yet it remained within the $3,600 region.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nDespite this decline, Ethereum maintained its current bull trend, as indicated by its Relative Strength Index.\n\nAdditionally, analysis of its volume indicated an uptick. At the time of this writing, the volume was over $20 billion, reflecting ongoing market activity and investor interest in Ethereum."

        "title": "Ethereum Electra Upgrade: Here Are The 4 Code Changes Embedded - CoinGape",
        "content": "The next consensus layer-focused hardfork coming to Ethereum is the Electra upgrade and developers have been busy reinforcing the upgrade with certain EIPs that offer specific functions. The 4 key EIPs were teased by Galaxy Researcher Christine Kim.\n\nEthereum Electra Upgrade Sees Multiple Implementation\n\nThe Ethereum Electra protocol is billed to go live on the testnet very soon. From discussions held during the last All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) bi-weekly meeting spearheaded by Ethereum Foundation (EF) Researcher Alex Stokes, Ethereum developers are integrating EIP 6110, EIP 7002, EIP 7251 and EIP 7549 into the Electra upgrade.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo far, these are the 4 code changes going into Electra \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n-EIP 6110 (Supply validator deposits on chain)\n\n-EIP 7002 (Execution layer triggerable exits)\n\n-EIP 7251 (Increase the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE)\n\n-EIP 7549 (Move committee index outside attestation) pic.twitter.com/XXfYkkvCO2 \u2014 Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) April 9, 2024\n\nEIP 6110 which was created as far back as December 2022, is poised to supply validator deposits on-chain. According to the Ethereum Foundation (EF), \u201cThis EIP allows for an in-protocol mechanism of deposit processing on the Consensus Layer and eliminates the proposer voting mechanism utilized currently.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, the EIP 6110 will contribute to improving Ethereum\u2019s security and stability by changing the way that the network processes its validators\u2019 deposits.\n\nEIP 7002 can also be referred to as the Execution layer triggerable exits. It would allow validators to trigger exits via their execution layer (0x01) withdrawal credentials. There are still considerations from developers to make minor adjustments to this EIP that will equally trigger a change in Engine API.\n\nEIP 7251 is tagged \u201cIncrease the MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE\u201d as it aims to allow validators to have larger effective balances while maintaining the 32 ETH lower bound. Noteworthy, EIP 7002 is a prerequisite for this EIP, hence, there are speculations that the implementation of EIP 7002 and 7251 in the same upgrade will trigger some complexities.\n\nDeveloper\u2019s Concern Highlighted\n\nFor EIP 7251, Lighthouse developer \u201cethDreamer\u201d coined two questions of concerns that would need to be addressed before the implementation. First, he is concerned about whether custom ceilings for partial withdrawals for validators with an effective balance greater than 32 ETH will be included.\n\nSecondly, he wants to know if consolidation of validators as a CL or EL-initiated operation should be enabled. Answers to these questions are expected from the next Ethereum developers\u2019 breakout meeting.\n\nEIP 7549 moves the committee index outside of the signed Attestation message. This is one of the most recently created EIPs.\n\n\u201cThis proposal aims to make Casper FFG clients more efficient by reducing the average number of pairings needed to verify consensus rules. While all types of clients can benefit from this EIP, ZK circuits proving Casper FFG consensus are likely to have the most impact,\u201d a statement from EF detailed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is undergoing intense evolution and Electra Upgrade is the next major after Dencun Upgrade which went live on the mainnet earlier this year.\n\nGodfrey Benjamin Linkedin Benjamin Godfrey is a blockchain enthusiast and journalists who relish writing about the real life applications of blockchain technology and innovations to drive general acceptance and worldwide integration of the emerging technology.

        "content": "The weekly transaction volume of Tether (USDT) on Tron hit $110 billion in the first week of April, signaling heightened stablecoin activity on the network.\n\nAccording to a tweet by IntoTheBlock, Tether\u2019s latest milestone on Tron was 2x the amount the stablecoin settled on Ethereum. This indicates that Tron has maintained its position as the leading network for USDT transactions.\n\nUSDT Records $110B Volume on Tron\n\nIntoTheBlock attributed high USDT transactions on Tron to the network\u2019s low fees, saying that the blockchain has allowed users to access the United States dollar-backed asset easily.\n\nLast month, CryptoPotato reported that USDT transaction volume on Tron was rising to peak levels seen in January 2023. The stablecoin averaged roughly two million transactions daily on the network, an increase that began in February.\n\nTether\u2019s market cap recently hit $100 billion, strengthening the asset\u2019s dominance in the stablecoin space. While the stablecoin is available on 15 blockchains and protocols, a significant portion of its supply is on the Tron network.\n\nEarlier this year, Reflexivity Research discovered that roughly 94% of the stablecoin total value locked on Tron belongs to USDT. The dominance also extended to Tron smart contracts, for which USDT accounted more than 95%. The USDT contract consumes a large part of the on-chain energy, indicating that the asset was used for stablecoin transactions with limited diversification.\n\nUSDT Linked to Illicit Activities\n\nAs USDT expands its presence on Tron, so do illicit activities on the network. An analysis by blockchain forensics firm TRM Labs revealed that Tron accounted for 45% of illegal transaction volume in 2023, ahead of Ethereum and Bitcoin, which were responsible for 24% and 18%, respectively.\n\nTron has become the favored network of cyber criminals, North Korean hackers, terrorist financiers, and drug sellers due to its low gas fees and minimal price fluctuations. These criminals frequently exchange their stolen and illicit crypto assets, mainly for USDT, on Tron before they are laundered for over-the-counter trades.\n\nThe rising use of USDT for illicit activities has attracted scrutiny from several regulators. In January, a United Nations report even identified the stablecoin as a vehicle for money laundering and scams in Southeast Asia. However, USDT issuer Tether expressed disappointment at the UN\u2019s claims, insisting that the report only focused on the asset\u2019s alleged connection to illicit activities and not its positive impact."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s futures open interest show that the coin will reclaim its all-time high in the mid-term.\n\nIts key indicators also confirmed the rise in bullish sentiment in the coin\u2019s spot market.\n\nLeading coin Ethereum [ETH] may be poised for another significant rally in the mid-term, pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC noted in a new report.\n\nThe report assessed the coin\u2019s futures market and found that despite the general market consolidation in March, ETH\u2019s funding rates have remained positive, and its open interest has continued to climb.\n\nFunding rates are used in perpetual futures contracts to ensure that the contract price stays close to the spot price.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s contract price is higher than its spot price, traders who hold long positions pay a fee to traders shorting the asset. Funding rates return positive values when this happens.\n\nConversely, when the contract price is lower than the spot price, short traders pay a fee to traders holding long positions, leading to negative funding rates.\n\nAccording to the analyst, as ETH attempts to reclaim the $4,000 price mark, there has been a \u201ccorresponding spike in the funding rates metric.\u201d\n\nThe report added,\n\n\u201cThis indicates an aggressive execution of long positions by participants.\u201d\n\nCoinglass data showed that the coin\u2019s funding rate was a positive 0.024% at press time. When an asset\u2019s funding rate is positive and grows, more traders hold long positions. This means more market participants are expecting the asset\u2019s price to rise in the short/mid-term than those anticipating a decline.\n\nRegarding the coin\u2019s futures open interest, its double-digit price rally in the past week has caused this also to grow. Per Coinglass data, ETH\u2019s futures open interest was $15 billion as of this writing. In the last seven days, this had grown by 7%.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\n\u201cConsidering these metrics, the market appears poised for another significant move in the mid-term, with the potential for long positions to be reinstated in the perpetual market. This suggests a favourable outlook for Ethereum\u2019s price trajectory, potentially pushing it towards its all-time high.\u201d\n\nAre the bulls regaining their strength?\n\nMarch was significantly marked by bearish sentiments, which caused ETH\u2019s price to consolidate within a tight range.\n\nHowever, readings from some indicators observed on a 1-day chart showed that the rally in the coin\u2019s price in the last week confirmed that the bulls are now attempting to re-enter the market.\n\nFor example, for the first time since 15th March, ETH\u2019s MACD line rested above its signal line.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s MACD line crosses above its signal line, it suggests that its shorter-term moving average is starting to move upward quicker than its longer-term moving average. This indicates an increase in bullish momentum in the short term.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAlso, ETH\u2019s Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed that its positive directional index (green) crossed above its negative index (red) on 7th April.\n\nThis confirmed the change in sentiment from bearish to bullish."

        "content": "Historical design shown by the MVRV ratio, led ETH to bounce.\n\nWhile traders booked some profits, the OI indicated that more was close.\n\nOn the 8th of April, Ethereum [ETH] defied the school of thought that it was a slow move this cycle as its market cap jumped by over 9%. This increase placed its market cap at over $440 billion.\n\nDuring this time, the altcoin\u2019s price surpassed $3, 700 before its slight drop. But that was not the major highlight.\n\nThe past is sometimes the present\n\nAMBCrypto analyzed Ethereum\u2019s on-chain condition and observed the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This ratio provides insights into traders\u2019 buying and selling behavior. It can also help to spot the bottoms and tops of an asset.\n\nBetween the 1st and 7th of April, ETH\u2019s 30-day MVRV ratio was negative, suggesting an unusual buying opportunity in the region. This prediction was based on the cryptocurrency\u2019s history.\n\nFor instance, the ratio was -4.90 in October 2023 while ETH changed hands at $1,566. Weeks later, the price crossed $2,000. A similar scenario also occurred in January as ETH moved from $2,237 to $4,088.\n\nOn both occasions, the price increased by 21.7% and 45.27% respectively. This time, Ethereum has only increased by 7.89%. Should the historical pattern repeat itself, the price could rally toward $4,648 over the next few weeks.\n\nBut that might only be the case if the market does not experience extreme volatility that could cause prices to nosedive. If this is the case, then the bullish prediction might be invalidated.\n\nIs it time for surplus gains?\n\nIn the meantime, traders took advantage of the price increase to realize some profits. This was something that ETH holders could not boast of in recent weeks.\n\nA look at the daily on-chain transaction volume in loss showed that it was $129,000. On the other hand, the on-chain transaction volume in profit was about 238,000.\n\nIf the price of the cryptocurrency continues to increase, then the volume in profit could be double those in the red. But will Ethereum give in to the rally?\n\nTo ascertain this possibility, AMBCrypto looked at the Open Interest (OI). According to data from Coinglass, ETH\u2019s OI jumped to $14.41 billion.\n\nOI measures traders\u2019 activity based on net positioning. If the OI decreases, it implies an increase in positions closed. On the other hand, an increase in the metric suggests a surge in liquidity added to open positions.\n\nTherefore, the increase in the last 24 hours meant that more contracts had been opened, with buyers being the aggressive ones.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nLooking at ETH\u2019s price and the OI, it seems that the convergence might trigger a significant price movement.\n\nFrom a trading perspective, the large OI alongside the rising value might lead to a breakout. Should this be the case, ETH\u2019s rise above $4,000 could be next."

        "content": "Ethereum has seen significant consecutive increases in the past 48 hours.\n\nWhales have bought over $70 million worth of ETH within 24 hours.\n\nOn 7th April, Ethereum experienced its highest returns for the month. This positive uptrend coincided with a recent increase in the volume bought by certain whales.\n\nAdditionally, it occurred while the network\u2019s overall volume remained relatively stable, with Layer 2 (L2) solutions handling most of the transactions.\n\nEthereum increased by 7%\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum daily timeframe chart revealed that on 7th April, it closed trading with an increase of over 3%, reaching above $3,400. This price trend was notable because Ethereum had experienced significant declines before, making this the first major uptrend observed.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, Ethereum was experiencing an even larger uptrend with over a 4% price increase. The chart indicates that ETH was trading above $3,600 with this recent surge.\n\nObserving the chart, it was noted that the highest point reached this year was around $4,000. Given the current trend, surpassing this record in the coming weeks is possible.\n\nFurthermore, a study of the chart revealed that the price rise effectively reinstated Ethereum into a bull trend. Data from its Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated that ETH was now above the neutral zone, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nWhales mop up more Ethereum\n\nAs the Ethereum price continues upward, recent data showed increased buying activity from certain whales. According to Spot on Chain, within the last 24 hours, two whales collectively spent over $35 million to purchase ETH.\n\nSpecifically, these whales acquired 10,322 ETH at an average price of around $3,400.\n\nAdditionally, as the price climbed to approximately $3,455, two more whales withdrew 11,657 ETH, valued at over $40 million, from an exchange. This movement by the whales suggests heightened accumulation, likely in anticipation of further price appreciation.\n\nMore cash flows into ETH\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum Open Interest trend on Coinglass indicates a recent decline over the past few days. However, there was a slight uptick at the time of writing, with over $13.3 billion in open interest observed.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis suggests that more capital was flowing into Ethereum, potentially acting as a catalyst for further price increases.\n\nWhen considering the current behavior of whales and the uptick in Open Interest, key metrics display positive signs, indicating that a new price level may be imminent."

Before the surge, over $35 million in ETH has been acquired by crypto whales, pushing the price above $3,400 on Monday.\n\nTaking advantage of the Surge, Alameda Research, tied to the defunct FTX, has been very active in the Ethereum market.\n\nReports from Spot on Chain indicate a notable 4,000 ETH ($14.75 million) deposit by Alameda to Coinbase, the largest since a major rally in February.\n\nThe transfer to a centralized exchange like Coinbase indicates that the crypto firm has intentions to sell Ethereum.\n\nAlameda Research\u2019s wallets still retain substantial Ethereum assets, with $64 million in Wrapped ETH (WETH) and ETH.\n\nAccording to experts, the large deposit by Alameda Research poses a complex situation for Ethereum. The deposit happened in a critical period with impending regulatory approvals and market movements set to significantly determine Ethereum\u2019s trajectory.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nEthereum is the largest Altcoin by price and market cap. Its current Price is $3,680 with a market capitalization of $442.82 billion.\n\nEthereum accounts for over 17% of the total $2.49 trillion market capitalization of all crypto currency assets.\n\n1 Ether is currently worth N4.480 million"

        "title": "Ethereum\u2019s Price Correction Might Not Sustain As Accumulation Increases! Here\u2019s The Next ETH Price Level - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "As Bitcoin again gained momentum ahead of the halving event, the market is facing increased accumulation from whale investors. As a result, Ethereum has triggered notable surges as it regained its buying demand. Interestingly, several on-chain metrics for ETH have now turned bullish and are defending the ongoing correction on the price chart, aiming to send the ETH price toward resistance channels.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Defends Price Correction\n\nAfter the BTC price rallied toward $72K, Ethereum witnessed its price surpassing the $3.7K level in no time, resulting in a massive short-liquidation. However, since the Dencun Upgrade in mid-March, Ethereum\u2019s price has struggled to climb back over the $4,000 mark, facing a sharp sell-off.\n\nHowever, with the Bitcoin halving event approaching in less than 10 days, Ethereum traders are showing a notable uptick in leverage use. On April 8, Ethereum\u2019s price saw a 7% increase, sending the leverage ratio to 0.29%, a peak not seen in the past 45 trading days since February 25. This surge in leverage during an uptrend indicates that traders are increasingly borrowing to enhance their positions, betting on Ethereum\u2019s continued rise.\n\nIn the past few hours, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has been dropping significantly. Coinglass reports that there has been nearly $21 million worth of long liquidations in the last four hours alone. Despite the drop, there\u2019s a noticeable increase in accumulation from holders as data from IntoTheBlock indicates that the Netflow metric dipped into the negative region, reaching -17.75K ETH. This suggests that more ETH is being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited, particularly after the price of ETH surged above $3,600.\n\nThis behavior is somewhat unusual during a surge, as holders typically deposit more ETH when they intend to sell, rather than withdrawing it. However, this could potentially strengthen the support levels for ETH\u2019s price, making it challenging for sellers to plunge the price.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nBulls failed to hold the price above $3,700 level as sellers defended the resistance level strongly and plunged the price below immediate Fib channels. ETH price is currently declining heavily and is aiming for a retest of the $3,400 level. As of writing, ETH price is trading at $3,506, declining over 3.4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe ETH/USDT pair has dropped below the crucial mark of $3,500, warranting close attention. Should sellers successfully hold the price below this barrier, the pair may gain bearish momentum, potentially rallying towards $3,200-$3,300. However, anticipation persists for a bullish comeback at this level as a rebound above the EMA trend line might send the price to retest $3,700.\n\nIf ETH price successfully breaks above $3,700, it will trigger increased purchasing power, resulting in a jump toward $4K. A successful consolidation might strengthen confidence, resulting in further surges for ETH price toward $4,500."

The commission will decide on the matter by May, and it is highly likely that it will delay the decision.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), has rallied by more than 60% in 2024 amid the growing ETF speculations, including a 10% jump in the past week.\n\nETH/USD Price Surge: Tracking the Rally on CoinGecko\n\nEthereum\u2019s Switch to Staking Complicated ETF Decision\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has emphasized that the agency views \u201cthe vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus fall under federal securities laws,\u201d albeit without mentioning Ethereum. Nonetheless, most cryptocurrencies that the SEC may deem as securities are proof-of-stake (PoS), a protocol that offers interest rate returns to people for their contribution to running a blockchain network.\n\nRelated: Is Buying Ethereum Too Risky Against SEC\u2019s Potential Crackdown?\n\nThis stance complicates the situation for an Ethereum ETF, given it recently changed its underlying consensus protocol to PoS. Meanwhile, CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti told CNBC on April 9 that they are observing the SEC\u2019s approach toward Ethereum \u201cvery closely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect any approvals to come before the end of this year,\u201d he remarked, hinting at the challenges of securing SEC approval for proof of stake, a protocol unique to blockchain technology."
