        "title": "MIT grads\u2019 $25 million crypto crime puts spotlight on Ethereum front-running - Fortune",
        "content": "If you graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with elite computer skills, you can make great money working for a tech company\u2014or even more money working on Wall Street. But if that doesn\u2019t grab you, and you want to get even richer, you can always try your hand at white-collar crime like twentysomething brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno. The pair came up with a scheme that let them pocket $25 million in just 12 seconds. Unfortunately, it ended badly, as the feds announced yesterday in a press release that reads like a pulp novel.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents,\u201d wrote the DOJ. For good measure, the release quotes an agent who declares the crime was solved \u201cwith cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work.\u201d\n\nPurple prose aside, the case involves some impressive detective work as well as a sophisticated explanation by Justice Department lawyers of a new type of alleged crime involving the Ethereum blockchain. The crime involves the arcane business of \u201cMaximum Extractable Value,\u201d or MEV, which entails packaging transactions in a block in a way that allows those who construct the blockchain to profit from others\u2019 transactions.\n\nThe miners who build blockchains do not, of course, do this out of the goodness of their hearts. Instead, the process relies on incentives that allow miners\u2014in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains\u2014to obtain a reward in the form of both coins and transaction fees for adding a new block. When Ethereum switched to a new blockchain construction process known as proof-of-stake, however, it created new opportunities for miners to make money\u2014including by front-running trades included in the blocks they package. This is what people mean by MEV. (Bitcoin investment firm River, as well as the DOJ\u2019s criminal indictment, has a good explanation of how exactly it works).\n\nMEV has been around for a while now, and while a number of people in crypto find it distasteful, it is not illegal\u2014and indeed, similar things go on in the world of traditional finance such as the practice known as payment for order flow. The Peraire-Bueno brothers, however, took things a step further when they detected a bug in a popular piece of software used to carry out MEV. This allowed them not to simply front-run Ethereum users\u2019 transactions, but to tamper with them in a way that allowed them to outright rob them.\n\nAll of this is likely to draw new scrutiny of the murky practice of MEV, and potentially lead to calls for reform among the Ethereum crowd. As for the Peraire-Bueno, the episode also showed that people with MIT degrees are also capable of old-fashioned stupidity. Not only did they get caught, but the DOJ also found evidence they conducted web searches about things like money laundering and how to get away with financial fraud. Don\u2019t Google your crimes, people! Finally, the brothers can at least take comfort that they are not the only MIT grads to be charged with crypto crimes\u2014the school is also the alma mater of a certain Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe government of El Salvador has mined 474 Bitcoins in the last three years via volcano-powered rigs, contributing to the country's overall holding of 5,575.

        "content": "Washington \u2014 A pair of brothers from New York and Boston were taken into federal custody Tuesday, accused by prosecutors of devising a novel criminal scheme to steal about $25 million in cryptocurrency from a commonly used blockchain, according to a newly unsealed indictment.\n\nAnton and James Peraire-Bueno were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Investigators accused them of spending months plotting their theft within the Ethereum blockchain, baiting their victims and establishing shell companies to hide their illicit profits.\n\nAccording to charging documents, the pair studied math and computer science \"at one of the most prestigious universities in the country,\" which prosecutors said afforded them a unique set of skills that allowed them to carry out the first-of-its-kind endeavor in a matter of seconds. James Peraire-Bueno is listed as a 2021 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the MIT Registrar's Office confirmed that Anton Peraire-Bueno earned a B.S. in computer science and engineering in February 2024, and James Peraire-Bueno earned a B.S. in mathematics, computer science and aerospace engineering in June 2019, as well as a M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics in June 2021.\n\nThe brothers allegedly started laying the groundwork in December 2022, engaging in what investigators called a \"baiting\" operation that targeted three specific victim traders on the digital Ethereum platform. They are specifically accused of exploiting the \"validators\" on the blockchain, vital components of the integrity and security of transactions.\n\n\"In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims' cryptocurrency,\" prosecutors alleged in court documents.\n\nInvestigators said the defendants' plot took months to plan but just 12 seconds to execute, allegedly raking in approximately $25 million from their unwitting victims.\n\nFrom April and June of last year, Peraire-Buenos are accused of laundering their money through shell companies. Prosecutors said the duo even rejected repeated requests from a victim, the victim's attorney and an Ethereum representative to return the cryptocurrency.\n\nThey were arrested on Tuesday and are expected to make their initial appearances in New York and Boston federal courts on Wednesday.\n\n\"As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, the Justice Department will continue to root out fraud, support victims, and restore confidence to these markets,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys for the brothers could not be immediately identified."

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > 2 arrested for $25 million exploit of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake validators\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEthereum\u2019s already wobbly foundation looks even shakier following the arrest of two brothers who exploited the network\u2019s vulnerabilities to steal $25 million from transaction validators.\n\nOn May 15, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the arrest of two brothers\u2014Anton and James Peraire-Bueno\u2014on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted on all counts, the brothers face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe MIT-educated pair are accused of netting around $25 million worth of tokens in a 12-second span\u2014the duration of a block validation \u2018slot\u2019 on Ethereum\u2014by manipulating vulnerabilities in the process by which Ethereum verifies transactions. Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the \u201cnovel\u201d scheme \u201ccalls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\u201d\n\nThe scheme involved Ethereum\u2019s so-called \u2018maximal extractable value\u2019 (MEV), the process by which Ethereum\u2019s transaction validators can preview and reorder pending transactions. MEV allows validators to personally profit from this advance knowledge by front-running significant or large transactions. European regulators recently flagged MEV for its potential for market abuse.\n\nThe DOJ says the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole funds that would otherwise have gone to a group of Ethereum validators using MEV-Boost. This open-source software outsources the creation of new Ethereum blocks to a network of \u2018searchers,\u2019 \u2018builders,\u2019 and \u2018relays.\u2019\n\nSearchers utilize automated bots to scan the Ethereum mempool for profitable arbitrage opportunities, then forward a bundle of preferred transactions to the builder. This bundle prioritizes the searcher\u2019s \u2018frontrun\u2019 transaction, aka buying a token on the expectation that the transactions that follow will boost the value of said token. The searcher also includes a \u2018sell\u2019 transaction further back in the bundle to cash out this expected spike in token value.\n\nBuilders sent these bundles to a relay, which initially submits only the blockheader to a validator. Only after the validator accepts the block for publishing to the chain does the validator see the complete ordered transaction list.\n\nTaking the bait\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the brothers began plotting their heist around December 2022, just months after Ethereum made its transition from a consensus mechanism based around proof-of-work (PoW) to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nThe brothers established 16 validators, then engaged in a series of \u2018bait transactions\u2019 to figure out what motivated MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The brothers thus identified three \u2018victim traders\u2019 that specialized in crypto arbitrage trades.\n\nThe brothers then initiated \u201cat least eight\u201d transactions (the \u2018Lure transactions\u2019) they knew would cause the victim traders\u2019 MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The bundles also included the victim traders\u2019 own \u2018buy\u2019 transactions in which they paid $25 million in stablecoins and other tokens to acquire \u201csubstantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies\u201d (aka shitcoins of little or no utility).\n\nThe victim traders also included their \u2018sell\u2019 transactions after the Lure transactions, but with coded conditions that the frontrun transactions couldn\u2019t be executed unless the Lure transactions \u201ctook place immediately after the frontrun trades\u201d and the sell transactions occurred immediately after the Lure transactions.\n\nBut the brothers had identified a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay code that prematurely exposed the full content of proposed blocks. This allowed the brothers to tamper with the victim traders\u2019 proposed blocks when one of the brothers\u2019 16 validators was selected to approve the next block.\n\nOnce the victim traders\u2019 $25 million buy transactions had gone through, the brothers \u201creplaced the Lure transactions with Tampered transactions. In the Tampered transactions, the defendants sold the same illiquid cryptocurrencies that the victim traders had recently purchased as a result of the Lure transactions and, for which the defendants already held as a result of information gathered through the bait transactions. In effect, the Tampered Transactions drained the particular liquidity pools of all the cryptocurrency that the Victim Traders had deposited based on their frontrun trades.\u201d\n\nThe net result was that the victim traders\u2019 sell orders couldn\u2019t go through, leaving them with worthless shitcoins while the brothers collected around $25 million in stablecoins and more liquid tokens. The brothers then published the re-ordered block to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe victim traders eventually caught on to what had occurred and reached out to the brothers, as did \u201ca representative from Ethereum.\u201d The brothers ignored these pleas and set about laundering their stolen loot through exchanges with minimal \u2018know your customer\u2019 controls as well as some decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nWhile the brothers may have graduated from MIT, they failed OpSec 101 by googling phrases such as \u2018money laundering\u2019 and \u2018does the United States extradite to [insert country here]\u2019 ahead of their heist.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the brothers\u2019 high-tech antics \u201cwere no match for DOJ prosecutors and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme.\u201d IRS Criminal Investigation unit special agent Thomas Fattorusso added that his office had \u201csimply followed the money\u201d using \u201ccutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d\n\nWhile the company behind MEV-Boost released an update to prevent future exploits of this kind, the reputational hit that Ethereum has taken since its shift to PoS shows no sign of ending. In fact, PoS is considered one of the primary reasons why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is (allegedly) preparing to designate ETH as an unregistered security.\n\nA significant chunk of ETH was already concentrated in relatively few hands, most of them belonging to Ethereum insiders who were the primary beneficiaries of 2014\u2019s controversial crowdsale. PoS was guaranteed to further concentrate control of the network, trigging more planks of the Howey test. Regulatory blowback was/is inevitable.\n\n\u2018Compromised and partially drained\u2019\n\nStill more \u2018crypto\u2019 bro-on-bro violence made the news this week courtesy of a hack of the BlockTower blockchain-focused institutional investment firm.\n\nOn May 14, Bloomberg reported that BlockTower\u2019s main hedge fund had been \u201ccompromised and partially drained by fraudsters,\u201d citing sources familiar with the situation who didn\u2019t want to be identified. The total amount of the stolen assets, as well as the nature of the hack went unspecified, but BlockTower has reportedly hired blockchain forensics experts to get to the bottom of this mess.\n\nAs a private company beholden only to its well-heeled investors, BlockTower has so far offered no official statement about the report. The company\u2019s main fund held around $1.7 billion worth of assets under management prior to the hack.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlockTower has suffered losses via exploits, having lost $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens after hackers targeted its wallet on the Dexibel decentralized exchange in 2023.\n\nBlockTower describes its Flagship fund\u2019s M.O. as \u201cfocused on liquid crypto assets via a multi-strategy approach analyzing both top-down market regimes and bottom-up asset selection (beta augmented with alpha), and incorporating market neutral strategies where appropriate to the opportunity set.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, BlockTower launched a dedicated venture capital fund that has taken stakes in numerous \u2018crypto\u2019 entities, including memecoin-factory Solana, struggling NFT-focused Dapper Labs, Sky Mavis (parent of the Axie Infinity game, which suffered a nine-figure hack of its Ronin Bridge network in 2022) and fraudulent \u2018algorithmic stablecoin\u2019 issuer Terraform Labs.\n\nHonestly, given that stellar track record, we\u2019re a little surprised there was anything left to steal.\n\nMake it stop\n\nBlockTower wasn\u2019t the end of this week\u2019s hackery. The Sonne Finance \u2018decentralized non-custodial lending protocol\u2019 was taken for $20 million worth of \u2018wrapped\u2019 ETH and USDC tokens. Sonne Finance said it\u2019s prepared to offer the hacker a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 that would allow him/her/they to keep 10% of their loot as payment for pointing out the gaping security flaws if they return the other 90%.\n\nBut the hacker has reportedly already swapped some of their ill-gotten gains for nearly 1,200 ETH and 183,000 DAI (an Ethereum-based stablecoin maintained by the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization). From there, the ETH will almost certainly tread the well-trodden path to Tornado Cash, the ETH-based coin mixer that helps obfuscate a digital asset\u2019s digital trail.\n\nWe say that with some confidence because on May 14, Reuters revealed a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee report that found Tornado Cash helped launder $147.5 million worth of ETH that was stolen from Justin Sun\u2019s HTX (formerly Huobi) exchange last year by North Korea\u2019s hackers.\n\nThat nine-figure sum was funneled through Tornado Cash in the month of March alone. A further $66.3 million worth of ETH that was stolen from the Sun-linked Poloniex exchange has been similarly washed. With apologies to ancient Rome, when it comes to stolen tokens, all roads lead to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe UN report, based on data provided by PeckShield and Elliptic analysts, also found that North Korea was the likely culprit behind 97 suspected attacks on \u2018crypto\u2019 firms that netted the Hermit Kingdom some $3.6 billion between 2017 and 2024. The same report indicates that North Korea may have been responsible for 11 \u2018crypto\u2019 heists so far this year that netted nearly $55 million.\n\nIronically, many of the victims of these heists were likely among the legions of \u2018crypto bros\u2019 loudly denouncing this week\u2019s sentencing of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in a Dutch prison for money laundering. Code is law, after all\u2026 that is, until it\u2019s your bits of code that have been stolen and laundered. Still, man up and take one for the team, right?\n\nOne imagines that, within crypto crook circles, it\u2019s hard to get angry when they get caught thieving from each other. After all, it\u2019s the dominant ethos of this game, in which the much-ballyhooed notion of \u2018building\u2019 doesn\u2019t so much take a backseat to \u2018grifting,\u2019 it gets relegated to a rickety trailer haphazardly hitched to the back of this out-of-control 18-wheeler.\n\nFor those of you who crave a more productive, utilitarian and (ta-da!) legally- and regulatory-compliant worldview, there\u2019s a little shindig going on in London next week that might be just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nWatch: Teranode & the Web3 world with edge-to-edge electronic value system"

        "content": "ARK 21Shares Amends Spot ETH ETF Filing: Cathie Wood On Ethereum ETF Approvals\n\nIn January, ARK Invest teamed up with 21Shares to offer a spot bitcoin ETF, which trades as ARKB. The ETF has been hugely successful, attracting several billion dollars in investment. However, the duo is not content with just a spot in a bitcoin ETF. They have also applied for a spot in ethereum ETF, which is currently under review by the SEC.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true .\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\nThough they did not make a formal comment, ARK and 21Shares updated their filing for the spot ethereum ETF application. The update removed a small clause related to staking. Originally, the firms were looking to stake ETH that was held by the firms, which would have been labeled as income from the fund. \"Sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Trust's assets through one or more trusted Staking Providers,\" the clause noted.\n\nHowever, the update excluded this clause. While they did keep all of the other clauses specific to ethereum, the change caused some to raise eyebrows. Eric Balchunas is an ETF analyst for Bloomberg and in a post on X, he said, \"While it may seem like this is them getting their docs in shape based on SEC comments (which would be good news) there hasn't been any comments. So it\u2019s prob either a Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection. Not sure (yet).\"\n\nAccording to Balchunas, the SEC did not prompt ARK and 21Shares to make the change. So, in his opinion, it is some sort of preemptive action to give their application a higher probability of acceptance.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nThe issue of staking has been seen by some as a hang-up for potential approval of spot ethereum ETFs. The novelty of the system could cause further delays in the already lengthy decision-making process by the SEC. So, by leaving it out of the application, ARK could improve its chances of approval. However, this does come at the cost of having a less attractive ETF, as the staking rewards would not be earned.\n\nThe SEC has already made delays to decisions on multiple applications. As it stands, the final date for a decision on the VanEck ETH ETF application is May 23, followed by ARK 21Shares' on May 24th.\n\n\"Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none,\" Balchunas said in a post on X.\n\nCathie Wood is the CEO of ARK Invest and is known to be extremely bullish on cryptocurrency. However, even she acknowledged that the crypto ETF market may not see much more growth. \"We'd be surprised to see anything but bitcoin and ether being approved by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission],\" she said in an interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for a spot ethereum ETF is getting weaker, and the SEC has not spoken often on the topic. While there is certainly a possibility that the ETFs could receive approval in late 2024 or 2025, it seems unlikely that they will occur anytime soon.\n\nRead Next:\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article ARK 21Shares Amends Spot ETH ETF Filing: Cathie Wood On Ethereum ETF Approvals originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024 2025 2026 - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "As the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has attracted the attention of investors and industry experts. With advancements in blockchain technology and the increasing popularity of decentralized applications (dApps), the future of Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a subject of widespread debate.\n\nIn 2021, the price of Ethereum hit an all-time high of $4,600, fuelled by the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Yet, what causes the price of Ethereum to continue to fluctuate wildly? Could Ethereum one day witness a value overflow of this cryptocurrency at a higher growth rate?\n\nIn this article, we bring you a detailed review regarding the factors that could influence the economic predictions of ETH in the coming years. We will also give you the anticipated costs in 2024, 2025, and 2026.\n\nEthereum Overview\n\nEthereum is an innovative cryptocurrency that takes the shape of a decentralized, open-source blockchain. It first emerged in 2015 and came alive via people looking for a network that encourages smart contracts and decentralized apps to be developed and used without manipulating, hacking, or being influenced by fraud.\n\nThis platform further aids creators in planning goods and performing contracts quickly without any negative consequences. Indeed, compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has a wider scope that includes cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. For this type of machines like those that are required to reach a new level of these apps, the \u2018Ethereum Virtual Machine\u2018 (EVM) lies in the epicenter of Ethereum.\n\nHistorical Price Analysis\n\nEver since 2015, prices of Ethereum have seen quite some lows and some highs at the same time; thus, it\u2019s been quite a volatile ride for the fintech asset. Ethereum prices had been determined and influenced by a lot of things such as the overall market sentiment, advances in technology and how well they were adopted within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA particular craze worth mentioning about 2017 was the ICO, and the buying using ETH alone brought about a surge in the demand for ETH. About $8 was its initial price at the beginning of 2017, and its price has reached an all-time high of over $1300 before 2018 ended. From there, a bear market showed continuous decline of ETH prices through months. ETH\u2019s price had leveled at around $130 at the end of the year.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic catalyzed the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and a lot of mainstream interest and recognition which it didn\u2019t have before. The rise of decentralized finance of the DEFI was primarily seen as very bullish for the evolution of the Ethereum Network, and subsequently, the price of ETH lifted from then. Each ETH was priced at $4600 at the end of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022.\n\nBy the end of 2022, Ethereum saw another dip which continued through all of 2023 with the fintech asset priced as low as 1100$. The market came back by the end of 2023 at a ranging price of around $4000. And in May 2024, the price of Ethereum is currently around $3080.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions for 2024, 2025, and 2026\n\nPrice Prediction 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum network grows and expands, the demand for its native cryptocurrency will also grow in 2024. More sharding and scaling solutions will strengthen the network\u2019s capacities and speed and draw more users into the system. Henceforth, the bull run is likely and the currency will hit the $3,500 \u2013 $4,000 mark, by mid-2024.\n\nBy the end of 2024, ETH\u2019s integration into traditional finance and major corporation adoption could cause the predictions to increase to $4,000 \u2013 $5,000 if foreign exchange and other layer-2 scaling solutions tonight volumes.\n\nPrice Prediction 2025\n\nBy 2025, the Ethereum ecosystem might further mature and absorb into various fields. By solving all the scaling issues (if there are any) and introducing new layer-2 solutions, it will become far more efficient and will attract even more users and developers. So, the price might rise in the years to come.\n\nSlowly, when more real-world uses are implemented, and Ethereum-based app usage increases, the use could potentially even make the demand rise up. Since it can be noted from many experts that big investors and traditional finance sectors have also increased their interest in Ethereum. It might also make a profit to much extent as it is considered that Ethereum will become a dominant blockchain platform.\n\nIf this continues, the price predicted might reach within the range of $6000-$7000 by the end of the year 2025. The cryptocurrency market is notorious and high volatility is one of the aspects preventing it since unexpected events happen in the market frequently, which might increase or decrease the prices. Any legislative shift can also increase or decrease the prices of any cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice Prediction 2026\n\nIn 2026, Ethereum may prove to be unbeatable and may have shown much progress. The powerful Ethereum ecosystem and scaling solutions may probably absorb almost all industries. By not having any stress to adapt and evolve as it is upgraded or updated regularly, it can potentially cause several organizations or even governments to adopt blockchain technology.\n\nThe price for Ethereum (according to experts\u2019 speculation) might reach a range of $8000-$10000 by the end of 2026 if significant developments occur.\n\nForecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024-2026\n\nYear Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024 $3,500 \u2013 $5,000 2025 $6,000 \u2013 $7,000 2026 $8,000 \u2013 $10,000 Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH)\n\nInvestment Strategies\n\nEthereum is no different than any other investments and it is important to do thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. Here are some effective tips for people looking to invest in Ethereum:\n\nTechnical Analysis: Some of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on. These pinpoint the price areas where one should sell and buy.\n\nSome of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on.

The upcoming years do have anticipated short-term volatility. However, the price growth potential it has is huge and is expected to grow significantly. Technological developments, scalability solutions, and increasing interest from institutions are driving such a surge. Investors are advised to do comprehensive research, frame proper strategies, and be cautious while playing around in the ever-volatile cryptocurrencies market.\n\nRead Also: Is Vanguard Charting a New Path with the Appointment of Outsider CEO Salim Ramji?"

        "content": "Two brothers alleged stole $25 million from the Ethereum blockchain after exploiting a flaw in a popular cryptocurrency software. Credit: GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT/AFP via Getty Images\n\nJust when you've thought you've seen everything when it comes to cryptocurrency theft, two brothers attending MIT have uncovered a brand new way to steal millions.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announcement on Wednesday, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno have both been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The brothers allegedly found a way to exploit the Ethereum blockchain and stole $25 million in cryptocurrency as a result.\n\n\u201cAs we allege, the defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. \"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe.\"\n\n\"Once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete,\" Williams continued. \"This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged.\"\n\nHow two MIT students exploited the Ethereum blockchain\n\nWhile one part of the brothers' scheme may have taken only 12 seconds, the DOJ indictment makes it clear that they meticulously planned and prepared for months in order to successfully exploit the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, transactions aren't verified in chronological order, but by \"maximum extractable value\" or MEV, essentially how much value can be earned by validators from the transaction. Validators verify transactions, and in turn, add new blocks to the blockchain.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Sign Me Up By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\n\nAccording to the DOJ, the two MIT students exploited a flaw in MEV-Boost, an open-source software used by 90 percent of Ethereum validators. Upon discovering the exploit, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno set up a series of validators using shell companies in order to conceal their identities. The DOJ alleges it took \"several months\" for the two to prepare for their scheme.\n\nThe Peraire-Bueno brothers set their plot in motion by creating \"bait transactions\" in order to trick \"victim traders\" into revealing their trading behaviors.\n\nIn April 2023, the two pulled off their $25 million crypto heist by \"luring\" in the victim traders' MEV bots with eight transactions containing \"illiquid cryptocurrency\" to frontrun and then transfer into stablecoins and other liquid cryptocurrencies. These bundled \"Lure Transactions\" from the brothers were timed to be verified by one of their own validators.\n\n\n\nFrom there, the brothers further exploited the system by forging signatures to deceive the blockchain relay into releasing the transaction information, which they then manipulated. As a result, Anton and James Peraire-Bueno walked away with $25 million and proceeded to take further steps to conceal their alleged crime.\n\n\u201cThese brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office in a statement. \u201cIn this case, IRS-CI New York\u2019s Cyber Unit simply followed the money.\"\n\nAccording to the DOJ, the two left a trail of incriminating evidence, including a document laying out the exploit in full detail, breaking their scheme into \"four stages:\" The Bait, Unblinding the Block, The Search, and The Propagation.\n\nIn addition, in the weeks and months following the exploit, the brothers search history unveiled queries for terms such as \"top crypto lawyers,\" \"wire fraud statute of limitations,\" \"money laundering,\" \"fraudulent Ethereum addresses database,\" and searches related to which countries the U.S. has extradition agreements with.\n\nThe two face up to twenty years in prison for each charge."

        "title": "Ethereum Scaling With L2s Has Damaged Its Tokenomics. Is It Possible to Fix It? - Unchained",
        "content": "While Ethereum layer 2s are at an all-time high in terms of active addresses and transactions, the mainnet may not be doing as well.\n\nEthereum, often celebrated for being \u201cultrasound money\u201d owing to its deflationary bent, has turned inflationary again over the past month, challenging the foundational principles that its community thought drove its value. A recent report from CryptoQuant has declared the ultrasound money narrative dead, sparking debates and concerns about the tokenomics of ETH.\n\nLearn more: What Is Tokenomics? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the balance between Ethereum\u2019s main chain and its Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s). While L2s have successfully improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability by handling transactions off the main chain, they have inadvertently reduced the demand for Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, on the main chain. This reduction in demand has led to lower transaction fees, measured in gwei, and subsequently, less burning of ETH. Currently, gwei sits at around 8, significantly lower than in previous times, indicating that at this level, ETH is far from being deflationary.\n\nRead more: Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020\n\nEthereum can shift from deflationary to inflationary due to changes in network activity and the balance of Ether burned versus issued. Under EIP-1559, when transaction volumes are low and the burned base fees are less than the Ether issued in block rewards, the total supply of Ether increases, making Ethereum inflationary. This dynamic demonstrates how Ethereum\u2019s supply is not fixed but responsive to network usage, potentially impacting its value and scarcity when shifts from a deflationary to an inflationary state occur.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum L2s are ripping, processing 10 times more transactions than the main chain, while reaching an all-time high in weekly active addresses.\n\nGiven these levels of gas fees, the question arises: how much activity needs to happen in the L2s for ETH to become deflationary again?\n\nRead more: Horizontal Scalability Is the Solution to L2 Fragmentation\n\nA Complex System\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs, a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, told Unchained that the deflationary mechanism of ETH is directly tied to its market cap and the balance between revenue and expenses. At low prices, the burning mechanism can exceed the issuance, making ETH deflationary. However, as the market cap grows and if revenues don\u2019t keep up proportionally, ETH can become inflationary.\n\nThis bidirectional influence means that the market cap not only affects the deflationary or inflationary nature of ETH, but also that this nature, in turn, affects the market cap through investor perceptions and behaviors.\n\nTo reverse this trend and restore the deflationary status of ETH, a significant increase in activity on L2s is required. This means that more transactions and fees need to be funneled back to the Ethereum main chain to increase the burning of ETH. However, according to Dietrichs, research has not been done to assess exactly how much activity it would take. Neither the Ethereum Foundation nor researcher Justin Drake responded to several emails requesting additional information on how much L2 activity is needed to keep ETH supply deflationary.\n\nIn addition, Dietrichs pointed out that for any given revenue and issuance level, with constant investor preferences, there is essentially one specific equilibrium market cap that the market would trend towards. Any change in these factors\u2014revenue, issuance, or investor preferences\u2014shifts this equilibrium market cap point. This dynamic feedback loop suggests that addressing the deflationary challenge is not just about tweaking a few parameters, but about understanding and influencing a complex system of interrelated factors.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, the question remains: Can the foundational promise of ultrasound money be restored, or will Ethereum have to adapt to a new economic reality?\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum has secured a breakthrough above $3,000, but the current state of things suggests that the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market might still face some troubles. The price has started an immediate reversal, and Ether could face additional selling pressure if it falls below $3,000 again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading around $3,005, with resistance levels at $3,200 and $3,400. If ETH can break through these levels, it could signal a stronger bullish trend than now. However, if Ethereum falls below $3,000, the support levels to watch are $2,900 and $2,800. A drop below these levels could indicate an aggravation of the bearish trend.\n\nRecent price action shows that Ethereum is struggling to maintain its upward momentum. The 50-day EMA around $3,067 and the 200-day EMA near $2,800 are critical levels to monitor. Breaking through the 50 EMA would be a positive sign, while falling below the 200 EMA could trigger more selling pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn-chain data provides additional insights. The number of active addresses on the Ethereum network has been fluctuating, indicating varying levels of user activity. Currently, the number of active addresses is around 450,000, down from recent highs. Transactions on the network have also shown some variability, with daily transactions hovering around one million.\n\nThe net ETH emission after EIP-1559 has been slightly negative, suggesting that more ETH is being burned than minted. For now, the situation has changed as activity on the L1 of Ethereum dropped substantially.\n\nEthereum's recent breakthrough above $3,000 is a promising development, but the asset is still facing some issues. Key levels to watch are $3,200 and $3,400 on the upside, and $2,900 and $2,800 on the downside."

        "title": "MIT students stole $25M in seconds by exploiting ETH blockchain bug, DOJ says - Ars Technica",
        "content": "Within approximately 12 seconds, two highly educated brothers allegedly stole $25 million by tampering with the ethereum blockchain in a never-before-seen cryptocurrency scheme, according to an indictment that the US Department of Justice unsealed Wednesday.\n\nIn a DOJ press release, US Attorney Damian Williams said the scheme was so sophisticated that it \"calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\"\n\n\"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of ethereum users across the globe,\" Williams said. \"And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete.\"\n\nAnton, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, were arrested Tuesday, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each brother faces \"a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count,\" the DOJ said.\n\nThe alleged scheme was launched in December 2022 by the brothers, who studied at MIT, after months of planning, the indictment said. The pair seemingly relied on their \"specialized skills\" and expertise in crypto trading to fraudulently gain access to \"pending private transactions\" on the blockchain, then \"used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims\u2019 cryptocurrency,\" the DOJ said.\n\nThe indictment goes into detail explaining that the scheme allegedly worked by exploiting the ethereum blockchain in the moments after a transaction was conducted but before the transaction was added to the blockchain.\n\nThese pending transactions, the DOJ explained, must be structured into a proposed block and then validated by a validator before it can be added to the blockchain, which acts as a decentralized ledger keeping track of crypto holdings. It appeared that the brothers tampered with this process by \"establishing a series of ethereum validators\" through shell companies and foreign exchanges that concealed their identities and masked their efforts to manipulate the blocks and seize ethereum.\n\nTo do this, they allegedly deployed \"bait transactions\" designed to catch the attention of specialized bots often used to help buyers and sellers find lucrative prospects in the ethereum network. When bots snatched up the bait, their validators seemingly exploited a vulnerability in the process commonly used to structure blocks to alter the transaction by reordering the block to their advantage before adding the block to the blockchain.\n\nWhen victims detected the theft, they tried to request the funds be returned, but the DOJ alleged that the brothers rejected those requests and hid the money instead.\n\nThe brothers' online search history showed that they studied up and \"took numerous steps to hide their ill-gotten gains,\" the DOJ alleged. These steps included \"setting up shell companies and using multiple private cryptocurrency addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges\" that specifically did not rely on detailed \"know your customer\" (KYC) procedures.\n\nThey also researched the \"very crimes charged in the indictment,\" the DOJ said. Among search terms found in the brothers' history during the planning phase of the alleged scheme were phrases like \"how to wash crypto\" and \"exchanges with no KYC.\" Later, seemingly attempting to prepare for any legal consequences from the scheme, the brothers allegedly searched for things like \"top crypto lawyers,\" and \"money laundering statute of limitations,\" and \"does the United States extradite to [foreign country].\"\n\nTo uncover the scheme, the special agent in charge, Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office, said that investigators \"simply followed the money.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the complexity of the case, we continue to lead the effort in financial criminal investigations with cutting-edge technology and good-ol'-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain,\u201d Fattorusso said.\n\nThe indictment comes the same month that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide whether to approve an ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to CNBC, the alleged fraud could fuel SEC skepticism as it reviews the ethereum ETF.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, a noted crypto skeptic, wants to ensure investors are protected before approving any potentially dangerous listings, CNBC noted."

Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation."

As the deadline draws near, several factors have come into play, casting uncertainty over the decision's outcome.\n\nAt the center of the SEC's deliberations is a crucial question: whether Ethereum should be classified as a security or a commodity. This determination could significantly impact the fate of the spot ETF applications filed by various firms, including VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity.\n\nIn a recent development, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson highlighted a concerning detail from a March filing by BlackRock regarding its spot Ether ETF application. The filing called for public feedback on whether the investment vehicle could be listed as a commodity, suggesting that the SEC might be exploring the possibility of labeling Ether (ETH) as a security.\n\n\"The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,\" Johnsson stated in an X post.\n\nMixed Expectations and Market Reactions\n\nBloomberg's senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, has expressed skepticism regarding the likelihood of approval, reflecting the general sentiment that the regulator might maintain a cautious stance toward cryptocurrency-related products."

In his last post on X, Marks pointed out several bullish indicators that signal Ethereum might be about to experience a huge price jump.\n\nBased on Marks\u2019 analysis, the current price structure of ETH is like a bull flag, a technical pattern that usually indicates a further upward trend. He stressed that the higher formation of the ETH\u2019s price action indicated the continued buying interest and strength of the buyers. This pattern is reinforced by a hidden bullish divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) where lower lows in the RSI are opposed to the higher lows in the price action.\n\nMarks stressed that this diversion is a major signal of the possible upward trend. Lower lows in RSI and higher lows in price action make a hidden bullish divergence which reveals the underlying strength in ETH\u2019s current trend.\n\nEthereum Eyes $4,811: Major Breakout Ahead?\n\nThe analyst also mentioned that a greater price breakout was on the way. He estimated an upside potential of over 63%, which could take ETH to a price of $4,811. This projection is drawn from the technical analysis and the past performance of similar patterns.\n\nSource: Chart by Javon Marks\n\nA successful bull flag breakout could be the cause of Ethereum reaching its new all-time highs, thus, affecting the whole altcoin market significantly. He thinks that if this happens, it would not only be a turning point for Ethereum but also a driving force for the advancement of other altcoins that usually follow the movements of Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and traders are watching the price action of Ethereum closely, hoping to get a signal of the bull flag breakout. If Marks\u2019 estimations are right, the crypto market could have a major rise, and Ethereum would be the one to lead the way. The possibility of new all-time highs is a great chance for those, who are in a good position in the market, to make a profit.\n\nJavon Marks\u2019 latest analysis shows that Ethereum has a bright future, as the technical indicators are in accordance with the trend. The market is waiting for ETH\u2019s breakout, which could be the key to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s future.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, two brothers who operate Ethereum validators, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe charges related to a scheme that has been described as exploiting the \u2018very integrity of the Ethereum Blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million.\u2019\n\nThe brothers allegedly worked together on a complex exploit that allowed them to take advantage of traders searching for \u2018maximum extractable value\u2019 (MEV) on Ethereum.\n\nBy operating multiple Ethereum validators, the brothers were allegedly able to submit blocks that included exploited transactions.\n\nAllegedly, once the brothers were aware that their validators would soon have opportunities to submit blocks, they would create \u2018bait\u2019 transactions that seemed to have significant upside for the MEV traders and wait for those traders to attempt to \u2018sandwich\u2019 their trades.\n\nThese sandwich bots will often look for transactions with the potential for arbitrage and place transactions that buy shortly before and sell shortly after.\n\nWhen the traders were baited into submitting these \u2018bundles\u2019 of transactions, the brothers allegedly submitted a fake signature to MEV-Boost Relay, which at the time resulted in the relays prematurely releasing the whole proposed block.\n\nThey then allegedly took advantage of the fact that they were operating validators to disassemble the block and allow the traders to still front-run. However, instead of buying the asset the MEV trader believes they are interested in, they actually sold that asset at the higher price.\n\nA rogue validator on Flashbot seems to be exploiting MEV bots. Over 25m USD already stolen.\n\n\n\nThe validator takes a sandwich bundle from the MEV bot and replaces the victim transaction with it's own that exploits the MEV bot instead.\n\n\n\nHere's how it works \u2013 pic.twitter.com/il3o9r41J1 \u2014 Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) April 3, 2023\n\nRead more: How Flashbots is taking over Ethereum block proposals\n\nThis technique did potentially put their validators at risk of slashing, but the $25 million they were able to take outweighed the economic costs.\n\nThe indictment additionally details some of the steps the brothers allegedly took to plan for the exploit and to launder the funds once received. This allegedly included creating an \u2018exploit plan\u2019 that broke down the exploit into four steps:\n\nThe bait Unblinding the block The search The propagation\n\nAfter the exploit, the brothers turned to internet searches to manage the risk of their decisions, allegedly searching for:\n\n\u2018Top crypto lawyers\u2019\n\n\u2018How long is US statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Wire fraud statute/wire fraud statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Money laundering statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Computer fraud abuse act\u2019\n\n\u2018Does the United States extradite to\u2019\n\nIn order to help clean the funds they received from this exploit, the brothers allegedly transferred some to a \u2018second-layer exploit address,\u2019 which was subsequently frozen. Much of the remainder, totaling approximately $22 million, was converted to Dai, a stablecoin.\n\nAfter going through a lending protocol, this Dai was allegedly exchanged for Circle\u2019s stablecoin USDC. These funds were then allegedly transferred to an exchange account controlled by Pine Needle Inc., the company set up by the brothers, before being transferred again to a bank account associated with their business.\n\nThis indictment represents the first time that anybody has been indicted in the United States on fraud charges related to changing the expected ordering of transactions on Ethereum.\n\nGot a tip?

In April, van Eck told CNBC he expected his firm\u2019s ethereum filing to \u201cprobably be rejected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the legal process goes is the regulators will give you comments on your application, and that happened for weeks and weeks before the bitcoin ETFs \u2014 and right now, pins are dropping as far as ethereum is concerned,\u201d the VanEck CEO added.\n\nA March filing regarding BlackRock\u2019s petitioned spot ether ETF indicated the SEC may be considering labeling ethereum as a security, not a commodity. The filing delayed BlackRock\u2019s decision until June and asked for public comment on whether ETH is a security or a commodity.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale Investments has withdrawn its filing for an ethereum futures ETF. This comes while Grayscale awaits approval on its proposal to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust into a spot ether ETF.\n\nDespite the pessimism over the SEC\u2019s next moves, the price of ethereum is doing quite well. The cryptocurrency is currently hovering around the $3,000 range. This marks a stark gain in more than a year: Ethereum sat closer to $1,800 in May 2023.\n\nLooking ahead, the SEC\u2019s debate over whether ethereum is a commodity or a security could keep spot ethereum ETFs off the market for now. Ether\u2019s regulatory status will ultimately determine whether or not spot ether is here to stay.\n\n\ufeff\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "SEC approval of spot ethereum ETFs would benefit all investors - American Banker",
        "content": "The SEC, having already approved spot bitcoin ETFs, ought to follow through and grant the same approval to spot ethereum funds. Doing so would create a new surge of investment, with positive economic impacts, writes Rachel Lin, of SynFutures. Unshu - stock.adobe.com\n\nOpinions vary widely on the potential approval of spot ethereum exchange-traded funds, or ETFs , by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Despite mounting uncertainty about when or if the regulator will approve the new financial instrument, there is optimism ahead pertaining to the prospects of an ethereum ETF approval \u2014 akin to the fervor for the once long-awaited bitcoin ETF .\n\nThe BTC ETF proved pivotal in driving institutional interest in the digital asset class, particularly in regions like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, where investors sought new growth opportunities after missing out on the stock market surge. Its success was the impetus to drive investors that once shunned cryptocurrencies to finally make the leap in a more secure fashion.\n\nAs the second-largest digital asset, ethereum boasts a vast ecosystem that positions it as a front-runner in the digital economy. Regulatory clarity, coupled with institutional investment, is poised to propel ethereum to unprecedented heights. Beyond mere price action, the approval of ethereum ETFs holds symbolic importance, solidifying crypto's status as a legitimate asset class and reinforcing its role in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nThe trend toward regulatory clarity is unmistakable, evidenced by the SEC's acknowledgement of ethereum's non-security status in permitting futures trading. This sets a clear precedent for the approval of a spot ethereum ETF. To deviate from this path would not only highlight regulatory ambiguity but also undermine market confidence. Moreover, proactive regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions like Hong Kong, where plans for spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs have just been greenlit, highlights the growing global acceptance and recognition of the potential of ethereum-based financial instruments. These developments underscore the urgent need for the SEC to align its regulatory framework with evolving market dynamics and maintain competitiveness in the global landscape.\n\nUndoubtedly, market demand from institutional investors serves as a driving force behind the push for ethereum ETF approval. The lineup of heavyweight players eagerly awaiting the green light \u2014 BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco with Galaxy, Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares with Ark and Hashdex, and most recently Bitwise \u2014 underscores the potential for ethereum ETFs to unlock new avenues for investment and liquidity. This influx of institutional capital could not only boost ethereum's market profile but also catalyze the development of more sophisticated products and services within the ethereum ecosystem.\n\nCryptocurrency House votes to nullify crypto custody guidance; Biden vows veto The House advanced a resolution that would roll back a Securities and Exchange Commission resolution that banks argue cuts them out of the crypto custodying business, but President Biden said he would veto it if it passes the Senate. May 9\n\nMoreover, the fact that the global ETF assets under management, or AUM, have exceeded $11 trillion suggests that investors are increasingly turning to ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle. While ETFs represent 13% of equity assets in the United States, indicating a significant adoption rate, their penetration is comparatively lower in Europe (8.8%) and the Asia-Pacific region (4.6%). The lower penetration rates of ETFs in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region suggest potential opportunities for growth. As more ETF products become available tailored to regional preferences and regulatory requirements, we may see a further expansion of the ETF market globally.\n\nConsidering the lessons learnt from BTC ETFs and the increasing recognition of crypto as a viable alternative asset, especially in a cooling economy, ETFs offer a less burdensome and tax-efficient means of exposure to cryptocurrencies. They simplify the complexities associated with owning crypto outright and broaden accessibility from individual retirement accounts all the way to large institutional accounts.\n\nThe broader impact of ethereum ETF approval reverberates across both short and long-term horizons. In the short term, we can expect increased trading activity and price volatility for ethereum and altcoins in the days leading up to the SEC's decision. However, in the long run, institutional adoption facilitated by ethereum ETFs could spur ecosystem growth, paving the way for a more robust and diverse range of financial instruments. Moreover, approval would provide much-needed regulatory clarity, particularly for ethereum-based financial products, mitigating uncertainty and fostering a conducive environment for innovation.\n\nIn light of the regulatory precedent, global trends and market demand, it appears increasingly likely that the SEC will grant approval for ethereum ETFs, notwithstanding delays and regulatory hurdles. I confidently predict that this will propel prices of bitcoin and ethereum to new heights. These milestones will reflect the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies and herald a new era of mainstream adoption and acceptance.\n\n"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, were steady hours heading into another U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer prices report.\n\nThe new Consumer Price Index report will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST. For now, things seem pretty tame in crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin price sitting just above $62,000\u2014up 0.6% compared to the same time yesterday. And the Ethereum price, which had sunk to around $2,900, was down 0.2% since Tuesday morning, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEconomists have been forecasting that the market is in for another disappointingly high Consumer Price Index report today. The CPI is one of the key metrics that the Federal Reserve uses to determine whether it should lower the federal interest rate. But analysts have flagged that gas prices have been on the rise and prices have been inching upwards in the services sectors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's bad, but not necessarily terrible news, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory is still down,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s been a more gradual downward move relative to the expectations coming into 2024.\u201d\n\nWhen the BLS issued its March Consumer Price Index report last month, it showed that personal expenditures in the U.S. had grown by 3.7%. The news that the U.S. economy had been growing slower than expected caused BTC and ETH to dip.\n\nBitcoin started the month having sunk below $60,000, briefly touched $65,000, and triggered the liquidation of hundreds of millions worth of derivatives positions along the way. More recently, the mix of macroeconomic factors\u2014including the war in Israel's War on Gaza and slowed growth in major economies like the U.S.\u2014has sparked pessimism in crypto markets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there's a little good news: Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes said earlier this month that the bottom for BTC is already in.\n\n\"I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. But he noted that he wasn't planning to add more Bitcoin to his bags.\n\n\"The recent intense puke out provides an excellent opportunity to unstake my USDe and spend synthetic dollars on high beta shitcoins,\" Hayes said. \"I\u2019m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions.\""

        "content": "The Department of Justice on Wednesday announced the indictment of two brothers who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for allegedly stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency within roughly 12 seconds.\n\nThe DOJ said the brothers \u2014James Peraire-Bueno and Anton Peraire-Bueno \u2014 plotted the \"first-of-its-kind\" crypto fraud involving Ethereum blockchain over several months.\n\nTheir father is Jaime Peraire, the H.N. Slater Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and a former head of the university's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\n\"We are in shock, we don't even know what's going on,\" Jaime Peraire told CNBC when contacted at his home in Massachusetts, and asked about the arrest of James, 28, and 24-year-old Anton.\n\nPeraire declined to comment further.\n\nProsecutors said that Peraire-Bueno brothers allegedly identified a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain that allows outsourced bots to identify the most valuable pending crypto transactions before adding them to the blockchain, according to the indictment.\n\nThey then allegedly posed as the Ethereum validators that use those bots and redirected the pending transactions to steal the $25 million, the indictment said. Foreign law enforcers allegedly froze roughly $3 million of those funds, but the two men converted the unfrozen money to the DAI crypto token, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the DOJ said.\n\nThe Peraire-Buenos also allegedly set up shell companies and used multiple private cryptocurrency addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges to hide their scheme.\n\n\"The defendants' scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, whose office is prosecuting the two men.\n\n\"Once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete,\" Williams said. \"This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged.\"\n\nJames, who lives in New York City, and Anton, who lives in Boston, were arrested Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nThey appeared separately in federal court in New York and Boston on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJudges set their bonds at $250,000 apiece, and each will be required to obtain two co-signers for their release bonds by May 29, according to a spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. They are also barred from trading cryptocurrency, securities and commodities.\n\nIf convicted, the brothers face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each of the three counts.\n\nWilliams's office said the Peraire-Bueno brothers studied math and computer science \"at one of the most prestigious universities in the country,\" and said that their education would have helped them to acquire the ability to carry out the alleged fraud.\n\nJames Peraire-Bueno earned a Bachelor of Science in mathematics with computer science, and in aerospace engineering in June 2019 from MIT, and then in June 2021 earned a Master of Science in aeronautics and astronautics from the school, according to an MIT spokeswoman.\n\nDuring his undergraduate years, he was a member of MIT's sailing team.\n\nAnton Peraire-Bueno earned a Bachelor of Science in computer science and engineering from MIT in February. He was a member of the university's rowing team.\n\nAnton's LinkedIn page says he was a cryptocurrency researcher intern at a San Francisco-based Polychain Capital for several months in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Anton co-authored an academic paper about a machine learning model that could have \"a strong practical impact\" for organizations \"with large amounts of sensitive data,\" according to a synopsis of that paper.\n\nLawyers for Anton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court docket did not show that any attorneys had filed appearances on behalf of James.\n\nThe charges come ahead of a long-awaited ruling expected from the Securities and Exchange Commission later this month on whether to approve an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nThat ETF would allow investors access to the ether token without having to directly own the cryptocurrency.\n\nIssuers of Bitcoin ETFs have already been bearish on the chances that the SEC will approve an ether ETF.\n\nThe DOJ's announcement of the alleged fraud could increase skepticism as the SEC completes that review.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has expressed concern about lacking regulation in crypto markets that could make it a dangerous listing for investors.\n\n\"To me, the fundamental question is, how do we ensure that the American investor is protected? And right now, they're not getting the required or needed disclosures,\" Gensler said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier this month.\n\n\"And the intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market generally are conflicted and doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do,\" he said."

He claimed recently that ETH is on its way to reaching a higher timeframe support level. \u201cThe good times are there in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d he assumed.\n\nCryptoYoddha was even more bullish, envisioning a price explosion toward the $10,000 milestone by the end of the year.\n\nLast but not least, World of Charts argued that ETH has started breaking the \u201cfalling wedge consolidation\u201d on a 12-hour timeframe. \u201cTrend is already up and expecting continuation towards $4500 in coming weeks,\u201d the analyst forecasted.\n\nObserving Some Important Factors\n\nOne element signaling that ETH\u2019s value could be on the verge of a rally is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). It helps to identify if the asset is overvalued or undervalued. A high ratio suggests a market top, while a low one may indicate a good buying opportunity. The MVRV has been on a significant downfall since mid-March.\n\nAnother factor is ETH\u2019s exchange netflow, which has been predominantly negative in the past month (according to CryptoQuant\u2019s data). Shifting from centralized platforms towards self-custody methods is considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.\n\nLast but not least, ETH\u2019s price may head north in case of the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. However, such a green light may also lead to the same immediate \u201csell-the-news\u201d event witnessed after the BTC ETF approvals in January."

That was the giant wake-up call that this is now an institutional asset. We also had the halving that we\u2019ve now put in the rearview mirror. There was also a view that the Fed would bring rates down significantly this year and that view has changed. It\u2019s changed in the market; it\u2019s changed here in Galaxy and so I think we\u2019re at a consolidation phase in crypto.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and everything else, Solana, will consolidate. What does that mean? It means [Bitcoin trades] probably somewhere between $55,000 and $75,000 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events brings us higher\u2026\n\nI think that\u2019s probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either (a) the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or (b) we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity, one way or the other, to the crypto regulatory landscape.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $65,884 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on the brink of a substantial recovery, as indicated by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The analyst\u2019s recent tweet has sent ripples across the digital asset sphere, highlighting a crucial technical indicator that suggests ETH's potential for a notable price upswing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenowned for his keen observations within the crypto market, Martinez took to X to explain that the TD Sequential of ETH has revealed a buy signal on the daily chart. He noted that this crucial signal indicates the potential for the Ethereum price to experience a rebound spanning one to four candlesticks.\n\nThe TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Ethereum daily chart! It anticipates that $ETH could see a rebound of one to four candlesticks. pic.twitter.com/Vg7FTl9X2a \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2024\n\nThis observation comes at a pivotal moment for Ethereum, which has witnessed a tumultuous period characterized by fluctuating prices and market uncertainty. At the time of reporting, ETH\u2019s current price stands at $2,910, marking a marginal decline of 0.01% over the last 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, zooming out to a broader perspective reveals a more significant downtrend, with Ethereum plummeting by 10.80% over the past 30 days. This downward price trajectory of ETH has left investors and enthusiasts alike on edge, eagerly awaiting signs of a price reversal.\n\nHope for community\n\nMartinez's assertion provides a glimmer of hope for Ethereum proponents , suggesting that the cryptocurrency may be poised for a resurgence. The TD Sequential indicator, a technical analysis tool utilized to identify potential trend reversals, has historically proven to be a reliable metric within the crypto space.\n\nWith its recent alignment in favor of ETH, anticipation for a bullish reversal has intensified among traders and investors. Despite the recent bearish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, the prospect of a rebound underscores the resilience of the digital asset and its underlying blockchain network .\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's journey toward price recovery appears to be gaining traction, with signals of a potential rebound emanating from key technical indicators. As the crypto community braces for what lies ahead, the resilience and adaptability of Ethereum stand as testaments to its enduring relevance in the digital economy."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 12, Solana generated more Total Economic Value (TEV) than Ethereum in a single day. This marks the first time Solana has outpaced Ethereum in its history, but there is always a catch.\n\nBreaking down the data\n\nAccording to Blockworks Research, Solana generated $2,248,681 in TEV on May 12, surpassing Ethereum's $1,977,416. TEV combines transaction fees and miner/extractor value (MEV). TEV is often used to analyze the utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nFor the first time ever on May 12, Solana generated more Total Economic Value than Ethereum in a single day pic.twitter.com/nrCe7pMNjb \u2014 Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 14, 2024\n\nChris Burniske, the former Ark Invest analyst, commented on the whole thing, stating that we should keep an eye on L1s that are keeping up their annual expansion in the form of TEV. Higher TEV can indicate greater usage and demand, which can, in turn, provide more flexibility in the economic policies of the network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a problem\n\nHowever, the achievement has sparked some debate between Solana and Ethereum users. Critics argue that comparing Solana's TEV with Ethereum's without considering layer-2 (L2) solutions is misleading. L2 solutions are built on top of Ethereum to enhance scalability and reduce fees, effectively offloading some of the activity from the main Ethereum blockchain (L1), while remaining a crucial part of it. As one commentator pointed out, \"Since some ETH activity has moved to L2s, wouldn't we include that? Come on Chris, this is just disingenuous if you don\u2019t take L2s into account.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, comparing TEV across blockchains remains valuable. As Burniske explained, each L2 operates in its own blockspace environment, and TEV comparisons are typically made on an L1-to-L1 basis. However, some may disagree with such an approach and consider L2s an inseparable part of larger ecosystems like Ethereum, which has struggled due to high fees in the past. For now, Ethereum fees sometimes drop even below Tron's."

They cited that this was the first time that a fraud like this had ever been the subject of US criminal charges.\n\nStating that the Peraire-Bueno brothers executed their elaborate heist in April 2023, the federal officers say they stole $25 million from traders in just 12 seconds after fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions and then altering the movement of cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cAs we allege, the defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\u201d New York Post quoted US Attorney Damian Williams as saying.\n\nThe authorities have charged the Peraire-Bueno brothers with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe report also mentioned that Anton was arrested in Boston, while James was held in New York.\n\nThe Peraire-Bueno brothers attended MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they studied computer science and math. Prosecutors claim they used their skills and education to commit fraud.\n\nThe prosecutors claimed that both plotted for months to manipulate and tamper with the protocols used to validate transactions for inclusion on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn addition, the prosecutors said that the Peraire-Bueno brothers exploited a vulnerability in the code of software called MEV-boost, used by most Ethereum network 'validators'. These validators check whether new transactions are valid before they are added to the blockchain."

        "content": "Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts believes Bitcoin (BTC) and a certain breed of altcoins will be beneficiaries of artificial intelligence\u2019s (AI) rise to prominence.\n\nThe former Bloomberg analyst tells his 16,200 followers on the social media platform X that AI will need a money system, and that BTC may be the best available form.\n\nHowever, Coutts says that stablecoins and the native tokens of smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NEAR, are also well-suited.\n\n\u201cAI needs a money.\n\nBitcoin is the best form factor, but it won\u2019t be the only one. Stablecoins and native tokens for smart contract platforms will also see widespread use.\n\nSOL ETH NEAR.\u201d\n\nCoutts recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) technology could send the total market cap of the layer-1 crypto sector soaring from the current $1.9 trillion valuation to as high as $25 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe analyst shares an excerpt from his firm\u2019s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services.\n\nThe report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.\n\n\u201cBy incorporating an \u2018AI growth factor\u2019 starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes New Gas Model for Ethereum Transaction Call Data\n\nVitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has introduced a new Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP-7706) that focuses on a revised gas model for transaction call data. Currently, Ethereum-based transactions incur gas fees for transaction execution and storage. However, Buterin's proposal suggests the inclusion of a third type of gas fee exclusively for call data, which refers to the essential information transmitted to smart contracts during Ethereum transactions.\n\nThe intention behind this modification is to allocate a separate charge specifically for the data transferred in transactions, distinct from the costs associated with executing contract code or storing data. The new gas model would introduce a transaction type that offers max_basefee and priority_fee as a vector, providing values for execution gas, blob gas, and call data gas.\n\nPresently, the Ethereum network employs distinct mechanisms to adjust the base fee for transaction execution costs and data storage in blobs. Buterin recommends a unified approach for all three types of gas fees, suggesting that a common method should be adopted for their management.\n\nThe proposed change aims to address the issue of high transaction costs associated with data-heavy transactions that do not necessarily involve significant computational intensity. If accepted, the Ethereum network would independently set the costs for call data, separate from other expenses."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn a candid tweet Thursday, DeGods and y00ts NFT project founder Rohun Vora (aka Frank DeGods) took a critical look at his previous decisions, especially those made during tumultuous times for the well-known collections. His reflection sheds light on the pressures of community expectations and being a founder.\n\n\u201cI used to try to move mountains to appease the community in times of chaos,\" he began. \"Every single time it's backfired.\"\n\nThroughout the years as the leader of DeGods, he has made many decisions to try and please his holders and keep the buzz going. For example, the team went through many art changes, including a planned upgrade and self-proclaimed art \u201cdowngrade.\u201d On Thursday, the team said that it would make no further art changes to DeGods.\n\nBut the biggest and most controversial move was bridging DeGods NFTs from Solana to Ethereum last year, along with y00ts from Solana to Ethereum sidechain network Polygon\u2014though they then moved y00ts to the Ethereum mainnet and returned a $3 million grant from Polygon Labs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\ni used to try to move mountains to appease the community in times of chaos. every single time it's backfired. the truth is, on the internet you either stand by your conviction or you're a pussy. i've been a pussy in the past. like the bridge off SOL. everyone in the community\u2026 \u2014 Frank (33.3%) (@frankdegods) May 16, 2024\n\nMaking the decision to bridge the projects off of the Solana blockchain happened as the community was in a state of panic following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022, which preceded Solana\u2019s price collapsing to a low of about $8\u2014roughly 97% from its 2021 peak.\n\nFrank, feeling the pressure, made the call to move the projects to the Ethereum ecosystem, which houses the most valuable NFT projects. He framed the move at the time as one designed to elevate DeGods into the big leagues of NFT culture.\n\n\"Like the bridge off SOL,\u201d Frank wrote. \u201cEveryone in the community was panicking (myself included) during FTX. I tried to fix their anxiety. In reality, I was just being a pussy.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrank contrasted his past actions with his current mindset, emphasizing the importance of standing by your convictions.\n\n\"The truth is, on the internet you either stand by your convictions or you're a pussy,\" he tweeted. Frank stressed that succumbing to short-term pressures and seeking immediate approval often backfires. It\u2019s a lesson he learned by leading one of the most prominent NFT projects, and one that has faced considerable challenges\u2014many self-inflicted, as he admitted.\n\nFrank recently announced the launch of an optional bridge back to Solana for both DeGods and y00ts. This move allows the community to decide whether to stay on Ethereum or return to Solana, reflecting his desire to provide flexibility and choice. There are no strong-armed incentives this time around. It's just an option.\n\n\"I said I want to allow our community to come back home and I meant it. I still do,\u201d he wrote, though they launched the latest bridge with decidedly less fanfare than the original.\n\nDecrypt reached out to Frank for additional comment, but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nFrank\u2019s tweet offers a raw and honest look at the challenges of leading an NFT project amid the constant demands of holders, particularly amid a diminished market for such assets. The bridge back to Solana and increasing openness about the past appear to be moves to atone for lingering regrets, all while the projects attempt to move forward.\n\nyou can now bridge your DeGods & y00ts between solana & ethereum. pic.twitter.com/EXCIwcvbY5 \u2014 de (@delabsxyz) May 1, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLooking forward, Frank expressed his belief in building a robust and resilient community, rather than one that constantly seeks validation through reactive measures.\n\n\"I believe that antifragility is the answer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat's my conviction. Not just building the best community, but the strongest one.\"\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

ETH is now testing the $2,925 support and might aim for a fresh increase.\n\nEthereum started a downside correction after the bears defended $3,040.\n\nThe price is trading below $2,960 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,965 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a fresh increase unless there is a close below the $2,925 support.\n\nEthereum Price Dips Again\n\nEthereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,950 and $2,960 levels, like Bitcoin. ETH even cleared the $3,000 level before the bears appeared near $3,040.\n\nA new weekly high was formed at $3,039 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $3,000 level. Ether dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading below $2,960 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are active near the $2,925 support and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,860 swing low to the $3,039 high.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $2,960 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,965 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $3,000 level. An upside break above the $3,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance sits at $3,050, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,150 level. If there is a clear move above the $3,150 level, the price might rise and test the $3,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,350 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,965 resistance and the trend line, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,925 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $2,900 zone. A clear move below the $2,900 support might push the price toward $2,850. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,740 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,925\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $2,965"

        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) buyers held the price floor at the $2.9k support level, as selling pressure continued to persist. Over the past month, ETH has traded between a broad price range with $3.2k serving as the range high and $2.9k serving as the range low.\n\nWith ETH trading just above the $2.9k support level, it has presented buyers with an opportunity to leverage the price zone for a possible reversal.\n\nPrice Range Offers Long Opportunity\n\nETH\u2019s latest price rejection came at the range high of $3.2k on May 6. This brought another wave of selling pressure that saw the altcoin retest the range low of $2.9k. However, it also presented an opportunity for buyers to rally.\n\nETH/USDT on TradingView (4H Timeframe)\n\nAnalyzing the previous price action in the trading range showed that ETH had successfully achieved bullish rebounds thrice from the support level. This makes it a solid price zone for buyers with the tendency for a repeat of the price movement.\n\nA look at the chart indicators indicated bullish movement. Capital inflows rose to +0.08 as indicated by the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF). Yet, the selling pressure kept the Relative Strength Index (RSI) under the neutral 50 mark. Bulls will need the RSI to flip bullish for a sustained upward rally.\n\nBuyers can consider entries at the current market price of $2.9k with a target zone of $3.1k to $3.2k. However, a bearish candle close below the $2.9k support level would invalidate the bullish thesis and interested buyers would have to consider the $2.7k support level for new entries.\n\nETH Long/Short Ratio | Coinglass\n\nTraders in the futures market leaned slightly bullish on the higher timeframes which could serve as encouragement for spot traders. However, the tight margins mean the trades could easily swing either way and open long positions should be managed properly to avoid getting caught out by sharp price drops.\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not constitute trading, investment, financial, or other types of advice.

        "content": "This week has been notably bullish for the cryptocurrency market as the Bitcoin price showed a notable rally from $60000 to $67000. Amid a sudden change in market dynamics the meme sector often shows a major move due to their inherent volatile nature and susceptible to speculating trading. The opportunity seekers can consider Ethereum based meme coins to buy such as Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Floki (FLOKI), and MOG Coin (MOG) projecting the potential of substantial growth.\n\nThe Meme coin frenzy is abuzz in the crypto space, with Solana-based and Ethereum-based meme coins leading the charge. Ethereum\u2019s popularity in the meme coin sector stems from several factors. It has a vast user base, ensuring extensive reach and adoption. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s integration with DeFi applications offers added utility to meme coins.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite Solana\u2019s growing presence, Ethereum\u2019s established network and extensive ecosystem continue to dominate the meme coin landscape, making it the go-to platform for these digital assets.\n\n1. Meme Coins To Buy \u2013 Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB) continues its impressive rise in decentralized finance, marked by a robust 12% value surge. Known as the second meme coin, SHIB has shown a 7% increase over the past week, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nCurrently priced at $0.00002447, SHIB is poised for further growth and maintains its upward momentum. It holds the 11th spot on CoinMarketCap, boasting a market cap of $14.42 billion.\n\nThis ascent is driven by several factors, including heightened trading activity, strategic token burns, and the rise of other meme coins like BONK, BOME, and WIF. Additionally, the rollout of Shibarium plays a significant role in SHIB\u2019s appeal.\n\nThese elements collectively make Shiba Inu an attractive prospect for potential investors aiming for substantial returns.\n\n2. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe (PEPE), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, is also gaining significant attention. With a current market cap of $4.04 billion, Pepe coin has secured the 24th position in market rankings. The Pepe price stands at $0.000009691, experiencing a remarkable 482% surge over the past year. This performance marks PEPE as the leading meme coin on CoinMarketCap.\n\nOver the past week, PEPE has seen a significant 20% rise, solidifying its status as a key player in the altcoin market. Its recent value surge following a bullish breakout positions PEPE as a prime option for investors looking to capitalize on the altcoin season in the 2024 bull run.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki (FLOKI), initially known as a meme coin, has now made significant strides in the Web3 space. Incorporating aspects of the Metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it has earned the nickname \u201cThe People\u2019s Crypto.\u201d Floki\u2019s blend of meme appeal and real-world utility sets it apart in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nAccessible on both the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, Floki is available as BEP-20 and ERC-20 tokens, respectively. FLOKI recently experienced a notable surge following the approval of a major token burn proposal by the FLOKI DAO.\n\nThis development, along with recent major listings and exchange integrations, has sparked optimism within the FLOKI community, suggesting a potential continued rise.\n\nCurrently, the Floki price is $0.0002007, showing an 11% decrease in the last 24 hours. Despite this, it saw a significant 15% increase over the past week. The crypto community is watching closely, anticipating further gains in the 2024 bull run.\n\n4. MOG Coin (MOG)\n\nMOG Coin (MOG) is also making waves in the cryptocurrency world with its unique meme-driven approach. MOG Coin price value now stands at $0.0\u202606229, marking a 0.10% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nSince the start of the year, MOG has skyrocketed by an impressive 3753%, positioning itself as a top affordable meme cryptocurrency for potentially massive gains in the 2024 bullish market.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum meme coins like Shiba Inu, Pepe, Floki, and MOG are poised for impressive returns in the 2024 bull run. With the market\u2019s upward trend, these coins present promising opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the growth of the crypto market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Declining on-chain volume in ETH indicates waning interest ahead of ETF verdict.\n\nA financial institution predicted a delay for Ethereum ETF, but not an outright rejection.\n\nSome major events are due to happen before the end of May. But if there is one that the crypto community places at the top, it is the U.S. SEC\u2019s decision on the numerous Ethereum [ETH] ETF applications.\n\nETF stands for Exchange Traded Funds. Unlike normal cryptocurrencies like ETH, an Ethereum ETF would only expose investors to the altcoin, not that they would own it directly.\n\nBut whether this would come to pass remains a big debate subject. For some, the SEC has no other option than to approve it, since it gave Bitcoin ETFs the green light.\n\nA stumbling block appears\n\nHowever, others believe that recent developments indicate that the regulator does not share that view. One notable figure that could hinder the Ethereum ETF approval is Gary Gensler.\n\nFor some time, Gensler who is the SEC chair, has publicly stated his dislike for the crypto ecosystem. Recently, the SEC served Well Notices to some firms, including Consensys.\n\nA Wells Notice is a formal notice from the SEC written to let a recipient know that the agency is planning to bring enforcement actions against them.\n\nConsensys is a blockchain software company developed to become an Ethereum knowledge center. Since the firm has links with Ethereum, it could be possible that the SEC says a big no to the applications.\n\nHowever, J.P. Morgan had a contradicting thought to this. While the firm said it does not expect an approval this month, it noted that it won\u2019t be an outright rejection. It explained that,\n\n\u201cMarkets do not expect an approval by this month as implied by the significant discount to NAV by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE.\u201d\n\nThe SEC faces a deadline between the 23rd and 24th of May to decide. However, it seemed that the broader market was skeptical of good news coming out of the development.\n\nInterest in ETH falls\n\nThis was evident in the series of outflows from Ethereum investment products which AMBCrypto reported. In terms of the volume, we also assessed the on-chain volume.\n\nAs of this writing, the volume was 11.17 billion. This was a significant decrease from the peak in March. Declining volume in ETH is a sign that market participants are losing interest in the altcoin.\n\nIf the SEC approves the Ethereum ETF, the price of ETH might also be affected. At press time, ETH\u2019s price was $2,910. A go-ahead could send the cryptocurrency as high as $3,500.\n\nBut if this is not the case, the potential decline to $2,700 might come to pass. However, eyes would be on two major applications, which are from VanEck and ARK.\n\nApplicants are closing the loopholes\n\nPreviously, ARK and 21 shares, who have a joint application, included staking in their Ethereum ETF filing. But in an amended submission on the 10th of May, they changed it.\n\nThe firms had hoped that staking would be included and added it as a feature in February. The rationale for the inclusion was that ETH could have served as part of the company\u2019s income.\n\nBut the fact that the SEC still has issues with labeling the cryptocurrency a security or not, left them with no option to be on the safe side. However, this does not imply that the Ethereum ETF would get a nod.\n\nIn the meantime, J.P. Morgan also commented on the possibility of a delay.\n\nAccording to the financial institution, a denial could cause a lawsuit, like the way Grayscale took the regulator to court before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nThis is because Grayscale had also applied to convert its Ethereum Trust to an ETF. The viewpoint read,\n\n\u201cThe template is likely to be similar to bitcoin: with futures-based Ethereum ETFs already approved, the SEC ( if it denies the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs) is likely to face a legal challenge and eventually lose\u201d\n\nDespite the anticipated verdict, the number of ETH holders has been increasing. According to Santiment, the total amount of participants holding ETH was over 12o million."

        "content": "SEC could reject spot ETH ETF application based on \u2018security\u2019 status.\n\nMixed feelings on possible SEC\u2019s rejection grounds as ETH price dropped.\n\nThe US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has been quiet on the status of Ethereum [ETH] and whether it will approve the spot ETH ETF filings.\n\nHowever, a recent development indicates that the agency could reject the ETF applications and raise ETH\u2019s security status issue.\n\nReacting to a recent SEC\u2019s notice on spot ETF filings, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart doubled his odds of the agency\u2019s rejection of the applications. Seyffart commented,\n\n\u201cLooks like odds just went up for SEC to deny Ethereum ETFs by claiming #Ethereum is a security. Not a guarantee that they will do this, but I think this almost guarantees that the SEC is at least considering it.\u201d\n\nMixed feelings about possible Ethereum ETF rejection\n\nThe overall market has been expecting a rejection of ETH ETF applications in May. The above development could shed some light on the possible grounds for the agency\u2019s move.\n\nHowever, Nate Geraci of ETF Store wasn\u2019t convinced the agency had a sound ground for rejecting the spot ETF applications.\n\nCiting the recent removal of staking features and existing ETH futures amongst others, Geraci wondered,\n\n\u201cIf SEC denies spot eth ETFs, what will rationale be\u2026Lack of correlation b/w spot & futures market? Then why approve eth futures ETFs. ETH = security? Then why approve eth futures ETFs. Staking? Issuers have (reluctantly) removed. I don\u2019t see path for legal disapproval here.\u201d\n\nLast week, ARK and 21 Shares removed staking features on their spot ETH ETF application. Some market watchers read the update as a possible approval by the SEC.\n\nThe sentiment was quickly reflected by the uptick in the chance of May ETH ETF approval on the prediction market, Polymarket.\n\nApproval chances jumped from 9% on the 10th of May (ARK\u2019s update) to 16% on the 13th of May.\n\nHowever, the revelation of SEC\u2019s possible ETF rejection and raising of ETH\u2019s \u2018security\u2019 status saw the approval chance drop to 13% on Polymarket at the time of writing.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s colleague, Eric Balchunas, also echoed his sentiment. Reacting to SEC\u2019s spot ETF notice, Balchunas said,\n\n\u201cTLDR: the SEC asked commenters re the Eth spot ETFs whether these filers have properly filed their ETF listing proposals as commodities. This shows the SEC is perhaps considering to ETH is a security in their denial. Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none.\u201d\n\nArk Invest and 21 Shares ETH ETF applications are due for the SEC\u2019s decision next week, the 24th of May. The decision on the Hashdex application will be on the 30th of May.\n\nHowever, pessimistic views on the SEC\u2019s spot ETF approval have dragged ETH\u2019s price down.\n\nThe king of altcoins has been in a price downtrend since mid-March \u2013 a bearish market structure that could push ETH to $2500 or lower."

After a sequence of lower highs, BTC could change the market structure if it manages a stable close above the $65,500 resistance level.\n\nThis is likely, provided BTC holders keep their profit appetite in check and buyer momentum increases. The higher lows on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show a growing bullish trend. Traders looking to enter long positions for BTC may consider waiting for a higher reading on the RSI.\n\nA stable close above $65,500 on the one-day time frame would encourage more buy orders, with the ensuing buying pressure sending Bitcoin price to $70,000. Beyond this level, BTC would have a chance at taking back the $73,777 peak. Notably, the DXY Compare indicator is also dropping, which has often displayed a countercurrent flow against BTC price.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders book profits for the Wednesday god candle, Bitcoin price could drop. A slip below $63,354 would spook panic sellers like it did on two recent occasions, May 9 and 13, where BTC was rejected from the aforementioned level.\n\nIn a dire case, Bitcoin price could descend below the ascending trendline and ultimately fall below the $60,630 support level. Below this level, BTC could roll over to $58,000, or worse, $56,552, levels last tested on May 1.\n\nAlso Read: Will GameStop stock resurgence have downstream effect on BTC and alts?\n\n$3,212 level is critical for Ethereum price\u2019s upside potential\n\nEthereum price is attempting to reclaim ground above the ascending trendline after a slip below on Tuesday.

For the 26% target objective to be realized, however, ETH must manage a candlestick close above $3,212.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased seller momentum could see Ethereum price drop. If the slump extends to close below $2,781, it would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nNotably, the RSI continues to chop sideways with equal lows as it remains subdued below the mean level of 50. This shows the bears still have the upper hand.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum faces key resistance in attempt at short-term bull run, Solana flips ETH Mainnet in terms of revenue\n\nXRP bulls sitting on their hands\n\nRipple price remains range-bound as XRP bulls continue to sit on their hands.

If the RSI records a higher high within the upper segment of the range, Ripple price could extend the climb.\n\nIn the meantime, Ripple price is likely to consolidate along the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $0.4952, with the horizontal chop likely to continue.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, enhanced profit-booking could see Ripple price wipe out the ground covered, slipping below $0.4952. In a dire case, XRP price could extend the fall to $0.4500, or worse, extend a leg down to $0.4188, levels last tested on April 13.\n\nAlso Read: XRP holds gains as attorneys debate relevance of discounts offered to Ripple\u2019s institutional clients"

        "title": "What is Mantle Network (MNT): exploring Ethereum's first modular Layer-2 solution - OKX",
        "content": "Mantle Network is a pioneering modular Layer-2 solution designed to help scale the Ethereum network efficiently, handling more transactions faster than before. The tool achieves this by bundling transactions together using Optimistic Rollup technology, reducing gas fees and speeding up transaction times.\n\nIt's understandable why the Mantle Network and its technology has gained plenty of interest, with scalability a hot topic among crypto commentators. By providing a fast and cost-effective solution, Mantle Network aims to make decentralized applications (DApps) more accessible and user-friendly for all on Ethereum.\n\nCould it be a catalyst that unlocks more of Ethereum\u2019s potential? Read on as we explore Mantle Network and its functionality, the advantages it brings to the space, the role of the project's MNT token, and more.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMantle Network's unique modular design improves performance and handles Ethereum's blockchain trilemma by separating execution, consensus, settlement, and storage.\n\nMantle Network uses Optimistic Rollup tech to speed up Ethereum transactions and reduce gas fees.\n\nInitially called BitDAO, Mantle is now backed by Bybit. This provides financial support and EVM compatibility for seamless Ethereum contract integration.\n\nMantle Network aims to lower fees and boost speeds to make DApps more user-friendly and accessible by increasing scalability.\n\nThe project's native token, MNT, plays an important part in the network's security and efficiency, and supports community governance.\n\nWhat is Mantle Network?\n\nMantle Network is an advanced Layer-2 solution for Ethereum. It uses Optimistic Rollup technology to increase transaction speeds and lower gas fees. Transactions are processed off-chain, but still settled on Ethereum to capitalize on the network's security.\n\nOriginally known as BitDAO, Mantle Network is backed by Bybit, a crypto exchange. This relationship not only provides the project with financial support but also helps attract a sizable user base, positioning Mantle Network as a strong contender in the Layer-2 ecosystem.\n\nMantle Network is built around a unique modular architecture. Unlike other blockchains, it separates execution, consensus, settlement, and storage into specialized modules. This modular design not only enhances scalability and performance but also maintains the network's compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine. As a result, existing Ethereum applications can migrate to Mantle Network with minimal modifications.\n\nMantle Network's Optimistic Rollup technology assumes transactions are valid and only checks for fraud if needed, improving efficiency. Meanwhile, the tool incorporates advanced data availability technologies like EigenLayer, which helps reduce the fragmentation of security on Ethereum and bolsters security for DApps using Ethereum-based modules. For Mantle Network users, this provides cheaper and more accessible data storage while inheriting Ethereum\u2019s security.\n\nMantel Network's integration of governance and utility drives the ecosystem's economic model, providing network security, functionality, and the maintenance of a decentralized and efficient blockchain environment. As a consequence, the technology's unique features and strong support make it a promising contributor to Ethereum's future scalability.\n\nHow Mantle Network works, and its advantages\n\nMantle Network comprises a variety of advanced tools and technologies that combine at Layer-2 to boost Ethereum's scalability. Read on to understand the network's architecture and the advantages it brings.\n\nValidator nodes and transaction compression\n\nValidator nodes are essential to Mantle Network's operation, and they bundle user transactions into compressed blocks. This compression reduces the size of the associated data, reducing gas fees and increasing transaction throughput.\n\nOptimistic Rollup technology\n\nOptimistic Rollups assume transactions are valid by default and only verify them if there's a challenge. This allows Mantle Network to handle a greater volume of transactions quickly and at a lower cost. When a batch of transactions is processed, it's posted to the Ethereum mainnet as \"calldata,\" a cheaper storage method that makes sure the data is accessible without overloading the Ethereum network.\n\nIf a user suspects a transaction is invalid, they can submit a fraud proof. The Ethereum mainnet then checks the transaction to make sure it's valid. If the transaction is fraudulent, the validator's bond is slashed, providing a strong incentive for honest behavior.\n\nEthereum compatibility and a modular architecture\n\nMantle Network supports Ethereum contracts and tools by allowing developers to quickly move their DApps to the network with minimal steps.\n\nMeanwhile, the network's modular architecture enhances its overall efficiency by separating the execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability functions into distinct layers. This modular approach improves performance and addresses scalability, security, and decentralization challenges \u2014 often called the blockchain trilemma.\n\nData availability and security\n\nMantle Network uses EigenLayer's EigenDA to ensure accessible and secure transaction data. This advanced technique offers high throughput while protecting data integrity.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of Mantle Network?\n\nWhile the functionality explored above brings a host of advantages to users of Mantle Network, there are some drawbacks to keep in mind.\n\nOptimistic Rollups can be complex\n\nOptimistic Rollups are complex. They assume transactions are valid, which can lead to delays if a transaction is challenged. This fraud-proofing process takes time, which can be a problem for applications that need immediate confirmation.\n\nCentralization risks exist\n\nOne concern is the risk of centralization, especially with the control of the sequencer in Optimistic Rollups. At first, the sequencer might be centralized, posing security and operational risks.\n\nAlthough Mantle Network plans to decentralize its sequencer to lower these risks, the transition process itself could still have weak points and cause a single point of failure.\n\nOver-dependence on Ethereum\n\nMantle Network relies on Ethereum for security, but this can be a double-edged sword. While it benefits from Ethereum's robust security, the network has also been affected by congestion and high gas prices on the mainnet. This can hurt Mantle Network's performance and cost-effectiveness during busy times on Ethereum.\n\nCompetition within the Layer-2 space\n\nAnother challenge for Mantle Network is the competition from other Layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. To stay competitive, Mantle Network must keep innovating and growing its ecosystem. That requires a lot of resources and a constant commitment to development to stay ahead.\n\nDevelopers face a learning Curve\n\nThere's a learning curve with Mantle Network's modular architecture. Although the modular design offers flexibility, it also adds complexity. Developers might need extra time and resources to understand the network's components, potentially slowing down development and deployment.\n\nWhat's the role of the MNT token in Mantle Network?\n\nMNT is the native token of Mantle Network. It's held in the Mantle Treasury and can therefore be considered \"not in circulation\", according to the project website. Meanwhile, the Mantle Governance process manages token distribution.\n\nMNT plays a variety of roles in the network.\n\nGovernance: MNT token holders can vote on important network decisions, such as upgrades, funding, and other key matters. Each token equals one vote, protecting a community-driven and decentralized Mantle Network.\n\nTransaction fees: Mantle Network uses the MNT token to pay transaction fees. It helps keep the network running and gives the token a purpose.\n\nStaking: You can stake MNT tokens to help secure the Mantle Network. This means locking up your tokens to support network functions like validating transactions.\n\nSupporting ecosystem growth: MNT tokens fund ecosystem growth initiatives, including supporting new projects, grants, and other development activities that expand the Mantle Network ecosystem.\n\nWhat's next for Mantle Network?\n\nIn 2024 and beyond, the Mantle Network is expected to grow and develop in several key areas.\n\nMost notably, Mantle Network's technology will reportedly be enhanced, with a particular focus on its modular architecture. The network's modular design simplifies the process of making upgrades and scalability improvements by separating functions like execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability into distinct layers. As a result, hard forks are no longer needed.\n\nDecentralization is also expected to be an important focus for the project going forward. Governance and decentralization are already a priority for Mantle Network. As the first DAO-based Layer-2 solution, the project emphasizes decentralized governance. Token holders decide on protocol upgrades and fund allocations, making sure any changes align with community needs. Mantle Network plans to decentralize its sequencer, making the network more resilient, secure, and less prone to censorship.\n\nEnhancements to staking on the network are another area of development, particularly with the Mantle Liquidity Staking Protocol (LSP). With LSP, users can stake ETH for yield-bearing mETH, making the network more useful and offering further incentives to the community.\n\nWhat's more, Mantle Network is expected to form new strategic partnerships aimed at enhancing interoperability and expanding the ecosystem. These collaborations should connect Mantle Network with DeFi protocols and Web3 applications, strengthening its market position.\n\nThe final word\n\nEthereum's scalability challenges are well documented, and Mantle Network is another Layer-2 solution that aims to ease this limitation for users and developers. The tool uses Optimistic Rollup technology to speed up transactions and reduce gas fees on Ethereum, but its influence goes further still.\n\nMantle Network's modular architecture provides compatibility with existing Ethereum applications, while its Optimistic Rollup technology assumes transactions are valid and only checks for fraud if needed, improving efficiency further.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to evolve while facing competition from established and emerging projects, solutions such as Mantle Network provide a compelling reason to use and build on Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum loses ultrasound money status.\n\nTotal supply has increased by over 100,000.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has transitioned from being labeled \u201cultrasound money\u201d due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which has altered its deflationary characteristics.\n\nThis upgrade reduced Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, leading to a slowdown in the rate at which Ether is removed from circulation.\n\nThe total supply of ETH has increased, and there has been a recent rise in the supply of ETH on exchanges. How does the supply on exchanges compare to the total supply?\n\nEthereum total supply and fees burnt display contrasting trends\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s supply metric on CryptoQuant reveals notable fluctuations in total supply dynamics over recent months.\n\nFrom November 2023 to early April 2024, there was a discernible decrease in ETH\u2019s total supply, dropping from over 120.2 million to approximately 120.06 million, marking a reduction of over 100,000 Ether.\n\nHowever, beginning from the 19th of April, Ethereum\u2019s total supply started to ascend, reaching around 120.1 million at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis recent increase in total supply is attributed to a decline in the fees burnt, which commenced following the Dencum upgrade.\n\nAn examination of the fees burnt metric illustrates a significant decrease, starting around March.\n\nDuring this period, fees burnt were approximately 6,000 Ether, contrasting sharply with the current value of around 890 ETH at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis significant reduction in fees burnt accounts for the observed uptick in Ethereum\u2019s total supply, indicating a shift in its deflationary dynamics.\n\nAlso, the decline in fees burn is due to the decline in fees on the network.\n\nEthereum sees a decline in overall fees\n\nThe recent Ethereum upgrade has led to a reduction in transaction fees, both on the main network and its Layer 2 solutions.\n\nData from Coin98 Analytics indicated that Ethereum transaction fees has reached a yearly low, averaging 0.00017E, which translates to approximately $0.5 per transaction.\n\nThis fees marks a significant decrease compared to levels observed around February.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the overall fees generated on the Ethereum network revealed a noticeable decline in recent times.\n\nAs of this writing, the total fees were around $3.6 million, contrasting sharply with the peak recorded in March, which stood at approximately $7.8 million.\n\nThis downward trend in fees commenced about a month ago.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges climbs\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum exchange supply indicates a notable upward trend, albeit with some interesting nuances.\n\nThe increase in exchange supply began before the total supply started to rise, with the growth, observed between March and press time, amounting to over 3 million Ether.\n\nAs of this writing, the total exchange supply was over 16.8 million.\n\nDespite this significant growth, the exchange supply remained relatively low compared to the total supply of Ethereum. This suggests that Ethereum is facing a manageable risk of oversupply.\n\nFurthermore, the proportionately low exchange supply indicates that the current price of Ethereum is not under immediate threat from inflationary pressures.\n\nETH continues to trend below $3,000\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum price trend on the daily timeframe is reflecting a challenging period. Following its drop below the $3,000 price level in the previous week, ETH has struggled to regain its footing.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $2,900, experiencing a decline of approximately 1.5%.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nBoth the Stochastic indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) were signaling a negative price trend. The RSI, in particular, indicated a bearish trend as it remained below the neutral line.\n\nHowever, the current position of these indicators suggested a potential price reversal in the near future, with ETH poised for a possible uptick."

        "content": "Thu 16 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe crypto markets experienced a bullish week, but Ethereum seems to be struggling to keep up with Bitcoin\u2019s rapid pace. While the total market capitalization increased by 5.5%, ETH failed to fully capitalize on this bullish momentum.\n\nCrypto: Ethereum Struggles to Keep Up with the Bullish Trend\n\nETH closed above $3,000 more than five days ago and has underperformed BTC by 22% since the beginning of 2024. This trend highlights the difficulty Ethereum is facing in maintaining its value against Bitcoin. Additionally, U.S. macroeconomic data seems to support the rally of some rare assets.\n\nAs a result, the markets reacted positively to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed a 3.4% year-on-year increase in April, in line with market expectations. Unfortunately, this indicator was not enough to boost Ethereum as it currently is with the queen of crypto.\n\nThe Growing Uncertainty Among Investors\n\nSome crypto analysts believe that the upcoming SEC decision on May 23, 2024, regarding VanEck\u2019s request for a spot Ethereum ETF, is a key reason for Ethereum\u2019s inability to break the $3,000 resistance level. The uncertainty surrounding this event is leading traders to delay their investment decisions until the outcome is more certain.\n\nHowever, despite long-term optimism regarding Ethereum\u2019s prospects, a rejection by the SEC could lead to a short-term market correction. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, has expressed doubts about the approval of an Ethereum ETF in 2024, given the regulator\u2019s cautious approach toward products that could be classified as securities, particularly those that include native staking services.\n\nIn conclusion, while the crypto markets have had a positive week, Ethereum still needs to prove its ability to keep up with the market leader, Bitcoin, in this bullish race.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "ETH was trading at a significant support level.\n\nKey technical indicators hint at the possibility of a continued decline in ETH\u2019s value.\n\nLeading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] is clinging to a crucial support level as its price trends within a descending channel.\n\nA descending channel is formed when an asset\u2019s price continues to make lower highs and lower lows, indicating a broader downward trend.\n\nReadings from ETH\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed the formation of this channel on 12 March. Since then, the coin\u2019s value has declined by 28%.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, the altcoin exchanged hands at $2915 as of this writing.\n\nA break below or a break above?\n\nIf ETH bulls fail to defend the coin\u2019s current support level of $2,850, its price might initiate a decline below the lower trendline of the descending channel.\n\nIf this happens, the altcoin will exchange hands at the $2600 level.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s assessments of some key technical indicators hinted at the possibility of a break below the current support level.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s key momentum indicators signaled that the coin\u2019s sell-offs outpaced its accumulation among market participants.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned below their respective neutral spots at press time. ETH\u2019s RSI was 39.52, while its MFI was 49.39.\n\nETH\u2019s Elder-Ray Index returned a negative value, confirming the current bearish trend. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nWhen it returns a negative value, it means that bear power is dominant in the market.\n\nLikewise, the dots that make up ETH\u2019s Parabolic SAR were spotted above its price at press time. These dots have been so positioned since the beginning of May.\n\nThe Parabolic SAR indicator is used to identify potential trend direction and reversals. When its dotted lines are placed above an asset\u2019s price, the market is said to be in a decline.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIt indicates that the asset\u2019s price has been falling and may continue.\n\nShould ETH bears force a break below the current support level, the coin\u2019s next price point might be $2780. However, if this projection is invalidated, the altcoin might rally above $3000."

        "content": "Among the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, BlockDAG emerges as a notable contender amidst the volatile Ethereum price predictions and Fantom's (FTM) declining market cap. Recently showcased at London\u2019s Piccadilly Circus, BlockDAG has captured the attention of major investors and is quickly becoming a digital asset to watch.\n\nFantom (FTM) Continues Growth Despite Market Fluctuations\n\nDespite some setbacks, Fantom has impressively doubled its market cap to $2.6 billion. Although there has been a dip in token revenue, the platform's growth in USD and total value locked (TVL) demonstrates a solid base for expansion. Enhanced by reduced staking requirements, Fantom is bolstering its network security and decentralization, making it a compelling alternative to Ethereum due to its focus on scalability and low transaction fees.\n\nEthereum Faces Price Resistance\n\nAs a foundational platform for smart contracts, Ethereum is currently grappling with price resistance around the $3,000 threshold. A successful break above this level could signal an upward trend, however, projections currently indicate potential drops to $2,880 or even lower. This volatility poses risks for short-term investors but could represent an opportunity for those looking at the longer-term potential. Despite these challenges, Ethereum continues to be a central hub for developers and a key player in the decentralized applications landscape.\n\nBlockDAG: Innovating and Captivating the Crypto World\n\nBlockDAG is quickly gaining traction in the crypto community with its distinctive approach to mining and engaging its community. Highlighted by its vibrant display in Piccadilly Circus and an event at the Las Vegas Sphere, BlockDAG is on the radar of many crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe upcoming launch of its X1 mobile mining app on June 1 is particularly exciting, promising to make mining accessible and efficient through a user-friendly platform. This app will enable smartphone users to mine BDAG coins without excessive battery or data use and will feature a leaderboard and referral system to foster a robust community ecosystem.\n\nBlockDAG: Poised to Be the Top Crypto Investment in 2024?\n\nWith the crypto landscape constantly evolving, new opportunities arise as established entities like Ethereum and Fantom navigate their own challenges. Amid this, BlockDAG stands out with its innovative solutions and community-focused initiatives.\n\nThe launch of the X1 app and its focus on making crypto mining accessible positions BlockDAG as an exciting new project that could lead the market. For investors searching for fresh and promising opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector, BlockDAG offers an appealing option, especially with its ongoing presale capturing significant investor interest.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

        "content": "Legal issues just keep on mounting in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nTwo brothers have been charged with wire fraud and money laundering related to $25 million in Ethereum that they stole in just 12 seconds, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, both in their 20s, face more than 20 years in prison if found guilty.\n\n\u201cThe Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,\u201d Lisa Monaco, the U.S. deputy attorney general, said.\n\nThe Department of Justice noted that this is the first such crypto heist it has seen. The Peraire-Bueno brothers studied mathematics and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the BBC wrote, and prosecutors say they used the skills they learned there to exploit Ethereum\u2019s system. They were apparently able to steal the millions of dollars in crypto by hacking into Ethereum traders\u2019 pending transactions and rerouting the money to themselves. When a representative for the blockchain got in touch with them, they refused to return the money and then tried to launder and hide it.\n\n\u201cThe defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\u201d Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Exploit,\u201d as investigators have called the scheme, took place back in April 2023. It\u2019s the first time this sort of fraud is resulting in criminal charges, the BBC noted. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the first time crypto has become caught up in high-level legal proceedings.\n\nMost notably in the States, the disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing $8 billion from his customers. Over in Turkey, Faruk Fatih \u00d6zer, who created the failed Thodex exchange, was given an 11,196-year jail term. And the Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges and said he would pay a $50 million fine.\n\nAll those cases involved men who held positions of power in the crypto world, making this week\u2019s case an outlier. The Peraire-Bueno brothers were able to infiltrate Ethereum from the outside and make a break for it with $25 million in their (digital) pockets. That money, though, will not have been theirs for very long."

        "content": "While enthusiasm wanes for spot Ethereum ETFs due to underwhelming performance, and Render demonstrates potential for recovery despite a recent price dip, BlockDAG has made significant strides with a major upgrade to its dashboard. This enhancement bolsters transparency and equips users with advanced tools for analytics, propelling BlockDAG to the forefront of the cryptocurrency scene with an impressive $26.9 million in presales.\n\nDeclining Enthusiasm for Spot Ethereum ETFs\n\nInterest in spot Ethereum ETFs has dwindled as Ethereum continues to underperform relative to its peers. The cautious approach by the SEC, especially under the leadership of Gary Gensler, has resulted in delayed approvals for Ethereum ETF applications, contrasting with the earlier approvals for Bitcoin ETFs. The withdrawal of Grayscale\u2019s ETH ETF application has further fueled skepticism, contributing to a pessimistic outlook for near-term approval. Ethereum's stagnant market activity has led to disinterest and uncertainty among investors, reflecting a broader sense of market apprehension.\n\nRender Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Market Fluctuations\n\nRender has recently seen a 4% decrease in its price but remains a subject of optimism as its trading volume has risen by 27%. Currently priced at $10.84, Render is expected to rebound from this minor slump, viewed by analysts as a normal market correction. Predictive technical indicators suggest a bullish trend, with Render potentially climbing to $12.21 and aiming to revisit its peak of $13.86.\n\nComprehensive Dashboard Upgrade and Mining Innovations by BlockDAG\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s latest dashboard upgrade introduces a new dimension of user engagement and transparency. The dashboard provides detailed transaction insights, enabling investors to effectively track their investment activities. Features like 'My Transactions' display detailed histories in various currencies such as BTC, ETH, and USDT. The 'Live Transactions' functionality offers real-time purchase visibility and categorizes investments based on the USD amount, enhancing the competitive aspect with a leaderboard that highlights the top 30 investors.\n\nAdditionally, BlockDAG continues to innovate in the mining sector with the launch of the X10 miner from its X series. This device boasts a 100 MH/s hash rate, capable of mining up to 200 BDAG daily, anticipated to deliver substantial returns at the official launch price. The X10 utilizes ASIC technology for high efficiency and low noise, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced miners.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s Position as a Market Leader in Cryptocurrency\n\nAs BlockDAG commences its twelfth batch with a compelling price of $0.0075 per coin, it has effectively raised $26.9 million by selling more than 9.1 billion coins. This achievement highlights BlockDAG as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. With uncertain futures for spot Ethereum ETFs and a recovering Render market, BlockDAG\u2019s innovative dashboard and mining solutions establish new standards in market transparency and user engagement. These strategic advancements position BlockDAG not only as a pioneer in technological innovation but also as a lucrative option for investors seeking substantial tools and potential high returns in the evolving crypto market.\n\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

        "content": "Mustafa has been writing about Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nStory Highlights Ethereum's price is rising due to positive market sentiment, lower transaction fees, and growing institutional interest.\n\nCoinbase adopting Ethereum and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF are seen as signs of confidence.\n\nEthereum's price could rise further if it breaks above $3,050 resistance, but it could also fall if it fails to do so.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, is currently on a remarkable upswing, catching the eye of investors worldwide. This surge is fueled by a mix of positive market sentiment, encouraging CPI Inflation data, and ongoing developments in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nAs of now, ETH is valued at $3,004.66, marking a significant 3.63% increase in the past day alone. This surge has propelled its market cap to an impressive $357 billion.\n\nKey Developments For Ethereum\n\nBehind Ethereum\u2019s surge are several key developments. Notably, Coinbase, a major fintech player, has chosen Ethereum as its go-to network for on-chain products and services. This move signals strong confidence in Ethereum\u2019s abilities and is likely to attract more users to Ethereum, boosting demand for Ether (ETH) tokens and driving prices higher.\n\nCoinbase, one of the most disruptive and influential fintech companies in the world, is using $ETH as their primary network for on-chain products and services.\n\n\n\nBlackRock, the largest asset manager globally, has an $ETH spot ETF pending approval and has recently issued a USD\u2026 \u2014 AdrianoFeria.eth \ud83e\udd87\ud83d\udd0a \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@AdrianoFeria) May 15, 2024\n\nMoreover, BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is on the verge of approving an Ethereum spot ETF. This move has sparked institutional interest, potentially leading to significant investment flows into Ethereum.\n\nLayer-2 Expansion\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2 networks are expanding rapidly, bringing down transaction costs and improving scalability. This makes Ethereum more attractive for various applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nETH Technicals Remain Strong\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Ethereum has shown resilience amidst market volatility. Recent bullish momentum pushed the price above key resistance levels at $2,950 and $3,000, reaching a new weekly high at $3,039.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum?\n\nLooking ahead, breaking above the $3,050 resistance could lead to further price gains, targeting levels around $3,220. On the flip side, failing to breach this barrier might trigger a downward correction, with support levels around $2,930 and $2,900.\n\nBullish or bearish on Ethereum?

        "title": "Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted several metrics that have turned bullish for Ethereum (ETH). The analyst noted that one of these metrics suggests an all-time high (ATH) for the second-largest crypto token.\n\nBullish Metrics For Ethereum\n\nMarks remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the bull flag-like price structure has formed on the Ethereum chart. He added that higher lows are forming in Ethereum\u2019s price action, which is also a bullish signal as it suggests a strong resistance to downward trends. Meanwhile, the analyst claims lower lows in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicate a hidden bullish divergence with Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nMarks then raised the possibility of Ethereum hitting a new ATH, stating that the \u201cbull flag breakout might lead into new all-time highs and be of major service in many Altcoin progressions.\u201d Before then, he claimed that Ethereum could soon experience a larger price breakout, making the crypto token experience a 63% upside to $4,811.\n\nCrypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe also recently suggested that Ethereum could make a major move soon enough and lead altcoins to make new highs. According to him, this will be triggered by the news surrounding the Ethereum ETF, as he expects that to be the \u201crotation for the Altcoins.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ethereum also risks experiencing a significant decline, considering reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject the Ethereum ETF applications. Crypto analyst James Van Straten stated that a rejection of the Spot ETF \u201csends the ETHBTC ratio lower 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.\u201d\n\nThis was one of the reasons why the analyst stated that \u201cEthereum looks like it\u2019s going to the grave.\u201d He also alluded to the fact that ETH has become inflationary with the Decun upgrade reducing transaction fees, which has ultimately reduced ETH\u2019s burn rate.\n\nThings Aren\u2019t Looking Good For ETH\n\nCrypto analyst Derek recently mentioned that \u201cEthereum dominance and recent performance are heading toward their worst ever.\u201d He noted that attention has turned to Bitcoin due to the reports about a potential rejection of the Ethereum ETF and securities status, which has put pressure on investment sentiment. According to him, this has caused the \u201cimbalance in dominance\u201d to reach its worst point.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThis Crypto Expert Called The Bitcoin Top in 2021, Now He\u2019s Calling The Bottom In 2024 4 months ago\n\nDerek further noted that Ethereum\u2019s unimpressive price action is affecting other altcoins, as their prices are \u201cdepressed.\u201d He also claimed that the prices of layer two coins \u201ccontinued to be under pressure.\u201d The analyst suggested that things could get worse, as the ETH/BTC chart shows a downward wedge pattern in progress. He claims that altcoins can only \u201cbreathe\u201d if Ethereum can escape this pattern quickly.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2906, down in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nFeatured image from Metaverse Post, chart from Tradingview.com"
