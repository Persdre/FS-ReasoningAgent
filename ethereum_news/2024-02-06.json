        "title": "SEC may be forced to declare Ethereum a security after controversial new launch - Fortune",
        "content": "Prometheum plans to announce on Wednesday the launch of custodial services for Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, whose $280 billion market cap is second only to Bitcoin\u2019s. The move may be part of a larger strategy by the crypto firm to get regulators to identify Ether as a security\u2014a position widely unpopular among industry peers.\n\nSo far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has avoided taking a position on Ethereum\u2019s legal status even while declaring more than a dozen other popular cryptocurrencies to be securities. The latest gambit by New York\u2013based Prometheum, which claims it has discovered a compliant path for crypto within existing laws, could force the agency\u2019s hand.\n\nLegal experts have told Fortune that Prometheum\u2019s plan to launch its custodial service may compel the SEC to resolve the long-running Ethereum question. If the agency does indeed proclaim Ether to be a security, Prometheum could be in a pole position when it launches its planned trading platform next quarter\u2014even as the rest of the industry insists crypto can\u2019t be viable without new laws.\n\nA controversial new player\n\nLongtime crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken offer trading platforms in the U.S., allowing users to buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. While many of the firms have been around for more than a decade, they still operate outside the regulatory framework of the existing financial system, which has led lawmakers to propose new rules for the industry.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has stepped up enforcement after the disastrous collapse of FTX, has said existing rules are sufficient and filed lawsuits against exchanges for failing to register with the agency. In response, companies like Coinbase have argued that the existing rules are outdated.\n\nWhile much of the U.S. crypto industry has sided with Coinbase, Prometheum has taken a different\u2014and contentious\u2014approach.\n\nFounded by two brothers, Aaron and Benjamin Kaplan, Prometheum received regulatory approval in 2021 to operate an alternative trading platform\u2014similar to a stock exchange\u2014where users can buy and sell different securities. The company went on to gain widespread attention in mid-2023 when it announced a first-of-its-kind approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u2014an industry oversight body that\u2019s independent of the SEC\u2014to operate as a special purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities. The SEC first created the designation in 2021, but no other firm has succeeded in obtaining a license, though others, including Robinhood, have tried.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claim to have found a compliant path for crypto trading immediately drew condemnation from legal figures in the crypto industry, who argued that even if the SEC and FINRA approved Prometheum\u2019s structure, it would not have any assets available for trading. That is because, skeptics argue, the SEC has jurisdiction over securities, while cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ether are more like oil or gold\u2014assets that don\u2019t fit the legal definition of a security and so can\u2019t be registered.\n\nThe Kaplan brothers, in contrast, agree with the SEC\u2019s assessment that most cryptocurrencies are securities. They argue that Prometheum will be able to list different crypto assets as securities under an exemption called Rule 144, which is used to trade restricted stocks, and that they can use blockchain data to determine whether the assets have been in circulation for more than a year\u2014a key factor for the exemption. As an alternative trading system (or ATS), Prometheum will not have to work directly with the issuers but instead can choose which assets to list.\n\nPrometheum\u2019s claims have not only riled the crypto industry but Republican lawmakers, who have argued that Gensler had propped up the little-known firm to further his own regulatory agenda. In a June appearance on CNBC, for instance, Gensler touted Prometheum\u2019s registration as a special purpose broker-dealer as an example of a compliant path for the industry. And last June, the company received a prized invitation to testify at a congressional hearing about crypto despite having virtually no presence in the industry.\n\nThe debate over Prometheum\u2019s proposal has until now been theoretical, but Wednesday\u2019s announcement of Ether custodial services, which are slated to launch by late March for institutional clients, means the company is on the cusp of becoming the first crypto exchange to compliantly offer assets like Ether for trading.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with the crypto industry,\u201d Benjamin Kaplan said in an interview with Fortune. \u201cOur goal is not to destroy, it\u2019s not to harm, it\u2019s not to undermine\u2014it\u2019s to help build.\u201d\n\n\u2018Move the ball forward\u2019\n\nIn the traditional world of stock markets, the various steps that make up a trade are divided among different firms. For instance, a retail trader visits a broker like Fidelity to buy a share of Apple stock, leading Fidelity to turn to a broker-dealer like Citadel Securities to fill the order. Next, a firm called the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, figures out who owes what in all the trades the broker has made that day\u2014a process known as clearing.\n\nAt this point, another DTCC subsidiary called the Depository Trust Company steps in to oversee the funds and securities moving from one party to another\u2014a process called settlement. Finally, an institution\u2014either the original broker or a firm like State Street or BNY Mellon\u2014serves as the custodian, meaning it holds the actual securities on behalf of the investors.\n\nOne of the reasons for separating these various functions is to prevent conflicts of interest. If Citadel, for example, was serving as both an exchange and a broker-dealer, it could digest customer trade information and front-run orders. Separating brokers into distinct entities also prevents markets from having a single point of failure, as happened with FTX.\n\nJames Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown focused on financial regulation, told Fortune that much of the separation is also historical\u2014a convention that the crypto industry is seeking to disrupt with the help of blockchain technology.\n\nFirms like Coinbase offer clearing, settling, custody, and trading services under one roof, an arrangement that provided partial fodder for the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against the exchange. The agency\u2019s primary complaint, though, was that Coinbase and others had not registered with the SEC to offer any of these services\u2014even as it sold what the agency deemed to be securities.\n\nPrometheum, meanwhile, believes it has found a way to sell crypto without triggering any of these objections from the SEC, in part by dividing itself into two entities.\n\nOne, the alternative trading system, is a member of FINRA and registered with the SEC, and will provide a front-end platform for investors to buy and sell crypto assets. The other entity, Prometheum Capital, is the company that received the special purpose broker-dealer license and a final go-ahead from FINRA in January to offer the clearing, settling, and custody services necessary to complete the trades.\n\nThe upshot is that, while firms like Coinbase have been battling with the SEC, Prometheum has been getting approvals from FINRA, which is nominally independent of the agency but also works closely with the SEC and is ultimately subject to its oversight. It is also notable that, while other firms have applied to receive the special purpose broker-dealer license\u2014the one created by the SEC in 2021 and issued by FINRA\u2014Prometheum is the only one to receive it.\n\nNow, Prometheum\u2019s custodial services for Ether announcement suggests the company is on track to offer the popular cryptocurrency for trading to institutional investors later this spring. More consequentially, by offering custodial services for Ether, Prometheum is claiming that Ether is a security\u2014a critical question that the SEC has yet to decide on\u2014and doing so as a FINRA- and SEC-regulated business.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to custody before you trade,\u201d Aaron Kaplan told Fortune. \u201cThis is hopefully going to move the ball forward.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a gamble\u2019\n\nFortune spoke with four lawyers and academics with expertise in digital asset regulation who agreed that Prometheum\u2019s custody launch could lead the SEC to finally rule on Ethereum\u2019s legal status, especially because Prometheum prominently displays its registered status with the two organizations on its website\u2014a decision that Boston University lecturer Mark Williams described as \u201cmarketing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d Williams told Fortune. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s part of their business strategy to force the hand of the SEC.\u201d\n\nWilliam Brannan, vice chair of the crypto practice at Lowenstein Sandler, said that Prometheum would be creating \u201cunnecessary controversy\u201d by announcing Ether as the first asset it would custody, given the SEC\u2019s reluctance to take a stance on it.\n\nEven though Prometheum\u2019s primary regulator is FINRA, which operates separately from the SEC, Brannan said FINRA likely would be working with the SEC on the question of Prometheum\u2019s launch of Ether custodial services, owing to the decision\u2019s magnitude.\n\n\u201cMy hunch would be that, particularly for these types of issues, FINRA is in very close contact and consultation with the SEC, and would likely be liaising with them and seeking to get some clarification on their position,\u201d Brannan told Fortune.\n\nAccording to a company spokesperson, since Prometheum received the special purpose broker-dealer license from FINRA, it doesn\u2019t require further approval to make assets available for custody, but it has informed FINRA of its plans to offer services for ETH.\n\nSpokespersons from FINRA and the SEC both declined to comment when reached by Fortune.\n\nIf the SEC took action to stop the offering, it would likely come after Prometheum launched its custodial services for Ether. Still, Ron Geffner, a partner at Sadis & Goldberg and a former SEC enforcement attorney, said that he does not expect the SEC to block Prometheum\u2019s approach given Gensler\u2019s stated desire to find a company that can operate under the SEC\u2019s preferred guardrails. \u201cThe SEC, given their position on crypto being a security, wants successful registrants in the marketplace that are complying with federal securities laws and supporting their position,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThe question remains whether Prometheum can draw investor interest\u2014and whether its approach will survive subsequent SEC administrations. The Kaplan brothers argue that creating a compliant approach will drive institutional participation in the crypto industry, although they haven\u2019t specified if the trading platform has potential clients lined up. Williams expressed skepticism that Prometheum would pull off its bold move. \u201cThey\u2019re not market-tested, so I would just have some caution in regard to their ability,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nBut even if Prometheum can\u2019t drum up demand, or running the operation proves too expensive, a successful launch could upend the industry\u2019s argument that crypto is incompatible with existing securities laws. And that clarity, Brannan said, wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain degree of value,\u201d he told Fortune, \u201cin just knowing exactly what the rules of the road are.\u201d"

        "content": "At that point, the company will either be proving the claims of its executives that crypto can be handled in the U.S. in a way that appeases the securities watchdog, or proving the naysayers who argue that it's impossible to meet the SEC's expectations. The stakes aren't just high for Prometheum and the rest of the industry, but also for the government agency that has claimed for years that there's a proper way for crypto firms to \"come in and register\" to do business in the U.S.; Prometheum came in and registered but what happens next is unclear. And while it tests these murky waters, it may also help establish whether the SEC intends to view ETH as a security."

        "content": "Today UBS announced the issuance of an investment-grade tokenized warrant in Hong Kong on the Ethereum public blockchain. It used the UBS Tokenize issuance solution. It was a call warrant on Xiaomi stock and was sold to OSL Digital Securities.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the UBS tokenized warrant reinforces the bank\u2019s position as the leading derivative products issuer in Hong Kong,\u201d said Winni Cheuk, Head of Sales, APAC Public Distribution, UBS Global Markets. \u201cCreated natively on a public blockchain in a permissioned environment, this innovative product enhances transparency, reduces transaction fees, streamlines settlement processes, and allows for more flexible trading hours.\u201d\n\nUBS has long been active in the institutional DLT space \u2013 it was cofounder of the institutional payment system Fnality. Recently it has been flexing its muscles in web3.\n\nUBS\u2019s expanding tokenization initiatives\n\nIn late 2022 UBS Wealth Management issued $50 million in digital debt securities to Asian high net worth individuals. That was followed last year by the Bank of China Investment (BOCI) issuing digital structured notes on Ethereum using the UBS Tokenize platform.\n\nAdditionally, UBS participated in multiple public blockchain trials as part of Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian. One involved a pilot for a tokenized money market fund issued on Ethereum. Another was for cross border repo \u2013 the sale and repurchase of a natively issued digital bond on a public blockchain. SBI and DBS partnered for the experiment, which spanned Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland.\n\nBeyond public blockchain trials, UBS is in production with intraday cross border repo. It was one of the first banks to adopt Broadridge\u2019s Distributed Ledger Repo (DLR), a permissioned blockchain infrastructure. A few months before the Project Guardian repo, UBS used DLR for a cross border intraday repo involving an Asian bank.\n\nIn related news, UBS is one of the five banks participating in Hong Kong\u2019s second government digital green bond issuance. Goldman Sachs\u2019 tokenization platform was used for the first bond, with HSBC\u2019s Orion for the second. Hence, UBS Tokenize could be used in a future issuance."

        "title": "What is Ethereum fragmentation? - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "Share this article\n\nEthereum\u2019s evolution is marked by the adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s), designed to alleviate the network\u2019s congestion and high transaction fees.\n\nL2s operate on top of Ethereum (Layer 1 or L1), processing transactions more efficiently before finalizing them on the main chain. However, this has led to a new challenge: each L2 functions in its isolated environment, creating silos that hinder interoperability\u2014a state we refer to as fragmentation.\n\nWhat is Universal Synchronous Composability (USC)?\n\nThe core issue with fragmentation is the loss of \u201cuniversal synchronous composability\u201d (USC), a feature allowing different applications to interact with each other seamlessly in real time. Imagine Ethereum as a bustling city where roads (L2s) connect buildings (applications).\n\nFragmentation is akin to having roads that don\u2019t interconnect, forcing you to take a long detour to move from one building to another.\n\nThe proposed solution, \u201cshared sequencing,\u201d is like establishing a city-wide transit system that links all roads, enabling direct travel routes between any two points without detours.\n\nTo further simplify, consider shared sequencing as the internet of Ethereum. Just as the internet allows different computers to communicate directly regardless of their physical location, shared sequencing enables different L2s to interact seamlessly. This system removes barriers, allowing for immediate transactions across the network, akin to sending an email from one side of the world to the other in seconds.\n\nTechnical Explanation of Shared Sequencing\n\nShared sequencing coordinates the order of transactions across all L2 solutions on Ethereum. It uses a centralized mechanism to sequence transactions identically across different L2s without requiring major infrastructure changes.\n\nShared sequencing leverages Ethereum\u2019s existing data availability capabilities. It proposes adding functionality for L2 solutions to sequence transactions in a unified manner. By sequencing transactions in the same order everywhere, shared sequencing enables instant interactions between L2s across Ethereum.\n\nPotential Use Cases for Shared Sequencing\n\nAdopting shared sequencing could revolutionize Ethereum. It would enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs by enabling seamless communication between L2 solutions. This would eliminate the need for complex bridging between L2s.\n\nShared sequencing could enable more robust decentralized applications (dApps) and services that integrate across L2s. This would improve user experience and accessibility. By restoring composability across L2 solutions, shared sequencing would strengthen Ethereum\u2019s network effects and dominance as a platform for blockchain applications.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Ethereum\u2019s Ecosystem\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s journey through fragmentation may resemble a challenging phase of growth, the horizon holds promise for a unified and efficient ecosystem. Shared sequencing represents a leap towards realizing this vision, offering a roadmap to re-establish Ethereum\u2019s composability and network effects.\n\nAs we look to the future, continued innovation and collaboration within the Ethereum community will be pivotal in overcoming current limitations and unlocking the platform\u2019s full potential. Through these efforts, Ethereum can evolve into a more interconnected and powerful platform, paving the way for the next generation of blockchain applications."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nPrometheum plans to offer custodial services for Ether, aiming to comply with existing laws and potentially influence regulators to classify Ether as a security. This contrasts with the SEC's current stance on Ethereum.\n\nPrometheum's strategy could lead to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refining its stance on Ethereum, potentially giving Prometheum a competitive advantage in the marketplace, as reported by Fortune.\n\nA different approach\n\nPrometheum, a new player in the crypto industry, has taken a unique approach to regulation by obtaining approval to operate an alternative trading platform and as a special-purpose broker-dealer for digital asset securities.\n\nThis approach marks a departure from the perspectives of major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken, which are advocating for amendments to the prevailing regulatory frameworks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrometheum's plan to offer Ether custody services may force the SEC to decide on Ethereum's legal status. While controversial, the move showcases regulatory compliance. Hence, Prometheum's success could redefine industry regulations, providing much-needed clarity.\n\nGensler's ambiguous stance\n\nThe stance of SEC Chair Gary Gensler on this matter has been somewhat enigmatic. In a recent interview, Gensler hinted that Ethereum (ETH) might fall under the category of a security, which marks a shift from his earlier tentative positions on the subject.\n\nGensler stressed that most cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, are often developed by entrepreneurs who employ various mechanisms to market their tokens and attract investment, with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.\n\nAccording to Gensler, this aligns with the characteristics of securities, thus placing them within the regulatory scope of the SEC. This perspective stands in contrast to the views of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)."

        "content": "EigenLayer is a new liquid restaking platform for Ethereum. The protocol allows users to stake the same amount of Ether (ETH) across multiple projects simultaneously to earn additional rewards. Proponents of the technology say that it will increase capital efficiency and spur innovation. Those against the technology believe that it could cause overleveraging and is susceptible to slashing.\n\nThough the new technology is causing a debate among ETH enthusiasts, it is impossible to deny the project\u2019s popularity. Initially, EigenLayer put a 200,000 ETH cap on each protocol so that it could test the concept without extreme amounts of volume. The limit was removed on Feb. 5. Within 24 hours, over 700,000 ETH, or over $1.6 billion was deposited into EigenLayer. According to data from DefiLlama, this brought EigenLayer's total volume locked (TVL) to nearly $4 billion, which is over 1% of all Ethereum in circulation. For comparison, EigenLayer had less than $300 million in TVL for most of December 2023.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWhile the limit on deposits has been temporarily removed, a new limit will be put in place on February 9th. While the exact limit is unknown, it will likely be close to the TVL on February 9th. However, the project has also stated that it hopes to eventually remove any deposit limits, though this will likely happen some time in the future, if it happens at all.\n\nOn February 5th, ETH appreciated more than 3.5%, causing its market cap to approach $300 billion. Despite the strong day, ETH was still down more than 1% over the previous 7 days.\n\nTo make the project even more enticing, EigenLayer has begun showing EigenLayer Points, which are a calculation consisting of the time spent restaking, volume restaked, etc. to formulate a numerical value. While there is no guarantee that this could lead to an airdrop, other staking platforms have used a similar system in the past to mete out tokens in the event of an airdrop. One example from recent memory was the Jito (JITO) airdrop on the Solana chain. This project also used a point system, which allowed users to be placed into tiers that gave different amounts of JITO on the day of the airdrop. Again, there is no guarantee that EigenLayer will use the points system for an airdrop, but it has been used in the past.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nEigenLayer and restaking is certainly an interesting system, especially considering the potential for spot Ethereum ETFs and Ethereum chain upgrades potentially coming soon. As the protocol continues to grow and we start to see its use cases, we will gain a better understanding of where liquid restaking could potentially play a role in the future of blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Ethereum Restaking App Approaches $4 Billion In Deposits: Biggest Airdrop In History Incoming? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Ethereum experiment ERC404 is an NFT-cryptocurrency hybrid \u2014 and it\u2019s already generated $87m in trades - DLNews",
        "content": "ERC404 is a novel token standard on Ethereum, combining the attributes of NFTs and fungible tokens.\n\nFor NFT traders, that means more liquidity and trading flexibility.\n\nTokens on Ethereum fall under two broad technical categories standards: non-fungible ERC721 and fungible ERC20.\n\nNFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are designed to be proof of ownership on the blockchain and each token of this type is unique. Fungible tokens, or simply known as cryptocurrencies, are not unique: one Shiba Inu token is the same as the other Shiba Inu token.\n\nBut a new experimental token standard, dubbed ERC404, seeks to make a hybrid of those two standards. Its implementation through an NFT collection of Replicants has piqued the interest of traders, resulting in about $87 million in total volume on decentralised exchanges and just under $1 million in total volume on NFT marketplaces in just the last week since its launch.\n\nUsers can sell their Replicant on popular NFT marketplaces like Blur and OpenSea or they can sell the fungible Replicant tokens on popular decentralised exchanges like Uniswap.\n\nThe price of one Replicant has risen from around 0.38 ETH on February 3 to over 4.26 ETH, giving the collection a fully diluted value of over $88 million putting them in the top 15 NFT collections.\n\nA new Ethereum token standard\n\nERC404 is an experimental token standard on Ethereum meaning it has yet to receive a full external audit.\n\nToken standards are simply a set of rules that smart contracts must abide by. The ERC20 token standard sets a series of rules that tokens must abide by, while the ERC721 token standard sets the rules for non-fungible tokens.\n\nBy combining these standards, each Replicant holds qualities of both a token and an NFT.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThis is different from fractionalised NFTs, which break a single NFT into tradable pieces, as this gives users the ability to sell shares in a single NFT, not an entire collection.\n\nERC404 greatly improves the liquidity \u2014 availability of funds \u2014 for NFTs, which are typically highly illiquid assets.\n\nUsers do not need to list their NFT and wait for someone to buy it \u2014 they can always sell the token on a decentralised exchange, like Uniswap, which has $19 million in liquidity for the PANDORA/WETH trading pool.\n\nThe new token standard has a few quirky consequences.\n\nIf the user then sells the fungible token, the NFT linked to it is destroyed. This dynamic where a new NFT is created upon purchasing one full token has caused the volume on decentralised exchanges to explode relative to the volume on NFT marketplaces, due to users trying to \u201cre-roll\u201d to try and get a red Replicant, the highest tier in rarity available. In NFT collections, rare traits command higher prices.\n\nThis frenzy has benefited liquidity providers on the token\u2019s Uniswap pool. The 1% fee on trades in this pool brought in just under $1 million in fees since February 3.\n\nBlur integrated the new standard into their marketplace within just two days. Others like BananaGun, a Telegram trading bot, announced ERC404 support today. Multiple other NFT projects have launched, or announced they will launch, also using this new experimental token standard.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

Are there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether\u2019s susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?\u201d the SEC queried in its request.\n\nThe regulator also asked for views on whether the proposed ETF would be susceptible to manipulation given the nature of the Ethereum market.\n\nOther questions covered topics like the liquidity and transparency of Ether markets, potential surveillance-sharing agreements with trading platforms like Coinbase, and the correlation between Ether spot and futures prices.\n\nInterested parties have until February 27, 2024, to submit comments on the proposed rule change. The SEC will then review the feedback as it decides whether to greenlight Galaxy and Invesco\u2019s Ethereum ETF."

The official launch of its custodial services is expected to come this quarter.\n\nETH will be custodied at a FINRA member firm and an SEC-registered broker-dealer. Prometheum also intends to broaden its custodial portfolio to include leading security tokens and utility-driven coins, with more details to be announced soon.\n\nAaron Kaplan, Co-CEO of Prometheum, emphasized the compliance and regulatory rigor behind this initiative.\n\n\u201cPrometheum Capital\u2019s custodial services, starting with ETH, are tailored to meet the stringent regulatory and compliance standards promulgated by the Federal Security Laws,\u201d Kaplan stated. \u201cOur unwavering commitment to compliance and investor safeguarding drives this milestone, signifying substantial progress towards establishing a new paradigm for blockchain-enabled market infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Prometheum plans to expand its offerings to include trading, clearing, and settlement services for retail and institutional clients within 2024, aiming to create a one-stop shop for all market participants.\n\nRegulatory crossroads\n\nPrometheum\u2019s new services spark speculation about Ethereum\u2019s classification as a security. Fortune suggests it could be a strategy to pressure regulators, as the SEC hasn\u2019t directly defined Ethereum\u2019s legal status, unlike other cryptocurrencies. By operating within existing laws, Prometheum\u2019s approach might compel the SEC to finally make a definitive ruling on Ethereum.\n\nThe launch of Prometheum\u2019s custodial service could force the SEC to finally address the long-standing ambiguity surrounding Ethereum\u2019s classification, Fortune cited legal experts."

        "content": "EigenLayer reopened deposits and saw its market size double to $4 billion in just two days.\n\nUsers are rushing to the protocol to position themselves for any whiff of a possible airdrop.\n\nThe restaking protocol is currently sitting on top of 1.5% of Ethereum\u2019s total available supply.\n\nEigenLayer is becoming a black hole for Ether liquidity.\n\nInvestors are rushing to deposit their staked Ether after the protocol reopened deposits this week.\n\nThe restaking protocol has rocketed to $4 billion in deposits, almost double the value of locked-in investments before its latest deposit resumption.\n\nEigenLayer has been periodically raising its deposit limit as part of its staggered launch, which began in June.\n\nThis week\u2019s growth now makes it the sixth-largest DeFi protocol by investor deposits and a mere $142 million from overtaking decentralised exchange giant Uniswap.\n\nEigenLayer deposits soar to $4 billion\n\nEigenLayer\u2019s $4 billion market size comes from the almost 1.8 million Ether amassed by the protocol thus far \u2014 about 1.5% of Ethereum\u2019s total circulating supply worth $284 billion.\n\nEigenLayer is the biggest player in the niche restaking market, which is attracting significant interest as DeFi\u2019s latest meta.\n\nInvestors are also pouring in on hopes of future rewards in the form of an airdrop.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEarly depositors to EigenLayer earn points for restaking on the protocol. Many expect these points will be converted to airdrop rewards if EigenLayer launches a native token.\n\nEigenLayer deposits come in natively-staked Ether and several forms of liquid-staked Ether. The former refers to Ether staked directly on the Ethereum network, while the latter applies to Ether previously locked in several liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Swell.\n\nRestaking is an extension of the popular liquid staking market which currently worth $35.3 billion, according to DefiLlama.\n\nLiquid staking emerged as a convenient alternative to staking Ether directly to the Ethereum network. Instead, after depositing your holdings with a liquid staking provider \u2013 like Lido or Rocket Pool \u2013 you get a token in exchange. This token acts like a receipt of your staking deposit and is pegged to the price of the original-blend Ethereum.\n\nImportantly, this staked version of Ether \u2013 also called an LST \u2013 can be reused in DeFi to continue earning yield or as collateral to mint stablecoins.\n\nRestaking adds another step to this process. LST holders can stake those deposit tokens in a protocol like EigenLayer and potentially rake in yet more yield.\n\nRestaked Ether provides pooled security that extends Ethereum\u2019s security architecture across more Ethereum apps and even other blockchains.\n\nLiquid staking wars heat up\n\nJostling for points and potential airdrops on EigenLayer has also triggered competition among the litany of liquid staking protocols on Ethereum.\n\nEigenLayer previously accepted liquid-staked Ether deposits from Lido, Rocket Pool, and Coinbase. But the protocol has expanded this deposit set to include nine others.\n\nMarket values of liquid staking protocols\n\nLido\u2019s staked Ether, represented by stETH, is the most popular LST deposit on EigenLayer at 579,062 stETH, worth $1.3 billion \u2014 almost a third of the pool \u2014 almost as much as the natively restaked ETH in the protocol.\n\nOthers like Swell\u2019s swETH and Stader Labs\u2019 ETHx hope to attract deposits using incentives such as boosted EigenLayer points. These two are the largest after Lido in terms of EigenLayer deposits, with $431 million and $206 million, respectively.\n\nA burgeoning related sector is called liquid restaking. Puffer Finance launched with much fanfare earlier this week, joining ether.fi, Kelp DAO, Renzo and Eigenpie. And that may all be just the beginning for a fast-growing sector in DeFi.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

        "content": "UBS has introduced Hong Kong\u2019s inaugural investment-grade tokenized warrant on the Ethereum public blockchain network. Leveraging the on-chain issuance product framework provided by UBS Tokenize, the bank\u2019s in-house tokenization service, this groundbreaking product is a call warrant featuring Xiaomi Corporation as the underlying stock. Notably, the tokenized warrant marks the first natively issued warrant on a public blockchain and was successfully sold to OSL Digital Securities Limited, a licensed virtual asset platform operator and wholly-owned subsidiary of OSL Group (formerly BC Technology Group).\n\nWinni Cheuk, Head of Sales, APAC Public Distribution at UBS Global Markets, highlighted the significance of the UBS tokenized warrant, reinforcing the bank\u2019s position as a leading issuer of derivative products in Hong Kong. This innovative product, created natively on a public blockchain in a permissioned environment, brings enhanced transparency, reduced transaction fees, streamlined settlement processes, and flexibility in trading hours.\n\nPatrick Pan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at OSL Group, expressed pride in collaborating with UBS, simulating the entire product life cycle of an equity-linked structured product token. From token minting through simulated secondary market transactions to token burning at maturity, the transaction represents a major milestone in Hong Kong\u2019s regulated virtual asset landscape.\n\nKey features and benefits of tokenized warrants include improved accessibility, leveraging blockchain technology for better access to digital structured products and extended trading hours. The utilization of smart contracts facilitates automation, streamlines trading and administrative processes, and lowers handling costs, contributing to increased efficiency compared to traditional channels. The transparency provided by blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and ownership records are securely stored on a decentralized ledger.\n\nThis tokenized warrant is part of UBS\u2019s ongoing effort to advance its tokenization services. Since 2015, UBS has been at the forefront of blockchain technology and digital assets, exploring various opportunities with a focus on developing institutional-grade infrastructure for tokenized assets. UBS Tokenize, an integral part of UBS\u2019s broader work in tokenization services and global distributed ledger technology, supports opportunities across origination, distribution, and custody, with an initial focus on tokenization of bonds, funds, and structured products. In 2022, the bank achieved another milestone by issuing the first-ever USD 50 million tokenized fixed-rate note, sold to Asia Pacific clients through the UBS Tokenize platform.\n\nImage by pat pat from Unsplash\n\nRead other stories: Bitfinex Securities Expands to El Salvador\n\nWhat investor protection measures are suggested when dealing with security tokens or other digital assets?"

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum network has recently observed a noteworthy supply drop, entering further into the deflation area. This week's data showcases a supply change with a decrease of 393.60 ETH, leading to a total supply of 120,179,017 ETH. This decline does not immediately impact the asset's price; however, a sustained deflationary trend could signal a positive development for Ethereum's market performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeflation in a cryptocurrency like Ethereum signifies that the number of coins being burned \u2014 taken out of circulation \u2014 is exceeding the number being created or issued. Such a supply contraction, especially when continuous, can be beneficial for an asset's valuation, as it may enhance scarcity and potential demand over time.\n\nETH/USD Chart by TradingView\n\nAnalyzing the current Ethereum chart, we observe that ETH has been maintaining a steady posture above the 100-day EMA (orange line), a significant indicator of long-term market sentiment. This positive position, juxtaposed with the recent supply deflation, provides a solid foundation for a potential growth scenario.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deflationary mechanism introduced by Ethereum's EIP-1559 is expected to play a vital role in the asset's price dynamics in the long-term future. As the network reduces its overall supply, each ETH token's relative value could increase if demand remains constant or grows. We might also consider this as a precursor to a new short-term era for Ethereum, where increased network activity causes severe deflation.\n\nThe recent outage of the Solana network adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. Historically, when alternative layer-1 networks face technical difficulties, Ethereum often benefits as the leading smart contract platform. The current downtime in the Solana ecosystem may redirect attention and activity back to Ethereum, potentially strengthening ETH's market position."

The area has 13 ETH-backed ETFs split across spot products and futures funds, amounting to $4.6 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nCanada is also a big market for ETH ETFs and commands a 16.6% market share of $949 million in AUM. ETFs have also become a gateway into crypto for many Canadian investors. Local regulators introduced stricter measures on crypto companies, leading to an exodus of exchanges like Binance and Bitstamp.\n\nGlobal ETH ETF AUM stood at $5.7 billion as of Feb. 2, spread over 27 ETFs featuring both spot and futures funds. European Ethereum ETFs have traded since 2017, when Grayscale launched its ETH trust (ETHE). However, Grayscale\u2019s fund was excluded from the study due to its close-ended structure.\n\nThe company was engaged with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over converting ETHE to a spot Ethereum ETF, but a decision was delayed till May, crypto.news reported.\n\nGlobal Ethereum ETFs markets | Source: CoinGecko\n\nYou might also like: Standard Chartered foresees Ethereum ETF approval by May 23\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S.\n\nFollowing approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the U.S., SEC chair Gary Gensler stressed that Ethereum-based products may not receive the same treatment.

A U.S. court found that the SEC\u2019s denial of spot crypto products while allowing futures-based ETFs was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.\n\nSEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also said Ethereum ETF approvals will not be the same as the Bitcoin counterpart, where a court ruling was required to cajole the securities watchdog into reassessing its decision.\n\nIn the interim, several spot ETH ETFs have been delayed until the second quarter of 2024, including bids from issuers like Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy."

Discover SCENE\n\nDymension\u2019s anticipated airdrop took place on Tuesday as the network\u2019s mainnet went live, serving up over $390 million worth of DYM tokens for early users and select communities as the token surged in value following the launch.\n\nDYM is currently up 58% on the day to a current price of $5.60, according to data from CoinGecko, with some $246 million worth of trading volume already on exchanges including Binance, ByBit, and KuCoin. The airdrop spans 700 million DYM tokens, representing 7% of the total supply.\n\nDymension is a network built to let developers deploy app chains that it calls RollApps, and it\u2019s a layer-1 blockchain built using Cosmos tech and the inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) to connect with various other chains. Builders can choose from various virtual machines and tokens on their RollApps.\n\nThe \u201cgenesis rolldrop,\u201d as Dymension called it, was available to more than a million unique wallets across various chains and communities, including users on the networks Solana, Celestia, and Ethereum scaling networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and the upcoming Blast.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCertain communities could also take part in the airdrop, including holders of the popular Pudgy Penguins NFT collection on Ethereum, as well as Mad Lads and Tensorians on Solana.\n\nWhile more than a million wallets could have claimed a share of the 700 million airdropped tokens, the claim already took place in January\u2014and only 528,523 wallets ultimately made a claim, which means that around half of eligible users left money (or DYM) on the table. Those tokens were ultimately redistributed to other users.\n\nDYM is currently the second-largest token airdrop of 2024 based on the total value of the dropped tokens. It follows decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator Jupiter on Solana, which airdropped 1 billion JUP last week\u2014which, at the current price, puts the total value of that drop at $527 million.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Morpho has overtaken Compound in total value borrowed on Ethereum.\n\nThe novel approach of matching borrowers and lenders peer-to-peer offers attractive rates for Morpho borrowers.\n\nMorpho has just surpassed incumbent lending protocol Compound on Ethereum in the total value of borrows. In terms of total value of crypto assets deposited, however, Morpho still has an uphill battle against Aave and Compound.\n\nMorpho crossed $903 million in total value borrowed on February 7, surpassing the $865 million in total value borrowed on Compound, according to data from DefiLlama.\n\nSince its inception, DeFi lending has been dominated by two protocols \u2014 Aave and Compound \u2014 which operate similarly to one another.\n\nUsers deposit funds into a lending market that other users can then borrow from, for a fee. Morpho operates similarly, but it also matches users peer-to-peer when possible, offering better rates for both borrowers and lenders.\n\nAlthough Morpho tops the total borrow value chart, the protocol sits at the sixth spot for the top lending protocols by total value of crypto assets deposited.\n\nTotal investor deposits in Morpho ($)\n\nAave currently has over $7 billion total crypto assets, and Compound has over $2.2 billion, while Morpho still only has $1.6 billion.\n\nWhat makes Morpho different\n\nGenerally with lending protocols, lenders will deposit their assets into a lending market from which users can borrow from.\n\nAlthough that method is popular, one disadvantage is that all that money deposited in a lending market sits idly, meaning a majority of the capital in these pools is not actively lent out, therefore, it is not generating yields.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nMorpho is built on top of Aave and Compound so it can take advantage of the same rates and assets within either protocol. But, it also tries to match users peer-to-peer to reduce the amount of idle capital and provide more attractive borrowing rates.\n\nWhen a peer-to-peer match cannot be made, it simply routes to the underlying lending markets; Aave or Compound.\n\nThis creates a scenario for Morpho users where at worst they will receive the same rates they would as using a conventional lending market, or at best, they receive the improved peer-to-peer rate.\n\nThe rates for DAI, a popular stablecoin, on Compound are 5.75% for lenders while borrowers pay 8.34%. On the other hand, the rate for borrowers and lenders when matched peer-to-peer on Morpho is 6.61% which is better for both parties.\n\nAlthough it may not seem like a big increase, for investors with a lot of money often called whales, these percentages can mean a lot. If a user opened a $10 million loan for stablecoin DAI and held it for a year, they would save over $173,000 by using Morpho.\n\nUsers are also rewarded with MORPHO tokens, but these tokens are strictly used for governance as they cannot be traded.\n\nThese tokens may hold financial value in the future, as the Morpho documentation states that token holders may vote to enable trading at any point.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

Some supporters now believe Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) could outpace top coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2024.\n\nThe project incorporates a stake-to-mine model for utility, adding value to its ecosystem.\n\nBTCMTX versus BTC and ETH\n\nSince Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered some of the safest (least volatile) cryptocurrencies, market participants often expect more sizable returns when buying other projects.\n\nNew coins typically have more upside potential because of their lower market caps.\n\nMeanwhile, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum are less volatile in each market cycle as liquidity grows from expanding market caps.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix will lists on various exchanges at a later stage; an opportunity some investors plan to exploit.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix\u2019s stake-to-mine model\n\nBitcoin Minetrix takes a novel approach to one of crypto\u2019s most pressing issues: Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe project has created a cloud mining solution on Ethereum for users to mine Bitcoin.\n\nYou might also like: Analyst says Ethereum can reach $10k in 2024, new altcoin likely to follow\n\nIt requires no specialist hardware or technical expertise. This addresses the problems of high-startup capital and skill requirements to begin Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix enables anyone to easily get started.\n\nTo get started, users stake BTCMTX, in exchange for Bitcoin mining credits. They can then burn these credits for cloud mining power, mining BTC.\n\nEarlier cloud mining solutions are regarded as shady due to a series of scams that have been carried out.\n\nThe Bitcoin Minetrix whitepaper highlights this issue, explaining that cloud mining protocols would lure investors with decent gains and then present \u201cunwarranted complexities\u201d once users deposit more cash.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin Minetrix believes in transparency and fairness, ensuring all transactions are recorded on-chain.\n\nFurthermore, no cash changes hands with Bitcoin Minetrix thanks to its stake-to-mine model.\n\nWill Bitcoin halving impact BTCMTX\n\nThe Bitcoin halving has correlated with the beginning of every crypto bull market.\n\nThe event, set for early April 2024, will halve miner rewards, creating a supply and demand discrepancy in the market.\n\nYou might also like: Next Bitcoin halving just 15k blocks away\n\nThis development might drive prices higher, possibly lifting altcoins like BTCMTX thanks in part to the project\u2019s correlation to Bitcoin.\n\nSince Bitcoin Minetrix users earn real BTC rewards, the value of Bitcoin Minetrix is tied to the Bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix tokenomics and presale\n\nBitcoin Minetrix tackles the mining problem but captures value using BTCMTX.\n\nSince BTCMTX is key to earning rewards and can be staked, it will relieve the token of selling pressure.\n\nAlso, staking rewards are primarily paid in mining credits, not BTCMTX. This differs from most other staking coins, which pay rewards in their native token, leading to sustained sell pressure.\n\n42.5% of Bitcoin Minetrix tokens are allocated to Bitcoin mining, 35% to marketing, 12.5% to staking, and 10% to the community.\n\nIn the current presale stage, BTCMTX is available for $0.0133."

        "content": "The Ethereum crypto has witnessed a notable rally, with its price soaring towards $2400, buoyed by the excitement surrounding the imminent deployment of the Dencun upgrade. Ethereum\u2019s core developers recently implemented the Dencun upgrade on the Holesky testnet, marking the final phase before its expected mainnet rollout in early to mid-March.\n\nThe integration of EIP-4844, a key feature of Dencun, is anticipated to revolutionize Ethereum\u2019s scalability and cost-effectiveness, particularly for Layer 2 rollup chains. Notably, the Ethereum price rally today also sparked curiosity, despite the SEC delaying the spot Ethereum ETF approval from Invesco and Galaxy Digital.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum Dencun Upgrade Live On Holesky Testnet\n\nDespite market consolidation, Ethereum has experienced a surge in price, fueled by optimism surrounding the upcoming Dencun upgrade. The successful implementation of Dencun on the Holesky testnet, as confirmed by Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh, signifies a crucial milestone before its anticipated mainnet deployment.\n\nThis upgrade, featuring EIP-4844, notably promises significant enhancements to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and transaction cost reduction, positioning the network for further growth and adoption in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade underscores Ethereum\u2019s dedication to ongoing advancement and innovation. With a focus on scalability through proto-danksharding, improved security measures, and enhanced network efficiency, Dencun is poised to strengthen Ethereum\u2019s standing as a premier blockchain platform substantially.\n\nEthereum Price To $3,500?\n\nIn a recent analysis, prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe highlighted the imminent uptrend for Ethereum (ETH), particularly as a focus on the Dencun upgrade. Van de Poppe predicts that the Ethereum price surge is imminent, with a target set at $3,500.\n\nExpressing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s potential, van de Poppe emphasized that the market is currently undervaluing the significance of ETH. He further disclosed his strong preference for the Ethereum ecosystem, foreseeing it as a major driving force in the months ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart stated that he continues to expect more delays in spot Ethereum ETF approval in the coming months. According to Seyffart, the focal point for Ethereum spot ETFs currently revolves around May 23rd, which marks the final deadline set by VanEck, another ETF issuer seeking approval from the SEC.\n\nAccording to a study by Coingecko, Europe leads the global Ethereum (ETH) ETF market, holding an 81.4% share. The region boasts 13 ETH-backed ETFs, covering both spot products and futures funds, with assets under management (AUM) totaling $4.6 billion.\n\nCanada also plays a significant role in the ETH ETF market, holding a 16.6% share with $949 million in AUM. ETFs have emerged as a popular entry point into the crypto space for many Canadian investors.\n\nAs of February 2nd, the total global AUM for ETH ETFs reached $5.7 billion, spread across 27 ETFs offering both spot and futures funds\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Ark Invest and 21Shares amended their joint application for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) in a Feb. 7 S-1 filing.\n\nAccording to one section, financial firms that are allowed to purchase and redeem ETF shares will only have access to cash creations and redemptions. They will not have access to in-kind creations and redemptions involving ETH.\n\nThe relevant section reads:\n\n\u201cAuthorized Participants will deliver only cash to create shares and will receive only cash when redeeming Shares. Further, Authorized Participants will not directly or indirectly purchase, hold, deliver, or receive ether as part of the creation or redemption process or otherwise direct the Trust or an Ether Counterparty [in that respect].\u201d\n\nCash creations and redemptions were key to recent approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and as such, the same should be expected for spot Ethereum ETFs. Though it is unclear why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ultimately insisted on cash-based methods, some reports suggest that it is difficult for participants to handle crypto under current U.S. regulations.\n\nUpdate also puts forward ETH staking\n\nThe latest filing also suggests that the ETF issuers intend to engage in Ethereum staking. The filing states that 21Shares US LLC, the sponsor, \u201cgenerally expects to stake ether tokens from the Trust\u2019s Cold Vault Balance.\u201d\n\nThe filing additionally notes that although staking may generate rewards, which are to be treated as income, staking also comes with a risk of loss.\n\nStaking is not guaranteed in the final proposal. Scott Johnsson, GP at Van Buren Capital, noted that this section is bracketed and uncertain. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that the SEC will ultimately not allow staking.\n\nAmendment may be good news for ETH ETFs\n\nArk and 21Shares\u2019 amendment is a relatively positive development for spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC recently extended deadlines for several other ETH ETFs, including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Invesco Galaxy. By contrast, today\u2019s amendment suggests some degree of progress.\n\nHowever, none of those developments change the fact that the SEC must decide on a spot Ethereum ETF by May 23. The agency must approve or reject VanEck\u2019s proposal on that date and will likely decide on other similar funds simultaneously.\n\nExpectations around the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF are mixed. One Polymarket prediction market reports 43% odds of a May approval. Seyffart believes there is a 60% chance of approval, while one JP Morgan member believes there is a 50% chance. Standard Chartered Bank expects an approval in May, while TD Cowen does not expect an approval in 2024.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the latest news has affected investor sentiment, Ethereum (ETH) has gained slightly more than the 24-hour market average. ETH is up 1.9%, the crypto market is up 1.5% and Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1.3%.\n\nEthereum Market Data At the time of press 8:45 pm UTC on Feb. 7, 2024, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 2.07% over the past 24 hours.

The agency then designated a longer period for approval on Dec. 13, 2023, extending the period during which it could approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings around approval or disapproval.\n\nThe agency\u2019s latest filing indicates that it has chosen the last option, thereby instituting proceedings for around approval or disapproval. The proceedings request that commenters address fraud prevention, market manipulation, and investor protections. These issues are at play for all other pending Ethereum ETF proposals and were also key to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThe SEC did not provide exact deadlines today. It said that comments should be submitted within 21 days of publication in the Federal Register, and that rebuttal comments should be submitted within 35 days of publication in the same.\n\nSEC expected to decide on ETH ETFs by May\n\nThe extension does not affect broader approval timelines for ETH ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart acknowledged the delay, writing:\n\n\u201c[The] SEC just delayed [Invesco and Galaxy\u2019s] Ethereum ETF. [This was] 100% expected and more delays will continue to happen in coming months. The only date that matters for spot Ethereum ETFs at this time is May 23rd.

        "content": "Bitcoin price continues its consolidation inside the $41-43,000 range for more than a week.\n\nEthereum price is likely to slide lower, allowing sidelined buyers an opportunity to accumulate ETH around $2,167.\n\nRipple price needs another sweep before it can kickstart an ascent to $0.532.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shows no directional bias whatsoever as it trades inside a tight range. Investors, however, are looking at Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and other altcoins for volatility.\n\nAlso read: Bitcoin price sustains uptrend as Chinese investors stampede out of local market in favor of US-focused ETFs\n\nBitcoin price squeezes\n\nBitcoin price action over the past week shows that volatility is nowhere to be found. As BTC trades inside a $41-43,000 range, investors are anticipating a move in either direction. Some forecast that a crash to $34,000 needs to occur before the pioneer crypto rallies higher. Others are playing a contrarian approach, expecting BTC to continue its uptrend as it breaches the tightening range.\n\nRegardless of what direction Bitcoin price goes after its breakout, this analysis will focus on a smaller time frame outlook. The key levels that investors need to be watching are\n\nMonday\u2019s high at $43,567 Monday\u2019s low at $42,229 and Previous Monday\u2019s low at $41,167.\n\nUsing a range-bound trading strategy, if price sweeps liquidity above/below one of these points it will suggest it is about to move back within the range toward the lower or upper bound, continuing an extension of the ranging market.\n\nFrom the looks of the ongoing consolidation, the chances of an upward move to the $43,567 level first appears high, which would then likely be followed by a sweep of $41,167.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin price sweeps the $41,167 support level first, it would allow investors to open a long position targeting $43,567.\n\nEthereum price wants to move higher\n\nEthereum price trades inside the $2,167 to $2,719 range and is targeting a retest of the resistance zone, extending from $2,400 to $2,600. But considering the Relative Strength Index\u2019s (RSI) position, a sweep of the $2,167 level first looks likely.\n\nA sweep followed by a quick recovery will be a key buy signal for sidelined buyers. This move is likely going to result in a retest of the range\u2019s midpoint at $2,443.\n\nIn some cases, Ethereum price might extend higher if the buying pressure ratchets up.\n\nAlso read: Over 50% of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens listed on DEXes show characteristics of pump and dump\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nRegardless, if Ethereum price breaches $2,167, it will invalidate the bullish thesis by producing a lower low. In such a case, ETH could revisit $2,000 and lower levels.\n\nRipple price at the end of its downtrend\n\nRipple price shows that it is approaching a potential bottom on the three-day chart. Investors should expect a potential sweep of the $0.468 support level before an uptrend kickstarts.\n\nIf this liquidity run is followed by a quick recovery off the aforementioned level, it will be a buy signal. In such a case, investors can expect XRP to eye a 13% rally to retest the weekly barrier at $0.532.\n\nAlso read: XRP price could deteriorate with Ripple\u2019s request for deadline extension in SEC lawsuit\n\nXRP/USDT 3-day chart\n\nWhile the outlook for Ripple price is logical, a break below and then flipping of the $0.468 support level from the Autumn 2023 lows, into a resistance level will invalidate the bullish thesis. In such a case, XRP could nosedive 19% and tag the next key support level at $0.379."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolana is showing signs of a potentially significant technical development on its trading chart against Ethereum. The asset is currently engaging in a critical battle at the 50-day EMA, a level that will determine the medium-term trend direction for the asset.\n\nAt this juncture, the 50 EMA is acting as a dynamic resistance level. Solana's attempts to break above this level have been met with resistance, but there is a persistent effort from the bulls to push through. Should Solana manage to decisively close above the 50 EMA, it would likely confirm an important new support level, which could bolster investor confidence and potentially lead to a new leg up in its price against ETH.\n\nHowever, despite the bullish attempts, the volume profile suggests that there is not substantial buying activity to give Solana the powerful push it needs to sustain above the 50 EMA. The volume, a crucial indicator of market enthusiasm, is somewhat lacking, indicating that the current push may not have the necessary momentum to create a reliable new support level.\n\nThe support level to watch, if Solana fails to break the 50 EMA, is positioned around the 100-day EMA. A retracement to this level could provide a bounce-back opportunity for the asset, but it would also reflect short-term bearish sentiment, indicating that the market is not ready for a breakout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP stays irrelevant\n\nUnpredictability is often the name of the cryptocurrency game. However, XRP has recently been tracing a path \"too predictable\" for a cryptocurrency. A few days ago, XRP appeared to be gathering momentum, but a swift correction quickly dispelled the budding optimism, bringing it down to lower support levels.\n\nThe focal point for traders now is the $0.47 support level. This key threshold is anticipated to be the springboard for a potential reversal. Yet, the timing of when XRP might reach and rebound from this level remains nebulous. The lack of volatility in XRP's price movements is serving to complicate predictions further.\n\nVolatility is a measure of trading opportunities, with larger price swings offering more potential for profit (and loss). The current state of flatlined price action limits these opportunities, potentially driving traders to look for more dynamic assets to trade.\n\nThe resistance levels to watch are at $0.5714 and $0.5633 which, if broken, could suggest the beginnings of a reversal pattern. However, without significant buying activity, these levels may continue to cap any upward movements.\n\nEthereum's last stop\n\nEthereum approaches a key technical indicator, and the outcome could dictate the asset's trajectory in the coming weeks. Currently, Ethereum's price hovers near a crucial point, engaging with the 50-day EMA.\n\nAt this juncture, the 50 EMA serves as the immediate resistance level. The ability of ETH to break above this mark is crucial \u2014 if successful, it could signal a return of bullish momentum, with potential targets set at higher resistance levels, such as the recent high around $2,436. Failure to breach this level, however, could spell trouble for Ethereum's short-term prospects.\n\nA rejection at the 50 EMA could lead to a price retracement toward the 100 EMA (the orange line), which is currently near the $2199.9 mark. This would not only negate the recent progress but could also result in bearish sentiment, potentially establishing a downward trend.\n\nFurther complicating the picture is the volume profile. The descending volume as the price approaches the 50 EMA suggests a lack of conviction among traders, which could imply that the push to overcome this resistance might not be supported by strong buying pressure. In market terms, a decrease in volume during a price increase often precedes a reversal, indicating that the current movement might lack the necessary fuel to sustain a breakout."

Following its smooth release, the upgrade is ready for its mainnet release and could arrive as early as March 2024.\n\nIn a series of tweets on X (formerly Twitter), developers announced that the next step for Dencun upgrade is the mainnet.

Terence did not see any bugs being reported yet.\n\nHolesky is finalized for Deneb.

If Ethereum price continues to climb higher, it could rally towards the 50% Fibonacci Retracement of Ethereum\u2019s decline between January 12 and 23, at $2,440.\n\nA successful break past this resistance at $2,440 could push ETH towards its target of $2,500. The green bars on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signal there is bullish momentum and Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 53.32, sustaining above the neutral level. These indicators support the thesis of Ethereum price increase.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nA daily candlestick close below the $2,267 support level could invalidate the bullish thesis for Ethereum and the altcoin could bleed to $2,164."

        "content": "ETH continued to trade above $2,300 despite the transfer.\n\nThe price might climb above $3,000 if market conditions improve.\n\nAccording to Spot On Chain, Ethereum [ETH] was part of the cryptocurrencies let go by defunct crypto exchange FTX and its sister firm Alameda.\n\nBased on the post, the firms sent 1,000 ETHs to Coinbase. However, the altcoin was not the only cryptocurrency affected by the sale.\n\nOthers included ALPHA, POWR, NEXO, and more. The sale was one of the numerous ones FTX and Alameda had been involved in recently.\n\nAs AMBCrypto reported earlier, the moves were in line with the go-ahead to offload some of their assets to pay back creditors and customers affected by the exchange crash.\n\nETH works under pressure\n\nHowever, ETH has been able to resist the selling pressure. At press time, the price of the altcoin was $2,321. According to the 4-hour chart, the 20 EMA (blue) and 50 EMA (yellow) were around the same area.\n\nThis trend suggested that ETH\u2019s next direction looked indecisive. As such, the price might keep hovering around the $2,300 region.\n\nIn terms of the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D), the indicator showed that there has been more accumulation than distribution.\n\nThis was confirmation that the participants were taking advantage of the dip and buying Ethereum at a discount.\n\nIf accumulation intensifies more than it has recently done, then ETH\u2019s price could rise to $2,500 in the short term.\n\nOn the other hand, a decline in the A/D would suggest distribution. If this is the case, ETH might become bearish while the price might fall as low as $2,215.\n\nHowever, this might not happen because of the signals shown by the Money Flow Index (MFI).\n\nThe MFI swings between 0 and 100. Values above 80 suggest that a cryptocurrency is overbought. On the other hand, a reading below 20 implies an oversold point.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s case, the MFI was 64.25, indicating that the level of buying pressure was enough to keep ETH above $2,300.\n\nFair enough! But more could be on the way\n\nAMBCrypto proceeded to check the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This ratio gives an idea if a cryptocurrency\u2019s value is fair, undervalued, or overvalued.\n\nValues of 3.7 indicate price tops. But when the MVRV ratio is less than 1, it implies that the price might have hit the bottom.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nETH\u2019s MRVR ratio was 1.51 according to data from Glassnode. This ratio implies that the altcoin was changing hands at a fair value during press time.\n\nHowever, this also means that ETH\u2019s long-term potential remains a bullish one. Should the market conditions improve, ETH\u2019s price might jump and a move toward $3,500 could be plausible."

As digital assets built on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies provide decentralized and secure transactions. However, the crypto space is not a monolith; it comprises various types of cryptocurrencies with distinct purposes and functionalities.Types of Cryptocurrencies:Bitcoin, created by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. Often referred to as digital gold, Bitcoin operates as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Its primary focus is on security and decentralization, making it a preferred choice for long-term investment.Altcoins, or alternative coins, encompass all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. These coins aim to address specific shortcomings in Bitcoin or introduce new features. Examples include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and many more. Ethereum, for instance, enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), expanding the use cases beyond simple transactions.Designed to minimize the volatility inherent in many cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the US Dollar or commodities like gold. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and DAI are popular stablecoins. These digital assets provide a reliable medium of exchange and a store of value while retaining the efficiency of blockchain technology.Utility tokens are native to specific blockchain platforms and serve as a means of accessing and utilizing features within that ecosystem. For example, Binance Coin (BNB) is used to pay for transaction fees on the Binance exchange, while Filecoin (FIL) is a utility token for decentralized file storage on the Filecoin network.Security tokens represent ownership of real-world assets such as real estate, stocks, or bonds. These tokens are subject to securities regulations, providing a bridge between traditional financial markets and blockchain technology. Security tokens offer fractional ownership and increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets.Privacy coins focus on enhancing user anonymity by implementing advanced cryptographic techniques. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) are examples of privacy coins that prioritize transaction privacy and fungibility. These coins appeal to users seeking enhanced confidentiality in their financial transactions.Some governments are exploring or developing their own digital currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by the central bank. These digital currencies aim to provide the benefits of blockchain technology while maintaining control over the monetary system."

        "content": "The prediction that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the Ethereum Spot ETF by 2024 has sparked a lot of interest in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nThis event would be notable as it signifies the second time a cryptocurrency would be listed on the New York exchange, following the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF earlier this year.\n\nDespite initial objections from some SEC officials, mounting pressure both internally and externally suggests that the regulator could finally give the Ethereum ETF the go-ahead.\n\nAnalysts believe the odds are high that several Ethereum ETFs will be approved this year. This forecast is based on a similar approval pattern as Bitcoin ETFs and the removal of Ethereum from the SEC\u2019s list of unregistered securities.\n\nThis expectation has generated a climate of optimism among cryptocurrency investors, who expect greater diversification and accessibility in the financial market.\n\nIt is expected that Ethereum\u2019s price could reach all-time highs again, reaching the $4,800.00 per ETH area following the ETF\u2019s approval.\n\nAnalysts suggest that Ethereum may not follow the same volatility patterns as Bitcoin, which could contribute to greater stability in its value. In addition, the potential approval of the Ethereum ETF is expected to have a significant bullish impact on the market, especially since Ethereum\u2019s Grayscale trust has a relatively small stake, meaning its liquidation would not exert significant selling pressure on ETH.\n\nThe eventual approval of the Ethereum ETF Spot could have a profound and lasting impact on the cryptocurrency market. In addition to representing greater legitimacy and accessibility for Ethereum, it is likely to generate renewed investor interest and wider adoption of the cryptocurrency across various financial sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential approval of the Ethereum ETF generates positive expectations and could represent a milestone in the evolution of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial markets.\n\nThis event is seen as an important step towards legitimacy and wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. The decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have a lasting impact on the market and spur greater investor interest in Ethereum.\n\nThe approval of this second ETF in 2024 has the potential to transform the global financial landscape and solidify the position of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream economy."

        "title": "After spot Bitcoin ETFs, is the spot Ethereum ETF approval next in line? - The Financial Express",
        "content": "As far as cryptocurrencies are concerned, it seems that the buzz for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is only getting started. Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications, which resulted in the cryptocurrency crossing the $47,000 level. Despite BTC\u2019s volatile nature, this step is believed to have bolstered the cryptocurrency\u2019s inclusion into traditional financial systems. So, what is next in store for this market? From what it\u2019s understood, the Ethereum blockchain has emerged as a likely candidate for spot ETF approval. \u201cI think Ethereum ETFs are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges and track the price of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. These ETFs can allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Investing in Ethereum ETFs can offer a way to gain exposure to Ethereum, which can bypass the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership,\u201d Sumit Ghosh, co-founder and CEO, Chingari, a Web3.0 live streaming application, told FE TransformX.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, an Ethereum ETF refers to a monetary instrument which helps supervise Ethereum\u2019s price changes and allows its trading on conventional stock exchanges. Market research suggests that Ethereum ETF-based investments should be taken into account based on factors such as diversification, which allows expansion of one\u2019s portfolio, liquidity, which enables share trading at stock exchanges, simplicity, which prevents one from the need of actually having Ethereum, accessibility, which permits Ethereum transactions using established brokerage accounts, and regulations, which keep Ethereum-based transactions under the supervision of conventional monetary markets. Going by media reports, a spot Ethereum ETF approval could be on its way as early as May 2024. While analysts of JPMorgan Chase & Co, a multinational finance corporation, have predicted a 50% chance of the spot Ethereum ETF approval happening in 2024, Matt Kunke, research analyst, GSR, a crypto market expertise platform, gave a 75% possibility through an official blog post. According to market experts, the principal cause behind SEC not yet authorising spot Ethereum ETFs is that the blockchain still hasn\u2019t been classified as either a security or a commodity, which can lead to regulatory drawbacks.\n\n\u201cI believe the Ethereum ETF approval would imitate the performance of Ethereum, providing access to Ether\u2019s (ETH) value but without the difficulties that come with owning the crypto. Along with accessibility, diversification in investment portfolios is one of the benefits. Ethereum could be more accessible to traditional investors, thus increasing the adoption of ETH which would bring higher liquidity to the ETH market. It has a less chance of being approved because the SEC hasn\u2019t given clarity on whether ETH is a security or not,\u201d Roshan Aslam, founder and CEO, GoSats, a BTC rewards platform, highlighted.\n\nAlso Read New study reveals abundant water sources on the Moon and not just on poles Kerala HC denies bail to Malayalam actor Siddique amid ongoing investigation in alleged rape case Oppo Find X8 could beat Apple iPhone 16 in this area IMD predicts light to moderate rain as monsoon retreats, no heavy rainfall alerts for Sept 20 \u2013 Check region-wise forecast\n\nAlso Read HTS Solutions Pvt Ltd\u2019s Pallav Agarwal on the need of affordable cloud solutions\n\nDespite mixed reactions around the Ethereum ETF approval timeline, market reports have shown Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency ETH to benefit largely from it. Insights from a report published by Standard Chartered, a multinational bank, has shown that ETH could clock a roughly 70% increase in value from its prevailing price and reach the $4,000 price level by May. Depending on how the spot BTC ETF approval increased ETH\u2019s price by nine percent to a 20-month high within 24 hours, traders are expected to look forward to the spot Ethereum ETF approval for more rise in ETH value. Standard Chartered has also given the prediction that ETH wouldn\u2019t have to endure the amount of selloffs that BTC endured after ETF authorisation. For example, the current Grayscale Ethereum Trust constitutes a lesser amount of total Ether market capitalisation in comparison to the BTC amount kept by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Reportedly, platforms which have applied for spot Ethereum ETFs include Hashdex, Ark Invest, Grayscale, BlackRock, VanEck, Invesco-Galaxy, and Fidelity. Overall, the spot BTC ETF authorisation is understood to have set the tone for spot Ethereum ETF approval in the second and third quarters of 2024. As of February 6, 2024 (1.26 pm, Indian Standard Time), Ethereum\u2019s value stood at nearly the $2,350 level with a total market capitalisation worth nearly $300 billion, as per CoinMarketCap, a crypto price-tracking website.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, the future of Ethereum ETFs seemingly depends on regulatory developments and market demand. If approved and launched in 2024, they could play a role in mainstreaming Ethereum and cryptocurrencies as investment assets. However, there are also risks and uncertainties, including regulatory hurdles and market volatility which could affect their success. Overall, Ethereum ETFs have the potential to reshape the crypto landscape by providing accessible and regulated investment opportunities for a wider range of investors,\u201d Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO, Unocoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, concluded.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "content": "Binance has unveiled its plans to list Ronin (RON) for trading.\n\nRonin is a pioneering blockchain gaming protocol that supports games like Axie Infinity.\n\nBinance, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, has announced its decision to list Ronin (RON), an Ethereum-based gaming project on its platform following the token\u2019s surge of over 108% in value over the past month.\n\nThe listing of Ronin on Binance marks a crucial moment for the project and highlights the growing importance of blockchain gaming in the broader crypto space.\n\nBinance\u2019s Support for Ronin\n\nBinance revealed its plans to support Ronin for trading in a blog post, stating that it would provide users with the opportunity to engage with this unique gaming token. To enhance user awareness and safety, Binance noted that it will attach a seed tag to RON, requiring traders to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they understand the risks associated with trading these tokens.\n\nThe new spot trading pairs for RON on Binance will include RONIN/BTC, RONIN/USDT, RONIN/FDUSD, and RONIN/TRY, offering users a variety of options to trade against popular cryptocurrencies. Deposits for RONIN have already commenced, with open trading for the spot trading pairs starting on February 5, at 13:30 (UTC). Withdrawals will become available on February 6, at 13:30 (UTC), providing users with full access to their RONIN holdings.\n\nNotably, RON was trading at $1.68 on January 8 and reached a high of $3.50 on Feb 6, representing a 108% rise. However, at the time of writing, RON has retraced by 3.6% and is trading at $2.87, with a market capitalization of $780 million.\n\nRonin, an EVM-compatible blockchain specifically tailored for Web3 gaming, has gained widespread recognition for its ability to scale gaming experiences to accommodate millions of daily active users. Developed by Sky Mavis, the team behind the popular gaming project Axie Infinity (AXS), Ronin stands out as a pioneering platform in the realm of blockchain gaming.\n\nHowever, Ronin has not been without its challenges. In March 2022, the platform experienced a security breach, resulting in a loss of over $600 million. Despite this setback, Sky Mavis swiftly identified the attacker and red-flagged the exploiter\u2019s address for purposes of investigation. Notably, Binance was among the key contributors to the compensation fund established to support victims of the hack, reaffirming its commitment to the security and resilience of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ronin has continued to thrive, with recent data indicating a surge in activity within the Ronin ecosystem. Market intelligence firm Nansen reported a staggering 368% increase in active addresses on Ronin in November 2023, highlighting the platform\u2019s growing popularity and adoption.\n\nCollaborations With Ronin\n\nIn addition to its listing on Binance, Ronin has forged strategic partnerships to further its mission of advancing blockchain gaming and NFT adoption.\n\nThe integration with Binance Pay, announced in December, streamlines the process of wallet funding for Ronin users, enhancing accessibility and usability within the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, Ronin has teamed up with Impossible Finance to deploy launchpad infrastructure for Web3 game launches. Calvin Chu, Core Builder of Impossible Finance, emphasized the potential of Ronin as a catalyst for the emergence of new projects, users, and communities, highlighting the synergies between the two platforms in driving the adoption of blockchain gaming and NFTs.\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nNovelty and explosive price movements go head-to-head in the crypto industry, and the latest novelty on the market is Pandora, the inaugural token leveraging the new ERC404 standard. This experimental token standard, a hybrid of ERC20 and ERC721, aims to blend the liquidity and fractionalization capabilities of these well-established protocols. Pandora's price has skyrocketed to over $8,600, marking a staggering 13-fold increase for some investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ERC404 standard is an ambitious attempt to marry the functionalities of ERC20 tokens, known for their fungibility, with ERC721 tokens. By doing so, ERC404 seeks to enable a novel form of asset representation that could potentially unlock new mechanisms for trading, ownership and asset interaction within the blockchain.\n\nThis standard employs a technique known as \"pathing,\" a method designed to allow for the coexistence of token amount data and identifiers within a unified framework, albeit with certain tradeoffs due to its experimental nature.\n\nThe dramatic ascent of Pandora's price is exemplified by the success story of a trader who turned a $97,484 investment into approximately $1.2 million in just two days. By purchasing 154 Pandora tokens at $633 and selling 25 of them at $7,548 each, the trader realized a profit of $91,211, with an outstanding holding valued at around $1.1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, each meteoric rise on the market is not so simple. The ERC404, while groundbreaking, is experimental and unaudited, suggesting that its integration and broader adoption come with inherent risks.\n\nThe rapid price increase of Pandora could potentially precipitate a sharp reversal, as history has shown with other crypto assets that have experienced similar parabolic uptrends. Investors and enthusiasts are thus advised to proceed with caution, bearing in mind the speculative nature of such investments and the uncharted territory that ERC404 tokens represent."

        "content": "It\u2019s a cypherpunk\u2019s dream: a stable cryptocurrency backed entirely by Ether, rather than real-world assets under the purview of hostile governments.\n\nBut RAI never took off. Its founder, prominent Ethereum developer Ameen Soleimani, hopes a newer version called HAI will prove decentralised stablecoins can thrive without being wedded to the dollar and, in turn, a central bank he believes is hellbent on gradually inflating away its value.\n\nPeople who hold a related token, KITE, will govern HAI. Beginning today, people who\u2019ve used RAI and the Optimism blockchain can check their eligibility for a February 13 airdrop of KITE.\n\n\u201cI would like to have money that doesn\u2019t get rugged \u2014 for me, for my friends, for everybody on the planet,\u201d Soleimani told DL News.\n\n\u201cBy providing an alternative, it\u2019s a check on other systems that might try to exploit you. So it\u2019s similar in ideology to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s proponents consider it a decentralised hedge against inflation, an appreciating asset beyond the reach of governments that often wield their control of money to cow dissidents. But it has been too volatile to serve as \u201celectronic cash\u201d as first envisioned.\n\nCrypto developers have long sought to fix that by creating decentralised stablecoins such as RAI and Liquity\u2019s LUSD. They have been mostly popular with DeFi natives, but Soleimani hopes that HAI, which is slated to launch February 20, will appeal to a broader range of people due to it its lower cost and a greater range of collateral assets.\n\nRAI vs HAI vs DAI\n\nLiquity accounted for a paltry 0.13% of the stablecoin market at the end of 2023, according to stablecoin ratings firm Bluechip. With a market capitalisation just under $5 million, RAI was even smaller: its share of the market was just 0.01%.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAbout $23 million in Ether backed RAI as of Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because both rely solely on deposits of Ether to back their stablecoins. That became less appealing after a pair of Ethereum upgrades that de-risked staking, a process in which investors lock up their Ether for a modest annual yield.\n\nUnlike RAI, HAI can be minted against multiple forms of collateral, such as Optimism\u2019s OP and liquid staking tokens like stETH. Users who hold a separate token called KITE will have a say over what collateral HAI will accept.\n\nIn a February 12 airdrop, the developers behind the new stablecoin will give away one-fifth of the KITE supply to about 18,000 crypto wallets that belong to people who have used RAI, Optimism, and a prototype version of HAI.\n\nHAI will exist on Optimism, a low-cost blockchain that settles on Ethereum for security purposes, technically called a layer 2 blockchain.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have multiple forms of collateral so that we could work with a broader base of users,\u201d Soleimani said, \u201cand we wanted to do it on a Layer 2 so that we could actually have smaller value loans and more everyday users can use it instead of, like, rich Ethereum whales.\u201d\n\nAnother decentralised stablecoin, Maker\u2019s DAI, gradually lost that moniker as it accepted greater amounts of centralised collateral in the form of USDC and US Treasuries.\n\nSoleimani said HAI could guard against mission drift by requiring a higher voting threshold to add collateral than to change other parameters; by delaying implementation of new collateral after a vote, giving anyone unhappy with the decision the opportunity to exit their position; and by limiting the amount of certain collateral users can deposit to mint HAI.\n\n\u2018Make more float coins\u2019\n\nHAI will also start trading at $1, rather than RAI\u2019s arbitrary $3.14 soft peg. RAI floats freely against that peg, but never too far from it. Similarly, HAI is expected to gradually drift from $1.\n\nSoleimani has taken to calling these tokens \u201cfloat coins.\u201d He hopes their popularity will show people that \u201cstability\u201d is not synonymous with tracking the value of the dollar.\n\nMarket values of top stablecoins\n\nTo ensure stability, it uses a self-correcting mechanism akin to a Chinese finger trap: the more someone tries to manipulate its value on the market, the more expensive the effort becomes.\n\nThe mechanism has worked well for RAI: according to data gathered by pseudonymous data analyst Kyoronut, RAI has been less volatile relative to the dollar than other world currencies.\n\nWhile Soleimani hopes HAI becomes a popular stablecoin, its market capitalisation isn\u2019t the only measure of success, he said.\n\nHAI\u2019s code is easy to copy, tweak, and deploy. Soleimani wants people to take advantage of that.\n\n\u201cMake more float coins,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the future that I want, instead of, like, going to the bank to get a loan against your farm or whatever, you and your friends \u2014 high tech farmers \u2014 would be able to make your own bank. You would have the digital tools to do so.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article was updated on January 7 to clarify that 18,000 wallets will receive KITE in an airdrop. The article originally stated 18,000 KITE would be distributed in the airdrop."

It uses the LLAMMA soft liquidation mechanism outlined in Curve co-founder Michael Egorov\u2019s crvUSD whitepaper.\n\nThis means that instead of loans hitting an all or nothing liquidation threshold \u2014 as they do on other lending markets such as Aave \u2014 Llamalend will liquidate delinquent positions gradually. The algorithm can even buy back sold collateral if prices recover.\n\nEgorov told DL News that he tentatively expects Llamalend to launch by the end of the week.\n\n(Full disclosure, DL News\u2019 founders were core contributors to the Curve protocol.)\n\nData of the week\n\nThe Ronin blockchain\u2019s TVL has increased 250% over the past three months. And since the start of the year, the number of stablecoins on Ronin has also jumped 36%.\n\nThe fact that users are depositing stablecoins to Ronin is important. It shows that the TVL increase isn\u2019t just due to the price increases of tokens already on Ronin, and that users are depositing new funds to the blockchain.\n\nAfter a long period of inactivity, stablecoin deposits to the Ronin blockchain are increasing.

        "content": "Crypto\u2019s latest decentralised social media app has taken center stage as users are now busy trading Farcaster IDs.\n\nEarly IDs have been eligible for various airdrops, likely driving trading activity.\n\nFarcaster is crypto Twitter\u2019s main character these days, attracting interest from many crypto notables, including Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin.\n\nTrading on Farmarket is booming, with users spending large on Farcaster IDs.\n\nSo far, the highest-selling FID on the Farcaster account marketplace earned the previous owner almost $7,000 in Ethereum.\n\nEarly joiners to Farcaster, an Optimism-based social media platform, claimed low FIDs \u2014 between one- to five-digit IDs. FIDs have now reached the six-digit level.\n\nFarcaster IDs are displayed as digits, with lower digit IDs attracting higher bids. They are also NFTs that can be bought and sold.\n\nUsers are offering each other as much as $34,000 for account NFTs on the Farcaster account marketplace FarMarket. (FarMarket)\n\nInterest in low FIDs is likely tied to some Farcaster apps having started airdropping viral meme coins to low-digit FIDs. One token called DEGEN has already surged 800% since late January, CoinGecko data shows.\n\n\u201cI think this is a fad that will die soon, and [that] is why I immediately listed my \u2018rare\u2019 FID for a reasonable price \u2014 top sale at the moment for 3 ETH,\u201d pseudonymous X user kcaz told DL News, referring to the hype around low FIDs.\n\nThey were the ones that sold the FID worth nearly $7,000, ID #4323.\n\nSecondary markets all the way down\n\nLaunched in August 2022, the protocol has over 293,000 users from over 41,000 Ethereum wallets and has already attracted several notable crypto personalities, including Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nSpeculative interest in low-digit crypto IDs is not a new phenomenon.\n\nLow-digit Ethereum Name Service names have also sold for thousands of dollars in the past with 000.eth selling in July 2022 for 300 ETH, worth $315,000 at the time.\n\nAs was the case for digit-ENS domains, tiered floor prices have also emerged for FIDs based on how low they are. The floor price is the lowest offer for an NFT and can be used to calculate the minimum value of an NFT collection.\n\nFIDs lower than 20,000 currently have a floor price of a few hundred dollars, Farmarket data shows.\n\nFarcaster on the rise\n\nThe speculative FID trend comes amid a broader increase in Farcaster adoption metrics.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s daily active user count soared 400% last week, coinciding with the protocol\u2019s launch of Frames \u2014 a feature letting users turn social posts on Warpcast into mini-apps for use cases like NFTs and gaming.\n\nWarpcast is one of the many apps built atop the Farcaster protocol. Many are touted as decentralised alternatives to popular web2 social media platforms. Warpcast is similar to X, formerly Twitter. Fancord resembles Discord.\n\nWhile Farcaster has enjoyed soaring metrics, its competition struggles to maintain pace.\n\nFriend.tech, last year\u2019s dominant SocialFi protocol, has seen its user numbers plummet 96% from its peak in September.\n\n\u201cBad gamefi is using financial speculation as a substitute for fun,\u201d tweeted Buterin, responding to commentary on Friend.tech\u2019s recent drop in user activity. \u201cI believe a similar thing for crypto social.\u201d\n\nThe Ethereum co-creator predicted that Farcaster, along with another web3 media protocol Lens, \u201cwill not be deserted in 4 months, or 1 year.\u201d\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nAs investors look for new opportunities, here are the top picks of 2024. Dogecoin, the infamous meme coin, and Ethereum have shown promising returns to investors with their recent boom. Meanwhile, at its five stage of the presale, Meme Moguls (MGLS) is causing a market buzz. With a significant surge of 225% in the first stage, Meme Moguls (MGLS) is set to become an investor favorite.\n\nElon Musk triggers a Dogecoin surge\n\nDogecoin is once again making headlines, thanks to the influential Elon Musk. The tech visionary behind Tesla liked an old post of his, consequently bringing a surge in the coin\u2019s value. The resurfaced tweet on X is dated October 31, 2021. It advocates his affinity for the meme coin by stating, \u201cTuition is in dogecoin; you get a discount if you own a dog.\u201d As a result, Dogecoin rode the waves of Musk\u2019s tweets, sparking conversations around upcoming updates.\n\nAs crypto enthusiasts anticipate Dogecoin\u2019s future, the meme coin witnesses a rise in its value. Experiencing a significant increase in its network activity, Dogecoin has been on the rise. In the past 24 hours, DOGE has surged by 1.16%.\n\nHowever, DOGE experienced a drop of 1.52% in the past week.

In a recent update, Ethereum core developer, Tim Beiko, took to Reddit to update enthusiasts regarding recent testing of the upcoming Dencun upgrade. The post states that the testing went well, and highlights the key point of the All Developer Execution Call.\n\nETH developers plan to set a launch date for the update on February 8. The much-awaited update is set to include many Ethereum improvement proposals (EIP), such as proto-dank sharding. It will also include alterations to Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers.\n\nThe Ethereum community eagerly awaits the update as the coin witnesses a price surge. In the past week, ETH rose by 3.45%. Similarly, showcasing a bullish pattern, in the past 24 hours, Ethereum experienced an uptick of 0.83%. The pioneering Ethereum token is currently trading hands at $2317.88.\n\nMeme Mogul catches the investor\u2019s eye\n\nInvestors in the market who are constantly on the lookout for the next big thing have set their eyes on Meme Moguls. Inspired by the moguls of the world who have left their mark, the Meme Moguls ecosystem allows investors to become moguls.\n\nLeveraging the power of the $2.3 billion meme industry, and the community-driven crypto movement, the Meme Moguls ecosystem is a perfect match for those looking to enhance their meme trading skills.\n\nWith an in-platform game, the Meme Moguls ecosystem helps investors learn how to invest and grow their wealth. The stimulating investment game enables users to connect with friends virtually and play trading games. Through this players can learn investment strategies, win cash prizes and rewards, and much more.\n\nThe ecosystem allows users to play for fun as well as create prize pools. With gaming modes such as Beat the Market, players can try to outperform indexes such as the S&P 500. MGLS players can become moguls and monetize their trading expertise by increasing market rankings.\n\nMoreover, with the P2E meme token, users can contribute their Meme Moguls tokens to the staking pool and earn rewards. Analysts predict a 100x return on this meme coin as it heads to the fifth stage of presale. At its current price of $0.0036, investors are enthusiastic about the $10,000 giveaway set to take place at the end of each MGLS presale.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls\n\n*This article was paid for.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, dipped below the $43,000 mark early Tuesday. Other top coins, including the likes of \u2014 Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) \u2014 saw minor gains and losses across the board. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token emerged to be the biggest gainer of the lot, with a 24-hour jump of over 13 percent. Ronin (RON), on the other hand, became the biggest loser, with a 24-hour dip of over 25 percent.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at $1.64 trillion at the time of writing, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.42 percent.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Today\n\nBitcoin price stood at $42,792.43, registering a 24-hour gain of 0.27 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.

As per WazirX, SOL price in India stood at Rs 8,401.\n\nTop Crypto Gainers Today (February 6)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto gainers over the past 24 hours:\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS)\n\nPrice: $20.80\n\n24-hour gain: 13.70 percent\n\nSui (SUI)\n\nPrice: $1.59\n\n24-hour gain: 8.87 percent\n\nOptimism (OP)\n\nPrice: $3.21\n\n24-hour gain: 7.02 percent\n\nGnosis (GNO)\n\nPrice: $231.89\n\n24-hour gain: 6.05 percent\n\nImmutable (IMX)\n\nPrice: $2.26\n\n24-hour gain: 5.97 percent\n\nTop Crypto Losers Today (February 6)\n\nAs per CoinMarketCap data, here are the top five crypto losers over the past 24 hours:\n\nRonin (RON)\n\nPrice: $2.53\n\n24-hour loss: 25.69 percent\n\nPyth Network (PYTH)\n\nPrice: $0.465\n\n24-hour loss: 7.43 percent\n\nFlare (FLR)\n\nPrice: $0.02913\n\n24-hour loss: 6.67 percent\n\nInternet Computer (ICP)\n\nPrice: $12.17\n\n24-hour loss: 6.19 percent\n\nOasis Network (ROSE)\n\nPrice: $0.1121\n\n24-hour loss: 3.55 percent\n\nWhat Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About Current Market Scenario\n\nMudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin held its position above the $42,000 mark despite a 14 basis points increase in the 10-year US Treasury bond yield. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's statement that the Fed had little intention to cut rates in March did not shake the bullish sentiment, with the $42,000 level being defended. Despite this, the $42,000 level has seen defence by bullish investors. The next resistance for BTC is at $43,800, with support at $41,300. Meanwhile, Ethereum is presently at the $2,300 mark, with a potential bullish move anticipated if it surpasses $2,400, aiming for $2,600. Until then, Ethereum is expected to trade sideways.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cAs BTC has been trading in a narrow channel for more than a week now, the up-trend still remains intact with $42k being the level to break on the down side and $44k on the up-side. However with Blackrock now holding more than $2 billion worth of BTC, bears will have to instill some massive amount of fear for breaking it to the downside. One of the biggest news from yesterday came from GoDaddy. The company announced that its users can now link domain names with Ethereum Name Service, ENS (+13%) at no extra cost. This is a big boost for both Ethereum (+1.68%) and the ENS token.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cThe potential liquidation of Genesis's assets could exert a negative impact on market prices. The selling pressure that started after the approval of spot BTC ETFs persists, influencing the market ahead of the anticipated Genesis sell-off. Bitcoin's price has retreated from $43,000 levels and faces a challenging struggle to avoid a further decline back to the $40,000 support level, which held during the bullish market sentiment at the end of last year. Ethereum's pricing signals indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential lull at the resistance level and a possible market downturn. Contrary to market expectations of a rally, XRP continues its downward trajectory, surprising investors. The Relative Strength Index signals oversold conditions amid a bearish sentiment, with moving averages indicating a prevailing 'Sell' sentiment.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe total crypto market cap stands around $1.64T, a 0.73% increase over the last day. The selling pressure by Grayscale which has sold 141,00 Bitcoin is being absorbed by 175,000 Bitcoin bought through ETFs.The Cumulative spot Bitcoin ETF volume has also crossed the $30B threshold reflects a huge demand for Bitcoin in the Spot ETFs. Bitcoin has persistently attempted to breach the $44,000 level for several weeks but it has been hindered by low trading volume.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin's January surge in trading volume to $16.01 billion, the most since September 2022, pushed its value past $43,000. Factors such as reduced grayscale bitcoin sales and a strong US stock market contributed to this. Upcoming events, including the US Federal Reserve meeting, can affect market trends. Despite the potential uncertainty, Bitcoin's market capitalization rose 2% to $1.66 trillion in 24 hours. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's plan to cut interest rates three times in 2024 aims to take advantage of the strong US economy and control inflation. Crypto analyst DonAlt predicts that Bitcoin could reach $60,000 if it clears key barriers and maintains a bullish outlook.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, the crypto market initially remained stable but later saw a decline, impacted by the fall in the US market and Coinbase shares. The overall market has been relatively quiet recently as BTC consolidates around the $43,000 level. However, on a higher time frame, BTC exhibits a bullish trend with confirmations from EMAs. ETH is following a similar price action to BTC, and both cryptocurrencies need to break out of their current consolidations to signal a significant move in either direction.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

BTC is currently consolidating above the $42,500 support zone but has not yet surpassed the $43,500 resistance, indicating a potential lack of momentum for a substantial upward movement. If BTC closes below the support level, a bearish trend may follow. Meanwhile, Ethereum is making efforts to stabilize above $2,328, with the next resistance at $2,400.\u201d\n\nCoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, \u201cAs BTC (+0.3%) continues to trade in the uptrend narrow channel, its volatility continues to be on the lower side. BTC has already printed five consecutive monthly green candles in the wake of the recent ETF and upcoming halving in April. It should be interesting to see if we see one more monthly green close as it has only happened once in the last 7 years. Facing headwinds, XMR saw a decline of 30% after Binance delisted the privacy token. According to @monero handle on X, the delisting is happening because the exchange requires all deposits to come from a publicly transparent address, which is not possible by design for a privacy coin like XMR. Its futures pair however will continue to trade as usual.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin recently fell below $43,000 amid swings in the US stock market, yet held resiliently above $42,000, supported by \"buy the dip\" sentiment. Despite rising US Treasury yields and Powell's remarks tempering rate cut expectations, Cathie Wood's bullish stance attributing Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" boosts investor confidence. Conversely, the approaching Hong Kong crypto exchange licensing deadline brings initial uncertainty, but underscores growing acceptance by regulators, potentially strengthening bitcoin's legitimacy and stability. Technical analysis shows Bitcoin facing resistance at $42,895 and support at $41,444, with RSI indicating balance and MACD indicating bearish pressure. Overall, Bitcoin's cautious market stance suggests optimism above $42,200, signaling potential upside momentum if it sustains or breaks through.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cBitcoin's pre-halving surge has overshadowed market sentiment related to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. In recent weeks, increased activities on the Bitcoin network and growing use cases for BRC 20 have driven prices upward, despite uncertainty surrounding Genesis's asset sell-off. Bitcoin\u2019s price movement is predicted to be stable with an increased inflow leading up to the pre-halving stage and ETF exposure. While the market is still moving sideways, it has managed to ward off volatility despite external conditions.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe Crypto market has experienced a slight increase overnight with Bitcoin regaining $43,000 and Ethereum almost crossing $2400. Market data shows that institutional investors remain highly bullish on Bitcoin. Microstrategy, a business intelligence enterprise known for its strong Bitcoin support has reported the acquisition of an additional 850 BTC for $37.2 million and now holds a total of a staggering 190,000 BTC. At the same time,the Bitcoin spot ETF craze has not slowed down as BlackRock and Fidelity now own a combined of 138,489 BTC which is roughly worth around $5.9 billion in Bitcoin. All these moves only reflect positive institutional sentiments around Bitcoin before the halving.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cIn the past 24 hours, the crypto market stayed stable, with ETH showing stronger performance compared to BTC, as indicated by the rising ETH/BTC pair. BTC continued to hover below the crucial resistance zone of $44,000-$45,000, remaining in a consolidation phase.ETH, on the contrary, approached the upper boundary of its range at $2,380, currently holding just below it. It's also above the 20 and 50 Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which is a positive signal.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

A \u201cGreed\u201d reading suggests that investors are currently optimistic about the cryptocurrency market, but can also be an indication that the market is overvalued. A \u201cFear\u201d reading, on the other hand, signals that investors are currently hesitant about the cryptocurrency market, which potentially represents a buying opportunity.\n\nEthereum moving averages & oscillators\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what some of the most important technical indicators are signaling. We\u2019ll be going through key moving averages and oscillators that will allow us to get a better idea of how Ethereum is positioned in the market right now.\n\nPeriod Daily Simple Daily Exponential Weekly Simple Weekly Exponential MA3 $ 2,372.86 (BUY) $ 2,342.19 (BUY) - - MA5 $ 2,315.28 (BUY) $ 2,342.89 (BUY) - - MA10 $ 2,275.38 (BUY) $ 2,316.66 (BUY) - - MA21 $ 2,319.52 (BUY) $ 2,241.23 (BUY) $ 3,083.51 (SELL) $ 2,068.40 (BUY) MA50 $ 2,321.73 (BUY) $ 2,087.63 (BUY) $ 2,685.39 (SELL) $ 1,923.03 (BUY) MA100 $ 2,196.73 (BUY) $ 1,955.41 (BUY) $ 1,545.55 (BUY) $ 1,888.48 (BUY) MA200 $ 1,976.76 (BUY) $ 1,861.02 (BUY) $ 2,148.26 (BUY) $ 1,666.57 (BUY)\n\nPeriod Value Action RSI (14) 46.87 NEUTRAL Stoch RSI (14) 100.00 SELL Stochastic Fast (14) 61.00 NEUTRAL Commodity Channel Index (20) -66.67 NEUTRAL Average Directional Index (14) 7.31 NEUTRAL Awesome Oscillator (5, 34) -60.55 NEUTRAL Momentum (10) 34.04 NEUTRAL MACD (12, 26) -3.45 NEUTRAL Williams Percent Range (14) -39.00 NEUTRAL Ultimate Oscillator (7, 14, 28) 47.26 NEUTRAL VWMA (10) 2,306.87 BUY Hull Moving Average (9) 2,309.05 SELL Ichimoku Cloud B/L (9, 26, 52, 26) 2,441.28 NEUTRAL\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) is a widely used indicator that helps inform investors whether an asset is currently overbought or oversold. The RSI 14 for Ethereum is at 46.87, suggesting that ETH is currently neutral.\n\nThe 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA 50) takes into account the closing price of Ethereum over the last 50 days.

ETH would have to increase by 8.10% to hit our $ 2,538.89 target within the next five days. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor the ETH market sentiment, the key support and resistance levels, and other metrics.

        "title": "Ethereum adds nearly 100,000 new unique addresses daily in 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH) has consistently grown in adoption, usage, and value over the years. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the leading Web3 and DeFi blockchain.\n\nInterestingly, the number of unique addresses in the network is an insightful metric to look at and evidence this growth. For that, Finbold retrieved data from Etherscan on February 7, which shows nearly 257.60 million current unique addresses.\n\nIn particular, users created nearly 3.54 million new addresses in 2024, from 254.07 million registered on January 1. On average, 2024\u2019s daily increase of Ethereum unique addresses was 95,570, adding 96,145 on February 6 alone.\n\nEthereum unique addresses 2024 chart. Source: Etherscan\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that new unique addresses do not necessarily mean new users or active usage. One user can hold multiple addresses, which can go inactive over history.\n\nEthereum new unique addresses throughout history\n\nThroughout its history, Ethereum has added over 82,000 daily unique addresses, on average, since July 30, 2015.\n\nNotably, its real surge started in 2018 and has increased nearly 14 times until today, from less than 18.5 million unique addresses registered on December 31, 2017. This means an increase of 239.1 million addresses since January 1, 2018, or a daily average of 108,000.\n\nEthereum unique addresses historical chart. Source: Etherscan\n\nThe daily average since 2018 is higher than the averages since Ethereum\u2019s mainnet launch in 2015 and 2024\u2019s latest data. This highlights how expressive these past six years were for adoption but shows a recent decrease in addresses\u2019 activation.\n\nCurrent ETH\u2019s price action could have influenced the unique address creation slow pace, following 2017\u2019s and 2021\u2019s bull markets.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum thrives in relevant DeFi metrics, such as dominating over 50% of the total value locked (TVL) in all chains. Protocols built on top of ETH are their category leaders in TVL and decentralized exchanges (DEX) volume, like Uniswap (UNI).\n\nEthereum can continue growing while the network attracts investments, builders, and users. On the other hand, layer-1 competitors to Web3 and DeFi have been surging with technological advancements, higher scalability, and better user experience (UX).\n\nThus, the Ethereum ecosystem must learn to evolve and adapt in the highly competitive free market of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Mantra Network Set to Challenge Ethereum L1 Dominance \u2014 Should You Buy OM Tokens? - CoinChapter",
        "content": "MANTRA Network\n\nNOIDA (CoinChapter.com) \u2014 Blockchain project MANTRA (OM) price reached its highest level since Dec. 2021 after the DeFi platform\u2019s proposal to make OM its native token passed with overwhelming support. In other words, OM is now challenging Ethereum, the leading layer-one project by market cap.\n\nNotably, MANTRA is a blockchain project that is built around the MANTRA DAO, a community-governed DeFi platform that offers users a range of financial services, including staking, lending, and decentralized governance.\n\nSome of the products that MANTRA offers include MANTRA Finance, for trading and earning on crypto and tokenized assets, and MANTRA Chain, for building Web3 applications\n\nMANTRA Community Approves OM As Native L1 Token\n\nAfter a recent vote, the MANTRA community made a pivotal decision regarding its native token. Opting against the introduction of a new token, AUM, the community voted in favor of the OM token becoming the native L1 token.\n\nThe call for changing the native token for the MANTRA Network resulted in widespread confusion, with existing OM holders worried that their token holdings\u2019 value would be depleted. The community, therefore, voted to keep OM as the native token to simplify the MANTRA ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, keeping OM as the native token would allow holders to take advantage of the hype around the MANTRA mainnet launch. A new native token, AUM, in this case, would have diminished the bullish impact of the main net launch for both tokens.\n\nMANTRA noted that the OM token proposal passed with overwhelming community support.\n\nAfter voting ended, the decision to promote the OM token as the main L1 token once the main net goes live passed with 99.95% of the votes. The adoption of OM as the native L1 token opens up new use cases for the MANTRA token, such as in governance and in utility.\n\nFurthermore, the decision would likely attract more buyers to the market, favoring the MANTRA network token. Given the strong community support, it is likely OM supporters would be pushing for a spot ETF for the MANTRA token.\n\nOM Price Dips Post Adoption News\n\nMeanwhile, OM\u2019s price failed to react to the bullish cue. The MANTRA token dropped over 23% after reaching $0.192 on Feb. 4, OM price\u2019s highest level since Dec. 2021.\n\nThe price dip indicates that many in the MANTRA community booked profits after voting for OM as the only native token for the DeFi platform. However, OM price has had a very bullish run since Dec. 2023, spiking nearly 714% from Dec. 4\u2019s low near $.0236 to reach its recent high on Feb. 4.\n\nOMUSD daily price chart with RSI. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nIf the MANTRA token price continues to fall, OM would likely end up testing the support near $0.125. Moreover, breaching the immediate support might force OM price to drop to the 50-day EMA (purple wave) support near $0.085 before recovering.\n\nHowever, news of the MANTRA Network adopting OM as its native L1 token might help bulls push OM price to the resistance near $0.193. Flipping the immediate resistance might help propel the crypto token to the resistance near $0.234 before corrections pare gains.\n\nThe RSI for OM was marginally overbought, scoring 70.11 on the daily charts."

        "title": "Algotech (ALGT) Shows Early Signs of Presale Success as Investors Watch for Other Opportunities on Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) - Coinfomania",
        "content": "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is right on the heels of the Ether token, looking to get some surge from the recent talk on ETH spot ETFs, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is navigating a bearish wave in a market where the BCH price could go either way. Algotech (ALGT) has shown signs of a huge entry from its $1.1 million private seed sale, and its presale is currently pushing boundaries.\n\nTLDR\n\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) price surge follows speculation on Ethereum spot ETFs.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash price tries for a resistance break at $238.39 as bearish predictions loom .\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) presale is offering more than massive profits .\n\nEthereum Classic Price Shoots as ETC Token Looks to Benefit From ETH Profits\n\nNews of Bitcoin\u2019s ETF approval dominated the crypto-verse for the past two months as the ETFs moved from speculation to reality. With Bitcoin\u2019s trading vehicles in motion, analysts expect Ethereum spot ETFs to hit the market before the year ends. Bitcoin\u2019s ETFs are stale news already, and the Ethereum Classic price is already pumped for an ETH price surge.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) dipped along with the rest of the top altcoins in January, but ETC is rising back up pretty quickly. Within the past seven days, the Ethereum Classic (ETC) value has climbed way ahead of the general crypto market, attaining bullish rankings on multiple analyses, including those from Investor Observer.\n\nA peek at the price prediction for Ethereum Classic (ETC) shows that CoinCodex gives the token a bullish $37.60 target for the next month, as its current surge has seen the Ethereum Classic price beat its $24 resistance. ETC could turn out to be one of the top altcoins to watch in 2024.\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Could Hit Bearish Waters as BCH Attempts To Break Resistance\n\nUnlike Ethereum Classic (ETC), the Bitcoin Cash price surge following the Bitcoin ETFs rally in December was short-lived. BCH is still quite bearish at the moment, as it is trying to push against the looming $238.39 resistance. While many analysts concede that BCH has room to navigate a comeback, there is little hope in a bullish Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price for now.\n\nFollowing the January dip, traders across exchanges have been shorting Bitcoin Cash (BCH), contributing to its bearish conditions. However, a crypto intelligence tracker, Santiment, states that a mass liquidation following the shorting of the coin might lead to a surge in Bitcoin Cash price.\n\nWith Investor Observer ranking Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as a low-volatility token, there will be little price manipulation in the near future. BCH might also be a top crypto to invest in for the future since Bitcoin\u2019s halving might have bullish effects on Bitcoin Cash price, too.\n\nAlgotech (ALGT) Presale Is Rocking the Crypto-verse!\n\nMost presales have come and gone with little impressions and even less to gain from them.

        "title": "GoDaddy and Ethereum Name Service Connect Domain Names to Crypto Wallets - News Welcome",
        "content": "In recent times, we may have seen an increasing trend of blending traditional web technologies with the developing world of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This trend of merging is also now reflected in a recent partnership between GoDaddy, a leading domain registrar, and the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a pioneering Blockchain-based naming system. This collaboration is intended to simplify the connection between conventional domain names and crypto wallets and offers exciting possibilities for both individuals and businesses.\n\nConnecting the Dots- Linking Domain Names to ENS Addresses\n\nTo understand this concept, here is an example! Consider you own a domain yourname.com and you can conveniently link it to your crypto wallet address, say yourname.eth. This is precisely what the GoDaddy-ENS partnership enables. Users can now connect their domains with their ENS addresses for free, thereby getting rid of the technical complexities and high gas fees that previously hindered this process.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nThis integration offers a myriad of benefits:\n\nSimplified crypto management- Linking your domain to your ENS address creates a single, memorable point of access for all your digital assets, which will then aid in streamlining crypto management and make it more user-friendly.\n\nEnhanced security- You can leverage the credibility of GoDaddy\u2019s global brand and the decentralized security of ENS. This way, you can ensure protection for your digital identity.\n\nBridging traditional and decentralized web \u2013 This collaboration is also intended to bridge the gap between the familiar DNS system and the emerging Web3 ecosystem and opens new possibilities for businesses and individuals.\n\nThe implications of this partnership do not only apply to managing crypto assets. Imagine using your yourname.eth address as a universal identifier for accessing decentralized applications (dApps), online communities, and even Metaverse experiences. This integration leads to paving the way for a more unified and consistent online identity across both Web2 and Web3 platforms.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities Ahead\n\nWhile the recent cryptocurrency downturn put the brakes on Web3 adoption by major companies, the partnership between ENS and GoDaddy could signal a resurgence of interest in bridging the gap between traditional technology and Blockchain.\n\nAt the same time, while this collaboration represents a significant step forward, challenges are still there. Regulatory environments surrounding crypto are still evolving, and widespread adoption will require ongoing efforts to educate users and businesses. Additionally, ensuring the security and stability of this integrated system within a dynamic environment is crucial.\n\nLooking Ahead- A Glimpse into the Future\n\nThe successful integration of traditional domain names with Blockchain-based naming systems like Ethereum Name Service could fundamentally reshape how we interact with the internet. It holds the very potential to simplify crypto management, improve security, and provide new opportunities for businesses and individuals in the increasingly interconnected world of Web2 and Web3. While the future will reveal which way this goes, the GoDaddy and ENS partnership marks a significant milestone in this ongoing evolution, and its impact will be closely watched by the ones interested in the future of the internet.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/godaddy-and-ethereum-name-service-simplify-connecting-domain-names-and-crypto-wallets-for-customers-302053466.html\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/02/05/web-registry-godaddy-ethereum-name-service-connect-domain-names-with-crypto-wallets/\n\n\n\n\n\n"
