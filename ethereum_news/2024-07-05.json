Since the beginning of this week, the world's largest digital asset has slumped 9.5%, nearly 21% down from its all-time high clocked earlier this year.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, also crashed to a six-week low, erasing all the gains made since the hype of spot ETF approvals in mid-May.\n\nThe sell-offs were precipitated by the movement of 47,228 Bitcoin, worth $2.7 billion, by defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox from a cold wallet to a new wallet, possibly in preparation for payouts to its creditors.\n\nThe slump forced the largest wave of liquidations since mid-April, as $541.45 million in future contracts was wiped out in the last 24 hours. Long liquidations accounted for a whopping $472 million.\n\nBitcoin's Open Interest plunged 7% in the last 24 hours.

        "title": "When Will Ethereum Price Recover? - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nThis past week, Ethereum has witnessed a massive sell-off crisis, with the price dropping below $2,900.\n\nA recent report by CoinShares highlights that Ethereum has experienced a massive capital outflow, the largest since August 2022, with total losses amounting to $119 million over the last couple of weeks.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nThis continues a trend from a week ago, when Ethereum's price dropped from a high of $3,887 to a low of $3,232, marking a 16.9% loss. Even though ETH's price may be stagnating at the moment, a surge in staking indicates that existing users believe in the long-term potential of ETH.\n\nIn wake of ETF launch\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, multiple applicants are supposed to submit their amended S-1 forms before July 8. This could mean that the final approval of S-1 forms is expected to take place by July 12, while the launch could happen somewhere the following week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsset managers are optimistic that the SEC will approve the first U.S. ETFs that invest directly in Ether by mid-July. There was earlier market speculation that approval would come during the July 4 holiday week.\n\nHowever, the SEC has informed Ether exchange-traded fund applicants that they have until July 8 to submit updated paperwork. There might be another round of filings after this date.\n\nSome experts, such as Eric Balchunas, point out to an unnecessary pause on the SEC part.\n\nNo one really knows why the SEC is taking their sweet time with these, given how light comments were, these could have easily been trading by now. Could be one 'problem' issuer slowing down process or just summertime lazy/ppl on vaca. Not sure. That said, all indications launch\u2026 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 3, 2024\n\nThe SEC\u2019s feedback to issuers consisted of minor questions that are now being addressed. In May, the SEC approved a proposal by exchanges to list these products, but a separate approval is needed before they can be launched.\n\nGalaxy Digital\u2019s head of asset management believes that spot Ether ETFs will be approved in \u201cweeks\u201d rather than days but agrees the decision will come sometime in July.\n\nWho's joining in?\n\nAsset manager Bitwise has filed an amended S-1 form for an Ethereum exchange-traded fund ahead of its July 8 deadline, indicating the products are nearly ready for launch. Other firms, including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, 21Shares and Invesco, also have filings waiting for approval.\n\nMany issuers have yet to disclose the fees on their respective funds, which is necessary before trading can begin.\n\nWill price follow?\n\nEther has underperformed relative to Bitcoin for over a year, with Bitcoin posting significant gains bolstered by over $14 billion in flows to its spot ETFs in 2024.\n\nThe anticipated launch of ETH ETFs on July 8 could be a \"golden egg\" for Ether's price action. However, Bitcoin is expected to face sell pressure as $8.5 billion worth is returned to creditors of the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox starting this week, according to a report by K33 analysts.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe 100 EMA frequently serves as a reliable gauge of the general trend, and a break below it could trigger a large sell-off. Having currently regained the critical $3,000 level, Ether now needs to reclaim the $3,360 support level before July 8. If it fails, the short-term rally might be paused."

        "content": "Ethereum ETF, Uniswap V4, and Cardano upgrade aim to enhance market accessibility and efficiency in Q3.\n\nKey Takeaways Ethereum ETF launch expected to attract institutional investors in Q3 2024.\n\nCardano's Chang hard fork aims to implement decentralized governance by July's end.\n\nShare this article\n\nThree major catalysts are set to impact the crypto market in Q3 2024, according to the latest edition of IntoTheBlock\u2019s newsletter \u201cOn-chain Insights\u201d. The events include the trading start of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US, the Uniswap V4 release, and Cardano\u2019s Chang hard fork.\n\nThe Ethereum ETF is expected to launch this quarter, potentially attracting institutional investors. Analysts at IntoTheBlock predict ETH ETF inflows could reach 30% of those seen during the Bitcoin ETF introduction, which saw $5 billion in net inflows over its first five months.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Image: IntoTheBlock\n\nAs reported by Crypto Briefing, asset management firm Bitwise\u2019s CIO predicted that Ethereum ETFs could attract $15 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nUniswap, the largest decentralized exchange by total value locked, plans to release its V4 version. This is the second development in crypto seen by IntoTheBlock analysts as a potential catalyst for prices in Q3.\n\nNotably, the V4 update introduces \u201chooks\u201d for customization, dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, and time-weighted average market maker functionality.\n\nCurrent profitability of UNI holders. Image: IntoTheBlock\n\nMoreover, Cardano aims to implement the Chang hard fork by the end of July, introducing decentralized, community-run governance. The Chang upgrade will proceed once 70% of stake pool operators have tested and updated their systems.\n\nThis is also a development in crypto that could boost prices in this quarter, the analysts pointed out.\n\nThese developments follow historical trends of catalysts boosting asset values. During the month leading up to Cardano\u2019s last hard fork in September 2021, ADA\u2019s price increased by 130%, rising from $1.35 to $3.10.\n\nThe On-chain Insights newsletter also mentions the application for a Solana ETF made by Bitcoin ETF issuers VanEck and 21Shares, further expanding institutional crypto access. Although it is unlikely to get approved in 2024, much less in Q3, this movement could boost investors\u2019 sentiment."

        "content": "How will the recent market crash impact Ethereum price prediction? Experts weigh in on potential outcomes.\n\nThe crypto market experienced extreme turbulence over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, plummeted to a new low of $53,700 on July 5.\n\nThe market-wide sell-off intensified following reports that Mt. Gox, the infamous collapsed crypto exchange, transferred over 47,000 BTC (worth approximately $2.6 billion) to a new wallet in preparation for a large-scale payout totaling about 142,000 BTC (valued at $7.9 billion at current prices).\n\nYou might also like: Why Bitcoin could stay low until October: What analysts are saying\n\nOn July 5, during Friday\u2019s Asian trading hours, the Mt. Gox trustee officially confirmed that the exchange had made repayments in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash to some of the rehabilitation creditors, although the exact amount of BTC sent wasn\u2019t specified.\n\nThe ripple effect of this panic selling spread across the altcoin market, leading to more pronounced declines. Ethereum (ETH), along with nearly all top ten altcoins, crashed by 10-20%, with Ethereum losing the crucial support level of $3,000, marking the biggest decline since the FTX crash.\n\nLargest liquidation event since the FTX collapse wow pic.twitter.com/BsCtDHkXTz \u2014 merts.eth (@merts_eth) July 5, 2024\n\nAccording to Coinglass data, over the past 24 hours, 221,704 traders have been liquidated. Bitcoin\u2019s total liquidations reached $200 million, while Ethereum\u2019s stood at around $160 million.\n\nDespite this turmoil, BTC has shown some signs of recovery, trading around $55,400 as of July 5. However, Ethereum hasn\u2019t been as fortunate, trading below the $3,000 mark at $2,940, marking a 6.75% decline in the last 24 hours and approximately 15% over the week.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the major events impacting Ethereum and explore what we can expect in terms of Ethereum price predictions.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum\u2019s future looks busy and potentially transformative. One of the most anticipated developments is the launch of Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nAsset manager Bitwise has recently filed an amended S-1 form for an Ethereum ETF, indicating that these products are almost ready for launch. The deadline for this filing was July 8, and it suggests that we might see these ETFs trading soon.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum at $10,000? Here\u2019s how the first spot ETH ETF could make it happen\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart mentioned on social media that Bitwise\u2019s amended S-1 form is a positive sign. He expects more issuers to follow suit in the coming days, predicting that these ETFs could potentially start trading as early as next week or the week of July 15.\n\nUPDATE: We've got another amended S-1 from @BitwiseInvest for their #Ethereum ETF. Expect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week. We're thinking these things could potentially list later next week or the week of the 15th at this point. pic.twitter.com/xqVlt9lSGy \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 3, 2024\n\nThis move comes after the SEC approved 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs on May 23, which included Bitwise. However, for these ETFs to begin trading, their S-1 statements must become effective as part of a two-step regulatory process.\n\nEric Balchunas, another senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, noted that the SEC\u2019s delay in approving these ETFs has been puzzling, given the minimal comments received.\n\nHe speculates that the delay might be due to one problematic issuer or simply the usual summertime slow pace with people on vacation. Despite these delays, all indications point to a launch this month.\n\nThe introduction of Ethereum ETFs is crucial because it allows more investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly buying the cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, in light of the current market uncertainties and bearish sentiment, it remains uncertain how impactful these ETFs might be on Ethereum\u2019s price appreciation.\n\nExperts take on what is brewing?\n\nFollowing the recent market turmoil, experts have shared insights into what may lie ahead for Ethereum and the entire crypto market.\n\nAli, a crypto analyst, mentioned a large capital outflow from the market. In March, the market held over $110 billion, but now it has dwindled to just $20 billion, indicating waning investor confidence that could continue to exert downward pressure on prices.\n\nAli also discussed the current crypto cycle, mentioning the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise of meme coins, and celebrities launching their own altcoins, asking if the market has already reached its peak. He suggested that BTC needs to surpass $61,000 levels for the bull run to resume.\n\n#Bitcoin currently lacks significant support. The main key demand wall is around $47,000, and for the bull run to resume, $BTC must close and hold above $61,000. pic.twitter.com/9cD2otd4ZK \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) July 5, 2024\n\nAmid this, Peter Schiff, a prominent crypto critic, expressed concerns about Ethereum breaking key support levels and trading below $2,900, marking a 30% decline from its March high.\n\n#Ethereum is also breaking key support. It's trading below $2,900, down 30% from its March high. I think a crash down to $1,500 is coming. It looks like those buying the #Ether ETF rumors couldn't wait for the fact to sell. pic.twitter.com/XXEyX67BXK \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 5, 2024\n\nSchiff believes Ethereum could decline further to $1,500, noting that investors who were anticipating Ether ETFs are now selling off before these products launch.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, another crypto analyst, pointed out that Ethereum has hit its lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart since August 2023.\n\n#Ethereum reaches the lowest RSI (Daily) since the collapse in August '23.#Altcoins have reached their lowest RSI (Daily) ever or of this cycle.\n\n\n\nClear capitulation. pic.twitter.com/9eehaITkQI \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 5, 2024\n\nHe also noted that many altcoins are experiencing their lowest RSI levels ever, indicating stark market capitulation.\n\nMeanwhile, another crypto analyst, offered a more optimistic view. He acknowledged that while the current pullback is challenging, it remains relatively minor compared to previous cycles.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the current pullback would still be relatively minor in the previous cycles.\n\n\n\nWe've been through worse.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Q4vQsxqgZ8 \u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) July 5, 2024\n\nEthereum price prediction: a bounceback possible?\n\nAs we look ahead, many experts have shared their Ethereum predictions for the coming years. Let\u2019s break it down year by year.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2024\n\nFor 2024, Digitalcoinprice forecasts that Ethereum\u2019s price could range from a minimum of $2,648.22 to a maximum of $6,412.82, with an average price of $6,166.53.\n\nCoincodex is slightly more optimistic, predicting that by August 4, Ethereum\u2019s price might rise by 4.10% to around $3,005.95.\n\nThese predictions suggest some growth, but the market sentiment remains cautious.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2025\n\nIn 2025, Digitalcoinprice expects ETH to see further growth, predicting prices between $6,343.49 and $7,643.08, with an average price of $7,511.09.\n\nCoincodex also sees potential growth, estimating that ETH could fluctuate between $2,887.55 and $6,579.89.\n\nDespite the variation, both sources agree on an upward trend.\n\nEthereum price prediction 2030\n\nLooking ahead to 2030, the predictions become even more optimistic.\n\nDigitalcoinprice forecasts Ethereum could reach between $19,899.44 and $21,831.38, with an average price of $20,751.58.\n\nCoincodex, while more conservative, still predicts a substantial increase, with prices ranging from $6,378.65 to $11,950.\n\nThese long-term forecasts reflect growing confidence in Ethereum\u2019s future and its potential to achieve a large value.\n\nWhen considering these ETH price predictions, it\u2019s essential to remember that these forecasts can and often go wrong. The crypto market is highly volatile, and many factors can influence prices. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to do your own research (DYOR) and never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "content": "Hong Kong could launch Ethereum staking ETFs within the next six months.\n\nOther crypto products, like a Uniswap ETF or Chainlink ETF, may follow.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched in April have been warmly received by Hong Kong\u2019s financial sector.\n\nEthereum staking exchange-traded funds are coming to Hong Kong \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Vivien Wong, partner at HashKey Capital, a crypto asset management firm that played a vital role in getting Hong Kong\u2019s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs off the ground.\n\n\u201cAs soon as spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in the US, people ran to us asking, \u2018are you planning to launch an Ether staking product?\u2019\u201d Wong told DL News.\n\nShe said regulators, like Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission, were talking with the industry.\n\n\u201cLast month, I sent a message to regulators to say there was a need for Ether staking,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWithout hesitating, they said \u2018okay, please send a detailed proposal.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe timing of her comments is notable.\n\nNine spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to launch in the US any day now, as soon as the Securities and Exchange Commission finalises applications.\n\nStaking Ethereum ETFs\n\nEthereum is designed so users can choose to lock in their Ether holdings and earn a 3% yield on the asset \u2014 a process called staking.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nWhile spot Ethereum ETFs enable investors to easily get exposure to Ether through their brokerage accounts, they don\u2019t allow them to gain that extra yield.\n\nIn fact, in Hong Kong, holders of these ETF shares must pay a management fee that\u2019s anywhere between 0.3% and 0.99%, depending on the fund they choose.\n\n\u201cFor a new Ethereum product to launch, it will probably require another six months or so,\u201d Wong said.\n\nWaiting for the mainland\n\nHong Kong is so keen to offer products that don\u2019t yet exist in the US, because the government wants the city to become a fintech powerhouse, according to Wong.\n\nAnd the process is running \u201cpretty smoothly,\u201d she said.\n\nAlready, the existing crypto ETFs are attracting two types of investors: People who simply want to \u201cbuy and hold,\u201d and crypto natives, Wong said. Crypto natives, in particular, have been enticed by the ETF design.\n\nThe funds\u2019 timely creation and redemption process allows investors to use them for over-the-counter trading purposes, according to Wong.\n\nBut by taking the lead and offering advanced products, the hope is for Hong Kong to draw in investors from other jurisdictions \u2014 and even, eventually, from the mainland.\n\nMainland investors cannot currently invest in these products. But hopefully, if the regulatory situation changes, \u201cthere will be more endorsements from investors in China and we will see more inflows,\u201d Wong said.\n\n\u201dWe are waiting for that to open up this market,\u201d she added.\n\nMassive success\n\nHong Kong\u2019s crypto ETFs have hauled in almost $260 million in assets since they launched in April, per The Block data.\n\nCompared to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US \u2014 which have brought in $14.6 billion since January 11 \u2014 that might feel small.\n\nBut considering that Hong Kong\u2019s ETF market is 168 times smaller than its US counterpart, the products have been a massive success. \u201cThere is definitely excitement,\u201d Wong said.\n\nWhether its financial institutions, wealth managers, distributors, or high net-worth individuals, the entire Hong Kong market is slowly digesting the products and becoming more comfortable with them, she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a guaranteed win.\n\nOpinion about crypto had soured in the region after some of the scandals from the last bear market \u2014 notably the fraud case surrounding Hong Kong crypto exchange JPEX.\n\nUniswap ETF?\n\nWong said that other cryptocurrencies will possibly have their own ETFs someday, but none of the choices are obvious, she said.\n\nFor Hong Kong regulators to approve new crypto ETFs, the underlying token must be publicly tradable through registered virtual asset trading platforms.\n\nAnd it must be very liquid, meaning that it must be easy for deep-pocketed market participants to trade.\n\nHaving a robust use case doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n\u201dERC-20 tokens would be generally preferred,\u201d Wong said, referring to tokens issued on the Ethereum network. \u201cSome names like Chainlink or Uniswap.\u201d\n\nAnd a Solana ETF might be in the cards as well.\n\n\u201cWe are talking with the SFC right now,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe are getting on with launching new products.\u201d\n\nUpdate: The piece was modified to clarify that investors from mainland China will only be able to invest in the ETFs when Chinese regulation allows it.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "content": "Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said he and his colleagues believe spot Ethereum ETFs could launch around July 15 as the application process settles.\n\nSeyffart posted the prediction on social media on July 3 but said he has \u201clow confidence in those launch date predictions at this point.\u201d\n\nThe prediction is related to Bitwise\u2019s amendment to its spot Ethereum ETF application on July 3. Seyffart noted that the only significant change was adding a six-month fee waiver for the first $500 million in assets. Seyffart said:\n\n\u201cThese changes were very minimal and [I don\u2019t know] why the ETFs wouldn\u2019t be ready to go within a couple weeks.\u201d\n\nHe added that there is no official timeline for approvals, and the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance is \u201ctaking [its] time\u201d approving each fund.\n\n\u201cLiterally nothing\u2019\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the latest round of comments involved \u201cliterally nothing\u201d and asserted the funds should have begun trading already.\n\nHe added that the light comments also allowed Bitwise to amend its application sooner than the July 8 deadline that it and other applicants are expected to meet.\n\nBalchunas said that all indications suggest a \u201claunch [is] still on for this month.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, ETF Store president Nate Geraci believes applicants will submit one more round of amendments to add fees before the funds can begin trading.\n\nSEC issued exchange approvals in May\n\nOn May 23, the SEC approved 19b-4 rule changes, allowing exchanges to list and trade the pending spot Ethereum ETFs. The agency must now approve S-1 registration statements to permit asset managers to issue the funds, but there is no deadline by which it must do so.\n\nBalchunas said the final approvals are guaranteed, noting:\n\n\u201cGood news is [the SEC] approved [the 19-b4s], this is just logistics and issuers at their mercy timeline wise.\u201d\n\nBalchunas previously predicted spot Ethereum ETFs would launch before July 4, calling the prediction an \u201cover/under\u201d date. He extended the earlier prediction in late June as the SEC asked applicants to amend their S-1 registration statements by July 8.\n\nOther applicants have backed a near-future launch for the Ethereum ETFs. Galaxy Digital, which has an application pending with Invesco, expects the funds to launch in a matter of weeks.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Investigation into the incident, which has not compromised any of the recipients, is still underway but Ethereum has already moved to block further phishing email delivery and avert potential compromise of other Web3 wallet providers through link submissions to blocklists. Aside from alerting users regarding the phishing scheme, Ethereum also disclosed performing selective email service migration and other measures to curb similar attacks in the future."

        "content": "Ethereum sees over $108 million in liquidations as Mt. Gox begins repayment to creditors.\n\nGrayscale Ethereum Trust switched to trading at a premium to net asset value as spot ETH ETF launch draws closer.\n\nEthereum may begin consolidation as key support may prove crucial in coming days.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down nearly 5% on Friday following the Mt. Gox BTC repayment, sparking more than $108 million in ETH liquidations. The repayment's supply strengthened the bearish momentum on Bitcoin, which spiraled into altcoins like ETH.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Mt. Gox headwind, ETHE discount\n\nThe defunct exchange Mt. Gox began the repayment of creditors today after transferring about $84.87 million worth of BTC to Japanese exchange Bitbank's hot wallets. The move increased the prevailing bearish sentiment in the crypto market as altcoins, led by Ethereum, suffered significant declines.\n\nWhile many expected ETH to be less affected by the wider market sentiment due to the upcoming spot ETH ETF launch, the Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) slow move to greenlight issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts likely gave bears the momentum.\n\nThe SEC approved the 19b-4 forms of spot ETH ETF issuers on May 23 but needs to greenlight their S-1s before the products can begin trading. The prospective issuers include VanEck, BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and Invesco.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) switched from trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV) to a premium of about 0.31% on July 3, according to data from YCharts.\n\nA trust trading at a discount or premium to net asset value means one share of the trust trades below or above the market price of the underlying asset it tracks.\n\nETHE Discount or Premium to NAV\n\nETHE has been trading at a discount because investors must sell their shares to exit their positions, as the trust doesn't allow them to redeem it for cash. The discount particularly increased between March and May after rumors of the SEC's Ethereum 2.0 investigation.\n\nHowever, the gap has closed and is now at a premium as investors bought the discounted shares heavily following the SEC's approval of prospective issuers' 19b-4 filings. The $9.5 billion ETHE trust will convert to an ETF when spot ETH ETFs go live.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum may begin consolidation\n\nEthereum is trading around $2,984 on Friday, down nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. The further decline from Thursday's lows sparked historic liquidations for ETH, wiping off $134 million of open positions from the market. Long liquidations climbed to $108.4 million, while shorts were shy of $26 million.\n\nETH's price has reached the lows of May, when most investors expected a spot ETH ETF denial following reports that the SEC was investigating Ethereum 2.0. ETH broke below the $2,852 key support level but quickly posted a weak exhaustion liquidity void, considering this represents a key demand zone for the top altcoin.\n\nETH/USDT 8-hour chart\n\nETH has failed to sustain an extended move below this support level since mid-February. Additionally, IntoTheBlock's data reveals investors purchased about 57.02 million ETH around the $2,268 to $2,909 price range.\n\nConsidering these factors, ETH may not sustain an extended decline below the $2,852 support as the weekend approaches. ETH will likely begin a horizontal trend around the $2,852 to $3,367 price range, where it traded for nearly five weeks (April 12 - May 19)."

        "content": "The chief investment officer (CIO) of Bitwise Asset Management, Matt Hougan, is predicting a massive bull cycle for Ethereum (ETH) based on several factors.\n\nIn a new interview with Scott Melker, Hougan says that spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) could draw $15 billion within 18 months of their approval, which is expected soon.\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s a down-the-middle prediction. We could be higher, we could be a little lower, but I think $15 billion is in the bag.\u201d\n\nHe also believes two additional bullish factors for ETH could send its value soaring: a greater acceptance of crypto by the US government and Ethereum\u2019s recent network upgrade, Dencun, which aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and data availability.\n\n\u201cI think that these numbers overlook the fact that we\u2019re entering what is usually the ETH cycle. They also overlook two huge tailwinds that I see for ETH, which is it had a lot of regulatory uncertainty, and over the last two months, a lot of that has gone away.\n\nNot only did we get movement forward on ETFs, but we also saw Washington generally change its tune on crypto. That\u2019s a massive tailwind for ETH. And then you have the aftereffects of the Dencun upgrade, which I don\u2019t think the market has fully recognized what that will mean for this market.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading for $2,974 at time of writing, down 3.6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has lost almost $800 million in the last three days. BTC is now below $60,000, representing a drop of 4.2%. Ethereum ETH is trading at $2,933, a loss of 6.56% over the last 24 hours. This drop is likely attributed to the massive German sell-off and Mt. Gox saga.\n\nAccording to a report, the German government has sold about $434.9 million worth of BTC since June 19. Unfortunately, this move brought negative sentiment in the market. Can ETH\u2019s price bounce back amid this declining market?\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Action\n\nETH\u2019s price tried multiple times to break above $3,900 but failed as strong bearish momentum pushed it lower. On July 4, ETH hit a strong support level at $2,800, representing a 28.2% drop from the $3,900 level.\n\nCurrently, ETH is recovering slowly, trading above $2,900. However, the overall market sentiment remains bearish. Analysts warn that this recovery might be short-lived, and the bearish trend could continue, pushing ETH lower again.\n\nBased on that, the $2,800 level will be crucial in determining ETH\u2019s next move. If this support breaks, we could see further drops. On the other hand, a strong bounce could signal a trend reversal.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signal Bearish Market\n\nETH\u2019s technical indicators are predominantly bearish. The 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) hover above the current market price. This positioning typically signals a strong downtrend, as the price is trading below the key long-term averages.\n\nAlso, the Price Volume Trend (PVT) indicator sits at 88K, suggesting decreasing buying pressure. This metric contributes to the downward price movement.\n\nFurthermore, ETH\u2019s price is trading below the Bollinger Bands, indicating that the downward trend is strong and may continue.\n\nAlso, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is below its signal line, while the histogram bars display red candles. This typically signals ongoing selling pressure and reinforces the bearish outlook.\n\nThe SuperTrend indicator is flashing a sell signal, suggesting that the current downtrend may persist in the near term.\n\nLastly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 27, indicating oversold conditions. While this might suggest a potential bounce, note that assets can remain oversold for extended periods.\n\nGiven this overwhelmingly bearish technical analysis, investors might consider waiting for clear reversal signals before entering long positions. Also, remember that markets can change rapidly at any time.\n\nPeter Schiff Predicts Ethereum Crash to $1,500\n\nEarlier today, renowned economist Peter Schiff predicted that Ethereum could crash to $1,500 based on market factors and technical analysis. Schiff sees Ethereum breaking crucial support regions, which usually signals a further decline in price as the buying strength is low.\n\n#Ethereum is also breaking key support. It\u2019s trading below $2,900, down 30% from its March high. I think a crash down to $1,500 is coming. It looks like those buying the #Ether ETF rumors couldn\u2019t wait for the fact to sell. pic.twitter.com/XXEyX67BXK \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 5, 2024\n\nMoreover, Schiff believes the anticipated Ethereum ETF launch is overhyped. Schiff claims the ETH ETF hype will ultimately fail soon. According to him, investors are selling off their positions since the price didn\u2019t go as expected.\n\nUnfortunately, Schiff\u2019s $1,500 prediction may create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors as they worry about the market\u2019s future. The crypto market is not doing well right now. Most cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, are losing value.\n\nEven if the U.S. SEC approves ETH ETFs, people might react differently to them because the market is already struggling. So, to be on the safe side, it is best to wait for the market to cool off before investing with proper risk management techniques in place.\n\nSecondly, while the broader crypto market is down, investors can consider a new memecoin on presale, which offers an opportunity to buy low and sell high.\n\nWienerAI: A Promising Alternative to Ethereum in a Bearish Market\n\nThe new project called WienerAI is gaining attention and has raised over $7 million in its presale. WienerAI combines humor with advanced technology. It offers an AI-powered trading bot on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThis bot helps users make better trading decisions and protects them from front-running bots. The project has an interesting story involving a mix of AI and a dog.\n\nAdditionally, WienerAI focuses on building a strong community called \u201cThe Sausage Army.\u201d WienerAI offers high staking rewards, and holders of WAI tokens can earn substantial returns.\n\nFurthermore, the project has solid tokenomics with a clear allocation plan. Crypto influencers are already talking about WienerAI\u2019s potential, highlighting its innovative features and engaging branding.\n\nAs a result, more investors are showing interest in the project.\n\nWienerAI\u2019s Advantages in the Current Market\n\nWhile Ethereum struggles, WienerAI\u2019s presale is thriving. It has already raised over $7 million. This shows strong investor confidence in the project.\n\nThe team behind WienerAI has a clear roadmap. They plan to list the token on major exchanges soon, which could increase its visibility and value.\n\nWienerAI\u2019s AI-powered trading tool sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies. It promises to enhance trading efficiency and accuracy. This feature could attract traders looking for an edge in the market.\n\nAnother advantage is the project\u2019s community-centric approach. It fosters engagement and loyalty among its users, which could lead to long-term support and growth.\n\nAnalysts believe WienerAI has the potential for a 100X return on investment, making it an attractive option for investors seeking high rewards.\n\nIf you want to join a new crypto project while it is still affordable, rush to the presale page now and grab as many coins as possible.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

The prediction of a drop to $1,500 would represent a significant decline and may influence market sentiment further.\n\nCrypto market losses deepen\n\nSchiff's comments come at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is experiencing volatility. According to CoinGlass data, more than $800 million in bullish crypto bets were liquidated in the last three days, one of the heaviest such liquidations since April.\n\nBitcoin fell for the fourth straight trading session, part of a larger crypto sell-off that contrasted with recent record highs in global stock markets. Ethereum experienced higher losses, reaching 10%.\n\nApprovals for the U.S. ETFs of Ethereum are forthcoming, but interest in the products may be mixed if the crypto sell-off continues.\n\nInvestors are awaiting U.S. jobs statistics later Friday to get the latest hint at the Fed's policy stance. Recent soft economic indicators have boosted the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy in the coming months.\n\nLikewise, the market will be closely monitoring Ethereum's performance and the potential impact of ETF developments in the coming weeks."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Forecast: Will ETH Crash Hit $2,500 Before Spot ETF Trading? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Forecast: The intense selling pressure impacting most cryptocurrencies has been caused by various factors including the German Government\u2019s Bitcoin selling spree and a colossal transfer of BTC to exchanges by Mt. Gox, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nInvestors appear worried as a major correction paints price charts in the cryptocurrency market red in July. Collectively, the market has in the last few months tumbled to $2 trillion from $2.8 trillion\u2014a milestone achieved in March.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLike most cryptos, Ethereum could not withstand the increasing pressure on the sell side. The second-largest digital asset extended the correction below the critical $3,000 level.\n\nEther is down 7% to $2,940 on Friday in addition to 16.5% in the last seven days, CoinGecko data shows. Nonetheless, the trading volume has surged by almost 60% to $30 billion, underlining a dramatic increase in selling activity.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast: Is the Dip a Buying Opportunity or Trap?\n\nDespite the upcoming approval of Ethereum ETFs, bearish sentiment continues to swell. Investors thought the up rally to $3,975 in June marketed the beginning of a long-term bull run but it has in the last few weeks proved to be a trap.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing individual Ether ETF applications ahead of the live trading. However, headwinds in the market are leaving no stone unturned while turning crypto portfolios upside down.\n\nWhile the actual trading of Ethereum ETFs would be a game changer, especially for altcoins eyeing a similar milestone, the ongoing dip has many worried about how far it can go.\n\nBased on the Ethereum price prediction, the token of the smart contracts now holds below all three key Exponential Moving Average (EMAs) including the 20-day, the 50-day, and the 100-day.\n\nChances are that the downtrend will continue into the weekend, considering the Relative Strength Index (RSI) persistent drop.\n\nShould sellers intensify their activities, Ethereum might breach a previously tested support at $2,800, highlighted in black on the chart. Such a move could further destabilize ETH price thus accentuating the sell-off to $2,500.\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) an indicator that tracks the flow of money in and out of Ethereum markets, shows signs of bottoming out above the oversold region.\n\nIf selling pressure equalizes buying pressure, ETH will start to move sideways, giving recovery a chance in the coming days.\n\nA potential double-bottom pattern from support at $2,800 could also influence the trend reversal. The last time Ethereum price tested this support area, a major upswing erupted to $3,975.\n\nIn the short term, traders can watch out for the reclamation of support at $3,000 where, ETH could consolidate awaiting the next catalyst, possibly the spot ETF approval to ignite a major rebound past $4,000.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is the Ethereum blockchain the same as Bitcoin? Although they are both cryptocurrencies, ETH and BTC do not share the same blockchain technology. Ethereum is a proof-of-stake protocol while BTC is a proof-of-work network. 2. Can Ethereum topple Bitcoin to become the biggest crypto? Possibly, but considering Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the market, this achievement would take a long time. 3. When will Ethereum ETFs start trading? ETH ETFs could start trading 3 days after the final S-1 filings. This is projected to be around mid-July.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto trader is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) relative to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 217,800 followers on the social media platform X that the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair is \u201cstill holding up pretty strong.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sherpa, the ETH/BTC pair is currently in a \u201cfine spot\u201d for long opportunities amid the potential approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\u201cETH to all-time highs is near guaranteed before the end of the year.\u201d\n\nEthereum, which is trading at 0.05457 BTC ($3,142) at time of writing, would need to rally by around 187% to reach the all-time high of 0.15636 BTC recorded in November of 2021.\n\nMoving on to the crypto king, Sherpa says,\n\n\u201cPrice still in an overall high time-frame range between $73,000 \u2013 $56,000 but things of course look bearish in the short term.\u201d\n\nSherpa concludes his analyst by says that a bullish phase could kick off around three months from now for altcoins.\n\n\u201cAltcoins are continuing to sell off, I still don\u2019t see any end in sight for that. I never understood why people thought we\u2019d get some sort of alt season in the summer.\n\nI could maybe see it for ETH ETF bidding but you generally need a healthy BTC for this to happen. Still possible I guess but I\u2019m still a bit pessimistic. I think it\u2019s likely we continue to chop and chill for the next few months and then have a very nice Q4.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "From discount to premium: a significant change for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), one of the largest investment vehicles for ethereum, has seen a significant evolution in its price compared to the net asset value (NAV).\n\nHistorically, the Trust has traded at a discount to NAV, but recently, in anticipation of the expected launch of a spot ETF, this discount has turned into a premium.\n\nFrom discount to premium: a significant change for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust\n\nThe transition from discount to premium is a significant event for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. Until recently, ETHE was trading at a price lower than the value of its holdings in ethereum.\n\nThis phenomenon was due to a series of factors, including the structure of the trust, the dynamics of supply and demand, and market expectations regarding regulation and competition.\n\nAccording to YCharts data, on July 3, 2024, the premium over NAV reached 0.31%. This means that investors are willing to pay slightly more than the actual value of the assets held by the Trust.\n\nThis change has been gradual and silent, but it represents an important signal of the evolution of investor sentiment.\n\nVarious factors have contributed to the transition of ETHE from a discount to a premium. One of the most important is the anticipation of the launch of a spot ETF on ethereum.\n\nA spot ETF would be a financial product that directly tracks the price of ethereum, providing a simpler and more direct way for investors to access this cryptocurrency through traditional markets.\n\nThe introduction of a spot ETF could increase the demand for ethereum and for related products like ETHE. Investors might see the Trust as an early and safe gateway to the ETF, expecting the price of ETHE to benefit from the increase in demand.\n\nThe impact of the regulator\n\nAnother key factor is the change in the perception of regulatory risk. Historically, crypto products like ETHE have been subject to significant regulatory uncertainties. However, there have been positive signs of a more favorable attitude from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) towards crypto ETFs.\n\nThe recent statements and actions of the SEC suggest that the approval of a spot ETF on ethereum could be more likely than it was in the past.\n\nThis has helped to reduce the perceived risk associated with ETHE, making it a more attractive investment and contributing to the shift from discount to premium.\n\nFor investors, the transition of ETHE to a premium compared to NAV has several implications. On one hand, it indicates greater confidence in the product and its future prospects. On the other hand, investors need to be aware that they are paying a price higher than the actual value of the underlying assets, which entails an additional risk if the premium were to decrease or return to a discount.\n\nInvestors must also consider the impact of the potential launch of a spot ETF on ethereum. If the ETF were approved, it could provide a more direct and potentially less expensive alternative to ETHE, which could influence the price of the Trust.\n\nThe future of ETHE and ethereum ETFs\n\nThe future of ETHE and ethereum ETFs is closely tied to regulatory decisions and the evolution of the crypto market. If the spot ETF is approved, it could mark a significant change in the way institutional and retail investors access ethereum.\n\nAccording to Grayscale, the challenge will be to maintain the relevance of ETHE in a market that could see the entry of new competing products. However, the company has demonstrated an ability to adapt and innovate that could help it navigate this new landscape.\n\nThe transition of Grayscale Ethereum Trust from a discount to a premium relative to NAV is a significant event that reflects changes in market dynamics and regulatory expectations.\n\nWith the anticipation of the launch of a spot ETF on ethereum, investors are showing greater confidence in ETHE, leading its price to exceed the net asset value.\n\nHowever, this change brings with it new risk considerations and opportunities, which investors must evaluate carefully. As always, the evolution of the crypto market will be influenced by a combination of regulatory, market, and technological factors, and the future of ETHE will be a crucial development to follow."

        "content": "Shiba Inu could spike to a new all-time high of $0.0002545 if it follows Ethereum\u2019s trajectory should the leading altcoin reach $50,000.\n\nThe crypto market is now on a recovery path, as most assets look to recoup the losses incurred this week. Shiba Inu is among the best performers in the recovery campaign, currently up 15.22% over the past 24 hours. SHIB has now reclaimed the psychological thresholds at $0.000014 and $0.000015.\n\nShiba Inu currently boasts a position among the 10 biggest 24-hour gainers on the top 100 list of largest cryptocurrencies. For context, Bitcoin (BTC) is only up 4% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum (ETH) has increased 4.06%.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nShiba Inu Price if Ethereum Hits $50,000\n\nWith the prospects surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum currently bullish, market watchers expect a similar effect on Shiba Inu. Notably, when leading assets like BTC and ETH record upsurges, Shiba Inu and other altcoins follow suit. This is due to their close price correlation.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s Correlation Matrix confirms that Shiba Inu boasts a price correlation of 87% with Ethereum over the last month. In addition, SHIB has a correlation of 94% with Bitcoin within this period. This indicates that a rapid price surge from ETH or BTC could trigger a similar rise in Shiba Inu\u2019s price.\n\nConsequently, we recently assessed how much Shiba Inu would be worth if it trails Ethereum upon the completion of one its numerous targets. One such target saw asset manager VanEck predict last May that Ethereum could hit $50,000 by 2030.\n\nIf Ethereum clinches this $50,000 price, it could have far-reaching effects on Shiba Inu. For context, ETH currently trades for $2,989. The altcoin would need to rally 1,572% to hit the $50,000 target. If Shiba Inu sees a similar upsurge, its price would jump from the current $0.00001522 to $0.0002545. This would lead to a new ATH.\n\nSHIB at the $0.0002 Level\n\nNotably, despite its recent encouraging recovery performance, Shiba Inu is still down 66% from its yearly peak of $0.000045. In addition, SHIB has dropped nearly 83% from the all-time high of $0.00008845 attained in 2021.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMarket participants and analysts believe SHIB still has more room for growth. While some project a reclamation of $0.000045, others expect a rally to $0.000165, beyond the current all-time high. Several market commentators also predict a surge to an ambitious $0.00045 price.\n\nPredictions to the $0.0002 level have also come up. Last month, crypto trader Valeriya projected a rise to $0.000022. Also, Bitcoin advocate Moataz Elsayad believes SHIB can hit $0.00024. These projections have varying bases, with some citing a broader market uptrend as a possible catalyst. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen if any could materialize."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFranklin Templeton, a veteran wealth manager with over $1.65 trillion in AUM, shares its bullish take on Ethereum (ETH) as a tech development and economic instrument. Despite savage competition, Ethereum (ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized economy and constantly unlocks new opportunities for the community.\n\n\"Forefront of Web3 innovation\": Franklin Templeton praises Ethereum\n\nGlobal asset management heavyweight Franklin Templeton released its \"Understanding the Value of The Ethereum Network\" report covering the tech impact of the second cryptocurrency. It displays the most important features of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, its challenges and opportunities.\n\nImage by Franklin Templeton\n\nThe analysts of the investment giant stressed that Ethereum advanced Bitcoin\u2019s accomplishments to create a robust and accessible tech basis for distributed ledger applications, enabling a comprehensive decentralized economy.\n\nAs the next step, the onset of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its Solidity smart contracts has changed the narrative in app development, making Ethereum the foundation for a wide range of decentralized applications across various segments in B2B and B2C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report particularly highlights the scaling role of Layer 2 networks in pushing the barriers of Ethereum (ETH) performance metrics and decentralization status:\n\nCollectively, L1 blockchains (Ethereum and others) and L2 blockchains provide the foundations for \u201cWeb3,\u201d the new iteration of the World Wide Web (WWW) that enables users\u2019 WWW ownership. The Web3 business models that have emerged are paving the way for a new type of network economy and approach to commercial transactions, creating a protocol-based economy that encourages democratized ownership and rewards participation\n\nAs a result, Ethereum (ETH) managed to establish a vibrant, diversified protocol economy with a diverse array of novel use cases in DeFi, GameFi, NFT, metaverse and other trending segments.\n\nEthereum ETFs: Final call?\n\nAuthors concluded that Ethereum (ETH) stands out as unique combination of a native peer-to-peer payment network, a common developer toolkit and a virtual machine for executing smart contracts that has set a new standard for blockchain technology.\n\nIt should be added that Franklin Templeton is a participant of the Ethereum spot ETF race in the U.S. It filed with the SEC for an ETF approval in February 2024.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, major analysts and community participants are sure that Ethereum spot ETFs will be green-lit as soon as this month.\n\nThe final approval of S-1 forms is expected to happen by July 12, said The ETF Store president Nate Geraci. Potentially, this hints at ETF trading launch following on July 15."

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), the second cryptocurrency to have an ETF approved in the US.\n\nLaunched in 2015 with the vision of being a \u201cworld computer\u201d, Ethereum has gained interest from tech enthusiasts and investors alike, growing to a market cap of $350bn.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a type of investment that tracks a particular index, sector, or commodity that can be traded on a stock exchange like a regular stock. ETFs make it easier to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. By investing through an ETF, investors avoid the complexities of holding crypto; like securing private keys or dealing with disreputable cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThe approval of a second cryptocurrency ETF in the US signals greater acceptance of the asset class and increasing regulatory clarity. Greater access combined with increasing regulatory clarity is likely to drive an increased demand for Ethereum.\n\nThe chart above shows the subsequent price rise of gold following the listing of the first gold ETF in March 2003. When gold ETFs were introduced, they provided an accessible and cost-effective way to invest in gold compared to buying physical gold.\n\nWhy were Ethereum ETFs approved?\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs by the US SEC on May 23 2024, was unexpected, with many market analysts anticipating a rejection.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

However, the precedent set by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January was likely a key deciding factor in the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nOff to a bad start: Listings of the Ethereum ETFs are delayed\n\nDespite the approval, the listing of Ethereum ETFs has faced delays. This delay is unusual, as ETFs typically start trading immediately after approval, as was the case for the Bitcoin ETFs launched in January. Pending SEC approval of S-1 forms, trading is expected to begin mid-to-late July, although an exact timeline is uncertain.\n\nThese delays have tempered investor excitement and highlighted the ongoing challenges with crypto regulation. When trading does begin, the Ethereum ETFs will be welcomed into a cryptocurrency market experiencing a summer lull. Both Ethereum and the wider cryptocurrency market are down 30% since their highs in the first quarter.\n\nWhat we can expect when Ethereum ETFs are listed\n\nThe approval of Ethereum ETFs follows the successful introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in January, which exceeded expectations. On the first day of trading, the ETFs saw $4.6bn in trading volume and have since amassed a combined $76bn of assets under management.\n\nHowever, the success of the Ethereum ETFs is not a foregone conclusion. The mood of the cryptocurrency market is very different now from what it was in January, and while Bitcoin and Ethereum share similarities, they are also very different assets. With a fixed limited supply, Bitcoin is viewed as digital gold, whereas Ethereum, with a more technically ambitious goal of \u201cworld computer\u201d, is often likened to digital oil.\n\nMore Crypto ETFs to come\n\nThe approval of the Ethereum ETF marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems.\n\nWhile delays and regulatory challenges persist, the Ethereum ETFs are likely not the last cryptocurrency ETFs the SEC will approve. Indeed 21Shares, issuer of the fourth largest Bitcoin ETF, has already filed an application with the SEC for a Solana ETF."

        "content": "What are the long-term goals of Ethereum France, and how do you see the organisation evolving over the next five years given how quickly narratives and themes change in crypto?\n\nJdT: The long-term goal of Ethereum France has always been to educate the public about blockchain technologies, particularly Ethereum. Over the next five years, we aim to expand our presence in French-speaking regions, reaching as many people as possible to help them understand the transformative potential of this technology.\n\nCrypto themes and narratives change quickly, and we aim to be adaptable and responsive to the industry\u2019s evolution. We\u2019re also seeking to maintain momentum and motivation within our nonprofit organisation, so we have been recruiting for the past two years to bolster operations and ensure sustainable long-term growth.\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most promising use cases for Ethereum in the next decade? How is Ethereum France positioning itself to capitalise on these emerging opportunities?\n\nJdt: The scaling roadmap of Ethereum has already delivered cheap blockspace for new applications. In my opinion, the main waves of blockchain adoption are going to be gaming and social networks. These themes first emerged at EthCC, and we closely monitor their progress to inform the design of our conference tracks.\n\nA core focus at Ethereum France is to encourage the development of these emerging use cases, and to nurture the growth in interest and talent entering the blockchain space. We host monthly meetups where builders can showcase their latest developments and make information accessible to onboard newcomers into the space.\n\nEthCC has grown significantly since its inception. What are some of the key milestones and successes of EthCC over the years, and how has the conference evolved to meet the changing needs of the Ethereum community?\n\nBBF: EthCC has grown organically since its inception, evolving alongside Ethereum. Starting as a small gathering of enthusiasts, it now covers a broad range of themes and attracts a diverse range of industry professionals. We\u2019re proud of the influential speakers and key announcements made on our stage, reflecting the conference\u2019s importance in the industry.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNow in its seventh edition, EthCC expects more than 6000 attendees and 360 speakers, including at the EthVC programme, which serves as a crucial connection between startups and investors. While we\u2019ve grown a lot in recent years, we maintain an open and welcoming atmosphere. We understand that the event is not just for engineers and developers anymore. Catering to all professionals, we have expanded our services to include networking zones and silent workspaces. We\u2019ve also added childcare services this year, acknowledging the growing number of parents in our community who want to fully participate in the conference.\n\nThe agenda of EthCC covers a wide range of topics within the Ethereum ecosystem. How do you curate the content and select speakers to ensure that the conference addresses the most pressing and innovative topics in the Ethereum space?\n\nBBF: Curating content and selecting speakers for EthCC is indeed a challenging task that keeps us on our toes. There\u2019s no magic formula; we spend the year closely monitoring industry trends to best understand what\u2019s happening in the Ethereum space. Given the fast-paced nature of Ethereum, making these decisions eight months in advance is challenging, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to predict everything flawlessly.\n\nWe encourage everyone to apply to EthCC, and each year we discover small projects and lesser-known researchers with valuable insights. We always try to balance well-known speakers and fresh voices. Importantly, we have a strict policy against accepting payments for speaking slots. While this complicates things\u2014especially when companies try to pressure us\u2014it ensures we maintain high-quality speakers. Our reviewers do an extraordinary job, thoroughly reading every application and making selections based on merit. They avoid choosing speakers solely based on fame or rejecting them due to obscurity, ensuring a comprehensive agenda across different tracks."

        "content": "Ethereum prices are facing heightened volatility amid market turmoil. The oldest whale moved millions to Coinbase, raising fears of a massive sell-off. This movement has stirred the crypto market, especially after Bitcoin\u2019s sharp decline below $53,500 in early trading.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was trading at approximately $2,951.71, after reaching a daily low of $2,834, according to CoinStats.\n\nETH/USD 24 Hour Price Chart (Source: CoinStats)\n\nSignificant Bitcoin transfers from the Mt. Gox cold wallet and the German government\u2019s address have intensified panic. Traders are on edge, expecting selling pressure from wallets holding vast amounts of BTC and in turn on the overall crypto market.\n\nMarket Indicators Signal Potential Decline\n\nDespite the declines, Ethereum remains above a key support zone, viewed as the last line of defense before a significant drop. Future markets indicate ETH\u2019s price within a bullish range, with Open Interest (OI), monitoring total open positions in contracts, showing a major flush has yet to occur.\n\nRecent pullbacks brought ETH close to $2800, yet OI data suggests potential for further decline. The bearish outlook may intensify, risking a break below $2500, which could trigger mass liquidation as derivative contracts close.\n\nYou would think that but then you take a look at $ETH OI in coin terms and you realize that's not actually the case.\n\n\n\nWhen we look at OI in coin terms (below) we can see that the big flush on positioning hasn't actually happened yet- OI has just dropped in $ terms because price\u2026 https://t.co/EiWwbThRBn pic.twitter.com/bZ1vDflFmq \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 5, 2024\n\nThe exit of open interest from the Ethereum ETF approval, valued at $3.5 billion, adds to the potential downside risk if prices exceed $2800.\n\nStruggling to Maintain Support Levels\n\nCurrently, Ethereum battles to reclaim the crucial support zone around $3000 with a daily price dip of 5.28% at press time. A daily close within or above this range might stabilize prices and prompt recovery. However, ongoing market fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) could drive Bitcoin to $52,000, dragging Ethereum below $2700 over the weekend.\n\nTraders closely watch these levels, as a failure to hold support could lead to further significant losses.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market position is precarious, with crucial support levels under threat. The coming days are critical, as market dynamics could either stabilize or further disrupt ETH prices."

Will the decline go further this weekend?\n\nWith a bullish close last Sunday and a 1.75% rise, the investors did not anticipate a crash this week. However, the release of the Mr. Gox Bitcoin payout has caused the crypto market to plummet to critical levels.\n\nThe massive payouts from the 2014 Mt. Gox security breach have increased supply pressure across the broader market. As a result, the crypto market experienced massive declines.\n\nAs buyers struggle to absorb the selling pressure, Ethereum (ETH), has fallen below the $3,000 mark. With this, Ethereum\u2019s price struggled to find support amidst the market crash. Despite HODLers\u2019 hopes for a quick recovery, ETH has fallen below the critical level. With a 16.42% drop this week, bearish patterns and signals still show on the Ethereum price chart.\n\nThe overpowering bears have initiated a decline with an evening star formation, aiming to restest the $3,460 range breakdown.\n\nOver the past four days, including a 6% intraday drop, ETH has broken below a long-standing support trendline, falling 16% in total. This decline has also affected major altcoins and meme coins like Solana, DOGE, and SHIB, which have each seen a drop of 15% or more this week.\n\nWith the increasing moment, the trendline breakout has pushed Ethereum (ETH) to its next support level at $2,875. Additionally, this decline has triggered a bearish phase in the MACD and signal lines, now below the zero lines.\n\nMeanwhile, a whale recently caused a massive stir in the crypto market by dumping 26,600 ETH valued at $82.5 million to repay debt on Aave, resulting in a 3.4% drop in Ethereum\u2019s price. Following this, the whale created a new walley and borrowed 80.9 million USDT from Aavve to purchase 26,235 ETH priced at $3,084.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2879, reflecting a 9.70% decrease in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "Fri 05 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nA shockwave has shaken the world of crypto. In a matter of hours, Bitcoin plummeted by 8%, Ethereum tumbled by over 10%, and millions of dollars in long positions were liquidated. As traders try to understand the reasons behind this sudden downfall, concerns are growing over the significant movements of funds related to Mt. Gox, the defunct exchange platform.\n\nA Steep Dive for Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe crypto market was hit by a wave of $580 million in liquidations, a direct consequence of an 8% drop in Bitcoin and similar declines for Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. Long transactions on BTC and Eth saw losses exceeding $380 million, with the largest single liquidation observed on Binance, where an Ethereum transaction worth $18.4 million was forcibly closed.\n\nThese massive liquidations result from highly leveraged positions that traders could not maintain in the face of sudden price drops. Data from Coinalyze shows that this situation led to one of the largest waves of liquidations of the year. Moreover, open interest, which measures the number of unsettled bets on futures contracts, fell by 12%, signaling a capital outflow from the market. This increased volatility reflects a sense of panic among investors, exacerbated by external factors such as the movements of funds related to Mt. Gox and government decisions influencing the market.\n\nMarket dynamics, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors all play critical roles in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Staying informed and agile is key for those involved in the market. Nickolas Hoog, VP of Marketing at BitMart\n\nThe Role of Mt. Gox and Other Trigger Factors\n\nIn anticipation of repayments to creditors, Mt. Gox transferred more than $2.7 billion in bitcoins to a new address. This move has sparked fears of increased selling pressure, amplifying the price drops.\n\nAt the same time, the German government\u2019s decision to liquidate a portion of its bitcoin holdings added a layer of uncertainty to the markets. Traders, already nervous about macroeconomic uncertainties and the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, reacted by massively selling their positions. This massive liquidation caused significant losses for overleveraged positions, particularly on platforms like Binance, where an Ethereum/USDT transaction of nearly $19 million was liquidated.\n\nThis increased volatility and price drops have generated a sense of fear among investors, with the fear and greed index plunging to alarming levels. The outlook for the market remains uncertain in the short term, with analysts anticipating a challenging third quarter, marked by increased investor caution and persistent volatility.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "In defiance of the market\u2019s downturn, a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain, Billy BILLY/USD, has experienced a significant surge, with its value increasing by nearly 147% in the last week.\n\nWhat Happened: The value of Billy, a memecoin with a dog theme, has surged by nearly 147% in the last week, reaching $0.182. This surge in value comes after several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bittrue, Bitget, MEXC, and Gate.io, added support for the coin, reported The Daily Hodl.\n\nBilly, which was launched in June, features a puppy image and has outperformed other popular meme coins during the current market consolidation phase, which has led to significant declines across the board, the report noted.\n\nDespite the market\u2019s downturn, Billy\u2019s market cap is currently at $181.8 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $55.3 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhy It Matters: Despite their often whimsical nature, meme coins have been gaining traction and demonstrating significant market resilience.\n\nOther dog-theme assets such as Shiba Inu SHIB/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD are trading at $0.00001538 and $0.1081 respectively as of the time of writing this article.\n\nOther top-tier cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD have come under selling pressure over the past week \u2013 while Bitcoin has fallen over 7%, Ethereum declined by over 11%.\n\nRead More:\n\nPhoto courtesy: @billydogsolana\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Anan Ashraf."

        "content": "ETH plunged harder than BTC despite \u2018expected\u2019 ETF catalyst by mid-July\n\nMixed views by analysts on how the market will receive the ETH ETF amidst negative sentiment.\n\nEthereum [ETH] wasn\u2019t spared in the ongoing market rout despite a potential ETF launch by mid-July.\n\nThe second-largest digital asset shed over $500 since the 1st of July, dropping from $3.4K to a low of $2.8K, erasing all gains netted after partial ETF approval in May.\n\nHowever, Ethereum educator Sassal claimed that there was \u2018no bearish\u2019 factor apart from possible outflows from Grayscale\u2019s ETH trust, ETHE.\n\n\u201cThis entire run has now been retraced since the ETFs got approved on May 23rd\u2026The main overhang for ETH right now, in my opinion, is the possible Grayscale ETHE outflows.\u201d\n\nHe added that there were \u201cfundamental reasons to be bearish going forward\u201d and cited possible tailwinds from increasing regulatory clarity and likely Fed rate cuts in later 2024.\n\nETH dropped harder than BTC\n\nDespite Sassal\u2019s optimistic view, the recent dump hammered ETH more than BTC. On the weekly front, as of press time, BTC was down about 11%, while ETH declined 14%.\n\nThe unproportionate decline was unprecedented and baffled some traders, given the expected ETH ETF launch in two weeks.\n\nSome market observers claimed that ETH\u2019s hard dump was due to a lack of a strong narrative. Another user, Evans, suggested that the market was risk-off and that potential ETHE outflows could dent the ETH ETF\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u201cEveryone fears grayscale unlock (more impactful in low-volume summer). The market is risk-off, and everyone expects little to no demand for ETH out of the gate.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, ETH pullback hit the golden zone at 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, based on the 2024 lows and highs.\n\nThe 61.8% Fib level ($2.8k) doubled as a daily order block (marked cyan) and has been a crucial support in the first half of 2024. Whether the support hold could depend on Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] next move.\n\nHowever, investors\u2019 risk-off approach was further reiterated by negative outflows in the derivatives market.\n\nSince the 1st of July, ETH has seen net outflows totaling $4.5 billion, per Coinglass data, underscoring the bearish sentiment and possible lukewarm reception to the ETF launch.\n\nHowever, a recent Bloomberg report noted that crypto market sentiment could only improve if the Fed turns dovish and offers \u201cone or two interest cuts.\u201d"

        "content": "While ETH\u2019s price dropped, whales deposited tokens worth millions of dollars\n\nFew metrics and indicators suggested that ETH was undervalued\n\nAs the crypto market witnessed a crash last week, the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], also fell victim to a massive price correction. Because of the price decline, many might have lost confidence in the token. However, the trend changed over the last few hours as ETH\u2019s daily chart soon turned green.\n\nEthereum\u2019s high volatility\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s price had dropped by more than 12% in just seven days. AMBCrypto\u2019s assessment of IntoTheBlock\u2019s data also revealed that ETH\u2019s average balance dropped, which can be attributed to the token\u2019s double-digit price decline.\n\nIn the meantime, Lookonchain posted a tweet sharing an interesting development. According to the same, several whales started to sell ETH as its value fell. To be precise, three Ethereum whales deposited 28,558 ETH, worth over $82.2 million, to Binance. Soon after though, ETH\u2019s price registered a trend reversal on the charts.\n\nIn fact, the altcoin\u2019s price has appreciated by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours alone. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $2,967.81 with a market capitalization of over $356 billion.\n\nHowever, despite the rise in price, its trading volume dropped by double digits. This suggested that ETH might not sustain its bullish momentum for long.\n\nWill ETH\u2019s bull rally last?\n\nLike the trading volume, a few other metrics also looked pretty bearish.\n\nFor instance, though ETH recorded a price hike, selling pressure on the token continued to remain high. This was evidenced by looking at CryptoQuant\u2019s data, with the same highlighting a rise in ETH\u2019s exchange reserves. Simply put, several investors chose to sell.\n\nNonetheless, other metrics supported the possibility of a sustained uptrend as well.\n\nFor example \u2013 ETH\u2019s funding rate has been rising, meaning that long-position traders have been dominant and may be willing to pay short-position traders. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI), as per CryptoQuant, was in the oversold zone too. This might help increase buying pressure in the coming days, which might in turn result in a price hike on the charts.\n\nOn top of that, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Glassnode\u2019s data revealed that EThereum\u2019s NVT ratio dropped sharply. A fall in this metric means that an asset is undervalued, which is generally followed by price hikes.\n\nWe then planned to have a look at ETH\u2019s daily chart to better understand what to expect. We found that ETH\u2019s price touched the lower limit of the Bollinger Bands \u2013 Underlining the chances of a rebound.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAdditionally, its Money Flow Index (MFI) was also about to enter the oversold zone.\n\nHowever, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) looked bearish, as at press time it had a value of -0.09."

        "content": "Bitwise CIO predicts $15 billion inflow into Ethereum ETFs within 18 months.\n\nEthereum ETFs expected to attract significant institutional investment, bolstering ETH\u2019s market position.\n\nAnticipation for the launch of Ethereum [ETH] ETFs has reached a fever pitch, with many experts speculating about potential launch dates. Industry analysts are increasingly confident that ETFs could debut as soon as mid-July.\n\nRecent developments suggest that multiple applicants will submit their amended S-1 forms by 8th July, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, indicated that final approvals could be expected by 12th July, potentially setting the stage for a launch during the week of 15th July.\n\nEthereum ETFs to see $15 billion inflows?\n\nBitwise\u2019s CIO, Matt Hougan, has expressed confidence in Ethereum\u2019s appeal to institutional investors, a sentiment not universally shared until now.\n\nIn a video with analyst Scott Melker, the CIO reveals that the observations from European and Canadian markets, where Ethereum consistently attracts substantial investment, reinforce his optimistic outlook for similar success in the U.S. market.\n\nHougan\u2019s analysis extends beyond mere speculation, delving into strategic conversations with leaders from major financial institutions.\n\nOne such dialogue with a $100+ billion advisory firm revealed a readiness to diversify into Ethereum upon the launch of an official ETF, highlighting the broader financial community\u2019s growing comfort with cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class.\n\nFurthermore, Hougan challenges the prevailing narrative of high correlation between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets.\n\nHe argues that, aside from brief periods of alignment due to extraordinary economic measures like those recently seen, cryptocurrencies generally operate independently of traditional markets.\n\nThis independence is crucial for investors seeking diversification and risk-adjusted returns.\n\nEthereum\u2019s struggle: Market downturn and surging liquidations\n\nAmid the broader market downturn, Ethereum\u2019s performance mirrors the decline seen in Bitcoin, with ETH dropping approximately 6.2% in the last 24 hours to a current trading price of $3,139.\n\nThis significant decrease has led to considerable losses for many traders.\n\nData from Coinglass reveals that over the past 24 hours, 113,506 traders have been liquidated, contributing to total liquidations of $317.34 million.\n\nOf this, Ethereum-related liquidations account for about $76.51 million, predominantly in long positions, amounting to $70.16 million compared to $6.35 million in shorts.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation, market intelligence platform Santiment has reported a downturn in Ethereum\u2019s open interest.\n\nAdditionally, data from CryptoQuant highlights that Ethereum\u2019s Estimated Leverage Ratio across all exchanges has risen to a notable 0.392. This indicates an increase in leveraged positions relative to the asset\u2019s market cap which could suggest heightened risk of volatility or further liquidations.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nDespite these challenges, not all indicators for Ethereum are bearish.\n\nAMBCrypto has reported a recent uptick in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized application (dApp) volume, suggesting some areas of the Ethereum ecosystem continue to see robust activity."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market has reached \"pre-ETF rumor\" price levels, practically losing all their gains since May. Things are not looking good, and the only relatively positive thing we can see is the descending trading volume amid the price correction.\n\nEthereum's price rose initially as a result of the much-anticipated ETF news. It appears, though, that traders lack the conviction to keep the rally going despite the ETF announcement alone. Ethereum's current price of $3,205 is significantly below its recent highs, indicating that there was insufficient purchasing interest.\n\nThe absence of notable advancements in Ethereum's ecosystem this year is a major contributing factor to the lack of buying support on the market. There have not been any significant additions or innovations to the network that would increase its demand or utility.\n\nThis means that neither new investors nor existing ones are drawn to the Ethereum network and, as a result, usage and demand for it remain low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn uncertain future lies ahead for Ethereum according to the technical analysis, too. There is a bearish trend in the price as it has dropped below the 50 EMA and the 100 EMA critical support levels. The 200 EMA at $3,090 is the next important support level, and if the current trend holds, it may be tested soon.\n\nShiba Inu's disrupted plans\n\nBitcoin plummeting below $60,000 has clearly disrupted a lot of plans on the market. Not many expected the digital gold to drop down so badly in the last 24 hours, which greatly affected the performance of assets like Shiba Inu, which lost a substantial portion of their values.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is down a lot from its recent highs, trading at about $0.00001565. The asset has been steadily losing value, and the recent volatility on the market has made this trend worse. Key moving averages indicate additional bearish momentum, and the chart illustrates SHIB's difficulty finding support.\n\nIt is challenging for SHIB to regain its footing because of the resistance levels set by the 200 and 100 EMAs. The entire cryptocurrency market has been impacted by Bitcoins decline below $60,000. Since Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, its performance frequently influences other digital assets. Plunging panic sales have clearly affected altcoins such as Shiba Inu.\n\nShiba Inu has long displayed technical weakness. A bearish trend is indicated by the asset's recent trading below its major moving averages. An oversold state is indicated by the RSI at 27, but a recovery is difficult because there are not any significant support levels below the current price.\n\nInvestor caution has increased as the general outlook for the market has turned negative, according to various sentiment indicators. As a result of traders' reluctance to invest in a market that is declining, SHIB is under additional pressure.\n\nSolana goes down\n\nSolana went down with the rest of the cryptocurrency market, hitting a $135 price threshold, which is considered a critical support level as it coincides with the 200 EMA. The drop below it would be a long-term bearish signal that hints at the continuation of the bearish trend.\n\nThere is increasing pressure on Solana, which is currently trading at about $134. Traders' attention is focused on the 200 EMA at $131.29, which is a critical support level. A break below this mark would probably indicate the continuation of a bearish trend and might trigger additional drops.\n\nIn line with the bearish outlook, Solana has recently sold off and is now below its major moving averages, which include the 50 EMA at $147 and the 100 EMA at $144.\n\nBecause of Bitcoin's recent decline below $60,000, the sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency market as a whole has turned negative. Altcoins such as Solana are facing more pressure due to the wider market downturn. Bitcoin may push Solana down even more if it keeps having trouble.\n\nSolana is getting close to oversold territory. Although this might point to a possible rebound, technical indicators and the general mood of the market point to the possibility that any bounce would be fleeting unless conditions in the wider market improve. Solana may stabilize and possibly rise again if it can maintain its hold above the 200 EMA at around $130."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s recent 10% price drop has caused market speculations, with the global crypto market cap slipping over 8%. Among the notable impacts is the potential $66 million loss for Tron founder Justin Sun.\n\nThis comes amid his active interest in acquiring Bitcoin from the German government to stabilize the market. Notably, the ripple effects of these developments are raising questions about market strategies and future movements.\n\nadvertisement\n\nJustin Sun May Lost $66M Sparking Concerns Over His Bitcoin Buying Plan\n\nEthereum\u2019s sharp decline today has resulted in a staggering potential loss for Justin Sun, estimated at around $66 million. The dip, part of a broader market downturn, has caused significant concern among investors.\n\nAccording to Spot On Chain, Sun\u2019s extensive Ethereum holdings have been deeply affected by this downturn. The report showed that between February and June 2024, Justin Sun acquired 361,137 ETH through three wallets.\n\nMeanwhile, the purchases include 169,604 ETH in February at an average price of $2,870, 176,117 ETH in April at $3,177, and 15,416 ETH in June at $3,474. Just a day before the plunge, Sun was enjoying a $58 million profit.\n\nHowever, today, those gains have turned into a $66 million loss, highlighting the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, these three wallets, which received Ethereum from Binance shortly after Sun\u2019s stablecoin deposits, exemplify his active trading strategy.\n\nBesides, Sun\u2019s swift movements in the market show both the opportunities and risks of high-stakes crypto investments. Meanwhile, amid this setback, questions arise if Justin Sun will remain committed to his strategy of BTC acquisition to minimize the market fluctuations.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-XRP Lawyer Buys The Dip, Eyes Another Lower Entry Point\n\nBitcoin Buying Strategy In Question\n\nWhile grappling with the Ethereum loss, Sun\u2019s focus has also shown his willingness to negotiate with the German government to buy their Bitcoin holdings off-market. German government\u2019s recent significant offloading of Bitcoin has weighed heavily on investor sentiment.\n\nHowever, Justin Sun aims to minimize further market disruptions by acquiring the government\u2019s Bitcoin holdings privately. Sun\u2019s willingness to engage with the German government highlights his broader strategy to stabilize the cryptocurrency market.\n\nMeanwhile, this proposal aims to avoid potential price volatility that could arise from large-scale Bitcoin sales by a government entity. Discussions are expected to explore terms that could facilitate a smooth transfer of these holdings, potentially altering market dynamics.\n\nHowever, the recent market downturn raises questions about whether Justin Sun will stay committed to his plans. Notably, in the past 24 hours, the market has witnessed massive liquidations, with 229,669 traders liquidated, amounting to $639.42 million in total. According to CoinGlass data, the largest single liquidation order, valued at $18.48 million, occurred on Binance\u2019s ETHUSDT pair.\n\nThis wave of liquidations underscores the fragile state of the market and the need for strategic maneuvers to mitigate losses. As of writing, Ethereum price was down 10% and traded near the $2,800 mark. Its trading volume rose 52% to $30 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso Read: Leading Telecom Company Taiwan Mobile Gets Crypto Exchange License\n\nRupam Roy Rupam is a seasoned professional with three years of experience in the financial market, where he has developed a reputation as a meticulous research analyst and insightful journalist.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nINTMAX, a new-gen Ethereum ZK rollup with a stateless architecture, is calling on blockchain developers and privacy proponents to submit their ideas for rewarding users who contribute to privacy on its network. The blockchain team is also a partner and sponsor of the most anticipated EVM ecosystem event in Q3, 2024.\n\nINTMAX L2 calls for privacy-centric rewards tool ideas\n\nINTMAX, a key sponsor and supporter of ETHGlobal Brussels 2024, and a cutting-edge Ethereum layer-2 zero-knowledge rollup, shares the details of its new initiative focused on enhancing privacy in the ecosystem. A $5,000 reward will be offered to an entity or individual who proposes a privacy-centric solution for rewarding network contributors.\n\n#Ethereum developers, solve privacy problems and get the prize! We\u2019re looking for ideas and implementations that reward privacy users (mining or airdrop). See you soon in Brussels \u270c\ufe0f https://t.co/PbWl08r6JM \u2014 INTMAX (@intmaxIO) June 25, 2024\n\nThe suggestions might cover both airdrop-based or mining-based reward models on INTMAX. Submitting just an idea is acceptable, but it must be compelling to outperform someone who has also implemented it. As noted in the documentation, rewarding users for privacy without duplication remains a challenging problem for credible and active networks in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivacy protocols such as INTMAX have a unique dynamic, wherein more participants in the network translates to greater privacy for every user. That is quite unlike most DeFi protocols, where having more users means greater competition for rewards.\n\nThe more participants there are in a privacy protocol contributing their funds and usage, the more privacy is afforded to everyone involved. This is a unique dynamic, where having more \"competitors\" actually benefits each individual user's privacy, unlike typical financial applications, where more users means more competition for rewards.\n\nOn the other hand, the introduction of more users makes it possible for malicious actors to exploit loopholes and obtain lucrative rewards without actually contributing to the privacy of the network. To ensure the integrity of privacy networks and properly incentivize users, it is necessary to close these loopholes.\n\nEnhancing privacy for future token distributions on EVM\n\nThe INTMAX contest is one of several enticing prizes up for grabs at ETHGlobal Brussels, with a total prize pool of more than $450,000 on offer to developers who can stand out from the crowd at one of Europe\u2019s biggest annual hackathon events.\n\nTechnically, the contest invites developers to propose the safest and most resource-efficient implementation of the Quiz mechanism, or else develop a superior solution that solves the challenges of privacy rewards once and for all.\n\nDevelopers are not required to program the deposit and withdrawal process, or even provide any privacy guarantees but simply focus on designing the actual reward system."

        "content": "Fri 05 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Eddy S.\n\nThe Ethereum developers have introduced an Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP-7732. This latest proposal promises to revolutionize the block validation process on the blockchain. This initiative aims to enhance the security and speed of the crypto network by separating the validation process into two distinct parts: consensus and execution.\n\nThe innovations proposed by Ethereum EIP-7732\n\nEthereum EIP-7732, supported by Vitalik Buterin, proposes the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS). A method that divides the creation of crypto blocks between the consensus proposer and the execution proposer. The consensus proposer selects the execution proposer, who commits to producing a valid block containing essential information! Such as a payment or a block hash, for the proposer.\n\nA group of validators, known as the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC), ensures that the execution proposer submits the promised block within the allotted time. This separation aims to reduce the computational load on validators! Thus increasing the efficiency and speed of the crypto network.\n\nEven faster crypto transactions!\n\nEIP-7732 meets the growing demand for efficiency on the Ethereum blockchain. It follows Buterin\u2019s desire to speed up crypto transaction confirmation times. Thanks to the revision of the transaction fees from EIP-1559 and stable block times after the merge (Merge), transaction confirmations on Ethereum are now reduced to between five and twenty seconds.\n\nAlthough these speeds are comparable to those of credit card transactions, certain applications require significantly faster speeds. The impact of EIP-7732 on the market could be significant as it could strengthen Ethereum\u2019s competitive position in the crypto market. The proposal requires a full network upgrade and thorough evaluation by the Ethereum community.\n\nEIP-7732 is a major advancement for Ethereum. It could not only improve the security and efficiency of the network but also open up new possibilities for users and developers. With community approval, Ethereum could take another step towards a faster and more secure crypto ecosystem.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "Bitwise submits the Ethereum ETF filing early, suggesting a mid-July launch.\n\nEthereum price drops but ETH holders are bullish with the potential for price surge.\n\nIn the latest update on the potential approval of a spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF, Bitwise, an asset manager, has taken proactive steps by submitting an amended S-1 form ahead of schedule.\n\nBitwise move amidst unexpected delays\n\nInitially expected to launch around 2nd July, as per Bloomberg\u2019s Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas, the timeline for ETH ETFs has since been adjusted to 8th July following the SEC\u2019s new deadline for firms to amend their S-1 submissions.\n\nFor context, this delay originated from the SEC\u2019s request on 28th May for issuers to address minor queries in their S-1 filings.\n\nRemarking on the same, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got another amended S-1 from @BitwiseInvest for their #Ethereum ETF. Expect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week. We\u2019re thinking these things could potentially list later next week or the week of the 15th at this point.\u201d\n\nAdding to the fray was Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, who recently expressed his optimism about the ETF\u2019s approval, suggesting that the SEC could grant final approval by 12th July, paving the way for trading to start by 15th July.\n\nThe delay was not required\n\nThis has caused significant confusion within the industry regarding the final approval date. However, Bitwise\u2019s early filing of the amended S-1 forms on 3rd July suggests that the products are nearing launch.\n\nProviding further insights on the matter, Balchunas noted,\n\n\u201cProb just wanted to get it off their plate and from what I hear the last round of comments were \u2018literally nothing\u2019 = took zero time to update. Also, no fee yet. Prob get those next week-ish.\u201d\n\nThis has sparked criticism towards SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Many also argue that it\u2019s time for a change in SEC leadership. Echoing these sentiments was X user Circuit, who claimed,\n\n\u201cThis is just Garry throwing this weight around one last time before he is out the door.\u201d\n\nImpact on ETH: Should you be concerned?\n\nUnfortunately, despite Bitwise\u2019s efforts to speed up the ETH ETF process, Ethereum\u2019s price took a hit. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH dropped by 5.09%, trading at $3,189.50.\n\nHowever, AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of IntoTheBlock data reveals that a significant majority (72.06%) of ETH holders currently hold tokens valued higher than their purchase price, indicating they are \u201cin the money.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, a smaller segment (19.07%) holds ETH tokens that are worth less than their purchase price, placing them \u201cout of the money.\u201d This suggests a bullish sentiment or potential upcoming price surge for Ethereum."

        "content": "Mt. Gox has begun repaying creditors who suffered losses when it collapsed in 2014\n\nEthereum fell to an intraday low of $2,825 and seemed to be on course for 4 consecutive daily red candles, at press time\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, crashed to its lowest level since February earlier today as the market reacted to news of activity around a Mt Gox-linked wallet. In fact, such was the scale of the crash that BTC fell below $55,000 on the price charts, down over 9% on the weekly charts.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t alone though, with Ethereum taking BTC\u2019s lead. It recorded worse losses too, with ETH dipping below $3,000 to hit an intraday low of $2,820.\n\nWhale activity also contributed to the losses\n\nEthereum\u2019s freefall also appears to have been exacerbated by whales selling significant Ethereum (ETH) amounts to repay debts on their sunk bets.\n\nIn fact, on-chain data resource LookOnChain revealed that ETH\u2019s price declines posed liquidation risks to Ethereum whales who longed ETH via Aave and Compound. For instance, the tool tracked an address selling 26,600 ETH to repay a debt on Aave in a post on X.\n\nLiquidations\n\nAs expected, Friday\u2019s market bloodbath resulted in nearly $650 million worth of cryptos, including $537 million in bullish bets, being liquidated in just 24 hours.\n\nOver $130 million worth of ETH long positions were forcibly closed in the 24 hours leading to press time too.\n\nMeanwhile, total ETH Futures open interest (OI) across top exchanges declined by almost 12% over the aforementioned period too \u2013 A sign of funds exiting the market.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s CME OI fell by 7.59% too, confirming bearish investor sentiment across the board.\n\nETH/USDT technical analysis\n\nETH/USDT losses, now extending to a fourth day, have piled pressure on the pair. Owing to the same, the pair breached key support levels at the height of the slump. ETH\u2019s price slipped below the 50-, 100-, and 200-simple moving averages on the daily chart.\n\nThe last time ETH/USDT fell below all three trend lines on the daily timeframe was in August 2023. At the time, the crypto market saw losses occasioned by reports of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX selling its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nETH was last spotted at $2,920, ranging 40% below its all-time high, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum\u2019s subdued performance this week has strengthened a bearish outlook in the short term too.\n\nThe ETH/USDT pair is now positioned to face resistance around the $3,200-level, which it previously contended between mid-April and mid-June."

Ethereum and almost all of the top ten altcoins have crashed anywhere between 10-20% with the ETH price losing the crucial support of $3,000.\n\nAltcoin Market Crash, Ethereum Faces Most Liquidations\n\nIn a significant shakeup in the crypto market, 221,704 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours as per data from Coinglass. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance in the ETH/USDT trading pair, valued at $18.48 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the hourly chart, the Ethereum liquidations have exceeded that of Bitcoin as well. In the past hour, the total Ethereum liquidations have shot up to $44.5 million, while the 24-hour ETH liquidations are at $107 million. Liquidations for other altcoins have also shot up singificantly.\n\nDespite all the developments hinting at a spot Ethereum ETF coming by July end, the ETH price has reacted negatively and is largely in tune with the broader market correction.\n\nEthereum developer Anthony Sassano has expressed his views on the current market overhang for ETH, pointing to potential outflows from Grayscale\u2019s ETHE. Sassano noted that ETHE has been trading at a discount of less than 2% for months and is now at a premium, raising questions about how many investors are waiting for its conversion to an ETF before selling.\n\nSassano also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding ETHE\u2019s fee structure post-conversion. He suggested that fees could be much lower than anticipated or even waived temporarily to attract investors to Grayscale\u2019s mini-trust.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Leads Bitcoin By 2x In Network Fee Revenue\n\nFUD Reaches Historic Levels\n\nAs the crypto market continues to decline with more intensity, there\u2019s major fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across social media platforms. On-chain data provider Santiment reported that the \u201csell\u201d mentions have outnumbered the \u201cbuy\u201d mentions every passing hour.\n\nThere have been several instances of this trend in the past 24 hours with the ratio of negative to positive comments reaching its highest in 2024. Santiment suggests that for bold traders, this period of heightened negativity could present an opportunity to adopt a contrarian strategy and buy into the market amidst widespread anger and frustration.\n\nAmong the altcoins, the entire memecoin sector has tanked even more heavily with all of the top memecoins losing between 17-25%. It will be interesting to see whether these meme coins bounce back or if this would be the end of the meme coin mania.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Whale Faces Liquidation, ETH Price Nosedive\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

From Feb to Jun, he allegedly bought 361K $ETH (est. cost: $1.1B) via 3 wallets, including:\n\n\u2013 169,604 $ETH via \u201c0x7a9\u201d in Feb at $2,870 avg\n\n\u2013 176,117 $ETH via \u201c0x435\u201d in Apr at $3,177 avg\n\n\u2013 15,416 $ETH\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bwIezvMRtj \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) July 5, 2024\n\nSpot on Chain noted that the aforementioned addresses always received ETH deposits from Binance following Sun\u2019s stablecoin deposits on the exchange thus leading to suspicions that the Tron founder served as owner of these wallets.\n\n\n\nFollowing the repayment of creditors by defunct exchange Mt. Gox, coupled with a consistent massive Bitcoin sell-off by the US and German governments, the price of Bitcoin has plummeted by 10% over the last two days falling as low as $53,717.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this decline soon extended across the crypto market, with Ethereum crashing by a similar percentage to trade at $2810, marking its lowest price in the last five months. At that point, Justin Sun\u2019s alleged ETH investments reached a $66 million loss.\n\nInterestingly, the Tron founder had reached out to the German government on Thursday to negotiate the sale of their remaining BTC holdings valued at $2.3 billion in a private transaction order. However, it remains unknown if the German government will take up this offer as Sun attempts to reduce the impact of their constant BTC sell-offs on his personal investments and the general crypto market.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum has shown resilience since its earlier slump rising by about 5% to currently trade at $2,975. In tandem, the token\u2019s daily trading volume is up by 47.33% and valued at $30.47 billion.\n\n\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnalyst Predicts Ethereum Nosedive, Cautions Investors To Prepare For $2,700 Target 2 months ago\n\nSolana, Others Record Market Gains Amidst Market Crash\n\nWhile the general cryptocurrency remains in a downtrend, with the total market cap down by 1.02%, several assets have managed to stay afloat providing investors with some form of relief. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Solana is one of these assets, with a 4.99% daily gain alongside other prominent tokens such as Avalanche (AVAX) and Shiba Inu with respective gains of 3.99% and 3.70% respectively.\n\nNotably, prominent meme coin dogwifhat leads the resistance with the highest daily gain of 12.28%.\n\n\n\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from Tradingview"

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s recent survey highlighted the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF could increase US investor interest in Ethereum by 25%.\n\nThis increase in interest is driven by economic concerns like inflation and worries about financial stability, particularly among younger individuals and minority communities. 40% of voters from the previous year desired to invest in cryptocurrency. Due to economic instability, that percentage has increased to 47% this year, indicating that more individuals are interested in digital assets.\n\nSource: Grayscale\n\nAccording to Grayscale\u2019s survey, many Americans are drawn to cryptocurrencies because they see them as a way to achieve financial stability and manage their expenses.\n\nEconomic worries have historically influenced crypto interest. Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply allows it to function like gold, acting as a store of value. Grayscale found that familiarity with cryptocurrencies increases the likelihood of seeing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and other macroeconomic events.\n\nDemographic Ownership Patterns\n\nNearly 70% of people surveyed said they own some form of investment and around 19% own cryptocurrencies. Men, Black and Hispanic voters, and younger people have higher ownership rates. Gen Z respondents, in particular, reported a 31% ownership rate, with many saying they are more interested in cryptocurrencies because of inflation.\n\nDespite the FTX crash, enthusiasm for crypto remains strong in the US. Approximately 40% of investors believe their future portfolios will include Bitcoin.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s data shows that cryptocurrency interest transcends political boundaries. Ownership rates are similar among Republicans (18%) and Democrats (19%). Voters are split on which party is more favorable to the crypto industry, with 30% believing both parties have a favorable stance on crypto policies.\n\nThis balanced interest aligns with recent bipartisan support in Congress for the resolution of SAB 121, enabling banks to serve as custodians for crypto, making it more accessible.\n\nPolitical Views on Crypto\n\nHowever, differences exist in how each party views the importance of crypto-related issues. Republican voters are more likely to prioritize inflation and the economy, with 54% compared to 33% of Democrats. Conversely, Democrats focus more on issues like gun violence, climate change, and income inequality.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin and Ether prices continue to be affected by government sell-offs and Mt. Gox\u2019s repayment. Bitcoin has stabilized around $57,000, while Ether stands at $3,027 as of press time."

        "content": "The Ethereum price has experienced significant volatility recently, rebounding from a low of $2,800 to the current critical level of $3,000. This recovery, marked by a +3% increase in the past 24 hours, comes amid broader market fluctuations and an 11% decline over the past week. With the crypto community closely monitoring the market, the key question is: What lies ahead for Ethereum? In this article, we will delve into the latest trends, provide an Ethereum price prediction, and discuss the implications of potential further declines or recoveries.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: Current Status and Future Outlook\n\nEthereum Price Today: Overview and Analysis\n\nAs of today, the Ethereum price is hovering around $3,000, a crucial level that could determine its near-term direction. This price reflects a modest 24-hour performance increase of +3%, signaling a short-term recovery. However, the past week has been marked by a -11% decline, highlighting the underlying volatility and uncertainty in the market. These fluctuations are common in the cryptocurrency space, making it challenging to provide a definitive Ethereum price prediction.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction: What to Expect Next?\n\nWhen looking at the future of Ethereum, there are two primary scenarios to consider:\n\nRecovery to $3,500: If Ethereum manages to stabilize at $3,200 and continue its upward momentum, it could potentially breach the $3,500 mark. This would signal a strong recovery and could restore investor confidence, leading to further gains. In Euro terms, with a current exchange rate of 1 Euro = 1.08 USD, this would equate to approximately \u20ac3,240.\n\nDecline to $2,000: On the other hand, if the Ethereum price fails to maintain the $3,000 level, it could fall back to $2,800 and possibly drop to $2,600. Should market conditions worsen, a further decline to $2,200 or even $2,000 is possible. These levels would be significant support zones that could either halt the decline or lead to more bearish sentiment.\n\nGiven these scenarios, the Ethereum price prediction remains uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and investor sentiment.\n\nETH/USD 30-mins chart - TradingView\n\nEthereum Price: Recent Performance and Trends\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ethereum has shown a +3% recovery, indicating some buying interest at lower levels. However, the overall 7-day performance reveals an 11% decline, reflecting broader market pressures and potential concerns among investors. This volatility underscores the need for careful analysis and monitoring of market conditions when considering the future direction of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Price and News: Market Influences\n\nThe Ethereum price is influenced by a variety of factors, including broader market trends, investor sentiment, and news developments. Recent Ethereum news has highlighted the cryptocurrency's resilience despite market fluctuations. For example, Ethereum's recent rebound from $2,800 to $3,000 suggests that there is still strong support at lower levels, even as the market remains cautious. Additionally, news about regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market sentiment can significantly impact Ethereum's price and future outlook.\n\nEthereum Crash: Potential Risks and Concerns\n\nDespite the recent recovery, there are still concerns about a potential Ethereum crash. If the market continues to face downward pressure, there is a risk that Ethereum could experience further declines. The key support levels to watch are $2,800 and $2,600, which, if breached, could lead to a more significant drop to $2,200 or even $2,000. Investors should be aware of these risks and consider them when making decisions about their Ethereum holdings.\n\nETH/USD 2-hours chart - TradingView"
