        "title": "SEC sued over Ethereum, crypto firm asks court to state token is not a security - Fortune",
        "content": "A bitter legal fight between the crypto industry and the Securities and Exchange Commission grew more intense on Thursday as Consensys, a major backer of the Ethereum blockchain, filed a lawsuit against the agency in Texas federal court. The complaint seeks to head off an impending SEC lawsuit against the company over features of its popular MetaMask wallet, but also asks the court to resolve one of the biggest legal uncertainties hanging over the crypto industry by stating that Ethereum\u2019s digital token, Ether, is not a security.\n\nIn its 34-page legal filing, Consensys uses dramatic language to argue that the SEC\u2019s efforts to exert jurisdiction over Ethereum is both illegal and a threat to blockchain technology more broadly.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys. Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if he or she were to transfer ETH on the network,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis would bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations.\u201d\n\nThe new lawsuit comes as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler pursues an aggressive enforcement campaign against leading companies in the crypto sector, including Coinbase and Uniswap. In recent weeks, this campaign has involved a wave of subpoenas asking firms and developers for documents related to their dealings with the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, which supports the blockchain\u2019s development.\n\nGensler\u2019s tactics have angered many in the crypto industry who have complained the SEC has failed to provide clear rules or to create a regulatory model that accounts for the distinct features of blockchain technology. Gensler has disputed this, claiming existing securities laws are clear and sufficient, and that the crypto industry refuses to comply with them.\n\nThe controversy over Ethereum has been especially heated since the SEC has signaled repeatedly in the past that the blockchain\u2019s tokens, like Bitcoin, are not securities and therefore outside its jurisdiction. This includes a landmark 2018 speech where a senior official stated that Ethereum had become \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d as well as the agency\u2019s decision last year to allow Ethereum futures trading\u2014an implicit acknowledgement that Ether is a commodity. Meanwhile, video has surfaced of Gensler himself, in his role as a private citizen, telling hedge funds in 2018 that Ethereum is not a security.\n\nThese precedents, however, have failed to dissuade Gensler, who appears to be using a recent feature of Ethereum, known as staking, as grounds for the recent legal campaign.\n\nA warning notice and a preemptive lawsuit\n\nThe Consensys complaint filed on Thursday reveals that the SEC earlier this month issued a so-called Wells Notice, which describes a formal letter warning the agency intends to sue a firm, and often leads to a settlement soon after. The complaint added that, in a related phone call, the SEC told Consensys that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker dealer.\n\nAccording to Consensys, the SEC objects to MetaMask offering users a means to stake Ethereum on their behalf. Staking is a relatively new process for Ethereum, introduced on a blockchain-wide basis in September 2022, that replaced energy-intensive mining with a system of validators who pledge collateral in order to become a trusted validator.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Consensys founder Joe Lubin described as \u201cpreposterous\u201d the theory that staking transformed Ethereum from a commodity into a security.\n\n\u201cThe act of staking is really just posting a security bond so you can get paid to contribute labor and resources to help operate the Ethereum protocol. Now they\u2019re trying to turn that into some sort of investment contract,\u201d Lubin said.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune about the lawsuit or on the agency\u2019s view of the legal status of staking.\n\nLubin also stated that Gensler\u2019s legal position appeared to be an attempt to halt the overall growth of crypto, and to justify the SEC blocking pending applications by companies to launch spot ETFs for Ethereum following the huge popularity of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to regulate a technology on its merits, which the SEC shouldn\u2019t be doing. They\u2019re trying to stifle certain kinds of innovation. And they\u2019re trying to do that because probably they see Ether spot ETFs as a floodgate that\u2019s going to bring a lot of capital into our ecosystem,\u201d said Lubin.\n\nThe Consensys lawsuit was filed in Texas, which dovetails with a broader strategy of the crypto industry to tee up eventual legal appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The circuit has shown greater skepticism of agency actions than other courts and, if the industry can win a favorable judgment, it would likely tee up an appeal for the Supreme Court.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear for now what will happen in the event the SEC chooses to file a lawsuit on its own to follow up on the Wells Notice instead of resolving the issues with Consensys in the Texas court.\n\nThe complaint itself asks the court for a number of additional rulings beyond declaring that Ethereum is not a security. Those include declarations that MetaMask is not a broker dealer, and that the SEC is violating the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process. It also seeks an injunction barring the SEC from conducting any investigations on the premise that Ethereum is a security."

        "content": "The lawsuit from Consensys is demanding that SEC affirm that ether is not a security.\n\nShare this article\n\nConsensys, the crypto firm backing projects critical to the Ethereum ecosystem, has filed a lawsuit against the SEC, alleging the federal agency of regulatory overreach.\n\nThe filing was submitted in a Texas federal court. According to an initial report from Fortune Crypto, the complaint aims to preempt an impending SEC lawsuit against Consensys involving MetaMask, a major crypto and Web3 wallet that the firm has incubated and supported for years. The filing also seeks a court ruling that would declare that Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), is not a security.\n\nConsensys\u2019 34-page legal filing argues that the SEC\u2019s efforts to assert jurisdiction over Ethereum are both illegal and a threat to the broader blockchain technology landscape. The complaint states:\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys. Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if he or she were to transfer ETH on the network. [This] would bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations,\u201d the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has continued with an aggressive enforcement campaign against leading firms in the crypto sector such as Uniswap Labs. The actions involved a wave of subpoena seeking documents related to their interactions with the non-profit Ethereum Foundation. This approach has drawn criticism from many in the crypto industry, who argue that the SEC has failed to provide clear regulations or create a regulatory framework that acknowledges the unique characteristics of blockchain tech.\n\nEthereum\u2019s legal status and classification as a security has been a matter of contention between regulators and the crypto industry. The SEC\u2019s previous stance was that the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s tokens, like Bitcoin, are not securities and as such are outside its purview. This stance has not received any further clarification from the federal agency. Fortune\u2019s coverage of the matter cited how Gensler is now moving to use Ethereum staking as a precedent to pursue the legal campaign against crypto.\n\n\u201cThe act of staking is really just posting a security bond so you can get paid to contribute labour and resources to help operate the Ethereum protocol. Now they\u2019re trying to turn that into some sort of investment contract,\u201d Consensys founder Joe Lubin said.\n\nAccording to the Consensys complaint, the SEC issued a Wells Notice earlier this month, indicating its intent to sue the company and alleging that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer. The SEC\u2019s objection appears to stem from MetaMask offering users a means to stake Ethereum on their behalf, a relatively new process introduced in September 2022."

        "content": "Crypto stalwart joins industry offensive regulator moves to legally define Ethereum.\n\nSEC signalled it is poised to make a move on MetaMask.\n\nStaking is new front in legal war between DeFi and Washington.\n\nConsensys has joined the anti-SEC brigade.\n\nOn Thursday, Consensys, the company behind the popular crypto wallet MetaMask, sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly waging a \u201ccampaign to seize control over the future of cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe firm, which is led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, has locked arms with Coinbase, Greyscale, and the Blockchain Association in the vanguard of crypto industry stalwarts that have challenged the agency\u2019s three-year campaign to clamp down on digital assets.\n\nIn the process, Consensys hopes to protect its own position and one of its crown jewels \u2014 MetaMask, a wallet provider with 30 million users.\n\nAd hoc enforcement\n\nConsensys alleged the SEC is unlawfully deploying \u201cad hoc enforcement actions against Consensys and others.\u201d\n\nIn its lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas, Consensys said the SEC is trying to legally define Ethereum as a security.\n\nThe move alarms industry players because it would force projects to register Ethereum-linked tokens the same way traditional firms do with stocks and bonds.\n\nFor the crypto community, this is anathema because they consider blockchain-based assets as a separate class that deserves its own statutory regime, and rules and regulations. This idea is at the heart of Coinbase\u2019s defence against a lawsuit brought last year by the SEC.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s unlawful seizure of authority over ETH would spell disaster for the Ethereum network, and for Consensys,\u201d read the complaint.\n\nNew front\n\nStaking has opened a new front in the battle between the SEC and the industry since Ethereum switched to a Proof of Stake consensus method for maintaining its blockchain in 2022.\n\nThe SEC has been on a warpath to define Ethereum as a security ever since the network introduced staking that year.\n\nStaking refers to earning rewards from a blockchain network by locking up a cryptocurrency to support the network\u2019s validating nodes.\n\nA person familiar with the case explained that the crypto company had considered several options before moving to file.\n\nCertain elements of the SEC\u2019s investigation into the Ethereum protocol compelled Consensys to defend itself and the ecosystem before the Commission did any real damage, the person said.\n\nConsensys\u2019 complaint came after the SEC notified it was preparing to sue the firm over MetaMask, one of the industry\u2019s most widely used crypto wallets.\n\nThe SEC alleged in its notification that given MetaMask\u2019s \u201cswap\u201d and \u201cstake\u201d features, which let users trade cryptocurrencies and earn rewards on their holdings, Consensys is operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer, according to the filing.\n\n\u2018Ethereum is not a security\u2019\n\nConsensys says the non-custodial wallet is akin to a web browser rather than a trading platform like an exchange.\n\n\u201cAny investigation or enforcement action premised on Consensys operating as a \u2018broker\u2019 under the Exchange Act through its MetaMask wallet software would exceed the SEC\u2019s authority,\u201d said the complaint.\n\nThe crypto firm is asking the court to find that Ethereum is not a security, a move that would ripple across the industry.\n\nThat\u2019s because the SEC has made a series of legal attacks against some of the biggest firms in the industry.\n\nCoinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange, and the SEC are locking horns after the commission alleged that Coinbase is also operating as an unlicensed broker and exchange.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC notified Uniswap, crypto\u2019s largest decentralised exchange platform, that it was operating as an unlicensed broker.\n\nNow, the SEC appears to be turning to peer-to-peer protocols and applications.\n\nLiam Kelly is a Berlin-based DL News\u2019 correspondent.

        "content": "Yesterday blockchain development firm Consensys filed a Texas lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Commissioners, arguing that the SEC is unlawfully claiming that Ethereum\u2019s ETH token is a security. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction preventing the SEC from taking legal action against MetaMask, Consensys\u2019 popular cryptocurrency wallet with more than 30 million monthly active users.\n\nSome redacted parts of the text are worth exploring as they could imply that the SEC has issued some confidential ruling or internal guideline that ETH is a security. Apart from the redactions, the lawsuit explicitly states, \u201cThe SEC\u2019s investigation into transactions in ETH is predicated on a determination that ETH is a security.\u201d\n\nFounded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, ConsenSys is backed by numerous traditional finance (TradFi) firms. These include HSBC, JP Morgan, Mastercard, Microsoft, Softbank and UBS.\n\nMetaMask wallet\n\nConsensys was first informed about the SEC\u2019s interest in MetaMask in April 2022 and has provided considerable information since then. On April 10 Consensys received an SEC \u201cWells Notice\u201d warning of an imminent enforcement action. This was on the grounds that the SEC believes the MetaMask Swaps and Staking services violate federal security laws because Consensys is not a broker dealer.\n\nConsensys argues it is simply providing a user interface enabling access to other services such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and staking protocols. The SEC has also sent a Wells Notice to Uniswap, the leading DEX.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a different jurisdiction, Europe\u2019s latest anti money laundering (AML) legislation imposes requirements on crypto asset service providers, but explicitly excludes self-hosted wallet providers such as MetaMask.\n\nDid proof of stake make ETH a security?\n\nBack in 2018 there was much debate about whether or not ETH was a security. One lawyer in the crypto space raised questions about the patterns in the ETH ICO and concluded it probably was*. However, just a few months later, SEC Director William Henman delivered a high profile speech in which he said ETH was a commodity.\n\nConsensys is understandably unhappy that the SEC has flip flopped on this position. However, since then Ethereum has changed by moving from proof of work to proof of stake (the Ethereum Merge). This involves validators locking up cryptocurrency and earning a return in exchange for helping to secure the blockchain. Based on this, the SEC also targeted Consensys\u2019 sales of ETH from its treasury and asked why Consensys considers these are not sales of securities. Additionally, Consensys received three subpoenas relating to the Ethereum Merge.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only one that relied on the ETH being a commodity. The CFTC continues to say ETH is a commodity. As a result TradFi crypto players such as EDX Markets \u2013 founded by Fidelity, Citadel Securities and others \u2013 only trade Bitcoin, ETH and Litecoin. No license is required for spot trading of commodities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the redactions?\n\nConsensys\u2019 statement that the SEC has taken the position that ETH is a security, combined with redactions in the text, indicates that the SEC\u2019s stance appears to have formally changed.\n\nHere\u2019s one redaction: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s self-aggrandizing about-face on ETH is notable for its lack of transparency. In April 2023, Gary Gensler, the Biden Administration\u2019s crusading SEC Chair, appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. The Committee Chairman repeatedly asked Gensler: does the SEC now think ETH is a security? Gensler refused to answer this direct question from the Chairman of the Congressional committee charged with overseeing his agency. He did not want to admit that his SEC had already secretly cemented its power-grab by issuing an <redacted>.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the text it states, \u201cETH is not a security under the Securities Act, and therefore <redacted> exceeds the SEC\u2019s statutory authority.\u201d\n\nOn the basis of the first redaction, we quizzed ChatGPT to see if it could fill in any blanks. The suggestions it came up with were :\n\ninternal memorandum\n\ndirective to staff\n\nconfidential ruling\n\nclosed-door decision\n\nclassification guideline\n\nenforcement action plan\n\npreliminary determination.\n\nIf, as Consensys implies, the SEC had already made some internal finding that ETH is a security, then given this is an about face, they should publicize it sooner rather than later. That said, Gensler has stated that proof of stake tokens should be regulated as securities for over a year.\n\nWhat about an ETH ETF?\n\nThe crypto markets seem rather sanguine about the latest news of SEC\u2019s position, perhaps because it\u2019s already built in. ETH is up 1% during the past 24 hours. However, the SEC is also expected to approve an ETH ETF. If the SEC believes that ETH primarily trades on unauthorized exchanges, could this serve as grounds for rejecting the ETF? This reasoning differs from the grounds it used to reject previous Bitcoin ETFs, which courts threw out last year. Bitcoin is definitely a commodity, so its spot markets do not need to register.\n\n* in response to the ICO blog post, high profile crypto techie Hasu penned another."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent development on the cryptocurrency market, approximately $500 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been transferred to a wallet linked to Justin Sun, the founder of TRON. According to a tweet by Lookonchain, a prominent crypto analyst, it appears that Sun has withdrawn 7,128 ETH, equivalent to $22.34 million, from the Binance exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis transaction was completed earlier today. Moreover, Lookonchain revealed that the TRON founder has purchased a staggering 154,570 ETH, valued at $492.23 million, at an average price of $3,177, since April 8. The significant movement of Ethereum by Sun has not only drawn attention to his trading activities but also underscored the bullish sentiment that large Ethereum holders, or \"whales,\" maintain toward the cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice impact\n\nDespite Ethereum's recent lackluster performance on the market, with its price currently trading at $3,134, down 3.48% over the last 24 hours, whales like Sun continue to demonstrate confidence in its long-term potential. It is worth noting that while Ethereum's price has experienced a slight decline, its 24-hour trading volume has surged by 30.11%, reaching a total of $14.57 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis increase in trading volume suggests heightened activity and interest in Ethereum among investors, even amid market volatility. Moreover, Justin Sun's recent transactions have further fueled speculation and discussion within the community about the future direction of Ethereum and the broader market. As one of the most influential figures in the crypto industry, Sun's actions often serve as a barometer for market sentiment .\n\nOverall, the movement of such a substantial amount of Ethereum to a wallet associated with one of the most prominent figures in the industry highlights the continued interest and investment in ETH despite its recent price fluctuations. The actions of major players like Justin Sun will undoubtedly remain a focal point for market participants."

        "content": "Stripe Enables Merchants To Accept USDC Payments on Ethereum, Solana and Polygon\n\nPayments giant Stripe has announced its return to the cryptocurrency space after co-founder John Collison revealed their plan to allow merchants to receive funds in the form of the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin. According to Collison, the \u201ctransactions instantly settle on-chain and automatically convert to fiat\u201d and will begin as soon as this summer.\n\nBusinesses utilizing Stripe's technology will have the capability to accept payments made in USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in the crypto market and the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. By embracing USDC, Stripe aims to empower its users by facilitating global transactions and providing customers with easy, fast, and secure payment options, regardless of their access to traditional banking services or credit cards.\n\nJohn Egan, the head of crypto at Stripe, expressed enthusiasm about the integration of stablecoin payments, highlighting the potential to enhance merchants' reach and offer their customers a seamless payment experience. Stripe plans to initially support USDC transactions on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon networks, with additional network compatibility to be announced closer to the launch date.\n\nThis move marks Stripe's reentry into the crypto landscape after its initial foray in 2014 when it became one of the earliest major companies to accept Bitcoin payments. However, the company discontinued its crypto services in 2018 due to rising costs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite this setback, Stripe remained optimistic about cryptocurrencies as a whole."

        "content": "Polkadot\u2019s governance is currently mulling over a proposal to activate SnowBridge, a cross-chain bridge designed to link the Polkadot blockchain with Ethereum.\n\nA cross-chain bridge essentially serves as a decentralized application (DApp), streamlining asset transfers between blockchains to enhance token utility by fostering cross-chain liquidity.\n\nMarket observers have highlighted the significant role SnowBridge would play in enabling Polkadot\u2019s ecosystem to tap into Ethereum\u2019s extensive DeFi landscape.\n\nThe SnowBridge proposal has garnered substantial support from the community due to the potential benefits, t, with all cast votes currently in favor of its implementation. If approved, SnowBridge is slated to go live in 28 days.\n\nWhat is SnowBridge?\n\nSnowBridge is one of the many bridges under development within the Polkadot ecosystem. This initiative, a collaboration between Snowfork and Parity Technologies, aims to revolutionize the movement of Ethereum assets into and out of Polkadot.\n\nCurrently, bridging ERC-20 tokens into Polkadot necessitates using bridges reliant on third-party signatures. While this method is standard in Web3 ecosystems, it poses limitations for Parachains and dApps on Polkadot due to its impact on their trust model.\n\nSnowBridge offers a solution through a trustless model that relies solely on signatures from first-party Ethereum and Polkadot validators. It operates on BridgeHub and is poised to enhance cross-chain interaction between Polkadot and Ethereum.\n\nSnowBridge has been in development for some time and was deployed on the Polkadot parachain testnet Rococo in January 2024. Subsequently, developers utilized it to transfer assets between the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and AssetHub on Rococo, with ERC-20 tokens initially being the sole supported asset type.\n\nSince its deployment, several updates to SnowBridge have been implemented based on thorough testing and audits conducted by the team and security firms.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem. While the Foundation supports our coverage, we maintain full editorial independence and control over the content we publish.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The blockchain race is about to get even more crowded: Movement Labs, a San Francisco\u2013based software development team that\u2019s building a layer 2 Ethereum blockchain, has closed a $38 million funding round, Fortune has exclusively learned.\n\nPolychain Capital, the crypto VC mega firm led by Coinbase alum Olaf Carlson-Wee, led the Series A, with participation from other digital-assets-focused investors including Hack VC, dao5, and Robot Ventures.\n\nMovement\u2019s raise comes on the heels of more sizable rounds for other companies building new blockchains, including Monad Labs, which raised $225 million to build a layer 1, and Berachain, another layer 1 developer that recently announced a $100 million Series B.\n\nWhile the flurry of fundraises reflects a return to crypto-focused venture investments, the concentration of capital around blockchains also indicates an increasingly competitive landscape for companies hoping to build the next Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Movement cofounders Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon said they hope to differentiate Movement by building the first layer 2 blockchain atop Ethereum that utilizes Move, a programming language originally built by Facebook for Diem, its ill-fated stablecoin project.\n\nRead more: We\u2019re Gen Z college dropouts who raised $41.4M for our blockchain startup. Here\u2019s how we did it\n\n\u201cWe are delivering Move to the front door of Ethereum, and it\u2019s this ecosystem that we\u2019re serving,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cA lot of folks who never wanted to leave Ethereum are, for the first time, going to be able to benefit from the security performance of a next-generation virtual machine.\u201d\n\nAccording to Scanlon and Manche, Movement Labs will soon announce its devnet and aims to launch its mainnet in the late summer or early fall. The company also plans to launch its own token, tentatively named Move.\n\nThe Ethereum movement\n\nTo outside observers, the proliferation of new blockchains may seem like overkill\u2014a view often shared by those in the industry. The first, Bitcoin, created the concept of cryptocurrency in 2009; the next major advance came in 2015 with the launch of Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts and the ability to build decentralized applications ranging from exchanges to money-lending protocols.\n\nDevelopers since then have been vexed by blockchains\u2019 speed and cost, with a series of layer 2s built atop Ethereum, as well as new layer 1s such as Solana, promising faster and cheaper transactions. As evidenced by the recent congestion issues plaguing Solana amid its memecoin mania, the problems remain.\n\nTwo recently launched blockchains, Aptos and Sui, came with a new value proposition: Each boasted teams of developers from Facebook who helped build the crypto-focused programming language called Move. They also created the Move Virtual Machine, a kind of computer program undergirding a blockchain that would represent a next-generation update to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nAs Manche and Scanlon explained, while Move and its new virtual machine would come with better security and capabilities than EVM, most developers were still building for Ethereum, which had much stronger community backing. Even if Sui and Aptos could boast better performance, they couldn\u2019t necessarily build a thriving new ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAptos and Sui raised a lot of money,\u201d Manche told Fortune. \u201cBut they failed to execute on the community aspect.\u201d\n\nMovement, in contrast, is building its layer 2 on top of Ethereum but while using the Move programming language and the MVM. It\u2019s also building a tool called Move Stack, which will allow the Move Virtual Machine to be adoptable by other blockchain networks outside of Ethereum. Scanlon said they\u2019ve been contacted by \u201cquite a few\u201d different blockchains, including Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain.\n\nTheir thesis is that developers will want to build using Move, which they say is more intuitive than other languages, such as Solidity, but still be part of the Ethereum community. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to bring Facebook on-chain,\u201d Manche said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the language that Facebook built to Ethereum.\u201d"

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin hit a multi-year low in April.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that the gap between the two could become more pronounced.\n\nInvestors are losing their faith in Ethereum as the cryptocurrency continuously fails to keep pace with Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains.\n\nAnd things could get worse for the world\u2019s biggest altcoin.\n\nNot only have the odds for a US spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund getting approved in May dropped, but Ethereum exchange-traded products suffered $34 million worth of outflows this past week, CoinShares data shows \u2014 making them the only asset group among those CoinShares tracks to register a net outflow since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cETH sentiment is anecdotally at the lowest it has been in years, despite recent developments such as the BUIDL fund by BlackRock,\u201d Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, told DL News.\n\nThe decreasing optimism comes as smaller altcoins, like Solana, have attracted investors who don\u2019t expect Ethereum investments to yield as high returns as they did in the past.\n\nA Bitcoin-driven market\n\nIn previous bull markets, Bitcoin has outperformed other cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the cycle \u2014 a trend that looks to be playing out again.\n\nThis time the focus on Bitcoin has been catalysed by inflows to the 10 US Bitcoin ETFs that launched on January 11.\n\nThey have so far seen over $12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nYet, Ethereum has not managed to capitalise on the rally.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price in Bitcoin \u2014 or ETHBTC \u2014 fell to a low of 0.046 in April, creating the biggest price gap between the two assets in almost three years.\n\nThat means that since ETHBTC peaked in 2022, an investment in Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum by 44%.\n\nThe ETHBTC trading pair shows the price of Ethereum divided by the price of Bitcoin. Traders use this metric to gauge the relative strength of Ethereum against benchmark cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cEven though some people may not view ETH as an altcoin per se, its over- or underperformance relative to Bitcoin is a powerful metric to try and understand what kind of market we are in,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nIf the Bitcoin ETFs continue to steam ahead, the price gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum may become more pronounced.\n\nAnd there\u2019s reason to believe that Bitcoin ETF inflows will continue to soar. Hong Kong recently approved the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, which are set to begin trading April 30.\n\nEthereum ETF approval looks unlikely\n\nWhile Hong Kong also approved a spot Ethereum ETF, the odds of US regulators approving similar funds on May 23 \u2014 the deadline for when they have to either approve or reject VanEck\u2019s application \u2014 are low.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put odds for a May approval at around 25%.\n\nSimilarly, punters on blockchain-based betting platform Polymarket put the odds of an approval at 13%.\n\nThis week, BlackRock amended its spot Ethereum ETF application while competitor Grayscale filed to convert its futures Ethereum ETF to a spot fund.\n\nDespite this, analysts remain sceptical that any US spot Ethereum ETF will be approved.\n\n\u201cThe ETH ETF is almost certainly going to be rejected in May, which has dampened flows into ETH in already existing [exchange-traded] products,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSolana steals the spotlight\n\nAmong so-called altcoins, Ethereum is the largest, with a market value of $384 billion. But this success is a double-edged sword, according to Nolan.\n\n\u201cETH has a large market cap and investors have turned to lower cap alternatives,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nOne popular alternative is Solana.\n\nMost traders assume it would be difficult for Ethereum\u2019s market value to exceed that of Bitcoin. So with Bitcoin sporting a market value of $1.27 trillion, Ethereum traders see limited upside potential.\n\nDespite rallying 546% over the past year, Solana\u2019s market cap is a comparatively low $64 billion, leaving more room for it to grow.\n\nTraders are also starting to pay more attention to Solana\u2019s price compared with other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI have noticed much more attention this cycle vs. last cycle to SOL/ETH and SOL/BTC pairs,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nSigns of hope\n\nThere\u2019s still hope Ethereum could stop bleeding against Bitcoin \u2014 but not for a while.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ethereum ETF should help drive interest. Nolan said he expects an ETF will \u201clikely\u201d be approved in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, if the current bull market repeats previous ones, Ethereum should do better as time goes on.\n\nUntil then, traders will continue to watch the ETHBTC chart closely for clues as to where the top two cryptocurrencies are heading next.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Thomas Zhu, ChinaAMC's head of digital assets and head of family office business, highlighted the benefits of these spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, stating that they provide a regulated framework for retail and institutional investors to safely and conveniently invest in virtual assets. He also expressed expectations of robust demand for their offerings, given the growing adoption of ETFs in institutional asset allocation and retail trading in Hong Kong.\n\nChinaAMC and Harvest Global Investments, whose ETFs were among those approved, have confirmed that they will be utilizing digital asset platform OSL as their \"sub-custodian partner.\" OSL stated that the conditional approval signifies substantial completion of the regulatory vetting process and that they are working intensively to ensure a smooth launch.\n\nWhile it remains uncertain whether investors from mainland China will be able to purchase these ETFs, the potential entry of up to $25 billion into the market is noteworthy."

        "content": "The company claims the SEC plans to treat Ethereum as a security and that the agency is attempting an \u2018unlawful power grab\u2019 through enforcement actions.\n\nBlockchain company Consensys has filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly overreaching in its plans to regulate the Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum is a decentralised blockchain and development platform, which Consensys claims is \u2013 or will be \u2013 the foundation of \u201ccountless\u201d new web3 products and technologies.\n\nThe company alleges that the SEC is attempting an \u201cunlawful power grab\u201d through enforcement actions against Consensys and possibly other blockchain companies using Ethereum. Consensys also claims that Ether \u2013 the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform \u2013 is a commodity and not a security.\n\nThe blockchain company claims apps that allow people to make transactions using Ethereum are not securities brokers and \u201ctherefore cannot be regulated by the SEC\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf allowed to expand its regulatory purview, the SEC would effectively destroy value for hundreds of millions of ether holders and bring use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling the technological evolution of the internet,\u201d the company claims.\n\nThe complaint wants a court to agree with Consensys\u2019 claims that the SEC has no legal authority to regulate ether, software interfaces built on Ethereum or \u201cthe Ethereum blockchain in general\u201d. This complaint has been filed in a US district court in Texas.\n\nThe SEC did not respond to a request for comment from Coindesk on the new Consensys lawsuit.\n\nCrypto crackdown\n\nThe SEC has been cracking down on various crypto trading platforms in the US in recent years. The US agency claims that digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are subject to US securities laws because they are investment contracts. Critics of the SEC claim there the regulations around digital assets in the US are unclear.\n\nLast year, the SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance, claiming the crypto exchanges had acted unlawfully in the country. Towards the end of 2023, Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao plead guilty to US charges and the crypto exchange agreed to pay more than $4bn to resolve an investigation.\n\nLast month, the SEC scored a victory in its lawsuit against Coinbase, when a judge ruled that its claim that the cryptocurrency exchange engaged in unregistered sales of securities could be heard by a jury at trial.\n\nThe SEC is facing a hit from recent criticisms, however. Last week, two SEC lawyers resigned after a US judge sanctioned the regulator for \u201cgross abuse\u201d of power in a crypto case, Bloomberg reports.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

        "content": "San Francisco-based blockchain development firm Movement Labs has raised $38 million in a Series A round led by Polychain Capital.\n\nVenture capital firms Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5 and Aptos Labs also participated in the round for the Move programming language-based project.\n\nMovement Labs co-founder Rushi Manche could not disclose a valuation or the structure of the round but told The Block that \u201cthe substantial capital raised speaks volumes about the immense potential our investors see in our ability to revolutionize the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement shared with The Block, the funding will support Movement Labs\u2019 mission to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum. This project aims to address smart contract vulnerabilities and enhance transaction throughput via the Movement zero-knowledge Layer 2 blockchain.\n\n\u201cThis Series A funding enables us to aggressively hire top talent in engineering, research, product, business development and other key functions to execute our roadmap. [It] allows us to significantly scale our 40+ person team,\u201d Manche said.\n\nMore specifically, Manche told The Block, Movement Labs would be expanding its presence in the Asia-Pacific region and making significant investments in building out its formal verification and security research team. \u201cWe are also doubling down on our zero-knowledge proof engineering capabilities to push the boundaries of scalability and privacy,\u201d Manche added.\n\nMovement\u2019s Layer 2 would expand the usage of the Move programming language beyond the well-known Aptos and Sui Layer 1 blockchains. Move was originally developed at Meta by a team composed of people from Facebook\u2019s now-defunct Diem stablecoin project.\n\nIn terms of the timescale for its rollout, Movement is launching its public testnet, Parthenon, in the coming weeks and is aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of the year, Manche said.\n\nHow Movement's Layer 2 works\n\nThe project's team explained that Movement introduces a new, novel execution environment designed for over 30,000 transactions per second and leverages a fully EVM-compatible bytecode interpreter and Ethereum for settlement to bring parallelization and smart contract security to users who wish to remain within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nReentrancy attacks \u2014 enabling malicious parties to repeatedly drain funds from smart contracts by exploiting the code execution order \u2014 are one of the most common vulnerabilities in DeFi, according to web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi. Movement's Move-EVM aims to prevent attack vectors like reentrancy from executing, allowing developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, the team added.\n\n\u201cThe two biggest issues in blockchain infrastructure at the moment are poor user experience and smart contract exploits,\u201d Manche said. \u201cMy co-founder, Cooper Scanlon and I started building Movement to increase the velocity of innovation in crypto where the next Facebook can be built on-chain by developers who do not have the resources for large development teams and expensive auditors. Move addresses the shortcomings of [the Ethereum programming language] Solidity and we are bringing it to market in a crypto-native way.\u201d\n\nMovement Labs is also developing the Move Stack, an execution layer framework compatible with rollups like Optimism, Polygon and Arbitrum. The Movement Labs team said that it intends to collaborate with projects across the Ethereum ecosystem \u201cto scale smart contract execution for users on all networks and unify them with a shared sequencer implementation.\u201d\n\nMovement Labs previously announced in September it had raised $3.4 million in a pre-seed funding round, with investors including dao5, Varys Capital, Blizzard Fund and Borderless Capital. Angel investors, including Eigenlayer\u2019s Calvin Liu, Berachain\u2019s Smokey The Bera and Avail\u2019s Anurag Arjun, also participated in the round."

(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.) The company claims the SEC plans to regulate Ethereum as a security\u2014which, up to now, the regulator has yet to state publicly.\n\n\u201cThanks [to the founder of Consensys and the rest of the team] for fighting back and defending our industry,\u201d Uniswap founder and CEO tweeted yesterday. \u201cWe're tired of the overreach and harassment.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has a long and contentious relationship with the crypto industry, filing multiple lawsuits against industry leaders such as Binance, Kraken, Uniswap, and Coinbase.

A Wells notice is a letter that the SEC sends to individuals or companies to inform them it plans to take enforcement action and file a lawsuit.\n\nIn its own lawsuit against the regulator, Consensys revealed that it too had received a Wells notice from the SEC after a years-long investigation into Ethereum, the network's transition to proof of stake following the merge, and the Metamask crypto wallet, specifically.\n\nConsensys's preemptive lawsuit seeks to get a court to agree that Ethereum is not a security, thereby nullifying the SEC's claims. It's a move others in the industry have attempted recently as well, including Coinbase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe San Francisco-based crypto exchange is currently tied up in legal battles with the SEC regarding the alleged sale of unregistered securities. In the wake of the Consensys announcement, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal took to Twitter to express his thoughts.\n\nI know ETH is a commodity. You know ETH is a commodity. The CFTC knows ETH is a commodity. It's time for the SEC to admit that it still knows ETH is a commodity too. No more games.

Lubin claims that the SEC wants to \"stifle\" innovation and prevent massive flows of capital into the ecosystem. However, it is worth noting that BlackRock's Larry Fink said that it was possible to launch an Ether ETF even if Ether were to be classified as a security.\n\nThe price of Ether (ETH) is up 0.7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe SEC is currently engaged in heated legal battles with some of the largest cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Uniswap, and Ripple. As reported by U.Today, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicted that the SEC would lose its \"war\" against Ethereum after initial reports detailing the SEC's efforts to crack down on the top altcoin."

        "content": "Furrever Token\n\nNew York, NY, April 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The cryptocurrency landscape is currently witnessing significant movements and regulatory developments that are shaping the future of digital assets. From the SEC's delayed decisions on Ethereum (ETH) ETFs to the surge in Solana's (SOL) network performance and the charming ascent of Furrever Token ( FURR ) , the dynamics within the crypto market continue to offer both challenges and opportunities for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nSEC Delays Decision on Ethereum (ETH) Spot ETFs, Extending Market Uncertainty\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its decision regarding the spot Ethereum ETF applications submitted by Grayscale Investments and Franklin Templeton, casting prolonged uncertainty over the introduction of these investment vehicles on U.S. stock markets. This delay continues the trend of cautious regulatory scrutiny in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector.\n\nPreviously, in a landmark decision last January, the SEC had approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs, which led to significant market inflows and demonstrated a strong investor demand for cryptocurrency-based financial products. Encouraged by this development, Grayscale attempted to convert its existing Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot ETH ETF in October. Shortly after, in February, Franklin Templeton also submitted an S1 form, signaling a robust interest among financial giants to facilitate access to Ether, which ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nDespite the evident enthusiasm and forward momentum from these asset management firms, the path to regulatory approval remains strewn with obstacles. Industry experts, such as those from JP Morgan, express skepticism regarding the rapid approval of these ETFs, estimating the probability of a favorable outcome by the May deadline to be less than 50%. This skepticism reflects the SEC's meticulous strategy in assessing new ETFs, emphasizing the protection of investor interests above all.\n\nThe ongoing postponements prompt speculation about the broader impact on the cryptocurrency market. A denial of these applications might lead these firms to consider legal action against the SEC, highlighting the tense interaction between evolving financial innovations and traditional regulatory frameworks. Nonetheless, the final decision by the SEC will critically shape the market landscape, potentially easing the integration of crypto assets into conventional financial systems or presenting new barriers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs developments continue to unfold, the cryptocurrency community and prospective investors remain keenly focused on the SEC's actions. The forthcoming decisions will be pivotal in determining the future of Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. and will significantly influence the accessibility of digital assets to mainstream investors, marking a critical moment in the integration of blockchain technologies within formal financial systems.\n\nSolana (SOL) Sees 12% Increase as Network Congestion Clears and Block Production Stabilizes\n\nSolana has shown notable signs of recovery today, successfully breaking past the $150 resistance level, with its price now standing at $157.08 according to recent CoinMarketCap data. This 1.81% rise over the past 24 hours marks a significant turnaround for the cryptocurrency which had been struggling with network congestion issues.\n\nThe recovery in Solana's network is primarily attributed to improvements in block production, which has returned to a normal rate with an average block time of two seconds. Recent updates from SolanaFloor indicate that all 409 transactions were confirmed successfully, signaling a robust rebound in network health. This improvement has led to positive speculation about an increase in demand for Solana's native token, SOL.\n\nSolana's network had faced severe congestion problems, causing delays and operational challenges for many projects within its ecosystem. Some projects were forced to postpone their launches, while others sought alternatives, moving their operations away from Solana during the congestion period.\n\nHowever, the situation has seen a dramatic change with the latest update on block production. This development might signal a new phase of growth and stability for Solana, encouraging both current and potential project developers about the network's reliability.\n\nThe resolution of these issues can be credited to the efforts of Solana\u2019s development team, including cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko, who have been actively addressing the scalability challenges. A significant breakthrough was achieved earlier this month when a major fix was implemented on the testnet by the core development team, supported by additional enhancements from other validator clients such as Anza.\n\nThis collective effort has not only resolved the immediate technical issues but also contributed to a substantial 24.5% increase in trading volume, pushing it to over $3.14 billion. The Solana community and investors are now looking forward to a promising future, energized by the network's recovery and the potential for continued growth and enterprise adoption.\n\n\n\nFurrever Token (FURR) Emerges as a Delightful Contender in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nFurrever Token ( FURR ) has made an impressive entry into the cryptocurrency market, quickly setting itself apart from more traditional memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) with its captivating, cat-themed design. Designed to resonate with cat lovers, Furrever Token offers a unique, heartwarming experience that infuses the digital currency space with a new level of cuteness.\n\nStrategically positioned for growth and long-term viability, Furrever Token allocated 65% of its tokens during the presale phase, successfully raising over $1,000,000. This significant achievement highlights the strong investor confidence in the project's vision and potential. Additionally, the decision to lock 10% of the tokens for the team underscores a commitment to the project's future prospects and stability.\n\nFurrever Token has also placed a strong emphasis on security and compliance. Comprehensive audits conducted by Securi Lab have bolstered its credibility, ensuring that the project meets high standards of safety for its participants. Beyond its financial attributes, Furrever Token has fostered a vibrant community atmosphere. Nearly 4,000 active members on Telegram contribute to a dynamic and engaging environment, turning the project into a movement that extends beyond traditional cryptocurrency dynamics.\n\nAs the presale phase draws to a close, anticipation is mounting for Furrever Token's upcoming launch on PancakeSwap. With the potential for returns up to 15X and a current trading price of $0.000648, Furrever Token is poised to capture both the hearts and investments of the cryptocurrency community. It offers a refreshing and cheerful alternative to conventional memecoins, appealing to both seasoned investors and newcomers attracted by its charming theme.\n\nFor anyone seeking further information or needing assistance with Furrever Token, official communications are advised to be conducted through the designated support channel at support(at)furrevertoken.com to ensure authenticity and avoid potential scams.

Every holder of ETH, including Consensys, would fear violating the securities laws if they were to transfer ETH on the network,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis would bring [the] use of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States to a halt, crippling one of the internet\u2019s greatest innovations.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Shiba Inu: Bracing for Bullish Trends? Exchange Reserves Hit 2-Year Low\n\nThe SEC Continues Its Battle Against Ethereum And The Crypto Industry\n\nThe SEC is currently pursuing an aggressive enforcement battle against the cryptocurrency industry. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has unleashed multiple subpoenas, asking firms for documents related to the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, many in the industry have responded negatively to these efforts, saying that the initiative violates privacy and has been totalitarian.\n\nAlso Read: SEC Expected to Deny Spot Ethereum ETF Next Month\n\nFurthermore, the Consensys complaint filed on Thursday reveals that the SEC issued a Wells Notice in early April. This describes a formal letter warning the agency intends to sue a firm. It often leads to a settlement soon after. The complaint adds that, in a related phone call, the SEC told Consensys that MetaMask was operating as an unlicensed broker-dealer. The SEC may follow up with a new lawsuit around the Wells Notice instead of resolving the lawsuit imposed by Consensys in court. However, their plan remains unknown."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYet another CryptoPunk has sold for an astonishing sum: On Thursday, an ultra-rare Alien Punk from the NFT collection traded hands for $12.38 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPunk #635, one of just nine Alien Punks in the influential 10,000-piece Ethereum NFT collection, sold for 4,000 ETH this morning. The sale was facilitated by crypto art brokerage Fountain, with the piece going to an anonymous collector who has yet to reveal their identity.\n\nThe eye-popping trade comes just weeks after two other Alien Punks sold for near-record shattering amounts. In early March, an anonymous crypto trader bought Punk #3100 for $16.03 million worth of ETH, in the second-largest on-chain CryptoPunk transaction ever recorded. Weeks later, Punk #7804\u2014another Alien\u2014sold for $16.42 million in ETH, taking the (silver) crown as the second-most expensive Punk sale in history.\n\nThe largest CryptoPunks sale of all time took place in NFT heyday of early 2022, when a crypto startup CEO purchased yet another Alien Punk\u2014#5822\u2014for 8,000 ETH, worth over $23.7 million at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptoPunk 635, the Alien originally owned by Larva Labs and sold at the Christie\u2019s Contemporary Art Evening Sale in May 2021, has just been acquired by an anonymous collector in a deal brokered by Fountain. We\u2019re honored to have played a small role in this sale. Congratulations\u2026 pic.twitter.com/glisy3MZpv \u2014 Fountain (@Fountainxyz) April 25, 2024\n\nWhile those Punk transactions, and today\u2019s, rank among the most expensive NFT sales of all time, they still pale in comparison to the all-time leader: \"Everydays: The First 5,000 Days,\" an on-chain work by the artist Mike \"Beeple\" Winkelmann that sold for $69.3 million at a Christie\u2019s auction in early 2021.\n\nThe recent resurgence of mind-boggling price tags for CryptoPunk NFTs, however, appears reserved for that collection alone. CryptoPunks, arguably the first NFT collection to attract substantial value and relevance after their creation in 2017, appear to have maintained their position over the last two years as rare cultural artifacts.\n\nOther once-coveted profile picture (PFP) collections have struggled to recapture dominance since the collapse of the NFT market in mid-2022. The Bored Ape Yacht Club, for instance, has seen its assets' value shrink to a floor price barely above $40,000, according to data from NFT Price Floor. That\u2019s down more than 90% from the peak USD price seen back in 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther collections that previously defined the NFT landscape, like Azuki and Doodles, have similarly seen their price floors drop by over 50%.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "The Ethereum network has undergone notable changes in recent times. On September 15, 2022, the network transitioned from a proof-of-work mining model to a proof-of-stake model. This transition has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption, with reports indicating a 99.95% decrease.\n\nA few days ago, the network implemented the Dencun upgrade, which was designed to improve its functionality and performance. However, following this upgrade, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a decline, falling below the $4,000 mark.\n\nETH had recently shown growth, rising by 4.8% in the last seven days. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,150, according to CoinGecko data. ETH is up by 68.5% year-to-date and has regained the $3,100 level recently.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu Makes Crucial Shibarium Announcement: Can SHIB Hit $0.0001 In May?\n\nEthereum Price Prediction for May\n\nAs investors and traders closely monitor Ethereum\u2019s price action, cryptocurrency experts at Changelly have shared their predictions for May. According to their analysis, ETH is expected to reach a minimum price of $3,271 and a maximum price of $3,399. The average price is expected to be $3,335.\n\nThe prediction reveals that ETH is unlikely to hit the $4,000 level by May. The recent surge in Ethereum\u2019s price has been largely attributed to the pump after the recent BTC retrace. With Bitcoin once again showing heightened volatility, the trajectory of ETH remains uncertain.\n\nAlso read: Dogwifhat: Can WIF Hit $10 In May?\n\nDespite the recent price setback following the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum remains one of the most promising and influential blockchain projects in the cryptocurrency space. Its robust ecosystem, which hosts a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continues to drive innovation and adoption.\n\nHowever, Ethereum also faces challenges, such as high gas fees and scalability issues, which have led to the rise of competing blockchain networks.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 AI Cryptocurrencies To Buy For Gains As Nvidia Report Drops In May"

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Movement Labs , a San Francisco-based blockchain development team, has secured $38 million in a Series A financing round led by Polychain Capital. The funding will support the company's mission to bring Facebook's Move Virtual Machine to Ethereum, addressing smart contract vulnerabilities and enhancing transaction throughput.\n\nMovement Labs Series A Funding\n\nThe investment round saw participation from prominent venture capital firms including Hack VC, Placeholder, Archetype, Maven 11, Robot Ventures, Figment Capital, Nomad Capital, Bankless Ventures, OKX Ventures, dao5, and Aptos Labs, demonstrating strong industry confidence in the Movement ecosystem.\n\nFounded in 2022, Movement Labs aims to tackle the prevalent smart contract vulnerabilities within the Ethereum ecosystem while introducing a novel execution environment designed for 30,000+ transactions per second (TPS). By leveraging a fully EVM-compatible bytecode interpreter and Ethereum for settlement, the Movement Zero-Knowledge Layer 2 blockchain will bring parallelization and smart contract security to users who wish to remain within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, hackers exploited smart contracts for over $5.4 billion, affecting major protocols like Curve and KyberSwap through common reentrancy attacks. Movement's Move-EVM allows Move and Solidity developers to deploy code that is fully verified at runtime, preventing attack vectors like reentrancy from executing. The team calls this the \"Integrated Approach\", where multiple modular elements such as shared sequencing, embedded formal verification provers, alternative data availability, and Ethereum settlement can combine to power one blockchain, enhancing security and performance.\n\n\"The two biggest issues in blockchain infrastructure at the moment are poor user experience and smart contract exploits,\" said Movement Co-Founder, Rushi Manche. \"My Co-Founder, Cooper Scanlon and I started building Movement to increase the velocity of innovation in crypto where the next Facebook can be built on-chain by developers who do not have the resources for large development teams and expensive auditors. Move addresses the shortcomings of Solidity and we are bringing it to market in a crypto-native way.\"\n\nIn addition to the flagship Movement L2, Movement Labs will introduce Move Stack, an execution layer framework that is compatible with many of the rollup frameworks from companies like Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The team's vision is to collaborate with other Ethereum players to scale smart contract execution for users on all networks and unify them with a shared sequencer implementation.\n\n\"While the core focus of most other rollup teams is scalability, Movement's key insight is that scalability alone is not why we are yet to see mass adoption. The MoveVM offers a developer experience that is intuitive and bug-resistant as well as highly scalable. By marrying these benefits with the network effects and base-layer security guarantees of the Ethereum ecosystem, we believe Movement can build a flourishing ecosystem that is home to a new generation of mainstream applications,\" said Polychain's Bobby Beniers in a statement.\n\nThe team had previously announced a $3.4 million pre-seed round in September 2023. Users will be able to interact with its network this Summer.\n\nFor more information about Movement Labs and a guide to participate in the devnet, please visit: movementlabs.xyz , follow on X @movementlabsxyz and on Discord .\n\nAbout Movement Labs:\n\nCo-founders, Rushi Manche and Cooper Scanlon, early builders in the Move ecosystem, founded Movement Labs in 2022 as the first integrated blockchain network, powering the fastest and most secure Layer 2 on Ethereum. Designed to pair smart contract security and parallelization with EVM liquidity and user bases, Movement is bringing the MoveVM to Ethereum through its flagship L2 and connected rollups with the Move Stack.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\n[email protected]\n\nVideo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2396978/Movement_Labs_Fundraise_Video_Final.mp4\n\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2397018/movement_logo_full_color_rgb_2000px_72ppi_Logo.jpg"

        "content": "Ex-Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal says the altcoin market cap is on the verge of soaring to new all-time highs (ATHs).\n\nIn a new video update, the Real Vision CEO says that the digital assets market could enter \u201ccrypto summer\u201d within a month, when Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and other alts could have massive rallies.\n\nA \u201ccrypto summer\u201d generally means increased prices, higher trading volume, bullish market sentiment, more network development and wider adoption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very normal for crypto spring for Bitcoin to outperform and then as we come into crypto summer that we\u2019re transitioning into now ETH starts to outperform Bitcoin\u2026\n\nWill it outperform Solana? I very much doubt it. Solana is earlier in the adoption curve so it means the percentage changes are larger.\n\nYou can see the start of crypto spring, which was the breakout of this pattern and the slight acceleration. That says we\u2019re getting to warmer days of spring as it were. But really, summer happens when you break the previous all-time high in market cap and things go utterly bananas. So this [chart below is altcoins] excluding Ethereum, so this is the rest of the space, really starting to accelerate and sometime in 2024 we will hit an all-time high market cap of altcoins and this chart will go truly into the banana zone.\u201d\n\nPal also predicts that the crypto market will have a \u201ccrypto fall\u201d similar to the 2013 and 2017 cycles when the market extended rallies even higher. Many analysts believe that crypto runs in four-year cycles and divides the cycles up into four seasons of the year to explain the different phases.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about crypto summer just in very simplistic terms. Here is the chart of the seasons. So spring is green. We had a great spring this year. Summer is when a lot of the gains start to happen. Fall was tricky last time around. We got a stunted cycle. If you remember that kind of double-toppy style thing.\n\nIt was highly unusual. 2017, and 2013 were typical of the fall season. And so we don\u2019t know how this one\u2019s going to play out. I think it plays out more like 2013, 2017, but it\u2019s all assessing the odds as we go. But right now this is the easy year, the summer.\u201d\n\nPal predicts that crypto summer will begin in the next month to month and a half.\n\n\u201cVery soon, like in the next month, next month and a half, we will start to hit the banana zone. And this is what happens when you hit the banana zone. Things get absolutely wild, which is the really magical part of why this is the greatest macro trade of all time is this part and it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nLooking at his chart, Pal suggests that during \u201ccrypto summer\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) could soar into the six-figure range, reaching as high as $300,000.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The SEC\u2019s mindset toward approving spot Ether exchange-traded funds was never clear as the SEC tries to classify Ethereum (ETH) as security and delays its decision on spot Ether ETF for several issuers.\n\nUS SEC to Refuse Spot Ether ETF Approval\n\nIssuers of spot Ether ETFs and other firms expect denial of their applications next month by the U.S. SEC after bad meetings with the securities regulator in recent week, reported Reuters on April 25.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, VanEck, Ark Invest and other issuers have filed with the SEC to approve and list ETF tracking the spot prices of Ether (ETH), similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs. VanEck and Ark Invest are first in line for the SEC\u2019s decision on May 23 and May 24, respectively.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the SEC and its staff have shown no interest in the spot Ether ETF and its potential. Four people who participated said the discussions were one-sided.\n\n\u201cIt seems more likely that approval will be delayed until later in 2024, or longer,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF analysis at data firm VettaFi, who is tracking the issue closely. \u201cThe regulatory picture still seems cloudy.\u201d\n\nThe SEC is taking a similar stance against spot Ether ETF when Gary Gensler-led agency rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs for more than a decade. The Grayscale Investments\u2019 win in a lawsuit against the SEC forced the regulator to consider spot Bitcoin ETF approval, but Gensler was still not interested in it after the approval.\n\nThe denial will be a setback for the crypto market as participants believe spot ETFs pave the way for rising adoption of crypto, as seen in spot Bitcoin ETF. Also, spot XRP and SOL ETFs can be expected if the SEC approves the spot Ether ETF.\n\nThe SEC has only disclosed one meeting on spot Bitcoin ETF, which was in March. The SEC and Coinbase met to discuss Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Ethereum Trust into spot Ether ETF.\n\nETH Price Fall on This News\n\nWhile Hong Kong regulator has approved spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs and listing is expected on April 30, traders have responded immediately to the news of delay.\n\nETH price extended drop to over 5%, with the price currently trading at $3,097.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have experienced a downturn post-Bitcoin halving, marked by lower trading volumes.\n\nEthereum and Solana are struggling to break key resistance levels at $3,200 and $150, respectively.\n\nXRP remains volatile amid the ongoing legal battle with the SEC, facing hurdles at $0.52-$0.55 range.\n\nDespite a brief upward swing following last week's halving, cryptocurrency markets have dipped in the second half of the week. Lower trading volumes are characteristic of the post-halving period.\n\nAmong major altcoins, has attempted a comeback, nearing the $3,200 mark, but a clear reversal hasn't materialized yet.\n\nfaces a similar situation, battling to break above $150. remains particularly volatile as the ongoing SEC lawsuit against heats up.\n\n1. Ethereum Eyes Breakout After Correction\n\nEthereum's decline took a breather last week, finding support near $3,000. During the April 13-19 trading sessions, the daily chart suggests buying activity (reaction purchases) emerged around the $2,920 zone.\n\nThis coincides with the Fibonacci 0.618 retracement level of the Q1 rally, hinting that the recent correction might be over.\n\nHowever, ETH's week-long uptrend has struggled to overcome the $3,200 resistance due to low trading volume. In the past 24 hours, selling pressure has intensified, with $3,150 acting as a key hurdle.\n\nAnalysts warn that a daily close below $3,150 could signal a continuation of the downtrend. A potential weekly close under $2,920 could open the door for a further slide towards $2,600.\n\nConversely, a surge in buying volume that pushes ETH above $3,150 would be a significant breakout. This would signify an end to the downtrend that began in March and could pave the way for a return to the $3,600-$3,800 zone in the short term.\n\n2. Solana Breaks Support, Faces Downward Pressure\n\nSolana started April on a concerning note, breaking below the ascending channel it had followed since October 2023. This downward breakout came with significant trading volume, pushing SOL to an average price of $127 last week.\n\nThe recent price movement suggests a corrective phase for SOL. While the token has attempted a recovery since last week, it remains capped at an average of $158.\n\nThis week, the $139-$143 range becomes crucial support for SOL. Failure to hold this level could see SOL experience a significant decline, potentially dropping below $100 as the downward trend strengthens.\n\nDaily closes above $160 are essential to confirm a reversal of the downtrend. As long as SOL remains below this price point, selling pressure could push it further down.\n\nMaintaining an average of $140 would also be a positive sign, potentially slowing the decline.\n\nOn the upside, if SOL can establish a solid foundation at $160, the next potential targets could be the $180-$190 range.\n\n3. XRP Faces Volatility as Legal Battle Heats Up\n\nXRP's price has been on a rollercoaster ride this week, reflecting the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The market reacted negatively to Ripple's recent rejection of the SEC's proposed fine, halting the recovery XRP experienced last week.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, XRP dipped below its long-term upward channel earlier this month. While there were attempts to return to the channel last week, a significant resistance level emerged around $0.55, hindering further progress.\n\nThe long-term outlook for XRP presents another hurdle in the form of resistance at $0.52 (Fib 0.236). A weekly close above this crucial $0.52-$0.55 range is critical for XRP to reverse its current trend. Failure to do so could lead to a short-term decline towards the support level at $0.43 (Fib 0.144).\n\nLooking ahead, with Ripple's response submitted and the SEC's defense still to come, the XRP market is likely to experience increased volatility in the coming months. The final court decision is expected to be a major factor influencing XRP's price as we approach summer.\n\n***\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship \"Tech Titans,\" which outperformed the market by a lofty 1,745% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here and never miss a bull market again!\n\nDisclaimer: This content, which is prepared purely for educational purposes, cannot be considered as investment advice.

        "title": "Ex-Ethereum Advisor Reaffirms ETH Is A Security Amid Consensys Vs SEC Lawsuit - CoinGape",
        "content": "In a bold move, former Ethereum advisor Steven Nerayoff has reaffirmed that Ethereum (ETH) is indeed a security. In a series of scathing posts on social media platform X, Nerayoff accused Ethereum of being centralized since its inception. Moreover, he alleged that it has operated as a security since its initial coin offering (ICO).\n\nEx-Ethereum Advisor Reacts To Consensys Vs SEC Lawsuit\n\nNerayoff\u2019s affirmation comes amidst an ongoing legal battle between Joseph Lubin\u2019s Consensys and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, filed by Consensys, aims to prevent Ethereum from being declared a security. The former Ethereum advisor labeled it as a move to \u201ccover up\u201d prior collusion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn one of his posts, Nerayoff declared, \u201cIt\u2019s an undeniable fact that Ethereum is centralized and has been a security since the ICO. This move is to distract people from the truth and just another cover-up.\u201d Moreover, he further accused Ethereum of engaging in \u201cmajor securities fraud\u201d through speculative ICO purchases and undisclosed whale holdings.\n\nFurthermore, the former advisor also spotlighted key figures within Ethereum\u2019s leadership, including Joseph Lubin and Vitalik Buterin, alleging their involvement in fraudulent activities. Nerayoff pointed to Lubin\u2019s significant purchases during the ICO as evidence of securities fraud, a claim supported by SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s assertion that Lubin acquired 9.5% of the ICO.\n\nIn addition, Nerayoff alleged collusion between Ethereum and the SEC. He cited a meeting between Lubin and former SEC official Bill Hinman prior to the latter\u2019s speech declaring Ethereum not a security. According to Nerayoff, this coordinated effort aimed to conceal Ethereum\u2019s true centralized nature, contradicting claims of decentralization.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking: Consensys Fights for Ethereum, Sues SEC to Block Regulation\n\nSteven Nerayoff Connects XRP\u2019s Legal Woes To ETH\n\nFurthermore, in a surprising twist, Nerayoff linked Ethereum\u2019s controversy to the ongoing SEC case against Ripple. He suggested a broader conspiracy to monopolize the crypto market. Additionally, he accused the SEC of biased treatment towards Ripple while targeting Ethereum\u2019s only competition, echoing sentiments from the XRP community.\n\n\u201cThe XRP case has exposed the collusion between the SEC, FBI, DOJ, and other big entities to monopolize the crypto market,\u201d Nerayoff asserted. Furthermore, he called for Ripple to be exonerated and Ethereum to be held accountable for its alleged misconduct.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s allegations have reignited scrutiny over Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status. Moreover, it has raised questions about the SEC\u2019s handling of crypto enforcement. As the legal battle between Consensys and the SEC unfolds, the community awaits clarity on Ethereum\u2019s regulatory status.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price Analysis: Will ETH ETF Denial Jitters Trigger Sell-Off To $2,500?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "title": "Is ETH About to Plunge Below $3K or Will the Bulls Step In? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "After a period of consolidation and corrective movements, Ethereum\u2019s price has encountered increased selling activity, leading to a slight decline toward the 100-day moving average.\n\nThe main question now revolves around whether Ethereum sellers will manage to break below this crucial moving average.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: Technicals\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA thorough analysis of the daily chart reveals that following an extended phase of corrective retracements, with the price testing the critical resistance region of $3.2K, the market experienced heightened selling pressure, resulting in a slight downturn.\n\nConsequently, the Ethereum price is now testing a crucial support level marked by the 100-day moving average at $3086. This range holds significance as it typically attracts considerable demand, potentially limiting further downward pressure from sellers.\n\nHowever, given the current market sentiment and recent price action, Ethereum appears to lack sufficient momentum and buying activity, increasing the likelihood of a new bearish trend in the short term. Nonetheless, an unexpected breach below this critical support zone could trigger a cascade effect towards the 200-day moving average at $2.5K.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nA closer examination of the 4-hour chart reveals that following a period of sideways consolidation near the lower boundary of the wedge pattern, which aligns with the support region around $3K, the price experienced notable buying pressure, leading to a bullish reversal.\n\nThis intensified demand resulted in a significant surge towards a critical resistance region, encompassing the 0.5 ($3234) and 0.618 ($3324) Fibonacci levels.\n\nHowever, sellers regained control and halted the upward momentum, causing a renewed bearish downturn, indicating a notable bearish sign for the market. Nevertheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to remain confined within the crucial range, bounded by support at $2.8 and critical resistance at $3.3, until a breakout occurs.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nWith Ethereum\u2019s price failing to surpass the $3.7K level, investors may be interested in understanding the behavior of futures market traders.\n\nThe accompanying chart displays the 14-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that gauges the aggressiveness of buyers relative to sellers. Values above one signify buyer dominance, while values below one indicate aggressive selling pressure.\n\nAs depicted in the chart, not only has the metric failed to recover above one, but it has also been on a sharp decline over the past few weeks. Moreover, the ratio has recently been steadily decreasing, nearing its lowest point since September 2022. This downward trend is concerning and suggests that Ethereum\u2019s bearish trend could last in the mid-term if current conditions persist."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Analysis: Will ETH ETF Denial Jitters Trigger Sell-Off To $2,500? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum Price Analysis: The cryptocurrency market continues to face headwinds after Bitcoin halving \u2014 an event anticipated to impact the supply of the largest digital asset significantly. Ethereum, like Bitcoin price and other altcoins, reveals emerging weakness with investors expressing confusion by selling their holdings. The modest 5.7% decline in ETH\u2019s value alongside BTC\u2019s 4.5% reflects the generally bearish outlook across the market.\n\nEthereum hovers at $3,105 during US business hours on Thursday. The 32% surge in the trading volume side-by-side with the price drop reveals reduced risk appetite and investor willingness to close open positions. On top of that, a 5% correction in the market cap to $382 billion mirrors the precarious state of the crypto market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SEC Set To Deny ETH ETF \u2013 Issuers Reckon\n\nThe optimism for a spot Ethereum Exchange-traded fund (ETF) gained momentum in Q1 after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a bunch of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSeveral potential ETH ETF issuers moved to file with the agency for approval to operate the products in the United States. Market sentiment on Ethereum improved significantly, with experts projecting a similar impact to the BTC ETF on the price of Bitcoin which hit a new all-time high of $73,837 in March, CoinGecko data shows.\n\nHowever, according to the latest report, the SEC could move to deny Ethereum ETFs. The report published by Reuters cited issuers of the ETF and other companies who said that the regulator is not eager to meet with them.\n\nSo far nine firms have filed proposals with the SEC to list Ethereum ETFs including VanEck, and ARK Investment Management. Spot ETFs track the price of Ethereum in real-time.\n\nThe SEC is expected to decide on the first proposals filed by VanEck and ARK Invest by May 23, 2024.\n\nBased on the report, communication with the SEC has not been substantive and mainly one-sided. Contrary to this, the SEC frequently met with issuers of Bitcoin ETFs before the approval in January where they discussed details related to the new investment offers.\n\nDue to the one-sided state of communication, potential issuers of Ethereum ETFs say that they expect the regulator to deny their applications.\n\nWhile the launch of Bitcoin ETFs was the main driving force, the lack of a spot ETE ETF may derail the ascent to new all-time highs. Moreover, the state of the crypto market is delicate with negative denial news likely to add to the selling pressure, triggering a sell-off to $2,500.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis As More Declines Linger\n\nThe Money Flow Index (MFI) below the 40 mark reinforces the bearish grip on Ether. In other words, there\u2019s more money flowing out than into Ethereum markets, exerting more pressure on the price which is currently 24% below the 2024 peak of $4,089. The token also sits below two bull market indicators, the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50-day EMA (the blue and red lines on the chart).\n\nIf Ethereum price closes the day below $3,100 resistance/support, the chances of a flash drop under $3,000 will increase. The 200-day EMA (purple line) will provide support at $2,740, possibly preventing further losses to $2,500.\n\nNevertheless, the correction could flip profitable if Ethereum price gains momentum from the forming falling wedge pattern. A break above the upper trend line could encourage traders to buy ETH betting on a trend reversal toward the $4,000 mark.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market shines a spotlight on several Ethereum meme coins to buy that are currently valued under one dollar. Notable among these are Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI). Each of these digital currencies has seen impressive gains recently, attracting the interest of investors aiming for significant returns. Their growing popularity may suggest they are viable options for turning a small investment into considerable profits in the volatile crypto market.\n\n1. Pepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe (PEPE), a new cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, is swiftly gaining traction. It aims to match or surpass the success of iconic meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Currently holding the 35th spot in market rankings, Pepe coin boasts a market cap of $3.22 billion.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEnhanced support from platforms like Coinbase and significant acquisitions by large-scale investors have propelled its visibility and value. Market trends and a rise in similar meme coins also contribute to Pepe bullish momentum.\n\nPresently, the Pepe price is $0.000007638, marking a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. This recent surge has positioned it as today\u2019s most popular meme coin on CoinMarketCap. Over the last week, it has witnessed a substantial 47% increase. Over the past 12 months, PEPE value has skyrocketed by 3368%, highlighting it as a potential investment for significant returns this weekend.\n\n2. Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu Coin (SHIB) continues to flourish within the decentralized finance realm. As another Ethereum-based digital asset, it has recently seen a 3% rise in its value. The current price of Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002577, suggesting continued growth. With a 146% increase over the past year, SHIB remains a strong contender in the market.\n\nRanked 11th by CoinMarketCap, SHIB has a market capitalization of $15.18 billion. Factors such as enhanced trading volume, strategic token burns, and the introduction of Shibairum are driving its upward trajectory. This makes SHIB another attractive meme coin for potential investors looking for substantial gains.\n\n3. Floki (FLOKI)\n\nFloki (FLOKI), initially recognized as a meme coin, has evolved significantly in the web3 realm. It now engages prominently in the Metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Dubbed \u201cThe People\u2019s Crypto,\u201d Floki integrates popular internet culture with cutting-edge, practical projects.\n\nAs of now, Floki price stands at $0.0001885, marking a 4% increase in the last day. It holds the 55th position in global market capitalization, valued at $1.8 billion, and is showing promise for substantial future gains following trends seen in other Ethereum-based meme coins.\n\n4. Grok (GROK)\n\nGrok (GROK) is carving out a space in the meme coin sector. It gains its inspiration from the Grok AI project by Elon Musk\u2019s X company. This association has significantly heightened its profile, pushing it to the forefront of AI-related meme cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrok price is trading at $0.008313, reflecting a slight 2% dip over the past day. With a market capitalization of $52 million, it is ranked 596th on CoinMarketCap, highlighting its position among the top Ethereum meme coins.\n\n5. Bonk (BONK)\n\nBonk (BONK), a newly minted dog-themed cryptocurrency on the Solana network, has made a significant splash by allocating half of its tokens to the Solana community. This strategy has vaulted its market capitalization to a robust $1.74 billion. At the time of writing, the Bonk price is trading at $0.00002667, which represents an 8% increase over the past 24 hours.\n\nThis trend reflects a 79% rise over the past week and an astonishing annual gain of 4100%. Such dynamics suggest BONK could be a lucrative investment, especially as it rides the growing popularity of Solana, positioning itself as a top meme coin with the potential for exponential gains.\n\n6. CorgiAI (CORGIAI)\n\nCorgiAI (CORGIAI) has carved a niche within the artificial intelligence sphere, fueled by a vibrant community-driven project. The introduction of its Corgi Cre8r tool, enabling users to generate text-to-image NFTs, showcases its commitment to innovation.\n\nDespite a slight 1% dip in its price today, CorgiAI\u2019s token, currently valued at $0.001672, has surged 542% this year. This impressive performance highlights its appeal as a promising investment among Ethereum meme coins, hinting at substantial returns for future investors. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is 3097, with a market cap of 507 million.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, these selected Ethereum meme coins represent promising opportunities for investors. With their low entry price and recent upsurge in popularity, they are prime candidates for potentially lucrative investments this weekend.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Supply on Exchanges increased in the last few days.\n\nETH was down by over 2%, and indicators looked bearish.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has witnessed a considerable amount of outflow from exchanges over the last week. This happened while its price action was bullish.\n\nHowever, the market turned bearish in the last 24 hours. Did this have a negative impact on ETH\u2019s outflow?\n\nEthereum\u2019s outflow surged!\n\nEthereum\u2019s price rested comfortably above the $3k mark as its price rallied by more than 6% in the last seven days.\n\nWhile that happened, investors stockpiled ETH, hinting that they expected the token\u2019s price to rise further in the coming days.\n\nTitan of Crypto, a popular crypto analyst, recently posted a tweet highlighting this fact.\n\nAs per the tweet, crypto exchanges witnessed an outflow of over 260,000 ETH, equivalent to more than $781 million, within the past seven days.\n\nAdditionally, Justin Sun also accumulated ETH. As per a recent tweet from Lookonchain, a wallet that possibly belongs to Sun withdrew 15,389 ETH, worth $49.78 million, from Binance again.\n\nThe wallet earlier had bought 147,442 ETH, worth $469.9 million at $3,179 since the 8th of April.\n\nHowever, the last 24 hours witnessed a change in market sentiment as most cryptos\u2019 prices dropped. According to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by over 2%.\n\nAt press time, the king of altcoins was trading at $3,165.53 with a market capitalization of over $386 billion.\n\nIs ETH\u2019s price drop affecting buying pressure?\n\nSince the token\u2019s price dropped, AMBCrypto checked its metrics to find whether this had any impact on buying pressure.\n\nOur analysis of CryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that ETH\u2019s net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the last seven days\u2019 average. This signaled that investors have started to sell ETH.\n\nThe token\u2019s exchange outflow declined in the last few days. Additionally, the fact that investors were selling Ethereum was further proven by its supply-on-exchange graph as it went up.\n\nNotably, the price decline didn\u2019t affect whale accumulation. This seemed to be the case as ETH\u2019s supply held by top addresses continued to rise last week.\n\nGoing forward\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed ETH\u2019s derivatives metrics and technical indicators to see if the rise in selling pressure could further impact its price. The token\u2019s Funding Rate increased.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nGenerally, prices tend to move the other way than the Funding Rate. This movement suggested a continued price drop for ETH.\n\nTechnical indicators also looked bearish. For instance, both ETH\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Money Flow Index (MFI) started to decline, showing a continued price drop in the coming days."

        "content": "Cynicism around Ethereum grew on social media due to the expectation of the rejection of Ethereum\u2019s spot ETF.\n\nPrice movement of ETH remained stable, and velocity and network growth remained the same.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has been struggling around the $3,100 to $3,200 mark over the last few weeks after its recent crash.\n\nWord on the street\n\nDespite these factors social activity around Ethereum grew, but not all of it comprised of positive discussions.\n\nSantiment\u2019s data indicated that traders were focusing on recent reports which suggested that the SEC may reject proposals for spot Ethereum ETFs in May.\n\nMuch of the community believes that the significant increase in cryptocurrency value since mid-October can be attributed to the positive sentiment resulting from the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nHowever, current indications suggest that the SEC may not be ready to approve other assets at this time.\n\nAs regularly observed, historical data suggests that prices often move counter to popular expectations. Increasing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) due to trader impatience could actually benefit non-Bitcoin assets.\n\nThere has already been a notable increase in bearish sentiments among traders, as most assets have retraced considerably since Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high on 14th April. Therefore, there is a higher likelihood of relief bounces occurring in the next week.\n\nWhile a softened stance or a surprise approval could initially boost Ethereum\u2019s value, overly eager traders\u2019 fear of missing out may lead to a mid-term drop, providing opportunities for large holders to lower prices.\n\nRegardless, if mainstream sentiment is selling the rumor, there historically tends to be a justification for buying the news.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for ETH?\n\nAt press time ETH was trading at $3,151.30 and its price had fallen by 0.35% in the last 24 hours. The volume at which it was trading at had also fallen by 4.04% during the same period.\n\nThe network growth had moved sideways over the last few days, implying that new addresses weren\u2019t particularly showing interest in ETH at the time of writing.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nThe velocity at which ETH was trading was also moving sideways indicating that the frequency at which ETH was being traded at had remained stagnant.\n\nThe network growth and velocity moving sideways suggest that there may not be any significant fluctuations in price in the near short term for ETH."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s NFT sales volume and transactions dipped last month.\n\nSOL\u2019s price action remained bearish, and indicators suggested a further price drop.\n\nSolana [SOL] witnessed a year-long summer in its NFT ecosystem as the blockchain outperformed its competitors. However, Solana\u2019s NFT metrics started to decline in the past month. Meanwhile, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish.\n\nSolana\u2019s NFT ecosystem is shining bright\n\nSolanaFloor, a popular X handle that posts updates related to the blockchain, posted a tweet highlighting SOL\u2019s commendable performance.\n\nAs per the tweet, SOL outperformed every other chain, including Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Polygon [MATIC], in yearly NFT blockchain user adoption.\n\nWhile SOL\u2019s number of users grew by 33% in the past 365 days, MATIC, BTC, and ETH\u2019s users grew by 29%, 10%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s look at DappRadar\u2019s data revealed that MadLads, Frogana, and Sharx by sharky.fi were the top NFT collections on Solana, which might have contributed towards the aforementioned achievement.\n\nDespite promising 365-day growth, things started to change in the last month. AMBCrypto\u2019s look at Cryptoslam\u2019s data pointed out that SOL\u2019s NFT sales volume dropped by over 36% last month, as did its total number of buyers and sellers.\n\nIts total NFT transactions also dipped by 11%. Santiment\u2019s data also corresponded to this, as SOL\u2019s NFT trade count sank sharply over the past month.\n\nSolana investors need to worry\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s NFT metrics dipped, the token\u2019s price action also turned bearish. According to CoinMarketCap, SOL was down by over 25% last month.\n\nIn fact, in the last 24 hours alone, the token\u2019s value dropped by 7%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $145.55 with a market capitalization of over $65 billion, making it the 5th largest crypto.\n\nThe decline in price also took a toll on the token\u2019s social metrics. SOL\u2019s social volume declined over the past month, reflecting a decrease in its popularity in the crypto space.\n\nAdditionally, Solana\u2019s weighted sentiment also remained in the negative zone for the majority of the days. This clearly suggested that bearish sentiment around the token was dominant in the market.\n\nAMBCrypto then analyzed the token\u2019s daily chart to find whether this bearish price trend would continue longer. We found that both SOL\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) started to decline and were headed further below their respective neutral marks.\n\nRead Solana\u2019s [SOL] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nAdditionally, the token\u2019s price also failed to go above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), as suggested by the Bollinger Bands.\n\nAll these technical indicators hinted that investors might witness a further drop in SOL\u2019s price in the coming days or weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Whales continued to stockpile ETH despite being under water.\n\nMajority of whale positions were longing ETH in derivatives markets.\n\nEthereum [ETH] sank 4.73% over the last 24 hours of trading, reversing the bullish momentum which it gathered following Bitcoin\u2019s halving. The second-largest cryptocurrency was exchanging hands at $3,125 as of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe slump however, failed to influence the market behavior of whale investors, as the latter still seemed bullish on ETH\u2019s prospects.\n\nWhales buy ETH\u2019s dip\n\nAccording to on-chain tracking platform Spot On Chain, whales accumulated hefty amount of ETH in the last 24 hours.\n\nA particular wallet with address 0xe0b snapped 1,524 stETH at an average price of $3,159. With this grab, the wallet owner pushed their total stETH holdings beyond $10 million, earning an estimated 3.42% profit.\n\nIn a bigger purchase, a whale amassed 7,128 ETH, worth $22 million at prevailing prices, at $3,111. The wealthy investor reportedly sat on a huge $482 million worth of ETH stash.\n\nAs of this writing, the holder was in a state of unrealized loss.\n\nSupply held by top addresses increase\n\nThese were not isolated developments though. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment\u2019s data, ETH whales upped their transaction activity in the last 2-3 days, as seen by the jump in large transfers exceeding $100k.\n\nMoreover, the share of total supply held by top addresses rose from 41.37% on the halving day to 41.45% on the 24th of April, suggesting accumulation by whales.\n\nWhales still betting on ETH\u2019s rise\n\nOn the derivatives markets too, majority of the whales were bullishly positioned. About 63% of the total whale positions on Binance were long on ETH, as per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Hyblock Capital data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nThough, it was worth mentioning that the long exposure came down after the halving.\n\nThe market sentiment leaned towards greed, indicating the possibility of increase in buying pressure in the days to come. This could support ETH\u2019s rebound in the days ahead."

        "content": "Most of the bets predicted a bullish close for BTC and ETH.\n\nETH might drop below the max pain point while BTC might end the week above it.\n\nMore than 96,000 option contracts of Bitcoin [BTC] and 978,000 for Ethereum [ETH] are set to expire on Friday, 26th April.\n\nAccording to derivatives exchange Deribit, the BTC contracts were valued at $6.2 billion while ETH contracts were worth $3.1 billion, bringing the total to a mind-blowing $9.3 billion.\n\nWith options, traders can purchase contracts that allow them to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price. As options near expiry, traders must decide if to buy, sell, or close the contract.\n\nOptimism rises despite the decline\n\nDetails AMBCrypto got from Deribit showed that the BTC put-call ratio was negative. This indicates that most of the bets were calls and traders were bullish on the coin price.\n\nIt was a similar case for ETH. For those unfamiliar, buying a call option means that a trader will make money if the price goes up. On the other hand, a put option is a bearish bet, meaning a trader will make profits if the price declines.\n\nDepending on where BTC and ETH prices close, the exchange noted that sellers might gain the most if BTC hits $61,000. In ETH\u2019s case, buyers might lose a lot of money if the value of the altcoin reaches $3,100.\n\n\u201cBitcoin options and the removal of a 61k max pain price point, together with the expiring open interest of nearly $3 billion in Ethereum options and the removal of a $3.1k max pain price point.\u201d\n\nAt press time, BTC\u2019s price was $64,140, representing an 8.52% decrease in the last 30 days. ETH, on the other hand, changed hands at $3,129\u2014 a 12.46% 30-day decrease.\n\nDifferent patterns for the top two\n\nTo ascertain where the price might close this week, AMBCrypto looked at the liquidation heatmap. Liquidation heatmap shows traders high areas of liquidity (magnetic zone).\n\nThis helps to identify potential large liquidation points, and the possibility of prices moving toward certain regions. According to data obtained from Hyblock, a magnetic zone (colored yellow) appeared on the BTC liquidation heatmap at $67,250.\n\nTo the downside, another magnetic area was at $62,600. If Bitcoin\u2019s price moves toward $67,250, then most option contracts will end up making money from their bets.\n\nOn the other hand, a decline toward $62,600 could cause losses. However, the pain might be minimal as long as the price does not hit $61,000.\n\nHowever, it might not be the same case for traders who went with the ETH call option.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s ETH\u2019s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAt press time, the high area of liquidity was around $3,025, indicating that the price might decline below the $3,100 max pain threshold.\n\nIf this happens, a large part of the $3.1 billion set to expire could be wiped out. However, if ETH stays above $3,100, puts might not be the only ones to gain from the price action."

        "title": "Ethereum validators stay put \u2013 Where does that leave ETH\u2019s price? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Voluntary exit on Ethereum fell to a one-month low.\n\nDespite last week\u2019s price rally, bearish sentiments remain significant in the ETH market.\n\nThe daily count of validators exiting the Ethereum [ETH] network recently cratered to a 30-day low, data from Glassnode showed.\n\nThis occurred due to the recent decline in demand for the proof-of-stake (PoS) network. AMBCrypto previously reported that user activity on Ethereum has declined over the last month.\n\nThis resulted in a low ETH burn rate, which has increased the coin\u2019s supply and made it inflationary once again.\n\nWhen ETH becomes inflationary, its price experiences significant downward pressure. According to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, the coin\u2019s value has dropped by 13% in the last month.\n\nDue to ETH\u2019s low price action, validators on the Ethereum network have not been incentivized to unstake their coins for onward sales.\n\nThe network typically witnesses a surge in validator exit when ETH price climbs, causing validators to attempt to capture gains on their previously staked coins.\n\nWith fewer validators leaving the network, the participation rate among validators has also risen to its highest in the last month.\n\nValidators must participate in the network to ensure that Ethereum runs optimally. A high participation rate indicates reliable validator node uptime, fewer missed blocks, and superior blockspace efficiency.\n\nAs of this writing, the validators\u2019 participation rate on the network was 99.6%.\n\nETH gains, but at what cost?\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,150, recording a 5% value uptick in the last week. This price growth has been due to a minor resurgence in bullish sentiments among market participants, which AMBCrypto gleaned from its readings of the coin\u2019s key technical indicators on a one-day chart.\n\nFor example, the coin\u2019s MACD line rested above its signal line at press time. This signaled that ETH\u2019s short-term moving average is above its long-term moving average. It is viewed as a bullish signal and interpreted as an indication to take long and exit short positions.\n\nLikewise, the coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of money into and out of the market, returned a positive value at press time. This showed that the ETH market had a steady liquidity supply.\n\nHowever, bearish sentiments lingered in the market. The value of the coin\u2019s Elder-Ray Index was -61.96 at the time of press. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

        "content": "There are several blockchain networks competing for a piece of Ethereum\u2019s smart contract and DeFi market share. Projects like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Polkadot, and Avalanche are some of the most prominent \u201cEthereum killers\u201d.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications and smart contracts. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most widely used platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nHowever, it also faces some challenges, such as high gas fees, network congestion, scalability issues, and environmental concerns. Therefore, many other blockchain platforms have emerged as potential competitors or alternatives to Ethereum, offering different features and advantages.\n\nIn this article, we are going to examine the most prominent Ethereum competitors and look into the pros and cons of 6 crypto projects that are vying to become the next Ethereum.\n\nNative Coin Total Unique Add.

Analyzing the top 6 \u201cEthereum killers\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the \u201cnext Ethereum\u201d, we are referring to cryptocurrency projects that are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology for developing DeFi and NFT solutions, which is currently the arena Ethereum is dominating thanks to its first mover advantage. In the following sections, we are going to examine six projects with robust feature sets and active communities that could challenge Ethereum\u2019s dominating market share in the future.\n\n1. BNB Smart Chain\n\nBNB Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain platform launched by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Powered by its native token BNB, BSC aims to provide an alternative to the Ethereum network by offering faster and cheaper transactions. It achieves this by using a different consensus mechanism called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). BSC's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows developers to easily migrate their dApps from Ethereum to BSC, leveraging its high throughput and low fees.\n\nWhy is BNB Smart Chain considered the next Ethereum?\n\nThanks to a large number of users, familiar features that are heavily inspired by the Ethereum blockchain, and backing by the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, BNB Smart Chain is considered the top Ethereum killer.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-currencies. It leverages a unique combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) mechanisms to achieve fast transaction speeds and low fees. Solana's scalability and throughput make it an attractive option for developers looking to build complex applications that require high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhy is Solana considered the next Ethereum?\n\nSolana is one of the most energy-efficient and cheapest crypto networks for transferring value. In addition, Solana features a healthy ecosystem of dApps and an active community, despite SOL\u2019s rapid price decrease last year due to its connection with the now defunct FTX exchange.\n\n3. Cardano\n\nCardano (ADA) is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and sustainable infrastructure for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Built using a peer-reviewed academic approach, Cardano boasts a high level of security and scalability. It utilizes a unique consensus algorithm called Ouroboros, which ensures that the network remains decentralized while maintaining fast transaction processing.\n\nWhy is Cardano considered the next Ethereum?\n\nCardano is not only one of the most popular crypto projects but also one of the most actively developed blockchains in the space, making it not only one of the top Ethereum killers but also a potentially good investment overall.\n\n4. Tron\n\nTron (TRX) is a blockchain platform that aims to create a decentralized digital entertainment ecosystem. It focuses on providing a decentralized infrastructure for content creators and consumers in the entertainment industry. Tron offers high throughput and low transaction fees, making it suitable for applications such as gaming, social media, and digital content distribution.\n\nWhy is Tron considered the next Ethereum?\n\nOver the years, Tron has emerged as a credible alternative to Ethereum due to its transaction speed and overlapping features. In recent years, Tron has also looked to expand its offering, integrating decentralized file-sharing capabilities with the acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) and launching a decentralized stablecoin, USDD.\n\n5. Avalanche\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is a highly scalable blockchain platform that prioritizes speed, security, and decentralization. It utilizes a novel consensus protocol called Avalanche, which enables high throughput and fast finality. Avalanche's unique approach to consensus makes it highly resilient to attacks and allows for quick transaction confirmations, making it an attractive choice for developers seeking a scalable and secure blockchain platform.\n\nWhy is Avalanche considered the next Ethereum?\n\nAvalanche\u2019s focus is on overcoming some of Ethereum's scalability and speed limitations. While the blockchain itself is capable of processing about 150 times the number of transactions as Ethereum, Avalanche has struggled to build a dApp and NFT ecosystem that could challenge Ethereum, at least so far.\n\n6. Polkadot\n\nPolkadot (DOT) is a multi-chain platform that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across different blockchains. It aims to create a decentralized internet where different blockchains can communicate and share information securely. Polkadot's unique architecture allows for interoperability between different chains, facilitating seamless data transfer and enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains simultaneously.\n\nWhy is Polkadot considered the next Ethereum?\n\nPolkadot was conceived by Gavin Wood, a computer scientist and co-founder of Ethereum. Wood launched Polkadot with the intention of enhancing scalability with \u201cparachains\u201d, which enable parallel processing of transactions, allowing Polkadot to handle a larger volume of transactions compared to Ethereum.\n\nWhich are considered \u201cEthereum killer\u201d coins?\n\nIn addition to the blockchain networks described above, like BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, and Polkadot, there are numerous other platforms considered members of the group of Layer 1 networks called Ethereum killers.\n\nSome examples of blockchain platforms that have an overlapping feature set, such as Ethereum, include several smaller market cap projects, including Cosmos, Ethereum Classic, Near Protocol, Tezos, Algorand, and Fantom.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that several Layer 2 solutions that aim to alleviate scalability issues on the Ethereum network, like Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism, are also considered by some as Ethereum competitors. However, that categorization would be somewhat nonsensical, as these solutions aim to enhance the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, not replace it.\n\nAre Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology, but they have different purposes and features. Bitcoin is designed as a digital currency and a store of value, while Ethereum is a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Therefore, they are not direct competitors but rather complementary projects that aim to solve different problems using blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, from the perspective of traders and investors, Bitcoin and Ethereum may be seen as competitors as they vie for market share and adoption. Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it has a high level of security, decentralization, and network effects. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it has a high level of innovation, functionality, and scalability. Both cryptocurrencies have their advantages and disadvantages, and their performance may vary depending on market conditions and user demand.\n\nThe bottom line: There are several blockchain platforms vying to become the next Ethereum\n\nEthereum was the first major blockchain platform to build the necessary infrastructure and building blocks to support the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized financial systems, and new tokens, thanks to the ERC-20 token standard. Since its launch in 2015, numerous other networks have tried to overcome Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage, but to no avail. BSC comes the closest, especially in terms of active users. However, the ecosystem of products and services is considerably smaller on BSC than on Ethereum. Other networks, like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, are even further removed, despite their ability to process considerably more transactions and at a lower price than Ethereum\n\nFor more information about whether it is a good idea to buy Ethereum, and what are the pros and cons of investing in Ethereum, you can check the video below."
