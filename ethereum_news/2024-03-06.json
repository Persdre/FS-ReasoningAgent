        "content": "Bitcoin's all-time high cranks up pressure on Ether to follow suit.\n\nInvestors are counting on Ether ETFs to spur gains.\n\nAn Ethereum upgrade is on the way.\n\nBitcoin just hit a new high, and the wider crypto market is now worth more than $2.6 trillion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s not been lost in the bullish run-up, rallying more than 65% since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s impressive, but sitting at $3,809 in late afternoon trading UK time Wednesday, Ether is still 21% below its all-time high of $4,800.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nIn a word, time.\n\nSzymon Sypniewicz, CEO of crypto onboarding solution Ramp, said it may simply take longer for the market to understand Ethereum\u2019s complexity, especially \u201ccompared to the much simpler idea of Bitcoin as digital gold.\u201d\n\nNew financial system\n\nEthereum lovers have long argued the second most valuable blockchain network will be the infrastructure of an entirely new financial system.\n\nThrough smart contracts, supporters point to a future with more transparent markets, tokenised versions of popular funds, and faster settlement times.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOthers say it\u2019s only a matter of time before institutional investors take bigger positions in Ether. And the advent of Bitcoin ETFs may be increasing their appetite.\n\n\u201cETH hasn\u2019t hit its institutionalised hype cycle yet,\u201d like Bitcoin has, Robby Greenfield, co-founder and CEO of payments protocol Umoja Labs, told DL News. \u201cThus, the vast majority of new inflows from the BTC ETF will naturally lead toward greater buy pressure, along with the upcoming BTC halving,\u201d\n\nGreenfield predicted that Ethereum will close the gap with Bitcoin in terms of its gains.\n\nHe told DL News the cryptocurrency should \u201cclear $10,000 this year.\u201d\n\nGreenfield added that an Ethereum ETF approval would undoubtedly help drive up its value. He joins a host of industry players counting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to follow up its January approval of Bitcoin ETFs with a green light for Ether.\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be good for investors to have access to ETH in a way that\u2019s easy and familiar.\u2019 \u2014 Eugene Cheung, Bybit\n\n\u201cAn ETH ETF should naturally be approved,\u201d Eugene Cheung, Bybit\u2019s head of institutions, told DL News. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for investors to have access to ETH \u2014 one of the world\u2019s premier risk assets \u2014 in a way that\u2019s easy and familiar.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but the SEC, and especially its hard-charging chair, Gary Gensler, may take a different approach to an Ether ETF.\n\nGensler acknowledged reluctantly clearing the way for Bitcoin after the commission lost a court ruling in its effort to stop Grayscale from converting its BTC trust into an ETF.\n\nThere is no such court case driving decision-making on an ETH ETF.\n\nThe SEC is expected to weigh in on a slew of different Ethereum ETF applicants, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, in May.\n\nCrypto prediction market Polymarket puts the odds of approval at 43%. JPMorgan\u2019s latest analysis gives it a 50% chance.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called an Ethereum ETF \u201csmall potatoes,\u201d characterising it as \u201cthe opening act coming on after the headliner.\u201d\n\nEthereum upgrade\n\nJPMorgan does, however, point to another catalyst for Ethereum: the Dencun upgrade, which is designed to help the network scale up by cutting costs for various rollup solutions on the market.\n\nRollups batch crypto transactions, be they simple swaps or borrowing activity, into much smaller chunks of data.\n\nThese small chunks are then settled on Ethereum, reducing the overall data footprint on the network.\n\nBybit\u2019s Cheung says this is good news for Ethereum supporters.\n\n\u201cWith layer 2 solutions built on top of Ethereum, the blockchain is becoming the settlement layer for a whole new digital infrastructure encompassing gaming, trading, and investing,\u201d he told DL News.\n\n\u201cThe value of all of this will tend to accrue to the ETH asset.\u201d\n\nUnlike Bitcoin\u2019s automated halving event, Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade does not regulate the cryptocurrency\u2019s scarcity. In contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s pre-programmed 21 million token cap, Ethereum\u2019s supply is infinite.\n\nNot a sure thing\n\nStill, the upgrade\u2019s success isn\u2019t a sure thing for the asset\u2019s price performance.\n\nThe layer 1 competition is heating up, and one exec says Ethereum may even be overtaken this cycle.\n\n\u201cGiven the network\u2019s poor performance during periods of high activity and the proliferation of alternative layer 1 protocols that have optimised for Ethereum\u2019s shortcomings, Ethereum\u2019s position as the second-ranked cryptocurrency is not necessarily guaranteed this cycle,\u201d CMO of crypto exchange VALR, Ben Caselin, told DL News.\n\nLiam Kelly is DL News\u2019 Berlin correspondent.

He stressed the importance of investor awareness, particularly pointing out Bitcoin\u2019s recent price movements. \u201cBitcoin is a speculative asset,\u201d he remarked, highlighting the essence of cryptocurrencies as volatile investments.\n\nGary Gensler continues to call #Bitcoin a highly speculative asset class even after it has gone up over 200% in the last year \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nWe are not selling our Bitcoin, Gary.pic.twitter.com/VYmchXY0Kn \u2014 The \u20bfitcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) March 7, 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s Status\n\nGensler classified Bitcoin as a commodity but remained silent on Ethereum\u2019s categorization. Asked whether Ethereum should be considered a security or a commodity, he chose to defer, citing ongoing applications that preclude a definitive answer. \u201cI will not comment on Ethereum today,\u201d he stated, keeping the crypto community in suspense.\n\nYESTERDAY ON BLOOMBERG #SEC`s GARY GENSLER WAS ASKED AGAIN IF #ETHEREUM IS A SECURITY?\n\n\n\nHIS RESPONSE \u27a1\ufe0f [\u2026] BUT WE DO HAVE FILINGS IN FRONT OF US.

This aligns with the SEC\u2019s cautious stance towards digital tokens, advocating for increased oversight.\n\nGensler\u2019s latest comments reflect a careful balance between caution and open-mindedness, emphasizing the need for investor caution."

        "title": "The crypto wallet of Donald Trump reaches 7.5 million dollars - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In the dynamic world of crypto, former US President Donald Trump has once again made headlines for his digital asset wallet that has reached a remarkable amount of 7.5 million dollars.\n\nFeeding off the rapid rise of MAGA and the gains of Ethereum, the cryptocurrencies owned by Trump have experienced a surge, capturing the attention of enthusiasts and skeptics alike.\n\nTrump in the crypto world: the $7.5 million wallet\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s foray into the world of cryptocurrencies has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nAfter attracting attention for his digital assets exceeding 5 million dollars, the former 45th President of the United States saw his cryptocurrency portfolio rise to a whopping 7.5 million dollars in just a few days.\n\nThis meteoric rise has been fueled mainly by the rise of MAGA $TRUMP and the appreciation of the value of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nTrump\u2019s increase in cryptocurrency wealth can largely be attributed to the impressive performance of MAGA, a digital asset bearing his name.\n\nOver the course of ten days, the value of TRUMP tokens has increased from 2.98 million dollars to a whopping 4.66 million dollars, marking a significant 56% increase in value.\n\nThis surge in the value of MAGA underlines the growing popularity and speculative frenzy surrounding meme coins in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn addition to his involvement in TRUMP, the crypto Donald Trump wallet includes other significant activities.\n\nAmong these, 950,000 BABYTRUMP tokens, valued at 93,000 dollars, and another cryptocurrency also called TRUMP, distinct from the maga version, valued at 18,000 dollars.\n\nHowever, it is the exponential growth of MAGA that has attracted the most attention and speculation within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nTrump\u2019s wealth in cryptocurrencies is further strengthened by his holdings in Ethereum, acquired through the sale of non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\nCurrently, the former president owns 370 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) worth 1.43 million dollars and 342 ETH worth 1.29 million dollars.\n\nThe appreciation of the value of Ethereum has significantly contributed to the overall growth of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\nWill Trump monetize his assets?\n\nDespite the substantial increase in value, the question remains whether Trump will decide to monetize his digital assets, especially his significant stakes in TRUMP.\n\nGiven the current high valuation, many within the cryptocurrency community are speculating on Trump\u2019s next move and whether he will decide to capitalize his fortune in cryptocurrencies.\n\nA potential obstacle that Trump may encounter in liquidating his holdings in TRUMP is the limited availability of exchanges that support the token.\n\nUnlike more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, TRUMP may not be listed on traditional exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nInstead, platforms like Uniswap v2, Raydium, and Orca are among the most popular for buying and trading $TRUMP.\n\nDespite the recent fluctuations in the value of MAGA, with a 3.5% drop in the last day, the token has seen significant growth in the last month, with a 408% surge compared to the US dollar.\n\nThis volatility highlights the speculative nature of meme coins and their tendency to undergo rapid fluctuations in value.\n\nAs Donald Trump\u2019s crypto wallet continues to attract attention and speculation, the former president remains a prominent figure in the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether he will decide to keep his thriving cryptocurrency portfolio or cash in on its current value.\n\nHowever, one thing is certain: Trump\u2019s foray into cryptocurrencies has captured the imagination of both supporters and skeptics, highlighting the growing mainstream interest in this emerging asset class.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Donald Trump\u2019s foray into the world of cryptocurrencies has proven to be a profitable venture, with his portfolio experiencing exponential growth in a short period of time.\n\nThe surge in value of TRUMP, along with the appreciation of Ethereum, has pushed the cryptocurrencies owned by Trump to new heights, reaching the impressive amount of 7.5 million dollars.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and innovate, Trump\u2019s wealth in cryptocurrencies is a testament to the potential and inherent value in this class of emerging assets.\n\nHowever, amid the excitement surrounding Trump\u2019s growth in cryptocurrencies, there are still questions about the future trajectory of his holdings in digital assets and whether he will choose to capitalize on the current valuation or maintain a long-term investment strategy.\n\nRegardless of his next move, Trump\u2019s involvement in cryptocurrencies highlights the growing mainstream interest in digital assets and their role in shaping the future of finance.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Donald Trump\u2019s portfolio represents a symbol of the potential advantages and risks associated with this expanding market, leaving many to speculate on what the future holds for one of the most important political figures in the world in the realm of digital finance."

        "content": "Ethereum price is coiling up for a move north with abounding bullishness amid broader market optimism.\n\nWith Dencun upgrade and Ether ETF speculation, ETH could make it to the $4,000 psychological level.\n\nThe liquidity rotation could bode well for Ethereum betas ARB, LDO, MANTA and Op, which are beginning to wake up.\n\nAll eyes remain peeled on Ethereum (ETH) price after Bitcoin price had its own day earlier this week when it recorded a new all-time high (ATH) at $69,324. While Ether\u2019s all-time high of $4,868 remains a rather ambitious target for now, the $4,000 threshold may come sooner than expected with the right drivers.\n\nAlso Read: Nearly $200 million in ETH burned as Ethereum gears up for Dencun upgrade\n\nBullish outlook among Ethereum holders\n\nEthereum (ETH) price is eyeing the $4,000 psychological level, a region last tested in January of 2022. Ether price could hit its target soon as two bullish fundamentals steer the Ethereum price.\n\nEthereum holders are anticipating the two catalysts that are likely to drive an ETH price rally this cycle. The upcoming Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) Hard Fork and the SEC\u2019s decision on the Spot Ethereum ETF are the two catalysts for the altcoin.\n\nThe ETH price continues to increase as investors appear to be pricing in the positive effects of the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the possibility that the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) approves exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Ether before the year is out.\n\nThe next in line for a potential all-time high test is #Ethereum.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n- Dencun upgrade.\n\n- Potential Spot ETH ETF approval.\n\n\n\nCrucial resistance is approaching, but the $BTC pair has barely moved.\n\n\n\nWe'll likely see more strength coming from this asset. pic.twitter.com/LyWh8ht9ow \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 6, 2024\n\nWith these two fundamentals at play, Ethereum betas are likely to benefit, potentially becoming the next sector category to explode. Already, some of them are waking up, including Arbitrum (ARB), Lido DAO (LDO), the Manta Network (MANTA) and Optimism (OP). The liquidity from the Ethereum market could spill over into these betas to inspire a surge in their prices.\n\nIn the meantime, data according to Token Terminal shows that the Ethereum network leads by far with $34.6 million on metrics of the top 25 projects in all market sectors based on daily cumulative fees. The Uniswap network follows at a distance with $6.3 million.\n\nMarket sectors daily cumulative fees\n\nOn metrics of active daily users, however, the Ethereum network does not fare so well, coming in at position seven after Bitcoin and Solana, respectively.\n\nMarket sectors active users\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price is edging close to the $4,000 psychological level after breaching the $3,900 milestone. At the time of writing, Ethereum price is trading for $3,924.\n\nETH/USDT 3-day chart, ARB/USDT 1-day chart, LDO/USDT 1-day chart, MANTA/USDT 1-day chart, OP/USDT 1-day chart"

        "content": "In this (ETH) price prediction 2024, 2025-2030, we will analyze the price patterns of ETH by using accurate trader-friendly technical analysis indicators and predict the future movement of the cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Current Market Status\n\n\n\nETH Current Market Status (Source: CoinMarketCap)\n\nWhat is Ethereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum (ETH), known as Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that revolutionized the blockchain and DeFi sector by the introduction of smart contracts. This second-generation blockchain was launched in 2015. Its native crypto coin, ether (ETH) was launched through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2014. The entire Ethereum network is fueled by Ether (ETH).\n\nThe blueprint of the Ethereum network was first released in its whitepaper in 2013 by Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Since its launch, the blockchain-based software platform functions as a potential launchpad for several other crypto tokens, DeFi protocols, and numerous decentralized applications (dApps). Thus, Ethereum is regarded as the \u201cworld computer.\u201d\n\nThe smart contracts are coded programs that execute autonomously with pre-defined conditions on Ethereum. These smart contracts are deployed and executed via the Ethereum Vending Machine (EVM).\n\nEthereum will transition to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus through The Merge upgrade. Initially, the Ethereum network was built on the high energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) since its launch. From 2020, the Ethereum developers have begun preparing for the PoW to PoS transition. The Merge upgrade is set for September 15. After this transition, the Ether (ETH) which was an inflationary token will convert into a deflationary token.\n\nEthereum 24H Technicals\n\n(Source: TradingView)\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024\n\nEthereum (ETH) ranks 2nd on CoinMarketCap in terms of its market capitalization. The overview of the Ethereum price prediction for 2024 is explained below with a daily time frame.\n\nETH/USDT Ascending Channel Pattern (Source: TradingView)\n\nIn the above chart, Ethereum (ETH) laid out an ascending channel pattern. An ascending channel is the price action contained between upward-sloping parallel lines. Higher highs and higher lows characterize this price pattern. An ascending channel is used to show an uptrend in a security\u2019s price. Ascending channels are short-term bullish in that a stock moves higher within an ascending channel, but these patterns often form within longer-term downtrends as continuation patterns.\n\nAt the time of analysis, the price of Ethereum (ETH) was recorded at $3,770.93. If the pattern trend continues, then the price of ETH might reach the resistance levels of $3734.35, and $6167.80. If the trend reverses, then the price of ETH may fall to the support of $2271.93, and $1540.71.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Resistance and Support Levels\n\nThe chart given below elucidates the possible resistance and support levels of Ethereum (ETH) in 2024.\n\nETH/USDT Resistance and Support Levels (Source: TradingView)\n\nFrom the above chart, we can analyze and identify the following as resistance and support levels of Ethereum (ETH) for 2024.\n\nETH Resistance & Support Levels\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024 \u2014 RVOL, MA, and RSI\n\nThe technical analysis indicators such as Relative Volume (RVOL), Moving Average (MA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) of (ETH) are shown in the chart below.\n\nETH/USDT RVOL, MA, RSI (Source: TradingView)\n\nFrom the readings on the chart above, we can make the following inferences regarding the current Ethereum (ETH) market in 2024.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024 \u2014 ADX, RVI\n\nIn the below chart, we analyze the strength and volatility of Ethereum (ETH) using the following technical analysis indicators \u2014 Average Directional Index (ADX) and Relative Volatility Index (RVI).\n\nETH/USDT ADX, RVI (Source: TradingView)\n\nFrom the readings on the chart above, we can make the following inferences regarding the price momentum of Ethereum (ETH).\n\nComparison of ETH with BTC\n\nLet us now compare the price movements of Ethereum (ETH) with that of Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBTC Vs ETH Price Comparison (Source: TradingView)\n\nFrom the above chart, we can interpret that the price action of ETH is similar to that of BTC. That is, when the price of BTC increases or decreases, the price of ETH also increases or decreases respectively.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 \u2013 2030\n\nWith the help of the aforementioned technical analysis indicators and trend patterns, let us predict the price of Ethereum (ETH) between 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, and 2030.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf Ethereum (ETH) establishes itself as a good investment in 2024, this year would be favorable to the cryptocurrency. In conclusion, the bullish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for 2024 is $5835.81. Comparatively, if unfavorable sentiment is triggered, the bearish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction for 2024 is $2721.19.\n\nIf the market momentum and investors\u2019 sentiment positively elevate, then Ethereum (ETH) might hit $6000. Furthermore, with future upgrades and advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem, ETH might surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $4891.70. and mark its new ATH.\n\nThis content was originally published by our partners at The News Crypto."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Prediction After Bitcoin Halving 2024 - CoinCodex",
        "content": "Ethereum is comfortably positioned as the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, and it looks like ETH will only solidify its spot over time. Of course, the most important crypto event in the next year will be Bitcoin halving, and it\u2019s expected to have a significant impact on the markets for all cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll share our Ethereum price prediction after the halving, and explore whether Ethereum is likely to be a good long-term investment or not. First, let\u2019s take a look at how Ethereum has performed during previous Bitcoin halvings.\n\nKey takeaways: Historical trends show Ethereum's varied performance around Bitcoin halvings, with notable differences between the second and third halvings.\n\nSpeculating on Ethereum's price after the fourth Bitcoin halving in 2024 remains uncertain. While Bitcoin halvings generally create a bullish sentiment, their specific impact on Ethereum's price is unpredictable.\n\nOur projections suggest a potential price dip for Ethereum to around $3,900 by April 2024, 25% below its all-time high but a significant 75% rise from its current value.\n\nLonger-term forecasts indicate a surge to over $6,300 by late July 2024, followed by a dip to $3,700 before rallying to peak above $7,300 in March 2025.\n\nEthereum's long-term potential as an investment looks promising due to the Ethereum triple halving concept. Factors such as reduced ETH issuance, EIP-1559's ETH burning, and staking contribute to deflationary pressure on its supply.\n\nHow has Ethereum performed before and after Bitcoin halvings?\n\nFirst off, we need to keep in mind that Ethereum didn\u2019t even exist yet when the first Bitcoin halving happened back in 2012. ETH has only been around for two Bitcoin halvings, so the sample size of Ethereum\u2019s price action before and after Bitcoin halvings is extremely small.\n\nDate ETH Price 1M before Halv. ETH Price at Halv. ETH Price 1M after Halv. ETH Price 3M after Halv. 2nd BTC Halving Jul 9, 2016 $14.7 $11 $11.7 (+6.3%) $11.2 (+1.8%) 3rd BTC Halving May 11, 2020 $160 $211 $249 (+18%) $398 (+88.6%)\n\nBrackets show ETH performance relative to the BTC price at the time of each respective halving.\n\nAs we can see, the ETH price action around Bitcoin halvings has been quite different if we compare ETH\u2019s performance amidst the second Bitcoin halving and its performance amidst the third Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe Ether market was relatively quiet during the second Bitcoin halving, which happened in July 2016. In fact, ETH saw a 25% price decline in the month leading up to the second Bitcoin halving. Following the halving, it showed a modest recovery, although ETH\u2019s price three months after the halving was only about 1.8% higher than it was at the time of the halving.\n\nThe situation amidst the third BTC halving in May 2020 was much more favorable for Ethereum. ETH increased by 31.8% in the month leading up to the third halving. Three months after the halving, Ether was up a whopping 88.6% compared to its price at the time of the halving.\n\nBased on this, it\u2019s difficult to tell what will happen to the Ethereum price as the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches. Generally, Bitcoin halvings are seen as bullish events and improve the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. So, it might be worth considering increasing your ETH stack a bit before the halving.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum price prediction after the Bitcoin halving in 2024-2025?\n\nCurrently, most estimates are suggesting that we should expect the next Bitcoin halving to happen in mid-April 2024. At the moment, the Ethereum price prediction on CoinCodex is forecasting Ethereum to trade at roughly $3,660 on April 15, 2024. This would be about -24.7% below Ethereum\u2019s current all-time high but a 24.9% increase compared to the Ethereum price at the time of writing.\n\nAs far as the Ethereum price prediction for 2024 and 2025 is concerned, the forecast is expecting the ETH price to accelerate sharply soon after the Bitcoin halving, hitting new all-time highs just above $6,600 in September of 2024.\n\nThe prediction is expecting that ETH will then drop and find support at roughly $4,070, before gathering momentum for a new rally that\u2019s forecasted to reach its peak above $7,000 in April 2025.\n\nIs Ethereum a good long-term buy?\n\nEthereum appears to be quite promising as a long-term buy thanks to a concept known as the Ethereum triple halving. Even though the Ethereum protocol does not have a halving mechanism, it does have features that provide deflationary pressure to its supply:\n\nReduced ETH issuance under Proof-of-Stake consensus\n\nETH burning via the EIP-1559 upgrade\n\nEthereum staking lowers the amount of ETH that is effectively in circulation\n\nThese three factors have already contributed to reducing the ETH supply, and will continue to make ETH deflationary so long as demand for transacting on the Ethereum market remains high. Based on Ethereum\u2019s current trajectory and status as the undisputed king of the smart contracts space, the future is looking bright for ETH holders.\n\nEver since Ethereum moved from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, ETH has turned deflationary. Since the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the ETH supply has been dropping by 0.23% per year on average. In that time period, 1.08 million ETH has been issued, while 1.49 million coins have been burned.\n\nETH issuance and burns since the Ethereum network transitioned to Proof-of-Stake. Image source: ultrasound.money\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that it's not guaranteed that ETH will remain deflationary forever. This is because the EIP-1559 mechanism burns the base ETH transaction fees paid by users. This means that the amount of ETH that's being burned depends on the demand for transactions on the Ethereum network. If demand for transactions saw a significant drop, it's possible that ETH could become inflationary again at some point in the future.\n\nAnother way to get a unique perspective on the Ethereum price from a long-term perspective is the Ethereum rainbow chart. This chart uses a concept known as logarithmic regression and features 9 different colored bands. Depending on which band the Ethereum price currently resides in, it can be interpreted as signaling overbought, underbought, or neutral conditions.\n\nIn the video below, you can learn more about the Ethereum rainbow chart and how you can use it to gauge the current conditions in the Ethereum market, as well as its long-term prospects.\n\nThe possibility of an Ethereum ETF\n\nIn January of 2024, the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by securities regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enter the U.S. market. Before that, the only Bitcoin ETFs which were allowed were Bitcoin futures ETFs, which held Bitcoin futures contract and not actual Bitcoin.\n\nThe logical next step for crypto investing products in the U.S. seem to be ETFs that would allow investor to easily gain access to Ethereum, which is the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization. Several asset management companies including the likes of Franklin Templeton and VanEck have already applied to list spot Ethereum ETFs, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has said that he sees value in an Ethereum ETF.\n\nTo be sure, it might take a long time for the SEC to approve spot Ethereum ETFs \u2013 after all, getting the first spot Bitcoin ETFs was a multi-year effort even though several large asset management firms were pushing to get these products on the market. Still, the narrative that an Ethereum ETF is likely to come in the future will likely serve as a tailwind for ETH.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade\n\nAnother bullish factor for Ethereum is the Dencun upgrade, which will introduce several EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). The most notable EIP that will be included in the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, also dubbed \"Proto-Danksharding\".\n\nEIP-4844 aims to significantly improve performance for applications that depend on the use of extensive datasets, such as decentralized applications (dApps) and layer-2 scaling solutions developed on Ethereum. By dividing tasks between the consensus and \"database\" layers, the upgrade is an important step towards the ultimate goal of completely fragmenting the Ethereum blockchain into shards to achieve massive scalability.\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun upgrade will also introduce other EIPs such as EIP-6780, EIP-5656 and EIP-1153.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSo far, there hasn\u2019t been a clear trend of how Ethereum tends to perform in anticipation and immediate aftermath of Bitcoin halvings. Of course, Ethereum has only been around for two Bitcoin halvings, so the historical data is very limited. Overall, it might be a good idea to purchase some ETH as the halving approaches since the crypto markets tend to be optimistic in the lead-up to Bitcoin halvings.\n\nETH appears to be positioned well over the long term, thanks to its tokenomics. After transitioning to Proof-of-Stake, the protocol needs to issue much fewer new ETH coins, and EIP-1559 is constantly burning the ETH that\u2019s being spent to pay for transaction fees.

        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC) recorded a new all-time high (ATH), Ethereum (ETH) rallied above $3,800 before the price crashed over 10%. The second-largest cryptocurrency has recovered from the dip and reached $3,900 momentarily for the first time in over two years.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation Is Selling ETH Again, Is The Top In? 6 months ago\n\nEthereum Recovers And Rallies to $3,900\n\nOn Thursday, Bitcoin reached a crucial milestone after breaking above $69,000 and recording a new all-time high (ATH). Before the euphoria was over, the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s price started to drop, trading as low as $60,000. Since then, BTC\u2019s price has recovered to hover between the $66,000-$67,000 price range.\n\nFueled by the bullish sentiment, Ethereum rallied above $3,800 before suffering a considerable price drop. The \u2018king of altcoins\u2019 lost momentum and shredded about 12% of its price to trade at a price as low as $3,360, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAfter the dip was done, ETH started to show a recovery alongside Bitcoin. As reported by NewsBTC, a crucial resistance level to clear during this recovery was $3,600. Ethereum surpassed this support level and has maintained its price above the $3,800 range during the last 4 hours.\n\nEthereum reached the $3,800 support level twice in the last 24 hours. This price range was not seen since January 2022, and the regained bullish momentum propelled the token\u2019s price to a higher milestone.\n\nEthereum hit $3,900 for the first time since December of 2021. The biggest altcoin briefly soared to $3,901 before falling to the $3,850 price range.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,834, representing a 1.6% price drop in the last hour and a 2% increase from 24 hours ago. Similarly, the token exhibits green numbers on longer timeframes.\n\nETH price performance in the 4-hour chart. Source: ETHUSDT on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum\u2019s price performance has surged almost 16% in the past week, 65% in the last month, and an impressive 145% in one year.\n\nETH\u2019s market capitalization increased 1.55% to $459.7 million on the last day. Its daily trading volume has increased by 58%, with $52.16 billion in market activity in the previous 24 hours.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH\u2019s Price?\n\nMany analysts have forecasted that ETH\u2019s rally is far from over. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa predicted that Ethereum could reach $4,000 when it breaks through the $3,000 price barrier.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rally seems to be fueled not only by Bitcoin\u2019s momentum but also by the general market dynamics. The date for the Dencun upgrade is approaching, and this update is expected to bring several technical improvements to Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure,\n\nMoreover, the possibility of Ether-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) being approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May has built expectations for Ether and the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nPseudonym trader Ash Crypto suggested to his Telegram subscribers that the price correction experienced after Bitcoin\u2019s new ATH was not a \u201creason to panic.\u201d\n\nMessage from Ash Crypto to his Telegram Subscribers.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEthereum has recently seen a remarkable price surge, surpassing the $3900 mark. This surge comes after a period of retesting at the support level, showcasing Ethereum\u2019s strength amidst market fluctuations. With a 70% increase in value, Ethereum\u2019s recent performance signifies a significant shift in market sentiment and heightened investor confidence.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dominance and Independent Trajectory\n\nOne notable trend in Ethereum\u2019s recent performance is its divergence from Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. While Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum\u2019s surge beyond $3900 showcases its ability to chart an independent course, unaffected by Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuations.\n\nThis divergence emphasizes Ethereum\u2019s unique value proposition and its increasing significance as a standalone digital asset.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s crash after reaching its new ATH past $69K resulted in the whole market tumble, Ethereum\u2019s stronghold is now garnering global market attention.\n\nEthereum\u2019s recent growth chart shows its increasing potential. With substantial percentage increases in trading value, Ethereum has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors, driving demand and fueling further growth.\n\nAlso Read: South Korea Kimchi Premium Hits 2-Year High \u2013 Leverage SBF To Make $Million A Day\n\nThe Crossroads: US Federal Reserve\u2019s BTFP Closure\n\nAs the US Federal Reserve\u2019s Financial Banknote Investment Plan (BTFP) approaches its conclusion on March 11, 2024, Ethereum stands at a crucial juncture. The BTFP, instituted in March 2023, has provided liquidity to US banks during turbulent times. The closure may impact traditional banks, causing liquidity constraints, but the Federal Reserve could adopt a more lenient policy, potentially benefiting Ethereum and the broader market.\n\nArthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, predicts a turbulent March with the possibility of a 30-40% correction in Bitcoin prices triggered by the BTFP\u2019s expiry. Despite the anticipated correction, he remains optimistic about a potential rebound before the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on March 20.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase, has pointed out the synchronicity of crucial events, including the BTFP\u2019s expiration, Bitcoin\u2019s halving in April, and the RRP running out in May. These events converge, presenting unique circumstances that could amplify market reactions.\n\nAs Ethereum experiences a surge, the broader cryptocurrency market faces a pivotal moment with the closure of the BTFP. Ethereum\u2019s independent trajectory and growing market significance add complexity to market dynamics. Investors are advised to navigate this period with caution, considering the potential impact of macroeconomic indicators on Ethereum\u2019s valuation."

        "content": "The Ethereum liquidity staking protocol Rocket Pool is on the brink of a massive transformation with the incoming Dencun upgrade. As one community advocate points out, this change is primarily due to the enhancements the Houston upgrade will tag.\n\n\n\nEyes On Dencun Upgrade\n\nIn a recent post on X, the advocate explained that the Dencun upgrade, scheduled to go live in mid-March 2024, will pave the way for the implementation of the Houston upgrade. The Houston upgrade, in turn, aims to improve Rocket Pool\u2019s scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade must first be successfully implemented so that the Houston enhancements can take effect and improve Rocket Pool\u2019s performance.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nThis hard fork update requires all Ethereum node operators to upgrade their software. Once the network is updated, developers predict that transaction costs, particularly in layer-2 networks, will decrease significantly.\n\nEIP-4788 And Why It Is Crucial For Rocket Pool\n\nHowever, the Dencun upgrade will also execute a crucial enhancement, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4788. This proposal is designed to optimize communication between the execution layer, where all smart contracts and transactions occur, and the consensus layer, which includes validators like Rocket Pool.\n\nA crucial aspect of this proposal is enabling the execution layer to access consensus layer information without needing third-party oracles, thereby enhancing the mainnet\u2019s security and efficiency.\n\nWith the activation of the Houston upgrade, Rocket Pool users can anticipate a series of enhancements designed to improve their experience.\n\nOnce Houston goes live, the protocol will automatically lower the minimum ETH staking amount, allowing more users to stake. Additionally, introducing a delegated mini-pool contract will streamline the distribution of fees and rewards. In Rocket Pool, a mini pool is a virtual pool combining all the ETH from stakers.\n\nHowever, over time, the activation of EIP-4788 allows Rocket Pool to innovate on ETH staking. Looking at the price chart, this expectation has been well received.\n\nSo far, RPL, the native token of the liquidity staking platform, has been ripping higher. On March 6, the token broke above February highs above $33. Traders expect bulls to build on recent gains, pushing the token towards January 2024 highs of around $40.\n\nRelated Reading\n\n14-Year Old Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Wakes Up To Crash BTC Price 6 months ago\n\nWhen written on March 7, the token was up nearly 110% from its October 2023 lows.

The tokens that EigenLayer currently supports include Lido\u2019s stETH, RocketPool\u2019s rETH, Coinbase\u2019s cbETH, Stakewise\u2019s sETH, Mantle\u2019s mETH, Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, Ankr\u2019s ankrETH and Binance\u2019s wBETH, to name a few.\n\nEigenLayer is the pioneer in restaking, a trend that has emerged since earlier this year. Simply put, restaking is repurposed staked ETH and Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking tokens across Ethereum and other platforms to enhance security.\n\nIn February, EigenLayer announced that it had successfully raised $100 million in a series B round from a16z fund. Previously, in March 2023, the protocol reportedly secured $50 million from Blockchain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital and many other funds.\n\nEigenLayer hasn\u2019t issued tokens yet, but the team\u2019s leaders told Bloomberg they are open to token issuance.\n\nAs EigenLayer gains traction, projects associated with it, such as Ether.Fi, Kelp DAO and Puffer Finance, also experience growth. Kelp DAO recently airdropped EigenLayer users based on reward points measured by protocol activities. Ether.Fi announced today that it partners with Omni Network in a $600 million deal to boost the security of EigenLayer\u2019s restaking model.\n\nEthereum-powered Protocols Set to Benefit from Dencun Upgrade\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade is set to go live on March 13. This will be one of the largest upgrade following the Shanghai upgrade last year. The Dencun upgrade is expected to bring several key improvements that will not onlyl benefit Ethereum but also the projects built on top of it, particularly liquid staking, restaking, and cross-chain protocols.\n\nTwo major highlights of the Dencun upgrade is the EIP-4788 and EIP-4844, aimed at reducing risks while enhancing security for dApps. Apart from the security aspect, these proposals also target fee reduction on layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum and Optimism, potentially driving more users to engage with the blockchains.\n\nLiquid staking protocols, like Lido Finance and Rocket Pool, are among the names that could take advantage of the Dencun upgrade. Over the last year, the liquid staking segment has increasingly attracted large-scale adoption, with the potential to reach billions of dollars in value.\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) of projects in this segment, as seen in DefiLlama\u2019s report, increased by 300% last year.\n\nLiquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool, SSV and Stader have become familiar names to investors in the industry since Ethereum successfully deployed The Merge, switching from Proof-of-Work to Proof- of-Stake and then proceeded to unlock staked ETH after the Shanghai upgrade in April 2023. This movement potentially continues after Dencun.\n\nAnother group that can benefit from the Dencun upgrade are staking projects, with common names being EigenLayer, Swell, Ether.Fi and Kelp DAO.\n\nAs a result, a wave of new DeFi derivatives products have come, allowing users to reuse their staked assets. For example, Lybra Finance and Prisma Finance are currently offering yields to ETH depositors, while veterans like Abracadabra are showing signs of entering liquid staking.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, Ethereum (ETH) is nearing $3,600 amid Bitcoin\u2019s price rally earlier today. At press time, ETH is trading at around $3,560, up around 2% in the last 24 hours."

The increase suggests a growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum.\n\n\n\nLayer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum are experiencing exponential growth, reflected in the total locked value (TVL), which exceeds $36.7 billion. This value represents the amount of assets staked or deposited on leading platforms like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base.\n\nIn particular, Arbitrum One, one of the first Layer 2 solutions for ETH, has emerged as a leader with a TVL of $15.7 billion, almost double that of its closest competitor, Optimism. This dominance is attributed to its advantage as a pioneer in the market and its perceived greater security.\n\nThe growth in TVL suggests a growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network, especially amid rising cryptocurrency prices and ETH in particular. This increase in adoption and use of Layer 2 platforms reflects the search for solutions to scalability and cost issues on the Ethereum network.\n\nIn addition to the value of ETH, other assets have also experienced significant growth. For example, native tokens like ARB and OP, associated with Arbitrum and Optimism respectively, have seen increases in their value and market capitalization in recent weeks. An indicator of the growing interest in these platforms and their associated projects.\n\nEthereum Will Leap in Efficiency and Cost Reduction with the Arrival of Dencun\n\nThe preference for Layer 2 solutions is due to their greater scalability and lower fees compared to direct transactions on the main ETH network. Additionally, these platforms offer a level of security derived from Ethereum, increasing the confidence of users and protocols that use them.\n\nThese solutions are playing a crucial role in the expansion and continuous development of the network, opening up new possibilities and opportunities for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and transactions on the ETH blockchain.\n\nWith the upcoming hard fork Dencun, transaction fees are expected to be even lower and network efficiency to improve, paving the way for greater adoption and growth in the Layer 2 space."

        "title": "Blast- Launch Brings Billions in Staked Crypto to Ethereum\u2019s L2 - News Welcome",
        "content": "The recent launch of Blast\u2019s Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) mainnet has generated considerable interest in the cryptocurrency space. This development offers users faster and cheaper transactions on the Ethereum network while unlocking billions of dollars in previously locked-up crypto. However, the launch has not been without controversy, and it has raised questions about the project\u2019s approach and sustainability.\n\nA Treasure Trove of Crypto Opens\n\nBlast\u2019s mainnet launch marked a significant milestone for the project. Over 180,000 users gained access to and could potentially withdraw approximately $2.3 billion worth of crypto previously locked on the network. These funds were initially deposited during the Early Access phase, where users earned yields on their holdings, likely reaching a combined sum of $85 million annually. This attractive yield system, combined with features like auto-rebasing and staking, aimed to attract users looking for opportunities to grow their crypto portfolios.\n\nControversy Surrounds the Launch\n\nDespite the potential benefits, Blast\u2019s launch has faced significant criticism on multiple fronts. One major point of contention revolves around the pre-launch bridge. Critics argued that launching the bridge before the L2 itself was operational created a situation where users could not withdraw funds for several months. This may likely set a negative precedent for other projects and raise concerns about user protection and flexibility.\n\nAdditionally, some found Blast\u2019s marketing tactics to be exaggerated and misleading, which may be undermining the project\u2019s credibility and creating distrust amongst potential users. To further add fuel to the fire, a venture capital firm involved in Blast\u2019s funding publicly disagreed with the launch strategy and marketing approach and highlighted concerns about the project\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nAddressing Concerns and Building Trust\n\nBlast\u2019s team has taken steps to address some of the criticism. They have reiterated their commitment to transparency and open communication, acknowledged the concerns raised, and offered explanations to alleviate user anxieties. The team has also explained the origin of the yields offered, stressing their reliance on established and trusted protocols like Lido and MakerDAO to ensure the sustainability of these returns. While some users have chosen to withdraw their funds, others remain invested in the network and are likely looking for benefits from the launch of new decentralized applications (Dapps) and the likelihood for airdrops in the future.\n\nConsiderations for the L2 Landscape\n\nBlast enters a competitive landscape that is already occupied by other Ethereum L2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. Its unique incentive model, similar to the one employed by the founder\u2019s previous successful venture, has generated significant interest. However, the project needs to address concerns, build trust, and establish long-term sustainability to ensure successful user adoption and carve out a niche in the ever-evolving L2 ecosystem.\n\nMoving forward, the success of Blast\u2019s L2 network will depend on its ability to cater to a myriad of factors: user expectations, investor scrutiny, and fierce competition within the Ethereum scaling solutions sphere. Only time will tell if Blast can overcome the initial hurdles, build trust, and establish its position as a viable contender in this rapidly evolving technological frontier."
