        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."

Discover SCENE\n\nEthereum (ETH) touched $3,000 for the first time since April 2022, just before the entire crypto market entered a brutal bear market.\n\nThe price of ETH stands at $3,000, according to CoinMarketCap data, representing a more than 3.4% 24-hour rise. Over the past week, it has risen by 13%.\n\nThe last time the second-largest cryptocurrency stood at the $3,000 mark was nearly 22 months ago. One month later, the crypto project Terra collapsed, bringing the price of every digital coin and token with it. ETH has struggled to recover since then.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA lot is now happening in the Ethereum world today, however, and there is more interest in the asset than before. A number of high-profile Wall Street fund managers have proposed spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIf approved, traditional investors would have access to ETH in a safe and regulated way. The likes of BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck are hoping to get the green light from the regulator.\n\nLast month, British multinational bank Standard Chartered projected that a spot ETH ETF will likely get approved by May\u2014and then it'll only go up in price.\n\nETH's network is also about to undergo a vital upgrade, dubbed \"Dencun.\" The improvement will bring \"proto-danksharding\" to the blockchain, promising to make it faster and cheaper to use.\n\nETH is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "The potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, which includes plans for staking, might amplify concentration risks within the Ethereum network, S&P Global Ratings highlighted in a recent analysis.\n\nAccording to the report, the SEC could approve ETH ETFs as early as May. However, as financial heavyweights vie for a stake in this emerging sector, the entry of ETFs could significantly sway the balance of validator power in Ethereum, posing new challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe SEC has to decide on VanEck\u2019s application by May 23 and could rule on other ETH ETF applications by that deadline.\n\nConcentration risks\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF proposals from Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton aim to generate additional yield by staking ETH. However, if those staking-enabled ETFs see sufficiently high inflows, they could impact participation rates in Ethereum\u2019s validation network, S&P Global analysts wrote.\n\nAccording to the report, Lido currently accounts for a little under one-third of staked ETH and is the largest Ethereum validator. However, the report casts doubt on the likelihood of these ETFs opting for decentralized staking protocols such as Lido.\n\nInstead, a preference for institutional crypto custodians seems more probable, suggesting a different impact on validator concentration depending on the diversification strategies of issuers.\n\nThe report also highlighted that Coinbase \u2014 which serves as a custodian for some funds \u2014 could also pose a concentration risk if it takes in new ETH on behalf of US ETFs.\n\nThe exchange is currently responsible for roughly 15% of staked ETH, making it the second-largest validator overall. It also serves as the custodian for three of the four largest non-US staking Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe report said these issues are critical because reliance on a single entity or software client can introduce risks of validator outages and attacks. It called for greater monitoring of concentration risk and emphasized its importance.\n\nThe emergence of new digital asset custodians could offer a pathway for ETF issuers to distribute their stakes more broadly, which could also mitigate concentration risk.\n\nJP Morgan echoes concerns\n\nS&P Global\u2019s report echoes the concerns raised by JP Morgan regarding concentration risks in the Ethereum staking ecosystem in October 2023. The lender\u2019s report also concluded that the dominance of Lido and Coinbase poses significant concentration risks to the ecosystem.\n\nJP Morgan argued that a concentrated number of validators could become a single point of failure, jeopardizing the network\u2019s stability and security. Such centralization also presents lucrative targets for malicious attacks, ranging from hacking attempts to coordinated disruptions of network operations.\n\nAdditionally, the analysts at JPMorgan cautioned against the potential for collusion among major validators. An oligopoly of validators could manipulate the network\u2019s governance and operational parameters to their advantage at the expense of Ethereum\u2019s broader user base.\n\nThis could manifest in censoring transactions, engaging in preferential treatment of certain operations, or front-running \u2014 practices that would erode trust in Ethereum\u2019s fairness and transparency.\n\nEnsuring that Ethereum remains a robust, secure, and decentralized platform requires a collective effort to mitigate concentration risks and to foster an environment where no single validator or group of validators can wield disproportionate power.\n\n**Editor\u2019s Note: Updated to fix inaccuracies about the JP Morgan report.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "With the Bitcoin ETF dust settled, analysts are now turning to Ethereum.\n\nSeveral key catalysts could see Ether outperform Bitcoin this next cycle.\n\nOnchain activity is already on the rise, specifically for stablecoins built on Ethereum.\n\nThe immensely successful launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the US is setting the stage for a new wave of speculation.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s all eyes on Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has a good chance of approving Ethereum spot ETFs in May, analysts told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s not the second-most valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s only tailwind, either.\n\nSEC\u2019s next ETF hurdle\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs now out of the gate, analysts are turning their attention to Ethereum and its slew of catalysts.\n\nAt the top of the list: The SEC might greenlight a slew of Ethereum spot ETFs in May. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Bitcoin spot ETF issuers have already filed applications to launch such products.\n\n\u201cWhile the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t as much of a guaranteed approval as the Bitcoin ETF, the market has now gotten a taste of what to expect when it is approved,\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told DL News.\n\nOver $10 billion has already flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale\u2019s fund, which already existed prior to its conversion into an ETF. The action has helped buttress Bitcoin\u2019s hefty 21% rally since the year\u2019s start.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cGiven Ethereum\u2019s smaller market cap and liquidity, a similar or lesser amount of flows would have an even bigger impact on Ethereum\u2019s price,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe market will begin to reprice this possibility higher over the next one to two months ahead of more clarity from the SEC.\u201d\n\nBrian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News he saw the odds of Ethereum ETFs being approved at roughly 66%.\n\n\u201cThe experts I\u2019m seeing give May approval odds between sub-50% to 70%,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone, however, thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time, since Ethereum futures-based ETFs exist already \u2014 if denied in May, the SEC will get sued, and approval moves to 2025.\u201d\n\nUsers of the crypto-powered prediction site Polymarket price approval odds at 47%.\n\nThe deadline for approval is May 23, says Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. That\u2019s the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said last year that the agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving a fund ahead of others \u2014 like when it allowed ProShares to launch its Bitcoin futures ETF before anyone else.\n\nDencun, EigenLayer and Ethereum\u2019s burn\n\nEthereum has three other tailwinds, too.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade \u2014 designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 solutions \u2014 is Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade since Shapella, which allowed stakers to finally withdraw their ETH from the network.\n\n\u201cLayer 2s are a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s future success,\u201d CCData research lead Joshua de Vos told DL News. \u201cImproving their scalability and cost-effectiveness is going to enhance the attractiveness of Ethereum compared to competing layer 1s such as Solana.\u201d\n\nThe rise of restaking protocols such as EigenLayer is another reason traders may flock to Ethereum, Rudick pointed out.\n\nAnd stablecoin growth on the network is an indication that activity was ready to pick back up, Thompson argued. Ethereum stablecoin supply is up 4.4% since January 1, from $68 billion to $71 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy may also play to the bulls. Vigorous onchain activity means the network burns even more Ethereum per transaction. If this destruction outpaces issuance \u2014 or how much new Ethereum enters the market \u2014 it can create a deflationary dynamic.\n\nSince February 8, for example, there has already been more Ether destroyed than created, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cIn a bull market where onchain activity is increasing, stablecoin supply growing and user adoption scaling at a higher pace, Ethereum is positioned to outperform Bitcoin given its more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $51,217.\n\nEthereum is trading flat over the same period, now at $2,912.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "It certainly feels like we're in the midst of a crypto correction these days. Among the best asset classes for investment in the early days of the year, many digital coins and tokens have reversed course in recent days by trading lower.\n\nThat trend continued on Wednesday, with top coin Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) down by more than 2% in late afternoon trading and high-profile meme coin Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) sliding at a similar rate. Other altcoins were taking harder hits, including Axie Infinity (CRYPTO: AXS) and Optimism (CRYPTO: OP), which were heading south at a nearly 6% and almost 11% clip, respectively.\n\nA spot of bother\n\nInterestingly, it seems a major factor driving crypto prices skyward recently might be a reason for them sliding now. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to surge in popularity, soaring to multiweek highs in trading action on Tuesday. According to crypto news and analytics site TheBlock.com, the volume of such securities that day reached nearly $2.6 billion.\n\nInvestors like spot Bitcoin ETFs because they provide near-direct exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of having to manage it. This typically involves opening, funding, and maintaining a specialized crypto trading account and handling the often wonky particulars of digital wallet management. With a spot Bitcoin ETF, all an interested investor needs to do is buy shares through a traditional brokerage.\n\nAs a group, cryptos also tend to wane when there's hot action in other types of securities. Wednesday was all about tech stocks -- remember those? Much of the investment world was focused particularly on the latest quarterly report published after market hours Wednesday by graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (spoiler alert; the company did gangbusters in its fourth quarter, beating on both the top and bottom lines).\n\nWith much action in all manner of tech stocks in advance of that earnings release, it's likely that some crypto-holders did a little reallocating by shifting part of their funds from coins/tokens to tech equities.\n\nEthereum should soon get the spot ETF treatment, too\n\nNvidia is likely to stay the investment story for the rest of the week, and those spot Bitcoin ETFs sure aren't going anywhere. Considering that, there's more than a small chance this crypto correction could last for a few more days.\n\nAs usual in market downturns, though, that would open up opportunities for buying on the slump. Personally, I'll be holding on to my (admittedly tiny) Ethereum position, as that coin is almost certain to be the next digital asset getting the spot ETF treatment. Dogecoin is always somewhat of a dodgy investment given its continued lack of utility and its volatility, but utility plays like Optimism could rise along with the coming of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ethereum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ethereum wasn\u2019t one of them.

Markets in general\u2014crypto and securities\u2014closed in the red yesterday while investors cautiously waited for hints at what the U.S. Federal Reserve will decide at its next FOMC meeting.\n\nTomorrow the U.S. will release new data on unemployment claims and January home sales\u2014two criteria that could weigh heavily on the Fed\u2019s upcoming decisions on interest rates. Generally speaking, stocks and digital assets tend to thrive when the Fed lowers rates. And neither crypto nor securities markets like the uncertainty of not knowing what the FOMC will do next.\n\nThe Dow Jones index fell 0.17%, closing at 38,563.80 points; the S&P 500 fell 0.60%, registering 4,975.51 points; and the Nasdaq had a more expressive fall, closing the day at 15,630.78 points, for a decrease of 0.92%.\n\nAnd crypto is mimicking Wall Street. Bitcoin commenced the trading day at $52,272, embarking on a downward trajectory that saw it touch a low of $50,611.

However, it has been trading sideways since February 15, suggesting a potential cooling off of bullish momentum.\n\nA critical support level for Bitcoin is identified around the $51,000 mark, correlating with the EMA 10, or 10-day exponential moving average. Notably, Bitcoin has not closed below this level since January 25.\n\nPresently, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicates Bitcoin is overbought, with a value nearing 70, suggesting a potential shift towards market equilibrium as investors might begin selling BTC to realize profits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum's Response to Market Dynamics\n\nEthereum seems to be mirroring Bitcoin's immediate market response.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization faced rejection at the $3,000 mark, a notable psychological barrier, subsequently retracting by 3.2% to a daily nadir of $2,880. Following this, Ethereum managed a modest recovery to $2,900.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nContrasting with Bitcoin's sideways movement, Ethereum has maintained a bullish stance throughout February, consistently navigating within an upward trajectory.\n\nThis resilience underscores Ethereum's robust market sentiment, marked by fundamental factors that have set high expectations among traders: an upcoming network upgrade, a sustained increase in DeFi activity that\u2019s more than doubled to $45 billion since october 2023, and even rumors of a possible spot Ethereum ETF being approved in the future.\n\nEthereum is presently positioned closer to its support level at $2,800, determined by its 10-day average price, rather than facing immediate resistance. Should Ethereum manage a recovery and sustain its bullish trend, the next significant resistance is anticipated near the $3,500 mark.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

At the time of writing, ether had failed to gain momentum towards a move higher, suggesting that this resistance level won\u2019t be so easy to breach.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this recent rally could also have some traders on their toes, given the last time ether rallied to this level in the weeks leading up to April 3, 2022. At the time, ether rallied from $2,520 over three weeks to a high of $3,580, but its price plummeted 46% over the next 40 days that followed.\n\nIn its most recent review of the crypto market, onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that while Bitcoin dominance still remains significant, there are early signs of more investor capital rotating into other ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cWe note that following the approval of the bitcoin ETF, ether has started to outperform bitcoin, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023,\u201d said the Glassnode analysts.\n\nIt is also likely that major inflows into ether will only materialize over the coming weeks, as they tend to lag relative to bitcoin inflows on account of investors looking for confirmation that digital asset markets are growing.\n\n\u201cIn the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into bitcoin occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ether,\u201d said Glassnode analysts.\n\nOptions market data suggests that a retest of some crucial price levels might come sooner rather than later.

However, an on-chain data trail of funds inflows trickling down to Solana from the Ethereum (ETH) network this week could spark a SOL price rebound toward $150.\n\nSolana price dips 12%, falling below market average\n\nIn the first half of February 2024, Solana was at the forefront of the crypto market rally, with SOL price soaring 26.8% and adding nearly $11 billion to its market capitalization. But that market trend flipped on Feb. 15 as investors began to take profits once the SOL price reached the 2024 peak of $118.\n\nSolana (SOL) price performance vs. Total3 Altcoin Market Cap (Excluding BTC and ETH) | Source: TradingView\n\nAt press time on Feb. 21, Solana is trading at $103, down 12% from its Feb. 15 peaks.\n\nMeanwhile, in contrast, the total altcoin market has grown by 5% during that period. Solana\u2019s negative price performance seems driven by insiders and existing holders\u2019 booking profits rather than macro factors.\n\nSolana receives $25 million in inflows from Ethereum\n\nHowever, while some SOL traders are taking chips off the table, the Solana network has continued to make some giant strides this week, which could trigger an early price rebound.\n\nIn the past week, Solana has received significant inflows from Ethereum as investors increasingly look to leverage Solana\u2019s more efficient and cost-effective defi services.\n\nBetween Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, investors transferred funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum to Solana, per on-chain data from Wormhole bridge Explorer.\n\nFund Outflows Ethereum (ETH) to Solana (SOL), Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 21 | Source: Wormhole Bridge\n\nThis indicates that Solana continues gaining traction among developers and defi users due to its high throughput and low transaction costs.

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Filecoin, and Hedera Are on Fire Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Speculation about cryptocurrency ETFs continues, but a lot is going on under the crypto hood.\n\nThe crypto market's hot streak is continuing, and since the market closed on Friday, there have been some big movers. And in some of these cases, the moves have been driven by real developments, not just hype.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.88%) has risen as much as 8.1% since the stock market closed on Friday, Filecoin (FIL -0.78%) jumped by 40.7%, and Hedera (HBAR -2.34%) was up 38.7%. As of noon ET Tuesday, the tokens were up 5.4%, 30%, and 22.1% since Friday.\n\nBig crypto moves all around\n\nEthereum is rising in part because traders are still speculating that regulators will approve more crypto ETFs beyond the Bitcoin (BTC -0.45%) ETFs launched in the last few months. The next coin that is likely to get approval for one is Ethereum because of its size and recognition in the market.\n\nIf an ETF were approved, the purchasing activity around the coin could push Ethereum higher, in a similar fashion to the way Bitcoin has responded. Just last week, $2.4 billion flowed into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFilecoin's rise was prompted by more fundamental news: It announced it will store Solana's (SOL -0.46%) block history, allowing Solana to move to more decentralized storage. This should be a win for both cryptocurrencies; Solana can now focus more attention on expanding the high-throughput network while Filecoin gets a significant partner.\n\nLesser-known token Hedera is benefiting from the growth in its SaucerSwap decentralized exchange, which now has over $127 million in total locked value, a gauge of how much investors are putting into the exchanges on the ecosystem.\n\nBuilding the foundation of crypto's future\n\nIndividually, these moves may seem small. But together, they tell a story about where crypto is headed in the near future.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have been approved, which suggests that eventually, ETFs for Ethereum and other tokens could arrive too, bringing more money into the ecosystem and driving values higher. If an Ethereum ETF gets approved, there may soon be dozens of crypto ETFs.\n\nThe Filecoin and Hedera news is more useful for the industry long term. As more tokens and exchanges are launched, it's necessary for market makers to put value into the ecosystem, and that's part of what we're seeing with the SaucerSwap exchange. Filecoin helping Solana store its blockchain history moves that token toward the decentralized vision that so many advocates would like to see.\n\nIf Solana and Filecoin can work together to create an extremely fast, high-throughput blockchain with accessible storage, it would be a win for all blockchain users. This is where I think we will see more utility and financial products built in the near future.\n\nCrypto is maturing before our eyes\n\nTwo years ago, crypto was still in the speculative trading days, and speculation in that market still exists, but major tokens like this are now focused on building real utility on blockchains. If that utility is combined with more investors putting money into the crypto ecosystem, it could create a reinforcing loop of value creation."

        "content": "Ethereum\u2019s price surged over 9% in the past week, while Bitcoin was up around 3%.\n\nShare this article\n\nEthereum (ETH) is setting its sights on the $3,000 mark as the Dencun upgrade inches closer. According to data from TradingView, Ethereum\u2019s price has exceeded $2,980 in the last 24 hours, up over 27% year-to-date. This milestone marks Ethereum\u2019s most triumphant return to the $2,900 range since May 2022.\n\nThis surge in Ethereum\u2019s valuation is largely attributed to a confluence of positive market developments and speculative anticipation surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAccording to data from SpotOnChain, a whale has recently amassed a staggering 54,721 ETH, valued at over $150 million, through transactions on Binance and the decentralized exchange 1inch, averaging a purchase price of over $2,845 per ETH.\n\nFurther examination of this whale\u2019s portfolio via the SpotOnChain reveals a current holding of 74,383 ETH, equating to around $216 million. This accumulation signifies a near tripling of their Ethereum holdings in just 24 hours.\n\nIn addition to the ETH holdings, this investor also acquired about 5,485 stETH, liquid staking assets from Lido Finance, valued at nearly $16 million.\n\nLiquid staking on Ethereum has attracted a huge amount of users. The total value locked in the liquid staking protocols has skyrocketed almost 600% since January last year, as reported by DeFiLlama . With the Dencun upgrade underway, liquid staking on Ethereum might see even greater growth in the future.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade will introduce several improvements, including the highly-anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 (EIP-4844), or \u201cProto-Danksharding.\u201d This feature is expected to significantly reduce transaction fees, particularly benefiting layer 2 rollup chains.\n\nApart from the Dencun upgrade, there\u2019s also a lot of hype surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, with prominent asset managers such as BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Franklin Templeton among the eight filing for the investment fund.\n\nMay 23 is a critical date for a potential spot Ethereum ETF as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prepares to rule on VanEck\u2019s application. Interestingly, some developments experienced during the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs are resurfacing, as seen in ARK Invest and VanEck\u2019s recent update to their spot Ethereum ETF filings.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s price rally from around $27,500 to over $46,900 (according to data from CoinGecko) leading up to the decision on its spot ETF, March is shaping up to be a defining month for Ethereum."

        "content": "Ethereum price surged past $3,000 on Feb. 20, eclipsing Bitcoin\u2019s 22% growth; ETH 2.0 staking deposit trends observed this week suggest the gap could widen even further.\n\nThe media frenzy surrounding the Bitcoin ETF approval saw BTC price outperform ETH in the early days of the 2024 market rally. However, this market trend has flipped since the start of February.\n\nAs investors make long-term bets, the bulls may capitalize on the rising ETH 2.0 staking deposits and declining market supply to drive a rally above $4,000.\n\nEthereum surpasses BTC despite record-breaking ETF inflows\n\nBitcoin has dominated media headlines in recent weeks and for good reason. Since the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, BTC has received unprecedented interest from institutional inflows.\n\nAs of Feb. 19, after barely six weeks of trading, the 10 newly-launched ETFs had acquired over 654,000 BTC, worth more than $36 billion. Despite the record-breaking BTC ETF inflows, ETH price performance has managed to skip past BTC.\n\nEthereum (ETH) vs. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Performance | Feb.1 to Feb. 20, 2023 | Source: TradingView\n\nThe historical price chart shows that BTC prices increased 24.2% in February, rising from $41,864 to a monthly peak of $52,985.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH price has delivered a much more impressive showing, with a 33.7% rise from $2,241 to the $3,000 milestone on Feb. 20, the first time since Apr. 26, 2022.\n\nInvestors place long-term bets on Ethereum\n\nThanks to the seamlessly executed Dencun upgrade, Ethereum has received its fair share of media praise.\n\nThe on-chain data trail shows that investors playing the long game, staking coins to front-run gains from an imminent ETH ETF approval, have been pivotal to ETH\u2019s blistering price action, which eclipsed BTC in February.\n\nInvestors have pulled coins worth over $1.5 billion in the past week as they deposited 504,799 ETH into ETH 2.0 staking contracts on Feb. 13 and Feb. 20.\n\nThis saw the total staking deposits on the Proof of Stake (PoS) network rise to 30,064,242 ETH, according to the official data culled from the Beacon chain.\n\nInvestors Deposit 504,799 ETH into Ethereum 2.0 Beacon.chain | Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 20 | Source: BeaconCha.in\n\nDuring a bull market, a significant increase in staking deposits is a positive trend for any PoS network. An increase in staking deposits enhances network security and stability amid rising network activity and signals that most large ETH investors are looking to play the long game despite elevated prices.\n\nA $1.5 billion increase in ETH staking while prices are trending at a 2-year peak indicates a surge in investor confidence and commitment to the network\u2019s security.\n\nIf this trend persists, the drop-off in market supply amid soaring market demand could see ETH price extend its lead over BTC in the weeks ahead, especially considering that the Bitcoin network lacks a comparable large-scale staking yield incentive.\n\nForecast: Can Ethereum\u2019s price reach $3,500?\n\nDrawing data-driven insights from market trends, ETH price appears primed for further upswing toward $3,500 in the weeks ahead.\n\nHowever, historical accumulation trends suggest that ETH faces stiff resistance at the $3,200 territory.\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s global in/out of the money (GIOM) data groups all existing ETH investors by their entry prices. The GIOM shows that 12.9 million existing holders had acquired 4.74 million ETH at the minimum price of $3,212.\n\nHowever, considering this is the largest cluster of holders that bought ETH above the current prices, a decisive breakout above $3,200 could effectively open the door to a larger upswing towards the $3,500 mark, as predicted.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Forecast, February 2024 | Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThe bears could still invalidate this lofty prediction if the price tumbles below $2,500. Still, in this scenario, the 5.2 million addresses that acquired 4.1 million ETH at the minimum price of $2,548 could mount a significant buy-wall."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn Ethereum (ETH) whale has reportedly made a colossal investment, acquiring $166 million worth of ETH within just three days. According to a recent update from Spot On Chain, the anonymous investor has been actively purchasing large amounts of ETH, leveraging major platforms such as Binance and 1inch for their transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe details shared by Spot On Chain highlight that the whale's latest acquisition involved a hefty sum of 10.01 million USDT to purchase 3,413 ETH at an approximate rate of $2,933 per ETH around nine hours ago. This recent purchase is part of a larger buying spree, where the investor has cumulatively bought 58,134 ETH at an average price of around $2,850 per ETH in the past three days.\n\nThis giant whale spent another 10.01M $USDT to buy 3,413 $ETH at $2,933 ~9hrs ago.\n\n\n\nOverall, the whale has allegedly bought 58,134 $ETH via #Binance and #1icnh at ~$2,850 ($166M) in the past 3 days.\n\n\n\nThe whale still has 19.89M $USDT and may swap them for more $ETH!\n\n\n\nWhat will the\u2026 https://t.co/t2BYgtewmw pic.twitter.com/BzUAI5ja4e \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 21, 2024\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community buzzes with speculation and intrigue, the whale's remaining balance of 19.89 million USDT suggests that this might not be the end of their market activities. There is a high possibility that they may continue to swap this remaining balance for more Ethereum, further influencing the market dynamics.\n\nEthereum price eyes further gains\n\nThe impact of such substantial transactions is not to be underestimated. The current market price of Ethereum stands at $2,919, showing a modest increase of 0.14% over the last 24 hours. More notably, ETH has seen a significant surge of 17.94% in the last 30 days, reflecting renewed interest and optimism in the cryptocurrency. Moreover, the Ethereum market is witnessing an overall uptick in activity.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume for ETH has seen a substantial rise of 45.18%, now standing at $21.21 billion. This heightened activity suggests a robust and engaging market environment for Ethereum. Further insights from CoinGlass reveal an increase in the Open Interest in Ethereum by 1.02% over the last day, totaling $10.58 billion."

        "content": "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today. The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXRP's recent price trajectory has been met with a stark rejection, as it encountered a near-impenetrable resistance level that has halted its upward momentum. This resistance confluence is particularly formidable as it aligns with the 100, 50 and 200 EMAs, key technical indicators closely monitored by traders for significant price movements.\n\nThe current price level has proven to be a substantial barrier for XRP, as the EMAs have converged to form a tight band of resistance. This band has effectively capped the price, acting as a ceiling that XRP has struggled to breach. The close proximity of these EMAs indicates a critical decision point for the asset; a break above could signal a strong bullish turn, while continued rejection may cement the current level as a robust ceiling.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the noticeable lack of trading volume. Volume acts as fuel for price movements, with higher volumes often associated with strong price action. The tepid volume accompanying XRP's approach to this resistance suggests a lack of conviction among buyers, which can often precede a price retreat.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the resistance zone around $0.58 to $0.60 is the area of interest. XRP's recent approach to this level was met with swift denial, indicating that overcoming this barrier will require a significant influx of buyer interest and volume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the support side, the $0.50 level is one to watch. It has served as a historical psychological and technical support level, providing a foundation for price rebounds in the past. Should XRP retreat, the response of buyers at this level could determine the asset's short-term fate.\n\nEthereum almost there\n\nEthereum is on the cusp of breaching the pivotal $3,000 mark, showcasing formidable strength in an otherwise tepid market. Its resilience and upward momentum may well act as a catalyst for broader market optimism.\n\nThe ascent toward $3,000 has been marked by consistent higher lows and higher highs, a bullish pattern that suggests strong buying interest at every dip. Technical indicators have turned favorable, with Ethereum recently pushing past the 50-day and 100-day EMAs \u2014 a sign that the momentum could sustain.\n\nSupport levels for ETH have been notably robust. The primary support at the $2,750 mark, which aligns with the 50-day EMA, has been defended well by the bulls. This level is critical as it has been tested multiple times, proving to be a springboard for subsequent rallies. On the upside, the psychological and technical barrier of $3,000 stands as the next significant challenge. A decisive close above this level could open the gates for further exploration into uncharted price territories, with potential intermediate resistance at $3,200.\n\nETH's exceptional performance can be partly attributed to the ongoing development within its ecosystem. The introduction of ERC-404, a new token standard that combines the versatility of NFTs with the fungibility of standard tokens, is an innovation that could further solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform for decentralized applications.\n\nBitcoin faces opposition\n\nExamination of the BTC chart reveals that the asset is experiencing a consolidation phase, which is often a precursor to a trend continuation rather than a sign of stagnation.\n\nCurrently trading above the $50,000 mark, Bitcoin has maintained a steady position near this psychological threshold. The consolidation phase is characterized by a narrowing price range, with Bitcoin oscillating between support and resistance levels that converge over time. This tightening of price movement is often associated with the accumulation of assets by traders and investors, setting the stage for a potential breakout.\n\nThe key support level for Bitcoin lies around the $48,000 area, which aligns with the 50-day EMA. This level has been tested and held firm on several occasions, indicating strong buying interest. On the flip side, the immediate resistance is located near the $53,000 mark. A convincing break above this level could signal a bullish continuation, potentially targeting previous highs or setting new records."

        "content": "Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has reached the US$3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, in what investors and market watchers are calling the arrival of \u201caltcoin season.\u201d\n\nAltcoin season refers to a period when cryptocurrencies experience significant increases in value compared to Bitcoin. This is often characterized by a surge in market interest, investment, and price appreciation of altcoins.\n\nDuring an altcoin season, investors and traders may shift their focus from Bitcoin to altcoins in search of higher returns, driven by speculation, new project developments, or broader market trends.\n\nEther outperformed Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies on Tuesday and briefly traded above US$3,000 before tracing back. It traded at US$2,918 at 1:30 p.m. ET, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEther is up by 10.8% for the week.\n\nThe increase has been attributed to the anticipation of a potential approval for a spot-based Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could attract more traditional and institutional investors.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ether ETF is expected to mirror the success of new Bitcoin ETFs that debuted last month, which have already attracted significant allocations.\n\nIn addition to ETF speculation, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming network upgrade, known as the Dencun upgrade, is also contributing to the positive sentiment.\n\nThe upgrade, scheduled for March 13, aims to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, introducing proto-danksharding to simplify transactions and reduce costs by storing some data off the blockchain. This technical enhancement is expected to speed up transactions."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter an airdrop farming campaign that prompted hopeful recipients to flood Crypto Twitter with tweets, the Portal gaming token finally has a launch date\u2014and it comes with the announcement of a Binance Launchpool campaign that will offer up another way for crypto users to earn a potentially sizable stash of PORTAL.\n\nPORTAL will launch on February 29, according to the Binance Launchpool campaign page, and the crypto exchange will list the token at 10am UTC (or 5am EST). The Launchpool campaign will debut tomorrow, February 22, and offer token staking rewards ahead of the listing.\n\nBinance customers who stake either Binance Coin (BNB) or the FDUSD stablecoin into PORTAL liquidity pools can earn a share of the total rewards pool, which numbers 50 million tokens\u2014that\u2019s 5% of the total PORTAL supply of 1 billion Ethereum-based tokens.\n\nAccording to Binance, the token will debut with a circulating supply of 167,134,615 PORTAL, or about 16.7% of the total supply. However, Binance\u2019s Launchpool campaign is not available to users in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and more. A full list can be found here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPortal has yet to announce details about the actual airdrop distribution following a farming campaign that spanned November and December last year. A Portal representative told Decrypt\u2019s GG that details will be announced before the Binance token listing.\n\nIn pre-market trading on Whales Market, the PORTAL token is commanding bids of $1.02, which puts the total estimated value of the Binance rewards pool at just a hair over $50 million.\n\nWhat is Portal? Billed as a cross-chain crypto gaming platform and token, it\u2019s designed to bridge the gap across various ecosystems, providing one place to play, discover, and transact across popular blockchain games.\n\n\u26a1 Portal x @binance \u26a1 The moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for is nearly here. On Feb 29, 10am UTC, $Portal will officially launch on @binance. This is just the beginning. We\u2019ve got so much to show you about Portal and the products we\u2019ve been building. Get ready! https://t.co/zge4Prs1n1 \u2014 Portal (@Portalcoin) February 21, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Portal\u2019s founding team members and advisors are associated with SuperDuper, the startup behind Ethereum NFT collection Creepz, including Chief Business Officer Dan Keene, who serves the same role at SuperDuper. Advisors Jamie King (ex-Rockstar Games) and Matt Dixon (ex-Electronic Arts) are among those who also advise SuperDuper.\n\nPortal is represented by prominent Hollywood agency WME. Beyond the airdrop farming campaign, the project also held a presale in December that attracted nearly $10 million worth of interest across Ethereum and Solana in just 15 minutes alone.\n\nThe Portal campaign comes right after Binance concluded a Launchpool push for PIXEL, the Ethereum token of the Ronin network game Pixels. PIXEL was listed Monday and generated more than a billion dollars worth of trading volume in less than a day, making it one of the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies in the world that day, per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Key Takeaways Bitcoin has settled at around $52,000 after enjoying a strong start to the month; however, there are signs that the slow return of retail traders eventually may add momentum.\n\nA new research paper has found theoretical attacks on the proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms used in Bitcoin and Ethereum to be \"economically unfeasible.\"\n\nDecentralized crypto exchange Fixedfloat faced criticism related to a hack of the exchange for roughly $26 million worth of bitcoin and ether.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 network Starknet's new token, STRK, achieved a multi-billion-dollar market capitalization after being airdropped to millions of users.\n\nWhat Happened In Crypto Markets Last Week?\n\nAfter breaking the $50,000 threshold earlier this month, bitcoin has stalled at $52,000. Data shows that retail traders are staying on the sidelines for now, but activity related to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has remained at high levels, with spot bitcoin EFT issuer BlackRock on pace to overtake Microstrategy Inc. as the largest holder of bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, a new research paper found that cyber attacks on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) would be \u201ceconomically unfeasible.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Stalls After Scaling $50,000\n\nBitcoin soared past the $52,000 mark last week, marking its highest point in more than two years. Despite this surge, there are indications a slowdown may be looming.\n\nLate last week, Swissblock analysts said the $52,000 level is a significant resistance point, suggesting a temporary retreat may be necessary to sustain the current bullish trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacks on Bitcoin and Ethereum Labeled 'Unfeasible'\n\nA recently published research paper has shed light on the robust security measures in place for Bitcoin and Ethereum, rendering 51% attacks economically impractical.\n\nResearchers found that these attacks aren't feasible due to the significant costs and logistical hurdles involved. These findings underscore a pivotal evolution in the security of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the researchers said.\n\nDecentralized Crypto Exchange Fixedfloat Hacked\n\nElsewhere, it was reported Sunday on social media platform X that decentralized crypto exchange FixedFloat was hacked for $26 million worth of bitcoin and ether. The operators of the exchange have been criticized for not immediately reporting the hack, which took place earlier this month.\n\nWhat To Expect From Crypto Markets This Week\n\nA popular topic of conversation among traders this week is the potential approval of an ETH ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNotably, the latest ETH ETF application from money management firm VanEck doesn't include staking, which is a departure from previous filings from fund managers ARK Invest Management LLC and Franklin Templeton.\n\nAccording to research released Monday by brokerage firm Bernstein, there is a 50% chance that an ETH ETF gets approved by May and it could be \"well-positioned for mainstream institutional adoption\u201d in the crypto market.\n\nSeparately, many analysts are tracking STRK, which is the new native token of Ethereum Layer 2 protocol Starknet.\n\nAfter briefly trading as high as $5, STRK has settled around the $2 mark on CoinMarketCap Tuesday. It temporarily reached a multibillion-dollar market capitalization after being airdropped to millions of users in what's been called the largest such distribution this year."

        "content": "Ethereum price has tested the $3,000 psychological level, a threshold last hit in 2022.\n\nETH could drop 10%, giving sidelined investors another entry before next leg up.\n\nThe bearish thesis will be invalidated if the PoS token records a higher high above the $3,004 peak.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has managed to test a crucial milestone for the first time in months, which is a remarkable show of strength considering Bitcoin (BTC) price has hinted at a fall. This means that Ether has managed to sidestep the BTC cue, causing markets to speculate on whether another alt season is underway.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin with double-digit weekly gains and spike in Open Interest\n\nEthereum tests $3,000 after almost two years\n\nEthereum (ETH) price scrapped the $3,000 psychological level on Tuesday, a level last tested on April 26, 2022, almost two years ago. It comes a day after the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token outperformed BTC with double-digit weekly gains and a spike in Open Interest.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, Ethereum price has slumped 0.78%, causing up to $15.47 million in short positions to be liquidated against $20 million of long positions. The disparity shows that most traders anticipated the surge in Ethereum price and took long positions, only that their take profits were higher such that their margin accounts could no longer support the open positions.\n\nETH liquidations\n\nAs it stands, Ethereum price is suffering the aftermath of an overbought asset, seen with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 70. Traders looking to take new long positions should probably wait as the ETH market is at high risk of a pullback to the south.\n\nSuch a directional bias could provide sidelined or late investors a buying opportunity around the $2,689 support level before the next leg up. This would denote a 10% fall below current levels.\n\nIn a dire case, Ethereum price could slip below the aforementioned level to test the $2,500 level. Or ETH could find support at the $2,388 critical support.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bulls show strength, Ethereum price could reclaim the $3,000 milestone, potentially going as high as to reclaim the $3,004 range high. A decisive candlestick close above this local top on the daily timeframe would invalidate the bearish thesis.\n\nIs an alt season coming?\n\nMeanwhile, speculation has it that the bold move by Ethereum price against BTC\u2019s price consolidation could be the beginning of an alt season.\n\nAlt season is a colloquial term that is used to describe a phase where investing in altcoins provides better returns compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Consequently, the dominance that Bitcoin holds in the market declines, and that of altcoins increases. The alt season indicator from BlockchainCenter is also leaning in favor of a potential altcoin season taking place as opposed to a Bitcoin season.\n\nAlt season index\n\nQuick summary of an alt season in play\n\nFresh capital enters the cryptocurrency ecosystem, effectively flowing into stablecoins, Bitcoin or Ethereum on preference that they are relatively safe: check! Markets rally as a consequence of this capital influx: check! The profit from these ecosystems, along with the new capital, moves into altcoins: in progress This rotation of capital triggers an alt season: possible result!\n\nThe chart above provides a visual representation."

        "content": "Renowned crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has made a bullish prediction for Ethereum, suggesting that it could soar to $4,500.\n\nVan de Poppe believes Ethereum is soaking up Bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum as investment capital shifts to ETH. According to the analyst, this is a \u201cmassive period to be rotating from Bitcoin towards Ethereum.\u201d\n\n#Ethereum is on its way towards $3,800-4,500. pic.twitter.com/TfoBGloBsH \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 19, 2024\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s forecast comes amidst Ethereum\u2019s recent surge in price, which saw a 9% increase in seven days and 17.5% in one month. Ethereum-related cryptocurrencies have experienced notable gains as well, with MATIC and OP surging by 5% and 6%, respectively.\n\nOn Monday, ETH tapped $3K, its highest in nearly two years, signaling a bullish trend. The recent price surge could be attributed to the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC, following the footsteps of Bitcoin.\n\nSome experts, such as Tom Crown (CEO of Crown Analysis), believe the upswing could continue in the following days, predicting ETH\u2019s surge to $3,300 before the end of February.\n\nAnother person who outlined an optimistic scenario is Raoul Pal (co-founder and CEO of Real Vision). Earlier this month, he forecasted that ETH could rise to as high as $20,000 during the next bull cycle, while BTC could hit the astonishing $250,000.\n\nThe X (Twitter) user Altcoin Gordon was also quite bullish, setting a price tag of $11,250 to be reached by the end of the ongoing year.\n\nHowever, Ethereum\u2019s current market strength could be further bolstered by the upcoming Dencun upgrade, or a short-term peak of BTC, according to the analyst.\n\nEthereum Upgrades Could Boost ETH\u2019s Price\n\nThe Dencun upgrade aims to address Ethereum\u2019s limitations in transaction speed and cost. By implementing sharding \u2014a concept involving breaking network data into smaller \u201cshards\u201d\u2014 the upgrade aims to increase the overall computation throughput on the Ethereum network, making it more competitive with faster networks like Solana.\n\nVitalik Buterin underscored the Dencun upgrade as a significant development for Ethereum and its accompanying Layer-2s.\n\nAccording to Buterin, Dencun is a big step towards making Ethereum more \u201crollup-friendly\u201d while enhancing scalability and reducing costs on transactions.\n\nBesides the Dencun upgrade, the integration of Verkle trees on the Ethereum blockchain is expected to streamline Ethereum nodes\u2019 storage needs while maintaining their block validation capabilities, enhancing efficiency and decentralization within the network\n\nMeanwhile, another factor that could increase Ethereum\u2019s price is the approval of a spot in the ETH ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent post titled \"ETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive,\" on the X platform, Fred Krueger, known for his staunch support of Bitcoin, delivered a harsh critique of Ethereum (ETH), highlighting concerning trends and indicating a bleak outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns over ETH's declining user activity\n\nKrueger began by pointing out that despite Ethereum's soaring price, indicative of a robust ecosystem, the actual usage of the Ethereum blockchain has witnessed a notable decline. He highlighted that while ETH has surged to $3,000, the number of Daily Active Users (DAUs) on the Ethereum network has dwindled from 120,000 in 2021 to a mere 66,000 in the past year.\n\nThe decline in active users is further exemplified by the dwindling numbers on Uniswap V3, Ethereum's leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. With just 16,000 DAUs, a stark contrast to the 60,000-plus seen in 2020, Krueger noted that Ethereum's utility as a transactional platform seems to be eroding.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right?\n\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n\nEth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\nThis statistic is particularly alarming considering Ethereum's role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and its aspirations to become the backbone of various decentralized applications (dApps), especially in the face of the upcoming Dencun Upgrade.\n\nEthereum: Meme coin in disguise?\n\nKrueger likened Ethereum's current state to that of a \"meme coin,\" drawing parallels to assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB). He emphasized that despite its soaring valuation, Ethereum's utility seems to have dwindled, particularly in comparison to other blockchain networks such as Solana, Avalanche and Near, which offer cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism regarding the possibility of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval, citing concerns about regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), unlikely to greenlight an Ethereum ETF due to potential issues surrounding its premined nature, Krueger cautioned against banking on such an approval as a catalyst for Ethereum's growth."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the cryptocurrency market is abuzz with speculation following a series of large transactions linked to a wallet suspected to be associated with Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. According to a tweet from Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, the wallet in question has made a substantial investment in Ethereum (ETH), purchasing a total of 91,316 ETH, amounting to approximately $259.1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sequence of transactions began with a hefty deposit of 90 million USDT (Tether) to popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Following this, the whale wallet, identified by its address \"0x7a95,\" made a significant withdrawal from Binance, taking out 10,136 ETH ($29.76 million) and 40 million USDT. The movement of such large amounts of cryptocurrency has led to widespread speculation about the wallet's owner and their intentions.\n\nJustin Sun's flurry of activity\n\nIf Justin Sun is indeed behind these transactions, this could indicate a growing interest in Ethereum, one of the leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This move is particularly notable given Sun's prominence in the cryptocurrency community and his role as the founder of Tron, a blockchain-based platform that has often been seen as a competitor to Ethereum.\n\nThe current market price of Ethereum stands at $2,916, reflecting a slight increase of 0.17% over the last 24 hours. Moreover, Ethereum has seen a significant uptick in value over the last 30 days, with a 17.65% increase. The trading volume for Ethereum has also surged, with a 42.21% increase in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to $21,589,232,513.\n\nThis flurry of activity comes on the heels of another headline-grabbing move by Justin Sun, who was recently involved in a massive $500 million transfer. The transaction saw a staggering $642.06 million in USDT transferred to JustLend, a decentralized lending platform. While the source of this transaction remains undisclosed, it is widely suspected to be linked to Sun.\n\nThe implications of these developments are manifold. For one, they underscore the growing interconnections between major players in the cryptocurrency sector and the broader market dynamics. Additionally, such substantial investments in Ethereum by a figure like Justin Sun could signal a shift in market sentiment or strategic positioning within the crypto industry."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGaming tokens have spiked in recent days, but not all of them have been able to sustain the upswing. Case in point: MAVIA, the recently launched token of mobile strategy game Heroes of Mavia, has plunged sharply over the last two days, even after setting a new all-time high price.\n\nMAVIA is down over 5% on the day to a price of about $8.00, according to data from CoinGecko, and the latest drop has accelerated a total 24% dip since the Ethereum token popped to a new peak price of $10.59 on Sunday.\n\nHeroes of Mavia is an iOS and Android base-building strategy game similar to the smash hit Clash of Clans, albeit with planned crypto elements that have yet to be integrated. Skrice Studios\u2019 game will implement the MAVIA token for certain benefits, along with NFT land plots sold long before the game\u2019s January debut.\n\nMAVIA\u2019s latest spike came amid a broader surge for gaming tokens, with those tied to the Xai (XAI) and Beam (BEAM) gaming networks also setting all-time high prices, along with NFT trading card game Parallel (PRIME)\u2014GG\u2019s pick for the 2023 game of the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe upswing came just after Skrice revealed a detailed roadmap for the game, which includes implementing some of those aforementioned crypto elements in the game, adding other gameplay features, and rolling out an additional period of MAVIA staking rewards for NFT land owners. Heroes of Mavia will soon announce an as-yet-unrevealed Ethereum scaling network for implementing such crypto components.\n\nThe recent dip on MAVIA may reflect investors and airdrop recipients cashing in on the massive surge in token price. Even at the current subdued price, MAVIA has jumped 338% in value since debuting at $1.83 just two weeks ago. The token has seen just shy of $99 million in trading volume over the past day\u20148th most among gaming tokens, per CoinGecko.\n\nHeroes of Mavia targeted a sizable audience with its airdrop, offering a token claim to 100,000 early players alongside NFT land owners who had participated in previous staking campaigns. According to Skrice, the game has thus far racked up more than 2 million total downloads, with 278,000 daily active users as of Saturday.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "This Ether staking protocol doubles rewards of dominant Lido to win $1.5bn slice of market - DLNews",
        "content": "Liquid staking protocols are pulling out all the stops to attract deposits.\n\nMantle's liquid staking protocol currently offers an annual Ether staking yield of over 7%, subsidised by the yield on its own staked Ether.\n\nOther liquid staking protocols are taking different approaches.\n\nIn the competitive sector of Ether liquid staking, it\u2019s difficult for newer entrants to stand out.\n\nFor the past three years, Lido, the leading liquid staking protocol with over $29 billion of deposits, has dominated the sector. As one of the first liquid staking protocols on the market, Lido is established and battle-tested.\n\nIts liquid staking token \u2014 stETH \u2014 is also the most traded liquid staking token on decentralised exchanges.\n\nIn an attempt to chip away at Lido\u2019s dominance, smaller players are coming up with new ways to lure in investors.\n\nOne such project is Mantle Network, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain that has also launched its own liquid staking protocol. It advertises an annual Ether staking yield of over 7% \u2014 almost double the 3.8% Lido offers.\n\nBut to achieve the high yield, Mantle subsidises staking rewards using the staked Ether in its own treasury. This means Mantle is giving away the staking rewards on its Ether to keep the yield on its liquid staking token \u2014 called mETH \u2014 above 7%.\n\n\u201cUsers love the yield,\u201d 0xVEER, Mantle\u2019s pseudonymous head of business development, told DL News.\n\nThe hope is that by subsidising yields, Mantle can catch up to Lido and carve out a slice of the $37 billion Ether liquid staking market for itself.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut it\u2019s not alone \u2014 other liquid staking protocols, both old and new, are banking on a variety of strategies to increase their share of the market.\n\nMantle\u2019s mETH success\n\nAccording to 0xVEER, Mantle plans to keep subsidising the mETH yields until April 1 as part of its \u201cmETH Double Dose Drive\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cThe ticker symbol has also become a bit of a meme for obvious reasons, which certainly helps with creating some buzz and getting people to talk about mETH,\u201d 0xVEER said.\n\nAnd DeFi users are piling in. Over the past month, the amount of Ether staked through Mantle has jumped 65%. The protocol now controls over $1.5 billion worth of Ether, or around 3.8% of all Ether staked through liquid staking protocols.\n\nThe value of deposits locked up in Mantle's Ether liquid staking protocol.\n\nHowever, there are limitations to Mantle\u2019s boosted mETH yields.\n\nTo ensure yields stay high, Mantle initially capped the supply of mETH to 250,000. The cap now sits at 520,420 mETH, of which 511,081 has already been minted, per the Mantle website.\n\nWith limited capacity, Mantle can\u2019t keep subsidising the mETH yield forever. At some point its campaign will stop, and there will be little it can do to stop stakers from going elsewhere.\n\nOne way Mantle is attempting to keep mETH stakers around is by \u201chinting at ecosystem incentives for those who bridge mETH from Ethereum to Mantle Network,\u201d according to 0xVEER.\n\nIf users bridge their mETH over to Mantle, it may make it less likely they will convert it back into Ether.\n\nDifferent approaches\n\nOther liquid staking protocols use different strategies to compete.\n\nSwell, a newer entrant to the liquid staking market, has promised a token airdrop. Stakers can earn points for staking Ether through the protocol and using the swETH liquid staking token in DeFi. Points will then be converted into tokens at a later date.\n\nSo far, Swell has attracted over $734 million worth of deposits with this strategy.\n\nRocket Pool, the second-biggest liquid staking protocol behind Lido with some $3.3 billion of deposits, focuses more on protocol design and ideology than on incentives.\n\nIt calls itself the leading decentralised liquid staking protocol because of its more than 3,500 individual validator operators. It lets users run their own validator nodes \u2014 software that helps process transactions on Ethereum in return for staking rewards \u2014 with just eight Ether, compared with the standard 32 Ether required.\n\nLido, on the other hand, has just 37 validator node operators.\n\nBack over at Mantle, there are signs that maintaining a higher-than-average yield is becoming difficult. Although the protocol targets a 7.2% annual yield for mETH, it often falls short of that target. On February 19, the mETH token\u2019s five-day average yield sat at 6.76%.\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped the token\u2019s outsized growth compared with its peers \u2014 just two months after launch, it\u2019s become the fourth-largest Ether liquid staking token.\n\nDisclosure: The author of this article holds Swell\u2019s swETH liquid staking token.\n\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Earlier today, XRP plunged to just 0.000184 on the Binance exchange, according to TradingView data.\n\nWhen XRP surpassed Ethereum\n\nIn September 2018, the Ripple-affiliated XRP token experienced a remarkable surge, overtaking Ethereum to become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThis shift in ranking was fueled by bullish sentiment from investors, who believed Ripple would become the standard for international bank transfers.\n\nBack then, XRP's market cap reached $22.2 billion, eclipsing Ethereum's $22.1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the data provided, Ethereum has a market capitalization of $346.957 billion, while XRP's market cap stands at $29.308 billion. This indicates that Ethereum's market cap is significantly larger than that of XRP.\n\nEthereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing behind Bitcoin. XRP is positioned in a distant sixth place.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThe underperformance of XRP against Ethereum has sparked a series of unfounded conspiracy theories within the crypto community.\n\nSome supporters of XRP argue that the SEC may have shown favoritism toward Ethereum, giving it a \"free pass\" while choosing to pursue legal action against XRP.\n\nThese unfounded theories, often shared on social media and cryptocurrency forums, imply that Ethereum's backers could have inappropriately swayed the SEC's regulatory actions, a claim for which there is no concrete evidence. This narrative has gained traction despite repeated calls for evidence-based discussions.\n\nCritics of these theories, including figures like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, have pointed out the lack of proof behind such accusations and have called for a return of rational discourse within the community."

pic.twitter.com/LAXn70q7AG \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) February 17, 2024\n\nOn the more technical side of prices, the analysis highlights how since October 2023 Ethereum has been channeled into a very compact bullish trend, capable of holding the EMA 50 daily very firmly and constantly updating new highs after each short correction attempt.\n\nMore in detail, from mid-January onwards the bulls have made themselves heard in a unanimous way, bringing the prices of ether from $2,200 up to the current values.\n\nThe psychological threshold of $3,000 could now oppose new bullish incursions, with RSI showing the first signs of weakening in a trend that is heading towards overbought territory.\n\nAnyway, the consistently high volumes recorded in the last trading sessions and the recent breakout above 2,700 USD seem to favor a positive scenario for the cryptocurrency, which will likely break the resistance it is facing, albeit after several efforts.\n\nDaily chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USD)\n\nIn the field of derivatives, data analysis on Ethereum highlights a decidedly encouraging open interest, which last week reached an aggregated value on all trading platforms exceeding 7.7 billion dollars, a value that has not been seen since November 2021.\n\nEven the funding rate shows positive signals with a positive leverage funding rate on all major markets, and with numbers higher than those recorded in the last 6 months.\n\nThis means that the speculative interest in Ethereum is high and that speculators are positioning themselves (and have largely already positioned themselves) with the idea that the crypto will increase in price in the short term.\n\nPay attention to the volatility in this period because it could lead to forced liquidations: in particular, the levels of 2,877 USD, 2,870 USD, and 2,840 USD are the prices that could trigger losses for long positions excessively exposed to leverage.\n\nWeekly chart of Ethereum price (ETH/USD)\n\nThe on-chain data of the Ethereum network\n\nAfter analyzing the price of Ethereum, let\u2019s see what the on-chain data of the decentralized network are signaling to us.\n\nEven in this case the overall outlook is largely positive, with most indicators showing the presence of a fertile ground for further growth of the asset.\n\nIn particular, we observe how the number of ETH deposited on the Beacon Chain is constantly growing, as well as the number of new validators joining the network to provide their support.\n\nAs of today, about 30.87 million ETH, equivalent to over 9 billion dollars, are locked inside the protocol PoS with about 900 thousand validators among individual users and LST platforms.\n\nConsidering a circulating supply of Ethereum close to 120 million coins, we can affirm that over 25% of all ETH in circulation are locked in the Beacon chain.\n\nThis only serves to decrease the potential selling pressure and cause a scarcity of ether in the crypto markets.\n\nThis data, combined with the potential digital scarcity that will be triggered by the likely arrival of ETH spot ETFs, could push the currency towards very ambitious price levels if demand starts to be felt even slightly.\n\nIt is also very interesting to note how the average volume recorded in transactions on the Ethereum chain has remained consistently high in these first weeks of 2024, reaching the maximum level of 4 billion USD daily, reached as a maximum in March 2023.\n\nA high volume supports speculative interest in the price of ETH, which coincidentally has increased precisely in conjunction with the cryptocurrency rally from October onwards.\n\nAirdrops, fomo for new DeFi protocols and new memecoins have supported the network\u2019s trading volume throughout 2023, with a boost in metrics in the last few months.\n\nIn conclusion, it is considered appropriate to show this analysis that indicates the number of on-chain Ethereum addresses that hold an average purchase price lower than the current prices, therefore they are in profit.\n\nIt is worth noting how from November onwards the percentage of profitable addresses compared to the total network has skyrocketed, going from 40% to the current 94%.\n\nThis means that 94 out of 100 addresses have a positive PNL compared to their purchase price and could potentially unload their positions at any moment.\n\nUsually in the past, when the percentage of addresses in gain has reached this value, very violent selling sessions have followed which have led to a sharp drop in the price of ETH.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this value remained high for several months during the previous bull market, so in this case too we may see a long time pass before the storm arrives."

        "title": "ETH ETF : Ethereum ETF Date Released? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Rumors are taking over the crypto community for the Ethereum ETF release date. It\u2019s speculated that Ethereum ETF approval might happen in March. ETH ETF has become the next target of investors all because of Bitcoin ETF\u2019s success, and people can\u2019t wait to see the same success for ETH ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETF had a positive price prediction and gained $10 Billion in AUM (Assets Under Management) within a month. It\u2019s exciting to see how Ethereum ETF will perform. So, what\u2019s the expected Ethereum ETF date? Let\u2019s find that out in this blog.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s Ethereum ETF?\n\nEthereum ETF is a product created to track the Ethereum price , facilitating the buying and selling of Ethereum on various exchanges. It is a convenient way to become a part of the crypto market without directly managing the assets.\n\nETH ETF mirrors the behavior of Ethereum in the market and offers exposure to its value without complexities. It is operated under the regulatory framework of the crypto market, allowing the regulated and secure channel for investors to invest in crypto. Ethereum ETF has regulatory advantages and offers security and liquidity, perfect for beginners or people who don\u2019t want to manage digital assets.\n\nIn general, an ETF is a large pool of money replicating the price growth of the assets it is tracking. There are 1000s of these ETFs that come from different companies, but most are chasing to replicate the price growth of the same thing. You give up your assets and get protection, efficiency, and simplicity.\n\nEthereum ETF Might Happen In March?\n\nWith the increased hopes from Ethereum ETF, everyone is presenting their views for a possible date. Some have predicted that it might get approved by March, and some have expected the May month. There\u2019s still no certainty when it might happen because it took 10 ten years for the Bitcoin ETF to get approved.\n\nThe delays seem to be because of the SEC\u2019s uncertain take on Ethereum being a commodity or Security. ETH ETF approval chances are comparatively lower than Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe SEC has stated multiple times that Bitcoin is a commodity, not a security. This kind of clarification never came forward in the case of Ethereum. The SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, has given vague answers on Ethereum\u2019s status as Security.\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that Ethereum ETF will happen, probably after a few months. World leaders like Ben Weiss, CEO of CoinFlip, and Ryan Lee, the chief analyst of Bitgetrt Research, have speculated the spot ETH ETFs are high.\n\nCompanies like Blackrock and Grayscale have already applied for Spot ETH ETF. Blackrock, the asset management company, has applied for Spot Ethereum ETF together with the Bitcoin ETF. They officially filed with Nasdaq to get their ETH spot ETF.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s SEC ETF history reveals that the SEC has approved the majority of its filled Spot ETFs. The company\u2019s approval record is 575-1. It is one of the factors the Ethereum community is considering in ETH ETF approval.\n\nDespite Ethereum ETF being on hold, the price of Ethereum is rising. Ethereum is continuously bullish through this month and is currently trading at $2932.55 with a trading volume of $15,638,161,033.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin ETF\u2019s successful launch has increased the expectations for the ETH ETF, and people are patiently waiting for the SEC\u2019s approval. The Ethereum ETF date is not out but it might happen in May. In addition, the majority of investors and analysts have indicated that this will happen before 2024 ends.\n\nEzra Icy Ezra Icy, the creative wizard from Phoenix, Arizona, specializes in crafting magnetic content for Web3 brands.

        "title": "Crypto Exchange FixedFloat Hacked: $26 Million in BTC, ETH Stolen - HackRead",
        "content": "Another day, another cryptocurrency exchange falls victim to a massive data breach. This time, it\u2019s FixedFloat, a non-KYC Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto exchange targeted in a wallet-drainer attack.\n\nFixedFloat, a decentralized crypto exchange, has been hacked for at least $26 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The attack, initially attributed to minor technical issues, has led to frozen transactions and missing funds.\n\nFor your information, FixedFloat is an automated crypto exchange with 26% of its web traffic coming from the US. It integrates with Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAs seen by Hackread.com, users reported frozen transactions and missing funds on the X exchange since February 17, with 409 Bitcoin (Approximately $21 million) and 1,728 Ether tokens (approximately $4.7 million) drained on February 18.\n\nThe exchange is investigating the security incident. FixedFloat\u2019s website is also displaying an error message on all pages, stating \u201cERROR \u2013 Technical work is underway, we will be back soon! If you need to contact us, you can do this via chat.\u201d\n\nThe stolen funds were sent to the Ethereum exchange. Threat researcher going by the X (formerly Twitter) handle of \u201cOfficer\u2019s Notes\u201d revealed that the hacker first transferred ETH to different ETH addresses and finally moved them to the eXch exchange. They then sent funds to two HitBTC addresses, which received their initial ETH deposits in 2021. This seems to be an attempt to create a false trail.\n\n. @FixedFloat hacked, resulting in ~1,728 ETH (worth ~$4.85m) and & 409 BTC (worth ~$21m) stolen. The drainer already transferred most of the stolen ETH to eXch on Ethereum. 26M$ loss in total!\n\n\n\nDrainer on Ethereum (1700 ETH stolen): 0x85c4fF99bF0eCb24e02921b0D4b5d336523Fa085\u2026 https://t.co/imeXB1h7Jv pic.twitter.com/oquw373NOG \u2014 Officer's Notes (@officer_cia) February 19, 2024\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any addresses (other than the hacker\u2019s address) that link these 2 HitBTC deposit addresses\u2026Most likely, the hacker created only a false trail,\u201d the researcher explained on X (Twitter). This was confirmed by the Web3 security platform Cyvers on X as well.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange confirmed it was an external attack, rubbishing rumours of insider involvement. Users and analysts initially claimed FixedFloat developers were behind the hacking, but the exchange denied any internal involvement.\n\nAlthough the company is yet to reveal the core information on how it happened, cybersecurity researchers are positive that the hack was caused by vulnerabilities and insufficient security measures, allowing the attacker to bypass defences and access core service functions.\n\nWallet Drainer Attack?\n\nAs to what type of vulnerabilities, researchers believe that it was a wallet drainer attack. A wallet drainer attack is a malicious technique employed by cybercriminals to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims\u2019 wallets. It typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts or tricking users into granting unauthorized access to their funds.\n\nFixedFloat stated that no user funds were affected, but the hack affected 30 outstanding orders, which the exchange will pay as soon as its services resume.\n\nFixedFloat faced criticism for not reporting the hack immediately, while the company maintains it was focusing on minimizing loss and eliminating vulnerabilities. The platform expects full operations to resume soon and release a detailed report after the investigation is complete.\n\nSurge in Drainer Attacks\n\nNevertheless, it is concerning that cryptocurrency exchanges have become a prominent target of scammers lately. Last month Group-IB Global Pvt. Ltd. disclosed details of a phishing operation dubbed Inferno Drainer targeting cryptocurrency wallet providers. The scammers targeted over 100 brands and 16,000 malicious domains, stealing over $80 million in digital assets from November 2022 to November 2023. The team reaped $87 million in illicit profits and scammed over 137,000 victims.\n\nIn June 2023, Pink Drainer, a notorious hacker group, successfully executed a series of high-profile Discord and Twitter hacks targeting projects like Evomos, Pika Protocol, OpenAI CTO, and Orbiter Finance. Online scam detector ScamSniffer confirmed Pink Drainer stole around $3 million from nearly 1,932 victims."

        "title": "Coinbase To SEC: 5 Arguments For A Spot Ethereum ETF - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has formally responded to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the proposal for a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, announced through social media platform X that the company submitted a comprehensive 27-page response, complete with 96 citations, to advocate for the approval of the proposed Grayscale Ether Trust (ETHE) ETP.\n\nToday @coinbase responded to @SECGov's request for comment on the proposed @Grayscale Ether Trust ($ETHE) ETP. 27 pages and 96 citations that provide the (1) legal, (2) technical, and (3) economic rationale for approval. 1/6 \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) February 21, 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s Classification As A Commodity\n\nThe cornerstone of Coinbase\u2019s argument rests on the classification of ETH as a commodity rather than a security. Grewal\u2019s articulation, \u201cETH is not a security\u2026before and after the Merge, the SEC, the CFTC, and the market have treated ETH not as a security but a commodity,\u201d underscores the consensus among regulatory bodies and market participants regarding Ethereum\u2019s status. This classification aligns with the legal framework necessary for the SEC to consider an ETF based on ETH.\n\nPrecedent Set By Bitcoin ETF Approvals\n\nCoinbase leverages the SEC\u2019s prior approval of Bitcoin ETFs as a precedent, advocating for consistent regulatory treatment for Ethereum. Grewal posits, \u201cThe economics show that ETH is as resilient as BTC in satisfying the Commission\u2019s standard for ETP approvals,\u201d highlighting the parallel between Ether\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s market robustness and maturity. This comparison serves to remind the SEC of the rationale behind its earlier decisions and suggests a similar approach for ETH.\n\nTechnological And Operational Security Of Ethereum\n\nThe submission emphasizes the technological and operational security mechanisms inherent in Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, particularly post-Merge. The transition to Proof of Stake is presented as a significant enhancement to Ethereum\u2019s security features, reducing its susceptibility to fraud and manipulation. This technological robustness is a critical factor in Coinbase\u2019s argument, underscoring the reliability and stability of ETH as an underlying asset for an ETF.\n\nMarket Dynamics And Resilience\n\nCoinbase presents a detailed analysis of Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics, including its depth, liquidity, and the tightness of spreads. Grewal notes, \u201cETH\u2019s market depth, tightness of spreads, and price correlation across spot markets are highly indicative of a market resilient to fraud and manipulation.\u201d This argument is designed to assure the SEC of ETH\u2019s market stability and its capacity to support an ETF without introducing significant risks to investors.\n\nSurveillance-Sharing Agreement And Market Oversight\n\nFinally, Coinbase highlights the surveillance-sharing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a mechanism for ensuring comprehensive market oversight. This agreement, as described by Grewal, \u201cfacilitates the sharing of information\u2026through its surveillance of the CME ETH futures market,\u201d which is crucial for monitoring and preventing fraudulent and manipulative practices in the ETH market.\n\nIn conclusion, Coinbase\u2019s submission to the SEC is a rigorously constructed argument that combines legal precedent, technical security, and market stability analyzes to advocate for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nStandard Chartered predicts SEC approval for an Ethereum ETF by May 23, potentially causing a price surge to $4,000 for ETH. However, Dave LaValle, head of Grayscale ETFs, recently said there is only a 50% chance that the SEC will approve the conversion of its ETH trust into a spot ETF in May.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,961.\n\nFeatured image created with DALLE, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "The supply held by non-exchange whale addresses increased significantly in February.\n\nThe accumulation frenzy could be because of the rapidly rising MVRV Ratio.\n\nEthereum [ETH] broke past $2,900 in the last few hours of trading as positive momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency persisted over the weekend.\n\nThe digital asset was trading at $2,907 at press time, up 3.65% in the last 24 hours, and over 16% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of CryptoQuant data, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio bounced above 1, indicating that buying pressure for ETH was stronger than selling pressure at press time.\n\nThe next target for the ETH bulls was the psychologically important $3,000 level. Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange BuyUcoin, told AMBCrypto,\n\n\u201cAn important level for Ethereum to breach is $3,000, after which we can see a potential rally in the prices of altcoins.\u201d\n\nWhales are making the right moves!\n\nAmidst the surge, the behavior of a particular whale investor caught the attention of the market.\n\nThe wealthy holder grabbed a whopping 21,353 ETH worth $60 million just before prices rose, data from Lookonchain revealed. They did so by swapping Tether [USDT] tokens for ETH on Binance [BNB].\n\nAfter some time, the whale withdrew 10,649 ETH, amounting to a little over $30 million, in a separate transaction.\n\nIn fact, the whale has been on an accumulation spree since the 8th of February, having amassed around 52,759 ETH coins as of this writing. The ensuing rally helped the investor make $100 million in profits.\n\nThis was not an isolated case. Ethereum whales in general have shown urgency in accumulating coins at every given opportunity, evidenced by a jump in transactions worth more than $1 million.\n\nMoreover, the supply held by top non-exchange addresses has increased by 2 million since the start of February.\n\nThe lure of higher returns\n\nA big reason behind the accumulation frenzy could be because of the rapidly rising 30-day MVRV Ratio.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nAs per AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of Santiment data, ETH\u2019s prevailing price was 16.43% higher than the average acquisition price.\n\nConsidering that ETH was still a good distance away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, the buying spree might continue."

        "content": "LISBON, Portugal, Feb. 21, 2024 /CNW/ -- Fuel Labs , creator of the first optimistic rollup Fuel V1, today announced its evolution into the \"Rollup OS\", a complete operating system specifically designed to help Ethereum rollups realize their full potential. Specifically designed to tackle critical limitations in the existing rollups architectures, the strategic shift strengthens Fuel Labs' position as a visionary in the Ethereum ecosystem while paving the way for its mainnet launch in Q3 2024.\n\nUnlike existing virtual machines (VMs) designed for layer-1 (L1) blockchains or general-purpose computation systems, Fuel offers the first purpose-built VM that will unlock new capabilities for Ethereum rollups.\n\nFuel's unique architecture addresses core challenges in blockchain scalability beyond the conventional paradigm of modularity and even data availability \u2014 enabling higher throughput via parallelization, state minimization, seamless interoperability and VM customizability.\n\n\"As rollups mature, it's clear that an operating environment optimized for their unique requirements is a non-negotiable next step. Fuel is that evolution: the 'Rollup OS' solves critical bottlenecks, future-proofing both rollup technology and the Ethereum ecosystem,\" said Nick Dodson, CEO and Co-Founder of Fuel Labs.\n\nAddressing Ethereum's Scaling Bottleneck\n\nEthereum's reign as the dominant smart contract platform is undeniable, yet its future-readiness and developer appeal hinges on EVM's ability to solve future requirements of Ethereum rollups. As rollups and modular infrastructure rise, existing technologies made for general computation, or monolithic L1 systems, fail to address the evolving demands of this rollup-centric reality.

        "content": "Tue 20 Feb 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nRecently, Ether (ETH), the native crypto of Ethereum, has seen notable momentum. The asset is currently flirting with the $3,000 mark. This has sparked hope among crypto enthusiasts about the continuation of this trend with a positive effect on altcoins. A question that clearly divides analysts and experts.\n\nThe Hope of an Altcoin Season Driven by Ethereum\u2019s Ether (ETH)\n\nThe recent surge in the price of Ether (ETH), which has flirted with the $3,000 mark, has sparked hope for an impending \u201caltseason\u201d within the crypto community. However, analysts remain divided on the issue. On February 19, Ethereum\u2019s native crypto reached an intraday high of $2,980. That\u2019s its highest level in 22 months. Many enthusiasts believe this could herald the start of an ETH bull market and, consequently, an altcoin rally.\n\nHenrik Andersson, Chief Investment Officer at Apollo Capital, highlighted several fundamental factors underpinning this sentiment. Among these are the upcoming updates to Ethereum and the mainnet launches for scaling solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum\u2019s relative underperformance compared to Bitcoin over the past year suggests a potential catch-up. Especially given its deflationary nature following the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS).\n\nYuga Cohler, Senior Director of Engineering at Coinbase, echoed similar sentiments. He notably highlights the correlation between an ETH bull market and positive outcomes for altcoins. Meanwhile, voices like that of Mikybull Crypto forecast a bullish March for the native asset of Ethereum blockchain, with $3,000 as a plausible target. He anticipates a significant increase in altcoin activity.\n\nHopefuls call for \u2018#altseason\u2019 led by #Ethererum rally, analysts not so sure https://t.co/LUxw2uzJVz \u2014 MrMr4Nk \ud83d\udc99 De.Fi Army (@MrCr4nk) February 20, 2024 While enthusiasts anticipate an altcoin season driven by Ether, some analysts remain skeptical\n\nDissenting Voices Regarding This Outlook\n\nHowever, Markus Thielen, Head of 10x Research, holds an opposing view. According to him, there is a lack of substantial evidence for the eventuality of an impending altcoin season. He points out that sustainable reductions in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance below 45% are required to foster a viable altcoin rally.\n\nThe crypto expert also notes that unlike previous increases observed during the ICO and DeFi summer bull markets, the current rise lacks a clear explanation. Save for the influx of investments into spot Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, the recent altcoin rallies have quickly dissipated, suggesting a higher risk-adjusted potential in favor of investments in BTC.\n\nMarkus Thielen\u2019s analysis also questions the sustainability of Ethereum\u2019s momentum. He believes it could be more motivated by the anticipation of the ETF approvals in May than by an increase in on-chain activity within decentralized applications (dApps). For the analyst, the current bull market will persist until 2025, a period during which altcoins may experience sporadic recoveries.\n\nSupporting Markus Thielen\u2019s cautious outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment cautions against overbought signals on the market. As indicated by the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, it suggests above-average risk associated with buying or opening new positions during the current surge. This is while most crypto projects have generated medium and long-term profits since October 2023.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "title": "Ether Skyrockets: Hits $3K Milestone as ETH ETF Hope Grows - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "Wall Street analysts led by Bernstein broker believe there is a 50 percent approval chance for spot Ethereum ETFs by May in the United States.\n\nEther\u2019s price reaching $3k for the first time in more than two years signals the beginning of the much-anticipated altseason.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has officially begun the race to $10,000 after reaching $3k for the first time since May 2022. Ethereum price has as a result recovered all the losses induced by the collapse of Terra Luna UST. Furthermore, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rallied above the 70 level for the first time since May 2021, thus confirming the bulls are in control.\n\nRemarkably, Ethereum\u2019s price has outshined that of Bitcoin in the past week, with the latter increasing by 4.4% and the former by more than 12%. The notable rise in Ethereum price has been attributed to improved fundamentals and heightened demand from both institutional investors and retail traders. Moreover, ETH is the primary source of liquidity for the majority of web3 tokens and NFTs.\n\nTop Reasons Ethereum Price Rallied to $3k for the First Time in Two Years\n\nEthereum price rallied more than 88% since October last year to trade above $2,900 on Wednesday fueled by several notable fundamental factors. On the top list, the Ethereum investment products have registered notable cash inflows from institutional investors in the past few months. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States has raised the odds of Ether-based ETFs soon.\n\nWorth noting that the same fund managers that applied and received approval for spot BTC ETFs in the United States are now racing to offer Ether-based products. As CNF recently reported, Bernstein analysts believe there is a 50 percent chance the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the spot Ether ETFs by May.\n\nThe Ethereum price registered notable gains in the recent past fueled by heightened crypto cash rotation as more investors bet big on web3 mass adoption. With the Ethereum network already a deflationary ecosystem through the burning mechanism akin to the Bitcoin halving, the value of existing coins will continue to skyrocket.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ether price has enjoyed a bullish outlook in the recent past as the Ethereum core developers anticipate enabling its largest upgrade since Shanghai dubbed the Dencun upgrade in the coming weeks. Notably, the Dencun upgrade is primarily meant to lower transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s layer-two ecosystem following proto-dank sharding.\n\nETH Price Analysis and Short-term Targets\n\nThe Ethereum price has only begun its long journey to a parabolic move expected later in the confirmed crypto bull cycle. From a technical standpoint, ETH bulls are well incentivized to rally above $3,000 in the coming months.\n\nAccording to the latest market data, ETH price has rallied over 25% in the past two weeks to trade at around $2,940 on Wednesday.\n\nKenny Hearn, SwissOne Capital\u2019s chief investment officer, noted;\n\nWe are very close in this move to levels around $3,150-$3,300. The next level after that would be $3,600 and we think this is quite easily attainable in the next month or so as the alts continue to play catch up,\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Sharp Rejection Near $3,000 As Profit-Taking Sentiment Rises! What\u2019s Next For ETH Price? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "After [ccpw id=60415] soared past the $50K milestone, traders eagerly anticipated [ccpw id=60480] to mirror this success by crossing the $3K threshold. This expectation came to a conclusion as Ethereum shattered its two-year peak by breaking the $3,000 milestone, setting off a wave of short liquidations. This breakthrough has triggered bullish outlooks, prompting a rise in Ethereum accumulation by investors who are now gearing up for potential further price surges. Nevertheless, with the increase in profit-taking behavior around that mark and the exit of both long-term and short-term holders near the peak, this led to a steep decline in the ETH price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Becomes Positive\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has climbed to $53,000, but Ethereum has outpaced BTC\u2019s gains, reaching $3,000 for the first time in almost two years. These price increases have put highly leveraged traders on alert, leading to total liquidations of around $300 million.\n\nYet, Ethereum\u2019s price is now undergoing a significant drop as many investors sold their stakes near the $3,000 peak. Notably, Ethereum saw total liquidations nearing $8.6 million, with a substantial $8.5 million of those being buyer liquidations. The week started off on a slower note, but Bitcoin made an aggressive move to $53,000, hitting this level for the first time since late 2021.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that the Netflow metric for ETH has moved into the positive territory, indicating that the volume of inflows now exceeds that of outflows. This shift points to a rise in exchange reserves, increasing the likelihood of sales and thus exerting downward pressure near resistance levels. The Netflow metric currently registers at +20,470 ETH.\n\nMoreover, the volume of large transactions has doubled recently, jumping from a low of 1.08 million ETH to 2.26 million ETH. This increase signals a rise in activity by major investors or \u201cwhales.\u201d In the event of such a market rejection, these whales could lose confidence, potentially triggering a wave of selling pressure that may drive the ETH price down to its immediate support levels.\n\nHowever, the bullish sentiment continues as ETH\u2019s network is poised for a pivotal enhancement called \u201cDencun,\u201d scheduled for March. This update is set to deploy \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d to the blockchain, which is expected to boost its performance and lower transaction fees.\n\nA Bloomberg analyst has projected a potential rise in ether\u2019s value to $4,000, drawing parallels with bitcoin\u2019s rally preceding the approval of spot ETFs. On the other hand, TD Cowen and JPMorgan express skepticism; TD Cowen questions the immediate approval of spot ether ETFs by the SEC, while JPMorgan assigns a probability of less than 50% for such approval by May.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther rebounded off the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that buyers are attempting to solidify this level as a foundation of support. Consequently, this boosted the buyers\u2019 confidence, enabling them to surpass the immediate Fibonacci retracement levels and break past the $3,000 mark. Currently, the price of ETH stands at $2,948, marking an increase of over 1.1% from the previous day\u2019s value.\n\nAlthough the price managed to breach the immediate barrier of $3,000, it couldn\u2019t maintain its surge as sellers initiated a pullback. Nonetheless, buyers are keen on maintaining the upward momentum with hopes of driving the price towards the critical resistance level at $3,100. Achieving this could set the stage for a move towards $3,500.\n\nThe recent price rejection has plunged the Relative Strength Index (RSI) toward 58, hinting at the possibility of a minor correction or a consolidation phase looming. For a short-term peak to be indicated, sellers would have to send the price below the 20-day EMA."

        "title": "What Does The Future Hold For Bitcoin, Ethereum, and KangaMoon? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nIn the rising DeFi market, newcomers are finding themselves in the spotlight. KangaMoon (KANG) is one of those newcomers. Some analysts have even hinted that this meme coin, which will soon enter its presale, could surge by 35x in 2024. But how does this rookie compare to already-established cryptos like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nKangaMoon (KANG): A Potential Star in the Memecoin Sector\n\nKangaMoon (KANG) is a community-driven meme coin that everyone has been talking about. It is making a splash with its unique approach of combining memes and cryptocurrency. By focusing on building a solid community and introducing play-to-earn elements, KangaMoon is looking to be one of the top meme coin out there.\n\nKangaMoon could accomplish this as it will introduce a P2E game in which KANG is the main currency used for everything. With KANG, players can purchase in-game items, upgrade their characters, and more.\n\nKangaMoon will also incorporate a marketplace where you can sell or trade any in-game collectibles you have gained. Therefore, any player can make money from their time in the game.\n\nCurrently, the DeFi project is preparing to enter its presale. During this time, you can buy the KANG token for a discounted price of only $0.0075.\n\nHowever, since it will enter the $176B gaming market, experts are bullish about this meme coin. They forecast a potential 350% price pump once a Tier-1 CEX lists KANG in 2024.\n\nAnalyst Elja With a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nRecently, crypto analyst Elja made a bullish Ethereum (ETH) price prediction. According to his new tweet, Ethereum may hit $15,000 by 2025. He states that this explosive move will come as whales accumulate this altcoin.\n\nOver the last week, the Ethereum price has been bouncing between $2,402 and $2,272. In that same time period, its market cap moved between $288B and $272B. However, 20 technical indicators are in the green for this altcoin. Due to all these reasons, market analysts predict that Ethereum will hit $2,400 before the end of February 2024.\n\nRekt Capital\u2019s New Bitcoin Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also been making headlines. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that a new Candle 4 has formed for Bitcoin at the $39,357 level. He predicts that this Candle will be broken after the Bitcoin halving event.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has jumped from $40,790 to $42,261 over the past week alone. During that time, its market cap has also increased from $799B to $825B. Furthermore, this DeFi coin now trades above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Because of this, experts in the field foresee a Bitcoin price of within Q2 of 2024.\n\nWill KangaMoon Outpace Ethereum and Bitcoin?\n\nSince it is so early in its development, KangaMoon has gained a competitive edge over Ethereum and Bitcoin. To clarify, KangaMoon now has a market cap of $5M. Because of this, KANG would need less money to raise its price. This puts it in a good position to become the next top memecoin in 2024.\n\nDiscover the Exciting Opportunities of the Kangamoon (KANG) Presale Today!\n\nWebsite: https://Kangamoon.com\n\nJoin Our Telegram Community: https://t.me/Kangamoonofficial\n\n*This article was paid for.

Points didn't tell you how many tokens you would get (issuers rarely confirmed that they were even tied to airdrops in the first place), but they nonetheless became catnip for cryptocurrency traders looking for high-potential investment opportunities."

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s Dave LaValle recently claimed that an Ethereum spot ETF now stands a 50/50 chance of an SEC approval in May following Gary Gensler\u2019s BTC approval last month.\n\nAt a recent annual ETF conference, crypto took center stage, with executives from the world\u2019s largest financial and investment firms all interested in a piece of the crypto pie.\n\nAs BlackRock and Fidelity have dominated the Bitcoin ETF inflows with billions of dollars between them, the significance of Grayscale and its role in making the ETFs a reality seems lost on many. However, it was the crypto asset manager that forced the SEC to rethink its denial, and according to one Grayscale executive, Gary Gensler could yet again hand crypto another major win with an Ethereum ETF approval in a few months.\n\nAt the recent Exchange ETF Conference in Miami Beach, Florida, industry leaders from BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Invesco and other ETF giants took to the stage to discuss the latest trends in the market. Unlike in all the previous editions, this year\u2019s event had a new trending topic\u2013cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nDave LaValle, the Senior Managing Director and Global Head of ETFs at Grayscale, was among the speakers in a panel discussing the Bitcoin ETFs launched last month. He expressed his confidence that an Ethereum ETF would be next, saying there was a \u201950/50\u2032 chance that Gensler would approve one in May.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Dave LaValle, #Grayscale ETFs honcho, predicts a 50/50 shot for #SEC approval on #Ethereum ETF conversion to spot #ETH ETF in May! \ud83d\udcc8 Meanwhile, a #BitcoinETF rep reveals some advisors still can't shout out #Bitcoin to clients! \ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/RmszNv42cr pic.twitter.com/5EvDP0ESMI \u2014 Marcel Knobloch aka Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) February 21, 2024\n\nThe crypto ETF success came about because Grayscale took the SEC to court after the agency denied its application, accusing the regulator of \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct. This legal battle inevitably arose during the panel, with the moderator asking LaValle if Grayscale would sue the SEC again if it denied its Ethereum ETF.\n\nAccording to LaValle, the crypto asset manager can\u2019t rule out this approach, but it would first \u201chave to wait and see and look at the facts.\u201d\n\nGrayscale Confident Ethereum ETF is Coming\n\nLaValle isn\u2019t the only one confident that an Ethereum spot ETF is coming. Brock Pierce, the founder of the Bitcoin Foundation and one of the people behind the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, Tether, also believes that Gensler will give the green light soon.\n\nHe told Fox Business:\n\nI believe an Ethereum ETF should be in the works. The applications are there and with this precedent established, it\u2019s only a matter of time before an Ethereum ETF would exist. It clearly has the market cap and there\u2019s the demand, and I think retail investors would like the easy accessibility. The American people deserve easy access to the products they want to invest in.\n\nBut while the market guesses when the Ethereum spot ETF will debut, one thing is sure\u2014crypto ETFs are the next big thing. As of Feb. 20, BlackRock\u2019s BitcoinETF had attracted $5.4 billion, while Fidelity, in second place, had brought in $3.72 billion. Bitwise and Ark have also crossed the $1 billion threshold.\n\nAt the ETF Conference in Miami Beach, all the crypto panels were filled to the brim, with Galaxy Asset Management\u2019s Steve Kurz best capturing it when he said:\n\nI\u2019d be surprised in the next year if the top 10 wirehouses are not involved in this. We will probably see institutional FOMO.\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson thinks there is a likelihood that the ETHGate scandal is real.\n\nDuring a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson suggested that ETHGate could be real.\n\n\u201cI never once said that ETHGate didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he remarked.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHoskinson stated that it is possible that someone from Ethereum might have bribed certain officials at the SEC to give ETH a pass.\n\nPer Hoskinson, establishing relationships with top regulators to get favorable regulations is not a new practice. He mentioned that most entities outside the crypto space also engage in such acts.\n\nWhile there is a chance that ETHGate is real, Hoskinson noted that the theory has no relevance to Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nETHGate Scandal\n\nFor context, ETHGate has been a major topic of discussion for years. The theory involves allegations suggesting that certain members of the Ethereum core team established relationships with notable figures at the SEC to give ETH a regulatory edge over other crypto assets.\n\nPioneers of these theories believe that this relationship prompted former director of SEC\u2019s Corporation of Finance William Hinman to declare ETH as a non-security during his infamous speech in June 2018.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, Hoskinson has previously highlighted the possibility of someone from Ethereum bribing the SEC to give ETH a free pass.\n\nHowever, he denied having direct knowledge about the incident since he left Ethereum during its early days to establish Cardano.\n\nHostilities Between Hoskinson and XRP Community Lingers\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson\u2019s comments regarding the ETHGate scandal have birthed a lot of controversies, creating hostilities between him and XRP community members.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, XRP community members have given a different meaning to ETHGate. He noted that some XRP holders alleged that the ETHGate theory involves Ethereum officials bribing the SEC to sue crypto payments company Ripple.\n\nThe Cardano founder labeled the allegation as a grand conspiracy, noting that there is no evidence to support the claim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely separate subject from Ethereum taking care of its own interest and trying to find relationships to help steer along a regulatory interpretation in their favor like most entities do,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a different conversation that somebody from the Ethereum side or otherwise gave money or did something for a regulator to go after you, the XRP people. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe feud between Hoskinson and the XRP community has lingered for years, with Hoskinson taking steps to end it. Last year, he publicly sought peace to end the hostilities.\n\nHowever, his peace attempts yielded no results, as both parties continued to hurl derogatory comments at each other."

        "content": "The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has decided to test the waters with the launch of its latest NFT (non-fungible token) collection. This NFT collection, known as the \u2018SHEboshis\u2019, is different from the norm as it incorporates the ERC-404 token standard.\n\nShiba Inu Exploring New Horizons With ERC-404\n\nShiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya mentioned in a blog post how the team was choosing to venture into the \u201cunchartered territories of the ERC-404 standard\u201d with the Sheboshi launch. This adventure is no doubt an exciting one for the team, as the developer noted that they were filled with anticipation for the ERC-404\u2019s \u201cuntapped potential.\u201d\n\nThis new Ethereum token standard is currently one of the leading narratives in the Ethereum ecosystem and the crypto market in general. ERC-404 is a combination of the ERC-721 (for NFTs) and ERC-20 (for fungible tokens) token standards, a move which makes NFTs more liquid and further promotes fractionalization.\n\nThe Shiba Inu team had mentioned upon the launch of the SHEboshis on February 20 that the NFTs were going to be minted on the Ethereum network (as against Shibarium). They explained that they were \u201cleveraging the immense liquidity of Ethereum to give SHEboshis the start it deserves.\u201d In the long run, the team, however, plans to bridge these NFTs (alongside Shiboshis) to Shibarium.\n\nMeanwhile, Dhairya also revealed that a bug momentarily allowed for additional minting, with some wallets acquiring more NFTs than their initial allocation. He then went on to apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused to those who were unable to mint a SHEboshi.\n\nTo compensate for this occurrence, the developer mentioned that the team has increased the total SHEboshis from 12,000 to 20,000. Therefore, those who were unable to claim and mint their NFT can now do so. After the claim period ends, the unclaimed SHEboshis will be made available to LEASH holders to purchase.\n\nSHIB price starts recovery trend | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nAllocation Of Proceeds From The Unexpected Sales\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, Dhairya also revealed how the team intends to allocate proceeds from the unexpected sales that occurred as a result of the earlier-mentioned bug. That event apparently raked in 652 ETH for the team. 50% of this revenue will be dedicated to token burns, charity donations, the team, and liquidity provision to the NFT project.\n\nFor the token burns, the team will \u201cstrategically\u201d burn SHIB, LEASH, TREAT, and SHI in order to reduce its supply and add value for the token holders. For donations, Dhairya mentioned that contributions will be made to support efforts in Japan (The Noto earthquake). Non-profits like the Manny Pacquiao Foundation and Women in Blockchain will also receive a share of the revenue.\n\n\u201cThis portion is allocated towards operational expenses and our treasury, furthering our mission towards a decentralized future as outlined in the Shib Paper,\u201d Dhairya remarked concerning the remaining 50% of the revenue.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News Flash, chart from Tradingview.com"

In a recent YouTube video, the analyst explains that, to him, the risk-reward ratio is much better with Bitcoin compared to Ethereum.\n\nI have not bought ETH in years\u2026 It does not provide as attractive of risk-adjusted returns as Bitcoin does. Ben Cowen Ben Cowen\n\nDespite acknowledging that Ethereum has made gains, Cowen\u2019s strategy has leaned towards Bitcoin for its lower risk and better returns, especially in the current cycle. He admits his own bias is due to previous profitable trades from Ethereum to Bitcoin, highlighting his concern that Ethereum continues to underperform against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Benjamin Cowen/ YouTube\n\nNet Liquidity and Ethereum\n\nCowen then goes deeper into the relationship between Ethereum\u2019s performance against Bitcoin and global monetary policy, particularly net liquidity. Ethereum\u2019s value relative to Bitcoin has previously bottomed out in alignment with shifts in monetary policy, such as interest rate cuts and transitions from quantitative tightening to easing.\n\nSource: Benjamin Cowen/ YouTube\n\nThis correlation suggests that Ethereum\u2019s performance against Bitcoin could be influenced by broader economic factors. Cowen advises caution in trying to anticipate these shifts, reflecting on the unpredictability of central bank actions and their impact on asset values.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Is ETH In the Cycle?\n\nCowen takes a deep dive into where Ethereum stands in its market cycle, comparing it to Bitcoin\u2019s past rallies. He points out that Ethereum\u2019s performance isn\u2019t set in stone; it sways with the broader economy, including changes in interest rates and whether the financial world is loosening or tightening the purse strings.\n\nHe zeros in on how the overall flow of money in the economy, or net liquidity, can affect how investments do. Cowen hints that in some economic conditions, riskier bets like Ethereum could start to shine brighter than their safer counterparts.\n\nHowever, he remains cautious, keeping his portfolio Bitcoin-heavy due to its dominance and his scepticism about Ethereum\u2019s immediate prospects."

From the outskirts of Ahmedabad, where he grew up in modest circumstances, to scaling the heights of the cryptocurrency world, Kanani's story is a testament to the transformative power of technology and vision.\n\nEarly Life and Education: The Foundation of a Visionary\n\nBorn to a family with a modest income, where his father worked in a diamond factory, Kanani was instilled with the value of education early on. Pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, he laid the groundwork for his future in the tech realm, navigating through various roles that eventually led him to the discovery of blockchain technology. This fascination was the seed for Polygon, a groundbreaking solution to Ethereum's scalability challenges.\n\nPolygon: Revolutionising Blockchain\n\nIn 2017, Kanani, alongside Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, founded Polygon (initially known as Matic). Their mission was clear: to address the high fees and slow transactions plaguing Ethereum. By creating a scalability platform that supported faster, cost-effective applications while remaining on the Ethereum network, Polygon became a pivotal player in the blockchain ecosystem. The platform's native token, Matic, saw its valuation surge, propelling Kanani and his co-founders into the ranks of billionaires.\n\nA Financial Odyssey: From 6000INR to Billions\n\nKanani's net worth, primarily built through Polygon, underscores the vast potential within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. His transition from earning a modest salary to becoming a crypto-billionaire exemplifies the lucrative opportunities available in the space. Strategic investments, including a significant stake in Polysynth, have further solidified his position as a leading figure in the crypto revolution.\n\nBeyond Blockchain: The Personal Side of a Tech Innovator\n\nDespite his monumental professional achievements, Kanani maintains a low profile regarding his personal life. Known as a family man, his story reflects not only his technical prowess but also his values and commitment to his loved ones.\n\nThe Future and Legacy\n\nIn late 2023. After six years of relentless dedication and achieving remarkable milestones, Kanani decided to step back from the day-to-day operations, seeking to explore new adventures while still supporting Polygon from the sidelines. His decision was met with emotional responses from his co-founders, reflecting the deep bond and shared vision that drove Polygon's success. His focus on strategic investments and innovation promises a bright future for the crypto ecosystem.\n\nA Tale of Innovation, Resilience, and Transformation\n\nJaynti Kanani's ascent from a young man in Gujarat to India's first crypto-billionaire is more than a success story; it's a narrative of innovation, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of dreams. As Polygon scales new heights, Kanani's journey remains a source of inspiration, encouraging future generations to dream big and innovate without bounds."

Today\u2019s update features Polkadot\u2019s steady climb, Ethereum\u2019s ambitious $3,000 target, and the explosive rise of Kangamoon, a unique meme coin shaking things up. Buckle up, because we\u2019re diving deep into the world of digital assets!\n\nPolkadot (DOT) Price Update: Stable with Room to Grow\n\nCompared to other cryptos, Polkadot hasn\u2019t seen wild swings in price lately. This past Saturday, it did experience a slight dip of around 2.38%, bringing its price down to $7.59. However, Polkadot (DOT) has been pretty steady.\n\nExperts consider Polkadot\u2019s volatility moderate, ranking it 34th among other cryptos. This suggests a steadier price movement compared to some riskier options. Looking ahead, things seem positive for Polkadot. Experts believe there\u2019s room for its price to climb before facing significant selling pressure. Currently trading at $7.78, Polkadot has support at $7.36, giving it some buffer before potential drops.\n\nThus, while not increasing, Polkadot does appear to be in a good position for potential growth with moderate volatility. This makes it an option for those seeking a more stable crypto investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Eyes $3,000 as Beacon Chain Locks Grow\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on a roll. Reaching a new peak for 2024 at $2,827 at press time, it fueled hopes of hitting the $3,000 mark soon. Adding to the excitement, a significant portion (25%) of all circulating Ethereum is now locked in the ETH 2.0 beacon chain, showcasing investors\u2019 faith in the future.\n\nBut can the momentum hold? Experts believe so. If Ethereum surpasses the initial hurdle at $2,850, $3,000 could be next. However, there\u2019s been a slight pullback today, with the price currently at $2,773, down slightly from yesterday\u2019s high.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway? Ethereum is bullish, and $3,000 seems achievable. The strong investor commitment through ETH 2.0 adds fuel to the fire.\n\n100x Potential? Kangamoon Combines P2E with Meme Coin Craze\n\nThe video game market is booming, projected to hit a staggering $583 billion by 2030!

        "title": "Q1 2024 Crypto Price Predictions: Near Protocol, Meme Moguls, Ethereum - What\u2019s in Store for These Tokens? - Techpoint Africa",
        "content": "The first quarter of 2024 will be a wild ride for many altcoins, such as Near Protocol (NEAR) and Ethereum (ETH). Today, we look at some price predictions for these hot tokens. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) - a Stage 5 presale star, has been making waves in the meme coin space. Many analysts even have it pegged as the next 100x meme coin in 2024. Let\u2019s see why.\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR): Price Soars Around 22%\n\nRecently, Near Protocol (NEAR) has been showing bullish signs. For instance, the Near Protocol price increased from $2.90 to $3.53 in the past 30 days. Its market cap also grew from $2.91B to $3.67B in that time. Not only that, Near Protocol experienced 17/30 green trading days.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, this number will increase as Near Protocol trades above its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Furthermore, this altcoin has 24 technical indicators in the green. Because of this, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Near Protocol price prediction. They forecast a surge to $4.95 within Q1 of 2024 for NEAR.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): To Rule the Meme Coin Market\n\nThe Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale is garnering a significant amount of attention and investment. This project has already raised nearly $2.5M in its presale performance, aiming to make waves in the booming meme coin sector. With real utility and an experienced team behind it, there is no reason why MGLS cannot become a blue-chip token.\n\nWhat sets Meme Moguls apart is its commitment to blending meme coin dynamics with tangible utility. Unlike most meme coins, MGLS serves a dual purpose as a governance token and the in-game currency for the upcoming Meme Moguls play-to-earn (P2E) game.\n\nIn the P2E game, players will participate in virtual stock trading experiences, gaining insights into wealth-building and investments. They may even try to \u201cBeat the Market\u201d - a game mode where you can compete against indexes like the S&P 500.\n\nThe Meme Moguls ecosystem is built on the MGLS token. Currently priced at $0.0036 during Stage 5 of its presale, early adopters are already up by 90%. And since it\u2019s set to be listed on Uniswap in Q1 2024, experts are predicting a 100x pump. At this moment, there\u2019s also a 30% deposit bonus, which adds to the overall appeal of this game-changing meme coin.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe Announces a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has also been making headlines. For instance, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe remains bullish for this altcoin. In other words, Poppe made a new tweet stating that a price increase would come after the Dencun upgrade or from a short-term peak of BTC. He claims that Ethereum will also reclaim 0.06.\n\nIn terms of the Ethereum price movement, it has jumped from $2,488 to $2,901 in the past week alone. Its market cap also grew from $299B to $348B during that time. Additionally, Ethereum is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. As a result, experts predict that this altcoin will hit $3,629 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nCan Meme Moguls Outpace Near Protocol and Ethereum?\n\nMeme Moguls hold a solid chance of outpacing giants like Near Protocol and Ethereum. With a modest market cap of $10.8M, Meme Moguls can reach heights faster by requiring fewer new funds. Thus, MGLS is one of the best meme coins to invest in if you wish to see fast returns.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "content": "Cardano (ADA) is a \u201cshitcoin\u201d without purpose that has no distinct advantage over competitors, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.\n\n\u201cWho gives a fuck? Zero?\u201d said Hayes when asked \u201cWhat about Cardano?\u201d in an interview with Coin Bureau published on Sunday.\n\nCardano Is A Shitcoin, Says Hayes\n\nContinuing to describe the cryptocurrency \u2013 a top ten digital asset by market cap \u2013 Hayes did not mince words: \u201cThe first wannabe Ethereum, and probably the first one to go to be irrelevant,\u201d he said.\n\nTypically, the popular crypto essayist and trader is well known as one of the loudest long-term Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) bulls, and often expresses interest in small-cap cryptos for short-term trading.\n\nDuring the same interview, Hayes even expressed interest in the memecoin \u201cdogwifhat\u201d calling it the \u201cbest dog money of this bull cycle.\n\n\u201cI love Rare Pepe\u2019s\u2026 I think we\u2019re going to see a resurgence of NFT trading volumes,\u201d he added.\n\nThe writer\u2019s unique callout of Cardano ruffled some feathers online \u2013 especially with the network\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson. On Tuesday, Hoskinson asked Hayes why he was \u201cthrowing shade\u201d at Cardano.\n\n\u201cCause your coin is a piece of shit man,\u201d Hayes replied. \u201cJust buy some ETH and chill.\u201d\n\nWhat Makes Cardano Unique?\n\nMuch like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform for developing decentralized applications. It also popularized as one of the first well-developed proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, which use crypto rather than energy to secure its network.\n\nHowever, many popular blockchains today now use the same mechanism, with Ethereum undergoing a massive upgrade in 2022 to adopt proof of stake. In terms of both market size and DeFi TVL, Cardano is still outsized by competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Hayes published a list of the world\u2019s most popular Dapps, and asked which of them had originated or grown most popular on the Cardano blockchain.\n\n\u201cFrom my very limited knowledge, it looks like none of them do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why ADA is dog shit.\u201d\n\nOn Bitcoin, however, Hayes remains a bull, expecting strong money printing from the Federal Reserve to drive the asset\u2019s price up soon.\n\n\u201cWhen printing money happens and you debase the value of time and human labor, we rejoice and say great, fuck you, we\u2019re gonna take Bitcoin to a million,\u201d he told Coin Bureau.\n\nLate last year, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would reach between $750,000 and $1 million by the end of 2026."

        "content": "Interest in altcoins and other digital assets is on the rise, propelled by growing confidence in the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a new study conducted by Nickel Digital Asset Management, a prominent Europe-based digital assets hedge fund manager.\n\nThis surge in optimism has led a significant majority of institutional investors and wealth managers to predict an increased demand for various digital assets. The research, which involved participants from the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates managing approximately $815 billion in assets, highlights the optimistic outlook for cryptocurrency markets, even exceeding initial expectations for 2024.\n\nThe findings reveal that 83% of the surveyed financial experts are anticipating that the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum will boost interest in altcoins. Additionally, 72% are confident that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 price point, although opinions vary on the timeframe for this milestone, with half of the optimists expecting it to happen within the next five years.\n\nSurveys conducted in January 2024 had investors forecasting Bitcoin to reach $45,000 by year's end, yet the cryptocurrency has already exceeded $51,000, outstripping many predictions. Similarly, Ethereum's current value has surpassed the anticipated $2,500 mark, highlighting the accelerated growth and early achievement of year-end forecasts for the digital currency market. Currently, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has already exceeded the $1.4 trillion level predicted by 60% of respondents, standing just under $2 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnatoly Crachilov, CEO and Founding Partner of Nickel Digital, shared insights on the momentum gathered in the early part of the year, driven by a broad-based demand for Bitcoin, especially following a successful ETF launch. Crachilov noted, \"The confidence of institutional investors in market growth in 2024 is striking, but even this optimism got eclipsed by the actual growth in the first weeks of the year.\" He further elaborated on the potential ripple effects on the broader digital asset market, suggesting that altcoins, particularly those with smart contract capabilities, are poised for significant growth due to their innovative use cases and smaller market capitalizations. This dynamic could result in altcoins outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum over the investment cycle, propelled by incremental investments."

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has crossed the $3,000 threshold for the first time since April 2022 yesterday. However, amidst the celebratory fireworks in the crypto community, Fred Krueger, a renowned Bitcoin ETF expert, has voiced a starkly contrasting opinion. Krueger, a Wall Street veteran and prop trader, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his skepticism about the current valuation of ETH, stating, \u201cETH is completely detached from reality.\u201d\n\nWhy Ethereum Is \u201cCompletely Detached From Reality\u201d\n\nKrueger\u2019s comments come at a time when the crypto market is witnessing a resurgence in investor interest, with Ethereum at the forefront due to its recent price rally. Despite this, Krueger points out a concerning trend in the usage of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\n\u201cETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K active daily users in 2021, to just 66K over the last year. The top app, Uniswap V3 is only getting 16K DAUs. I remember, back in 2020 this number was 60K or more,\u201d he noted, emphasizing a decline in the platform\u2019s direct utility and engagement.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Receives Nod Of Approval From Berstein: ETH Price Will Reach $10,000 7 months ago\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF expert further criticized the valuation of Ethereum, drawing parallels to meme coins like Shiba Inu due to its inflated market cap, which stands at $361 billion despite the fall in active users. \u201cIt really has become a type of meme coin, similar to Shiba Inu,\u201d Krueger remarked, pointing to the stark contrast between Ethereum\u2019s high market cap and its diminishing direct use.\n\nKrueger argues that Ethereum is not only overvalued but also faces stiff competition from other blockchains that outperform it in terms of transaction costs and speed. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly cheap ($1.50 per transaction), or fast. If you are just interested in reward points for games, or casino-style DeFi apps \u2014 Solana, Avalanche, Near etc.. all crush it.\u201d\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism about the future regulatory landscape for Ethereum, particularly concerning the potential for an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cFinally, I don\u2019t think Gensler is going to allow an ETH ETF\u2026 I just don\u2019t think Gary wants to make his second ETF a massive pre-mine. Sets a very bad precedent,\u201d he stated, reflecting on the challenges Ethereum faces in gaining mainstream financial acceptance.\n\nThe Crypto Community Reacts\n\nIn response to Krueger\u2019s critical take, the crypto community on X provided mixed reactions. One user challenged Krueger\u2019s analysis by pointing to Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap and the misleading nature of using mainnet daily active users (DAU) as a metric for the platform\u2019s health. Krueger, however, remained unconvinced, stating, \u201cEven L2s like Arbitrum have been in decline for the last 12 months. This is not the case that all is well in ETH-land.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnother user attempted to highlight the cyclical nature of DeFi and the broader crypto market, suggesting that the current downturn is a temporary phase of risk aversion. Yet, Krueger dismissed these arguments, reiterating his lack of interest in speculative DeFi activities and emphasizing his belief in Bitcoin as the true revolutionary cryptocurrency. \u201cI am not interested in degen ape games. Have fun,\u201d he stated.\n\nKrueger\u2019s critique extends beyond Ethereum to the broader landscape of cryptocurrencies, questioning the long-term viability and value proposition of altcoins, including Layer 1 solutions other than Bitcoin. He argues that these platforms are unlikely to become significant value generators in the long term, likening their control mechanisms to fiat currencies but with central figures like Vitalik Buterin in place of traditional central bankers.\n\nKrueger\u2019s overall stance on Ethereum and the broader crypto market is clear. \u201cMy position on ETH. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is the revolution\u2026 Every other cryptocurrency is fighting for some other much smaller use case,\u201d he explained, underscoring his belief in Bitcoin\u2019s unique value proposition as a decentralized, finite currency system.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price surpassed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (at $2,922), trading at $2,935. A weekly close above this threshold could confirm another leg up for the ETH price.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Amid a bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency sector, which has pushed its representative asset, Bitcoin (BTC), over the $50,000 price threshold, things have been going great for the largest altcoin by market capitalization \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 and investors are wondering if five figures could be in store this year.\n\nAs it happens, the recent market optimism has pushed Ethereum closer to the psychologically important price level of $3,000, and breaking through this barrier could give it enough strength to continue further, possibly making a new all-time high (ATH) and perhaps even ending up in the $10,000 range.\n\nWill Ethereum hit $10,000?\n\nThat said, such a significant price increase would not be possible without other important factors falling into place, including the upcoming launch of Proto-Danksharding, as observed by Simon Dedic, the CEO of blockchain advisory and investment firm Moonrock Capital, on February 20.\n\nSpecifically, proto-danksharding, a.k.a proposal EIP-4844, which should launch in mid-March 2024, refers to a new type of transaction on Ethereum that accepts \u2018blobs\u2019 of data to persist in the beacon node for a short period of time, with blobs \u201csmall enough to keep disk use manageable,\u201d according to the team.\n\nAt @EthereumDenver we hacked together a full data-blob-transaction prototype! (a.k.a. mini-danksharding)\n\n\n\nData blobs are the first milestone towards full ethereum sharding, enabling rollups like @optimismPBC to grow 100x in capacity.\n\n\n\nHere's a tweet thread about the prototype \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) February 20, 2022\n\nOn top of that, the network is looking at a possible approval of its spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, which would lead to massive inflows and possibly contribute to an increase in the price of its native token.\n\nFurthermore, Dedic stressed the launch of EigenLayer and re-staking, which will \u201ctake a ton of ETH supply out of circulation,\u201d thanks to allowing users to use their staked ETH as cryptoeconomic security for protocols other than Ethereum, in exchange for protocol fees and rewards,\u201d the team said.\n\nFinally, the Moonrock Capital CEO highlighted Ethereum\u2019s deflationary tokenomics (its value increases due to a reduction or stagnation in supply) and the possible non-fungible token (NFT) craze coming back at some point with the return of the \u201cmainstream mania.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, he believes that Ethereum, out of all blue chips, is best positioned for the next two years \u201cin terms of supply/demand ratio given the future supply sinks and reflexivity\u201d and \u201c5 digits is programmed imo,\u201d Dedic said, referring to the possibility of Ethereum hitting $10,000.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price today is currently trading at $2,934.6, up 0.68% in the last 24 hours, as well as gaining 8.15% across the previous seven days, and adding up to the accumulated increase of 21.87% on its monthly chart, as per the most recent ETH price data retrieved on February 21.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, Ethereum is in a great position to significantly increase its price in 2024 and perhaps even reach a new ATH. However, $10,000 might be overly optimistic for this year, and even an ETH bull like Dedic gives it a two-year window for five figures to enter the narrative.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Global asset management firm, Bernstein has expressed confidence, foreseeing a fairly strong chance of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving an Ethereum Spot ETF.\n\nSEC Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Imminent\n\nIn a February 19 research report, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra disclosed that Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, may be the only digital asset after Bitcoin, to win an ETF approval from the US SEC.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Open Interest Reaches $69,000 ATH Levels, What This Means For Price 7 months ago\n\nFollowing the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETF, many crypto enthusiasts anticipated Ethereum as the next in line for an ETF. However, given the SEC\u2019s current stance on cryptocurrencies and its previous reluctant acceptance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the prospects of an Ethereum ETF have become uncertain.\n\nIn the research report, Bernstein analysts predicted the approval timeline for an Ethereum Spot ETF. They emphasized that the presence of notable traditional financial firms, including Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, competing for a Spot Ethereum ETF, strengthens the outlook for its approval.\n\n\u201cWe think there is a roughly 50% chance of spot Ethereum ETF approval by May, with an almost certain chance of approval within the next 12 months,\u201d the Bernstein report read.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Roadmap To $10,000\n\nWith the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, Ethereum may witness a significant price increase to levels as high as $10,000. Prior to the SEC\u2019s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10, the anticipation surrounding the ETF had sparked a massive price rally for the cryptocurrency. Following the approval and ETF launch, Bitcoin surged to over $45,000 before witnessing a subsequent price correction that pushed it back below $40,000.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Analyst Reveals Why Shiba Inu Price Will Not Reach $1 7 months ago\n\nDespite the short correction, Bitcoin has been gaining back its momentum, and at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $51,998, according to CoinMarketCap. This substantial price increase is largely attributed to the success of its ETF, providing investors with greater accessibility to Bitcoin, and contributing to the cryptocurrency\u2019s increased adoption.\n\nA similar narrative could unfold for Ethereum following the approval of its ETF. With rising interest from institutional investors and the ETF driving global adoption, the cryptocurrency could potentially attain new all-time highs above $10,000.\n\nIn the research report, Bernstein analysts also confirmed Ethereum\u2019s strong positioning for mainstream institutional adoption. The analysts emphasized the need for the cryptocurrency market to shift its attention to Ethereum, as the cryptocurrency is poised to witness gains following the approval and launch of its ETF.\n\nETH price reclaims $2,900 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Crypto Briefing, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "The Merge NFT: Ethereum Collection That Raised $90,000,000+ - CoinCodex",
        "content": "The Merge NFT is a unique dynamic NFT collection that was created by a digital artist called Murat Pak and featured on the leading NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in December 2021.\n\nThe collection that commemorates Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism netted over $91.8 million during its brief 48-hour sale. This makes The Merge not only the most expensive NFT collection ever sold, but also the most expensive art piece sold by a living artist on a public sale.\n\nThe artwork that accompanied The Merge NFT drop on Nifty Gateway. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is The Merge NFT and how does it work?\n\nThe Merge is a unique and dynamic Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) collection that made headlines and broke sales records in December 2021. After the sale was concluded, Nifty Gateway minted all 312,686 purchased tokens, also referred to as units of \u201cmass\u201d.\n\nWe're kicking off minting of mass tonight, anyone who purchased mass should see their NFT within the next few hours. We will also be putting a hold on moving mass out of your accounts momentarily to make the secondary market fair for everyone \u26ab\ufe0f @muratpak pic.twitter.com/bkdXu4uFFU \u2014 Nifty Gateway ? (@niftygateway) December 7, 2021\n\nThe artworks of The Merge NFTs are very basic as each token is represented by a simple white or yellow circle on a black background. The visuals are generated fully on-chain based on the formulas included in the smart contracts and not hosted off-chain as is the case with many other NFT collections.\n\nWhat sets The Merge apart from all other NFT collections is the concept behind the collection, which utilizes a unique mechanism that causes the collection to change and develop over time. The collection\u2019s smart contract prevents one address from holding multiple NFTs from the Merge collections \u2013 as soon as two NFTs from the collection are held in the same wallet, the masses of the two tokens merge. The result is one newly minted NFT with the combined mass of both pre-existing NFTs, which is depicted by a bigger circle on a black background.\n\nThe Merge NFTs in circulation diminishes as they are transferred between wallets (more precisely, bought by someone who already holds an NFT from the collection in the wallet), and their average mass increases. The total mass, however, remains constant.\n\nAn illustrative artwork depicting the merging of two mass tokens on the left and an equation explaining how the merging principle works on the right. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Merge?\n\nAs already mentioned, The Merge NFT collection commemorates the Ethereum Merge, which was a historical event in Ethereum\u2019s history that concluded the network's transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThe transition process started with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the Serenity upgrade, on December 1, 2021, when the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain (the chain that currently acts as the central coordination layer for the entire Ethereum 2.0 network) was activated. While ETH 2.0 staking deposits were enabled shortly after, the PoS and the PoW networks ran simultaneously up until September 15, 2022, when the transition concluded with The Merge event. Since then, the Ethereum network is secured solely by staking.\n\nThe move to proof-of-stake enabled Ethereum to address its scalability issues, which often caused extraordinary spikes in gas prices while the network still relied on PoW. In addition, the network had become more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable as the energy consumption was reduced by more than 99% when the PoW chain was made obsolete.\n\nHow much money The Merge NFT sold for in December 2021?\n\nThe Merge NFTs were sold in an open edition style (the opposite of a limited edition sale) from December 2 to December 4, 2021. The starting price for the public sale of The Merge tokens was set at $575 per unit, with the price increasing by $25 every 6 hours, so the ones who bought the tokens in the last few hours of the sale had to cash out $750 per token. The number of tokens each participant could acquire was unlimited.\n\nThe Merge NFT sale saw participation from 29,983 unique address owners who bought a total of 312,686 tokens. The Merge NFT sale ended up netting an exceptional sum of $91.8 million. This crowns The Merge NFT as the most expensive artwork ever publicly sold by a living artist.\n\nNevertheless, this record is a bit controversial as it is only valid if we consider the whole collection as a single piece of art. While many claim that The Merge is actually a collection of artworks, it could one day, if all the NFTs are merged in one wallet, become one NFT and thereby one single unique art piece.\n\nHow much is The Merge NFT worth now?\n\nSince its initial sale, the price of The Merge NFTs has fallen significantly. At the time of writing, one unit of mass has a floor price of $125, which is about 0.0428 ETH. Using this floor price puts the total market capitalization of the NFTs in circulation at slightly below 803 ETH (worth around $2.3 million).\n\nStill, quite a few tokens get sold above the floor price, which means that the total value of the whole collection would likely be higher in the end. In addition, the price of an NFT from The Merge collection also depends on its mass. There are currently 8,210 unique addresses that are holding The Merge NFT, meaning that there are only that many distinctive NFTs in circulation and many of them have a mass larger than 1.\n\nTop 4 The Merge NFTs with the largest mass that are currently being sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT marketplace and their respectful ask prices. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nThe Merge: Regenesis NFTs by ConsenSys\n\nPak's Merge collection is not the only NFT collection that pays tribute to the Ethereum merge. Ethereum development studio ConsenSys has released a collection called The Merge: Regenesis, which was also designed to celebrate Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe collection was available for minting over a period of 72 hours and features three types of artworks, each commemorating one aspect of Ethereum's move to PoS: scalability, security and sustainability.\n\nDue to the sheer amount of NFTs minted, this collection has a very low floor price of only about 0.0007 ETH ($2.05 at the time of writing).\n\nThe bottom line: The Merge is the most expensive NFT collection ever sold\n\nAlthough The Merge NFT collection is not as valuable as it used to be when it was initially dropped on the Nifty Gateway marketplace, the sale of this unique dynamic NFT collection still represents a record-breaking event in the history of digital art and art in general. The Merge NFT collection sold for $91.8 million, surpassed Jeff Koons\u2019 sculpture titled \u201cRabbit,\u201d which sold for $91.1 million by a hair's breadth and became arguably the most expensive artwork sold publicly by a living artist.\n\nIn addition, The Merge NFT reigns on top of the list of the most expensive NFT collections. Even so, The Merge tokens have not made it to the list of the most expensive single NFTs ever sold just yet. Interesting and unique NFTs from collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example, have a tendency to soar much higher as far as the price of a single non-fungible token is concerned.\n\nWe will conclude this article with a hard snap back to reality as those of us without ETH holdings worth millions of dollars in our digital wallets would likely find an article on how to find and participate in free NFT drops much more useful."

        "title": "Ethereum Leads AI Crypto Surge Ahead of Dencun Upgrade - West Island Blog",
        "content": "In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, seasoned crypto analyst Miles Deutscher has cast a spotlight on a group of alternative coins, with AI-powered tokens garnering particular emphasis due to their potential for significant gains amidst the market\u2019s resurgence. The discussion around Ethereum\u2019s anticipated Dencun upgrade has intensified expectations, suggesting a catalyst for substantial price escalation across AI-related cryptos.\n\nPositioned at the forefront of this potential financial upheaval is Ethereum (ETH), which has been quietly yet consistently gaining strength against its cryptocurrency counterpart Bitcoin (BTC). Attention within the investment community may have been fixated on the volatile Bitcoin movements and the progress of ETFs; however, ETH\u2019s relative stability and current price trend above $2,900 suggest a currency braced for a powerful upward swing. The increment comes at a crucial moment, with May fast approaching and the investment world holding its breath for the possible ramifications of ETF decisions.\n\nTRUSTED PARTNER \u2705\n\nAltcoins, especially those centered around artificial intelligence, have soared, capturing the imagination of investors and tech aficionados alike. Deutscher has been particularly vocal about coins such as AGIX, FET, WLD, and RNDR, which have exhibited bullish trends alongside the groundbreaking progress within the AI sector. The anticipation of an earnings report from the tech giant NVIDIA is yet another factor poised to infuse additional enthusiasm for AI coins.\n\nExploring further within Deutscher\u2019s treasure trove of potential, tokens like BLUR have displayed formidable vigor in the marketplace, tantalizingly close to breaching the dollar threshold amid rumors of significant forthcoming announcements. The allure is only magnified by the connections to projects such as BLAST, augmenting the speculative excitement. In a similar vein, BEAM stands out with Deutscher pointing to its treasury\u2019s substantial MAVIA holdings as a source of untapped value, a situation only underscored by recent interest from investment entities like Pantera.\n\nWith the debut of tokens such as STRK imminent, Deutscher notes the typical surge of investor activity that new launches provoke. The markets will undoubtably scrutinize its entry, as the initial response to airdrop sellers can greatly sway the token\u2019s valuation trajectory. Similarly, SEI\u2019s proximity to all-time highs, bolstered by an engaged development team and influential endorsements, indicates a prevailing confidence in its continued ascent.\n\nMAVIA, for its part, echoes the early excitement seen with platforms like Axie. Despite a strong initial showing, Deutscher suggests MAVIA could present as an opportune dip-buy investment given the right market conditions.\n\nAs the industry stands on the precipice of potentially transformative developments, Deutscher\u2019s keen insights offer a map to the territories that might soon witness considerable growth, thanks to infrastructural enhancements like the ETH Dencun upgrade and the groundbreaking progress in AI technology. The dynamic nature of the market ensures that opportunities for lucrative investment are ever-present, yet always fluctuating, urging a vigilant eye on the shifting crypto landscape."
