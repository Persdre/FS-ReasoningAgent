        "title": "Spot Ether ETFs Could Introduce New Concentration Risk in Ethereum: S&P Global - Unchained",
        "content": "An increase in ether staking ETFs could affect Ethereum\u2019s validator mix, and potentially increase the network\u2019s concentration risk, say analysts from S&P Global.\n\nS&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators, and potentially increase the network's concentration risk.\n\nUS ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be approved as early as May this year, but certain funds with staking functionality could introduce new concentration risks for the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 report, analysts at S&P Global said that an increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism.\n\nThe S&P analysts, Andrew O\u2019Neill and Alexandre Birry, noted that while the participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the decentralized staking protocol Lido, it could also introduce new concentration risk if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs.\n\nLido is the largest Ethereum validator with $29.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. Industry watchers have often pointed to the staking provider\u2019s dominance in the liquid token staking market as a concern, arguing that Lido\u2019s 31% market share presents a significant centralization threat to Ethereum.\n\nHowever, Marin Tvrdi\u0107, the protocol relations contributor for Lido, explained in an interview with CoinDesk last year that neither the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO,) nor the protocol itself, holds custody of users\u2019 ether, or staked ether.\n\n\u201cAt no point is it a custodial solution,\u201d Tvrdi\u0107 said. \u201cAt every single point in time, from the moment ether enters the protocol and gets deposited on a validator, it\u2019s self-custodial.\u201d\n\nS&P\u2019s O\u2019Neill and Birry believe that spot ether staking ETF issuers are unlikely to choose decentralized protocols like Lido, but rather an institutional crypto custodian.\n\n\u201cCoinbase acts as a custodian in eight of the 11 recently approved U.S. bitcoin ETFs and is named as a staking institution by three of the four largest ether staking ETFs outside the U.S,\u201d they noted.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. spot ether ETFs on concentration risk, be it positive or negative, could be significant, which makes constant monitoring of concentration risk even more important,\u201d they said.\n\nCurrently, there are eight spot ether ETFs being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and 21Shares, Grayscale Investments, BlackRock, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco and most recently, Franklin Templeton."

        "title": "Is Ethereum Fulfilling Its Potential as an Incredible Disruptor? 3 Reasons I'm Bearish - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This innovative crypto gets a lot of attention, but investors need to ask pressing questions.\n\nEthereum (ETH -0.92%) was born from the perceived limitations to adding functionality to Bitcoin. Launched in July 2015, Ethereum has skyrocketed nearly 93,000% in value since its public release, even though it remains more than 40% off its peak price.\n\nIs the world's second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a current market cap of about $350 billion, fulfilling its potential as an incredible disruptor? I'm not so sure. Here are three reasons I'm bearish on Ethereum.\n\nHuge promise\n\nLet's first try to understand why there's so much hype surrounding Ethereum and its long-term potential. Thanks to the blockchain network having functionality for smart contracts, many bulls believe that Ethereum can disrupt numerous industries, particularly those that depend on expensive intermediaries, by giving power and value back to the users.\n\nIn other words, smart contracts can automate a lot of functions that are slow and cumbersome, and that might not add much value. The end result, as many hope, is a better and cheaper user experience.\n\nViewed in this light, it might be encouraging to see Ethereum's complex roadmap. With scalability, security, and sustainably as the top priorities, the network's developer community has laid out different sets of upgrades to accomplish certain milestones. The latest event, known as The Merge, changed Ethereum to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, significantly reducing its energy usage.\n\nViewed as the world's decentralized computer, Ethereum's ultimate goal is to change the entire structure of the economy, mainly as it relates to how individuals can have greater control in an internet-enabled world.\n\nReasons to be skeptical\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in Ethereum's promise. There are more than 250 million unique wallet addresses. It has the most total value locked by far of any other crypto, which measures the amount of assets locked in a specific DeFi protocol. And sure, there are thousands of decentralized applications.\n\nBut I view things with a critical perspective. I think Ethereum is still primarily used as a tool for financial speculation, not actual utility. Even if spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds get approved, it proves that investors only want price exposure, instead of using Ethereum tokens in some dApp setting.\n\nAnd are dApps really better than services provided by well-known businesses? Marketplace and platform-like businesses, such as Meta Platforms, PayPal, Uber, and Airbnb, have billions of users combined who find value in what they have to offer. They work just fine as is.\n\nAnother reason I'm bearish is that I view Ethereum as another venture start-up, which defeats the entire purpose of crypto aiming to be decentralized and give power to the people. There are still a few head developers, most notably Vitalik Buterin, who have outsized influence on the direction of the network. And these founders stand to gain the most financially should things work out as planned.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said that Bitcoin is the only crypto that's a commodity, and that others are essentially securities. This supports the argument that Ethereum is just another profit-seeking enterprise.\n\nAnd the last bear case rests on the belief that Ethereum is a solution looking for a problem. In fact, this is probably true for nearly all cryptocurrencies right now.\n\nAll of the focus and discussion centered on the complex technicalities of the underlying network sound exciting. However, one really has to question if more and more people will engage further with Ethereum and use its dApps in the future. I'm not confident in this outcome.\n\nIt might make some bullish Ethereum supporters uncomfortable to challenge their beliefs about the cryptocurrency. But I think healthy criticality is necessary to set realistic expectations about its future."

        "content": "The potential approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, which includes plans for staking, might amplify concentration risks within the Ethereum network, S&P Global Ratings highlighted in a recent analysis.\n\nAccording to the report, the SEC could approve ETH ETFs as early as May. However, as financial heavyweights vie for a stake in this emerging sector, the entry of ETFs could significantly sway the balance of validator power in Ethereum, posing new challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe SEC has to decide on VanEck\u2019s application by May 23 and could rule on other ETH ETF applications by that deadline.\n\nConcentration risks\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF proposals from Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton aim to generate additional yield by staking ETH. However, if those staking-enabled ETFs see sufficiently high inflows, they could impact participation rates in Ethereum\u2019s validation network, S&P Global analysts wrote.\n\nAccording to the report, Lido currently accounts for a little under one-third of staked ETH and is the largest Ethereum validator. However, the report casts doubt on the likelihood of these ETFs opting for decentralized staking protocols such as Lido.\n\nInstead, a preference for institutional crypto custodians seems more probable, suggesting a different impact on validator concentration depending on the diversification strategies of issuers.\n\nThe report also highlighted that Coinbase \u2014 which serves as a custodian for some funds \u2014 could also pose a concentration risk if it takes in new ETH on behalf of US ETFs.\n\nThe exchange is currently responsible for roughly 15% of staked ETH, making it the second-largest validator overall. It also serves as the custodian for three of the four largest non-US staking Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThe report said these issues are critical because reliance on a single entity or software client can introduce risks of validator outages and attacks. It called for greater monitoring of concentration risk and emphasized its importance.\n\nThe emergence of new digital asset custodians could offer a pathway for ETF issuers to distribute their stakes more broadly, which could also mitigate concentration risk.\n\nJP Morgan echoes concerns\n\nS&P Global\u2019s report echoes the concerns raised by JP Morgan regarding concentration risks in the Ethereum staking ecosystem in October 2023. The lender\u2019s report also concluded that the dominance of Lido and Coinbase poses significant concentration risks to the ecosystem.\n\nJP Morgan argued that a concentrated number of validators could become a single point of failure, jeopardizing the network\u2019s stability and security. Such centralization also presents lucrative targets for malicious attacks, ranging from hacking attempts to coordinated disruptions of network operations.\n\nAdditionally, the analysts at JPMorgan cautioned against the potential for collusion among major validators. An oligopoly of validators could manipulate the network\u2019s governance and operational parameters to their advantage at the expense of Ethereum\u2019s broader user base.\n\nThis could manifest in censoring transactions, engaging in preferential treatment of certain operations, or front-running \u2014 practices that would erode trust in Ethereum\u2019s fairness and transparency.\n\nEnsuring that Ethereum remains a robust, secure, and decentralized platform requires a collective effort to mitigate concentration risks and to foster an environment where no single validator or group of validators can wield disproportionate power.\n\n**Editor\u2019s Note: Updated to fix inaccuracies about the JP Morgan report.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nToday hasn\u2019t been the best day for Bitcoin and Ethereum traders. Markets in general\u2014crypto and securities\u2014closed in the red yesterday while investors cautiously waited for hints at what the U.S. Federal Reserve will decide at its next FOMC meeting.\n\nTomorrow the U.S. will release new data on unemployment claims and January home sales\u2014two criteria that could weigh heavily on the Fed\u2019s upcoming decisions on interest rates. Generally speaking, stocks and digital assets tend to thrive when the Fed lowers rates. And neither crypto nor securities markets like the uncertainty of not knowing what the FOMC will do next.\n\nThe Dow Jones index fell 0.17%, closing at 38,563.80 points; the S&P 500 fell 0.60%, registering 4,975.51 points; and the Nasdaq had a more expressive fall, closing the day at 15,630.78 points, for a decrease of 0.92%.\n\nAnd crypto is mimicking Wall Street. Bitcoin commenced the trading day at $52,272, embarking on a downward trajectory that saw it touch a low of $50,611. The leading digital currency is currently trading at $51,162, representing a 2% decline over the past day. This downturn marks what could be the most significant decline since January 22, absent a recovery.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nDespite today's drop, the overall sentiment for Bitcoin has been bullish throughout 2024.\n\nThe cryptocurrency managed to breach the $50,000 mark, largely driven by the demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs. However, it has been trading sideways since February 15, suggesting a potential cooling off of bullish momentum.\n\nA critical support level for Bitcoin is identified around the $51,000 mark, correlating with the EMA 10, or 10-day exponential moving average. Notably, Bitcoin has not closed below this level since January 25.\n\nPresently, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicates Bitcoin is overbought, with a value nearing 70, suggesting a potential shift towards market equilibrium as investors might begin selling BTC to realize profits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum's Response to Market Dynamics\n\nEthereum seems to be mirroring Bitcoin's immediate market response.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization faced rejection at the $3,000 mark, a notable psychological barrier, subsequently retracting by 3.2% to a daily nadir of $2,880. Following this, Ethereum managed a modest recovery to $2,900.\n\nImage: Tradingview\n\nContrasting with Bitcoin's sideways movement, Ethereum has maintained a bullish stance throughout February, consistently navigating within an upward trajectory.\n\nThis resilience underscores Ethereum's robust market sentiment, marked by fundamental factors that have set high expectations among traders: an upcoming network upgrade, a sustained increase in DeFi activity that\u2019s more than doubled to $45 billion since october 2023, and even rumors of a possible spot Ethereum ETF being approved in the future.\n\nEthereum is presently positioned closer to its support level at $2,800, determined by its 10-day average price, rather than facing immediate resistance. Should Ethereum manage a recovery and sustain its bullish trend, the next significant resistance is anticipated near the $3,500 mark.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "title": "First Bitcoin, now Ethereum. Analysts see four drivers behind an even bigger surge - DLNews",
        "content": "With the Bitcoin ETF dust settled, analysts are now turning to Ethereum.\n\nSeveral key catalysts could see Ether outperform Bitcoin this next cycle.\n\nOnchain activity is already on the rise, specifically for stablecoins built on Ethereum.\n\nThe immensely successful launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the US is setting the stage for a new wave of speculation.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s all eyes on Ethereum.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has a good chance of approving Ethereum spot ETFs in May, analysts told DL News.\n\nThat\u2019s not the second-most valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s only tailwind, either.\n\nSEC\u2019s next ETF hurdle\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs now out of the gate, analysts are turning their attention to Ethereum and its slew of catalysts.\n\nAt the top of the list: The SEC might greenlight a slew of Ethereum spot ETFs in May. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other Bitcoin spot ETF issuers have already filed applications to launch such products.\n\n\u201cWhile the Ethereum ETF isn\u2019t as much of a guaranteed approval as the Bitcoin ETF, the market has now gotten a taste of what to expect when it is approved,\u201d Quinn Thompson, head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told DL News.\n\nOver $10 billion has already flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, excluding Grayscale\u2019s fund, which already existed prior to its conversion into an ETF. The action has helped buttress Bitcoin\u2019s hefty 21% rally since the year\u2019s start.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cGiven Ethereum\u2019s smaller market cap and liquidity, a similar or lesser amount of flows would have an even bigger impact on Ethereum\u2019s price,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThe market will begin to reprice this possibility higher over the next one to two months ahead of more clarity from the SEC.\u201d\n\nBrian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told DL News he saw the odds of Ethereum ETFs being approved at roughly 66%.\n\n\u201cThe experts I\u2019m seeing give May approval odds between sub-50% to 70%,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone, however, thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time, since Ethereum futures-based ETFs exist already \u2014 if denied in May, the SEC will get sued, and approval moves to 2025.\u201d\n\nUsers of the crypto-powered prediction site Polymarket price approval odds at 47%.\n\nThe deadline for approval is May 23, says Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. That\u2019s the final deadline for VanEck\u2019s application.\n\nThe SEC will likely want to greenlight all applications at the same time, just as it did for Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nSeyffart and fellow Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said last year that the agency wanted to avoid being a \u201ckingmaker\u201d by approving a fund ahead of others \u2014 like when it allowed ProShares to launch its Bitcoin futures ETF before anyone else.\n\nDencun, EigenLayer and Ethereum\u2019s burn\n\nEthereum has three other tailwinds, too.\n\nScheduled for March 13, the Dencun upgrade \u2014 designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 solutions \u2014 is Ethereum\u2019s most significant upgrade since Shapella, which allowed stakers to finally withdraw their ETH from the network.\n\n\u201cLayer 2s are a vital component of Ethereum\u2019s future success,\u201d CCData research lead Joshua de Vos told DL News. \u201cImproving their scalability and cost-effectiveness is going to enhance the attractiveness of Ethereum compared to competing layer 1s such as Solana.\u201d\n\nThe rise of restaking protocols such as EigenLayer is another reason traders may flock to Ethereum, Rudick pointed out.\n\nAnd stablecoin growth on the network is an indication that activity was ready to pick back up, Thompson argued. Ethereum stablecoin supply is up 4.4% since January 1, from $68 billion to $71 billion, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nFinally, Ethereum\u2019s monetary policy may also play to the bulls. Vigorous onchain activity means the network burns even more Ethereum per transaction. If this destruction outpaces issuance \u2014 or how much new Ethereum enters the market \u2014 it can create a deflationary dynamic.\n\nSince February 8, for example, there has already been more Ether destroyed than created, per data from ultrasound.money.\n\n\u201cIn a bull market where onchain activity is increasing, stablecoin supply growing and user adoption scaling at a higher pace, Ethereum is positioned to outperform Bitcoin given its more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $51,217.\n\nEthereum is trading flat over the same period, now at $2,912.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

According to crypto news and analytics site TheBlock.com, the volume of such securities that day reached nearly $2.6 billion.\n\nInvestors like spot Bitcoin ETFs because they provide near-direct exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of having to manage it. This typically involves opening, funding, and maintaining a specialized crypto trading account and handling the often wonky particulars of digital wallet management. With a spot Bitcoin ETF, all an interested investor needs to do is buy shares through a traditional brokerage.\n\nAs a group, cryptos also tend to wane when there's hot action in other types of securities. Wednesday was all about tech stocks -- remember those? Much of the investment world was focused particularly on the latest quarterly report published after market hours Wednesday by graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (spoiler alert; the company did gangbusters in its fourth quarter, beating on both the top and bottom lines).\n\nWith much action in all manner of tech stocks in advance of that earnings release, it's likely that some crypto-holders did a little reallocating by shifting part of their funds from coins/tokens to tech equities.\n\nEthereum should soon get the spot ETF treatment, too\n\nNvidia is likely to stay the investment story for the rest of the week, and those spot Bitcoin ETFs sure aren't going anywhere. Considering that, there's more than a small chance this crypto correction could last for a few more days.\n\nAs usual in market downturns, though, that would open up opportunities for buying on the slump. Personally, I'll be holding on to my (admittedly tiny) Ethereum position, as that coin is almost certain to be the next digital asset getting the spot ETF treatment. Dogecoin is always somewhat of a dodgy investment given its continued lack of utility and its volatility, but utility plays like Optimism could rise along with the coming of spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ethereum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ethereum wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Ethereum spot ETFs may intensify validator concentration risk, says S&P Global - Crypto Briefing",
        "content": "The research focuses more on Coinbase as a potential risk factor due to its existing custodial role and potential to gain significant control through ETFs.\n\nShare this article\n\nSpot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), if approved, could intensify validator concentration risks within the Ethereum network, according to recent research from S&P Global.\n\nThe research, titled \u201cU.S. Ether ETFs Could Exacerbate Concentration Risk,\u201d sheds light on the potential impact of spot Ethereum funds on validator concentration on the Ethereum network, particularly those that incorporate staking.\n\n\u201cAn increase in ether staking ETFs could affect the mix of validators participating in the Ethereum network\u2019s consensus mechanism. The participation of institutional custodians could reduce the current concentration on the Lido decentralized staking protocol. However, it may also introduce new concentration risk, particularly if a single entity is chosen to stake the bulk of ether included in these ETFs,\u201d stated the analysis.\n\nTraditional spot traded products like spot Bitcoin ETFs secure their holdings in digital vaults, with their primary function being to mirror the asset\u2019s market price. However, Ethereum\u2019s unique proposition lies in staking \u2013 where crypto is locked up to support network operations and secure transactions, rewarding participants in the process. Despite potential rewards, staking introduces the risk of \u2018slashing\u2019 if validators underperform or act maliciously.\n\nAccording to the research, spot Ethereum ETFs won\u2019t affect the validator mix, but the proposed staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs, such as those of Ark Invest and Franklin Templeton, could become large enough to significantly influence validator power.\n\n\u201cSpot ether ETFs that simply hold ether will not affect the validator mix in Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism. Spot ether ETFs that include staking, however, will do exactly that\u2013at least if inflows are high enough,\u201d added the analysis. \u201cU.S. spot ether ETFs that incorporate staking could become large enough to change validator concentrations in the Ethereum network, for better or worse.\u201d\n\nS&P Global\u2019s analysis also highlights specific concerns around Lido and Coinbase. Both entities are potential threats to validator concentration but for slightly different reasons.\n\nThe research notes that while Lido holds nearly 33% of staked ETH, it\u2019s unlikely that US institutions launching Ethereum staking ETFs will directly engage with Lido due to regulatory and risk considerations. Instead, these ETFs might opt for regulated digital asset custodians for staking, potentially mitigating Lido\u2019s dominance. However, this shift raises concerns about the role of Coinbase.\n\nThe research warns that Coinbase, a major exchange with significant validator control, could increase its Ethereum stake through ETFs, leading to greater concentration. Furthermore, Coinbase\u2019s dual role as custodian for multiple Bitcoin ETFs and potential involvement in Ethereum ETFs could exacerbate concentration.\n\nHowever, the overall impact of ETFs on concentration depends on their staking practices. The research suggests that the introduction of new digital asset custodians could allow ETF issuers to diversify their stakes across different entities, potentially mitigating concentration risk."

        "content": "On Feb. 20, Solana TVL surpassed $2 billion for the first time in 2 years, and funds flowing in from Ethereum through the Wormhole bridge suggest more SOL price gains ahead.\n\nSOL\u2018s price has lost steam after soaring to a new 2024 peak of $118.40 on Feb. 15. However, an on-chain data trail of funds inflows trickling down to Solana from the Ethereum (ETH) network this week could spark a SOL price rebound toward $150.\n\nSolana price dips 12%, falling below market average\n\nIn the first half of February 2024, Solana was at the forefront of the crypto market rally, with SOL price soaring 26.8% and adding nearly $11 billion to its market capitalization. But that market trend flipped on Feb. 15 as investors began to take profits once the SOL price reached the 2024 peak of $118.\n\nSolana (SOL) price performance vs. Total3 Altcoin Market Cap (Excluding BTC and ETH) | Source: TradingView\n\nAt press time on Feb. 21, Solana is trading at $103, down 12% from its Feb. 15 peaks.\n\nMeanwhile, in contrast, the total altcoin market has grown by 5% during that period. Solana\u2019s negative price performance seems driven by insiders and existing holders\u2019 booking profits rather than macro factors.\n\nSolana receives $25 million in inflows from Ethereum\n\nHowever, while some SOL traders are taking chips off the table, the Solana network has continued to make some giant strides this week, which could trigger an early price rebound.\n\nIn the past week, Solana has received significant inflows from Ethereum as investors increasingly look to leverage Solana\u2019s more efficient and cost-effective defi services.\n\nBetween Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, investors transferred funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum to Solana, per on-chain data from Wormhole bridge Explorer.\n\nFund Outflows Ethereum (ETH) to Solana (SOL), Feb. 13 \u2013 Feb. 21 | Source: Wormhole Bridge\n\nThis indicates that Solana continues gaining traction among developers and defi users due to its high throughput and low transaction costs. Hence, this rising flow of funds bridged into Solana-hosted decentralized applications (dApps) is a bullish indicator of its growing adoption and utility.\n\nSolana defi TVL hits $2 billion milestone\n\nInvestors transferring funds worth over $24.6 million from Ethereum into the Solana ecosystem, despite the 12% decline in Solana\u2019s price over the last seven days, shows an evident divergence between short-term price movements and long-term investor sentiment.\n\nSolana (SOL) Total Value Locked (TVL) hits $2 billion, Feb. 21, 2024 | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nThe latest wave of fund inflows has now propelled Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Solana network above the $2 billion milestone for the first time since June 2022.\n\nThis further underlines that the ongoing SOL price pullback is not driven by any discernible deterioration of Solana\u2019s fundamental network growth metrics.\n\nIf the trends persist, the rising demand for Solana defi service could eventually evolve into market demand for native SOL tokens and ultimately trigger a bullish price reversal towards the $150 territory in the coming weeks."

        "content": "Ether\u2019s trip to $3,000 may have been short-lived, but on-chain data and the state of the wider ecosystem suggests that there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the digital asset.\n\nEthereum\u2019s native token ether (ETH) hit a near two-year high ahead of $3,000 on Tuesday \u2013 the first time it has traded at this level since April 2022.\n\nThe second largest digital asset by market cap rallied over 12% in the last week and briefly changed hands at $3,031, according to data from CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, ether had failed to gain momentum towards a move higher, suggesting that this resistance level won\u2019t be so easy to breach.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this recent rally could also have some traders on their toes, given the last time ether rallied to this level in the weeks leading up to April 3, 2022. At the time, ether rallied from $2,520 over three weeks to a high of $3,580, but its price plummeted 46% over the next 40 days that followed.\n\nIn its most recent review of the crypto market, onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that while Bitcoin dominance still remains significant, there are early signs of more investor capital rotating into other ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cWe note that following the approval of the bitcoin ETF, ether has started to outperform bitcoin, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023,\u201d said the Glassnode analysts.\n\nIt is also likely that major inflows into ether will only materialize over the coming weeks, as they tend to lag relative to bitcoin inflows on account of investors looking for confirmation that digital asset markets are growing.\n\n\u201cIn the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into bitcoin occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ether,\u201d said Glassnode analysts.\n\nOptions market data suggests that a retest of some crucial price levels might come sooner rather than later. Coinalyze data points to more bullish bets on the price of ether, showing that 59% of traders were in long positions over a 24-hour time frame."

        "content": "Social media giant Reddit has been quietly buying Bitcoin and Ethereum with some of its excess cash and holds an undisclosed amount of the two tokens in its treasury for investment purposes.\n\nThe social media giant\u2019s crypto exposure details were revealed in its initial public offering (IPO) prospectus, which was filed with the SEC on Feb. 22. The filing comes after months of speculation about the company\u2019s plans to go public.\n\nThe company did not disclose how many shares it plans to sell or the price range for the offering. However, it is expected to be one of the largest tech IPOs of the year.\n\nCrypto exposure\n\nThe filing clarifies that Reddit\u2019s crypto holdings are confined to Bitcoin and Ethereum, both established players in the crypto space. The revelation was somewhat of a surprise, considering the company\u2019s cautious approach toward crypto in recent years.\n\nAccording to the document, Reddit\u2019s board of directors has approved the investment policy, which focuses on \u201crisk mitigation\u201d by only investing in cryptocurrencies deemed \u201cnot likely to be a security\u201d by regulatory bodies.\n\nThe filing did not disclose the amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum held in the treasury or how long the company has been buying them.\n\nWhile the disclosed crypto holdings are limited to treasury purposes, the filing also mentioned that Reddit had acquired Ether and Matic for virtual goods sales. It added that the amounts were \u201cimmaterial\u201d in recent years.\n\nThe filing acknowledges the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including volatility, cybersecurity threats, and potential regulatory changes. It also highlights the accounting challenges posed by treating cryptocurrencies as indefinite-lived intangible assets and the upcoming changes in accounting standards.\n\nDigital infrastructure\n\nReddit\u2019s IPO filing hinted at broader ambitions to integrate blockchain technology into its expansive network of forums and discussions. It described the platform\u2019s ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue streams and enhance its digital infrastructure, with cryptocurrencies playing a crucial role in this strategy.\n\nThe filing also mentioned exploring decentralized applications (dApps) and the potential for blockchain to offer new forms of content creation, sharing, and ownership. It also emphasized the potential of blockchain to enhance user experience and create new avenues for community engagement and monetization.\n\nReddit\u2019s IPO filing offers a glimpse into a social media giant cautiously embracing the world of cryptocurrencies. While the company\u2019s current exposure is limited, its openness to experimentation and focus on regulatory compliance suggests a potential for future growth and innovation in this space.\n\nMentioned in this article"

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAn Ethereum (ETH) whale has reportedly made a colossal investment, acquiring $166 million worth of ETH within just three days. According to a recent update from Spot On Chain, the anonymous investor has been actively purchasing large amounts of ETH, leveraging major platforms such as Binance and 1inch for their transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe details shared by Spot On Chain highlight that the whale's latest acquisition involved a hefty sum of 10.01 million USDT to purchase 3,413 ETH at an approximate rate of $2,933 per ETH around nine hours ago. This recent purchase is part of a larger buying spree, where the investor has cumulatively bought 58,134 ETH at an average price of around $2,850 per ETH in the past three days.\n\nThis giant whale spent another 10.01M $USDT to buy 3,413 $ETH at $2,933 ~9hrs ago.\n\n\n\nOverall, the whale has allegedly bought 58,134 $ETH via #Binance and #1icnh at ~$2,850 ($166M) in the past 3 days.\n\n\n\nThe whale still has 19.89M $USDT and may swap them for more $ETH!\n\n\n\nWhat will the\u2026 https://t.co/t2BYgtewmw pic.twitter.com/BzUAI5ja4e \u2014 Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 21, 2024\n\nAs the cryptocurrency community buzzes with speculation and intrigue, the whale's remaining balance of 19.89 million USDT suggests that this might not be the end of their market activities. There is a high possibility that they may continue to swap this remaining balance for more Ethereum, further influencing the market dynamics.\n\nEthereum price eyes further gains\n\nThe impact of such substantial transactions is not to be underestimated. The current market price of Ethereum stands at $2,919, showing a modest increase of 0.14% over the last 24 hours. More notably, ETH has seen a significant surge of 17.94% in the last 30 days, reflecting renewed interest and optimism in the cryptocurrency. Moreover, the Ethereum market is witnessing an overall uptick in activity.\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume for ETH has seen a substantial rise of 45.18%, now standing at $21.21 billion. This heightened activity suggests a robust and engaging market environment for Ethereum. Further insights from CoinGlass reveal an increase in the Open Interest in Ethereum by 1.02% over the last day, totaling $10.58 billion."

On-chain intelligence firm Santiment noted that traders bought Ethereum at the local top, above $3,000, out of the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).\n\nAlso read: XRP price suffers pullback with latest update in SEC v. Ripple lawsuit\n\nEthereum price crosses $3,000 yet again\n\nEthereum price has crossed the psychologically important $3,000 level several times this week, with no sustained continuation of the uptrend. ETH price has corrected briefly each time the altcoin revisits the $3,000 mark.\n\nOn-chain intelligence tracker Santiment identified the likely driver of the price rally to $3,000. Each time Ethereum price hit its local top, there was an increase in the mention of \u201c$3K,\u201d \u201cbuy,\u201d or \u201cbuying Ethereum\u201d in relation to ETH. This indicates there was an increase in FOMO among market participants and this resulted in traders buying ETH at the local top, above $3,000.\n\nThis also explains why Ethereum\u2019s run to $3,000 has been a short-lived trip each time.\n\nEthereum rallies to $3,000 yet again. Source: Santiment\n\nOther factors influencing Ethereum price are Bitcoin price trend, which is currently sideways below the $52,000 level and the anticipation surrounding the approval of a Spot Ethereum ETF. Bitcoin\u2019s price trend and the next move, a rally towards $53,000 or a correction towards the psychologically important $50,000 level, could determine where Ethereum price is headed next.\n\nAdditionally, the anticipation surrounding the Spot Ethereum ETF could die down soon and ETH price fails to sustain its recent gains.\n\nEthereum price could revisit 2024 peak on one condition\n\nEthereum price is in uptrend and the altcoin is currently trading close to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its rally to the 2024 top of $3.033.09, at $2,829.36. Ethereum price needs to hold steady above support to attempt another rally towards its yearly high.\n\nSustained buying pressure and positive momentum can help Ethereum price rally higher. The green bars on the Moving Average Convergence/ Divergence (MACD) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) suggest that there is positive momentum and Ethereum\u2019s uptrend is intact.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nIf Ethereum price closes below $2,829.36, it could result in a sweep of support at 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of $2,703.32 and even the 50% Fib retracement at $2,601.46 if the correction is steep. ETH price is likely to recoup its losses, rallying towards the $3,033.09 target post the correction."

        "title": "Ethereum Layer-2s About To Take Off, Says Coin Bureau\u2019s Guy Turner \u2013 Here Are His Top Picks - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "The host of the Coin Bureau YouTube channel, Guy Turner, is expressing bullish sentiment on Ethereum (ETH) layer-2 projects.\n\nIn a new strategy session, Turner tells the 2.41 million channel subscribers that ETH\u2019s Dencun update may cause layer-2 projects to go on massive rallies and he names his top four picks.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade, which is expected to roll out in March, aims to reduce costs for layer-2 transactions and data availability on the leading smart contract platform.\n\nSays Turner,\n\n\u201cAs the Dencun upgrade draws near, Ethereum\u2019s layer-2s are about to take off.\u201d\n\nFirst up, the trader says that Arbitrum (ARB) could maintain its upward momentum.\n\n\u201cARB recently hit an all-time high of $2.40 on the 12th of January, and hasn\u2019t really shown many signs of slowing down either in large part due to the anticipated effects of Dencun. This is because Dencun\u2019s impact on layer-2 transaction speeds and costs will likely see more and more people adopting Arbitrum as an even cheaper way of interacting with Ethereum.\u201d\n\nArbitrum is trading for $1.83 at time of writing, down 6% in the last 24 hours.\n\nNext up, the trader says Optimism (OP) has a lot of upward potential due to its aim to build a \u201csuperchain\u201d ecosystem that promotes collaboration across multiple layer-2 scaling solutions.\n\n\u201cOne of the first entrants to the \u2018superchain\u2019 ecosystem was none other than Coinbase\u2019s very own layer-2 solution, Base\u2026\n\nThis superchain could quickly become a reality after Dencun.\u201d\n\nOptimism is trading for $3.68 at time of writing, down more than 9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAnother scaling solution on the trader\u2019s radar is Immutable X (IMX), which he believes could become more popular in the GameFi industry.\n\n\u201cImmutable could see a rapid acceleration in blockchain gaming development as network efficiency is supercharged. With Immutable being positioned as a big player in the GameFi narrative, many more gaming developers will be turning their attention to the best environment to launch their products in, and Immutable will be a top contender in that regard.\u201d\n\nImmutable is trading for $3.33 at time of writing, down more than 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nLastly, the trader says Polygon (MATIC) could rise in value due to its own planned network upgrade called Polygon 2.0.\n\n\u201cMATIC hit an all-time high of $2.92 on the 27th of December 2021. At the time of shooting, it\u2019s still at 66% down from this price point. However, this could all change with 2.0.\u201d\n\nMATIC is trading for $0.93, down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStarkWare, the startup behind the Ethereum scaling network Starknet, announced Thursday that it will revise its STRK token allocation schedule for contributors and investors following backlash from the crypto community.\n\nThe company will spread out its allocations over the course of years rather than conducting a sizable planned STRK unlock this April. The price of STRK jumped following the announcement, according to CoinGecko, rising from $1.86 to $2.03 in a matter of minutes before settling to just under $2 as of this writing. The token is up 9% on the day.\n\nStarkWare had initially planned to unlock 1.3 billion STRK tokens for investors and early contributors on April 15, following this Tuesday's token launch. The short cliff had been controversial among Starknet users and across the broader crypto community, amid fears that such a sizable unlock (about 13% of the total STRK supply) could impact the token's price.\n\nUnder the revised plan, StarkWare will unlock 64 million tokens monthly for the first year starting April 15, and then 127 million tokens monthly for the 24 months thereafter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImportant update: After listening to feedback from ecosystem friends and collaborators, we are changing the lockup schedule for StarkWare\u2019s early contributors and investors to make it more gradual. We value this community and want to earn its trust by building great tech that\u2026 \u2014 StarkWare (@StarkWareLtd) February 22, 2024\n\nThis spreads out the token unlocks, with 580 million tokens set to unlock for contributors and investors by the end of 2024, with another 1.4 billion STRK unlocked in 2025 and a further 1.5 billion STRK set to unlock for those people in 2026.\n\nIn a tweet, StarkWare co-founder and CEO Eli Ben-Sasson wrote that his company \"listened to concerns re: long-term alignment of StarkWare w/ Starknet ecosystem,\" \"proposed a more gradual release schedule,\" \"[believes] trust is earned with actions, not just words,\" and \"[thanks] investors for their support on this.\"\n\nBen-Sasson had previously brushed off criticism over the token unlock schedule after the token launch plans were revealed last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe unlocking for the team and early investors\u2026 is one aspect in which we may be non-standard,\u201d Ben-Sasson told Decrypt last week. \u201cBut we build different and we view things a little bit differently.\u201d\n\nWe\n\n1. listened to concerns re. long-term alignment of @StarkWareLtd w/ Starknet ecosystem.\n\n2. proposed a more gradual release schedule\n\n3. believe trust is earned with actions, not just words\n\n4. thank investors for their support on this@StarkWareLtd \u2764\ufe0f @Starknet https://t.co/WZsiZsn3yM \u2014 Eli Ben-Sasson (@EliBenSasson) February 22, 2024\n\nStarknet's token launched this Tuesday with a massive airdrop to nearly 1.3 million eligible wallets, but the price fell sharply thereafter. It's currently down 55% from the peak price of $4.41 achieved on Tuesday, though it has rebounded from a low of $1.70 on Wednesday.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated with additional details after publication."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain sleuth @lookonchain has reported that a wallet that may belong to the founder of the Tron blockchain Justin Sun conducted another massive purchase of Ethereum within merely 30 minutes on Feb. 21.\n\nThe aforementioned cryptocurrency tracker revealed how much Ethereum Sun bought through this wallet in less than 10 days.\n\nJustin Sun's cumulative Ethereum purchases\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the founder of one of the largest cryptocurrencies, Tron (TRX), Justin Sun, made two massive Ethereum purchases within just 30 minutes, withdrawing 12,702 ETH from the Binance exchange. This amount of the second largest cryptocurrency is evaluated at approximately $40 million in fiat.\n\nEarlier, the same \u201csuspected Justin Sun wallet\u201d purchased 10,136 ETH from the same crypto trading platform. Overall, within less than a consecutive 10 days, Justin Sun\u2019s wallet has accumulated almost $300 million worth of crypto \u2013 a whopping 104,055 ETH.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin Sun has not been the only large investor scooping up Ethereum recently. As reported by U.Today, an anonymous whale made a gigantic investment into this cryptocurrency by purchasing 58,134 ETH within the last three days using Binance and 1inch exchanges for their fund transfers.\n\nEthereum briefly surpasses $3,000\n\nEarlier today, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization value, Ethereum, briefly surged above the $3,000 level, as was expected by many in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe price increase constituted 4.24%. ETH failed to hold at that peak, though, and went back down 2.05%, landing at the $2,978 mark where it is exchanging hands at the time of this writing.\n\nEthereum largely reached that high for the first time since mid-April 2022 in light of the community expecting spot Ethereum ETFs to be approved soon. Standard Chartered banking giant announced its forecast that the Securities and Exchange Commission regulator of the U.S. market will grant approval for these exchange-traded products by May 23. Should this happen, the bank continues, Ethereum is likely to skyrocket to the colossal $4,000 price mark.\n\nThe price surge would be driven by rising demand for Ethereum coming from potential Ethereum ETF issuers \u2013 among them Grayscale and BlackRock. Both funds have already launched spot-based Bitcoin ETFs \u2013 they have been trading since Jan. 11."

        "content": "Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has reached the US$3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, in what investors and market watchers are calling the arrival of \u201caltcoin season.\u201d\n\nAltcoin season refers to a period when cryptocurrencies experience significant increases in value compared to Bitcoin. This is often characterized by a surge in market interest, investment, and price appreciation of altcoins.\n\nDuring an altcoin season, investors and traders may shift their focus from Bitcoin to altcoins in search of higher returns, driven by speculation, new project developments, or broader market trends.\n\nEther outperformed Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies on Tuesday and briefly traded above US$3,000 before tracing back. It traded at US$2,918 at 1:30 p.m. ET, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEther is up by 10.8% for the week.\n\nThe increase has been attributed to the anticipation of a potential approval for a spot-based Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could attract more traditional and institutional investors.\n\nThe approval of a spot Ether ETF is expected to mirror the success of new Bitcoin ETFs that debuted last month, which have already attracted significant allocations.\n\nIn addition to ETF speculation, Ethereum\u2019s upcoming network upgrade, known as the Dencun upgrade, is also contributing to the positive sentiment.\n\nThe upgrade, scheduled for March 13, aims to implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, introducing proto-danksharding to simplify transactions and reduce costs by storing some data off the blockchain. This technical enhancement is expected to speed up transactions."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Could Reach $4,000 In March On 4 Factors Including Spot ETF - CoinGape",
        "content": "The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January turned the spotlight on Ethereum price, the second-largest cryptocurrency. Investors believe Ethereum has a high probability of receiving a spot ETF, especially with several proposals already with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nDespite the growing optimism, ETH clawed back some of the gains it accrued earlier this week, falling from slightly above $3,000 to $2,900. The pullback came upon increased volatility in the market, with Bitcoin (BTC) rejecting $53,000 for a sweep at $50,500.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBesides Ethereum, other altcoins such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) also pulled back to gather more liquidity. This could account for the modest price gains in the market on Thursday.\n\nEthereum price is one of the most uniquely placed projects, considering its standing as the second-largest crypto, the largest smart contracts platform, and its upcoming Dencun upgrade.\n\nThis article looks at these factors and more to determine the role they are likely to play in ETH\u2019s recovery journey in the short term.\n\n1. The Dencun Upgrade Scheduled For March\n\nThe Dencun upgrade comprised of two separate upgrades \u201cDeneb\u201d and \u201cCancun,\u201d is a major improvement for the Ethereum network that will increase its scalability and efficiency when implemented.\n\nIt will introduce proto-danksharding, a feature that will reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, which are faster and cheaper than the main chain. The upgrade has been tested on three testnets: Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.\n\nWith the final launch expected in March 2024, Ethereum price is already showing signs of an incoming rally. The token surged to highs slightly above $3,000 this week, backing positive sentiment.\n\n2. The Spot ETF\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been referred to as a major development for the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to validating Bitcoin as a global mature asset, ETFs allow traditional investors who are not interested in the complexities of crypto to get exposure to BTC.\n\nMoreover, the move opened the door to fresh speculation regarding the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF. Two years after the approval of Bitcoin futures ETF, Ethereum got its futures ETF. Experts say that the wait could be much short-term for the spot ETF.\n\nLike Bitcoin the hype surrounding the ETF could be a major catalyst for Ethereum price in the coming months.\n\nRecommended: Ethereum Price Rally Gains Momentum for $4000, Here Why?\n\n3. Staking\n\nValidators in the Ethereum ecosystem are required to stake at least 32 ETH. This condition significantly reduces the circulating supply. Ether becoming a PoS network through the Merge in 2022 allowed investors to freely stake and withdraw liquidity.\n\nContrary to expectations, the transition to PoS made staking even more attractive to investors, who have so far locked in $46.65 billion worth of ETH in smart contracts, according to Defi Llama.\n\nUnlike 2022 and 2023 when Ethereum experienced a persistent drop in staked assets, 2024 is looking positive, implying that investors have a long-term bullish outlook.\n\nAn increase in staking translates to reduced sell-side pressure. Holders stake tokens they do not intend to sell in the near future, expecting the price will rise with time.\n\n4. Ethereum Price Dons Bullish Technical Structure\n\nDespite the correction from $3,000, Ethereum still holds above key indicators like the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Besides, support at $2,900 stopped the decline on Wednesday, realigning ETH with the upward trajectory.\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that dips are profitable. So until support at $2,800 flips, traders may want to consider buying ETH and in the process contributing to the momentum targeting $4,000 in March or before Bitcoin halving. The Ichimoku Cloud also affirms Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "Quick take:\n\nThe investment comes after EigenLayer\u2019s $50 million fundraising last March led by Blockchain Capital.\n\nEigenLayer uses a points system for those who stake on the platform and have no plans to launch a native token.\n\nFounder Sreeram Kannan believes the platform is not affected by the SEC\u2019s increasing scrutiny of staking platforms.\n\nEigenLayer has received a $100 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz (A16z). The Ethereum restaking protocol enables Web3 developers building on top of Ethereum to leverage the blockchain\u2019s security for their networks.\n\nSpeaking on the Big Take podcast, which is broadcast through iHeart Radio, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal, EigenLayer co-founder Sreeram Kannan explained why his company\u2019s platform operates slightly differently from traditional staking protocols.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when you stake on Ethereum, you are promising that you\u2019re going to run the Ethereum network nodes correctly,\u201d Kannan said in an interview. \u201cWith restaking, you are taking the same Ether and making additional promises that you will also validate other networks correctly.\u201d\n\nThis announcement comes on the back of EigenLayer\u2019s $50 million fundraising in March 2023, which was led by Blockchain Capital.\n\nAlthough most staking protocols have issued their own tokens, EigenLayer maintains it does not plan to launch a native token, and will instead continue to use its paint-based system for those who stake on the platform.\n\nMost staking platforms have come under scrutiny from the SEC chair Gary Gensler who believes the protocols are breaking SEC rules by staking tokens. However, according to Kannan, his company is \u201cessentially offering a marketplace for those looking to restake,\u201d and does not conduct the actual staking process, which is being scrutinised by regulators.\n\n\u201cIf Gary Gensler understood what we\u2019re building, he would like us a lot,\u201d he said. According to EigenLayer, \u201cusers that stake $ETH can opt-in to EigenLayer smart contracts to restake their $ETH and extend cryptoeconomic security to additional applications on the network,\u201d through a primitive the company describes as the \u201crehypothetication of $ETH on the consensus layer.\u201d\n\nTo A16z, this investment demonstrates the venture capital firm\u2019s commitment to investing in crypto. The firm raised $4.5 billion in 2022 for crypto projects, and despite a relatively bear crypto market, it has continued to invest.\n\nA16z General Partner, Ali Yahya thinks that EigenLayer will play an important part in the advancement of the crypto industry. \u201cIt will enable all sorts of new kinds of applications to be built,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will stake capital in order to gain rewards from new services that get spun up on top of EigenLayer.\u201d\n\n****\n\nStay up to date:\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter using this link \u2013 we won\u2019t spam!"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent post titled \"ETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive,\" on the X platform, Fred Krueger, known for his staunch support of Bitcoin, delivered a harsh critique of Ethereum (ETH), highlighting concerning trends and indicating a bleak outlook for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns over ETH's declining user activity\n\nKrueger began by pointing out that despite Ethereum's soaring price, indicative of a robust ecosystem, the actual usage of the Ethereum blockchain has witnessed a notable decline. He highlighted that while ETH has surged to $3,000, the number of Daily Active Users (DAUs) on the Ethereum network has dwindled from 120,000 in 2021 to a mere 66,000 in the past year.\n\nThe decline in active users is further exemplified by the dwindling numbers on Uniswap V3, Ethereum's leading decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol. With just 16,000 DAUs, a stark contrast to the 60,000-plus seen in 2020, Krueger noted that Ethereum's utility as a transactional platform seems to be eroding.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right?\n\n\n\nNope.\n\n\n\nEth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\nThis statistic is particularly alarming considering Ethereum's role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and its aspirations to become the backbone of various decentralized applications (dApps), especially in the face of the upcoming Dencun Upgrade.\n\nEthereum: Meme coin in disguise?\n\nKrueger likened Ethereum's current state to that of a \"meme coin,\" drawing parallels to assets like Shiba Inu (SHIB). He emphasized that despite its soaring valuation, Ethereum's utility seems to have dwindled, particularly in comparison to other blockchain networks such as Solana, Avalanche and Near, which offer cheaper and faster transactions.\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism regarding the possibility of an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval, citing concerns about regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), unlikely to greenlight an Ethereum ETF due to potential issues surrounding its premined nature, Krueger cautioned against banking on such an approval as a catalyst for Ethereum's growth."

        "title": "Ethereum Price Taps $3,000 As DeFi TVL Soars To $45B, Ushering In The Altseason? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Ethereum price has been on a roller coaster ride, reaching $3,000 for the first time since April 2022, before falling back to $2,900 to gather more liquidity.\n\nThe number two cryptocurrency has several catalysts behind its stellar performance, such as the Dencun upgrade and the spot ETF, which give it an edge over Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nETH has gained 6% in value in the past week, outshining its peer, which as discussed earlier, faces liquidity at $53,000 \u2013 a level that it must clear to keep the uptrend intact.\n\nThe bellwether cryptocurrency slipped below $51,000 on Wednesday in a move that could pave the way for a stronger rebound, targeting pre-halving levels in the area between $58,000 and $60,000.\n\nHow Surge In Staking Could Trigger Ethereum Price Rally\n\nEthereum earned the deflationary status after the Merge upgrade, with which the network transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work protocol like Bitcoin.\n\nSince the Merge, the supply of ETH has increased by 1,047,643 according to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives Amberdata. But at the same time, 1,407,200 ETH have been burned or taken out of circulation. Effectively, the net supply of ETH dropped by 359,557.\n\nBitcoin, by contrast, saw its supply grow by 1.7% in the same timeframe, showing that Ethereum is becoming a scarce asset, thanks to the mechanism that destroys a portion of the transaction fees paid to validators.\n\nMoreover, more than a quarter of Ethereum\u2019s supply, or about 30.1 million ETH, is now locked in staking contracts, earning rewards for securing the network.\n\nCumulatively, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ecosystem is now above $45 billion up from $20 billion at the start of the bull market in Q4 last year, Defi Llama data shows.\n\nSpikes in TVL affirm the long-term bullish sentiment in the market. Investors are willing to bet on Ethereum\u2019s long-term bullish outlook by locking their holdings out of circulating supply, essentially reducing sell-side pressure.\n\nThis coupled with key market movers like the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade and the hype building around a potential spot ETF points to a parabolic rally in the months ahead.\n\nEthereum could also ride on the momentum from the Bitcoin halving anticipated in April. Historical price action backs halving as a potential bull run trigger not only for BTC but also for altcoins.\n\nEthereum Price Technical Outlook: Bullish Or Bearish?\n\nSeveral key levels are emerging as Ethereum climbs above $3,000. Although the brief climb above $3,000 was a welcome bullish gesture, failure to close above it allowed traders to take liquidity, which may explain the correction to $2,900 on Wednesday.\n\nWith the price currently pivotal at $2,900, the next vital area is the green band around $2,800. Several four-hour candles close under $2,900 could validate additional dips to this support level, allowing Ether to collect liquidity as investors buy the dip. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) backs the demand zone.\n\nThe technical structure remains bullish unless the 50-day EMA flips becoming an immediate resistance. Until then, traders may take advantage of dips to gain more exposure to Ethereum price ahead of its next breakout attempt above $3,000.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

Earlier today, XRP plunged to just 0.000184 on the Binance exchange, according to TradingView data.\n\nWhen XRP surpassed Ethereum\n\nIn September 2018, the Ripple-affiliated XRP token experienced a remarkable surge, overtaking Ethereum to become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThis shift in ranking was fueled by bullish sentiment from investors, who believed Ripple would become the standard for international bank transfers.\n\nBack then, XRP's market cap reached $22.2 billion, eclipsing Ethereum's $22.1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of the data provided, Ethereum has a market capitalization of $346.957 billion, while XRP's market cap stands at $29.308 billion. This indicates that Ethereum's market cap is significantly larger than that of XRP.\n\nEthereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trailing behind Bitcoin. XRP is positioned in a distant sixth place.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThe underperformance of XRP against Ethereum has sparked a series of unfounded conspiracy theories within the crypto community.\n\nSome supporters of XRP argue that the SEC may have shown favoritism toward Ethereum, giving it a \"free pass\" while choosing to pursue legal action against XRP.\n\nThese unfounded theories, often shared on social media and cryptocurrency forums, imply that Ethereum's backers could have inappropriately swayed the SEC's regulatory actions, a claim for which there is no concrete evidence. This narrative has gained traction despite repeated calls for evidence-based discussions.\n\nCritics of these theories, including figures like Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, have pointed out the lack of proof behind such accusations and have called for a return of rational discourse within the community."

With EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), a new transaction type called \u2018blob-carrying transactions\u2019 is introduced, reducing transaction costs for both L2 users and ramping up Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput.\n\nPopular crypto analyst Miles Deutscher explains that the Ethereum Dencun upgrade will reduce transaction fees on Layer-2 platforms by a considerable magnitude. The analyst also emphasizes the increased commercial viability for dApp developers and users. This shift will position L2s as more appealing options compared to alternative L1s, offering a positive catalyst across various sectors such as DeFi applications, gaming platforms, and on-chain trading.\n\nLayer-2 Platforms That Benefit From Dencun Upgrade\n\nAlthough several Layer-2 platforms will benefit from the Ethereum Dencun upgrade, Miles Deutscher shares his coveted list of those platforms that he thinks will benefit the most.\n\nPolygon (MATIC): Deutscher noted that $MATIC currently finds itself in a compelling position. It\u2019s on the verge of rebranding to POL. Despite lagging behind other L2s, there\u2019s been notable investment in implementing zk technology. Considering these factors, Deutscher believes $MATIC could emerge as a strong performer in the weeks or months ahead. Arbitrum: Arbitrum\u2019s metrics remain impressive, solidifying its position as a preferred chain for launching new dApps. Maintaining its status as the top L2 in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), Arbitrum also boasts transaction volume that outpaces other L2 solutions. Optimism: Optimism ranks as the second-largest L2 by Total Value Locked (TVL), closely following Arbitrum, and it has demonstrated robustness in transaction processing. Recently, the platform unveiled its fourth airdrop, which is expected to reignite interest and activity within the ecosystem. COTI Network: COTI has unveiled V2, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution focused on privacy, featuring the introduction of \u2018Garbled Circuits.\u2019 This innovative technology offers an efficient method for maintaining privacy, marking the blockchain\u2019s maiden implementation of such a feature. Mantle: Mantle is currently among the rapidly expanding Layer 2 solutions. With over $1.5 billion worth of ETH staked as mETH (Mantle Staked ETH), it ranks as the third-largest LSD (Layer 2 Staked Deposit) after Lido and RocketPool. Moreover, mETH stakers can anticipate some promising airdrops in the near future. Metis: Metis is experiencing a wave of favorable developments that are propelling its growth forward. Notable among these is the establishment of the 4.6 million $METIS Ecosystem Fund, signaling a significant injection of $400 million into the ecosystem. Additionally, the upcoming launch of the decentralized sequencer alpha mainnet in March promises to further enhance the platform\u2019s capabilities and usability. Moreover, the implementation of the LSB (Liquid Staking Blitz) campaign is poised to bolster participation and engagement within the Metis community.\n\nMiles Duestscher stated that he\u2019s keeping a close watch on other Layer-2 Networks such as Manta Network, Starknet, zkSync, and Linea.\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "Another day, another cryptocurrency exchange falls victim to a massive data breach. This time, it\u2019s FixedFloat, a non-KYC Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto exchange targeted in a wallet-drainer attack.\n\nFixedFloat, a decentralized crypto exchange, has been hacked for at least $26 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The attack, initially attributed to minor technical issues, has led to frozen transactions and missing funds.\n\nFor your information, FixedFloat is an automated crypto exchange with 26% of its web traffic coming from the US. It integrates with Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAs seen by Hackread.com, users reported frozen transactions and missing funds on the X exchange since February 17, with 409 Bitcoin (Approximately $21 million) and 1,728 Ether tokens (approximately $4.7 million) drained on February 18.\n\nThe exchange is investigating the security incident. FixedFloat\u2019s website is also displaying an error message on all pages, stating \u201cERROR \u2013 Technical work is underway, we will be back soon! If you need to contact us, you can do this via chat.\u201d\n\nThe stolen funds were sent to the Ethereum exchange. Threat researcher going by the X (formerly Twitter) handle of \u201cOfficer\u2019s Notes\u201d revealed that the hacker first transferred ETH to different ETH addresses and finally moved them to the eXch exchange. They then sent funds to two HitBTC addresses, which received their initial ETH deposits in 2021. This seems to be an attempt to create a false trail.\n\n. @FixedFloat hacked, resulting in ~1,728 ETH (worth ~$4.85m) and & 409 BTC (worth ~$21m) stolen. The drainer already transferred most of the stolen ETH to eXch on Ethereum. 26M$ loss in total!\n\n\n\nDrainer on Ethereum (1700 ETH stolen): 0x85c4fF99bF0eCb24e02921b0D4b5d336523Fa085\u2026 https://t.co/imeXB1h7Jv pic.twitter.com/oquw373NOG \u2014 Officer's Notes (@officer_cia) February 19, 2024\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any addresses (other than the hacker\u2019s address) that link these 2 HitBTC deposit addresses\u2026Most likely, the hacker created only a false trail,\u201d the researcher explained on X (Twitter). This was confirmed by the Web3 security platform Cyvers on X as well.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange confirmed it was an external attack, rubbishing rumours of insider involvement. Users and analysts initially claimed FixedFloat developers were behind the hacking, but the exchange denied any internal involvement.\n\nAlthough the company is yet to reveal the core information on how it happened, cybersecurity researchers are positive that the hack was caused by vulnerabilities and insufficient security measures, allowing the attacker to bypass defences and access core service functions.\n\nWallet Drainer Attack?\n\nAs to what type of vulnerabilities, researchers believe that it was a wallet drainer attack. A wallet drainer attack is a malicious technique employed by cybercriminals to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims\u2019 wallets. It typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts or tricking users into granting unauthorized access to their funds.\n\nFixedFloat stated that no user funds were affected, but the hack affected 30 outstanding orders, which the exchange will pay as soon as its services resume.\n\nFixedFloat faced criticism for not reporting the hack immediately, while the company maintains it was focusing on minimizing loss and eliminating vulnerabilities. The platform expects full operations to resume soon and release a detailed report after the investigation is complete.\n\nSurge in Drainer Attacks\n\nNevertheless, it is concerning that cryptocurrency exchanges have become a prominent target of scammers lately. Last month Group-IB Global Pvt. Ltd. disclosed details of a phishing operation dubbed Inferno Drainer targeting cryptocurrency wallet providers. The scammers targeted over 100 brands and 16,000 malicious domains, stealing over $80 million in digital assets from November 2022 to November 2023. The team reaped $87 million in illicit profits and scammed over 137,000 victims.\n\nIn June 2023, Pink Drainer, a notorious hacker group, successfully executed a series of high-profile Discord and Twitter hacks targeting projects like Evomos, Pika Protocol, OpenAI CTO, and Orbiter Finance. Online scam detector ScamSniffer confirmed Pink Drainer stole around $3 million from nearly 1,932 victims."

        "title": "Coinbase To SEC: 5 Arguments For A Spot Ethereum ETF - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has formally responded to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the proposal for a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, announced through social media platform X that the company submitted a comprehensive 27-page response, complete with 96 citations, to advocate for the approval of the proposed Grayscale Ether Trust (ETHE) ETP.\n\nToday @coinbase responded to @SECGov's request for comment on the proposed @Grayscale Ether Trust ($ETHE) ETP. 27 pages and 96 citations that provide the (1) legal, (2) technical, and (3) economic rationale for approval. 1/6 \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) February 21, 2024\n\nEthereum\u2019s Classification As A Commodity\n\nThe cornerstone of Coinbase\u2019s argument rests on the classification of ETH as a commodity rather than a security. Grewal\u2019s articulation, \u201cETH is not a security\u2026before and after the Merge, the SEC, the CFTC, and the market have treated ETH not as a security but a commodity,\u201d underscores the consensus among regulatory bodies and market participants regarding Ethereum\u2019s status. This classification aligns with the legal framework necessary for the SEC to consider an ETF based on ETH.\n\nPrecedent Set By Bitcoin ETF Approvals\n\nCoinbase leverages the SEC\u2019s prior approval of Bitcoin ETFs as a precedent, advocating for consistent regulatory treatment for Ethereum. Grewal posits, \u201cThe economics show that ETH is as resilient as BTC in satisfying the Commission\u2019s standard for ETP approvals,\u201d highlighting the parallel between Ether\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s market robustness and maturity. This comparison serves to remind the SEC of the rationale behind its earlier decisions and suggests a similar approach for ETH.\n\nTechnological And Operational Security Of Ethereum\n\nThe submission emphasizes the technological and operational security mechanisms inherent in Ethereum\u2019s blockchain, particularly post-Merge. The transition to Proof of Stake is presented as a significant enhancement to Ethereum\u2019s security features, reducing its susceptibility to fraud and manipulation. This technological robustness is a critical factor in Coinbase\u2019s argument, underscoring the reliability and stability of ETH as an underlying asset for an ETF.\n\nMarket Dynamics And Resilience\n\nCoinbase presents a detailed analysis of Ethereum\u2019s market dynamics, including its depth, liquidity, and the tightness of spreads. Grewal notes, \u201cETH\u2019s market depth, tightness of spreads, and price correlation across spot markets are highly indicative of a market resilient to fraud and manipulation.\u201d This argument is designed to assure the SEC of ETH\u2019s market stability and its capacity to support an ETF without introducing significant risks to investors.\n\nSurveillance-Sharing Agreement And Market Oversight\n\nFinally, Coinbase highlights the surveillance-sharing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a mechanism for ensuring comprehensive market oversight. This agreement, as described by Grewal, \u201cfacilitates the sharing of information\u2026through its surveillance of the CME ETH futures market,\u201d which is crucial for monitoring and preventing fraudulent and manipulative practices in the ETH market.\n\nIn conclusion, Coinbase\u2019s submission to the SEC is a rigorously constructed argument that combines legal precedent, technical security, and market stability analyzes to advocate for the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nStandard Chartered predicts SEC approval for an Ethereum ETF by May 23, potentially causing a price surge to $4,000 for ETH. However, Dave LaValle, head of Grayscale ETFs, recently said there is only a 50% chance that the SEC will approve the conversion of its ETH trust into a spot ETF in May.\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $2,961.\n\nFeatured image created with DALLE, chart from TradingView.com"

        "title": "Crypto: Shiba Inu Unleashes Ethereum Power for New NFT collection - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Thu 22 Feb 2024 \u25aa 4 min read \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nThe crypto project team for Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently announced the launch of its latest non-fungible token (NFT) collection, entitled \u201cSHEboshis\u201d. This initiative marks a significant milestone for the project, as it introduces the use of the ERC-404 standard, a first in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Ethereum ERC-404 standard promises to bring enhanced fluidity and to facilitate the fractionalization of NFTs, thus opening new prospects for holders and investors. In this article, we will explore the implications of this advancement.\n\nNew Horizons with Ethereum ERC-404\n\nThe SHEboshis venture represents a bold dive into the uncharted territories of the ERC-404 standard. Kaal Dhairya, a crypto developer at Shiba Inu, shared in a blog post the team\u2019s excitement about exploring the yet untapped potential of this standard. The Ethereum ERC-404, which combines the features of the ERC-721 standard (dedicated to NFTs) and ERC-20 (for fungible tokens), is a standard that aims to make NFTs more liquid and to encourage their fractionable nature. It is seen as a potential game-changer in the Ethereum ecosystem and the crypto market at large.\n\nThe decision to mint the SHEboshis on the Ethereum network was driven by the desire to leverage the significant liquidity of the latter, thereby giving the SHEboshis the launch they deserve. In the long run, the team plans to bridge these NFTs to Shibarium.\n\nHowever, the launch was not without its challenges. A bug temporarily allowed for additional minting, which resulted in an excess allocation of NFTs to certain addresses. Dhairya apologized for the inconvenience caused and announced the increase of the total number of SHEboshis from 12,000 to 20,000 to compensate for this incident.\n\nThe Allocation of Unexpected Sales Revenue\n\nThis technical incident which allowed for an additional issue of SHEboshis resulted in unexpected sales, generating revenue of 652 Ethereums for the Shiba Inu team. In a gesture of transparency and commitment to the crypto community, the team detailed how these funds would be used.\n\nHalf of these proceeds will be allocated to strategic initiatives, including token supply reduction through \u201cburn\u201d operations (token destruction), donations to charities, as well as to the team itself and the provision of liquidity for the NFT project. Charitable donations will be directed towards specific causes, such as support for relief efforts in Japan following the Noto earthquake, as well as to non-profit organizations such as the Manny Pacquiao Foundation and Women in Blockchain. The remaining portion of the revenue will be dedicated to operational expenses and the team\u2019s treasury, with the goal of continuing their mission towards a decentralized future, as described in the project\u2019s crypto whitepaper.\n\nIn conclusion, Shiba Inu\u2019s initiative to introduce SHEboshis NFTs through the ERC-404 standard on Ethereum marks a significant turning point in the crypto ecosystem. By combining technological innovation and community commitment, Shiba Inu not only pushes the boundaries of what NFTs can be but also paves the way for new possibilities in liquidity and \u201cfractionalization\u201d of digital assets.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

        "content": "The Ethereum Foundation, alongside Aztec, Polygon, Scroll, Taiko, and zkSync has announce the launch of the first ZK Grants Round. This grants initiative aims to enhance the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer 2 Ecosystem, with a total shared prize pool of $900,000.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, each contributor, including the Ethereum Foundation, raised $150,000 to support research and development for ZK proofs and standards.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. Established in 2014, the EF aims to promote Ethereum and related technologies without controlling or leading them. Instead, the EF serves as one component of a broader ecosystem.\n\nThe EF focuses on initiatives such as the Ecosystem Support Program, which provides both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the wider Ethereum community.\n\nA zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method used to prove knowledge about a piece of data without revealing the data itself. It allows one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a claim is true without disclosing any information other than the fact that the claim is true.\n\nZKPs are used to provide privacy guarantees and are employed in various blockchain use cases, such as identity management, authentication, and private transactions.\n\nAccording to a report from Protocol Labs, the zero-knowledge proof market is anticipated to generate $75 million in revenue by 2024 and is expected to surpass $10 billion by 2030. The report further highlights a projection of almost 90 billion zero-knowledge proofs being needed for web3 applications alone in the year 2030.\n\nApplication dates and deadlines for the funding\n\nEthereum Foundation also noted in the announcement that interested parties are invited to submit proposals by 11:59 UTC on March 18th, 2024. These projects can be in various stages of development, including ideas, proof-of-concepts, work in progress, and fleshed-out projects.\n\nThe focus of development includes enhancing multi-prover systems for validity, ZK, and fraud proof. It added that the funding is also open to projects that improve various proof systems, enhance efficiency and user-friendliness of ZK Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), and create security benchmarks for ZK Rollups (ZKRs) and bridges.\n\nAdditionally, teams can explore the development of tools and interfaces for ZK and validity-proof based Layer 2 solutions, creating transpilers between zkDSL and Solidity, and investigating hardware acceleration for ZK protocols.\n\nAll proposals are expected to be submitted in PDF format, English language, with detailed descriptions, budgets, timelines, an applicant profile, and a link to published work. Eligible projects must be open source, align with the round\u2019s goals, and benefit the Ethereum ZK Layer 2 ecosystem as public goods.\n\nEvaluation criteria include impact on the Ethereum ZK Layer 2 ecosystem, value to multiple Layer 2 solutions, documentation clarity, and proposing individual or team experience.\n\nEthereum Foundation revealed that ineligible projects involve illegal activities, financial products or services, art or social impact initiatives, retroactive funding requests, and those planning token launches or public funding rounds."

        "content": "An intriguing analysis has surfaced from a prominent analyst, borovik.eth, shedding light on Ethereum\u2019s potential trajectory within the overall market. According to borovik.eth, Ethereum has the capability to ascend to the level of a $1 trillion asset, a prospect that has garnered widespread attention among investors.\n\nPrice Projection at $1 Trillion Market Cap\n\nAt the milestone of a $1 trillion market cap, borovik.eth predicts that the price of Ethereum (ETH) could soar to an impressive $8,322. This bold prediction has ignited discussions and debates within the crypto community, prompting stakeholders to contemplate the implications of such a significant valuation.\n\nETH will be a 1 TRILLION asset this cycle\n\n\n\nAt 1 trillion, $ETH will be $8,322\n\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t BULLISH enough! pic.twitter.com/psmhR5b7bN February 20, 2024\n\nCurrent Market Status\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $2,948.11, reflecting a notable surge of 11% over the past seven days. This recent price increase has propelled ETH beyond the $3,000 milestone, a significant achievement not seen in over two years. However, amidst the excitement surrounding this milestone, lingering questions persist regarding ETH\u2019s ability to maintain its newfound momentum and avoid a recurrence of past bearish trends.\n\nHistorical data paints a cautionary picture, with Ethereum experiencing a substantial downturn the last time it surpassed the $3,000 mark in 2022, witnessing a staggering plunge of nearly 70%. The looming question now is whether history will repeat itself, casting doubt over Ethereum\u2019s current upward trajectory.\n\nAlso Read: ETH Surpasses $3,000; Why is Ethereum Up Today?\n\nOn-Chain Metrics Analysis\n\nExamining on-chain metrics provides valuable insights into Ethereum\u2019s current status and potential future path. Data from IntoTheBlock reveals that over 16 million ETH addresses are currently at a loss of approximately 15%. Notably, nearly 879,000 addresses stand to become profitable if ETH continues to breach the $3,000 threshold. This influx of potentially profitable addresses further introduces the possibility of increased selling pressure as holders seek to break even at this psychologically significant level.\n\nETH is extremely close to breaking $3k.

With over 83% of addresses already in profit, Ethereum is likely to overcome this challenge with minimal disruption to its overall trajectory.\n\nFurthermore, as ETH progresses towards a $1 trillion market cap, investors will closely monitor market dynamics and on-chain data for further insights into Ethereum\u2019s price movements and potential challenges. With Ethereum standing at a critical juncture in its evolution, the crypto community eagerly anticipates whether borovik.eth\u2019s bold prediction will come to fruition.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Surges Towards $3,000: Can ETH Hit $5,000 Next?"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency universe witnessed quite the bustle today, February 22, following a slump in crypto prices, per data by CoinMarketCap. As the global market cap took a hit, plunging 1.62% to the $1.95 trillion mark, a bearish sentiment appears to be prevailing within the broader crypto market. Prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana collectively witnessed a price slump today. This appears to come due to the massive crypto market liquidation witnessed yesterday, per CoinGape Media\u2019s report. However, sentiment for bolstered prices looms over the crypto horizon even though Fed\u2019s stance on unchanged rates prevails. The crypto market appears to have witnessed the prior mentioned liquidation aligning with this.\n\nMajor Crypto Prices Today\n\nAs mentioned above, the Bitcoin price continued its downward movement post-liquidation today, falling 1.28% in the past 24 hours. The current BTC price rests at $51,411, with a market cap of $1.009 trillion. Meanwhile, the token also witnessed a substantial drop in its 24-hour trading volume, falling 9.45% and reaching $29.25 billion. Derivatives data also showcased a 1.18% drop in BTC open interest, hinting at a downtrend prevailing in the market.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, the Ethereum price marked a considerable 3% dip over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,918. After a phenomenal run past the $3K mark, the 2nd most renowned cryptocurrency witnessed a significant plunge following yesterday\u2019s $300 million liquidation. As of writing, ETH too witnessed a noteworthy decrease of 2.87% in the token\u2019s market cap, reaching $350.97 billion, whereas the 24-hour trading volume dropped 3.41% to $19.08 billion.\n\nSolana\u2019s price fell by 3.98% over the past day and is currently trading at $102.74. The token\u2019s mark cap jotted a drop of 3.98%, reaching $45.29 billion, whereas the 24-hour trading volume also plummeted 13.63%, reaching $2.23 billion. XRP, the Ripple-backed token, witnessed a 2.80% dip over the past day and currently stands at $0.5421. Even XRP\u2019s 24-hour trading volume fell 19.11%, while the market cap stood at $29.58 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Sam Bankman-Fried Opts to Retain New Legal Team Amid Concerns\n\nThe Top Crypto\u2019s Prices For Today\n\nWorldcoin Price Soars\n\nWith a boasted market cap of $977.89 million, the Worldcoin price soared 4.33% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $7.36. The token marked a phenomenal week with the past seven days as a staggering 137.73% surge was witnessed, per market charts. This bullish movement comes primarily from numerous factors, including whale accumulations, burgeoning project adoption, etc.\n\nPepe Coin Price Falls\n\nAs of writing, the Pepe coin (PEPE) price, a meme coin, dropped 4.21% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.000001116.

        "title": "Ethereum breaches $3,000 as ETF anticipation grows - City A.M.",
        "content": "Ethereum breaches $3,000 as ETF anticipation grows\n\nToday is the day of the long-awaited Ethereum Dencun upgrade. Dencun will reduce Layer 2 transaction fees and involve \u201cblobs\u201d and \u201cProto-dank sharding\u201d. On Monday, Ethereum punched above $4,000 for the first time since December 2021. This new cycle high has happened even in the face of the perceived diminishing likelihood of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) being approved by the SEC.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ethereum (ETH) crossed $3,000 for the first time since April 2022. Anticipation of the Ethereum spot ETF approval deadline on 23 May is one of the main catalysts.\n\nThe deadline forces the SEC to decide whether or not spot Ethereum ETF products will also become available for US investors. It will also retest BlackRock\u2019s near-undefeated ETF approval win rate of 576-1.\n\nHester Pierce, the crypto-friendly SEC commissioner, asserted the SEC would avoid repeating the mistakes made with the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn the case of bitcoin, it took the crypto trust Grayscale to resort to legal action, needlessly extending the process and highlighting the SEC\u2019s hostility towards Bitcoin and crypto. Ethereum\u2019s recognition as a commodity by US regulators diminishes reasons for rejection.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase endorsed Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its ETH trust into an ETF \u2013 emphasising this stance.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum community has shown readiness to adapt its technology. Ethereum is more of a technology platform than the \u2018digital gold\u2019 that Bitcoin stands for.\n\nThe March 13 Dencun hard fork serves as an example of Ethereum\u2019s tech adaptability and will enhance the platform\u2019s scalability. These changes are expected to boost transaction throughput.\n\nThey will also reduce transaction costs on Ethereum\u2019s scaling protocols, known as Layer 2s, such as Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nFrom a wider market point of view, the saying \u201csell in May and go away\u201d becomes more interesting as crypto edges towards previous all-time highs.\n\nWith bullish developments such as strong Bitcoin ETF flows, the approaching Bitcoin halving and Ethereum\u2019s potential spot ETF, demand for crypto is evidently rising.\n\nThe final bullish indicator comes from an unexpected direction. The European Central Bank (ECB) released a blog with reasons why Bitcoin is still worth 0.\n\nThe last time this happened was in November 2022, when the ECB\u2019s blog post \u201cBitcoin\u2019s last stand\u201d perfectly marked the bear cycle\u2019s bottom.\n\nCrypto market participants have not failed to point out the irony. For now, the ECB does not mention Ethereum in its blog posts, but an ETF launch could change this. The sentiment remains bullish."

Per the report, others expressed concerns over the progress of inflation. Nevertheless, some policy makers say the economic outlook appeared firmer than the December projections.\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\n\n\nFed Minutes suggest rates are at their peak https://t.co/J03IIvsmT5 pic.twitter.com/rEjWSwv3a7 \u2014 FXStreet News (@FXStreetNews) February 21, 2024\n\nFind detailed report here: Fed Minutes suggest rates are at their peak\n\nBitcoin price could revisit $48,000\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is almost showing a directional bias, breaking below the $51,335 support. Judging from the technical indicators, if BTC records a candlestick close below the aforementioned buyer congestion level, the king of cryptocurrency could roll over to the $48,000 psychological level. In a dire case, BTC could retest the order block between $45,556 and $46,691.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already registered a sell signal by crossing its signal line (yellow band), while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is dipping and could also cross below its signal line (orange band). Meanwhile, the MACD histogram bars are paling out.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls show resolve, Bitcoin price could recover, flipping $52,985 into support as it extends towards $55,000 or in a highly bullish case, $60,000 psychological level.

The paling MACD histogram bars accentuate this bearish thesis, solidified by the topped out MACD which is now deviating south.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a recovery among the bulls could send Ethereum price north, first clearing the range high of $3,033 before creating a local top above it.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price scrapes $3,000 psychological threshold after 20 months, inspiring conjecture on altseason\n\nRipple price subdued by growing overhead pressure\n\nRipple (XRP) price remains within the confines of the descending parallel channel, a status made worse by growing overhead pressure. Specifically, XRP price faces overhead pressure due to the 200 and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) at $0.5643 and $0.5835 levels respectively. These features, coupled with the sell signal that the RSI has just executed, tilt the odds in favor of the downside.\n\nAccordingly, Ripple price could make a 7% drop to $0.5001, levels last tested on February 7. If this level fails to hold as support, XRP price could slip through to the $0.4734 support floor, around 13% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls come in, enhanced buying pressure could see Ripple price recover. A northbound move could see the payments token overcome the 200 and 100-day SMAs, bring the $0.6000 psychological level within reach.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, XRP price could leap further to test the $0.6421 blockade, nearly 20% above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple CEO criticizes SEC says regulator has lost lawsuits consistently; XRP price holds firm above $0.55"

        "content": "Wall Street analysts led by Bernstein broker believe there is a 50 percent approval chance for spot Ethereum ETFs by May in the United States.\n\nEther\u2019s price reaching $3k for the first time in more than two years signals the beginning of the much-anticipated altseason.\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has officially begun the race to $10,000 after reaching $3k for the first time since May 2022. Ethereum price has as a result recovered all the losses induced by the collapse of Terra Luna UST. Furthermore, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rallied above the 70 level for the first time since May 2021, thus confirming the bulls are in control.\n\nRemarkably, Ethereum\u2019s price has outshined that of Bitcoin in the past week, with the latter increasing by 4.4% and the former by more than 12%. The notable rise in Ethereum price has been attributed to improved fundamentals and heightened demand from both institutional investors and retail traders. Moreover, ETH is the primary source of liquidity for the majority of web3 tokens and NFTs.\n\nTop Reasons Ethereum Price Rallied to $3k for the First Time in Two Years\n\nEthereum price rallied more than 88% since October last year to trade above $2,900 on Wednesday fueled by several notable fundamental factors. On the top list, the Ethereum investment products have registered notable cash inflows from institutional investors in the past few months. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the United States has raised the odds of Ether-based ETFs soon.\n\nWorth noting that the same fund managers that applied and received approval for spot BTC ETFs in the United States are now racing to offer Ether-based products. As CNF recently reported, Bernstein analysts believe there is a 50 percent chance the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the spot Ether ETFs by May.\n\nThe Ethereum price registered notable gains in the recent past fueled by heightened crypto cash rotation as more investors bet big on web3 mass adoption. With the Ethereum network already a deflationary ecosystem through the burning mechanism akin to the Bitcoin halving, the value of existing coins will continue to skyrocket.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ether price has enjoyed a bullish outlook in the recent past as the Ethereum core developers anticipate enabling its largest upgrade since Shanghai dubbed the Dencun upgrade in the coming weeks. Notably, the Dencun upgrade is primarily meant to lower transaction fees on Ethereum\u2019s layer-two ecosystem following proto-dank sharding.\n\nETH Price Analysis and Short-term Targets\n\nThe Ethereum price has only begun its long journey to a parabolic move expected later in the confirmed crypto bull cycle. From a technical standpoint, ETH bulls are well incentivized to rally above $3,000 in the coming months.\n\nAccording to the latest market data, ETH price has rallied over 25% in the past two weeks to trade at around $2,940 on Wednesday.\n\nKenny Hearn, SwissOne Capital\u2019s chief investment officer, noted;\n\nWe are very close in this move to levels around $3,150-$3,300. The next level after that would be $3,600 and we think this is quite easily attainable in the next month or so as the alts continue to play catch up,\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

Its new afETH token combines the yields on staked Ether and Convex tokens to generate a 10.2% yield for investors. That\u2019s significantly higher than the top three Ether liquid staking competitors \u2014 Ether.fi, Puffer Finance, and Kelp DAO\u2014 that offer yields between 3-4%.\n\nLaunched on February 20, afETH has already reached its 301 Ether \u2014 about $913,000 in today\u2019s price \u2014 deposit cap.\n\nAlthough afETH offers almost three times the returns at other protocols, it also comes with more risks. That\u2019s because 30% of it is backed by vlCVX \u2014 or vote-locked CVX \u2014 which has historically been much more volatile than Ether.\n\nAsymmetry also plans to take the other 70% of afETH\u2019s backing, which is made up of Frax\u2019s sfrxETH, and deposit it to buzzy restaking protocol EigenLayer to juice potential returns even more.\n\nLiquid restaking tokens, tokens that stake your Ether and then restake it in EigenLayer, are now close to $4 billion in total value locked \u2014 up from $296 million at the start of 2024.\n\nThe flurry of deposits to liquid restaking protocols recently has been due to a rising trend around of points \u2014 a wider trend in DeFi that typically heralds an upcoming airdrop. Users earn points \u2014 and free tradable tokens in the future \u2014 by using these protocols.\n\nLiquid restaking protocols are especially popular because they offer users EigenLayer points in addition to points for their own protocols.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nTotal value of crypto assets deposited in EigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer is a recent Ethereum protocol that introduces restaking by extending Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks. The EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the actual blockchain \u2014 will go live sometime in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nEigenLayer investors have collected over 1.7 billion of these points \u2014 worth nearly $240 million on Whales Market, a secondary market where one point trades for $0.14.\n\nAsymmetry currently does not restake with EigenLayer since deposits into EigenLayer have been paused. But once they are unpaused, Ether deposited in Asymmetry will be restaked, as per the protocol\u2019s announcement.\n\nAsymmetry Finance and points\n\nAssymetry Finance distributes points \u2014 dubbed gems \u2014 while also offering an outsized yield on its liquid restaking token, afETH.\n\nSince EigenLayer is not live yet, the yields received by liquid restaking tokens are generally the same as those you would receive staking Ether regularly.\n\nBut afETH is distinct from other LRTs on the market in at least one crucial way.\n\nWhile other LRTs represent a 1:1 deposit of a user\u2019s Ether, afETH is considered a hybrid LST and each afETH is backed by a blend of two tokens: sfrxETH and vlCVX.\n\nsfrxETH is the liquid staked Ether token offered by Frax Finance, and vlCVX is vote-locked governance token of Convex Finance. Vote-locked implies a user locked their tokens to gain the ability to vote in governance and it\u2019s used in another corner of DeFi, the so-called Curve Wars.\n\nHow afETH works\n\nWhen a user deposits their Ether into Asymmetry Finance, Asymmetry will take that deposit and automatically split it into 70% of sfrxETH and 30% of vlCVX.\n\nvlCVX, or vote locked CVX, is the key driver in producing the outsized yields offered by afETH.\n\nThe vlCVX is used in the Votium Vote Market, a market that lets protocols incentivize vote locked CVX users to vote for their liquidity pools, thereby directing valuable CRV token emissions to said pool.\n\nIn the last Votium round, which occur every two weeks, a total of $1.3 million was used as incentives for vlCVX votes.\n\nEssentially, vlCVX users are earning a 14.5% annual percentage return by being incentivized to vote for specific liquidity pools through Votium, and this yield is what lets afETH earn an over 10% APY.\n\nBut, the strategy \u2014 relying on vlCVX to back a liquid restaking token \u2014 comes with a number of risks.\n\nafETH may have the yield \u2014 but also the risks\n\nThe first risk is that users who may have just wanted to restake their Ether on Asymmetry are now exposed to the price of CVX.\n\nCVX is trading at $4.78, down over 90% from its all-time high of $49.9 on January 2, 2022.\n\nDaily price history for CVX\n\nAlthough recently the correlation \u2014 how similarly they trade \u2014 between CVX and Ether has been high, a hypothetical drop of 10% in the CVX price would cause afETH to lose about 3% in value.\n\nThe second risk is the lengthy lockup of vlCVX. Due to the 16 week lock period required for vlCVX, users who want to unstake from Assymetry are given two unstaking options: regular and instant.\n\nThe regular-unstake option gives the user 70% of Ether immediately, with the remainder available to claim at a later date depending on the availability of the vlCVX.\n\nDepending on how long it takes for the vlCVX portion to be available, by the time a user receives their deposit the price of vlCVX could move against them.\n\nThe instant-unstake option gives users their entire deposit in Ether, but it charges a fee and is only available for users withdrawing less than 2 Ether at a time.\n\nA third risk lies within maintaining the target afETH backing made up of sfrxETH and vlCVX.\u201dFor instance, they say they target 70/30 sfrxETH/vlCVX but it\u2019s manual process by privileged address to rebalance\u201d WormholeOracle, a pseudonymous researcher at crypto due diligence firm LlamaRisk, told DL News.\n\nThis target balance is not automated, instead it is managed by the Asymmetry team, and if it is not properly maintained, the backing of afETH could potentially skew even higher towards vlCVX, exposing afETH holders even more to the high volatility of vlCVX.\n\nAsymmetry did not respond to DL News\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nSince the launch of afETH, 59,638 CVX - some $290,000 - has been purchased and vote-locked.\n\nThe impact on price has been noticeable, since afETH launched on February 20 the price of CVX is up 14%, while Bitcoin is down 0.3% and Ether is up 1.2% for the same period.\n\nOf the 99 million total supply of CVX, just over 61 million is vote-locked which is an all-time high.\n\nAs the landscape of liquid restaking tokens becomes increasingly crowded, protocols like Asymmetry Finance are navigating a delicate balance between risk and reward to carve out their niche.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "title": "Ethereum Faces Sharp Rejection Near $3,000 As Profit-Taking Sentiment Rises! What\u2019s Next For ETH Price? - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "After [ccpw id=60415] soared past the $50K milestone, traders eagerly anticipated [ccpw id=60480] to mirror this success by crossing the $3K threshold. This expectation came to a conclusion as Ethereum shattered its two-year peak by breaking the $3,000 milestone, setting off a wave of short liquidations. This breakthrough has triggered bullish outlooks, prompting a rise in Ethereum accumulation by investors who are now gearing up for potential further price surges. Nevertheless, with the increase in profit-taking behavior around that mark and the exit of both long-term and short-term holders near the peak, this led to a steep decline in the ETH price.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Netflow Becomes Positive\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has climbed to $53,000, but Ethereum has outpaced BTC\u2019s gains, reaching $3,000 for the first time in almost two years. These price increases have put highly leveraged traders on alert, leading to total liquidations of around $300 million.\n\nYet, Ethereum\u2019s price is now undergoing a significant drop as many investors sold their stakes near the $3,000 peak. Notably, Ethereum saw total liquidations nearing $8.6 million, with a substantial $8.5 million of those being buyer liquidations. The week started off on a slower note, but Bitcoin made an aggressive move to $53,000, hitting this level for the first time since late 2021.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that the Netflow metric for ETH has moved into the positive territory, indicating that the volume of inflows now exceeds that of outflows. This shift points to a rise in exchange reserves, increasing the likelihood of sales and thus exerting downward pressure near resistance levels. The Netflow metric currently registers at +20,470 ETH.\n\nMoreover, the volume of large transactions has doubled recently, jumping from a low of 1.08 million ETH to 2.26 million ETH. This increase signals a rise in activity by major investors or \u201cwhales.\u201d In the event of such a market rejection, these whales could lose confidence, potentially triggering a wave of selling pressure that may drive the ETH price down to its immediate support levels.\n\nHowever, the bullish sentiment continues as ETH\u2019s network is poised for a pivotal enhancement called \u201cDencun,\u201d scheduled for March. This update is set to deploy \u201cproto-danksharding\u201d to the blockchain, which is expected to boost its performance and lower transaction fees.\n\nA Bloomberg analyst has projected a potential rise in ether\u2019s value to $4,000, drawing parallels with bitcoin\u2019s rally preceding the approval of spot ETFs. On the other hand, TD Cowen and JPMorgan express skepticism; TD Cowen questions the immediate approval of spot ether ETFs by the SEC, while JPMorgan assigns a probability of less than 50% for such approval by May.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For ETH Price?\n\nEther rebounded off the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that buyers are attempting to solidify this level as a foundation of support. Consequently, this boosted the buyers\u2019 confidence, enabling them to surpass the immediate Fibonacci retracement levels and break past the $3,000 mark. Currently, the price of ETH stands at $2,948, marking an increase of over 1.1% from the previous day\u2019s value.\n\nAlthough the price managed to breach the immediate barrier of $3,000, it couldn\u2019t maintain its surge as sellers initiated a pullback. Nonetheless, buyers are keen on maintaining the upward momentum with hopes of driving the price towards the critical resistance level at $3,100. Achieving this could set the stage for a move towards $3,500.\n\nThe recent price rejection has plunged the Relative Strength Index (RSI) toward 58, hinting at the possibility of a minor correction or a consolidation phase looming. For a short-term peak to be indicated, sellers would have to send the price below the 20-day EMA."

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s Dave LaValle recently claimed that an Ethereum spot ETF now stands a 50/50 chance of an SEC approval in May following Gary Gensler\u2019s BTC approval last month.\n\nAt a recent annual ETF conference, crypto took center stage, with executives from the world\u2019s largest financial and investment firms all interested in a piece of the crypto pie.\n\nAs BlackRock and Fidelity have dominated the Bitcoin ETF inflows with billions of dollars between them, the significance of Grayscale and its role in making the ETFs a reality seems lost on many. However, it was the crypto asset manager that forced the SEC to rethink its denial, and according to one Grayscale executive, Gary Gensler could yet again hand crypto another major win with an Ethereum ETF approval in a few months.\n\nAt the recent Exchange ETF Conference in Miami Beach, Florida, industry leaders from BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Invesco and other ETF giants took to the stage to discuss the latest trends in the market. Unlike in all the previous editions, this year\u2019s event had a new trending topic\u2013cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nDave LaValle, the Senior Managing Director and Global Head of ETFs at Grayscale, was among the speakers in a panel discussing the Bitcoin ETFs launched last month. He expressed his confidence that an Ethereum ETF would be next, saying there was a \u201950/50\u2032 chance that Gensler would approve one in May.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Dave LaValle, #Grayscale ETFs honcho, predicts a 50/50 shot for #SEC approval on #Ethereum ETF conversion to spot #ETH ETF in May! \ud83d\udcc8 Meanwhile, a #BitcoinETF rep reveals some advisors still can't shout out #Bitcoin to clients! \ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/RmszNv42cr pic.twitter.com/5EvDP0ESMI \u2014 Marcel Knobloch aka Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) February 21, 2024\n\nThe crypto ETF success came about because Grayscale took the SEC to court after the agency denied its application, accusing the regulator of \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct. This legal battle inevitably arose during the panel, with the moderator asking LaValle if Grayscale would sue the SEC again if it denied its Ethereum ETF.\n\nAccording to LaValle, the crypto asset manager can\u2019t rule out this approach, but it would first \u201chave to wait and see and look at the facts.\u201d\n\nGrayscale Confident Ethereum ETF is Coming\n\nLaValle isn\u2019t the only one confident that an Ethereum spot ETF is coming. Brock Pierce, the founder of the Bitcoin Foundation and one of the people behind the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, Tether, also believes that Gensler will give the green light soon.\n\nHe told Fox Business:\n\nI believe an Ethereum ETF should be in the works. The applications are there and with this precedent established, it\u2019s only a matter of time before an Ethereum ETF would exist. It clearly has the market cap and there\u2019s the demand, and I think retail investors would like the easy accessibility. The American people deserve easy access to the products they want to invest in.\n\nBut while the market guesses when the Ethereum spot ETF will debut, one thing is sure\u2014crypto ETFs are the next big thing. As of Feb. 20, BlackRock\u2019s BitcoinETF had attracted $5.4 billion, while Fidelity, in second place, had brought in $3.72 billion. Bitwise and Ark have also crossed the $1 billion threshold.\n\nAt the ETF Conference in Miami Beach, all the crypto panels were filled to the brim, with Galaxy Asset Management\u2019s Steve Kurz best capturing it when he said:\n\nI\u2019d be surprised in the next year if the top 10 wirehouses are not involved in this. We will probably see institutional FOMO.\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson thinks there is a likelihood that the ETHGate scandal is real.\n\nDuring a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson suggested that ETHGate could be real.\n\n\u201cI never once said that ETHGate didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he remarked.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHoskinson stated that it is possible that someone from Ethereum might have bribed certain officials at the SEC to give ETH a pass.\n\nPer Hoskinson, establishing relationships with top regulators to get favorable regulations is not a new practice. He mentioned that most entities outside the crypto space also engage in such acts.\n\nWhile there is a chance that ETHGate is real, Hoskinson noted that the theory has no relevance to Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nETHGate Scandal\n\nFor context, ETHGate has been a major topic of discussion for years. The theory involves allegations suggesting that certain members of the Ethereum core team established relationships with notable figures at the SEC to give ETH a regulatory edge over other crypto assets.\n\nPioneers of these theories believe that this relationship prompted former director of SEC\u2019s Corporation of Finance William Hinman to declare ETH as a non-security during his infamous speech in June 2018.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, Hoskinson has previously highlighted the possibility of someone from Ethereum bribing the SEC to give ETH a free pass.\n\nHowever, he denied having direct knowledge about the incident since he left Ethereum during its early days to establish Cardano.\n\nHostilities Between Hoskinson and XRP Community Lingers\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson\u2019s comments regarding the ETHGate scandal have birthed a lot of controversies, creating hostilities between him and XRP community members.\n\nAccording to Hoskinson, XRP community members have given a different meaning to ETHGate. He noted that some XRP holders alleged that the ETHGate theory involves Ethereum officials bribing the SEC to sue crypto payments company Ripple.\n\nThe Cardano founder labeled the allegation as a grand conspiracy, noting that there is no evidence to support the claim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely separate subject from Ethereum taking care of its own interest and trying to find relationships to help steer along a regulatory interpretation in their favor like most entities do,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s a different conversation that somebody from the Ethereum side or otherwise gave money or did something for a regulator to go after you, the XRP people. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe feud between Hoskinson and the XRP community has lingered for years, with Hoskinson taking steps to end it. Last year, he publicly sought peace to end the hostilities.\n\nHowever, his peace attempts yielded no results, as both parties continued to hurl derogatory comments at each other."

        "content": "SPONSORED POST*\n\nGet ready for a whirlwind tour of the cryptoverse! Today\u2019s update features Polkadot\u2019s steady climb, Ethereum\u2019s ambitious $3,000 target, and the explosive rise of Kangamoon, a unique meme coin shaking things up. Buckle up, because we\u2019re diving deep into the world of digital assets!\n\nPolkadot (DOT) Price Update: Stable with Room to Grow\n\nCompared to other cryptos, Polkadot hasn\u2019t seen wild swings in price lately. This past Saturday, it did experience a slight dip of around 2.38%, bringing its price down to $7.59. However, Polkadot (DOT) has been pretty steady.\n\nExperts consider Polkadot\u2019s volatility moderate, ranking it 34th among other cryptos. This suggests a steadier price movement compared to some riskier options. Looking ahead, things seem positive for Polkadot. Experts believe there\u2019s room for its price to climb before facing significant selling pressure. Currently trading at $7.78, Polkadot has support at $7.36, giving it some buffer before potential drops.\n\nThus, while not increasing, Polkadot does appear to be in a good position for potential growth with moderate volatility. This makes it an option for those seeking a more stable crypto investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Eyes $3,000 as Beacon Chain Locks Grow\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on a roll. Reaching a new peak for 2024 at $2,827 at press time, it fueled hopes of hitting the $3,000 mark soon. Adding to the excitement, a significant portion (25%) of all circulating Ethereum is now locked in the ETH 2.0 beacon chain, showcasing investors\u2019 faith in the future.\n\nBut can the momentum hold? Experts believe so. If Ethereum surpasses the initial hurdle at $2,850, $3,000 could be next. However, there\u2019s been a slight pullback today, with the price currently at $2,773, down slightly from yesterday\u2019s high.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway? Ethereum is bullish, and $3,000 seems achievable. The strong investor commitment through ETH 2.0 adds fuel to the fire.\n\n100x Potential? Kangamoon Combines P2E with Meme Coin Craze\n\nThe video game market is booming, projected to hit a staggering $583 billion by 2030! However, most meme coins just float on hype, offering little real value. Kangamoon is not your average meme coin. It\u2019s a revolution, merging the best of social media, gaming, and blockchain technology. This will create a dynamic, engaging ecosystem fueled by fun, rewards, and community.\n\nTired of waiting for exchange listings just to access tokens? The project will reward active participation. With this project you can dive into the platform\u2019s gaming world, complete challenges, and earn KANG tokens directly. It will be a playground, where you can even design your own avatar and digital assets to stand out. Feeling less adventurous? No worries!

The KANG token is exempt from transaction taxes, making it an even more attractive option. Furthermore, the presale is happening now, offering an entry point at just $0.005, with the price expected to rise as the presale progresses.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Stage 1 presale tokens are already gone, showcasing massive investor interest. Experts predict a potential 220% value increase for KANG during the presale, and a 35X project valuation boost by the end of 2024.\n\nKANG is more than just a meme coin. It\u2019s a vibrant community, a rewarding gaming experience, and a potential investment powerhouse. Ready to join the revolution?

        "content": "The first quarter of 2024 will be a wild ride for many altcoins, such as Near Protocol (NEAR) and Ethereum (ETH). Today, we look at some price predictions for these hot tokens. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls (MGLS) - a Stage 5 presale star, has been making waves in the meme coin space. Many analysts even have it pegged as the next 100x meme coin in 2024. Let\u2019s see why.\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR): Price Soars Around 22%\n\nRecently, Near Protocol (NEAR) has been showing bullish signs. For instance, the Near Protocol price increased from $2.90 to $3.53 in the past 30 days. Its market cap also grew from $2.91B to $3.67B in that time. Not only that, Near Protocol experienced 17/30 green trading days.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, this number will increase as Near Protocol trades above its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Furthermore, this altcoin has 24 technical indicators in the green. Because of this, experts in the crypto field have made a bullish Near Protocol price prediction. They forecast a surge to $4.95 within Q1 of 2024 for NEAR.\n\nMeme Moguls (MGLS): To Rule the Meme Coin Market\n\nThe Meme Moguls (MGLS) presale is garnering a significant amount of attention and investment. This project has already raised nearly $2.5M in its presale performance, aiming to make waves in the booming meme coin sector. With real utility and an experienced team behind it, there is no reason why MGLS cannot become a blue-chip token.\n\nWhat sets Meme Moguls apart is its commitment to blending meme coin dynamics with tangible utility. Unlike most meme coins, MGLS serves a dual purpose as a governance token and the in-game currency for the upcoming Meme Moguls play-to-earn (P2E) game.\n\nIn the P2E game, players will participate in virtual stock trading experiences, gaining insights into wealth-building and investments. They may even try to \u201cBeat the Market\u201d - a game mode where you can compete against indexes like the S&P 500.\n\nThe Meme Moguls ecosystem is built on the MGLS token. Currently priced at $0.0036 during Stage 5 of its presale, early adopters are already up by 90%. And since it\u2019s set to be listed on Uniswap in Q1 2024, experts are predicting a 100x pump. At this moment, there\u2019s also a 30% deposit bonus, which adds to the overall appeal of this game-changing meme coin.\n\nMicha\u00ebl Van De Poppe Announces a Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has also been making headlines. For instance, crypto analyst Micha\u00ebl Van De Poppe remains bullish for this altcoin. In other words, Poppe made a new tweet stating that a price increase would come after the Dencun upgrade or from a short-term peak of BTC. He claims that Ethereum will also reclaim 0.06.\n\nIn terms of the Ethereum price movement, it has jumped from $2,488 to $2,901 in the past week alone. Its market cap also grew from $299B to $348B during that time. Additionally, Ethereum is now trading above its 100 and 200-day EMAs. As a result, experts predict that this altcoin will hit $3,629 within Q1 of 2024.\n\nCan Meme Moguls Outpace Near Protocol and Ethereum?\n\nMeme Moguls hold a solid chance of outpacing giants like Near Protocol and Ethereum. With a modest market cap of $10.8M, Meme Moguls can reach heights faster by requiring fewer new funds. Thus, MGLS is one of the best meme coins to invest in if you wish to see fast returns.\n\nVisit Meme Moguls"

        "content": "Cardano (ADA) is a \u201cshitcoin\u201d without purpose that has no distinct advantage over competitors, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.\n\n\u201cWho gives a fuck? Zero?\u201d said Hayes when asked \u201cWhat about Cardano?\u201d in an interview with Coin Bureau published on Sunday.\n\nCardano Is A Shitcoin, Says Hayes\n\nContinuing to describe the cryptocurrency \u2013 a top ten digital asset by market cap \u2013 Hayes did not mince words: \u201cThe first wannabe Ethereum, and probably the first one to go to be irrelevant,\u201d he said.\n\nTypically, the popular crypto essayist and trader is well known as one of the loudest long-term Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) bulls, and often expresses interest in small-cap cryptos for short-term trading.\n\nDuring the same interview, Hayes even expressed interest in the memecoin \u201cdogwifhat\u201d calling it the \u201cbest dog money of this bull cycle.\n\n\u201cI love Rare Pepe\u2019s\u2026 I think we\u2019re going to see a resurgence of NFT trading volumes,\u201d he added.\n\nThe writer\u2019s unique callout of Cardano ruffled some feathers online \u2013 especially with the network\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson. On Tuesday, Hoskinson asked Hayes why he was \u201cthrowing shade\u201d at Cardano.\n\n\u201cCause your coin is a piece of shit man,\u201d Hayes replied. \u201cJust buy some ETH and chill.\u201d\n\nWhat Makes Cardano Unique?\n\nMuch like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform for developing decentralized applications. It also popularized as one of the first well-developed proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, which use crypto rather than energy to secure its network.\n\nHowever, many popular blockchains today now use the same mechanism, with Ethereum undergoing a massive upgrade in 2022 to adopt proof of stake. In terms of both market size and DeFi TVL, Cardano is still outsized by competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Hayes published a list of the world\u2019s most popular Dapps, and asked which of them had originated or grown most popular on the Cardano blockchain.\n\n\u201cFrom my very limited knowledge, it looks like none of them do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why ADA is dog shit.\u201d\n\nOn Bitcoin, however, Hayes remains a bull, expecting strong money printing from the Federal Reserve to drive the asset\u2019s price up soon.\n\n\u201cWhen printing money happens and you debase the value of time and human labor, we rejoice and say great, fuck you, we\u2019re gonna take Bitcoin to a million,\u201d he told Coin Bureau.\n\nLate last year, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would reach between $750,000 and $1 million by the end of 2026."

        "content": "Interest in altcoins and other digital assets is on the rise, propelled by growing confidence in the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a new study conducted by Nickel Digital Asset Management, a prominent Europe-based digital assets hedge fund manager.\n\nThis surge in optimism has led a significant majority of institutional investors and wealth managers to predict an increased demand for various digital assets. The research, which involved participants from the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates managing approximately $815 billion in assets, highlights the optimistic outlook for cryptocurrency markets, even exceeding initial expectations for 2024.\n\nThe findings reveal that 83% of the surveyed financial experts are anticipating that the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum will boost interest in altcoins. Additionally, 72% are confident that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 price point, although opinions vary on the timeframe for this milestone, with half of the optimists expecting it to happen within the next five years.\n\nSurveys conducted in January 2024 had investors forecasting Bitcoin to reach $45,000 by year's end, yet the cryptocurrency has already exceeded $51,000, outstripping many predictions. Similarly, Ethereum's current value has surpassed the anticipated $2,500 mark, highlighting the accelerated growth and early achievement of year-end forecasts for the digital currency market. Currently, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has already exceeded the $1.4 trillion level predicted by 60% of respondents, standing just under $2 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnatoly Crachilov, CEO and Founding Partner of Nickel Digital, shared insights on the momentum gathered in the early part of the year, driven by a broad-based demand for Bitcoin, especially following a successful ETF launch. Crachilov noted, \"The confidence of institutional investors in market growth in 2024 is striking, but even this optimism got eclipsed by the actual growth in the first weeks of the year.\" He further elaborated on the potential ripple effects on the broader digital asset market, suggesting that altcoins, particularly those with smart contract capabilities, are poised for significant growth due to their innovative use cases and smaller market capitalizations. This dynamic could result in altcoins outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum over the investment cycle, propelled by incremental investments."

        "title": "Analyzing the Relationship Between Ethereum Price and Futures Contracts - NewsDay",
        "content": "urethium\n\nAre you puzzled by how Ethereum prices seem to dance with the rhythm of futures contracts? A recent surge in cryptocurrency trading has propelled Ethereum futures into the spotlight.\n\nThis article peels back the layers to reveal how these financial instruments can sway the value of your digital assets. Stick around \u2013 it's simpler than you think!\n\nFutures contracts are deals to buy or sell Ethereum at a future date, affecting its price.\n\nThe contango effect can lead to higher future prices for Ethereum than the current price.\n\nGlobal economic conditions like inflation can change how people use Ethereum futures.\n\nComparing Ethereum's futures market with other cryptocurrencies shows different trends and investor types.\n\nFor smart trading, it's key to watch market makers and how they adjust their positions in response to the economy.\n\nFutures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date, providing traders with the ability to hedge against price fluctuations. The contango effect, where future prices are higher than spot prices, can impact Ethereum futures contracts and their role in the market.\n\nA futures contract is a deal to buy or sell something at a set price on a future date. Investors use these contracts to lock in prices and hedge against the risk of price changes. These agreements are standard tools for market movements, including those involving cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.\n\nTraders rely on technical indicators and analysis to predict how Ethereum's price will fluctuate due to these contracts. They use futures to bet on the cryptocurrency's value, which can push its price up or down.\n\nFutures play a big role in setting expectations about where Ethereum's price might be going.\n\nFutures contracts play a crucial role in the market by allowing investors to lock in prices for assets at a future date. They serve as a risk management tool, enabling participants to hedge against price fluctuations.\n\nThe availability of futures contracts also provides liquidity and price transparency in the market, attracting both institutional and retail investors.\n\nMoreover, futures contracts help in price discovery by reflecting market expectations and sentiments. They provide valuable insights into future asset prices based on supply and demand dynamics, influencing investment decisions and overall market stability.\n\nThe contango effect can impact Ethereum futures contracts, leading to higher future prices than the current spot price. This occurs when market participants anticipate increased demand for Ethereum in the future due to various factors like inflation expectations or market dynamics.\n\nAs a result, investors may use futures contracts to hedge against potential price increases and secure favorable positions in anticipation of rising Ethereum prices.\n\nAnalyzing the contango effect is crucial for understanding how it influences Ethereum futures contracts and their pricing dynamics. By closely monitoring this phenomenon, traders can make informed decisions about their positions and effectively navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency futures market.\n\nFutures contracts have a significant impact on the price dynamics of Ethereum, with global economic conditions playing a crucial role in shaping the futures market for this cryptocurrency.\n\nComparing Ethereum with other major cryptocurrencies in the futures market can provide valuable insights into its pricing behavior and market trends.\n\nFutures contracts play a pivotal role in influencing Ethereum's price dynamics. Market indicators analysis reveals how the trading activity in futures contracts can impact Ethereum's valuation, leading to significant price fluctuations.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the perpetual futures contract funding rate helps predict price movements, enabling traders to make informed decisions and hedge against inflation.\n\nCryptocurrency futures contracts introduce volatility into the market as market makers strategically navigate neutral trading positions. Analyzing the influence of global economic conditions on Ethereum's futures contracts provides insights into how external factors shape its price trajectory compared to other major cryptocurrencies in the ETF market dynamics.\n\nGlobal economic conditions heavily influence Ethereum futures contracts. Economic volatility can lead to increased demand for Ethereum futures as investors seek to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.\n\nFor instance, during periods of uncertainty or high inflation, the demand for Ethereum futures may surge as they offer a way to protect against potential losses in traditional markets.\n\nMarket makers utilize technical analysis techniques to predict price movements based on global economic factors. They strategically adjust their positions in response to these conditions which impacts the liquidity and pricing of Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nEthereum's performance in the futures market often contrasts with that of other major cryptocurrencies. This table summarizes key differences and comparisons:\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nMarket Capitalization\n\nFutures Contracts Volume\n\nPrice Volatility\n\nTypical Futures Market Participants\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nHigh\n\nSignificant\n\nHigh\n\nInstitutional and Retail Investors\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nHighest\n\nExtremely High\n\nComparatively Lower than ETH\n\nMainly Institutional Investors\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nModerate\n\nModerate\n\nModerate to High\n\nMixed, with More Retail Participation\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLower\n\nLower\n\nHigh\n\nRetail Investors\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nLower\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nRetail and Some Institutional Investors\n\nEthereum attracts a significant volume of futures trading, reflecting both its high market cap and volatility. By comparison, the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, commands the most attention from institutional investors with an extremely high futures contracts volume. Other cryptocurrencies like Ripple, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash see varying levels of engagement in the futures market, often with a larger retail investor base. Ethereum's futures market, therefore, serves as an important gauge for investor sentiment and market dynamics among its peers.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the relationship between Ethereum price and futures contracts is crucial for investors. The influence of global economic conditions on Ethereum futures contracts requires careful analysis.\n\nBy studying market maker strategies and predicting price movements, one can effectively navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency futures contracts. As Ethereum continues to evolve in the futures market, evaluating contract topology and hedging against inflation becomes increasingly significant for informed decision-making."

        "content": "The Ethereum (ETH) price has crossed the $3,000 threshold for the first time since April 2022 yesterday. However, amidst the celebratory fireworks in the crypto community, Fred Krueger, a renowned Bitcoin ETF expert, has voiced a starkly contrasting opinion. Krueger, a Wall Street veteran and prop trader, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his skepticism about the current valuation of ETH, stating, \u201cETH is completely detached from reality.\u201d\n\nWhy Ethereum Is \u201cCompletely Detached From Reality\u201d\n\nKrueger\u2019s comments come at a time when the crypto market is witnessing a resurgence in investor interest, with Ethereum at the forefront due to its recent price rally. Despite this, Krueger points out a concerning trend in the usage of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nETH is completely detached from reality. A deep dive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 ETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, and that this number is only going up, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K\u2026 pic.twitter.com/141GwtB0yz \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) February 21, 2024\n\n\u201cETH is at $3,000. Surely this must mean that a ton of people are using ETH, right? Nope. Eth, the chain has dropped from 120K active daily users in 2021, to just 66K over the last year. The top app, Uniswap V3 is only getting 16K DAUs. I remember, back in 2020 this number was 60K or more,\u201d he noted, emphasizing a decline in the platform\u2019s direct utility and engagement.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Receives Nod Of Approval From Berstein: ETH Price Will Reach $10,000 7 months ago\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF expert further criticized the valuation of Ethereum, drawing parallels to meme coins like Shiba Inu due to its inflated market cap, which stands at $361 billion despite the fall in active users. \u201cIt really has become a type of meme coin, similar to Shiba Inu,\u201d Krueger remarked, pointing to the stark contrast between Ethereum\u2019s high market cap and its diminishing direct use.\n\nKrueger argues that Ethereum is not only overvalued but also faces stiff competition from other blockchains that outperform it in terms of transaction costs and speed. \u201cIt\u2019s not particularly cheap ($1.50 per transaction), or fast. If you are just interested in reward points for games, or casino-style DeFi apps \u2014 Solana, Avalanche, Near etc.. all crush it.\u201d\n\nKrueger also expressed skepticism about the future regulatory landscape for Ethereum, particularly concerning the potential for an ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF). \u201cFinally, I don\u2019t think Gensler is going to allow an ETH ETF\u2026 I just don\u2019t think Gary wants to make his second ETF a massive pre-mine. Sets a very bad precedent,\u201d he stated, reflecting on the challenges Ethereum faces in gaining mainstream financial acceptance.\n\nThe Crypto Community Reacts\n\nIn response to Krueger\u2019s critical take, the crypto community on X provided mixed reactions. One user challenged Krueger\u2019s analysis by pointing to Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric roadmap and the misleading nature of using mainnet daily active users (DAU) as a metric for the platform\u2019s health. Krueger, however, remained unconvinced, stating, \u201cEven L2s like Arbitrum have been in decline for the last 12 months. This is not the case that all is well in ETH-land.\u201d\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnother user attempted to highlight the cyclical nature of DeFi and the broader crypto market, suggesting that the current downturn is a temporary phase of risk aversion. Yet, Krueger dismissed these arguments, reiterating his lack of interest in speculative DeFi activities and emphasizing his belief in Bitcoin as the true revolutionary cryptocurrency. \u201cI am not interested in degen ape games. Have fun,\u201d he stated.\n\nKrueger\u2019s critique extends beyond Ethereum to the broader landscape of cryptocurrencies, questioning the long-term viability and value proposition of altcoins, including Layer 1 solutions other than Bitcoin. He argues that these platforms are unlikely to become significant value generators in the long term, likening their control mechanisms to fiat currencies but with central figures like Vitalik Buterin in place of traditional central bankers.\n\nKrueger\u2019s overall stance on Ethereum and the broader crypto market is clear. \u201cMy position on ETH. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is the revolution\u2026 Every other cryptocurrency is fighting for some other much smaller use case,\u201d he explained, underscoring his belief in Bitcoin\u2019s unique value proposition as a decentralized, finite currency system.\n\nAt press time, the ETH price surpassed the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (at $2,922), trading at $2,935. A weekly close above this threshold could confirm another leg up for the ETH price.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"

        "content": "Amid a bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency sector, which has pushed its representative asset, Bitcoin (BTC), over the $50,000 price threshold, things have been going great for the largest altcoin by market capitalization \u2013 Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 and investors are wondering if five figures could be in store this year.\n\nAs it happens, the recent market optimism has pushed Ethereum closer to the psychologically important price level of $3,000, and breaking through this barrier could give it enough strength to continue further, possibly making a new all-time high (ATH) and perhaps even ending up in the $10,000 range.\n\nWill Ethereum hit $10,000?\n\nThat said, such a significant price increase would not be possible without other important factors falling into place, including the upcoming launch of Proto-Danksharding, as observed by Simon Dedic, the CEO of blockchain advisory and investment firm Moonrock Capital, on February 20.\n\nSpecifically, proto-danksharding, a.k.a proposal EIP-4844, which should launch in mid-March 2024, refers to a new type of transaction on Ethereum that accepts \u2018blobs\u2019 of data to persist in the beacon node for a short period of time, with blobs \u201csmall enough to keep disk use manageable,\u201d according to the team.\n\nAt @EthereumDenver we hacked together a full data-blob-transaction prototype! (a.k.a. mini-danksharding)\n\n\n\nData blobs are the first milestone towards full ethereum sharding, enabling rollups like @optimismPBC to grow 100x in capacity.\n\n\n\nHere's a tweet thread about the prototype \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 proto.eth (@protolambda) February 20, 2022\n\nOn top of that, the network is looking at a possible approval of its spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, which would lead to massive inflows and possibly contribute to an increase in the price of its native token.\n\nFurthermore, Dedic stressed the launch of EigenLayer and re-staking, which will \u201ctake a ton of ETH supply out of circulation,\u201d thanks to allowing users to use their staked ETH as cryptoeconomic security for protocols other than Ethereum, in exchange for protocol fees and rewards,\u201d the team said.\n\nFinally, the Moonrock Capital CEO highlighted Ethereum\u2019s deflationary tokenomics (its value increases due to a reduction or stagnation in supply) and the possible non-fungible token (NFT) craze coming back at some point with the return of the \u201cmainstream mania.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, he believes that Ethereum, out of all blue chips, is best positioned for the next two years \u201cin terms of supply/demand ratio given the future supply sinks and reflexivity\u201d and \u201c5 digits is programmed imo,\u201d Dedic said, referring to the possibility of Ethereum hitting $10,000.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum price today is currently trading at $2,934.6, up 0.68% in the last 24 hours, as well as gaining 8.15% across the previous seven days, and adding up to the accumulated increase of 21.87% on its monthly chart, as per the most recent ETH price data retrieved on February 21.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, Ethereum is in a great position to significantly increase its price in 2024 and perhaps even reach a new ATH. However, $10,000 might be overly optimistic for this year, and even an ETH bull like Dedic gives it a two-year window for five figures to enter the narrative.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "A crypto investor, Fred Krueger, thinks Ethereum is overvalued at spot rates. Referring to X, Krueger added that Ethereum supporters are \u201cdetached from reality\u201d after ETH, the native currency, recently broke above $3,000.\n\nThe investor pointed to the general declining on-chain activity, fierce competition from alternatives like Solana and Avalanche, for instance, and regulatory uncertainty that makes holding the coin risky.\n\nEthereum Is Slow And Usage Is Shrinking\n\nKrueger argues that Ethereum\u2019s on-chain transactions could be faster and cheaper. In the current landscape marked with scalable and low-fee alternatives, either built on Ethereum or existing as independent chains, the chain\u2019s challenges no longer justify ETH trading at spot rates of about $3,000.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAVAX Slips, Adding Tension To $365 Million Avalanche Token Unlock Drama 7 months ago\n\nBeyond scaling and throughput challenges, the investor also refers to the sharp decline in daily active users (DAUs) on the mainnet. Since 2021, Ethereum and altcoin prices have peaked, and active DAUs have fallen from around 120,000 to approximately 66,000 in February 2024.\n\nThough network supporters said there had been developments like layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum pinning their security on Ethereum, Krueger notes that even the most active and largest protocols by total value locked (TVL) have seen user losses.\n\nTo illustrate, Uniswap V3, the third version of one of Ethereum\u2019s largest decentralized exchanges, Uniswap, now records around 16,000 daily active users, significantly lower than previous years.\n\nAlternatives Like Solana Offer Better: Is ETH Expensive?\n\nThe investor argues that the decline in DAUs, pointing to active usage, sharply contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s rising market capitalization and spot rates. In Krueger\u2019s opinion, this emerging state of affairs is why Ethereum has become a bloated \u201cmeme coin like Shiba Inu,\u201d looking at its high market cap.\n\nIt in the investor\u2019s assessment that faster and cheaper alternatives like Solana, Avalanche, and Near Protocol offer better value for specific use cases like decentralized finance (DeFi) and games.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nKrueger also took issue with the lack of regulatory clarity on Ethereum. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) batch. Primarily, this is because SEC officials recognize Bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nGary Gensler and the SEC have failed to classify ETH in the same category as BTC. Accordingly, though the broader crypto community is optimistic about the eventual authorization of a spot Ethereum ETF, Krueger thinks it is unlikely.\n\nStill, time will only tell how Ethereum and its market valuation will evolve in the coming months. Supporters are optimistic, despite criticism, that rising adoption and ETH\u2019s deflationary nature will lift prices towards 2021 highs of $5,000.\n\nFeature image from DALLE, chart from TradingView"

        "content": "The Merge NFT is a unique dynamic NFT collection that was created by a digital artist called Murat Pak and featured on the leading NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in December 2021.\n\nThe collection that commemorates Ethereum\u2019s transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism netted over $91.8 million during its brief 48-hour sale. This makes The Merge not only the most expensive NFT collection ever sold, but also the most expensive art piece sold by a living artist on a public sale.\n\nThe artwork that accompanied The Merge NFT drop on Nifty Gateway. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is The Merge NFT and how does it work?\n\nThe Merge is a unique and dynamic Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) collection that made headlines and broke sales records in December 2021. After the sale was concluded, Nifty Gateway minted all 312,686 purchased tokens, also referred to as units of \u201cmass\u201d.\n\nWe're kicking off minting of mass tonight, anyone who purchased mass should see their NFT within the next few hours. We will also be putting a hold on moving mass out of your accounts momentarily to make the secondary market fair for everyone \u26ab\ufe0f @muratpak pic.twitter.com/bkdXu4uFFU \u2014 Nifty Gateway ? (@niftygateway) December 7, 2021\n\nThe artworks of The Merge NFTs are very basic as each token is represented by a simple white or yellow circle on a black background. The visuals are generated fully on-chain based on the formulas included in the smart contracts and not hosted off-chain as is the case with many other NFT collections.\n\nWhat sets The Merge apart from all other NFT collections is the concept behind the collection, which utilizes a unique mechanism that causes the collection to change and develop over time. The collection\u2019s smart contract prevents one address from holding multiple NFTs from the Merge collections \u2013 as soon as two NFTs from the collection are held in the same wallet, the masses of the two tokens merge. The result is one newly minted NFT with the combined mass of both pre-existing NFTs, which is depicted by a bigger circle on a black background.\n\nThe Merge NFTs in circulation diminishes as they are transferred between wallets (more precisely, bought by someone who already holds an NFT from the collection in the wallet), and their average mass increases. The total mass, however, remains constant.\n\nAn illustrative artwork depicting the merging of two mass tokens on the left and an equation explaining how the merging principle works on the right. Image source: niftygateway.com\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Merge?\n\nAs already mentioned, The Merge NFT collection commemorates the Ethereum Merge, which was a historical event in Ethereum\u2019s history that concluded the network's transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThe transition process started with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, also known as the Serenity upgrade, on December 1, 2021, when the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain (the chain that currently acts as the central coordination layer for the entire Ethereum 2.0 network) was activated. While ETH 2.0 staking deposits were enabled shortly after, the PoS and the PoW networks ran simultaneously up until September 15, 2022, when the transition concluded with The Merge event. Since then, the Ethereum network is secured solely by staking.\n\nThe move to proof-of-stake enabled Ethereum to address its scalability issues, which often caused extraordinary spikes in gas prices while the network still relied on PoW. In addition, the network had become more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable as the energy consumption was reduced by more than 99% when the PoW chain was made obsolete.\n\nHow much money The Merge NFT sold for in December 2021?\n\nThe Merge NFTs were sold in an open edition style (the opposite of a limited edition sale) from December 2 to December 4, 2021. The starting price for the public sale of The Merge tokens was set at $575 per unit, with the price increasing by $25 every 6 hours, so the ones who bought the tokens in the last few hours of the sale had to cash out $750 per token. The number of tokens each participant could acquire was unlimited.\n\nThe Merge NFT sale saw participation from 29,983 unique address owners who bought a total of 312,686 tokens. The Merge NFT sale ended up netting an exceptional sum of $91.8 million. This crowns The Merge NFT as the most expensive artwork ever publicly sold by a living artist.\n\nNevertheless, this record is a bit controversial as it is only valid if we consider the whole collection as a single piece of art. While many claim that The Merge is actually a collection of artworks, it could one day, if all the NFTs are merged in one wallet, become one NFT and thereby one single unique art piece.\n\nHow much is The Merge NFT worth now?\n\nSince its initial sale, the price of The Merge NFTs has fallen significantly. At the time of writing, one unit of mass has a floor price of $125, which is about 0.0428 ETH. Using this floor price puts the total market capitalization of the NFTs in circulation at slightly below 803 ETH (worth around $2.3 million).\n\nStill, quite a few tokens get sold above the floor price, which means that the total value of the whole collection would likely be higher in the end. In addition, the price of an NFT from The Merge collection also depends on its mass. There are currently 8,210 unique addresses that are holding The Merge NFT, meaning that there are only that many distinctive NFTs in circulation and many of them have a mass larger than 1.\n\nTop 4 The Merge NFTs with the largest mass that are currently being sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT marketplace and their respectful ask prices.

Ethereum development studio ConsenSys has released a collection called The Merge: Regenesis, which was also designed to celebrate Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe collection was available for minting over a period of 72 hours and features three types of artworks, each commemorating one aspect of Ethereum's move to PoS: scalability, security and sustainability.\n\nDue to the sheer amount of NFTs minted, this collection has a very low floor price of only about 0.0007 ETH ($2.05 at the time of writing).\n\nThe bottom line: The Merge is the most expensive NFT collection ever sold\n\nAlthough The Merge NFT collection is not as valuable as it used to be when it was initially dropped on the Nifty Gateway marketplace, the sale of this unique dynamic NFT collection still represents a record-breaking event in the history of digital art and art in general. The Merge NFT collection sold for $91.8 million, surpassed Jeff Koons\u2019 sculpture titled \u201cRabbit,\u201d which sold for $91.1 million by a hair's breadth and became arguably the most expensive artwork sold publicly by a living artist.\n\nIn addition, The Merge NFT reigns on top of the list of the most expensive NFT collections. Even so, The Merge tokens have not made it to the list of the most expensive single NFTs ever sold just yet. Interesting and unique NFTs from collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, for example, have a tendency to soar much higher as far as the price of a single non-fungible token is concerned.\n\nWe will conclude this article with a hard snap back to reality as those of us without ETH holdings worth millions of dollars in our digital wallets would likely find an article on how to find and participate in free NFT drops much more useful."
