        "title": "Ethereum: Will fresh demand again push ETH past $4K? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "New demand for Ethereum now sits at a year-to-date high.\n\nIts DeFi and NFT sectors, however, witnessed declines in the past week.\n\nThe daily count of new addresses on Ethereum [ETH] assessed on a seven-day moving average reached a year-to-date (YTD) high of 116,000 on 14th March, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nThis marked a 35% increase from the 86,000 unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction of the native coin in the network on 1st January.\n\nEthereum\u2019s rally in new demand to a YTD high came amidst a surge in its on-chain volume. AMBCrypto found that transaction volume on the network, also assessed using a seven-day moving average, attained a YTD high of $7 billion on 11th March.\n\nAs transaction volume rallied, the average fee paid per transaction on the network also climbed. According to The Block\u2019s data, this reached a YTD high of $25 on 11th March.\n\nThe DeFi and NFT sector fails to react\n\nDespite the recent uptick in demand for the Ethereum network, its decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token ecosystems have witnessed declines.\n\nFor example, the total value of assets locked (TVL) across the DeFi protocols housed within the chain declined by 5% in the last week. Per DefiLlama\u2019s data, Ethereum\u2019s TVL was $53.4 billion.\n\nOut of the top 10 DeFi protocols on Ethereum, only one (ether.Fi) recorded a TVL hike in the past seven days. The rest of them witnessed a decline.\n\nThe network\u2019s NFT sector recorded a 21% decrease in sales volume in the last seven days.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlam\u2019s data, despite the 90% uptick in the number of traders trading NFTs on the network during that period, the transaction count fell by 2%.\n\nIn the last seven days, 166,000 NFT transactions worth $130 million were completed on the Ethereum network.\n\nLook before you leap\n\nThe network\u2019s native coin ETH sold for $3,721 at press time. Per CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, its value dropped by 6% in the last week. The decline followed a sharp fall in Bitcoin\u2019s value on 14th March, when its value was below $68,000.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAn assessment of ETH\u2019s performance on a daily chart revealed that its Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator has posted red upward-facing histogram bars since 11th March.\n\nAn asset\u2019s AO measures market trends and changes in momentum. When it displays red upward-facing bars, it suggests increasing negative momentum in the market. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or entering short positions."

        "content": "A widely followed analyst and trader is offering his forecast on three crypto assets.\n\nStarting with the fifth-largest crypto asset by market cap, the analyst pseudonymously known as Inmortal tells his 209,800 followers on the social media platform X that Solana (SOL) could replicate its rival Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) explosive rally from early 2020 to late 2021 and skyrocket by similar multiples.\n\nEthereum went up from the low of a price of just under $90 reached in March of 2020 to an all-time high price of just below $5,000 which was recorded in November of 2021.\n\nFrom the current price, Solana could go up by approximately 182% from the current level, according to Inmortal. If the fifth-largest crypto asset were to reach Inmortal\u2019s peak-of-the-cycle target, Solana would have recorded a 60x gain from the December of 2022 low.\n\n\u201cPrevious cycle ETH went from $80 to $4,800.\n\nThis cycle SOL will go from $8 to $480.\u201d\n\nTurning to Floki (FLOKI), Inmortal says that the memecoin is undergoing vertical accumulation, a situation where the price of an asset range-trades while gradually inching upwards.\n\nBased on the pseudonymous analyst\u2019s chart, it appears that Inmortal is suggesting that FLOKI could fall significantly after breaking above the all-time high of slightly under $0.00034 before going on to rally in a parabolic move.\n\nFLOKI is trading at $0.000247 at time of writing.\n\nNext up is the blockchain oracle Chainlink (LINK). According to the pseudonymous analyst, LINK could be preparing for the second wave of a rally.\n\nBased on Inmortal\u2019s chart, it appears that the analyst sees LINK rallying by around 68% from the current level to a price of $32.\n\nChainlink is trading at $19 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "A notable figure in the Shiba Inu community has established a connection between SHIB and Ethereum.\n\nIn a recent post on X, acclaimed crypto expert Del Crxpto attempted to forge a link between Shiba Inu and Ethereum, drawing on the co-founders of both projects.\n\nSpecifically, Del Crxpto recounted when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated multi-billion dollar worth of Shiba Inu to a COVID-19 relief effort. Del Crxpto claimed Shiba Inu ecosystem lead, Shytoshi Kusama, transferred the tokens to Buterin.\n\nThe $SHIB / $ETH Connection: Who remembers when @ShytoshiKusama sent Billions worth of $SHIB to @VitalikButerin, who used it for COVID-19 relief? Who remembers how the entire space just figured it was a coincidence? No one should be surprised by what the future holds\u2026 the\u2026 \u2014 Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) March 14, 2024\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEthereum and Shiba Inu Connection\n\nInterestingly, the COVID-19 relief initiative concerned Crypto Relief India, a crypto-based humanitarian endeavor.\n\nThe foundation received a staggering $1.5 billion in Shiba Inu from Vitalik Buterin to finance its COVID-19 relief effort. Accordingly, Crypto Relief India liquidated a portion of the Shiba Inu donation to raise $460 million.\n\nIn a separate development last year, Buterin contributed over $150,000 to a wallet endorsed by Shiba Inu\u2019s leader. The fund was directed towards aiding victims of earthquakes in Turkey. Moreover, the SHIB Army contributed to a charitable initiative Buterin established in response to the global pandemic.\n\nConsidering these developments, Del Crxpto prompted the SHIB Army to recollect how the broader community initially perceived the interaction between Kusama and Buterin as a mere coincidence.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn parallel, he emphasized that nobody should be taken aback by what the future holds for SHIB, asserting that \u201cthe signs were always there.\u201d In reaction, another Shiba Inu enthusiast echoed a similar sentiment, speculating:\n\n\n\n\u201cVitalik knows who created SHIB for sure\u2014the OG pic with \u2018supposedly\u2019 Shytoshi. Then, magically, billions were sent to his wallet. Like, how did they know that address\u2026\u201d\n\nEssentially, these voices sought to establish that Vitalik Buterin has more profound relationships with the Shiba Inu ecosystem than the public knows, suggesting SHIB is bound to follow ETH\u2019s success.\n\nSignificantly, in 2021, the Ethereum founder reportedly destroyed 90% of his Shiba Inu tokens, valued at over $6.5 billion, compounding the asset\u2019s growth. Buterin further pledged to contribute his remaining Shiba Inu tokens to charity causes."

        "content": "Stellar Lumens is set up to challenge Ethereum in the smart contract space after the launch of the Soroban project.\n\nThe Ripple rival is looking to dominate the market, and with the launch of the smart contracts platform and its innovative financial technology infrastructure, it is set up to lead its rivals.\n\nEarlier this year, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) confirmed the launch of the much-anticipated Soroban platform. Deployed through the \u201cProtocol 20\u201d upgrade, which was deemed the greatest upgrade since the launch of the Stellar Lumens network, this platform sees the network rival Ethereum.\n\nAs CNF reported, with the new Soroban project, the network will compete with Ethereum, which has been the leader in the smart contract space. It will further enable the network, which was primarily built as a payment blockchain, to attract developers, users, and new applications.\n\nWith the capability to host decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, this marks a new era for the Stellar blockchain. The network becomes a direct rival of Ethereum, which is regarded as the king of smart contracts and the platform for building them. Over the years, several blockchain platforms, including Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot, have challenged Ethereum, but none has been able to topple the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency project.\n\nBut with Stellar, this could be the greatest test for Ethereum yet. Stellar Lumens has already shown its superiority in financial applications. Often regarded as a Ripple rival, not only was it co-founded by a former Ripple co-founder, but it also sought to shake up the financial sector. Specifically, Stellar aims to bank the bankless, bringing financial solutions to those who lack access.\n\nAs highlighted by CNF, the project has recorded numerous successes in this regard. More recently, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has made a case for open banking innovations. In an open letter to the US Treasury, the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) responded to the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Request for Information on Financial Inclusion, emphasizing the importance of access and leveraging technology to advance financial inclusion efforts, supported by Stellar Lumens (XLM).\n\nWith the new upgrade, the project will look to lead the finance revolution with tokenization, digitizing real-world assets for faster transactions. The adoption of Soroban could be accelerated due to its working relationship with traditional financial institutions, including WisdomTree, Deloitte, Franklin Templeton, and Circle.\n\nGoing after Ripple and Ethereum, both of which are ranked higher by market cap, could be a big undertaking for Stellar. But it could offer a chance to become the only go-to network that encompasses everything a user and developer could want or need.\n\nAt the time of writing, XLM is trading at $0.13 after a drop in the past 24 hours. The token is now down by nearly 10% on the weekly chart. Although the altcoin is struggling to break out of its long-term bearish trend, popular crypto analyst EGRAG expresses optimism for Stellar (XLM) and foresees a rise to $5 due to its expanding potential.\n\nRecommended for you:\n\n[thrive_leads id=\"228374\"]"

Technicals suggest a continuation of the fall, amid a nose-diving Relative Strength Index (RSI), which suggests momentum is falling.\n\nThe histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are flashing green, a sign of the bears\u2019 having a strong presence in the BTC market. Additionally, the volume indicator is showing large red bars, showing the downtrend is gaining strength.\n\nBitcoin price could extend the fall, which means investors could still have an opportunity to buy lower before a strong move north ahead of the BTC halving.

To confirm the uptrend, investors must watch for a candlestick close above $64,044, the mean threshold of the supply zone between $71,290 and $73,193. Such a move would clear the path for BTC to reclaim the $70,000 psychological level, or higher to clear the $73,777 peak before a new all-time high.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price slumps further from Thursday's record high above $73K\n\nEthereum price suffers the wake of a weakening BTC\n\nEthereum price is nose-diving, taking direct cues from BTC despite the recent Dencun Upgrade, which was expected to be a bullish fundamental to positive impact ETH price. With technicals flashing bearish, Ethereum price could extend the fall to test the $3,527 support.\n\nIf the aforementioned level fails to hold as support, Ethereum price could slip past this buyer congestion level, potentially going as low as the $3,200 level, a 12% drop below the current price.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, a re-entry by the bulls could see Ethereum price recover. A flip of the formidable resistance due to the equal lows of $3,722 into support after a strong spike in bullish momentum would improve the chances of continuing the uptrend. This development could result in ETH heading straight to the $4,093 range high.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum L2 bridge deposits skyrocket after Dencun Upgrade\n\nRipple price eyes a 7% drop\n\nRipple price is down 15% after a peak of $0.7440 on March 11. Amid falling momentum and a downtrend that is gaining strength, XRP price could extend the fall 7% to $0.5740 before a possible recover.\n\nHowever, in a dire case where this level fails to hold, Ripple price could extend lower to the $0.5368 support level where the bulls could have another buying opportunity.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if bullish momentum increases, Ripple price could reverse the direction. A move above the $0.700 psychological level would inspire more buy orders, reinvigorating the trend for XRP price to clear the $0.7500 range high.\n\nIn a highly bullish case, Ripple price could reach the $0.8000 psychological level.

This marks a significant step towards the decentralization of rollups.\n\nThe decentralized Sequencer represents a significant advancement compared to the single sequencer model currently adopted by other Layer-2 rollup solutions.\n\nThis launch positions Metis as the first rollup of Ethereum to adopt a decentralized approach to its sequencer. Rollups represent one of the most promising scalability solutions, but currently they have some drawbacks.\n\nTo fully ensure the security of Ethereum, a decentralized fraud/validity proof system and a decentralized sequencer are needed.\n\nSo far, no other rollup has focused on the decentralization of the sequencer, making them vulnerable to single points of failure and potentially subject to censorship.\n\nWith this new feature, instead, by keeping control over a single sequencer, the foundations maintain almost total control over the network and its revenues.\n\nSecurity, fairness, and community involvement in the crypto network\n\nThe adoption of a decentralized sequencer by Metis allows multiple entities to manage the sequencers. This improves the security and decentralization of the network and enables a more equitable revenue sharing with users.\n\nA distributed sequencer also paves the way for crucial functions such as seamless and secure sequencer rotation, the ejection of malfunctioning or harmful entities, and increased network stability.\n\nUsers can contribute to maintaining the decentralization, transparency, and stability of the network by becoming sequencers and participating in the consensus process.\n\nThe participation of multiple entities makes it more difficult for malicious actors to control or compromise the order of transactions.\n\nThe Sequencer nodes can earn rewards in METIS tokens for their role in block production and transaction processing within the network.\n\nActive participation from the community can lead to greater recognition within the group, paving the way for future collaborations or potential partnerships.\n\nFurthermore, during the first year, all sequencer nodes will benefit from a Mining Rewards Rate (MRR) of 20%.\n\nMetis gets a price rally with listing on Binance\n\nMetis has experienced a significant increase of about 27-30% after the announcement of its inclusion on the Binance trading platform.\n\nThe inclusion on Binance of the crypto has effectively introduced the project to a wide range of traders and investors, increasing its liquidity and accessibility.\n\nThe surge in the token price can be attributed to various factors, including the increase in visibility and credibility resulting from being listed on Binance, as well as the growing market interest in Layer 2 scalability solutions like Metis.\n\nParticularly significant is the fact that Binance has waived the listing fee for Metis, demonstrating confidence in the potential of the project and commitment to promoting innovation in the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe designation of \u201cSeed Tag\u201d conferred to Metis by Binance highlights its status as an innovative project, which could involve greater volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens.\n\nThe increase in Metis prices and its listing on Binance have coincided with a broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has recently surpassed its previous all-time high, exceeding $71,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has temporarily exceeded $4,000, further contributing to the bullish sentiment around Metis and other promising blockchain projects."

        "content": "The crypto world is buzzing with anticipation as major developments unfold, promising to reshape the landscape of digital currency investments. At the heart of these changes are Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, Chiliz's innovative token burning mechanism and BlockDAG's ambitious $600M roadmap. Each of these entities brings something unique to the table, targeting investors looking for the next big crypto opportunity with a mix of technology enhancements and strategic initiatives.\n\nEthereum's Dencun Upgrade\n\nEthereum just launched its Dencun upgrade this week, a much anticipated event of 2024. This upgrade, the most substantial change to the Ethereum blockchain in over a year, introduces \"proto-danksharding\" via Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844. Aimed at reducing fees for layer-2 (L2) rollups, this move is expected to enhance Ethereum's scalability by improving data handling capabilities for auxiliary networks. L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon stand to benefit the most, potentially enjoying reduced operational costs and fostering a more efficient transaction process. This step towards sharding indicates Ethereum's commitment to solving high gas fees in the short term, potentially boosting its appeal to investors and users.\n\nChiliz's Strategic Move with Token Burning\n\nChiliz, the powerhouse behind fan tokens, has introduced a token burning mechanism to reignite interest in this niche. By burning tokens whenever a team scores or wins, Chiliz aims to reduce the overall token supply, thereby increasing scarcity and potentially boosting token value. This innovative approach not only adds excitement to the Champions League but also positions Chiliz as a forward-thinking player in the crypto space. The immediate response was positive, with the CHZ token witnessing a 2.47% rise in value following the announcement. This strategy could significantly enhance the attractiveness and utility of fan tokens, setting Chiliz apart in the competitive crypto market.\n\nBlockDAG's Keynote: An Ambitious Roadmap For 2024\n\nBlockDAG is setting the stage for monumental growth with its impressive keynote for the year 2024. Having raised over $4.8 million already and eyeing a $600 million milestone that could outpace all presale competitors, BlockDAG has sold out its Batch 2 and has jumpstarted in Batch 3 with a price of $0.002. With plans for top exchange listings on platforms like KuCoin and Gate.io, BlockDAG is not just aiming for visibility but also for accessibility to a broader audience. The promise of 50X returns for early investors highlights the project's confidence in its value proposition.\n\nGone are the days when miners needed high powered specialised equipment BlockDAG has introduced a user friendly app - BlockDAG X1 app, which is available in various platforms like AppStore and Google Play. For those naive to the crypto world about the prospects of mobile mining convenience, get enlightened with the fact that it allows users to mine up to 20 BDAG coins daily effortlessly from their smartphones. This innovative approach offers a passive income stream, further sweetened by the specialised mining units for enhanced profits. BlockDAG offers state of the art mining rigs that make mining easier with added processing power and extended operational life. Miners can trade their coins and resale at much established platforms like Amazon, Ebay and Shopify.\n\nWhy BlockDAG Stands Out\n\nIn a market teeming with opportunities, BlockDAG distinguishes itself through a blend of ambitious goals, strategic exchange listings, and user-friendly mining solutions. As Ethereum works to lower operational costs for its network and Chiliz explores new ways to engage and reward its community, BlockDAG's comprehensive approach addresses the investment and participation angles, making it a noteworthy contender for those looking to dive into crypto. With its Layer 1 Presale now live, BlockDAG invites investors to be part of a project poised for significant growth, promising not just returns but also an active role in the evolving crypto ecosystem.\n\nTo know more about BlockDAG:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

The $4.1k level was almost reached before the bulls were forced to retreat. Investors need not worry about this dent in prices too much.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] also faltered just above the $73k level and dragged the rest of the market down. While the rally is expected to continue higher in the long run, further losses are anticipated over the next few weeks.\n\nTraders need to be prepared for a fall below $3500\n\nThe 12-hour chart showed that the bullish bias remained intact based on the price action. Yet on the 4-hour timeframe and lower the structure has flipped bearishly. Even the 12-hour RSI fell below the neutral 50 mark to reflect bearish momentum was rising.\n\nThe recent pullback is not a flush of the overleveraged bulls as we saw on the 5th of March. The rally saw its momentum stutter after the 12th of this month, followed by an increase in selling pressure.\n\nThe OBV began to drop lower to support this idea. The Fibonacci retracement levels (pale yellow) highlighted that the 61.8%-78.6% region at $3100-$3315 would likely be retested as support. The $3463 level could also halt the bearish progress.\n\nLong-term investors need to brace for further losses\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s analysis of the liquidation levels heatmap showed that ETH would likely post more losses. The $3560 level was estimated to trigger $2.6 billion worth of liquidations.\n\nThese large liquidation levels were concentrated in the $3520-$3560 region, marking it as a support zone. Ethereum could see a bullish reaction from here.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nBelow the $3520 level, the next large liquidation levels sat at $3300 and $3130. The former was estimated to have $2.2 billion in liquidations, and the latter to have $5.4 billion.\n\nIt also had confluence with the 78.6% retracement level at $3102.\n\nDisclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion."

        "content": "Asset management firm Grayscale Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEthereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin\u2019s, Grayscale Argues\n\nAccording to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has revised its 19b-4 form for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was \u201cimportant\u201d in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.\n\nThe chief legal officer stated in his post that investors \u201cwant and deserve access\u201d to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. \u201cWe believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm said.\n\nThe asset manager is amongst the numerous firms looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock\u2019s filing on March 4, 2024.\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.\n\nSEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval\n\nTwo US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.\n\nAlexander Grieve @AlexanderGrieve The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. @SenatorJackReed and @Senlaphonza write to the @SECGov urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N\n\nFollowing the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval.\n\nA part of the letter read:\n\nRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.\n\nAs of this writing, the price of the Ethereum token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day."
