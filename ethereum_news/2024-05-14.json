        "content": "Washington \u2014 A pair of brothers from New York and Boston were taken into federal custody Tuesday, accused by prosecutors of devising a novel criminal scheme to steal about $25 million in cryptocurrency from a commonly used blockchain, according to a newly unsealed indictment.\n\nAnton and James Peraire-Bueno were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Investigators accused them of spending months plotting their theft within the Ethereum blockchain, baiting their victims and establishing shell companies to hide their illicit profits.\n\nAccording to charging documents, the pair studied math and computer science \"at one of the most prestigious universities in the country,\" which prosecutors said afforded them a unique set of skills that allowed them to carry out the first-of-its-kind endeavor in a matter of seconds. James Peraire-Bueno is listed as a 2021 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the MIT Registrar's Office confirmed that Anton Peraire-Bueno earned a B.S. in computer science and engineering in February 2024, and James Peraire-Bueno earned a B.S. in mathematics, computer science and aerospace engineering in June 2019, as well as a M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics in June 2021.\n\nThe brothers allegedly started laying the groundwork in December 2022, engaging in what investigators called a \"baiting\" operation that targeted three specific victim traders on the digital Ethereum platform. They are specifically accused of exploiting the \"validators\" on the blockchain, vital components of the integrity and security of transactions.\n\n\"In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims' cryptocurrency,\" prosecutors alleged in court documents.\n\nInvestigators said the defendants' plot took months to plan but just 12 seconds to execute, allegedly raking in approximately $25 million from their unwitting victims.\n\nFrom April and June of last year, Peraire-Buenos are accused of laundering their money through shell companies. Prosecutors said the duo even rejected repeated requests from a victim, the victim's attorney and an Ethereum representative to return the cryptocurrency.\n\nThey were arrested on Tuesday and are expected to make their initial appearances in New York and Boston federal courts on Wednesday.\n\n\"As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, the Justice Department will continue to root out fraud, support victims, and restore confidence to these markets,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys for the brothers could not be immediately identified."

        "title": "Two Reasons Why Ethereum ($ETH) Is Underperforming Bitcoin ($BTC) As an Asset - CryptoGlobe",
        "content": "The Ethereum blockchain has long faced issues with scalability, particularly during high activity periods that lead to network congestion, slow transaction times, and high gas fees. These challenges affect user experience and limit the network\u2019s capacity to support a diverse range of applications. The Dencun upgrade, introduced in March 2024, represents a significant advancement towards resolving these issues by laying the groundwork for future scalability improvements.\n\nDencun, which combines elements from the Cancun and Deneb upgrades, does not provide an immediate solution to all scalability problems. However, it is a crucial milestone in Ethereum\u2019s development. Central to the Dencun upgrade is the concept of \u201cproto-danksharding,\u201d which sets the stage for future sharding implementations. Sharding involves partitioning the blockchain into smaller shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This parallel processing is expected to substantially increase Ethereum\u2019s transaction throughput in the future. While Dencun does not implement sharding directly, it establishes the necessary technical foundation for its eventual deployment.\n\nThe primary focus of Dencun is not directly reducing transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet. Instead, it aims to optimize fees within Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions function on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aggregating transactions off-chain before submitting them back to the mainnet. This process helps mitigate congestion on the main network and can potentially lower fees for users.\n\nA significant feature of Dencun is EIP-4844, which lowers the cost for Layer 2 networks to submit their bundled transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. This improvement is expected to enhance the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions, potentially reducing fees for their users. However, the actual fee reductions observed may not be as substantial as initially projected, and the long-term effects on fees will need further monitoring.\n\nOne unintended consequence of the Dencun upgrade has been its impact on the Ethereum supply. The reduction in transaction fees led to a decrease in the amount of ETH burned. Previously, higher network activity and fees resulted in more ETH being burned, contributing to a deflationary effect on its total supply. Following the Ethereum Merge, which transitioned the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this deflationary mechanism was an anticipated benefit. However, with fewer fees being burned and the natural increase in supply, the total supply of ETH has started to grow at a faster rate, shifting back towards an inflationary model.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has prompted a fresh analysis from CryptoQuant, a respected South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm. This upgrade, according to CryptoQuant, may significantly alter Ethereum\u2019s progression towards becoming an \u201cultra sound money\u201d \u2013 a concept that denotes a currency that appreciates or maintains its value over time.\n\nSee our full analysis \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/6KYAcn0KQ8 \u2014 Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) May 13, 2024\n\nThe other problem for Ethereum is that once the U.S. SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, many people thought that probably within a few months, the SEC would start approving some, if not all, of the several pending spot Ethereum ETF proposals. Unfortunately, with the SEC\u2019s recent crackdown against the Ethereum ecosystem (e.g. Uniswap receiving a Wells notice last month), it seems that SEC Chair Gary Gensler sees Ether (ETH) as a security (which is what Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin suspects) and therefore the expectations for spot Ethereum ETFs getting approved in the U.S. sometime in 2024 have been dramatically lowered. Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do not see an approval until 2025.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that the U.S. SEC may reject Ethereum spot ETF on May 23, and approval may not be until the end of 2025. If Trump wins, the SEC will likely face a change in leadership that may be friendlier than Gary Gensler's.

        "content": "Homepage > News > Business > 2 arrested for $25 million exploit of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake validators\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nEthereum\u2019s already wobbly foundation looks even shakier following the arrest of two brothers who exploited the network\u2019s vulnerabilities to steal $25 million from transaction validators.\n\nOn May 15, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the arrest of two brothers\u2014Anton and James Peraire-Bueno\u2014on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted on all counts, the brothers face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe MIT-educated pair are accused of netting around $25 million worth of tokens in a 12-second span\u2014the duration of a block validation \u2018slot\u2019 on Ethereum\u2014by manipulating vulnerabilities in the process by which Ethereum verifies transactions. Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the \u201cnovel\u201d scheme \u201ccalls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\u201d\n\nThe scheme involved Ethereum\u2019s so-called \u2018maximal extractable value\u2019 (MEV), the process by which Ethereum\u2019s transaction validators can preview and reorder pending transactions. MEV allows validators to personally profit from this advance knowledge by front-running significant or large transactions. European regulators recently flagged MEV for its potential for market abuse.\n\nThe DOJ says the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole funds that would otherwise have gone to a group of Ethereum validators using MEV-Boost. This open-source software outsources the creation of new Ethereum blocks to a network of \u2018searchers,\u2019 \u2018builders,\u2019 and \u2018relays.\u2019\n\nSearchers utilize automated bots to scan the Ethereum mempool for profitable arbitrage opportunities, then forward a bundle of preferred transactions to the builder. This bundle prioritizes the searcher\u2019s \u2018frontrun\u2019 transaction, aka buying a token on the expectation that the transactions that follow will boost the value of said token. The searcher also includes a \u2018sell\u2019 transaction further back in the bundle to cash out this expected spike in token value.\n\nBuilders sent these bundles to a relay, which initially submits only the blockheader to a validator. Only after the validator accepts the block for publishing to the chain does the validator see the complete ordered transaction list.\n\nTaking the bait\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the brothers began plotting their heist around December 2022, just months after Ethereum made its transition from a consensus mechanism based around proof-of-work (PoW) to one based on proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nThe brothers established 16 validators, then engaged in a series of \u2018bait transactions\u2019 to figure out what motivated MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The brothers thus identified three \u2018victim traders\u2019 that specialized in crypto arbitrage trades.\n\nThe brothers then initiated \u201cat least eight\u201d transactions (the \u2018Lure transactions\u2019) they knew would cause the victim traders\u2019 MEV bots to propose bundles containing these transactions. The bundles also included the victim traders\u2019 own \u2018buy\u2019 transactions in which they paid $25 million in stablecoins and other tokens to acquire \u201csubstantial amounts of particularly illiquid cryptocurrencies\u201d (aka shitcoins of little or no utility).\n\nThe victim traders also included their \u2018sell\u2019 transactions after the Lure transactions, but with coded conditions that the frontrun transactions couldn\u2019t be executed unless the Lure transactions \u201ctook place immediately after the frontrun trades\u201d and the sell transactions occurred immediately after the Lure transactions.\n\nBut the brothers had identified a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay code that prematurely exposed the full content of proposed blocks. This allowed the brothers to tamper with the victim traders\u2019 proposed blocks when one of the brothers\u2019 16 validators was selected to approve the next block.\n\nOnce the victim traders\u2019 $25 million buy transactions had gone through, the brothers \u201creplaced the Lure transactions with Tampered transactions. In the Tampered transactions, the defendants sold the same illiquid cryptocurrencies that the victim traders had recently purchased as a result of the Lure transactions and, for which the defendants already held as a result of information gathered through the bait transactions. In effect, the Tampered Transactions drained the particular liquidity pools of all the cryptocurrency that the Victim Traders had deposited based on their frontrun trades.\u201d\n\nThe net result was that the victim traders\u2019 sell orders couldn\u2019t go through, leaving them with worthless shitcoins while the brothers collected around $25 million in stablecoins and more liquid tokens. The brothers then published the re-ordered block to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe victim traders eventually caught on to what had occurred and reached out to the brothers, as did \u201ca representative from Ethereum.\u201d The brothers ignored these pleas and set about laundering their stolen loot through exchanges with minimal \u2018know your customer\u2019 controls as well as some decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nWhile the brothers may have graduated from MIT, they failed OpSec 101 by googling phrases such as \u2018money laundering\u2019 and \u2018does the United States extradite to [insert country here]\u2019 ahead of their heist.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the brothers\u2019 high-tech antics \u201cwere no match for DOJ prosecutors and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents, who unraveled this first-of-its-kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme.\u201d IRS Criminal Investigation unit special agent Thomas Fattorusso added that his office had \u201csimply followed the money\u201d using \u201ccutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d\n\nWhile the company behind MEV-Boost released an update to prevent future exploits of this kind, the reputational hit that Ethereum has taken since its shift to PoS shows no sign of ending. In fact, PoS is considered one of the primary reasons why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is (allegedly) preparing to designate ETH as an unregistered security.\n\nA significant chunk of ETH was already concentrated in relatively few hands, most of them belonging to Ethereum insiders who were the primary beneficiaries of 2014\u2019s controversial crowdsale. PoS was guaranteed to further concentrate control of the network, trigging more planks of the Howey test. Regulatory blowback was/is inevitable.\n\n\u2018Compromised and partially drained\u2019\n\nStill more \u2018crypto\u2019 bro-on-bro violence made the news this week courtesy of a hack of the BlockTower blockchain-focused institutional investment firm.\n\nOn May 14, Bloomberg reported that BlockTower\u2019s main hedge fund had been \u201ccompromised and partially drained by fraudsters,\u201d citing sources familiar with the situation who didn\u2019t want to be identified. The total amount of the stolen assets, as well as the nature of the hack went unspecified, but BlockTower has reportedly hired blockchain forensics experts to get to the bottom of this mess.\n\nAs a private company beholden only to its well-heeled investors, BlockTower has so far offered no official statement about the report. The company\u2019s main fund held around $1.7 billion worth of assets under management prior to the hack.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlockTower has suffered losses via exploits, having lost $1.5 million worth of TRU tokens after hackers targeted its wallet on the Dexibel decentralized exchange in 2023.\n\nBlockTower describes its Flagship fund\u2019s M.O. as \u201cfocused on liquid crypto assets via a multi-strategy approach analyzing both top-down market regimes and bottom-up asset selection (beta augmented with alpha), and incorporating market neutral strategies where appropriate to the opportunity set.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, BlockTower launched a dedicated venture capital fund that has taken stakes in numerous \u2018crypto\u2019 entities, including memecoin-factory Solana, struggling NFT-focused Dapper Labs, Sky Mavis (parent of the Axie Infinity game, which suffered a nine-figure hack of its Ronin Bridge network in 2022) and fraudulent \u2018algorithmic stablecoin\u2019 issuer Terraform Labs.\n\nHonestly, given that stellar track record, we\u2019re a little surprised there was anything left to steal.\n\nMake it stop\n\nBlockTower wasn\u2019t the end of this week\u2019s hackery. The Sonne Finance \u2018decentralized non-custodial lending protocol\u2019 was taken for $20 million worth of \u2018wrapped\u2019 ETH and USDC tokens. Sonne Finance said it\u2019s prepared to offer the hacker a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 that would allow him/her/they to keep 10% of their loot as payment for pointing out the gaping security flaws if they return the other 90%.\n\nBut the hacker has reportedly already swapped some of their ill-gotten gains for nearly 1,200 ETH and 183,000 DAI (an Ethereum-based stablecoin maintained by the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization). From there, the ETH will almost certainly tread the well-trodden path to Tornado Cash, the ETH-based coin mixer that helps obfuscate a digital asset\u2019s digital trail.\n\nWe say that with some confidence because on May 14, Reuters revealed a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions committee report that found Tornado Cash helped launder $147.5 million worth of ETH that was stolen from Justin Sun\u2019s HTX (formerly Huobi) exchange last year by North Korea\u2019s hackers.\n\nThat nine-figure sum was funneled through Tornado Cash in the month of March alone. A further $66.3 million worth of ETH that was stolen from the Sun-linked Poloniex exchange has been similarly washed. With apologies to ancient Rome, when it comes to stolen tokens, all roads lead to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe UN report, based on data provided by PeckShield and Elliptic analysts, also found that North Korea was the likely culprit behind 97 suspected attacks on \u2018crypto\u2019 firms that netted the Hermit Kingdom some $3.6 billion between 2017 and 2024. The same report indicates that North Korea may have been responsible for 11 \u2018crypto\u2019 heists so far this year that netted nearly $55 million.\n\nIronically, many of the victims of these heists were likely among the legions of \u2018crypto bros\u2019 loudly denouncing this week\u2019s sentencing of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in a Dutch prison for money laundering. Code is law, after all\u2026 that is, until it\u2019s your bits of code that have been stolen and laundered. Still, man up and take one for the team, right?\n\nOne imagines that, within crypto crook circles, it\u2019s hard to get angry when they get caught thieving from each other. After all, it\u2019s the dominant ethos of this game, in which the much-ballyhooed notion of \u2018building\u2019 doesn\u2019t so much take a backseat to \u2018grifting,\u2019 it gets relegated to a rickety trailer haphazardly hitched to the back of this out-of-control 18-wheeler.\n\nFor those of you who crave a more productive, utilitarian and (ta-da!) legally- and regulatory-compliant worldview, there\u2019s a little shindig going on in London next week that might be just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nWatch: Teranode & the Web3 world with edge-to-edge electronic value system"

They have also applied for a spot in ethereum ETF, which is currently under review by the SEC.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true .\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today?\n\nThough they did not make a formal comment, ARK and 21Shares updated their filing for the spot ethereum ETF application. The update removed a small clause related to staking. Originally, the firms were looking to stake ETH that was held by the firms, which would have been labeled as income from the fund. \"Sponsor may, from time to time, stake a portion of the Trust's assets through one or more trusted Staking Providers,\" the clause noted.\n\nHowever, the update excluded this clause. While they did keep all of the other clauses specific to ethereum, the change caused some to raise eyebrows. Eric Balchunas is an ETF analyst for Bloomberg and in a post on X, he said, \"While it may seem like this is them getting their docs in shape based on SEC comments (which would be good news) there hasn't been any comments. So it\u2019s prob either a Hail Mary or maybe trying to give SEC one less thing to use in their rejection. Not sure (yet).\"\n\nAccording to Balchunas, the SEC did not prompt ARK and 21Shares to make the change. So, in his opinion, it is some sort of preemptive action to give their application a higher probability of acceptance.\n\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?\n\nThe issue of staking has been seen by some as a hang-up for potential approval of spot ethereum ETFs. The novelty of the system could cause further delays in the already lengthy decision-making process by the SEC. So, by leaving it out of the application, ARK could improve its chances of approval. However, this does come at the cost of having a less attractive ETF, as the staking rewards would not be earned.\n\nThe SEC has already made delays to decisions on multiple applications. As it stands, the final date for a decision on the VanEck ETH ETF application is May 23, followed by ARK 21Shares' on May 24th.\n\n\"Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none,\" Balchunas said in a post on X.\n\nCathie Wood is the CEO of ARK Invest and is known to be extremely bullish on cryptocurrency. However, even she acknowledged that the crypto ETF market may not see much more growth. \"We'd be surprised to see anything but bitcoin and ether being approved by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission],\" she said in an interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for a spot ethereum ETF is getting weaker, and the SEC has not spoken often on the topic. While there is certainly a possibility that the ETFs could receive approval in late 2024 or 2025, it seems unlikely that they will occur anytime soon.\n\nRead Next:\n\ncrypto digital assets\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article ARK 21Shares Amends Spot ETH ETF Filing: Cathie Wood On Ethereum ETF Approvals originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may soon assert that Ethereum is a security in its expected rejections of several spot Ethereum ETF applications, a lawyer who specializes in digital assets warned Tuesday.\n\nThe regulator is due to decide on VanEck\u2019s application for such a product on May 23, followed by a final decision deadline for ARK Invest/21Shares\u2019 application the next day. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale also have applications on the SEC\u2019s desk.\n\nIn March, the SEC put forth potential \u201cgrounds for [the] disapproval\u201d of BlackRock\u2019s application and Nasdaq\u2019s proposal to list BlackRock\u2019s product. One question the SEC posed in its notice is whether Nasdaq \u201cproperly filed its proposal\u201d under the exchange\u2019s rules for so-called Commodity-Based Trust Shares.\n\nRequiring that trusts hold a \u201cspecified commodity,\u201d Scott Johnson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, described the question\u2019s inclusion as telling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nRather than indirectly excluding the digital asset as a commodity, the SEC could explicitly assert that Ethereum is a regulated security in its expected ETF denials. But that\u2019s \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d Terrence Yang, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cGensler and his team, they\u2019re political animals,\u201d he said, arguing that the political backdrop surrounding crypto has grown too tense for a move that would likely spark backlash from crypto-friendly politicians, including Former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, hopes that spot Ethereum ETFs will get the same treatment have plummeted. On the blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, traders penciled in a pessimistic 16% chance that ETFs are approved this month, as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven though SEC Chair Gary Gensler has publicly affirmed that Bitcoin is a commodity, the Wall-Street cop has been tight-lipped when it comes to Ethereum, refusing to answer questions about the cryptocurrency\u2019s regulatory status as recently as March.\n\nLast month, a lawsuit filed by the Ethereum software company Consensys alleged that the SEC has internally viewed Ethereum as a security for over a year. Among other requests, the firm asked a federal judge in Texas to declare Ethereum is a commodity.\n\nPrior to its approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, the SEC denied similar applications for a decade, citing concerns of fraud and market manipulation in Bitcoin\u2019s spot market. So-called surveillance agreements monitoring the Bitcoin futures market for ETFs that were already approved wouldn\u2019t be sufficient, the SEC said.\n\nEventually, a federal appellate court found that logic faulty, ordering the SEC to vacate its previous rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its flagship trust into an ETF. Given the SEC approved Ethereum futures ETFs last October, Yang said a similar headache for the regulator could follow if it points to market manipulation again.\n\n\u201cThey can do it, but they should expect to get sued, and I think they'll get attacked politically through the heavy lobbying that the well-funded crypto industry has,\u201d he said.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024 2025 2026 - AlexaBlockchain",
        "content": "As the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has attracted the attention of investors and industry experts. With advancements in blockchain technology and the increasing popularity of decentralized applications (dApps), the future of Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a subject of widespread debate.\n\nIn 2021, the price of Ethereum hit an all-time high of $4,600, fuelled by the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Yet, what causes the price of Ethereum to continue to fluctuate wildly? Could Ethereum one day witness a value overflow of this cryptocurrency at a higher growth rate?\n\nIn this article, we bring you a detailed review regarding the factors that could influence the economic predictions of ETH in the coming years. We will also give you the anticipated costs in 2024, 2025, and 2026.\n\nEthereum Overview\n\nEthereum is an innovative cryptocurrency that takes the shape of a decentralized, open-source blockchain. It first emerged in 2015 and came alive via people looking for a network that encourages smart contracts and decentralized apps to be developed and used without manipulating, hacking, or being influenced by fraud.\n\nThis platform further aids creators in planning goods and performing contracts quickly without any negative consequences. Indeed, compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has a wider scope that includes cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. For this type of machines like those that are required to reach a new level of these apps, the \u2018Ethereum Virtual Machine\u2018 (EVM) lies in the epicenter of Ethereum.\n\nHistorical Price Analysis\n\nEver since 2015, prices of Ethereum have seen quite some lows and some highs at the same time; thus, it\u2019s been quite a volatile ride for the fintech asset. Ethereum prices had been determined and influenced by a lot of things such as the overall market sentiment, advances in technology and how well they were adopted within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nA particular craze worth mentioning about 2017 was the ICO, and the buying using ETH alone brought about a surge in the demand for ETH. About $8 was its initial price at the beginning of 2017, and its price has reached an all-time high of over $1300 before 2018 ended. From there, a bear market showed continuous decline of ETH prices through months. ETH\u2019s price had leveled at around $130 at the end of the year.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic catalyzed the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and a lot of mainstream interest and recognition which it didn\u2019t have before. The rise of decentralized finance of the DEFI was primarily seen as very bullish for the evolution of the Ethereum Network, and subsequently, the price of ETH lifted from then. Each ETH was priced at $4600 at the end of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022.\n\nBy the end of 2022, Ethereum saw another dip which continued through all of 2023 with the fintech asset priced as low as 1100$. The market came back by the end of 2023 at a ranging price of around $4000. And in May 2024, the price of Ethereum is currently around $3080.\n\nEthereum Price Predictions for 2024, 2025, and 2026\n\nPrice Prediction 2024\n\nAs the Ethereum network grows and expands, the demand for its native cryptocurrency will also grow in 2024. More sharding and scaling solutions will strengthen the network\u2019s capacities and speed and draw more users into the system. Henceforth, the bull run is likely and the currency will hit the $3,500 \u2013 $4,000 mark, by mid-2024.\n\nBy the end of 2024, ETH\u2019s integration into traditional finance and major corporation adoption could cause the predictions to increase to $4,000 \u2013 $5,000 if foreign exchange and other layer-2 scaling solutions tonight volumes.\n\nPrice Prediction 2025\n\nBy 2025, the Ethereum ecosystem might further mature and absorb into various fields. By solving all the scaling issues (if there are any) and introducing new layer-2 solutions, it will become far more efficient and will attract even more users and developers. So, the price might rise in the years to come.\n\nSlowly, when more real-world uses are implemented, and Ethereum-based app usage increases, the use could potentially even make the demand rise up. Since it can be noted from many experts that big investors and traditional finance sectors have also increased their interest in Ethereum. It might also make a profit to much extent as it is considered that Ethereum will become a dominant blockchain platform.\n\nIf this continues, the price predicted might reach within the range of $6000-$7000 by the end of the year 2025. The cryptocurrency market is notorious and high volatility is one of the aspects preventing it since unexpected events happen in the market frequently, which might increase or decrease the prices. Any legislative shift can also increase or decrease the prices of any cryptocurrency.\n\nPrice Prediction 2026\n\nIn 2026, Ethereum may prove to be unbeatable and may have shown much progress. The powerful Ethereum ecosystem and scaling solutions may probably absorb almost all industries. By not having any stress to adapt and evolve as it is upgraded or updated regularly, it can potentially cause several organizations or even governments to adopt blockchain technology.\n\nThe price for Ethereum (according to experts\u2019 speculation) might reach a range of $8000-$10000 by the end of 2026 if significant developments occur.\n\nForecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024-2026\n\nYear Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH) 2024 $3,500 \u2013 $5,000 2025 $6,000 \u2013 $7,000 2026 $8,000 \u2013 $10,000 Forecasted Price Range for Ethereum (ETH)\n\nInvestment Strategies\n\nEthereum is no different than any other investments and it is important to do thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. Here are some effective tips for people looking to invest in Ethereum:\n\nTechnical Analysis: Some of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on. These pinpoint the price areas where one should sell and buy.\n\nSome of the technical indicators are moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), chart patterns and so on.

        "title": "Ethereum Scaling With L2s Has Damaged Its Tokenomics. Is It Possible to Fix It? - Unchained",
        "content": "While Ethereum layer 2s are at an all-time high in terms of active addresses and transactions, the mainnet may not be doing as well.\n\nEthereum, often celebrated for being \u201cultrasound money\u201d owing to its deflationary bent, has turned inflationary again over the past month, challenging the foundational principles that its community thought drove its value. A recent report from CryptoQuant has declared the ultrasound money narrative dead, sparking debates and concerns about the tokenomics of ETH.\n\nLearn more: What Is Tokenomics? A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the balance between Ethereum\u2019s main chain and its Layer 2 scaling solutions (L2s). While L2s have successfully improved Ethereum\u2019s scalability by handling transactions off the main chain, they have inadvertently reduced the demand for Ethereum\u2019s native token, ETH, on the main chain. This reduction in demand has led to lower transaction fees, measured in gwei, and subsequently, less burning of ETH. Currently, gwei sits at around 8, significantly lower than in previous times, indicating that at this level, ETH is far from being deflationary.\n\nRead more: Why Ethereum Gas Fees Have Fallen to Their Lowest Level Since 2020\n\nEthereum can shift from deflationary to inflationary due to changes in network activity and the balance of Ether burned versus issued. Under EIP-1559, when transaction volumes are low and the burned base fees are less than the Ether issued in block rewards, the total supply of Ether increases, making Ethereum inflationary. This dynamic demonstrates how Ethereum\u2019s supply is not fixed but responsive to network usage, potentially impacting its value and scarcity when shifts from a deflationary to an inflationary state occur.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum L2s are ripping, processing 10 times more transactions than the main chain, while reaching an all-time high in weekly active addresses.\n\nGiven these levels of gas fees, the question arises: how much activity needs to happen in the L2s for ETH to become deflationary again?\n\nRead more: Horizontal Scalability Is the Solution to L2 Fragmentation\n\nA Complex System\n\nAnsgar Dietrichs, a researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, told Unchained that the deflationary mechanism of ETH is directly tied to its market cap and the balance between revenue and expenses. At low prices, the burning mechanism can exceed the issuance, making ETH deflationary. However, as the market cap grows and if revenues don\u2019t keep up proportionally, ETH can become inflationary.\n\nThis bidirectional influence means that the market cap not only affects the deflationary or inflationary nature of ETH, but also that this nature, in turn, affects the market cap through investor perceptions and behaviors.\n\nTo reverse this trend and restore the deflationary status of ETH, a significant increase in activity on L2s is required. This means that more transactions and fees need to be funneled back to the Ethereum main chain to increase the burning of ETH. However, according to Dietrichs, research has not been done to assess exactly how much activity it would take. Neither the Ethereum Foundation nor researcher Justin Drake responded to several emails requesting additional information on how much L2 activity is needed to keep ETH supply deflationary.\n\nIn addition, Dietrichs pointed out that for any given revenue and issuance level, with constant investor preferences, there is essentially one specific equilibrium market cap that the market would trend towards. Any change in these factors\u2014revenue, issuance, or investor preferences\u2014shifts this equilibrium market cap point. This dynamic feedback loop suggests that addressing the deflationary challenge is not just about tweaking a few parameters, but about understanding and influencing a complex system of interrelated factors.\n\nAs Ethereum continues to evolve, the question remains: Can the foundational promise of ultrasound money be restored, or will Ethereum have to adapt to a new economic reality?\n\nLearn more: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Ethereum Layers: Data Availability, Consensus, and Execution"

        "title": "MIT students stole $25M in seconds by exploiting ETH blockchain bug, DOJ says - Ars Technica",
        "content": "Within approximately 12 seconds, two highly educated brothers allegedly stole $25 million by tampering with the ethereum blockchain in a never-before-seen cryptocurrency scheme, according to an indictment that the US Department of Justice unsealed Wednesday.\n\nIn a DOJ press release, US Attorney Damian Williams said the scheme was so sophisticated that it \"calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question.\"\n\n\"The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of ethereum users across the globe,\" Williams said. \"And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete.\"\n\nAnton, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, were arrested Tuesday, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each brother faces \"a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count,\" the DOJ said.\n\nThe alleged scheme was launched in December 2022 by the brothers, who studied at MIT, after months of planning, the indictment said. The pair seemingly relied on their \"specialized skills\" and expertise in crypto trading to fraudulently gain access to \"pending private transactions\" on the blockchain, then \"used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims\u2019 cryptocurrency,\" the DOJ said.\n\nThe indictment goes into detail explaining that the scheme allegedly worked by exploiting the ethereum blockchain in the moments after a transaction was conducted but before the transaction was added to the blockchain.\n\nThese pending transactions, the DOJ explained, must be structured into a proposed block and then validated by a validator before it can be added to the blockchain, which acts as a decentralized ledger keeping track of crypto holdings. It appeared that the brothers tampered with this process by \"establishing a series of ethereum validators\" through shell companies and foreign exchanges that concealed their identities and masked their efforts to manipulate the blocks and seize ethereum.\n\nTo do this, they allegedly deployed \"bait transactions\" designed to catch the attention of specialized bots often used to help buyers and sellers find lucrative prospects in the ethereum network. When bots snatched up the bait, their validators seemingly exploited a vulnerability in the process commonly used to structure blocks to alter the transaction by reordering the block to their advantage before adding the block to the blockchain.\n\nWhen victims detected the theft, they tried to request the funds be returned, but the DOJ alleged that the brothers rejected those requests and hid the money instead.\n\nThe brothers' online search history showed that they studied up and \"took numerous steps to hide their ill-gotten gains,\" the DOJ alleged. These steps included \"setting up shell companies and using multiple private cryptocurrency addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges\" that specifically did not rely on detailed \"know your customer\" (KYC) procedures.\n\nThey also researched the \"very crimes charged in the indictment,\" the DOJ said. Among search terms found in the brothers' history during the planning phase of the alleged scheme were phrases like \"how to wash crypto\" and \"exchanges with no KYC.\" Later, seemingly attempting to prepare for any legal consequences from the scheme, the brothers allegedly searched for things like \"top crypto lawyers,\" and \"money laundering statute of limitations,\" and \"does the United States extradite to [foreign country].\"\n\nTo uncover the scheme, the special agent in charge, Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office, said that investigators \"simply followed the money.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the complexity of the case, we continue to lead the effort in financial criminal investigations with cutting-edge technology and good-ol'-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain,\u201d Fattorusso said.\n\nThe indictment comes the same month that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to decide whether to approve an ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to CNBC, the alleged fraud could fuel SEC skepticism as it reviews the ethereum ETF.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, a noted crypto skeptic, wants to ensure investors are protected before approving any potentially dangerous listings, CNBC noted."

        "title": "Why A Drop In The Price Of Ethereum Will Be Bullish Long Term - Investing Haven",
        "content": "There is a lot of fear for a decline in the Ethereum price. While the expectation of a drop is justified, confirmed by our latest Ethereum outlook research, it would not be a bad thing. Here is why an Ethereum price drop could be very bullish, long term that is.\n\nRelated \u2013 Can Ethereum Hit $100,000? An In-depth Analysis.\n\nThe way to think of financial markets, Ethereum being no exception, is in terms of structures. Particularly, chart structures with areas defined by support and resistance is the most simplified way to approach financial market analysis.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2024 support and resistance\n\nWe highly recommend not getting lost in the wild wild west of social media. Check this, it\u2019s pure noise.\n\nEveryone has an opinion nowadays. Those who are able to collect lots of likes seem to be the smartest in the room. Very often it\u2019s the exact opposite.\n\nIn order to understand the investment opportunity for Ethereum, we do the simplest possible thing, i.e. zoom out and remove all annotations.\n\nBelow is the weekly chart, no trendlines nor annotations.\n\nWhat do you see? How does it compare to the pattern in 2019?\n\nThere is tons of resistance even if ETH would rise to $4400. There is amazing support right above $1750, arguably in the $2200 area.\n\nIn case ETH drops in the coming months, it could be setting a gigantic cup and handle pattern. That\u2019s not bullish, that\u2019s a very bullish pattern!\n\nFrom our ETH predictions page:\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s Ethereum price forecast for 2024 is based on the bullish cup and handle chart formation. ETH should drop to its 50% Fibonacci level $2,250 in order to be bullish. A drop to $2,250 should offer an epic buy opportunity in 2024.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 2025 chart pattern\n\nAs explained above, the $2250 area is a key Fibonacci level.\n\nNow, what follows may be counterintuitive to most, but it\u2019s a reality \u2013 a drop may not feel good, but a drop to specific levels may be very good!\n\nProvided Ethereum respects $2250, on an 8 to 13 day closing basis, it will come with a very bullish outcome in 2025.\n\nA bullish cup and handle formation, which is what we forecast will be the outcome in case of an Ethereum price drop, has the intention to move much higher than resistance. For ETH, we expect a breakout to ATH, with targets well above former highs.\n\nFrom our Ethereum predictions page:\n\nInvestingHaven\u2019s top analyst has a very bullish ETH forecast 2025. If the area $2,050 to $2,300 holds strong on a 3-week closing basis, ETH will resolve higher in 2025. The current long term bullish chart pattern has bullish targets in the $5,000 to $9,000 area provided support is respected.\n\nInvalidation considerations\n\nNow, there is always the possibility of an invalidation. In the case of ETH, what if it continues to rise to $5000 in 2024?\n\nWe don\u2019t see this happening, there is not enough momentum in markets.\n\nMoreover, a rise to $5000 would qualify as a breakout, so the targets in that scenario would be much higher.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to rise to $5000, it\u2019s another thing to continue to rise well above $5000.\n\nA rise to $5000 will be confusing for investors and traders alike \u2013 which decision do you take at $5000 in 2024?\n\nHowever, with a cup and handle formation, a rise to $5000 (which we anticipate will occur in 2025) will be very bullish. The take-away: it will continue to rise well above $5000.\n\nWhen does our bullish cup and handle forecast invalidate? If ETH will have risen well above $5000 by Sept of 2024. Unlikely to happen, also not good, long term, if it would happen.\n\n10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OFFER: Go to our anniversary deals >> InvestingHaven.com celebrates 10 years.

One of the key proposals, EIP 7251, can provide a better UX for validators to earn staking yield. This proposal will increase the max effective balance of validators from 32 to 2048. Leading staking service providers, like Coinbase, are managing more than 130,000 validators already. The lift in maximum effective balance allows these providers to consolidate the number of validators and ultimately increase efficiency and lower the cost of operation."

        "content": "Odds of Ethereum Spot ETF Approval Are \u201cSlim to None,\u201d Says Bloomberg Analyst\n\nThe crypto world anxiously awaits the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) pivotal ruling on the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, scheduled for May 31st. As the deadline draws near, several factors have come into play, casting uncertainty over the decision's outcome.\n\nAt the center of the SEC's deliberations is a crucial question: whether Ethereum should be classified as a security or a commodity. This determination could significantly impact the fate of the spot ETF applications filed by various firms, including VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, BlackRock, and Fidelity.\n\nIn a recent development, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson highlighted a concerning detail from a March filing by BlackRock regarding its spot Ether ETF application. The filing called for public feedback on whether the investment vehicle could be listed as a commodity, suggesting that the SEC might be exploring the possibility of labeling Ether (ETH) as a security.\n\n\"The obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security,\" Johnsson stated in an X post.\n\nMixed Expectations and Market Reactions\n\nBloomberg's senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, has expressed skepticism regarding the likelihood of approval, reflecting the general sentiment that the regulator might maintain a cautious stance toward cryptocurrency-related products."

        "content": "Expectations for an Ethereum spot ETF has gotten significantly low in the community.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market performance continues to lag behind the majority of its peers.\n\nGary Gensler\u2019s SEC is known for playing power games with the cryptocurrency industry, like taking their time to approve any kind of application for crypto products.\n\nThey eased up a bit this year with the approval of eleven spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs.\n\nEthereum Spot ETF, when?\n\nNow, all eyes have turned to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate sibling, Ethereum [ETH]. Applications have been filed quite some time ago for what the community sees as Gensler\u2019s only preferred crypto to have its own spot ETF.\n\nNone has been approved, and the SEC has been noticeably quiet about it all. Just a few days ago, Grayscale withdrew their application for the ETH ETF., and didn\u2019t reveal their reasons for it either.\n\nThe lack of engagement from the SEC with applications from ETF issuers plus Grayscale\u2019s withdrawal have fueled speculation in the community that approval is not on the horizon.\n\nThis sentiment is mirrored in the market, with outflows totaling $14 million last week, according to data by CoinShares.\n\nFurthermore, ARK Invest and 21Shares have revised their proposal for a spot Ethereum ETF, removing plans to engage in staking.\n\nIn the latest filing, submitted on Friday, the previous clause that allowed 21Shares to stake a portion of the fund\u2019s assets through third-party providers was omitted.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas mentioned that this update could be an attempt to refine the application based on possible feedback from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/\n\nHowever, there have been no official statements.\n\nBalchunas also proposed that this amendment might be a strategy to minimize the details the SEC could use to potentially deny the application.\n\nEthereum\u2019s market movements\n\nTurning our attention to Ethereum\u2019s market, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world is not having a good time at the moment.\n\nThough all the other cryptos in the top ten have seen modest rises in the past twenty-four hours, Ether hardly budged. At press time, it is still way below its critical support level of $3,000.\n\nData from Santiment reveals that there is a lot of bearishness among Ethereum traders.\n\nTrading volumes have gone down, liquidations are low, but not because investors are staying put, but likely because they\u2019re bored.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum hasn\u2019t made any kind of major price movements this year. And the bulls are now unimpressed.\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at the ETH/USDt pair on TradingView and discovered extreme volatility with multiple ups and downs.\n\nThe highest peak approaches the $3,340 level, indicating strong buying interest, while the lowest nears $2,840, where selling pressure intensifies.\n\nThe price repeatedly tested support around $2,900 this past month, as indicated by multiple touches on this line but without actually breaking it, showing resilience at this level.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nRecently, the price shows a slight upward movement around $2,968, suggesting a tentative recovery or consolidation phase. But still, it failed. Ethereum was worth $2,958 at press time.\n\nGiven this context, the short-term prediction for Ethereum would lean towards a continuation of bearish trends."

        "content": "The famous crypto analyst Javon Marks has just made a very optimistic forecast for Ethereum (ETH), which has excited investors and traders. In his last post on X, Marks pointed out several bullish indicators that signal Ethereum might be about to experience a huge price jump.\n\nBased on Marks\u2019 analysis, the current price structure of ETH is like a bull flag, a technical pattern that usually indicates a further upward trend. He stressed that the higher formation of the ETH\u2019s price action indicated the continued buying interest and strength of the buyers. This pattern is reinforced by a hidden bullish divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) where lower lows in the RSI are opposed to the higher lows in the price action.\n\nMarks stressed that this diversion is a major signal of the possible upward trend. Lower lows in RSI and higher lows in price action make a hidden bullish divergence which reveals the underlying strength in ETH\u2019s current trend.\n\nEthereum Eyes $4,811: Major Breakout Ahead?\n\nThe analyst also mentioned that a greater price breakout was on the way. He estimated an upside potential of over 63%, which could take ETH to a price of $4,811. This projection is drawn from the technical analysis and the past performance of similar patterns.\n\nSource: Chart by Javon Marks\n\nA successful bull flag breakout could be the cause of Ethereum reaching its new all-time highs, thus, affecting the whole altcoin market significantly. He thinks that if this happens, it would not only be a turning point for Ethereum but also a driving force for the advancement of other altcoins that usually follow the movements of Ethereum.\n\nInvestors and traders are watching the price action of Ethereum closely, hoping to get a signal of the bull flag breakout. If Marks\u2019 estimations are right, the crypto market could have a major rise, and Ethereum would be the one to lead the way. The possibility of new all-time highs is a great chance for those, who are in a good position in the market, to make a profit.\n\nJavon Marks\u2019 latest analysis shows that Ethereum has a bright future, as the technical indicators are in accordance with the trend. The market is waiting for ETH\u2019s breakout, which could be the key to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s future.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "By Eurasia Review\n\nAn indictment was unsealed Wednesday charging Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, of Boston, and James Pepaire-Bueno, 28, of New York, with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges in the indictment arise from an alleged novel scheme by the defendants to exploit the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency within approximately 12 seconds.\n\nAnton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno were arrested Tuesday in Boston and New York, respectively, and will be presented Wednesday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul G. Levenson for the District of Massachusetts and U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\u201cAs alleged in today\u2019s indictment, the Peraire-Bueno brothers stole $25 million in Ethereum cryptocurrency through a technologically sophisticated, cutting-edge scheme they plotted for months and executed in seconds,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. \u201cUnfortunately for the defendants, their alleged crimes were no match for Department of Justice prosecutors and IRS agents, who unraveled this first-of-its kind wire fraud and money laundering scheme. As cryptocurrency markets continue to evolve, the Department will continue to root out fraud, support victims, and restore confidence to these markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, my office indicted two brothers \u2014 Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno \u2014 for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, all stemming from their alleged scheme to exploit the Ethereum blockchain and to obtain about $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from it,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. \u201cAs we allege, the defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question. The brothers, who studied computer science and math at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, allegedly used their specialized skills and education to tamper with and manipulate the protocols relied upon by millions of Ethereum users across the globe. And once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete. This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged. But as the indictment makes clear, no matter how sophisticated the fraud or how new the techniques used to accomplish it, the career prosecutors of this office will be relentless in pursuing people who attack the integrity of all financial systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese brothers allegedly committed a first-of-its-kind manipulation of the Ethereum blockchain by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions, altering the movement of the electronic currency, and ultimately stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency from their victims,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Thomas Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) New York Field Office. \u201cIn this case, IRS-CI New York\u2019s Cyber Unit simply followed the money. Regardless of the complexity of the case, we continue to lead the effort in financial criminal investigations with cutting-edge technology and good-ole-fashioned investigative work, on and off the blockchain.\u201d\n\nAs alleged in the indictment, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno are brothers who studied mathematics and computer science at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain in order to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million worth of cryptocurrency from victim cryptocurrency traders (the \u201cExploit\u201d). Through the Exploit, which is believed to be the very first of its kind, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain. In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter certain transactions and obtain their victims\u2019 cryptocurrency. Once the defendants stole their victims\u2019 cryptocurrency, they rejected requests to return the stolen cryptocurrency and took numerous steps to hide their ill-gotten gains.\n\nAnton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno meticulously planned the Exploit over the course of several months. Among other things, they learned the trading behaviors of the victim traders whose cryptocurrency they ultimately stole. As they planned the Exploit, they also took numerous steps to conceal their identities and lay the groundwork to conceal the stolen proceeds, including by setting up shell companies and using multiple private cryptocurrency addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges. After the Exploit, the defendants transferred the stolen cryptocurrency through a series of transactions designed to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds.\n\nThroughout the planning, execution, and aftermath of the Exploit, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno also searched online for information about, among other things, how to carry out the Exploit, ways to conceal their involvement in the Exploit, cryptocurrency exchanges with limited \u201cknow your customer\u201d procedures that they could use to launder their criminal proceeds, attorneys with expertise in cryptocurrency cases, extradition procedures, and the very crimes charged in the indictment.\n\nIf convicted, Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Pepaire-Bueno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count."

        "content": "Anton Peraire-Bueno and James Peraire-Bueno, two brothers who operate Ethereum validators, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe charges related to a scheme that has been described as exploiting the \u2018very integrity of the Ethereum Blockchain to fraudulently obtain approximately $25 million.\u2019\n\nThe brothers allegedly worked together on a complex exploit that allowed them to take advantage of traders searching for \u2018maximum extractable value\u2019 (MEV) on Ethereum.\n\nBy operating multiple Ethereum validators, the brothers were allegedly able to submit blocks that included exploited transactions.\n\nAllegedly, once the brothers were aware that their validators would soon have opportunities to submit blocks, they would create \u2018bait\u2019 transactions that seemed to have significant upside for the MEV traders and wait for those traders to attempt to \u2018sandwich\u2019 their trades.\n\nThese sandwich bots will often look for transactions with the potential for arbitrage and place transactions that buy shortly before and sell shortly after.\n\nWhen the traders were baited into submitting these \u2018bundles\u2019 of transactions, the brothers allegedly submitted a fake signature to MEV-Boost Relay, which at the time resulted in the relays prematurely releasing the whole proposed block.\n\nThey then allegedly took advantage of the fact that they were operating validators to disassemble the block and allow the traders to still front-run. However, instead of buying the asset the MEV trader believes they are interested in, they actually sold that asset at the higher price.\n\nA rogue validator on Flashbot seems to be exploiting MEV bots. Over 25m USD already stolen.\n\n\n\nThe validator takes a sandwich bundle from the MEV bot and replaces the victim transaction with it's own that exploits the MEV bot instead.\n\n\n\nHere's how it works \u2013 pic.twitter.com/il3o9r41J1 \u2014 Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) April 3, 2023\n\nRead more: How Flashbots is taking over Ethereum block proposals\n\nThis technique did potentially put their validators at risk of slashing, but the $25 million they were able to take outweighed the economic costs.\n\nThe indictment additionally details some of the steps the brothers allegedly took to plan for the exploit and to launder the funds once received. This allegedly included creating an \u2018exploit plan\u2019 that broke down the exploit into four steps:\n\nThe bait Unblinding the block The search The propagation\n\nAfter the exploit, the brothers turned to internet searches to manage the risk of their decisions, allegedly searching for:\n\n\u2018Top crypto lawyers\u2019\n\n\u2018How long is US statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Wire fraud statute/wire fraud statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Money laundering statute of limitations\u2019\n\n\u2018Computer fraud abuse act\u2019\n\n\u2018Does the United States extradite to\u2019\n\nIn order to help clean the funds they received from this exploit, the brothers allegedly transferred some to a \u2018second-layer exploit address,\u2019 which was subsequently frozen. Much of the remainder, totaling approximately $22 million, was converted to Dai, a stablecoin.\n\nAfter going through a lending protocol, this Dai was allegedly exchanged for Circle\u2019s stablecoin USDC. These funds were then allegedly transferred to an exchange account controlled by Pine Needle Inc., the company set up by the brothers, before being transferred again to a bank account associated with their business.\n\nThis indictment represents the first time that anybody has been indicted in the United States on fraud charges related to changing the expected ordering of transactions on Ethereum.\n\nGot a tip?

Authorities added that the two brothers had experience trading cryptocurrencies and allegedly set up shell companies and used multiple private crypto addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges to cover their tracks.\n\nEthereum is the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH. The network is used for everything from sending funds and minting and trading NFTs to building lending and borrowing apps.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, were steady hours heading into another U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer prices report.\n\nThe new Consumer Price Index report will be released at 8:30 a.m. EST. For now, things seem pretty tame in crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin price sitting just above $62,000\u2014up 0.6% compared to the same time yesterday. And the Ethereum price, which had sunk to around $2,900, was down 0.2% since Tuesday morning, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nEconomists have been forecasting that the market is in for another disappointingly high Consumer Price Index report today. The CPI is one of the key metrics that the Federal Reserve uses to determine whether it should lower the federal interest rate. But analysts have flagged that gas prices have been on the rise and prices have been inching upwards in the services sectors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's bad, but not necessarily terrible news, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThe trajectory is still down,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s been a more gradual downward move relative to the expectations coming into 2024.\u201d\n\nWhen the BLS issued its March Consumer Price Index report last month, it showed that personal expenditures in the U.S. had grown by 3.7%. The news that the U.S. economy had been growing slower than expected caused BTC and ETH to dip.\n\nBitcoin started the month having sunk below $60,000, briefly touched $65,000, and triggered the liquidation of hundreds of millions worth of derivatives positions along the way. More recently, the mix of macroeconomic factors\u2014including the war in Israel's War on Gaza and slowed growth in major economies like the U.S.\u2014has sparked pessimism in crypto markets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there's a little good news: Bitcoin billionaire Arthur Hayes said earlier this month that the bottom for BTC is already in.\n\n\"I expect prices to bottom, chop, and begin a slow grind higher,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. But he noted that he wasn't planning to add more Bitcoin to his bags.\n\n\"The recent intense puke out provides an excellent opportunity to unstake my USDe and spend synthetic dollars on high beta shitcoins,\" Hayes said. \"I\u2019m buying Solana and doggie coins for momentum trading positions.\""

        "content": "The Department of Justice on Wednesday announced the indictment of two brothers who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for allegedly stealing $25 million in cryptocurrency within roughly 12 seconds.\n\nThe DOJ said the brothers \u2014James Peraire-Bueno and Anton Peraire-Bueno \u2014 plotted the \"first-of-its-kind\" crypto fraud involving Ethereum blockchain over several months.\n\nTheir father is Jaime Peraire, the H.N. Slater Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and a former head of the university's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\n\"We are in shock, we don't even know what's going on,\" Jaime Peraire told CNBC when contacted at his home in Massachusetts, and asked about the arrest of James, 28, and 24-year-old Anton.\n\nPeraire declined to comment further.\n\nProsecutors said that Peraire-Bueno brothers allegedly identified a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain that allows outsourced bots to identify the most valuable pending crypto transactions before adding them to the blockchain, according to the indictment.\n\nThey then allegedly posed as the Ethereum validators that use those bots and redirected the pending transactions to steal the $25 million, the indictment said. Foreign law enforcers allegedly froze roughly $3 million of those funds, but the two men converted the unfrozen money to the DAI crypto token, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the DOJ said.\n\nThe Peraire-Buenos also allegedly set up shell companies and used multiple private cryptocurrency addresses and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges to hide their scheme.\n\n\"The defendants' scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, whose office is prosecuting the two men.\n\n\"Once they put their plan into action, their heist only took 12 seconds to complete,\" Williams said. \"This alleged scheme was novel and has never before been charged.\"\n\nJames, who lives in New York City, and Anton, who lives in Boston, were arrested Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nThey appeared separately in federal court in New York and Boston on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJudges set their bonds at $250,000 apiece, and each will be required to obtain two co-signers for their release bonds by May 29, according to a spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. They are also barred from trading cryptocurrency, securities and commodities.\n\nIf convicted, the brothers face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each of the three counts.\n\nWilliams's office said the Peraire-Bueno brothers studied math and computer science \"at one of the most prestigious universities in the country,\" and said that their education would have helped them to acquire the ability to carry out the alleged fraud.\n\nJames Peraire-Bueno earned a Bachelor of Science in mathematics with computer science, and in aerospace engineering in June 2019 from MIT, and then in June 2021 earned a Master of Science in aeronautics and astronautics from the school, according to an MIT spokeswoman.\n\nDuring his undergraduate years, he was a member of MIT's sailing team.\n\nAnton Peraire-Bueno earned a Bachelor of Science in computer science and engineering from MIT in February. He was a member of the university's rowing team.\n\nAnton's LinkedIn page says he was a cryptocurrency researcher intern at a San Francisco-based Polychain Capital for several months in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Anton co-authored an academic paper about a machine learning model that could have \"a strong practical impact\" for organizations \"with large amounts of sensitive data,\" according to a synopsis of that paper.\n\nLawyers for Anton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court docket did not show that any attorneys had filed appearances on behalf of James.\n\nThe charges come ahead of a long-awaited ruling expected from the Securities and Exchange Commission later this month on whether to approve an Ethereum exchange-traded fund.\n\nThat ETF would allow investors access to the ether token without having to directly own the cryptocurrency.\n\nIssuers of Bitcoin ETFs have already been bearish on the chances that the SEC will approve an ether ETF.\n\nThe DOJ's announcement of the alleged fraud could increase skepticism as the SEC completes that review.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has expressed concern about lacking regulation in crypto markets that could make it a dangerous listing for investors.\n\n\"To me, the fundamental question is, how do we ensure that the American investor is protected? And right now, they're not getting the required or needed disclosures,\" Gensler said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier this month.\n\n\"And the intermediaries in the center of this rather centralized market generally are conflicted and doing things we would never allow the New York Stock Exchange to do,\" he said."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is on the brink of a substantial recovery, as indicated by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez. The analyst\u2019s recent tweet has sent ripples across the digital asset sphere, highlighting a crucial technical indicator that suggests ETH's potential for a notable price upswing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRenowned for his keen observations within the crypto market, Martinez took to X to explain that the TD Sequential of ETH has revealed a buy signal on the daily chart. He noted that this crucial signal indicates the potential for the Ethereum price to experience a rebound spanning one to four candlesticks.\n\nThe TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Ethereum daily chart! It anticipates that $ETH could see a rebound of one to four candlesticks. pic.twitter.com/Vg7FTl9X2a \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2024\n\nThis observation comes at a pivotal moment for Ethereum, which has witnessed a tumultuous period characterized by fluctuating prices and market uncertainty. At the time of reporting, ETH\u2019s current price stands at $2,910, marking a marginal decline of 0.01% over the last 24 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, zooming out to a broader perspective reveals a more significant downtrend, with Ethereum plummeting by 10.80% over the past 30 days. This downward price trajectory of ETH has left investors and enthusiasts alike on edge, eagerly awaiting signs of a price reversal.\n\nHope for community\n\nMartinez's assertion provides a glimmer of hope for Ethereum proponents , suggesting that the cryptocurrency may be poised for a resurgence. The TD Sequential indicator, a technical analysis tool utilized to identify potential trend reversals, has historically proven to be a reliable metric within the crypto space.\n\nWith its recent alignment in favor of ETH, anticipation for a bullish reversal has intensified among traders and investors. Despite the recent bearish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, the prospect of a rebound underscores the resilience of the digital asset and its underlying blockchain network .\n\nIn the end, Ethereum's journey toward price recovery appears to be gaining traction, with signals of a potential rebound emanating from key technical indicators. As the crypto community braces for what lies ahead, the resilience and adaptability of Ethereum stand as testaments to its enduring relevance in the digital economy."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency: \u201cMass Institutional Adoption\u201d Underway, with Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum Value Surge - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "BlockDAG Network\n\nLondon, U.K., May 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency is a growing interest for the world's financial institutions and massive investment establishments. Digital finance is no longer just about testing the waters and gaining a broader presence on online portfolios, they are an everyday reality for the majority of the world\u2019s individuals and businesses.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, the digital asset class has evolved into a global phenomenon. What started as an experimental concept has now become a burgeoning industry, with a market capitalization surpassing trillions of dollars. The proliferation of cryptocurrencies has sparked a paradigm shift in the financial landscape, offering decentralized solutions and disrupting conventional models of banking and commerce.\n\nCryptocurrency and the Mass Institutional Adoption\n\nIn recent years, the industry has witnessed a significant uptick in institutional adoption, signaling a seismic shift in mainstream acceptance. Institutions, ranging from hedge funds to multinational corporations, are increasingly recognizing the potential of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles and store of value.\n\nThis mass institutional adoption is driven by several factors, including growing confidence in the technology, hedging against inflationary pressures, and diversification of investment portfolios. Moreover, regulatory clarity and enhanced infrastructure have bolstered both institutional and individual confidence, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and BlockDAG Network have seen a surge in value this year, driven by recent developments in the financial sector.\n\nIn a notable move, some of Wall Street's biggest banks are collaborating with Visa and Mastercard to experiment with tokenizing their assets. This initiative, predicted by Citi analysts to grow into a $5 trillion market by 2030, involves banks like JPMorgan, Citi, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, alongside Visa, Mastercard, and Swift. This could mean a significant step toward mass institutional adoption.\n\nTokenization of assets is considered the \"next generation for markets\" by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who has embraced Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the past year. BlackRock has quietly begun the second stage of its plan for a crypto-based \"revolution in financial markets\" by launching a tokenized private equity fund. Sovereign wealth funds are also showing interest in digital currencies, with potential trading activity expected in the coming months, according to BlackRock executives.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin: Leading the Way\n\n\n\nAt the forefront of this cryptocurrency revolution stands Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency that ignited the spark of decentralization. Since its inception over a decade ago, Bitcoin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, becoming synonymous with the concept of digital gold. With its finite supply, decentralized nature, and immutable ledger, Bitcoin has emerged as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nIn March 2024 Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high, reaching around $73,000 per BTC, boosting the combined market capitalization of cryptocurrencies to approximately $2.5 trillion. Analysts speculate that former U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve could trigger a massive price boom for Bitcoin.\n\nBlockDAG Network: A Promising Contender\n\nAmong the emerging contenders in the cryptocurrency space, BlockDAG Network has garnered attention for its innovative approach to blockchain scalability and efficiency and real-world use. Leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, BlockDAG Network aims to overcome the scalability limitations of traditional blockchain architectures, offering high throughput and low latency solutions for decentralized applications. With recent funding of up to $25 million and a growing community of supporters, BlockDAG Network is poised to challenge existing digital projects and reshape the future of decentralized finance.\n\nEthereum: The Surge in Value\n\nAnother key player in the cryptocurrency market experiencing a surge in value is Ethereum, the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, has witnessed a remarkable rally, driven by the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum continues to attract developers, investors, and users, cementing its position as a fundamental pillar of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the mass institutional adoption of cryptocurrency represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of finance, with Bitcoin, BlockDAG Network, and Ethereum leading the charge. As institutional investors flock to digital assets, this 2024 cryptocurrency market stands poised for unprecedented growth and innovation. While challenges and regulatory hurdles remain, the trajectory of cryptocurrency adoption points towards a future where decentralized finance becomes the cornerstone of global finance.\n\nRead About BlockDAG Presale:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram:https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "title": "Ethereum headed to \u2018the grave\u2019 if SEC rejects ETH ETFs, say analysts - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "ETH faces immense odds as the ETF deadline approaches\n\nAnalysts predict BTC or SOL as potential beneficiaries of ETH woes\n\nEthereum [ETH] could face a bumpy ride and even a massive bloodbath if recent analysts\u2019 outlook comes true.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst James Van Straten, ETH could lose more ground against Bitcoin [BTC] if the SEC rejects spot ETH ETF applications at the end of May.\n\n\u201cEthereum looks like it\u2019s going to the grave. A rejection of the spot ETF sends the ETHBTC ratio lower from 0.047 to 0.03 as a long-term projection.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decisions on most ETH ETF filings are due between late May and August. VanEck and Hashdex\u2019s decisions are due on the 23rd and the 30th of May, respectively.\n\nThese are the immediate dates the markets are tracking from next week. Straten projects that an ETF rejection could further lower the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nThe ratio tracks the value of ETH against BTC. If the ratio is 0.047, it means ETH is worth 0.047 BTC.\n\nIn an ETF rejection scenario, negative market sentiment and sell pressure could make ETH worth less in BTC terms.\n\nEthereum\u2019s inflationary \u2018state\u2019 could worsen price prospects\n\nEthereum is currently \u201cissuing\u201d more ETH than it \u201cburns,\u201d making it inflationary. This is the complete opposite of BTC\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million coins.\n\nStraten added that ETH\u2019s inflationary nature and a dip in transaction fees after the Dencun upgrade tipped Bitcoin to lead on the fees front,\n\n\u201cBitcoin fees continue to outpace ETH, with very little activity occurring on BTC. ETH has now transitioned into an inflationary state (lol). Dencun upgrade reduces transaction fees, and the ETH burn rate increases the supply.\u201d\n\nAMBCrypto evaluated ETH\u2019s inflationary state using Ultra Sound data. It showed that 4.2K ETH was burnt in the past seven days, but 17.6K ETH was issued over the same period.\n\nThat means Ethereum issued four times the token burnt last week, a massive surge in supply that could drag ETH prices down.\n\nBitcoin maximalist Fred Krueger shared the same sentiment. Krueger stated that ETH was \u201cheaded lower\u201d after Solana [SOL] outcompeted it through lower fees.\n\n\u201cBut then, they (Ethereum) get clobbered by Solana with the low fees. So, enter Phase 2. The new upgrade lowers fees and makes ETH inflationary again.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas maintained a pessimistic view on May approval for ETH ETF filings.\n\nIf rejection plays out, ETH could witness a massive bloodbath on the price charts and affect its long-term holders, who are yet to book profit.\n\nIt remains to be seen how BTC or SOL will benefit from ETH woes if the SEC rejects the ETFs starting next week."

        "title": "Ethereum, Solana and One More ETH-Rival Will Benefit From Rise of Artificial Intelligence: Real Vision Analyst - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts believes Bitcoin (BTC) and a certain breed of altcoins will be beneficiaries of artificial intelligence\u2019s (AI) rise to prominence.\n\nThe former Bloomberg analyst tells his 16,200 followers on the social media platform X that AI will need a money system, and that BTC may be the best available form.\n\nHowever, Coutts says that stablecoins and the native tokens of smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and NEAR, are also well-suited.\n\n\u201cAI needs a money.\n\nBitcoin is the best form factor, but it won\u2019t be the only one. Stablecoins and native tokens for smart contract platforms will also see widespread use.\n\nSOL ETH NEAR.\u201d\n\nCoutts recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) technology could send the total market cap of the layer-1 crypto sector soaring from the current $1.9 trillion valuation to as high as $25 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe analyst shares an excerpt from his firm\u2019s Pro-Crypto November 2023 report that suggests AI will increase the demand for on-chain verification and authentication services.\n\nThe report also says that human-directed or autonomous AI agents could make use of smart contract platforms to exchange value, significantly increasing the growth rate.\n\n\u201cBy incorporating an \u2018AI growth factor\u2019 starting in 2026, which adds 10% to the annual growth rate, we can begin to gauge this impact. Initially, the effect is modest, but by 2030, AI agents could comprise over 40% of total daily active users (DAU). This obviously creates some rather astronomical valuations for the blockchain assets, which will benefit from the transaction fees generated by an increasing number of AI agents.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn recent months, anger at the U.S. government\u2019s increasing hostility to crypto has\u2014perhaps unsurprisingly\u2014taken on a partisan flavor, with many industry leaders laying blame at the feet of individual Democrats, including President Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nBut Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin sees things differently. To him, the root cause of crypto\u2019s crisis in America may not be the fault of any individual political actor\u2014or even one political party.\n\n\u201cIt might go beyond that,\u201d Lubin said in an exclusive interview with Decrypt. \u201cThere may be some entity\u2014related, perhaps, to the banking lobby\u2014that is behind this.\u201d\n\nLubin believes that crypto and decentralization pose an existential threat to the global influence long enjoyed by the American state in cooperation with traditional finance. Thus, he figures, some nonpartisan element representing long-term American global interests may be behind the country\u2019s accelerating crypto resistance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea has echoes of what some prominent people in the crypto industry describe as \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0,\u201d popularized by Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter. The theory goes that there exists a coordinated effort at the federal level, and perhaps beyond, to make it very difficult for crypto companies to do business.\n\nThe speculative agenda borrows its name from the very real \u201cOperation Choke Point\u201d the Department of Justice ran from 2013 to 2017 that sought to unlawfully cut off payday lenders and firearms dealers from banking services. Is the same thing happening now with crypto? Lubin says it may be bigger than even that.\n\n\u201cIt's pretty obvious that the United States likes to operate top-down, to control as much of the world as it can\u2014through, especially, financial intermediaries,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cThis technology doesn't make guarantees that the bank holding companies will maintain their edge long-term.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo maybe it goes deeper,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Lubin sees it, a so-called \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d between decentralization advocates like himself and the entrenched American establishment has always been something of an inevitability. In that light, he said, the SEC\u2019s current assault on the crypto industry isn\u2019t much of a surprise or aberration.\n\nLast month, Consensys, the Ethereum software company founded by Lubin, filed a preemptive lawsuit against the SEC, challenging the regulator\u2019s reported position that the buying and selling of ETH constitutes an illegal unregistered securities offering. Lubin has previously said that an SEC victory in the case would \u201cspell the end of the Ethereum blockchain in the United States.\u201d (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAs far as Lubin\u2019s theory about Wall Street\u2019s secret hand in crypto\u2019s current woes goes, there are a couple of caveats. For one, he says, it\u2019s just speculation. And second, it\u2019s not like traditional finance has been wholly opposed to blockchain innovation: Most major banks embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs, and still more are lining up to list spot Ethereum ETFs.\n\nBut, Lubin says, profiting off crypto ETFs is a far cry from endorsing genuine decentralization. Wall Street firms could easily enrich themselves on Bitcoin ETFs while, at the same time, fighting to prevent companies like Consensys from building a decentralized future.\n\n\u201cAll of them can do well on this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn't mean they don't want to just perpetuate the system for as long as they can.\u201d"

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs see declining interest: What does it mean for the future? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Declining on-chain volume in ETH indicates waning interest ahead of ETF verdict.\n\nA financial institution predicted a delay for Ethereum ETF, but not an outright rejection.\n\nSome major events are due to happen before the end of May. But if there is one that the crypto community places at the top, it is the U.S. SEC\u2019s decision on the numerous Ethereum [ETH] ETF applications.\n\nETF stands for Exchange Traded Funds. Unlike normal cryptocurrencies like ETH, an Ethereum ETF would only expose investors to the altcoin, not that they would own it directly.\n\nBut whether this would come to pass remains a big debate subject. For some, the SEC has no other option than to approve it, since it gave Bitcoin ETFs the green light.\n\nA stumbling block appears\n\nHowever, others believe that recent developments indicate that the regulator does not share that view. One notable figure that could hinder the Ethereum ETF approval is Gary Gensler.\n\nFor some time, Gensler who is the SEC chair, has publicly stated his dislike for the crypto ecosystem. Recently, the SEC served Well Notices to some firms, including Consensys.\n\nA Wells Notice is a formal notice from the SEC written to let a recipient know that the agency is planning to bring enforcement actions against them.\n\nConsensys is a blockchain software company developed to become an Ethereum knowledge center. Since the firm has links with Ethereum, it could be possible that the SEC says a big no to the applications.\n\nHowever, J.P. Morgan had a contradicting thought to this. While the firm said it does not expect an approval this month, it noted that it won\u2019t be an outright rejection. It explained that,\n\n\u201cMarkets do not expect an approval by this month as implied by the significant discount to NAV by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE.\u201d\n\nThe SEC faces a deadline between the 23rd and 24th of May to decide. However, it seemed that the broader market was skeptical of good news coming out of the development.\n\nInterest in ETH falls\n\nThis was evident in the series of outflows from Ethereum investment products which AMBCrypto reported. In terms of the volume, we also assessed the on-chain volume.\n\nAs of this writing, the volume was 11.17 billion. This was a significant decrease from the peak in March. Declining volume in ETH is a sign that market participants are losing interest in the altcoin.\n\nIf the SEC approves the Ethereum ETF, the price of ETH might also be affected. At press time, ETH\u2019s price was $2,910. A go-ahead could send the cryptocurrency as high as $3,500.\n\nBut if this is not the case, the potential decline to $2,700 might come to pass. However, eyes would be on two major applications, which are from VanEck and ARK.\n\nApplicants are closing the loopholes\n\nPreviously, ARK and 21 shares, who have a joint application, included staking in their Ethereum ETF filing. But in an amended submission on the 10th of May, they changed it.\n\nThe firms had hoped that staking would be included and added it as a feature in February. The rationale for the inclusion was that ETH could have served as part of the company\u2019s income.\n\nBut the fact that the SEC still has issues with labeling the cryptocurrency a security or not, left them with no option to be on the safe side. However, this does not imply that the Ethereum ETF would get a nod.\n\nIn the meantime, J.P. Morgan also commented on the possibility of a delay.\n\nAccording to the financial institution, a denial could cause a lawsuit, like the way Grayscale took the regulator to court before the Bitcoin ETFs were approved.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nThis is because Grayscale had also applied to convert its Ethereum Trust to an ETF. The viewpoint read,\n\n\u201cThe template is likely to be similar to bitcoin: with futures-based Ethereum ETFs already approved, the SEC ( if it denies the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs) is likely to face a legal challenge and eventually lose\u201d\n\nDespite the anticipated verdict, the number of ETH holders has been increasing. According to Santiment, the total amount of participants holding ETH was over 12o million."

        "content": "SEC could reject spot ETH ETF application based on \u2018security\u2019 status.\n\nMixed feelings on possible SEC\u2019s rejection grounds as ETH price dropped.\n\nThe US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has been quiet on the status of Ethereum [ETH] and whether it will approve the spot ETH ETF filings.\n\nHowever, a recent development indicates that the agency could reject the ETF applications and raise ETH\u2019s security status issue.\n\nReacting to a recent SEC\u2019s notice on spot ETF filings, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart doubled his odds of the agency\u2019s rejection of the applications. Seyffart commented,\n\n\u201cLooks like odds just went up for SEC to deny Ethereum ETFs by claiming #Ethereum is a security. Not a guarantee that they will do this, but I think this almost guarantees that the SEC is at least considering it.\u201d\n\nMixed feelings about possible Ethereum ETF rejection\n\nThe overall market has been expecting a rejection of ETH ETF applications in May. The above development could shed some light on the possible grounds for the agency\u2019s move.\n\nHowever, Nate Geraci of ETF Store wasn\u2019t convinced the agency had a sound ground for rejecting the spot ETF applications.\n\nCiting the recent removal of staking features and existing ETH futures amongst others, Geraci wondered,\n\n\u201cIf SEC denies spot eth ETFs, what will rationale be\u2026Lack of correlation b/w spot & futures market? Then why approve eth futures ETFs. ETH = security? Then why approve eth futures ETFs. Staking? Issuers have (reluctantly) removed. I don\u2019t see path for legal disapproval here.\u201d\n\nLast week, ARK and 21 Shares removed staking features on their spot ETH ETF application. Some market watchers read the update as a possible approval by the SEC.\n\nThe sentiment was quickly reflected by the uptick in the chance of May ETH ETF approval on the prediction market, Polymarket.\n\nApproval chances jumped from 9% on the 10th of May (ARK\u2019s update) to 16% on the 13th of May.\n\nHowever, the revelation of SEC\u2019s possible ETF rejection and raising of ETH\u2019s \u2018security\u2019 status saw the approval chance drop to 13% on Polymarket at the time of writing.\n\nSeyffart\u2019s colleague, Eric Balchunas, also echoed his sentiment. Reacting to SEC\u2019s spot ETF notice, Balchunas said,\n\n\u201cTLDR: the SEC asked commenters re the Eth spot ETFs whether these filers have properly filed their ETF listing proposals as commodities. This shows the SEC is perhaps considering to ETH is a security in their denial. Our odds of approval remain the same: slim to none.\u201d\n\nArk Invest and 21 Shares ETH ETF applications are due for the SEC\u2019s decision next week, the 24th of May. The decision on the Hashdex application will be on the 30th of May.\n\nHowever, pessimistic views on the SEC\u2019s spot ETF approval have dragged ETH\u2019s price down.\n\nThe king of altcoins has been in a price downtrend since mid-March \u2013 a bearish market structure that could push ETH to $2500 or lower."

After a sequence of lower highs, BTC could change the market structure if it manages a stable close above the $65,500 resistance level.\n\nThis is likely, provided BTC holders keep their profit appetite in check and buyer momentum increases. The higher lows on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show a growing bullish trend. Traders looking to enter long positions for BTC may consider waiting for a higher reading on the RSI.\n\nA stable close above $65,500 on the one-day time frame would encourage more buy orders, with the ensuing buying pressure sending Bitcoin price to $70,000. Beyond this level, BTC would have a chance at taking back the $73,777 peak. Notably, the DXY Compare indicator is also dropping, which has often displayed a countercurrent flow against BTC price.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if traders book profits for the Wednesday god candle, Bitcoin price could drop. A slip below $63,354 would spook panic sellers like it did on two recent occasions, May 9 and 13, where BTC was rejected from the aforementioned level.\n\nIn a dire case, Bitcoin price could descend below the ascending trendline and ultimately fall below the $60,630 support level. Below this level, BTC could roll over to $58,000, or worse, $56,552, levels last tested on May 1.\n\nAlso Read: Will GameStop stock resurgence have downstream effect on BTC and alts?\n\n$3,212 level is critical for Ethereum price\u2019s upside potential\n\nEthereum price is attempting to reclaim ground above the ascending trendline after a slip below on Tuesday. The governing chart pattern is a falling wedge, which is a bullish reversal technical formation. For the 26% target objective to be realized, however, ETH must manage a candlestick close above $3,212.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, increased seller momentum could see Ethereum price drop. If the slump extends to close below $2,781, it would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nNotably, the RSI continues to chop sideways with equal lows as it remains subdued below the mean level of 50. This shows the bears still have the upper hand.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum faces key resistance in attempt at short-term bull run, Solana flips ETH Mainnet in terms of revenue\n\nXRP bulls sitting on their hands\n\nRipple price remains range-bound as XRP bulls continue to sit on their hands. This is seen with the RSI stuck below the mean level of 50 since April 11. If the RSI records a higher high within the upper segment of the range, Ripple price could extend the climb.\n\nIn the meantime, Ripple price is likely to consolidate along the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $0.4952, with the horizontal chop likely to continue.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, enhanced profit-booking could see Ripple price wipe out the ground covered, slipping below $0.4952. In a dire case, XRP price could extend the fall to $0.4500, or worse, extend a leg down to $0.4188, levels last tested on April 13.\n\nAlso Read: XRP holds gains as attorneys debate relevance of discounts offered to Ripple\u2019s institutional clients"

        "content": "Ethereum loses ultrasound money status.\n\nTotal supply has increased by over 100,000.\n\nEthereum [ETH] has transitioned from being labeled \u201cultrasound money\u201d due to the EIP-1559 upgrade, which has altered its deflationary characteristics.\n\nThis upgrade reduced Ethereum\u2019s burn rate, leading to a slowdown in the rate at which Ether is removed from circulation.\n\nThe total supply of ETH has increased, and there has been a recent rise in the supply of ETH on exchanges. How does the supply on exchanges compare to the total supply?\n\nEthereum total supply and fees burnt display contrasting trends\n\nThe analysis of Ethereum\u2019s supply metric on CryptoQuant reveals notable fluctuations in total supply dynamics over recent months.\n\nFrom November 2023 to early April 2024, there was a discernible decrease in ETH\u2019s total supply, dropping from over 120.2 million to approximately 120.06 million, marking a reduction of over 100,000 Ether.\n\nHowever, beginning from the 19th of April, Ethereum\u2019s total supply started to ascend, reaching around 120.1 million at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis recent increase in total supply is attributed to a decline in the fees burnt, which commenced following the Dencum upgrade.\n\nAn examination of the fees burnt metric illustrates a significant decrease, starting around March.\n\nDuring this period, fees burnt were approximately 6,000 Ether, contrasting sharply with the current value of around 890 ETH at the time of this analysis.\n\nThis significant reduction in fees burnt accounts for the observed uptick in Ethereum\u2019s total supply, indicating a shift in its deflationary dynamics.\n\nAlso, the decline in fees burn is due to the decline in fees on the network.\n\nEthereum sees a decline in overall fees\n\nThe recent Ethereum upgrade has led to a reduction in transaction fees, both on the main network and its Layer 2 solutions.\n\nData from Coin98 Analytics indicated that Ethereum transaction fees has reached a yearly low, averaging 0.00017E, which translates to approximately $0.5 per transaction.\n\nThis fees marks a significant decrease compared to levels observed around February.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the overall fees generated on the Ethereum network revealed a noticeable decline in recent times.\n\nAs of this writing, the total fees were around $3.6 million, contrasting sharply with the peak recorded in March, which stood at approximately $7.8 million.\n\nThis downward trend in fees commenced about a month ago.\n\nEthereum supply on exchanges climbs\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum exchange supply indicates a notable upward trend, albeit with some interesting nuances.\n\nThe increase in exchange supply began before the total supply started to rise, with the growth, observed between March and press time, amounting to over 3 million Ether.\n\nAs of this writing, the total exchange supply was over 16.8 million.\n\nDespite this significant growth, the exchange supply remained relatively low compared to the total supply of Ethereum. This suggests that Ethereum is facing a manageable risk of oversupply.\n\nFurthermore, the proportionately low exchange supply indicates that the current price of Ethereum is not under immediate threat from inflationary pressures.\n\nETH continues to trend below $3,000\n\nAnalysis of the Ethereum price trend on the daily timeframe is reflecting a challenging period. Following its drop below the $3,000 price level in the previous week, ETH has struggled to regain its footing.\n\nAs of this writing, it was trading at around $2,900, experiencing a decline of approximately 1.5%.\n\nRead Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nBoth the Stochastic indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) were signaling a negative price trend. The RSI, in particular, indicated a bearish trend as it remained below the neutral line.\n\nHowever, the current position of these indicators suggested a potential price reversal in the near future, with ETH poised for a possible uptick."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled a official notice regarding the approval of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The notice, brought to light by finance lawyer Scott Johnson, highlights the critical scrutiny facing the proposed ETF. Moreover, it highlights potential hurdles in its path to approval.\n\nSEC To Debate On ETH Classification Before Spot Ethereum ETF Decision\n\nJohnson, a prominent figure in the crypto space, took to social media platform X to reveal the contents of the official notice. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m aware this is widely considered a possibility, but this is your official notice that the SEC is considering the security question for ETH in this upcoming spot ETF order.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe crux of the matter revolves around whether the proposed Ethereum ETF aligns with regulatory standards. This particularly considers the investment product\u2019s classification under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) as Commodity-Based Trust Shares. Furthermore, Johnson emphasized the SEC\u2019s obligation under 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(B) to provide notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration, citing concerns over the Trust\u2019s underlying assets and their classification.\n\nThe official notice, as cited by Johnson, states: \u201cPursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act, the Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change\u2019s consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ether ETFs See Record Net Outflows Since Launch\n\nPotential Implications On Ether ETF Decision\n\nSpecifically, the SEC is probing whether the Ethereum Trusts have properly filed its proposal to list and trade the shares, considering the nature of the underlying assets and their compliance with regulatory standards. Johnson\u2019s revelation sheds light on the potential roadblocks facing the Ethereum ETF approval process.\n\nIn a X thread, he remarked, \u201cThe obvious purpose is to potentially deny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they are holding a security.\u201d Moreover, he highlighted the SEC\u2019s conflicting stance on the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the Ethereum ETF decision.\n\nJohnson underscored that the SEC never questioned the classification of the Bitcoin Spot/Futures ETFs while it\u2019s the total opposite in case of ETH ETFs. However, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Consensys\u2019 actions against the SEC are also responsible for raising these questions.\n\nThe CFTC has always considered ETH to be a commodity while the SEC was mulling on whether to declare it a security upon Prometheum\u2019s request. Meanwhile, Ethereum developer Consensys issued a lawsuit against the SEC last month. The firm urged the agency to not label ETH as a security.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Price: What\u2019s Happening With ETH Price Today: May 13, 2024?\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

        "content": "ETH was trading at a significant support level.\n\nKey technical indicators hint at the possibility of a continued decline in ETH\u2019s value.\n\nLeading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] is clinging to a crucial support level as its price trends within a descending channel.\n\nA descending channel is formed when an asset\u2019s price continues to make lower highs and lower lows, indicating a broader downward trend.\n\nReadings from ETH\u2019s price movements on a daily chart revealed the formation of this channel on 12 March. Since then, the coin\u2019s value has declined by 28%.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap\u2019s data, the altcoin exchanged hands at $2915 as of this writing.\n\nA break below or a break above?\n\nIf ETH bulls fail to defend the coin\u2019s current support level of $2,850, its price might initiate a decline below the lower trendline of the descending channel.\n\nIf this happens, the altcoin will exchange hands at the $2600 level.\n\nAMBCrypto\u2019s assessments of some key technical indicators hinted at the possibility of a break below the current support level.\n\nFor example, ETH\u2019s key momentum indicators signaled that the coin\u2019s sell-offs outpaced its accumulation among market participants.\n\nThe coin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned below their respective neutral spots at press time. ETH\u2019s RSI was 39.52, while its MFI was 49.39.\n\nETH\u2019s Elder-Ray Index returned a negative value, confirming the current bearish trend. This indicator measures the relationship between the strength of buyers and sellers in the market.\n\nWhen it returns a negative value, it means that bear power is dominant in the market.\n\nLikewise, the dots that make up ETH\u2019s Parabolic SAR were spotted above its price at press time. These dots have been so positioned since the beginning of May.\n\nThe Parabolic SAR indicator is used to identify potential trend direction and reversals. When its dotted lines are placed above an asset\u2019s price, the market is said to be in a decline.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIt indicates that the asset\u2019s price has been falling and may continue.\n\nShould ETH bears force a break below the current support level, the coin\u2019s next price point might be $2780. However, if this projection is invalidated, the altcoin might rally above $3000."

        "title": "3 Meme Coins Outperforming Ethereum In May 2024 - CoinGape",
        "content": "Following the recent market crash that jolted the cryptocurrency world, there has been a significant change in the market dynamics. With Ethereum (ETH) staying at $2,915.90, experiencing declines of 1.76%, 4.93%, and 5.68% in the last day, week, and month, investors are looking for safety in other investments. The crypto sphere was shaken by the recent market crash, causing traditional assets and cryptocurrencies to suffer in the aftermath. Nevertheless, in the midst of such turmoil, memecoins have risen as unexpected saviors, going against market norms and surpassing even well-known giants such as Ethereum. Pepe Coin (PEPE), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and GameStop (GME) are some of the emerging stars in the crypto world, grabbing attention with their rapid growth and causing a stir in the industry.\n\nWhat is the reason behind the surge of Meme Coins?\n\nThe revival of meme coins gained notable momentum following the GameStop rally on Wall Street, a phenomenon that caused a stir in financial markets. The GME stock price surged after Keith Gill, also known as TheRoaringKitty, tweeted for the first time, after three years, and having been associated with Gamestop.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFollowing the rally, the meme coin industry experienced a huge increase of 34% in daily trading volume, resulting in a significant addition of $5 billion to investors\u2019 wealth. This sudden change of circumstances brought memecoins into the spotlight, igniting a wave of new interest and investment madness.\n\nTop 3 Memecoins Outperforming Ethereum\n\nPEPE, FLOKI and Gamestop (GME) have emerged as best performing meme coins today, outperforming ETH.\n\n1. Pepe Coin (PEPE)\n\nPEPE, named after the famous internet meme, has been making waves in the crypto world with its performance. Currently trading at $0.00001092, PEPE price has seen a surge of 22.69% in the past 24 hours, and a 33.84% increase over the past week.\n\nWith a market cap of $4.6 billion and a trading volume of $2.4 billion in the last 24 hours, PEPE is proving to be a force to be reckoned with. Its circulating supply stands at 420,689,899,999,995 PEPE, indicating a strong investor interest in this memecoin.\n\n2. FLOKI\n\nTaking cues from Dogecoin price achievements and its Shiba Inu mascot, FLOKI has intrigued investors with its dog-inspired branding. FLOKI is now valued at $0.0001949, with a slight 10.83% rise in the last day and a consistent 9.66% jump in the previous week. Having a market capitalization of $1.86 billion and a trading volume of $497.6 million over the past 24 hours, FLOKI is establishing itself in the memecoin market. The circulating supply of 9,556,698,553,895 FLOKI shows increasing interest from both traders and investors.\n\n3. GameStop (GME)\n\nFollowing the infamous GameStop rally on Wall Street, GameStop Corp. (GME) has entered the realm of memecoins in a daring manner. Priced at $0.01178 now, GME has experienced a 290.97% rise in the last day and a1588.16% growth in the past week.\n\nGME has become popular among fans of memes due to its market cap of $81.1 million and trading volume of $177.2 million in the past day. The circulating supply of this memecoin has not been established yet, but the excitement surrounding it is undeniable.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Ethereum is facing challenges after a recent market downturn, meme coins such as PEPE, FLOKI, and GameStop are taking advantage of the moment to stand out. These meme coins are captivating traders and investors globally with their unique themes, viral marketing, and fast value surges. Although the future success of memecoins is unknown, it is evident that memes are influential in the constantly changing world of cryptocurrency. It will be interesting to observe the performance of these memes coins in the coming weeks and months as the market recovers and adjusts."

        "content": "Wed 15 May 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nConsensys, leader in the Ethereum ecosystem, has just announced the launch of Smart Transactions, a new optional feature on MetaMask that promises users safer, faster, and cheaper transactions. This major innovation aims to solve recurring issues faced by crypto users.\n\nA New Era for Ethereum Transactions\n\nMetaMask users now have the option to enable Smart Transactions, a revolutionary feature offered by Consensys.\n\nAvailable as an option for users worldwide, this solution aims to optimize the user experience by improving transaction success rates, reducing gas fees, and protecting against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks such as front-running and sandwich trading.\n\nAccording to the analysis by EigenPhi, these forms of MEV have cost Ethereum users the astronomical sum of 124,000 ETH, or more than 350 million dollars, in the year 2023 alone. With Smart Transactions, users\u2019 transactions remain confidential until their on-chain confirmation, making it impossible for malicious bots to exploit them.\n\nFurthermore, users benefit from higher success rates and reduced gas costs thanks to the presimulation of each Smart Transaction via MetaMask\u2019s just-in-time simulation service. The real-time status of the transaction is also directly displayed in the MetaMask wallet, offering increased visibility and peace of mind.\n\nThese improvements build on a new mempool virtualization technology developed by Special Mechanisms Group, Consensys\u2019 advanced research division. The whole package offers users more privacy, control, and visibility over their crypto transactions.\n\nConcrete Benefits for Users\n\nIn beta tests, Smart Transactions achieved a success rate of 99.5%, significantly higher than industry standards. Users save money by avoiding costly frontrunnings and failed transactions. They can also track the status of transactions in real-time directly in MetaMask.\n\nJason Linehan, director of SMG, emphasizes the importance for users to better manage their transactions sent to the blockchain. In 2023 alone, more than 52,000 ETH (153 million dollars) were wasted in failed transactions, while sophisticated bots profited from transactions after their submission.\n\nGal Eldar, executive director of products at MetaMask, acknowledges the complexity and frustration associated with submitting transactions on a distributed network. Smart Transactions aims to address these issues head-on.\n\nIn summary, with the launch of Smart Transactions, Consensys is taking a major step in its quest for a more efficient and user-friendly Ethereum ecosystem. By offering MetaMask users safer, cheaper, and more transparent transactions, this innovation could mark a turning point in the mass adoption of cryptos. It remains to be seen how its gradual deployment and impact on the market will unfold in the coming days.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

Bitcoin led the pack with $39.5 million in liquidations.\n\nThe price drop influenced the derivatives market's sentiment as traders taking short positions on Bitcoin sharply increased vis \u00e0 vis those gunning for price increases in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe negative sentiment permeated as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 0.5% increase in wholesale prices in April, higher than analysts' estimates, lowering expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 8:30 p.m. EDT) Ethena (ENA) +4.10% $0.8947 Lido DAO (LDO) +3.11% $1.97 UNUS SED LEO (LEO) +2.61% $5.93\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.24 trillion, shrinking 2.12% in the past 24 hours.\n\nIn contrast, the equities market surged on the day.

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nEthereum plummets down breaking support zones and still relying on the main uptrend support of $2880.\n\nThe overall trend trunks bearish again after increased selling pressure.\n\nA reversal can be seen if the buyers keep the price above MA lines ( $2900)\n\nThe biggest altcoin Ethereum(ETH) was rejected at $2996 and now heading down toward the main uptrend support level at $2880. Currently trading at $2902 with a 24-hour drop of 2.48% and a weekly drop of 5.64%. The downtrend that started after April 13 could never be reversed so far.\n\nOn the upside moment, the buyers have failed to maintain the price above moving averages.\n\nThe 1 hr ETH/USDT Chart says it all, forming a long-standing down-channel in the same range with price reading below the 50 days and 200 SMA isn\u2019t a bull favorable trend. The RSI being more unstable at 35 indicates a slightly unsustainable trend.\n\nDencun, and Spot ETF Approval On The Reason Board\n\nEthereum\u2019s downtrend can be seen to be the impact of unfulfilled demands by the Dencun upgrade that was released in March 204. The upgrade was a layer 2 blockchain upgrade to reduce time, and fees and increase the scalability of the network.\n\nThe other major impact is the unapproved and long-anticipated Ethereum ETF approval. The recent crackdown on SEC indicates a prolonged wait for the approvals to be in 2025.\n\nInterestingly, today on 14 May data revealed by the analyst \u201c Data Nerd\u201d shows multiple whale withdrawals. In 24 hours, a total of 78,301 ETH were withdrawn from the exchange wallet. This can also be seen as a sign of accumulations, leading retail buyers to charge up.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The US Security Exchanges Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, August 22 announced that it has disapproved of a proposed rule change that would have allowed investors to trade nine different Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on various exchanges.\n\nCoinfomania previously reported that the disapproved bitcoin ETFs include a pair of requests from Proshares, five from Direxion, also for listing on NYSE Arca and two proposals from GraniteShares, for listing on CBOE.\n\nThis sad news, coupled with reports of a new and strict regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and ICOs in China, left the crypto markets on red earlier today after short-term gains from the previous trading day. But as usual, corrections soon followed.\n\nWith so much sorry saga about the approval of a bitcoin ETF by the SEC, some experts in the industry have concluded that there are very slim chances for the approval of a BTC ETF this year.\n\nHowever, a new report has revealed that there is still some hope of a reversal on the sad decision for Bitcoin enthusiasts. SEC commission Hector Pierce, who has been famous for lending her support to cryptocurrencies, confirmed in a tweet that the number of the rejected ETFs have stayed pending a second review by the Commission.\n\nYesterday\u2019s staff orders disapproving SRO rules related to a number of bitcoin ETFs are stayed pending Commission review. See, for example: https://t.co/Ky9Z8t1E4q \u2014 Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) August 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\u201cIn English: the Commission (Chairman and Commissioners) delegates some tasks to its staff. When the staff acts in such cases, it acts on behalf of the Commission. The Commission may review the staff\u2019s action, as will now happen here,\u201d Pierce explained further.\u201d\n\nAccording to a letter from the SEC, addressed to Eugene Schlanger, Senior Counsel of the NYSE Group, the Commission will review the disapproval order, but the order is still valid until the SEC revokes it.\n\nAlthough this report from the Commission does not in any way imply that the decision will be reversed, it has, to a large extent, put a smile on the faces of crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAlso, recall that Coinfomania reported two weeks ago that the SEC\u2019s final decision of the Winklevoss twins Bitcoin ETF proposal had been scheduled for September 30, 2018. These events have made members of the crypto community remain optimistic that a bitcoin ETF could happen this year.\n\nDo you think one of these BTC ETF applications would be approved?"
