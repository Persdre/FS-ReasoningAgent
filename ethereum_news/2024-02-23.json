        "title": "$15,000 Ethereum Price Incoming, Predicts Hedge Fund Veteran Mark Yusko \u2013 Here\u2019s the Timeline - The Daily Hodl",
        "content": "The CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital Mark Yusko believes that Ethereum (ETH) could appreciate to a five-figure price.\n\nYusko says in a new Altcoin Daily interview that based on the Ethereum versus Bitcoin ratio (ETH/BTC), ETH could go up by 410% from its present level in a scenario where Bitcoin ends up hitting the $150,000 mark.\n\n\u201cI probably have no reason to go against what has existed for a long time which is the ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It used to be almost exactly 10-to-1. So if Bitcoin was $20,000, Ethereum would be $2,000\u2026\n\nSo let\u2019s say Bitcoin gets to $150,000 like I think it will. And let\u2019s say we don\u2019t go all the way back to [a Bitcoin-to-Ethereum ratio of] 10-to-1 but we go to\u2026 Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1.5. So that\u2019s [an Ethereum price of] $10,000.\n\nI think there are a lot of people that have that number in their brain. And a lot of people say, \u2018Well that\u2019s not enough.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s say it gets all the way back to 10-to-1. Then that would be [an Ethereum price of] $15,000. So, comfortably somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,921 at time of writing.\n\nOn Ethereum\u2019s expected price performance relative to that of Bitcoin (BTC), the hedge fund veteran says,\n\n\u201cI could see a bigger rally in Ethereum than Bitcoin. And that\u2019s kind of what you would expect in the pump part, in the final meteoric parabolic move. Ethereum has historically outperformed Bitcoin and it probably should again.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $51,904 at time of writing.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "AI Tokens Resist Cooling Crypto Market as Bitcoin, Ethereum Wobble - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter a month of bullish activity, the broader cryptocurrency market is settling as the week draws to a close. Major currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading relatively flat, reflecting a pause in recent upward momentum.\n\nArtificial intelligence-linked tokens are still going strong, however, buoyed by the current momentum within the AI industry, which is sparking increased investor interest and activity in related digital assets.\n\nIndeed, after Nvidia's blockbuster earnings report this week, tradfi stocks related to AI tech are all on the rise: NVDA, AMD, and MSFT on the Nasdaq are all in the green for the week. Nvidia called it a \u201ctipping point\u201d for AI.\n\nBitcoin's current market position\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin opened the day at $51,252 but slightly decreased to around $51,134, marking just short of a 1% drop within the last 24 hours. This movement underscores a trading sideways period consistent since February 15, as Decrypt previously reported.\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency's current position below its EMA10 mark (the average price of the last 10 days) raises concerns about a strong correction. Closing the day under this critical threshold could suggest that bearish forces are gaining a foothold in the market.\n\nSome market indicators signal that a correction might already be underway.\n\nThe RSI\u2014an indicator that measures the strength of bulls over bears in a market\u2014was previously at an exceptionally high 80 points (meaning 8 out of every 10 traders were buying), but has decreased to 66 points. Although still high, this reduction suggests a shift towards a more balanced market dynamic and shows that traders are not as crazy about BTC as they were just a few days ago.\n\nThe convergence of Bitcoin's EMA10 and EMA55 points to a narrowing gap between short-term and long-term buying performance. This trend suggests a cooling off, where recent buyers (who bought BTC during the last 10 days) are not seeing the same returns as those who entered the market earlier (in the last 55 days). It also explains why the RSI is also dropping.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf this correction continues and the EMA55 crosses above the EMA10, it could mean that the correction may be turning into a bearish trend that leaves newer buyers facing losses.\n\nThe current market is weighing the potential impacts of recent spot ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving. The halving has historically influenced Bitcoin's value, sparking a major bull run every four years, and could play a significant role in shaping future market trends.\n\nEthereum's market dynamics\n\nEthereum opened the day at $2,970 but has experienced a 1.4% drop, with its price adjusting to $2,947 by the time of this report. This movement reflects a stronger intra-day decline compared to Bitcoin.\n\nDespite a stronger bullish trend earlier, Ethereum has not maintained its momentum this week. The appearance of a Doji candlestick in yesterday's trading session indicates a potential shift in market dynamics.\n\nThe Doji descriptor is used when a candlestick is flat and has no body\u2014in other words, the price doesn\u2019t move during the session. Yesterday, ETH started the day at $2,967 and ended at $2,968, signaling indecision among traders.\n\nThis pattern indicates a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side gaining significant ground, and suggests that Ethereum's dominant bullish trend may be weakening.\n\nEthereum's weekly performance remains positive, though, with a 6% gain over the last seven days. However, this growth is modest compared to the substantial increases seen in previous weeks. Last week, it spiked 14.89%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe observed deceleration in Ethereum's value growth suggests a potential for minor corrections. These adjustments may be influenced by Bitcoin's market movements, as altcoins often follow the lead of the flagship cryptocurrency.\n\nFor long-term Ethereum holders, the current market conditions still present a bullish outlook. Despite the potential for short-term corrections, the overall trend supports holding onto the coin\u2014for now.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "While a possible spot Ethereum ETF approval looms ahead, Grayscale experts believe an upcoming technological improvement is behind recent price upticks.\n\nGrayscale research analyst William Ogden Moore said in a Feb. 23 report that Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade has most likely triggered rallies in Ether (ETH) prices. According to CoinMarkerCap, ETH is up 34% in the last 30 days and 28% year-to-date per TradingView.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13th, 2024, represents a major step forward and could help Ethereum compete in terms of scalability with faster chains in the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector, such as Solana. We believe that recent price performance reflects the market\u2019s anticipation of this upgrade. William Ogden Moore, Grayscale research analyst\n\nETH 30D price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nYou might also like: Coinbase calls on SEC to approve Grayscale\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF\n\nDencun promises to uplift throughput and reduce transaction costs, allowing users to spend less gas fees and make more transactions on ETH\u2019s mainnet and layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum.\n\nDevelopers plan to achieve this key overhaul via proto-danksharding, introducing data blobs.\n\nMoore\u2019s report suggests that Ethereum could seize greater smart contract business share from competitors like Solana if the network can offer cheaper fees. Moore opined that this might unlock a multi-billion market tied to real-world assets.\n\nIf Ethereum can simply become more competitive in throughput and cost, it could position itself to capture smart contract applications that demand high levels of security and censorship-resistance like stablecoins or tokenized financial assets. William Ogden Moore, Grayscale research analyst\n\nGrayscale\u2019s bullish outlook on ETH and its blockchain complements the investment firm\u2019s bid for a spot exchange-traded fund following its successful GBTC conversion last month. According to Yahoo Finance, the company hopes to do the same with its Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which holds over $7 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nThe U.S. SEC delayed a decision on Grayscale\u2019s application till May, along with several other issuers.\n\nETH YTD chart | Source: TradingView"

        "content": "Zircuit has attracted over $128 million in deposits within the first 24 hours since opening deposits.\n\nIt is backed by notable investors including Pantera, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom, and introduces \"sequencer level security.\"\n\nZircuit allows for the staking of restaked and staked Ether.\n\nA new Ethereum Layer 2 network, Zircuit, enables the staking of restaked and staked Ether.\n\nYes, you read that right.\n\nOver $128 million has already been deposited in Zircuit since deposits opened in the last 24 hours, all before Zircuit\u2019s mainnet has even gone live.\n\nZircuit is backed by Pantera, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom and considers itself an Ethereum zero-knowledge layer 2 network. One of the key features Zircuit introduces is what it has dubbed, \u201csequencer level security.\u201d\n\nZircuit monitors the mempool, the backlog of pending transactions on a blockchain, and searches for malicious transactions to prevent their inclusion in a block.\n\nEssentially, if a hack or exploit is detected, the Zircuit network has the ability to stop it in its tracks.\n\nDeposits now sit in a smart contract on Ethereum, and once the Zircuit mainnet goes live, users will have the option to migrate to the mainnet or withdraw at any time without penalties.\n\nUntil then, users can earn yield and points on their deposits. This includes the yield from Ether staking, EigenLayer points, liquid restaking protocol points, and Zircuit points.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nFor users who want to experiment on Zircuit\u2019s testnet, it is already live.\n\nEigenLayer is a new protocol within the Ethereum ecosystem that extends Ethereum\u2019s security across blockchain networks by implementing restaking. The launch of the EigenLayer mainnet \u2014 the core blockchain infrastructure \u2014 is slated for the second quarter.\n\nZircuit accepts deposits in Ether, in liquid staking token stETH or in any of the following liquid restaking tokens: ezETH, rswETH, rsETH, and LsETH.\n\nThe largest depositor so far is wallet address, 1ef2, who has deposited over $22 million so far in stETH and rsETH tokens.\n\nPoints are part of a wider trend in crypto that generally precede a forthcoming airdrop. Users earn points, which are later migrated to tradable tokens in the future just by using these protocols.\n\nStaking restaked staked Ether\n\nStaking Ether secures the Ethereum network and offers users an annual percentage yield of 3%-4%.\n\nUsers can run their own node to stake, which involves a certain level of technical knowledge and at least 32 Ether, or they can use a liquid staking protocol like Lido that abstracts away the technical know-how and capital requirements of staking.\n\nRestaking Ether involves depositing a liquid staked token, like stETH from Lido, into EigenLayer, a buzzy new Ethereum protocol that extends Ethereum\u2019s security to other blockchain networks through restaking.\n\nCurrently, because the EigenLayer mainnet is still not live, staked Ether that is restaked with EigenLayer, or one of the many liquid restaking protocols, does not earn any additional yield, but earns EigenLayer points. It is expected when EigenLayer\u2019s mainnet is live, restaked Ether will earn an additional yield.\n\nAdditionally, these liquid restaking protocols offer their own points on top of the EigenLayer points.\n\nFinally, users can take their liquid restaked tokens, which are already earning the Ether staking yield, EigenLayer points, and liquid restaking protocol points and deposit them into Zircuit to earn Zircuit points. Or, users can choose to just deposit staked Ether.\n\nPoints are generally non-transferable, but one protocol, Whales Market, has opened up a secondary market for these points.\n\nPoints for EigenLayer have already seen over $2.1 million in total volume at an average price of $0.14, giving the estimated 1.7 billion points in circulation a market cap of $250 million.\n\nRyan Celaj is DL News\u2019 New York-based Data Correspondent.

        "content": "Dencun and Electra upgrades shape Ethereum\u2019s development landscape.\n\nETH\u2019s price witnessed a minor correction, while network growth and velocity fell.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ethereum [ETH] experienced a substantial surge in its price, reflecting heightened market activity. Behind this surge was significant developments within the Ethereum network, poised to propel the growth of this cryptocurrency further.\n\nNew updates\n\nThe recent Ethereum developers\u2019 call, ACDC #128, unveiled crucial updates set to shape the network\u2019s future. The eagerly awaited Dencun upgrade took center stage, with all client teams (excluding lodestar) finalizing software versions.\n\nThese versions, along with the lodestar candidate client, are undergoing thorough testing on a mainnet shadow fork.\n\nFlashbots, a key player, plans to release Dendon-ready MEV-Boost software early next week.\n\nNotably, the Dencun mainnet activation is scheduled for 13th March, emphasizing the urgency for validator node operators to upgrade their EL, CL, and MEV-Boost software promptly.\n\nThe impact of the Cancun upgrade is poised to be significant. With Flashbots gearing up to enhance MEV-Boost capabilities, the Ethereum network anticipates increased efficiency and security, potentially influencing market sentiment positively.\n\nAnother pivotal development on the horizon is the Electra upgrade. Developers have initiated work on Electra, encompassing EIP 6110, EIP 7002, and EIP 7549. These proposals aim to enhance validator deposits, triggerable exits in the execution layer, and reposition committee index outside attestation, respectively.\n\nFurther refinement and consideration of inclusion lists will determine their seamless integration into Electra without delaying other essential code changes.\n\nIn parallel, discussions on lowering staking rewards have emerged. As the amount of staked ETH rises, stakeholders engage in deliberations on potentially reducing ETH issuance.\n\nThis ongoing discourse is critical, as it signifies the Ethereum community\u2019s commitment to adapt and optimize network dynamics in response to changing conditions.\n\nHow is ETH doing?\n\nDespite these advancements, Ethereum\u2019s price, at $2,935.49, reflects a 2.63% decline in the last 24 hours. More notably, network growth for the ETH token has experienced a decline, signaling waning interest among new users.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nA lack of interest from new addresses could severely impact the ability of ETH\u2019s price to see green.\n\nMoreover, the velocity of ETH being transferred also declined. The reduced velocity indicated a lower frequency of interactions around ETH, suggesting a potential decrease in overall engagement."

The price of Bitcoin is now at $51,064, after a modest 2% weekly drop.\n\nCash had flooded into the market as retail investors showed interest in the newly approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but that has finally slowed.\n\nStill, the asset is up significantly since the start of the year, when it was trading for $42,245 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Ethereum (ETH) has been the star of the week. The price of ETH crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, and now it's trading for $2,956, a 6% jump over the past seven days.\n\nInvestors are interested in the asset again as more major Wall Street firms apply to release a spot Ethereum ETF. The SEC has until May to approve or deny such a product.\n\nAnd Uniswap (UNI), the 16th biggest token, is doing really well: it's up 66% this week and priced at $12.41. It shot up sharply yesterday on news that the foundation behind the popular decentralized exchange wants to overhaul the governance system to reward users who stake the token.\n\nThe idea is a \"large-scale upgrade to Uniswap protocol governance to incentivize active, engaged, and thoughtful delegation,\" the foundation said. A vote will come in March.\n\nOver the past week, UNI has been the best-performing cryptocurrency out of the top 20 coins and tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy far, though, the most impressive performers have been AI tokens, which boomed along with AI sticks after Nvidia's earnings report. The top chipmaker reported $22.1 billion in revenue in the final quarter of 2023, beating analyst estimates.\n\nAs a result, AI-associated digital assets are soaring. Worldcoin (WLD) is up 71% over the past seven days, while SingularityNET (AGIX) doubled before settling at a 71% gain for the week.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

A new concept would protect transactions from being censored by malicious validators, but still needs some further engineering and economic evaluations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiple Ethereum (ETH) block proposers to prevent censorship: Research\n\nYesterday, on Feb. 23, 2023, the Concurrent Block Proposers in Ethereum thesis was published by SMG head researcher Max Resnick and Ethereum Foundation's Mike Neuder. The paper covers the prospects of increasing the number of proposers in a single PoS Ethereum (ETH) slot.\n\nConcurrent Block Proposers in Ethereum\n\n\n\nBy:\n\n- mikeneuder\n\n- max\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/4Uk1DZGpDU\n\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Introducing multiple proposers per slot in Ethereum could significantly increase censorship resistance by making it more costly and difficult for any single validator to\u2026 \u2014 ethresearchbot (@ethresearchbot) February 23, 2024\n\nAs of today, a block proposer has unilateral authority over the set of transactions included during a 12-second slot. Thus, it can alter the list of transactions, making the second largest blockchain vulnerable to censorship.\n\nBy contrast, with two proposers, there are four possible outcomes for a block slot, ranging from both proposers successfully sharing their blocks to neither proposer presenting a block.\n\nThis variety impacts the blockchain's fork choice and requires adjustments to existing mechanisms like proposer boost. A malicious entity controlling both proposers in a slot could attempt to split the chain by manipulating the timing of block proposals, but the probability of this happening decreases exponentially as the number of required malicious proposers increases.\n\nAs a result, the cost of censorship increases with every new proposer active. However, due to the nature of Ethereum's slot, block and attestation design, the problem of switching toward multiple proposals needs further engineering and economical research.\n\nEthereum (ETH) validator design might change in 2024\n\nAlso, the researchers stressed that the problem of the significance of a potential upgrade to low-priority (\"censored\") transactions remains an open question.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, Ethereum (ETH) might see more validation design changes in 2024 post-Dencun upgrade.\n\nYesterday, on Feb. 23, it was announced that the problem of validator deposits was added to the agenda of the Electra hard fork expected in Q4, 2024-Q1, 2025."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAccording to insights from IntoTheBlock, a cluster of 1.38 million addresses acquired 1.33 million ETH, amounting to a staggering $3.9 billion, at an average price of $2,984. These investors are currently in the red, facing unrealized losses due to the recent price dip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe psychological impact of such a significant number of investors sitting at a loss cannot be understated. As Ethereum's price approaches their break-even point, these holders may be prompted to sell, either to recoup their initial investment or to prevent further losses, potentially leading to an increase in selling pressure.\n\nAdding to this narrative are substantial moves by Ethereum whales, which have historically been indicative of imminent price shifts. Recent activity includes the sale of 34,134 ETH, valued at $100.8 million, near the crucial $3,000 level. Notable transactions by individual whales, including addresses 0x7102 and 0x702a, involve significant amounts of ETH being moved to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and large platforms like Binance and Kraken. These transfers could be precursors to potential sell-offs, considering the sizeable amounts involved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt present, Ethereum's USD pair shows that after a remarkable rally, the price has settled near the $3,000 mark. While the aforementioned whale activities and the volume of \"at a loss\" investors could suggest a bearish outlook, the price of Ethereum remains resilient. The $2,984 level, where a bulk of purchases occurred, could serve as a soft support zone. A fall below this price might trigger a cascade of sell orders, resulting in further downward momentum.\n\nConversely, if Ethereum sustains above this level and reclaims ground above $3,000, it could alleviate the immediate selling pressure and potentially lead to a reversal, aiming for resistance levels at $3,100 and beyond. However, market participants should be wary of the large sell-offs by whales, which could dampen the bullish momentum."

It marks a supply change, halving the amount of new Bitcoin created each day.\n\nWith less supply and growing demand for Bitcoin due to new investment vehicles, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, analysts expect the halving to push prices higher.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade\n\nEthereum\u2019s upgrade, dubbed Dencun, is scheduled March 13, and aims to enhance scalability and reduce transaction fees on layer 2 platforms.\n\nDencun is considered Ethereum\u2019s most significant change since April 2023, when the so-called Shapella upgrade allowed stakers to withdraw staked Ether on the network.\n\nSpot Ethereum ETF approval\n\nThe potential US approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is the final catalyst JPMorgan cites.\n\nAfter more than $10 billion poured into Bitcoin ETFs following their approval last month, Ethereum is also positioned to attract investors.\n\nBlackRock is among fund giants hoping to win a green light for a spot Ethereum ETF, following its hugely popular entry into a Bitcoin version.\n\nSome say Ethereum may even outperform Bitcoin if the ETFs win a regulatory nod, given that it\u2019s more levered to economic activity in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin fell 0.6% to $51,200 on Friday.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price is leading markets into weekend mode where trading volumes are low and, therefore, the price becomes susceptible to volatility. With altcoins awaiting the BTC cue, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices appear to have taken a hint.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC likely to correct to $50,000 soon\n\nBitcoin, altcoins, stablecoins FAQs What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. What are altcoins? Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of it. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. What is Bitcoin Dominance? Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.\n\nBitcoin may have just chosen a directional bias\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has recorded a steady series of lower highs and lower lows over the past four days, suggesting a clear directional bias. However, this is subject for confirmation considering that the $50,638 support level continues to hold. A break and close below it would confirm the continuation of the downtrend, likely sending BTC to $50,000.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already executed a selling signal by crossing below the signal line (yellow band). This is reinforced by the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO), which are steadily edging toward the midline.\n\nIn addition, based on the Mean Reversion Channel (MRC) indicator principle that holds that price tends to return to its average over time, the market is leaning to the downside.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if buyer momentum increases, Bitcoin price could push north, escaping the market range above $52,829. In a highly bullish case, BTC could shatter the range high at $52,985 before confronting the $53,000 psychological level. A decisive candlestick close above this level would clear the path for an extended move north.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price eyes $48,000 as European Central Bank tears down at BTC after spot ETF approval\n\nEthereum price repels $3,000\n\nAfter a rejection from the $3,000 psychological level, Ethereum price is trading within the ascending parallel channel. However, it risks an extended fall following the execution of a selling signal on the RSI. With the weekend setting in, low trading volumes and the resultant volatility could see ETH retest the $2,874 support. In a dire case, the slump could send the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) token to the $2,770 support confluence between the horizontal line and the midline of the channel.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, with the bulls still maintaining a presence in the BTC market, seen with the large volumes of green histogram bars of the AO, Ethereum price could overcome the $3,000 milestone, or in a highly bullish case, clear the range high of $3,036 to tag the $3,200 milestone.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price risks decline as increasing exchange supply raises chances of profit taking\n\nRipple price eyes $0.5000\n\nRipple (XRP) price has recorded a series of lower highs and lower lows over the past four days after a rejection from the upper boundary of the descending parallel channel. After crossing below the signal line, the RSI is below 50, showing the market is leaning to the downside. The red histogram bars of the AO accentuate this and add credence to the bearish thesis. In a dire case, Ripple price could roll over to the $0.4734 support floor.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, enhanced buyer momentum could send Ripple price above resistance stemming from the upper boundary of the channel, with a decisive candlestick close above it setting the pace for an extension to $0.6000. Such a move would constitute a 12% climb above current levels.\n\nAlso Read: XRP price plunges as Kraken cites SEC v. Ripple lawsuit in its legal battle against the regulator"

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Solana? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The crypto ecosystem has gone through several dramatic changes in the past few years. In 2020 and 2021, the industry was driven by hype and speculation only to crash in 2022 and early 2023. There was no better example of this hype cycle than Solana (CRYPTO: SOL).\n\nIt peaked at more than $250 per token and dropped below $10 per coin after the collapse of FTX. But this continues to be one of the lowest-cost and highest-throughput blockchains in the crypto ecosystem, and if you think the innovation and disruption of crypto is from utility and not just speculation, this is still a cryptocurrency to hold long term.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat people do in crypto matters\n\nThe health of a blockchain can be seen in the activity of developers and users. This can be judged by developer activity. Solana reports 2,500 to 3,000 developers consistently, short of only Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) at about 6,000 developers.\n\nOn the user side, transactions per second is a great gauge of how much activity there is on a blockchain. Solana averages between 3,000 and 4,000 transactions per second compared to a blockchain like Ethereum at around 13 transactions per second.\n\nThese two factors together will give you an idea of the health of the blockchain itself. If developers are building it and users are using it, the blockchain has a likely chance of growing in the future.\n\nETFs and the future of crypto investing\n\nWe have seen billions of dollars flow into the crypto industry over the past month after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This led to speculation that Ethereum will be the next to get an ETF and more cryptocurrencies may follow.\n\nSolana could get an ETF if Ethereum is approved. It has similar characteristics and smart contracts to Ethereum and has strong institutional and consumer interest.\n\nBut I don't think it's likely Solana will hold a place like Bitcoin in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is more like digital gold that investors simply want to hold long term, whereas Solana is more of a utility coin for the blockchain. But there could be buyers for both kinds of assets.\n\nSolana's uncertainty\n\nThe one downside of Solana is the coin itself is not as important to the ecosystem as it is to something like the Ethereum blockchain. Yes, there's a proof-of-stake element to Solana, but a lot of transactions simply happened with USDC stablecoin as the medium of exchange.\n\nThe future of Solana may be driven by a USDC-denominated token or some other fiat-backed token, and not the Solano cryptocurrency that we see today. This may mean less upside with the cryptocurrency itself, despite being the native coin to the blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven all of these factors, I think the biggest reason to be bullish on Solana long term is the fact that this is where innovation development and transactions are taking place on the blockchain today. There's more activity and innovation on Solana than almost any other blockchain. And activity and USDC we are using the Solana blockchain for normal financial transactions without even knowing it in the future.

        "title": "Crypto Market Price Analysis Today: Ethereum (ETH), SingularityNET (AGIX), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), CELO, COTI - Blockchain Reporter",
        "content": "[ccpw id=60415] is facing significant resistance around the $52,000 mark, which may signal an upcoming short-term pullback. The market witnessed a withdrawal of approximately $36 million from Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on February 21, as reported by sources like BitMEX Research. However, this trend reversed on February 22, with the ETFs experiencing net inflows of nearly $251 million.\n\nMarket analysts, including the well-known trader and analyst Rekt Capital, suggest that the market might be preparing for a correction ahead of Bitcoin\u2019s halving event in April. Drawing parallels to the bull markets of 2016 and 2020, Rekt Capital speculates that a pattern of a pre-halving dip followed by a post-halving accumulation phase could unfold. The reluctance of Bitcoin to extend its upward trajectory has triggered some investors to cash in profits on certain altcoins. Such corrective actions are deemed beneficial for the market\u2019s long-term stability as they weed out weaker participants, thereby providing opportunities for more committed investors to buy in at lower prices.\n\nWhat are the key support levels that we should keep an eye on for Ethereum and other leading altcoins? We will dive into the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to discover more.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Price Analysis\n\n[ccpw id=60480] attempted to breach the significant $3,000 resistance level but encountered strong opposition from sellers. Though the price declined toward $2,900, it recovered from the low. Currently, ETH price is trading at $2,973, surging over 1.2% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe market is witnessing efforts by sellers to initiate a pullback towards the breakout point of $2,700. This level is crucial, especially since it\u2019s in close proximity to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 4-hour price chart.\n\nA vigorous rebound from $2,700 would suggest that the bulls have successfully converted this level into a support zone, setting the stage for another push to overcome the $3,000 barrier. A breakthrough could send the ETH/USDT trading pair towards the $3,100-$3,300 zone.\n\nOn the flip side, for the bears to undermine the bullish momentum, they would need to consistently drive and keep the price below $2,700. Should this occur, the pair could potentially fall below moving averages. A decline to such depths might send the ETH price toward $2,400.\n\nSingularityNET (AGIX) Price Analysis\n\nAGIX price continued its upward trend after surpassing the $0.6 resistance, setting its sights on the $1 mark as the next upward milestone. However, bears attempted to hinder progress at $0.85.\n\nIf the bulls manage to hold their position near this level without significant losses, it suggests strong buying interest on minor pullbacks, enhancing the likelihood of an advance to $1.\n\nOn the downside, the initial support is found at 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.68, followed by $0.6. Should these support levels fail to sustain, the correction might extend to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (SMA) at $0.48. Holding above this crucial threshold is vital for the bulls, as a breach could indicate a shift in the prevailing trend.\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR) Price Analysis\n\nThe extended lower shadow of the NEAR candlestick indicates that investors continue to see any drops to the Fib levels as an opportunity to buy. As a result, NEAR price continued breaking above resistance lines and is now nearing the ascending line.\n\nInvestors are making efforts to keep the price over the immediate resistance level of $3.8. Should they succeed, the NEAR/USDT trading pair might surge to the crucial resistance point at $4.6. At this juncture, a fierce contest is anticipated between buyers and sellers. However, if the buyers come out on top, the price is likely to climb to $6 next.\n\nConversely, a sharp decline from $3.8 would show that the sellers are effectively protecting this threshold. A fall below the 20-day EMA would indicate a decline in buying pressure.\n\nCelo Price Analysis\n\nSellers attempted to push Celo price back within the symmetrical triangle pattern, but buyers aggressively defended the level. As a result, the price jumped above $0.88; however, bears defended that level. As of writing, CELO price trades at $0.825, surging over 5.7% from yesterday\u2019s rate.\n\nThe 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.79 is showing signs of a gradual increase, and with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing above 62, it suggests that buyers are gearing up for a rally. A successful move past the $0.88 mark could send the CELO/USDT pair toward the resistance zone of $0.9 to $1.\n\nHowever, this bullish scenario could be challenged if the price declines and falls below the moving averages, signaling that sellers are capitalizing on every slight upward movement. A breach below $0.76 could further amplify selling pressure.\n\nCoti Price Analysis\n\nCOTI has experienced a slight downturn within an upward trend, indicating that short-term traders might be cashing in their profits. However, buyers are focused on extending the uptrend above $0.18.\n\nThe upward trajectory is supported by a climbing 20-day EMA (at $0.11) and an RSI that is approaching overbought conditions, signaling that the market momentum is still predominantly bullish. A jump in price and a subsequent climb above $0.18 would confirm that the upward trend is continuing. Following this, the COTI/USDT pair might aim for a target of $0.35.\n\nConversely, should the price decline further and fall below the 20-day EMA, a level that could potentially entice buyers. However, if selling pressure outweighs buying interest, the pair might drop to the consolidated zone of $0.1."

        "content": "One of the co-founders of the video game Axie Infinity and the related Ronin Network had nearly $10 million in cryptocurrency stolen from personal accounts.\n\nReports said wallets belonging to Jeff \u201cJihoz\u201d Zirlin were hacked to the tune of 3,248 ethereum coins, or about $9.7 million. Zirlin confirmed on social media late Thursday that two of his accounts were compromised.\n\n\u201cThe attack is limited to my personal accounts, and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain\u201d or Axie Infinity operator Sky Mavis, Zirlin said. Another Ronin Network co-founder, Aleksander Larsen, echoed those comments.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the intruders got access to Zirlin\u2019s wallets.\n\nThe Ronin Network underpins Axie Infinity, which has a play-to-earn economy based on ethereum. It\u2019s particularly popular in Southeast Asia. Hackers stole $600 million in cryptocurrency from the system in March 2022 \u2014 an attack that U.S. prosecutors subsequently attributed to Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed cybercrime operation.\n\nOn Friday, analysts traced the funds stolen from Zirlin\u2019s accounts to activity on Tornado Cash, a mixer designed to hide the source of cryptocurrency. Lazarus used the mixer to launder funds from the 2022 hack, according to the U.S. government, which separately sanctioned Tornado Cash.\n\nBlockchain investigator PeckShield told the publication Cointelegraph that the theft was indeed a \u201cwallet compromise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure everyone that we have strict security measures in place for all chain related activities\u201d for Ronin, Zirlin said."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDogecoin is showing a gleam of technical optimism. The recent crossing of the 100-day and 50-day EMAs is a small version of the much celebrated 50-200 EMA golden cross, often regarded as one of the most bullish signals in technical analysis.\n\nThis mini golden cross, while not as definitive as the classic version, still gives traders a reason to pay attention. Historically, such crosses have been precursors to potential uptrends. For Dogecoin, the price has been oscillating around this crossover region, suggesting a tug-of-war between bears and bulls.\n\nDOGE/USDT Chart by TradingView\n\nDogecoin's current support level can be spotted around the $0.077 mark, which aligns with the 100-day EMA. Should this level hold, it could act as a springboard, reinforcing the bullish sentiment brought about by the EMA crossover. On the flip side, if this support falters, we might see a dip toward the $0.070 threshold, where previous market activities have shown interest.\n\nIf Dogecoin can capitalize on this mini golden cross, the next target would be to test the resistance at $0.088. A break above this level with sustained volume could set the stage for a continued upward trajectory, with the $0.10 psychological barrier as the next significant milestone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum finally scores\n\nEthereum has achieved a significant milestone by breaking through the $3,000 price barrier, a bullish signal that many investors have anticipated for the last few months.\n\nThe ascent to $3,000 marks a key psychological and technical level for Ethereum. This breakthrough is supported by a robust volume profile, suggesting that the move is backed by substantial market interest.\n\nLocal support levels now adjust to this new paradigm, with previous resistance around $2,800 potentially becoming a new support zone. Should ETH maintain its position above this level, it would confirm the strength of the current trend and possibly establish a foundation for further gains.\n\nLooking at the potential for a rally continuation from the current levels, the momentum appears strong. Investors and traders will now be eyeing the next resistance levels, which could be around the $3,200 to $3,300 range, where ETH may face a test. A consolidation above $3,000 could provide the springboard needed to challenge these higher thresholds.\n\nIn a bullish scenario, if Ethereum manages to sustain its current levels and market sentiment remains positive, there is a possibility of continued growth, potentially targeting the all-time highs seen previously. The RSI and volume will be key indicators to watch for sustaining buying pressure.\n\nSolana still losing\n\nSolana is currently exhibiting bearish tendencies. A close look at SOL's price trajectory reveals it is navigating through a potentially critical phase.\n\nAs of now, SOL is manifesting a downtrend within a bearish channel pattern. The price has recently faced resistance at the upper trend line of this channel, suggesting a possible continuation of bearish momentum. Key support levels to watch include the psychological round number at $100, followed by a more established support at around $90 which, if broken, could lead to a further slide.\n\nIf SOL fails to hold the $100 level, we could witness a steeper decline, with the next substantial support level at $90. A break below this could potentially open a path toward the $80 mark, especially if broader market sentiment remains negative.\n\nA bullish reversal could occur if SOL finds solid footing at the current support levels. For a shift in trend, SOL would need to break out of the descending channel, pushing past the immediate resistance near $110. This could indicate short-term bearish exhaustion and potentially signal the start of a recovery phase, targeting subsequent resistance levels at $120 and above."

        "content": "The first quarter of 2024 is proving to be an exciting era for crypto investors. While attention was majorly on Bitcoin in Q4 last year and in early January, interest has been gradually shifting to Ethereum and the altcoin market in general. The ETH/BTC chart analysis takes into account the changing dynamics, that could result in an unparalleled altcoin season.\n\nETH/BTC Chart Analysis: Ethereum Fires Up As Bitcoin Stalls\n\nThe ETH/BTC trading pair with a value of $0.0574 holds above an important support area highlighted by the 0.382 Fibonacci ratio around $0.0573. Slightly below the same demand zone is the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (the blue line on the chart).\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) neutral but sliding toward the midline and the oversold region, ETH/USD could push harder on the above support area. Holding firmly above the 0.382 Fibo would make Ethereum stronger, insinuating a larger breakout in ETH price. Ethereum will weaken against Bitcoin if the same support caves.\n\nThe technical structure on the daily chart is no different, with the ETH/USD pair expected to bounce off the 0.382 Fibonacci support level. A stronger Bitcoin in January butchered the demand area, causing a flash drop to $0.051, underscoring the importance of controlling sell-side pressure.\n\nThe upcoming Dencun upgrade is likely the secret weapon Ethereum bulls have against Bitcoin. This upgrade has many benefits for Ethereum as a network and its underlying layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon.\n\nAssessing ETH/USD Weekly Technical Structure\n\nSeveral key levels would determine where the ETH/BTC pair heads in the coming days or weeks. For starters, support highlighted by the green band on the weekly chart has been tested more than once \u2014 in May, in Dec/Jan, and in February.\n\nThat said, there is a high chance ETH/USD will rebound from the green-colored support area for another targeted attempt at the trend line resistance from September last year. Ethereum will emerge extremely bullish if this resistance is broken, paving the way for widespread rallies in the altcoin market.\n\nA potential spot Ethereum ETF is another key factor to keep in mind while trading the ETH/BTC pair, especially long-term. Experts anticipate the same bullish outlook for Ethereum if the SEC greenlights the products that allow traditional investors to seek exposure to ETH on the stock market without having to worry about the complexities of crypto including exchanges and storage.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin halving due in April may turn the tables around, bolstering BTC price rally toward the end of the year and subsequently in 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nXRP\u2019s popularity has surged, outperforming ETH in Google searches in several countries.\n\nRipple\u2019s lawsuit outcome and events like the Bitcoin halving could further boost XRP\u2019s prominence and value.\n\nJapan and Many More\n\nDespite the lengthy lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the entity\u2019s native token \u2013 XRP \u2013 remains among the trendiest cryptocurrencies. Its popularity rose significantly last year when Ripple secured three vital (yet partial) court victories against its opponent.\n\nAccording to most recent trends, XRP has even surpassed Ethereum (ETH) in Google searches in certain countries (over the past month). Japan, the Philippines, and South Africa are the top 3 nations where Ripple\u2019s coin has dwarfed its. XRP searches have also been on the rise in Finland, Malaysia, and Indonesia, albeit in a more modest fashion.\n\nEthereum remains more popular in some leading European economies, including France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, and others.\n\nA few months ago, Solana briefly flipped ETH in terms of Google searches. The trend coincided with SOL\u2019s rapid price increase, which skyrocketed by approximately 1,000% between the beginning of last year and New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nCan XRP Progress Even More?\n\nSome could argue that Ripple\u2019s coin might surge in popularity even more if its price explodes in the following months. The crypto space is rammed with analysts who have recently predicted colossal surges for the coin.\n\nSeveral important factors and upcoming developments hint that such an ascend is not out of the cards. Perhaps the most obvious one is the outcome of the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, which is nearing a grand trial (scheduled on April 23).\n\nA decisive win for the company might trigger huge excitement and cause a bull run for XRP and the entire market. On the other hand, the opposite scenario could pause the advancement of the industry.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is worth mentioning, too. The event occurs approximately every four years and reduces the rate at which new BTC is mined. Historically, it has been followed by a massive crypto bull run, which might positively impact the XRP price.\n\nThose willing to explore additional factors that could play a role, feel free to take a look at our dedicated video below:"

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase has formally asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its current Ethereum Trust product into a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move comes after a handful of prominent Wall Street titans, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have filed paperwork for Ethereum ETFs.\n\nEther price could explode to unfathomable heights if the SEC allows the listing of the asset\u2019s spot ETFs on U.S. exchanges.\n\nSpot ETH ETFs Should Be Approved\n\nCoinbase, which is the Grayscale Ethereum Trust\u2019s crypto custodian, has stood firmly behind the asset manager in its application to introduce a spot ETH ETF.\n\nIn a 27-page letter shared by Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal on Thursday, the exchange explained several reasons why the Securities and Exchange Commission should approve an ether-based spot ETF.\n\nKey to Coinbase\u2019s argument is the categorization of ether as a commodity, not a security, a distinction crucial for legal compliance and market perception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe market has long understood that ETH is not a security,\u201d Coinbase wrote in the letter. \u201cSenior officials of the Commission have publicly said as much on several occasions over the past six years, and neither the Commission nor its staff has disavowed this position, even after the merge.\u201d\n\nCoinbase then praised Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, stating that the model effectively mitigates risks of fraud and manipulation, leading to a more robust and reliable platform. This remark comes amid growing concerns over concentration risks within the Ethereum network, especially regarding spot ETH ETFs that include staking options.\n\nThe economics show that ETH is as resilient as BTC in satisfying the Commission's standard for ETP approvals. 4/6 pic.twitter.com/wDsnMFGZhL \u2014 paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) February 21, 2024\n\nThe exchange also highlighted ETH\u2019s market depth, liquidity, and tight spreads as evidence of a mature and efficient market. Furthermore, Coinbase points to its comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which would allow it to monitor ETH futures to safeguard against fraudulent and manipulative practices in the Ethereum market.\n\nFinally, ETH futures ETFs are similar products to spot market ether funds, so it would be arbitrary for the SEC to grant approval to one but not the other, given their close correlation, Coinbase argued.\n\nSpot ETF Can Fuel ETH Rally\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs in mid-January marked a watershed moment for the crypto industry, spurring the price of BTC to break the $50,000 hurdle in February for the first time since 2021.\n\nEther, the market\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency also managed to rise through the $3,000 mark, buoyed by Bitcoin\u2019s strong upward momentum.\n\nJust like with spot Bitcoin ETFs, these regulated investment products are anticipated to boost ether\u2019s institutional appeal \u2014 driving demand for ETH. If retail appetite maintains the momentum while institutions swarm in, ETH could soar past $3,500. If this happens, ether could then quickly find itself returning to its November 2021 lifetime peak of $4,878."

        "title": "Why Andreessen Horowitz is betting $100 million on crypto restaking - Fortune",
        "content": "Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a.k.a. a16z, has announced that it\u2019s investing $100 million into EigenLayer, a startup that facilitates crypto restaking.\n\nSo what actually is restaking? It\u2019s a process that involves repurposing ETH tokens that are deposited, or staked, as a means of securing the main Ethereum blockchain. When a validator stakes tokens, it signifies a commitment to the network\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already put up some economic capital and promise in Ethereum that they will not violate the governance of the protocol, otherwise they lose their stake in what it does,\u201d founder Sreeram Kannan, a former University of Washington professor, explained to Fortune. \u201cEigenLayer provides a universal, decentralized, validation marketplace.\u201d\n\nEigenLayer, founded in 2021, provides a mechanism for developers to deploy protocols atop Ethereum\u2019s existing node-operator infrastructure, which offers significantly more flexibility, Kannan adds. \u201cThat is why I think Andreessen took a bet on us.\u201d\n\nAli Yahya, an a16z general partner, wrote in a company blog post, in part: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Sreeram and the whole team on building a platform that unlocks a new dimension of open innovation on top of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nSilicon Valley stalwart a16z\u2019s recent $4.5 billion crypto-fund raise made a splash in the sector, perhaps hinting at a reversal in what\u2019s been diminishing interest in Web3-related venture capital outlays. VC funding for crypto had been declining since the start of 2022, although the final quarter of 2023 saw a 2.3% uptick, according to a report by PitchBook, a private market data analysis provider: \u201cAfter six straight quarters of decline, an uptick in funding, albeit a tiny percentage, could present welcome news for startups in the coming quarters.\u201d\n\nA potential roadblock for EigenLayer could come via Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who told crypto firms last March that digital assets using staking protocols could be considered securities under federal law, The Block reported.\n\nThe investing public is anticipating a return on these \u201cproof-of-stake tokens, and getting 2%, 4%, 18% returns,\u201d Gensler said at the time. \u201cI would just suggest that each of these token operators \u2026 seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries.\u201d\n\nBut Kannan said that he\u2019s not too concerned with such headwinds\u2014\u201cWe are not anywhere in the same zone\u201d\u2014and that his firm is simply removing the need for new protocols to create additional staking tokens altogether, instead leaning on already-existing economic commitments made to Ethereum.\n\n\u201cIt helps many more developers participate in the crypto economy, without each of them having to worry about how to create a new decentralized economy around it,\u201d he says."

Buying $SMOG on Ethereum qualifies investors to stake their tokens and earn 42% APY. In addition, investors who buy $SMOG on Ethereum will get a 10% discount and also qualify for the upcoming airdrops.\n\nSo, it pays to buy $SMOG on Ethereum right now. We\u2019ll explain how to buy Smog.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Set Up a Crypto Wallet\n\nInvestors will need a crypto wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens. Reliable, free options include MetaMask and Trust Wallet. MetaMask can be installed on a mobile device or browser.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Add Funds to Wallet\n\nInvestors will need to swap $ETH or $USDT to purchase $SMOG tokens on Ethereum. Purchase any of these tokens from a centralized crypto exchange like MEXC, Binance, or Coinbase.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Connect to $SMOG Sale\n\nTo buy $SMOG on Ethereum, visit the project\u2019s Ethereum token sale site.

When ready, click \u2018Buy for 42% APY\u2019 to purchase $SMOG tokens.\n\nInvestors\u2019 newly purchased $SMOG will be staked automatically and begin earning 42% APY. Staked tokens are locked for 90 days before they are released to investors\u2019 wallets.\n\nVisit Smog\n\nHow to Buy $SMOG on Solana\n\n$SMOG has already launched on decentralized exchanges on Solana, so investors can purchase $SMOG directly from these DEXs. The Smog team recommends using Birdeye, but alternative DEXs like Raydium and Jupiter also work.\n\nTo buy $SMOG on Solana, investors will need a crypto wallet with $SOL, $USDT, or $BONK. Visit a DEX and connect a wallet, then search for the $SMOG/$SOL or $SMOG/$USDT trading pair. Enter the amount of $SOL or $USDT to swap, then execute the order to purchase $SMOG. Tokens will be transferred to the crypto wallet immediately.\n\nWhat is Smog?\n\nSmog is a top meme coin that features a fire-breathing dragon that rules over a mythical land. It encourages investors to fill their bags and guard their treasure by buying and holding onto $SMOG tokens.\n\nSmog initially launched on the Solana blockchain with a fair launch on the Raydium DEX. That means it didn\u2019t hold a presale like many other meme coins have.\n\nThe launch saw enormous success, with $SMOG gaining more than 4,600% in its first 2 weeks after launch. According to DEXTools, $SMOG now has a market cap of more than $90 million and is owned by more than 26,000 investors.\n\nSmog may have launched at just the right time. Solana meme coins have been on a massive tear, driving up engagement across the Solana ecosystem and driving renewed development on Solana.\n\nNow, Smog is also planning a launch on Ethereum. The Ethereum launch will follow a more traditional meme coin presale but without a cap on the number of $SMOG tokens that can be sold.\n\nSmog Airdrops\n\nSmog is planning to reward early investors on Solana and Ethereum with an upcoming crypto airdrop of additional $SMOG tokens. 35% of the token supply has been set aside for airdrops.\n\nThe team behind Smog has also hinted in its roadmap that more airdrops could happen in the future.\n\nAll token holders have to do to qualify for the first airdrop is to buy and hold $SMOG before an unspecified cutoff date. The longer users hold $SMOG, the more tokens they stand to earn in the airdrop.\n\nSmog Staking Rewards\n\nInvestors who buy $SMOG on Ethereum can stake their tokens and earn rewards of 42% APY. That\u2019s an impressive return for a project that\u2019s already demonstrated it has explosive potential and a large community behind it.\n\nOn top of that, Smog is offering a 10% discount on $SMOG purchases on Ethereum for a limited time. The discounted price and staking rewards are not available to investors who buy $SMOG on Solana.\n\nSmog Tokenomics\n\nSmog has a total supply of 1.4 billion tokens, which will be distributed across the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems based on demand on each of these blockchains.\n\n50% of the token supply is allocated for marketing efforts, and another 35% is set aside for airdrop rewards. The remaining 15% of tokens are reserved for providing liquidity for exchange launches.\n\nRoadmap\n\nSmog\u2019s roadmap is split into 3 phases.\n\nPhase 1 is complete. It included creating the Smog token and website, launching social channels, and laying the foundations for the $SMOG token airdrop.\n\nIt included creating the Smog token and website, launching social channels, and laying the foundations for the $SMOG token airdrop.

        "content": "News: Reddit has officially filed a prospectus document for its upcoming initial public offering (IPO) with the US SEC, with the dual intention of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and investing excess funds in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nLet\u2019s see below all the details.\n\nReddit reveals investment plans in Bitcoin and Ethereum: news on the IPO project\n\nAs anticipated, Reddit has stated that it will allocate excess funds to investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum, a commitment reiterated in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn the document, Reddit exposes its activity of holding cryptocurrencies and exploring the blockchain technology, emphasizing the potential legal, tax, and regulatory risks associated with such operations.\n\nThe filing also reveals that Reddit has acquired Ether and Matic as payment methods for the sale of virtual goods, highlighting the intention to continue such practices.\n\nThe company specifies that these digital assets are acquired for internal use, intended for product and engineering teams.\n\nReddit clarifies that as of December 31, 2023, its holding of digital assets was limited to Bitcoin and Ether for treasury purposes, following a policy that requires approval from the board of directors for any investment in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe document specifies that investments in cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies that enjoy positive recognition from regulatory authorities.\n\nThe deposit highlights Reddit\u2019s adherence to the growing trend of adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, while also emphasizing the uncertainty about their long-term continuity in terms of adoption by consumers and businesses.\n\nDespite the document not providing details on the specific amount of digital assets held by Reddit, it seems that the company has no intention of slowing down its investments in cryptocurrencies, especially in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States at the beginning of 2024 seems to further strengthen Reddit\u2019s position in this sector.\n\nIt was also revealed in 2023 that the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, had purchased 50,000 ETH in 2014, an investment that has seen a significant increase in value over time.\n\nFiling the S-1 form for the IPO\n\nOn Thursday, Reddit officially filed its initial public offering (IPO) prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), planning to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \u201cRDDT\u201d.\n\nThe social media company had initially confidentially filed a draft registration statement at the end of 2021, during a period marked by a wave of other IPOs.\n\nHowever, the market for public listings has undergone a significant contraction, dropping from 1,035 IPOs in 2021 to 181 in 2022 and 154 in 2023.\n\nIn its S-1 form, Reddit disclosed an annual revenue of $804 million in the last year of its IPO, marking a 21% increase compared to the previous year.\n\nHowever, despite these positive results, the company continues to report a net loss of 90.8 million dollars in 2023, highlighting the challenges on the road to profitability.\n\nReddit, which relies mainly on advertising sales for revenue, has emphasized the vast market opportunity in digital advertising, estimating a value of 1 trillion dollars (excluding China and Russia).\n\nIt is expected that this sector will grow at a compound annual rate of 8%, reaching $1.4 trillion in 2027, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence."

        "title": "Block gained $207M on its Bitcoin Holdings and Ethereum Spot-Exchange Traded Fund - Tekedia",
        "content": "In its fourth-quarter earnings report released recently, fintech company Block reported a remarkable remeasurement gain of $207 million on its bitcoin holdings. As of December 31, 2023, Block held approximately 8,038 BTC for investment purposes with a fair value of $340 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings report highlighted a significant increase in bitcoin revenue, totaling $2.52 billion, representing a 37% year-over-year rise. This growth was driven by both an increase in the average market price of bitcoin and the price appreciation of Block\u2019s bitcoin inventory during the quarter.\n\nBlock\u2019s subsidiary, Cash App, played a crucial role in these gains. The platform generated a gross profit of $66 million on bitcoin sales last quarter, representing an impressive 90% increase year over year. The total sale amount of bitcoin sold to customers\u2014which Block recognizes as bitcoin revenue\u2014was $2.52 billion.\n\nShares of Block (NASDAQ: SQ) surged by 13% in after-hours trading, reaching $76. Overall, Block reported that its gross profit grew by 22% yearly, reaching an impressive total of $2.03 billion. Square, another subsidiary of Block, generated a gross profit of $828 million (up 18% year over year), while Cash App contributed $1.18 billion (up 25% year over year) to the company\u2019s overall performance. In summary, Block\u2019s strategic investment in bitcoin has paid off significantly, positioning the company as a major player in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nEther spot-exchange traded funds (ETFs) may increase institutional investment and power the world\u2019s most-used blockchain, but they are unlikely to create euphoric price surges, according to some market observers. While interest in ether bets has risen significantly, an ETF could create sustained growth rather than explosive growth in the ether market.\n\nLast week, Ethereum\u2019s native token crossed the $3,000 mark for the first time since April 2022, rising 15% in a week and beating bitcoin\u2019s relatively modest 8% rally in the same period. Crypto circles on social application X expect such price action to continue after the expected issuance of ether ETFs later this year. The narrative is that these inflows could later find their way to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nHowever, some believe an ETF could create sustained, rather than explosive, growth in the ether market. Jag Kooners, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, stated that \u201cEthereum ETFs won\u2019t cause bubbles.\u201d He further explained that institutional investment through an ETF could stabilize the Ethereum market, similar to what has been observed with bitcoin and gold ETFs, fostering sustained growth.\n\nKooners also highlighted that Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 solutions which enhance scalability by enabling faster, cheaper transactions outside the main blockchain, play a role in fostering growth. Unlike bitcoin\u2019s security focus, Ethereum\u2019s L2 solutions prioritize rapid expansion, potentially attracting institutional investment and broadening application scope.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s status as a macroeconomic asset has made it increasingly sensitive to global economic developments. As institutional participation in Bitcoin grows, adverse macro events can impact its price significantly.\n\nRecently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern about high inflation, leading to expectations of faster stimulus unwinding. Additionally, Evergrande\u2019s debt crisis and IMF warnings have added to market jitters. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s deflationary asset credentials and its transition to ETH 2.0 have helped it remain relatively resilient.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that an ether ETF still faces regulatory headwinds. The classification of ether as a security or commodity remains a key hurdle despite ongoing regulatory discussions. Some traditional finance firms estimate a 50% chance of an ether ETF approval by May 2024 with ether considered the \u201conly digital asset other than bitcoin\u201d to get spot ETF approval in the U.S. Several companies have submitted applications.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"
