        "title": "Ethereum Insider Ready For Battle: ETH Founders' Fraud Proof Coming In 4-5 Days | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Steven Nerayoff, one of the earliest advisors for Ethereum, has had various debates and discussions concerning Ethereum in the past few weeks. The former lawyer for the crypto firm has never wavered from his position that Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, the co-founders of Ethereum, engaged in fraudulent activity during the early days of the network and that the SEC was corrupt in its dealings with Ethereum.\n\nWhile speaking in a Space hosted on social media platform X, Nerayoff revealed he has recorded proof that could heavily implicate Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nFormer Ethereum Advisor Claims to Have Proof of Fraud\n\nNerayoff has always asserted that the extent of fraud in the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s early days surpasses the scale of the FTX scandal, which led to the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy. This saga has continued in this high-stakes battle over the transparency and decentralization of one of crypto\u2019s largest ecosystems.\n\nNerayoff had been initially talking with other speakers on the podcast about the SEC\u2019s plan to ultimately decide who and what becomes a security in the crypto industry before switching topics to the ETHGate scandal.\n\nAccording to Nerayoff, the Ethereum Foundation had run into troubles in 2015 as it actually looked like it was going under. Buterin reportedly ran to Nerayoff for help to save and restructure the foundation, as he had created the utility token and ICO for ETH.\n\nNerayoff mentioned this conversation with Vitalik ran up to three hours, and he had it recorded, and it is ready to be released as a free NFT and a transcript in the next four to five days.\n\n\u201cSo he asked me to restructure the entire Ethereum Foundation to save it and I\u2019ve got the whole thing recorded. I\u2019m going to drop it. We\u2019re doing it as an NFT. It\u2019s free, but everybody can have it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ethereum former advisor also talked about how the SEC basically gave a free pass to Ethereum amidst the ETH Gate scandal. The SEC had initially considered ETH\u2019s utility token as a security before former director Will Hinman gave a speech noting that BTC and ETH were decentralized and not securities. On the other hand, the SEC went after Ripple and XRP on claims of centralization.\n\nHowever, Nerayoff is of the notion that ETH was centralized when the speech was made, and neither Joe Lubin nor Vitalik Buterin could boast of its decentralization at that point. Furthermore, Nerayoff noted that there was internal documentation at that point that indicated that the network hadn\u2019t met the requirements in order for it to be decentralized.\n\nThis internal documentation was reportedly only accessible by Nerayoff, prompting regulators to go after him on charges of extortion. Prosecutors have since dropped these charges, but Nerayoff claims it was all a setup. He also claimed the SEC, FBI, and the DOJ fabricated the evidence, and it was all done in a bid to take him out.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s accusations have been explosive and threaten to shake investor confidence in Ethereum. Many members of the XRP community have also questioned the SEC\u2019s inconsistencies.\n\nNerayoff failed to go into details of his conversation with Buterin, and he said he wasn\u2019t going to mention which particular laws were broken. Still, he did insinuate that it contained proof that Ethereum\u2019s early founders themselves did not believe the network was decentralized during its launch.\n\nThe release of Nerayoff\u2019s recording could spur legal action against Buterin and other ETH founders. When asked if his recorded evidence could lead to criminal charges for Buterin and Lubin, Nerayoff said that\u2019s up to the SEC and the DOJ.\n\nETH bulls still holding price steady above $2,000 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Cryptopolitan, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "What Is the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade? - Binance Academy",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade aims to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency within the Ethereum network, introducing the concept of proto-danksharding.\n\nDanksharding represents the final phase of the Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) upgrade that enhances data management and transaction processing.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade is designed to bring faster transaction processing times, reduced transaction costs, and optimized data management. Potential risks include impacts on existing smart contracts and the integration of new data storage techniques.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade was initially planned to go live in October 2023 but was later delayed to the first half of 2024. It went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) and the introduction of sharding are vital components of its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. PoS reduces energy consumption by replacing miners with validators, who are selected to create new blocks based on the amount of ETH they stake.\n\nMeanwhile, sharding increases transaction speed by partitioning the Ethereum network into smaller pieces (shards), with each capable of independently processing transactions and smart contracts. The shift from PoW to PoS enables secure and efficient sharding by randomly assigning validators to specific shards, preventing manipulation and enhancing performance.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade represents an important advancement in the Ethereum blockchain, aimed at fortifying the network's scalability, security, and overall efficiency. This upgrade introduces the concept of proto-danksharding, an important step toward optimizing data management and enhancing transaction affordability within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nBy leveraging innovative data storage techniques, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade is poised to revolutionize the way the network processes transactions, paving the way for a more accessible and seamless user experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade (also known as the \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d upgrade) is a concerted effort by Ethereum to bolster its infrastructure and address unresolved issues after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade is based on four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs): EIP-4844, EIP-1153, EIP-4788, and EIP-6780. Together, the implementation of these EIPs can provide many benefits, including improved scalability, enhanced data storage and availability, and reduced transaction costs.\n\nWith a primary focus on optimizing the execution layer (Layer 1), the Cancun upgrade prepares the network for the future implementation of full data sharding, a vital component in Ethereum's long-term development strategy.\n\nSharding refers to splitting a blockchain database into smaller portions, called shards, for higher efficiency, and the Cancun upgrade introduces a specific type of sharding known as proto-danksharding (discussed below).\n\nThe goal of the Cancun upgrade is to increase the network\u2019s transactions per second (TPS), aligning with Ethereum's roadmap's \"Surge\" phase, aiming to scale performance to 100,000+ TPS.\n\nThe Cancun upgrade \u2013 along with the subsequent Deneb upgrade \u2013 represents a significant milestone in Ethereum's journey towards establishing itself as a leading decentralized finance platform.\n\nDanksharding and Proto-Danksharding\n\nDanksharding and proto-danksharding are different iterations of the sharding technology developed for Ethereum. Named after Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist, danksharding is a type of sharding that serves as the final phase of the Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) upgrade. It concentrates on optimizing data availability for rollups within the Ethereum network.\n\nTechnically speaking, danksharding is a design that introduces the concept of a merged market fee. While traditional sharding has different blocks and block proposers for each shard, there is only one block proposer in danksharding. In simple terms, danksharding can enhance transaction processing and streamline data storage by simplifying the sharding architecture and prioritizing data management.\n\nIn the context of the upgrade, proto-danksharding (introduced by EIP-4844) serves as a prototype of danksharding. It\u2019s a temporary solution that can significantly reduce gas fees associated with rollups before the complete implementation of the danksharding framework.\n\nBlob-carrying transactions\n\nBlob-carrying transactions were introduced along with proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to help reduce gas fees. Blob-carrying transactions allow the temporary storage and retrieval of off-chain data, meaning extra data can be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.\n\nBenefits of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade can provide a range of benefits, including faster transaction processing, reduced transaction costs, optimized data management, and improved cross-chain communication. By introducing the concept of blob-carrying transactions, the upgrade aims to streamline data processing and enhance overall network efficiency.\n\n1. Better scalability: Proto-danksharding introduces temporary data storage capacity, allowing Layer 2 rollups (and the network as a whole) to process more transactions per second.\n\n2. Reduced transaction costs: Blob-carrying transactions allow extra data to be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.\n\n3. Optimized data management: EIP-1153 can optimize block space and reduce on-chain data storage costs.\n\n4. Better cross-chain communication: EIP-4788 aims to improve interoperability between different blockchain networks by exposing the Beacon chain to execution layers.\n\n5. Improved security: EIP-6780 can reduce the risk of smart contract termination by disempowering the SELFDESTRUCT code, enhancing the security of user data and funds.\n\nPotential Risks of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade\n\nThere might be risks related to the potential impact of the upgrade on existing smart contracts and the intricacies of integrating new data storage techniques. These require extensive testing and careful consideration during the implementation phase to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb upgrade was initially planned to go live in October 2023 but was later delayed to the first half of 2024. It went live on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024 (at epoch 269,568). Node operators and stakers must upgrade their software to releases listed in the official announcement.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade marks a significant leap forward in Ethereum's quest for improved scalability, efficiency, and user experience. By introducing proto-danksharding and laying the groundwork for future advancements, the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade will likely enhance the realm of decentralized finance and blockchain technology.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This content is presented to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis for general information and educational purposes only, without representation or warranty of any kind.

        "content": "Into The Cryptoverse CEO Benjamin Cowen recently discussed Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) performance in relation to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance as the flagship digital asset.\n\nIn a recent YouTube video, Cowen suggests a continued rise in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), indicating that Ethereum may lag behind and show smaller gains compared to BTC.\n\nCowen explains that his crypto portfolio has predominantly held more Bitcoin because he anticipates that BTC will outperform numerous assets, though not all.\n\nAdditionally, Cowen notes that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is encountering substantial resistance after falling below the trendline and attempting a retest.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin and Ethereum outperform traditional assets in 2023\n\nA BTC rally would result in the breakdown of Ether-Bitcoin, he explained. He pointed out how the ETH/BTC pair finally broke the wedge to the downside, highlighting that it\u2019s akin to what happened in the last cycle.\n\nAs he connects the dots, the Ether-Bitcoin pair is potentially backtesting the trendline that served as support in October 2022, March 2023, June 2023, and September 2023. Since the ETH/BTC pair is now testing from beneath the wedge in November 2023, it could offer a significant resistance level.\n\nHowever, Cowen cautions that even if ETH/BTC manages to move above the trendline, the pair will encounter several resistance levels to the upside. These levels must be successfully flipped as support to convincingly reverse the downtrend.\n\nHe further explained, stating that, there are numerous resistance levels. Whether one opts to depict them horizontally or analyze them differently, ETH/BTC still faces a significant challenge. It must have to overcome these resistance levels to indicate a meaningful reversal.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH/BTC is valued at 0.05578 BTC, equivalent to $2,068.80 on Tradingview. Meanwhile, BTC/USDT is valued at $37,112, according to Coingecko.\n\nETF expectations\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum has significantly influenced the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has reached $37,000, marking highs not seen since May 2022. This may be driven by the ongoing expectation that U.S. regulators approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum has rallied close to $2,100, reclaiming the $2,000 level for the first time since mid-July. The rise in digital assets, especially XRP, may also be attributed to Bitcoin surpassing $35,000.\n\nAdditionally, news about BlackRock planning to file for an ETH-based ETF may have also fueled Ethereum\u2019s upward momentum.\n\nFollowing the anticipation of the ETF approval, which has propelled cryptocurrency prices and related stocks, This rally could be part of a broader uptrend in the crypto sector, recognized as a significant $17.7 trillion opportunity by market strategists.\n\nHowever, altcoins like XRP, DOGE, UNI, and XLM have experienced declines, possibly due to a pause in capital rotation towards smaller tokens.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell recently delivered a policy address to the Economic Club of New York, providing insights into the current state of the US economy and monetary policy.\n\nThis statement is significant given the critical juncture of the U.S. economy, marked by improving inflation figures alongside surging Treasury yields, creating conflicting signals about the direction of monetary policy.\n\nInterpreted as a signal, Powell\u2019s statement suggests that the Fed might persist with its tightening cycle, contrary to recent market expectations of a more dovish approach."

His bullish stance comes at a time when both cryptocurrencies are experiencing a bear market, with Ethereum trading at $2,097 and Bitcoin at $37,083 as of today.\n\nHayes attributes his predictions to the ongoing debasement of global currencies. He believes that this economic backdrop will elevate Bitcoin and Ethereum to the status of crypto's reserve assets, setting them apart from other cryptocurrencies which he views as less significant.\n\nOn Friday, Hayes reiterated his confidence in the two leading cryptocurrencies, foreseeing a 4,669% increase in Ethereum's value. He also maintained his belief in Bitcoin's potential to hit the $1 million mark. This came after a week where Bitcoin saw an increase of seven percent in its value to $37,112.53, and Ethereum rose twelve percent to $2,058.51.\n\nHayes also sees potential in layer-one blockchains like despite their struggles during the current market downturn. He suggests they could offer significant returns but questions their ability to outdo Ethereum in areas like active developers, DApp activity, or Total Value Locked (TVL). He described these alternatives as overhyped and unlikely to surpass Ethereum's dominance.\n\nIn addition to his forecasts for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hayes predicts a value surge in decentralized applications (DApps) and their associated tokens. While acknowledging the increased risks involved, he hints at the substantial returns they could yield for investors willing to navigate the volatile crypto landscape.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The target objective for such a technical formation is determined by measuring the height of the triangle and superimposing it at the breakout point.\n\nFor Ethereum price, the height of the triangle is around 134%, from $865 to $2,035 on the weekly timeframe. Superimposing this percentage difference on the weekly chart puts a target objective of $4,736.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) spurs optimism, moving north to signify rising momentum while its position at 64 shows there is still more room to the north.

The lowest was 12,810 transactions on Nov. 5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of transaction volume, Bitcoin saw $24.4 billion in the last 24 hours, with a high of $39.02 billion and a low of $18.1 billion within the same week. Ethereum's large transaction count stood at 3,560 in the last 24 hours, reaching a seven-day high of 7,590 transactions and a low of 3,040.\n\nIts transaction volume echoed this trend, with $2.91 billion in the last 24 hours, peaking at $6.59 billion and a low of $2.47 billion.\n\nFor Polygon, the number of large transactions reached a seven-day high of 209 transactions, the same as its count in the last 24 hours, with a low of 34 transactions. The transaction volume mirrored this surge, with the last 24 hours seeing $194.42 million, a seven-day high of $357.59 million and a low of $28.81 million.\n\nRenewed institutional demand\n\nThe significant increase in whale transactions across these cryptocurrencies is largely attributed to renewed institutional interest. The crypto market is abuzz with anticipation for the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs by January 2024, a development that is expected to further fuel institutional demand.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock's plans to introduce a spot Ethereum ETF have added to this excitement. Institutional demand plays a crucial role in the crypto market, as it not only brings substantial capital but also lends credibility and stability to the digital currency ecosystem.\n\nThe entry of large financial players and the creation of more accessible investment vehicles like ETFs are seen as key drivers for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies."

        "title": "Why WNBA Star Jewell Loyd Relies on Crypto\u2014And Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Her 'Anchors' - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNobody in the WNBA can put the ball in the basket quite like Jewell Loyd, whose 939 points scored for the Seattle Storm this past year set the league\u2019s single-season scoring record. That surpassed Diana Taurasi\u2019s previous record of 860 points scored in 2006.\n\nOff the court, Loyd has become the face of crypto-savvy athlete investors for Coinbase, which has been the exclusive cryptocurrency partner of the NBA and WNBA since 2021.\n\nThe 30-year-old Chicagoland native bought her first Bitcoin in 2013 while playing collegiately at Notre Dame. Loyd and her brother, former pro basketball player Jarryd Loyd, entered the crypto market together after growing up with parents who stressed the importance of financial literacy.\n\n\u201cI was one of the first people to come out and publicly say I\u2019m investing in crypto and taking some of my salary in that,\u201d Loyd told Decrypt. \u201cRight after that, any team we played always had one person who came up to me like \u2018Yo, why'd you do this? What is this?\u2019\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImage: Klutch Sports Group\n\n\u201cThat was my time to educate,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhich was cool because I wasn\u2019t the kid in school that everyone asked how they figured a question out. I was the one always asking questions. So to have that reversed was kinda cool.\u201d\n\nCoinbase creates crypto educational content in partnership with the WNBA, and introduced an in-person crypto crash course to rookies at the 2022 WNBA Draft. Loyd converts a portion of her WNBA salary into cryptocurrency through the Coinbase app, with Bitcoin and Ethereum comprising her majority holdings.\n\n\u201cTo me, those are like the anchors,\u201d she said of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the leading cryptocurrencies. \u201cA basketball analogy is that you always need a good center. And those two are good centers for me.\"\n\nAfter making her fifth All-Star team this past season, Loyd signed a two-year, $463,000 contract extension with the Storm to remain where she\u2019s won two WNBA titles (2018, 2020) since Seattle drafted her with the first-overall pick in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith salaries not nearly as lucrative as their male NBA counterparts, many WNBA players play overseas during offseasons for added income. Crypto\u2019s decentralized nature has been useful to Loyd as she\u2019s played for professional teams based in Turkey, China, South Korea, and Spain.\n\n\u201c[Coinbase] has been one of my personal favorite partnerships with the WNBA, because obviously I\u2019m invested in it\u2014but it also lets women get ahead in the financial world,\u201d Loyd said. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky to play overseas and live overseas, but sending money and using money overseas is very hard. Having a [faster] and more inexpensive way to transfer money overseas and back and forth makes sense.\u201d\n\nCoinbase gave out $120,000 in Bitcoin to players on the New York Liberty and Las Vegas Aces as part of its sponsorship of the WNBA Commissioner's Cup midseason tournament in August. The league has also offered NFTs to fans though Coinbase, such as a digital collectible to commemorate Loyd\u2019s Storm teammate Sue Bird for those who attended Bird\u2019s jersey retirement ceremony at Seattle\u2019s Climate Pledge Arena in June.\n\nLoyd said that Crypto\u2019s biggest assist has come during her continued efforts to aid Rwanda, where Loyd and her brother send computers and money to support locals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to figure out ways to send money to help our cause, and without using crypto, it would have been so much harder,\u201d she told Decrypt. \u201cWhen they need it right away, it gets there. It\u2019s more efficient and we see more change that way with the community we\u2019re working with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking in Rwanda, they\u2019re so talented. They just don\u2019t always have the resources,\u201d Loyd added. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about giving to the next generation of kids and athletes. Anyone who wants to learn, I\u2019m willing to help them.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Ethereum has hit a high of $2,132, riding a wave of enthusiasm driven by the news of Blackrock\u2019s recent submission of an ETF for SEC review, as per Santiment X post. This surge reflects the growing optimism surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency in the market.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Ethereum has reached as high as $2,132 as optimism surrounding the #2 asset in #crypto surged with #Blackrock's new submitted #ETF for the #SEC's review. Our latest insight looks at $ETH's #onchain health and its chances to continue its growth. \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/8sBC9d1lWT pic.twitter.com/2PruVIM4Ve \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 11, 2023\n\nEthereum dominates discussions in the crypto sphere, marking the highest increase in conversation compared to its usual trends. The spike in interest correlates with Blackrock\u2019s confirmation of an official filing for a Spot Ethereum ETF with Nasdaq, now awaiting SEC approval.\n\nThis revelation has infused a moderate level of euphoria among traders, propelling ETH\u2019s price to the cusp of a 1.5-year high. The crypto community, both traders and influencers, is ablaze with bullish sentiments regarding the potential impact of these ETFs on the crypto sector.\n\nThe industry also speculates that Blackrock\u2019s move may signal positive indications for their earlier Bitcoin ETF filing in June. However, the certainty of these ETFs remains a subject of debate, albeit Ethereum\u2019s significant lead in social volume reinforces its current prominence.\n\nConversely, deeper insights into Ethereum\u2019s network health via Santiment\u2019s metrics reveal a mixed picture. While some utility metrics show strength with rising transaction volume and circulation, signals of concern emerge. The surge in whale transactions, simultaneous with substantial dumping by key stakeholders in the $100K-$1M tier, raises alarms of profit-taking.\n\nEthereum Surges to $2,132 as Blackrock's Move Sparks Enthusiasm 6\n\nMoreover, the spike in Ethereum\u2019s social dominance amid price surges indicates elements of FOMO and greed, adding complexity to the overall outlook.\n\nEthereum Surges to $2,132 as Blackrock's Move Sparks Enthusiasm 7\n\nThe community, while excited about the ETF potential, is cautioned against the uncertainty of its confirmation. The fervor might simmer down, giving way to impatience in the coming weeks or months.\n\nThe future of Ethereum\u2019s growth remains subject to the intricate interplay between market dynamics, investor behavior, and regulatory decisions.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nThe present value of Ethereum stands at $2,064.29, accompanied by a trading volume of $13.86 billion within the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization is estimated at $248.26 billion, contributing to a market dominance of 17.48%. Notably, there was a decrease of -1.69% in the ETH price over the past day.\n\nSource: CoinMarketcap\n\nAs per Coincodex\u2019s current forecast, Ethereum\u2019s value is anticipated to climb by 5.14%, aiming for $2,165.91 by November 15, 2023. Coincodex technical analysis indicates a prevailing bullish sentiment, corroborated by a Fear & Greed Index reading of 70, indicating a state of \u201cGreed.\u201d In the previous 30 days, Ethereum has experienced 23/30 (77%) days of positive growth, showcasing an 8.11% price fluctuation.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price consolidates above $2,035 within an ascending triangle pattern formed by connecting swing highs and lows. Traders eye a breakout from the horizontal trendline. The pattern suggests a target of $4,736, derived from a 134% triangle height. Positive RSI and bullish AO hint at sustained momentum and market strength.\n\nSource: Tradingview.com\n\nNote: The details on this page about markets and instruments are like a sneak peek \u2013 just info, not a nudge to buy or sell.

        "content": "BlackRock intends to launch an Ethereum ETF, with Coinbase as the custodian of ether and an unnamed third party holding its cash.\n\nFollowing the news of the Ether ETF, ETH surged by 10% to nearly $2,100, reaching a 7-month high.\n\nSeveral other companies, including VanEck, Ark Invest and 21Shares, Hashdex, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, and Grayscale, have filed for or launched Ethereum ETFs.\n\nThrough a recent filing on Nasdaq, it was revealed that BlackRock, an American multinational investment management corporation, is planning to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will hold Ethereum\u2019s ether. Following the news, ETH\u2019s value significantly increased.\n\nAt the time this article is published, Ether\u2019s price pushed above $2,000.\n\nRead more cryptocurrency news:\n\nBlackRock ETH ETF\n\nAs per the stock exchange\u2019s Nasdaq filing, BlackRock is pursuing listing its product on the platform. Moreover, it also states that the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase would act as the custodian of the ether held by the product, while an unnamed third party would hold its cash.\n\nFollowing this, CoinDesk noted that BlackRock also has a market surveillance agreement with Coinbase which appears to be essential for obtaining approval for such ETFs from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccordingly, it seems that the filing tried to address possible objections from the US SEC to the surveillance-sharing agreement by stating that BlackRock believes the prices of CME Group\u2019s ether futures closely match spot ETH prices.\n\nThe filing asserted that either CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that affects both futures ETFs and spot exchange-traded products, or that surveillance cannot do so for either type of product.\n\n\u201cHaving approved ETH futures ETFs in part based on such surveillance, the Commission has clearly determined that CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that would affect spot ETPs, and the Sponsor thus believes that it must also approve spot ETH ETPs on that basis,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nPreviously, the corporate entity, iShares Ethereum Trust, BlackRock\u2019s ETF Division, has recently been registered in the state of Delaware. However, it must be noted that offering ETFs still requires registration and approval from US regulators.\n\nThe U.S. SEC is currently reviewing 12 spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications, including the previous BTC ETF application from BlackRock. The SEC has until November 17 to approve all of these applications if it intends to do so this year. If the SEC cannot approve all of the applications by this deadline, the ETH ETF plan will have to wait until next year to be approved.\n\nEther Price Surge\n\nFollowing the news about the Ether ETF, the price of the crypto surged 10% to nearly $2,100. This increase has led ETH to reach its 7-month High.\n\nCurrently, CoinGecko data shows that ETH is currently valued at $2,105.99 and was up by 9.1% for the last 24 hours.\n\nOther ETH ETF Filings\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, there are currently five other ETH ETF filings.\n\nVanEck\n\nThe VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), launched on October 2, 2023, is an exchange-traded fund that seeks capital appreciation by investing in ether futures contracts. The fund is actively managed and provides exposure to ether-linked investments through an accessible exchange-traded vehicle. The fund does not invest in ether or other digital assets directly.\n\nArkInvest and 21Shares\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares have partnered to launch a new suite of digital asset exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The suite comprises five ETF products that will be listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and are scheduled to begin trading the following week. The companies will use on-chain signals and their crypto-native expertise to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing in BTC and ETH futures contracts.\n\nHashdex\n\nAccording to its website, the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF (HETH.BH) is a fully physically backed ETF that seeks to track the investment results of the Nasdaq Ether Reference Price\u2122 Index (NQETH\u2122), a basket composed entirely of Ethereum. Moreover, it stated that the fund is listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange and is only available to institutional investors.\n\nInvesco and Galaxy\n\nAs per a report, Invesco and Galaxy Digital have filed for a spot Ethereum ETF with the US SEC on September 29, 2023. The Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF is noted to \u201creflect the performance of the spot price of ether\u201d by storing units of the crypto with an unnamed custodian.\n\nGrayscale\n\nIn addition to their BTC ETF, Grayscale also filed an application to convert Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot ETH ETF.\n\nWhat are ETFs?\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that are listed and traded on stock exchanges, just like individual stocks. ETFs are designed to track the performance of a specific market index, commodity, bond, or basket of assets.\n\nIn the web3 space, the current available crypto as an ETF is only Bitcoin following Grayscale\u2019s successful appeal to the SEC to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nThis article is published on BitPinas: BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF Confirmed, Ether Surge in Price\n\nDisclaimer:"

        "content": "A crypto pundit has expressed his bullish outlook on XRP and other protocols that he claims have no ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China\u2019s ruling party, as he positions them to benefit most from the upcoming bull run.\n\nIn a recent post, influential crypto commentator BoringSleuth hinted at a strategic advantage for cryptocurrencies not entangled with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the upcoming bull market.\n\nAccording to him, protocols avoiding association with the CCP would thrive in the coming market cycles. BoringSleuth singled out Constellation (DAG) as a prime example. He also pointed to XRP as another well-positioned asset.\n\nThe protocols that weren\u2019t in bed with the CCP will be the benefactors of future bull cycles. A protocol like $DAG, who works with the DOD is one example of a well positioned protocol. $XRP is another. \u2014 TruthLabs ? (@BoringSleuth) November 11, 2023\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt bears mentioning that Constellation boasts ties with the U.S. Air Force in a Department of Defense (DoD) partnership that started in 2019. Details of the partnership came to light in August 2021, with the Phase II of the collaboration announced to have been completed in May this year.\n\nXRP Boasts Robust Potential\n\nFurthermore, BoringSleuth\u2019s endorsement of XRP stems from the robust potential the asset holds. The mention of XRP\u2019s detachment with China also prompts a closer look at the ongoing rivalry between the XRP and Ethereum communities.\n\nAs both assets vie for market dominance, their supporters have continuously engaged in heated debates. Last August, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said XRP lost its right to protection when Ripple executives threw Ethereum under the bus in claims that the project is \u201cChinese-controlled\u201d during the SEC\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nNonetheless, amid XRP\u2019s victory in the lawsuit, BoringSleuth\u2019s nod to the asset suggests a belief in its resilience and potential to capitalize on the forthcoming bullish trends. The XRP community has also repeatedly propagated claims of Ethereum\u2019s ties to China.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nClaims of Ethereum Ties to China\n\nSeveral pundits have jumped on this narrative, and BoringSleuth is one of them. Although his recent post does not specifically highlight this, he had previously taken to X to express his concerns.\n\nButerin has also claimed that XRP is centralized, yet people still consider it a crypto asset. Last month, BoringSleuth accused Buterin of securing funding from CCP-affiliated entities in the project\u2019s early days.\n\nThe post unfolded a narrative wherein over 66% of ETH tokens prior to the Merge allegedly entered into wallets associated with China-backed entities, including the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nThe allegations extended to Ethereum\u2019s pre-sale and ICO backers, claiming they received funds through Wanxiang Blockchain, an entity with connections to China. The Crypto Basic spotlighted these claims in June, as disclosed by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett.\n\nBoringSleuth contended that these entities, purportedly responsible for financing a significant portion of the crypto ecosystem, have manipulated and controlled various aspects of the industry.\n\nHe also questioned the decentralization of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s Proof of Stake model, asserting that the system has never been genuinely decentralized.\n\nHe argued that blockchain has lost its identity. According to him, those who fear loss of power, wealth and influence have hijacked the crypto scene. He alleged that these entities used corruption and theft to gain control over the crypto landscape."

At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $2,038.\n\nAnother altcoin on the trader\u2019s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused Fetch.ai (FET). According to Pentoshi, FET will likely skyrocket once it takes out resistance at $0.49.\n\n\u201cIf it reclaims $0.49, this going to $0.69 in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, FET is worth $0.413.\n\nPentoshi is also keeping a close watch on TOTAL 3, which tracks the total market cap of crypto excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the trader, TOTAL 3 looks bullish and still has more room to move to the upside before hitting a resistance level, suggesting that altcoins could see more rallies in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cStill a ways to go next few weeks overall.

With Bonsai Pay, every Google account can be turned into a non-custodial crypto wallet almost seamlessly.\n\nSending Ether to Gmail account becomes possible with ZK proofs\n\nBonsai Pay by RISC Zero, an open source ZK-powered payments platform designed to allow every Gmail user to receive Ethereum (ETH) payments, has landed to the Sepolia Ethereum testnet. It is a new-gen way to replace sophisticated Ethereum (ETH) wallet addresses with familiar email contacts.\n\nAs per the team's statement, any active Google account is compatible with the service and requires zero additional setup to start receiving ETH funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnically, cryptocurrency is transferred via an escrow contract created on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Recipients can retrieve assets from this escrow just by logging into Gmail and generating a zero-knowledge proof.\n\nJSON-based identity tokens and OpenID Connect Protocol are technologies the new product is backed by. Its core codebase is written in the Rust programming language.\n\nAlso, it leverages the protocol's own virtual machine dubbed RISC Zero zkVM. Moreover, this instrument can be used by third-party developers via API keys.\n\nZK-powered projects on fire as Ethereum's L2s recovering\n\nThe live demo of the protocol has been launched on top of Sepolia: The team invites all developers to stress-test it and share feedback on GitHub.\n\nZK-proof is a cryptographic method by which the prover can prove to the verifier that this or that statement is true, while avoiding disclosing any information beyond the mere fact of the statement's truth.\n\nZK-proofs are used in many of the top-tier L2 protocols on top of the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. Three of them, Polygon zkEVM, zkSync Era and Scroll, showed double-digit increases in TVL over the last 24 hours."

        "content": "BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is doubling down on his massively bullish Bitcoin (BTC) predictions while forecasting that Ethereum (ETH) could hit a six-figure price.\n\nHayes says that the time to turn bullish on crypto is \u201cnow\u201d while unveiling a target of $100,000 for Ethereum \u2013 an increase of about 4,669% from the current level.\n\nThe BitMEX founder also reiterates his prediction that Bitcoin will hit $1 million.\n\nIn a new blog post, Hayes further says that as currencies debase across the globe, the \u201csmartest trade\u201d would be \u201cgoing long crypto.\u201d According to the BitMEX founder, Bitcoin and Ethereum are \u201ccrypto\u2019s reserve assets\u201d while \u201ceverything else is a sh*tcoin.\u201d\n\nBesides Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hayes says there are other opportunities that exist in the crypto space offering the potential of higher returns at a greater risk.\n\n\u201cThen, we get to other layer-one blockchains that claim to be an improvement on Ether. Solana is an example. These all got beaten up real bad during the bear market. As such, they will levitate off extreme lows and provide great returns for intrepid investors. But, they are still all overhyped, me-too, pieces of sh*t that won\u2019t overtake Ethereum in terms of active developers, decentralized applications (DApps) activity, or Total Value Locked.\n\nFinally, all manner of DApps and their respective tokens will pump. This is the most fun, because down here is where you get the 10,000x returns. Of course, you\u2019re also more likely to get rugged, but where there is no risk there is no return.\u201d\n\nEthereum is trading at $2,097 at time of writing while Bitcoin is worth $37,083.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nCryptocurrency analyst Lark Davis hinted at a potential boom for Ethereum with the registration of BlackRock\u2019s IShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware. Expressing confidence in this prediction, Davis speculated that BlackRock wouldn\u2019t undertake such a move unless they were pretty sure about obtaining approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nHe playfully suggested that beyond Ethereum, BlackRock might eventually explore ETFs for other cryptocurrencies like Chainlink, Solana, and even Dogecoin. While BlackRock isn\u2019t the first to file for a spot in Ethereum ETF, joining others like Invesco and Hashdex, Davis sees this as a sign of institutional interest aligning for a significant influx of institutional money.\n\nHighlighting potential numbers, Davis discussed the current Ethereum holdings on exchanges, which amount to about 14 million ETH or $28 billion at the current price. He estimated that if Ethereum attracts half the inflows that Bitcoin does into ETF products, it could result in up to half of the available coins being acquired in the first year alone.\n\nReferencing Galaxy Digital\u2019s estimates for a Bitcoin ETF, Davis halved the numbers for Ethereum, projecting $7 billion in the first year, $14 billion in the second, and $20 billion in the third. He said that such inflows, coupled with increasing demand, could lead to a situation where every Ethereum is bought up within three years.\n\nBeyond BlackRock\u2019s potential move, Davis touched on other bullish catalysts for Ethereum. These include the monthly MACD nearing a bullish cross, with Ethereum catching up to Bitcoin\u2019s trend. Additionally, he noted that 28.3 million ETH is currently staked, creating an over 2-year exit queue and restricting immediate dumping on the market. Davis also pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s deflationary nature, EIP-4844 reducing gas fees on layer twos, and the ongoing migration to layer twos would further drive Ethereum\u2019s growth."

        "content": "JAKARTA - Japan's largest investment bank, Nomura Holdings, launched an Ethereum-based investment fund for institutional investors through its digital asset subsidiary, the Laser Digital Asset Management, according to a press release released on November 9.\n\nThe fund, called \"Laser Digital Ethereum Adoption Fund SP\", is the second digital adoption solution investment fund introduced by the Digital Laser after launching the Laser Digital Bitcoin Adoption Fund last September.\n\nThe new fund will focus on the long-term spot position on Ethereum, reported by CryptoSlate. The fund is expected to increase yields through innovative strategies involving ETH staking owned by the fund. The fund is managed as a separate portfolio in the Laser Digital Funds SPC, a separate portfolio company listed in the Cayman Islands.\n\nLaser Digital has partnered with Komainu as a store for the assets of the fund. The company also acts as a store of assets for the Bitcoin Digital Laser fund. Komainu is a company regulated by the UK Financial Behavior Authority and the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority in Dubai.\n\nSebastian Guglietta, head of the Laser Digital Asset Management and former Chief Scientist Officer Nomura, said his company sees Ethereum as a technology catalyst that will digitize the economy. He added that in the long term, exposure to Ethereum is very important to capture the structural technology trend of the web economy 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Total King, head of the Laser Digital Asset Management distribution, said that the fund would simplify investment in digital assets and provide a safe way for institutional investors to gain exposure in the industry because it is fully regulated.\n\nLaunching CryptoPolitan, Steven Ashley, co-founder and executive chairman at Laser Digital, said that the funds offer added value to investors interested in the technology underlying the Web3 ecosystem, such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\nHe also said that Ethereum has an important role as a building block for this digital infrastructure, and is therefore of interest to their institutional clients. The launch of Ethereum funds by Nomura Laser Digital shows that there is growing interest from traditional financial institutions to integrate digital assets into their investment portfolios.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of ETH has increased by 9.9% in the last 24 hours. Now ETH is trading at IDR 32.8 million based on Coingecko data reports.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.
