        "title": "Here\u2019s what ChatGPT expects from Ethereum for 2024 - AMBCrypto English",
        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe last seven days witnessed some significant developments amid the ongoing bull run.\n\nOn 15 November, asset management giant Blackrock\u2019s spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund (ETF) application officially made its way to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) desk.\n\nThe same day, the SEC notified that it had delayed its decision to approve the rule change requested by Grayscale Investments to convert its Ethereum fund to Futures Ether ETF. The SEC now has until 1 January 2024 to make a decision. It was in September that the asset manager had filed for the change.\n\nThe anticipation around ETFs has certainly led to a wild price rally on the charts. It has, however, led many to question how far such developments could adversely affect the decentralized model of the underlying blockchain technology of the crypto market. This is the reason why AMBCrypto too has looked at what\u2019s in the future for Ethereum.\n\nHow it began and subsequently split\n\nA child of Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum blockchain network was first explored in a whitepaper in 2014. His colleagues on the project included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.\n\nSubsequently, the team founded a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum). The project was launched in 2015.\n\nEthereum was created with the goal of being scalable, programmable, secure, and decentralized. It natively supports smart contracts, a key component of decentralized apps. Smart contracts, in tandem with blockchain technology, enable a large number of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nUsers can also generate and exchange non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are tokens that can be linked to specific digital assets such as photos. Furthermore, several other cryptocurrencies use the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have used it for initial coin offerings.\n\nOnly a year after its launch, the project split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic [ETC].\n\nWhat happened was that in 2016, a group of network participants gained majority control of the Ethereum blockchain to steal ether worth more than $50 million which had been raised for a project. Most of the Ethereum community opted to reverse the theft by invalidating the existing Ethereum blockchain and approving a blockchain with a revised history\u2014Ethereum.\n\nHowever, a fraction of the community chose to maintain the original version of the Ethereum blockchain. The unaltered version of the blockchain permanently split to become Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe event came to be known as the Hard Fork.\n\nThe Merge and the Shapella\n\nEthereum initially employed the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. It required energy-intensive computing referred to as mining to validate blocks.\n\nOwing to criticism around the mechanism\u2019s environmental impact, the project transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022. The event came to be known as the Merge.\n\nIt is critical at this juncture that we understand what both these mechanisms are and how they differ.\n\nA consensus mechanism consists of the rules and protocols that govern how a blockchain network reaches an agreement on its state. The two most popular mechanisms are PoW and PoS.\n\nPoW requires the utilization of computational power by miners to solve challenging mathematical riddles and validate transactions. The first miner who solves the challenge receives fresh coins and transaction fees. Although it is though to be more secure and decentralized, it also uses a significant amount of energy and resources.\n\nInstead of requiring miners to solve problems, PoS requires validators to stake some of their coins as collateral. The network then chooses a validator at random to construct a new block depending on stake size and other parameters. The validator is compensated with transaction fees rather than fresh currencies.\n\nPoS is considered more scalable and energy-efficient than PoW.\n\nAt press time, a total of 28,195,445 ETH tokens were staked, valued at $55.6 billion.\n\nETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market cap above $233 billion.\n\nA recent CoinGecko report put Ethereum as the top Layer-1 (L1) blockchain. Its total value locked (TVL) stood at $23.0 billion in October 2023.\n\nIn 2023, it reached its yearly peak TVL of $31.5 billion in April. This was shortly after the Merge.\n\nAt this point, we decided it\u2019s a good time to solicit ChatGPT, the pioneering AI bot, for critical advice on these developments.\n\nChatGPT has proven to be valuable for traders and analysts. I spoke to ChatGPT about these development while touching a bit on ETH\u2019s price.\n\nAt first, ChatGPT wasn\u2019t able to provide any details. So I decided to educate and jailbreak it.\n\nWe then asked it about the impact of the Merge on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nThe bot told me that the Merge catalyzed a surge in demand and confidence. Its response was not a departure from real-time data.\n\nIn April 2023, Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai hard fork, also referred to as Shapella, got finalized. The upgrade allowed users to unstake their ETH tokens for the first time since December 2020.\n\nNotably, the Shapella is a combination of the Shanghai and Capella upgrade. The Shanghai upgrade takes place on the execution level, while Capella takes place on the consensus level.\n\nThe upgrade was the most significant development of the second-largest blockchain since the Merge.\n\nIs Ethereum a commodity or a security?\n\nSimilar to most cryptocurrencies, there has been a lot of debate over the fact whether Ethereum is a commodity or a security.\n\nIn a critical Uniswap court case, the judge ruled in August that ETH is a commodity. The SEC has shied away from doing so even if it hasn\u2019t gone after ether like other tokens.\n\nRecently, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart underlined the SEC\u2019s unsaid stance over the issue.\n\nEven if SEC won\u2019t explicitly claim ETH to be a commodity in the way that they do for Bitcoin. They have implicitly accepted its commodity status for years. Huge shoutout to @SGJohnsson who has been critical in forming some of my views on this topic. https://t.co/vLq2abeJNO \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 16, 2023\n\nHowever, we should also take note of any non-explicit classification so far. The stance of regulatory bodies has also evolved with years, with courts intervening time and again.\n\nI asked ChatGPT about Ethereum\u2019s future performance\n\nEthereum has slowly emerged as one of the most prominent blockchain networks. As ideated, it supports a large number of L2 blockchains. The TVL of Ethereum-based L2 networks recently surged to an all-time high, surpassing $13.8 billion\n\n? The Total Value Locked (TVL) in all #Ethereum Layer 2 networks has surged to an all-time high, surpassing $13.8 billion. ? @Arbitrum takes the lead with TVL of $7.5 billion.https://t.co/5mn1kjq991 pic.twitter.com/Vr4GOgVPGX \u2014 GN Crypto ?? (@GNcrypto_news) November 16, 2023\n\nThanks to the recent bull run, ETH has been trading around the $2,000-mark for the past few days. At press time, ETH was exchanging hands at $1,986.50.\n\nWhile Ethereum\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested below the neutral 50-mark, its Money Flow Index (MFI) rested above it. It seemed that the bears and bulls are engaged in a tug of war in regard to ETH.\n\nWe then asked ChatGPT to predict Ethereum\u2019s price towards the end of the first quarter in 2024.\n\nIt forecasted ETH\u2019s price to git $7,000 by the end of Q1 2024. In essence, it expected ETH to surge more than 3x during the next five months \u2014 an extraordinary expectation, to be frank.\n\nNext, we asked it what it thinks of ETH\u2019s price by the end of the next year.\n\nThe bot told me that it predicted ETH to reach $10,000 by the end of 2024. It expected the cryptocurrency to rise 5x over the next year.\n\nWhile it is a very high expectation, we shouldn\u2019t outright dismiss it. We are yet to see the wider implications of the ETFs on the crypto market. It is quite possible it might lead to wider adoption, leading to a surge in token prices.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nConclusion\n\nFollowing the encounter with ChatGPT, I must admit that it may be a good idea to leverage its capabilities. As technology develops, so does its potential to revolutionize the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nBesides, there has been a slow rate in the network growth of several crypto projects recently. But with ChatGPT available, crypto education and adoption could improve.\n\nMore importantly, you may want to take its \u201cclassic\u201d response a little seriously.\n\nAs far as Ethereum\u2019s price analysis and prediction are concerned, ChatGPT turned out to be a reliable ally. You only need to interact with it enough and it will guide you to the moon.\n\nWhile ChatGPT predicts ETH to hit the price of $10K by the end of 2024, its on-chart metrics don\u2019t suggest a bull run."

        "content": "On-chain fees for Bitcoin transactions have surpassed those on Ethereum for the first time in three years.\n\nOptimism surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the rising popularity of Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions has led to a rise in transaction fees on the network, which surpassed fees on Ethereum for the first time since 2020.\n\nAccording to data from Crypto Fees, Bitcoin transaction fees reached a daily high of $11.6 million, outpacing the $5.6 million in daily transaction fees recorded by Ethereum over the same period.\n\nHowever, on a weekly basis Ethereum transaction fees stands at around $8.3 million, while Bitcoin averaged $7 million in fees.\n\nRead more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Calls Bitcoin an \u2018International Asset\u2019 that Could \u2018Revolutionize Finance\u2019\n\nStill, the shift in daily metrics potentially implies a change in current market dynamics, especially when taking into account the factor at which Bitcoin fees have risen over the last few weeks.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Bitcoin generated $11M in transaction fees. That is twice what Ethereum did, and up 20X from the amount it was generating two weeks ago. All it took was a little magic from the @TaprootWizards pic.twitter.com/zp6OOh0gUB \u2014 Mippo \ud83d\udfea (@MikeIppolito_) November 19, 2023\n\n\u201cIt gets even better when you look under the hood. Transaction fees (which need to grow for the network to be sustainable) are now 25% of miner revenue. That\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been in a long, long time,\u201d said Michael Ippolito, co-founder of Blockworks, on X.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Is Finishing Out 2023 as More Valuable Than the Rest of the Entire Crypto Ecosystem\n\nWhile some market participants attribute the surge in Bitcoin network activity to the price action surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval on the horizon, others, including Ippolito, believe that a renewed interest in ordinal inscriptions was responsible for most of the activity.\n\nBREAKING: Ordinals inscriptions made up 57% of Bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours driving up fees to a 5 month high of 205 sat/vB. Ordinals are the #1 use case on Bitcoin right now. pic.twitter.com/lVvNZIG2uV \u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) November 9, 2023\n\nCongested mempools and high levels of transaction fees are usually a deterrent to user growth, but surprisingly, on-chain data shows that this hasn\u2019t been the case this time around.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that the Bitcoin adoption rate reached a yearly high of 67.62% last week."

Connecting these swing points using trend lines, reveals an ascending triangle setup. A decisive weekly candlestick close above the triangle\u2019s horizontal resistance level at $2,000 will signal a breakout.\n\nIn such a case, this technical formation forecasts a 43% rally to $2,943, obtained by measuring the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point of $2,000.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum price sits above the Momentum Reversal Indicator\u2019s (MRI) resistance level of $1,936 and below the ascending triangle\u2019s horizontal resistance level. From the looks of it, ETH seems to have flipped the $1,936 hurdle into a support floor.\n\nIf Bitcoin price does not crash wildly in the upcoming weeks, Ethereum price is set to break out and kickstart an upswing to $2,943. But this move is likely to face resistance around the $2,539 hurdle, which served as a critical support level in March 2022.\n\nWhile $2,943 is the theoretical target, ETH could rise higher and tag the next MRI resistance level of $3,186.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market wraps up a dynamic week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding steady after a significant drop in inflation. Despite the resilience of the market leaders, the spotlight was on altcoins, particularly Kaspa (KSP), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), showcasing notable gains and hinting at potential growth in the near future.\n\nAltcoins Take Center Stage\n\nKaspa (KSP) emerged as the week\u2019s star performer, experiencing an impressive 64% surge, reaching a peak of $0.1519. As of the latest data, KSP is trading at $0.1379, maintaining robust performance despite a slight 2.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nRender (RNDR) followed closely behind, boasting a 50% gain over the week. Currently trading at $3.58, RNDR displays a marginal 3.46% increase in price, accompanied by a 42.49% decrease in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) captured attention with a weekly increase exceeding 30%, now trading at $2.18. NEAR\u2019s impressive performance includes a 20% price increase and an 88.84% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nOther notable altcoins, including Avalanche (AVAX), Immutable (IMX), and Mantle (MNT), also reported gains in their weekly charts. AVAX showed a 24% increase, IMX rose by 22%, and MNT exhibited a 10% uptick, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum Weekly Review\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum remained stable after a notable drop in inflation from a 40-year high last June, currently standing at 3.2%, slightly above the Fed\u2019s target, according to the CPI report. Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase, trading just below its annual peak at approximately $38,000 earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge marks its most robust four-week performance since January, witnessing a remarkable 42% increase from just under $17,000 to nearly $24,000. Bitcoin\u2019s price dominance has returned, albeit temporarily, with the potential for quick rebounds if market sentiment shifts.\n\nSantiment\u2019s analysis revealed fluctuations in Bitcoin wallets during the recent surge. Numerous new smaller wallets with less than 1 BTC flooded the network, while the 1-100 tier flattened out, and the 100+ tier may be experiencing profit-taking.\n\n\ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc2c\ud83d\udc33 #Bitcoin's wallets have fluctuated during this major market-wide surge. Tons of new smaller wallets with less than 1 $BTC have flooded the network. Meanwhile, the 1-100 tier has flattened out, and 100+ tier may be in the midst of some profit taking. https://t.co/va51CcexC1 pic.twitter.com/PNZtA9ir2U \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 17, 2023\n\nAccording to Santiment, Bitcoin\u2019s NVT ratio has significantly improved, signaling a healthy circulation of unique BTC relative to current market cap levels. IntoTheBlock reported a yearly high in the new adoption rate of Bitcoin, reaching 67.62%, indicating a surge in new market participants.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Bitcoin's NVT (Network Value to Transaction) ratio has improved significantly, one of @santimentfeed's primary alpha #crypto market signals for traders. The metric indicates whether the amount of unique $BTC circulating is healthy relative to current market cap levels. \ud83d\udc4d pic.twitter.com/gu4CDDxMt9 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 16, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s fees rose as ETH surpassed $2,000 last week, but transactions remain relatively cheap compared to previous levels. Santiment highlighted Ethereum\u2019s 38% market value surge in the past four weeks, driven by high network growth and an increase in addresses across different tiers.\n\nAs of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $37,159.19, showing a 1.23% increase over the past seven days and a 2.36% increase in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,023.05, displaying a 0.70% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 4.58% gain over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | Bucking Bearish Trends: Bitcoin\u2019s Unconventional Moonlit Path To A Resilient Bull Cycle"

        "title": "Cardano Founder Debunks \u201cPathological Liar\u201d Claims As New Evidence from Ethereum Days Emerges - The Crypto Basic",
        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sought to clear the air after new evidence emerged about his past involvement with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nCardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has often been haunted by the experience he had in his early days in the blockchain ecosystem, especially while working on Ethereum.\n\nIn the latest development, the Cardano founder was compelled to speak in a 22-minute livestream in which he dispelled the rumors and provided clarity to listeners.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the heart of the current matter was a video and documentation shared by Steven Nerayoff. Nerayoff was an early Ethereum advisor who had access to essential communication within the team. In the documentation being sold as an NFT, Nerayoff shared previously private information on a troubling period in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum team wanted to restructure the project and called on Nerayoff for advice, leading to a lengthy call between the advisor and Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. With or without Vitalik\u2019s permission, Nerayoff recorded the call, which he now wants to monetize as an NFT.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nNotably, Charles Hoskinson was among the major subjects of the call. A transcript of the call shows that Charles was mentioned 69 times, with Nerayoff speaking favorably of the entrepreneur\u2019s involvement with Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNew Evidence Clarifies Charles Hoskinson\u2019s Reputation with Ethereum\n\nSteven Nerayoff\u2019s latest reveal suggests that Charles Hoskinson was a valuable member of the Ethereum Foundation. During the conversation with Vitalik Buterin, Nerayoff spoke highly favorably of Charles Hoskinson and urged the team to bring him back into the ranks, given his experience and strengths.\n\nReviewing this part of the conversation, Charles Hoskinson said in the recent livestream, \u201cHe [Nerayoff] was trying really hard to bring me back into the fold. At this juncture, I was already deep in the thick of things, starting Input Output [Cardano\u2019s engineering arm].\u201d\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Nerayoff\u2019s documentation and call with Vitalik dispel three main accusations that were leveled against him by naysayers. The allegations include that \u2018Charles is a pathological liar, never contributed to the crypto space, and constantly overstated his role in Ethereum\u2019s early development.\u2019\n\nThe Cardano founder, alluding to recent reports by crypto journalist Laura Shin, added that half-baked stories have helped foster those lies. However, such lies hold no water compared to Nerayoff\u2019s independently released information.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson reiterated his long-term commitment to building out Cardano and his reputation in the crypto space. He noted that he has been in cryptocurrency for over 10 years and has had no \u201cclass action lawsuit, legal issues.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the entrepreneur has sustained an impressive track record, having \u2018built a $12 billion dollar valued blockchain, collaborated on over 200 academic research papers, and written a lot of code.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with the economic value of these things. [Yet] You can\u2019t disagree with the fact that I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve been building things,\u201d Charles Hoskinson added.\n\nNotably, Cardano (ADA) has consistently ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in recent years. At the same time, the blockchain has seen increased DeFi TVL in the past few months, underlining its continued growth."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nA recent flurry of activity by ETH whales has injected both curiosity and anticipation into the market. According to on-chain analytics from Lookonchain, one such whale has repositioned their holdings in a notable manner, selling 12,048 ETH worth approximately $23.4 million to repay debt, after initially acquiring it from Binance when ETH was trading around $1,768\u200b\u200b.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis whale, along with others, has utilized ETH as collateral on DeFi lending platforms such as Aave and Compound to borrow stablecoins, with the intention of purchasing even more ETH. This suggests a strategic vote of confidence in ETH's price appreciation potential. Additionally, the withdrawal of a hefty sum of 21,076 ETH, valued at $41.23 million, from Bitfinex by two new wallets indicates a trend of whales moving their funds to cold storage for long-term holding. This behavior typically results in decreased liquidity on exchanges and can potentially buoy the market price\u200b\u200b.\n\nIn a significant transaction, the aforementioned whale placed 7,324 ETH, equating to $14.3 million, as collateral on Compound to borrow $9 million USDT, which was subsequently transferred to Binance. This sequence of transactions is likely aimed at purchasing additional ETH, thus expanding the whale's position in the currency. Such actions reflect a bullish outlook, with these major players positioning themselves to benefit from anticipated price increases and potentially exerting upward pressure on ETH's value\u200b\u200b.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strategic moves by ETH whales underscore a sustained bullish sentiment and a long-term investment perspective. With ETH maintaining support above the $1,970 mark, these investors are seizing opportunities to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency. However, the market remains vigilant, as extensive selling by these whales could prompt a market pullback if they choose to realize profits."

        "content": "Crypto trading volumes soar, BlackRock files to launch spot Ethereum ETF, while Tether goes Bitcoin mining\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of Bitcoin started last week with a sharp move downwards, dropping from around $37,000 to a low near $35,000, before recovering to now trade at $37,100 per coin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, moved steadily upward throughout the past week, going from around $1,940 per coin to a peak near $2,050 before a small correction over the weekend brought ether down to $2,020 a token.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price kept rising as BlackRock \u2013 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2013 filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nThe fund would aim to \u201creflect generally the performance of the price of Ether\u201d, and would have Coinbase as the custodian for the ETH held by the fund. Ethereum\u2019s price started climbing after BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations a week ago.\n\nBlackRock has filed the S-1 prospectus for its Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC, earlier this morning.\n\nThe filing, among other things, appoints Coinbase as the Custodian for the underlying ETH.\n\n\n\nThere appears to be no mention on whether the Trust will actively be staking the ETH\u2026 \u2014 Tree News (@News_Of_Alpha) November 16, 2023\n\nWhile the spot ETH ETF filing helped the price of Ether rise, a fake XRP ETF filing sparked a trading frenzy that saw the price of the cryptocurrency rise as much as 13% throughout the week, before BlackRock denied any involvement. XRP\u2019s price then erased its gains, leading to over $7 million in liquidations.\n\nThe fake XRP ETF filing also appeared on Delaware\u2019s website, and Delaware\u2019s Department of Justice could now be looking into the fraudulent filing. It\u2019s unclear how it ended up on the website.\n\nMeanwhile the cryptocurrency arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Cboe Digital, is set to introduce margined Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on January 11, following their their receipt of approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in June.\n\nThe move will position Cboe Digital as the first regulated U.S. platform to provide both spot and leveraged derivatives on a single platform. Margined futures enable traders to utilize leverage to trade beyond their collateral, a feature not available with regular futures.\n\nCrypto market volume soars amid South Korean trading frenzy\n\nIn the last two months, the volume of the digital asset market has experienced a significant rise, largely driven by trading activity in Asia, particularly South Korea. According to CCData, South Korean exchanges have more than doubled their market share, increasing from 5.2% in January to 12.9% in November. The total trading volume also saw growth in October and November.\n\nThe firm\u2019s recent Exchange Review report details that Upbit, a centralized exchange, witnessed a substantial increase in market share in October, accounting for 9.16% of the trading volume on these platforms.\n\nThis is the highest market share that the Korean cryptocurrency exchange has achieved since its inception, with local traders reportedly focusing on altcoins.\n\nMeanwhile cryptocurrency exchange giant OKX has started offering derivatives trading off of its platform, eliminating the counterparty risk of holding assets on an exchange, at a time in which it\u2019s also introducing its own layer-2 blockchain called X1.\n\nPoloniex, a well-established cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a major security breach after hackers stole over $100 million worth of digital assets from its hot wallets and used some of the funds to pump the price of TRX, a cryptocurrency created by Poloniex investor Justin Sun.\n\nTether to spend $500 million on Bitcoin mining expansion\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has started venturing into the Bitcoin mining industry with a significant investment, aiming to become a global leader in the sector. Tether\u2019s incoming CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed the firm is investing $500 million over the next six months to strengthen its position in the sector.\n\nArdoino has revealed that Tether is establishing Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. Each of these locations will have a power capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts. The company\u2019s objective is to increase its portion of the Bitcoin hashrate, which is the computational power that underpins the network, to 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, global banking giant JPMorgan has launched a new programmable payment option for its institutional clients using its proprietary blockchain platform JPM Coin.\n\nThe latest feature provides institutional clients with the ability to establish treasury operations that are programmable and operate in real-time, laying the groundwork for cutting-edge digital business models, according to JPMorgan.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have. His work has been published in numerous reputable industry publications. Francisco holds various cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

To maintain this positive momentum, Bitcoin will need to clear the resistance at the $37,800 mark or risk finding support around $36,500. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Near Procol (NEAR) has marked a substantial 17 percent price increase over the past week, thanks to its partnership with the South Korean platform Zep for metaverse game development. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading around the $2,000 threshold.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate \u2014 Javier Milei \u2014 won the elections in Argentina. On this account, BTC (+2.2 percent) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37,200 levels. Analysts predict support to range between $33,000 to $34,500 with resistance at $38,000. On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF. Joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, the entry of such financial giants in embracing crypto provides positive signals for the sector.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cDogecoin soared dramatically following a groundbreaking partnership with SpaceX, propelling its value to unprecedented heights. Simultaneously, Bitcoin faces market fluctuations, prompting reflection and comparisons to its 2021 performance. Tether strategically invests $500 million in Bitcoin mining, signalling a deliberate expansion and diversification within the stablecoin sector.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. Overall, while favouring bullish trends above $36,400, the market remains cautious, with immediate resistance and support key for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap crossed the 1.4-trillion dollar mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. ETH breached the $2,000 mark per piece due to the euphoria around the Blackrock spot Ethereum ETF application. BTC crossed the $37,000 mark over the weekend and the market is expected to ride the ETF wave in the coming weeks owing to the favourable macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, both BTC and ETH showed strength, each gaining more than 2.5 percent. This unexpected resilience during the usually quiet weekends might be because of the positive news about Javier Milei, a supporter of Bitcoin, winning the presidential election in Argentina. He sees Bitcoin as a way to return money to the private sector. Looking at the technical side, BTC has consistently bounced back from an important incline trendline support and the 20EMA Daily. Currently, it's trading a bit above $37,300, aiming for the next resistance at $38,000. As for ETH, it's sitting around the Support and resistance flip level of $2,011. Breaking through this could push the price to a major resistance level at $2,130, with ETH keeping above the 20-EMA Daily.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
