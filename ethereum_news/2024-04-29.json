        "title": "New court filings show SEC, Chair Gensler believed ethereum was a security for at least a year - Fox Business",
        "content": "EXCLUSIVE: The Securities and Exchange Commission and its chairman, Gary Gensler, appear to have believed for at least a year that the second largest cryptocurrency, ethereum, may be an unregistered security trading out of compliance with current federal regulations, FOX Business has learned.\n\nThe revelation comes following the filing of an unredacted complaint against the agency by ethereum software company Consensys. The company filed the redacted version of the lawsuit in a Texas federal court last Thursday in response to a so-called Wells notice it received detailing the SEC\u2019s plans to sue the firm for failing to comply with federal securities laws.\n\nThe new documents, filed Monday morning, have yet to be reported. They provide insight into the timeline behind the SEC\u2019s thinking regarding ethereum's alleged status as a security, and shed light on what has been perhaps the biggest question facing the $2 trillion digital asset industry about the regulatory status of a cryptocurrency that is held by millions of investors.\n\nIt should be noted that formal investigations are considered an early step in an SEC investigation and are not necessarily indicative of the wider views of the Commission. An SEC spokesman declined comment.\n\nCRYPTO INDUSTRY FIGHTS BACK AGAINST GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN\n\nConsensys made waves in the crypto world last week when it filed a lawsuit against the SEC claiming the agency is attempting an unlawful power grab by seeking to classify ethereum as a security.\n\nAccording to the new filing, on March 28, 2023, the head of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, Gurbir Grewal, approved a formal order of investigation into ethereum\u2019s status as a security, authorizing enforcement staff to investigate and subpoena individuals and entities involved in the buying and selling of the ethereum token.\n\nConsensys, established by one of the ethereum blockchain founders, Joe Lubin, was among a handful of firms associated with ethereum to receive a subpoena from the SEC around this time, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nCOINBASE DUNKS ON TRADITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS IN $15M NBA AD SPEND\n\nThe filing says the \"Ethereum 2.0\" investigation, as it was called, was based on the SEC's belief that \"possible offers and sales of certain securities, including, but not limited to ETH,\" had occurred since at least 2018. If the Gensler SEC finds ethereum to be a security, it would contradict prior SEC guidance under Chairman Jay Clayton; in June of that year, then-Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman stated in a speech the SEC's position that ethereum, alongside bitcoin, was not a security.\n\nHinman had no immediate comment.\n\nThe price of ethereum jumped 10% following Hinman\u2019s speech, which he gave at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit, as the crypto industry understood the SEC would not be regulating ethereum or bitcoin because, according to Hinman, they were both \"sufficiently decentralized.\" A year later, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced ether to be a commodity that falls under its jurisdiction.\n\nConsensys stated in its lawsuit that it built its business against the backdrop of this regulatory unanimity.\n\nSEN. WARREN CHALLENGER GOES TO BAT FOR COINBASE, CRYPTO INDUSTRY IN SEC LAWSUIT\n\nThe new filings show that the five-member commission approved the Division of Enforcement's \"Ethereum 2.0\" investigation on April 13, 2023, just five days before Gensler appeared before the House Financial Services Committee, where he refused to answer repeated questions from committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., on whether the SEC believed ethereum to be a security.\n\nIn launching the investigation, enforcement staff moved with what securities lawyers say is unusual secrecy. Sources with direct knowledge of the matter tell FOX Business that subpoena recipients were instructed by the SEC to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive information about the progress of the probes. A source who received a subpoena compared the interaction with the SEC to signing a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nIt's unclear why the SEC sought to keep the unfolding inquiry under such tight wraps, but one motive could be the far-reaching implications for the crypto market if the number two cryptocurrency, with a market cap of nearly $400 billion, is deemed a security.\n\nEven before his testimony, Gensler's reluctance to give a definitive answer on ethereum\u2019s regulatory status raised red flags for the crypto industry. Many speculated that ethereum's September 2022 merge to a so-called \"proof-of-stake\" consensus mechanism \u2013 where validators \"stake\" their ethereum holdings to secure the network and create new tokens \u2013 made the crypto more like a security than it did on the original \"proof of work\" consensus mechanism that bitcoin runs on.\n\nGensler made comments alluding to this notion shortly after ethereum\u2019s merge, saying that the nature of proof-of-stake tokens could trigger the so-called Howey Test, a Supreme Court ruling courts use to determine whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract and thus a security.\n\nConsensys' lawsuit reveals that the SEC made numerous document requests over the past year asking for more detailed information regarding the company\u2019s role in the merge to proof-of-stake as well as its acquisitions, holdings and sales of ethereum. It also shows the SEC may believe that sales of ethereum pre-merger, as early as 2018, are securities.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe investigation has escalated in recent weeks, with Consensys receiving its fourth document subpoena in March and a Wells notice on April 10, stating the agency\u2019s intent to bring an enforcement action against the firm for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker-dealer offering unregistered securities, including ethereum, through its MetaMask wallet.\n\nThe complaint would mirror ones brought against exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and cross-border payments company Ripple.\n\nConsensys hopes the court will ultimately settle the dispute over ethereum\u2019s regulatory status."

        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has internally considered Ethereum to be a security for over a year, according to previously redacted portions of a lawsuit filed by software giant Consensys against the SEC that were revealed this morning.\n\nPer Consensys\u2019 complaint, Gurbir Grewal, the Commission\u2019s Director of the Division of Enforcement, issued an internal Formal Order on March 28, 2023, announcing an investigation into \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d authorizing employees of the regulator to investigate and subpoena parties involved in the buying and selling of ETH.\n\nThe order, which Consensys says was approved by the Commission on April 13, 2023, explicitly refers to Ethereum as a security in and of itself, as it authorizes the investigation of \u201ccertain securities, including, but not limited to ETH, as to which no registration statement was or is in effect\u2026 and for which no exemption was or is available.\u201d\n\nThe revelation that the SEC has officially considered ETH to be a security for over a year is a remarkable one. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly deferred when asked explicitly regarding the agency\u2019s stance on the matter. As recently as last month, Gensler refused to state the SEC\u2019s position when it comes to ETH.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn SEC spokesperson told Decrypt that the regulator declines to comment on the matter.\n\nEthereum, which had already been sagging with the rest of the market on Monday, was trading for $3,143.69 at the time of writing\u2014marking a 5% slip from this time yesterday, but only 1.5% lower than this time last week, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nFor years, the crypto industry has held out hope that Ethereum\u2014the second largest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin, and the foundation of the massive Ethereum ecosystem\u2014might be considered a commodity in the American government\u2019s eyes, paving the way for ETH\u2019s integration into the American economy on a trajectory similar to Bitcoin.\n\nThe head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has explicitly declared Ethereum to be a commodity in the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt would appear that the SEC\u2019s scrutiny of Ethereum escalated after the blockchain\u2019s September 2022 merge event, which transitioned it to an energy-efficient proof of stake consensus mechanism. That new structure now allows users to stake ETH with the network to help it function\u2014and accrue rewards in the process\u2014a financial incentive the SEC clearly takes issue with.\n\nIn the year following the SEC\u2019s reported internal Formal Order regarding Ethereum, the agency has steadily ratcheted up its offensive against entities involved with the cryptocurrency. In February, the Ethereum Foundation, the Swiss non-profit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem, was subpoenaed by an unnamed \u201cstate authority.\u201d Several American crypto companies have received subpoenas related to their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nAnd last week, Consensys, perhaps the largest Ethereum-focused American company, filed a preemptive lawsuit against the SEC, arguing that it does not have the grounds to regulate Ethereum, as the asset should not be classified as a security.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to reflect the SEC's decision not to comment on the unredacted lawsuit and to clarify the process of ETH staking.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum network has reached a significant milestone, hitting 1 million validators. Terence Tsao, an Ethereum developer who goes by the name \"Terence.eth\" on X, took to social media to celebrate the milestone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We reached 1 million validators,\" Terence wrote on X, attaching a screenshot. According to the screenshot, Ethereum active validators have reached 1,000,012, while pending validators total 14,379.\n\nThis milestone is accompanied by an impressive figure of approximately 32 million Ethereum staked (32,000,026 ETH). This figure represents around 26% of Ethereum's total supply, demonstrating a substantial degree of participation in ETH staking. Staking is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software.\n\nValidators are critical to the Ethereum network, especially since its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in September 2022. They are responsible for storing data, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, a role previously filled by miners in the proof-of-work (PoW) model, thus keeping Ethereum secure and earning new ETH in the process.\n\nReaching one million validators is more than just a statistic; it represents the enormous amount of trust and resources that users are willing to commit to keeping the ETH network running.\n\nThe Shapella upgrade, which enabled staking withdrawals, has increased the number of validators on the Ethereum network.\n\nPresently, the Ethereum network is gearing up for new upgrades: Electra is the consensus layer (CL) upgrade name for the next immediate hard fork scheduled on Ethereum. Deneb refers to the most recent hard fork activated on Ethereum.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH was down 5.139% in the last 24 hours to $3,123. According to crypto analyst Ali, the Ethereum price action is facing a brickwall resistance at $3,200, where 2.43 million addresses hold 5.14 million ETH."

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Are Slumping Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "These three large-cap tokens are seeing various regulatory pressures impact their valuations today.\n\nMany of the closest-watched large-cap cryptocurrencies are seeing significant selling pressure in the market today. Ethereum (ETH -1.79%), Dogecoin (DOGE -5.49%) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH -2.13%) have dropped 4.5%, 5.8%, and 3.8%, respectively, over the past 24 hours as of 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThese moves come despite relatively strong price action in the stock market, with a number of more speculative meme stocks surging today. With cryptocurrencies associated closely with these assets (particularly when we're talking about meme tokens such as Dogecoin), one needs to ask the question -- what's going on here?\n\nIt does appear some uncertainty around this week's upcoming Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting is leading to declines among major tokens, driving uncertainty with the macro backdrop in this space. But there are also some key token-specific fundamental factors that also appear to be in play. Let's dive into what's causing today's turmoil among these three top tokens.\n\nMacro/regulatory uncertainty remains\n\nEthereum's status as the world's second-largest cryptocurrency means it's a top digital asset of focus for many conventional investors looking to diversify into this space. What it also means is that regulators tend to pay greater attention to this token, particularly with an upcoming decision on spot Ethereum ETFs looming. Uncertainty around these ETF approvals in the U.S. continues to remain high, despite other jurisdictions already approving exchange-traded products aimed at Ethereum.\n\nAdditionally, a lawsuit filed against the SEC by Ethereum developer Consensys has generated significant attention in recent days. This lawsuit aims to prevent what the developer calls an \"unlawful seizure of authority,\" a move many in the crypto community are applauding, ahead of key regulatory decisions in this realm.\n\nOther regulatory impact of various moves from exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN -5.55%) to list Dogecoin futures, among other products, remains to be seen. For now, these three tokens will likely receive outsized scrutiny on this front, with investors clearly taking a more cautious approach to these assets in today's session.\n\nThis slate of regulatory concerns can be capped off by news that a recent payment update on claims tied to Bitcoin Cash and other tokens for those impacted by the Mt. Gox debacle years ago has been provided. This update indicates a completion date for claims has been put forward, leading to likely selling pressure for Bitcoin Cash, at least over the near term.\n\nWill this bearish momentum continue?\n\nFor now, there are plenty of regulatory-related headwinds investors appear to be pricing into the crypto sector. These three tokens have perhaps the most unique and noticeable headwinds, though it's also true that the Securities and Exchange Commission has continue to drive home a hawkish narrative on the space. That could mean continued uncertainty over the near term, which often leads to the kind of volatility we're seeing today.\n\nIt remains to be seen if we'll see an immediate bounce-back from this selling pressure. The crypto market continues to see impressive attention, and while capital flows into digital assets appears to be slowing, these projects are worth considering. Thus, for now, I'm going to keep these projects on my watch list and provide updates as they come."

        "content": "The Gary Gensler-led Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating Ethereum\u2019s security status last year, according to an April 29 court filing by Consensys.\n\nThe filing disclosed that Gurbir Grewal, the Director of the Division of Enforcement, sanctioned the Formal Order of Investigation concerning \u2018Ethereum 2.0\u2019 in March 2023. This Formal Order conferred broader authority upon SEC staff to investigate and subpoena individuals and entities involved in ETH transactions.\n\nIt added:\n\n\u201cThe Formal Order predicates this delegation on the SEC\u2019s information showing possible offers and sales, since at least 2018, of \u2018certain securities, including, but not limited to ETH, as to which no registration statement was or is in effect . . . and for which no exemption was or is available.'\u201d\n\nSubsequently, the SEC has issued subpoenas to numerous individuals and entities with investments in Ethereum, including Consensys.\n\nNotably, this revelation emerged a few days after Consensys lodged a legal action against the SEC on April 25. The company contended that the SEC\u2019s attempt to classify Ethereum as a security represented regulatory overreach, warning that such a designation could stifle innovation and adversely affect developers, investors, and entities utilizing Ethereum\u2019s decentralized infrastructure.\n\nEthereum\u2019s regulatory status\n\nEthereum\u2019s regulatory status has been a persistent issue for the SEC in recent years.\n\nIn 2018, Gensler stated during a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that ETH is not considered a security.\n\nHowever, Gensler\u2019s stance seems to have shifted, particularly following Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof of stake. Despite this, he has refrained from definitively addressing ETH\u2019s status, despite numerous inquiries from stakeholders, including members of Congress.\n\nWhile Gensler has remained silent on the matter, proponents in the crypto community have cited remarks from former SEC officials like Bill Hinman, as well as legal filings from financial regulatory bodies such as the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, to argue that Ethereum does not meet the criteria for classification as a security.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins are on the verge of a major market correction.\n\nIn a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 800,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) may be making one final move to the upside before a market capitulation.\n\n\u201cIn order for confirmation of [bullishness], you would need to see ETH/Bitcoin get above its bull market support band and then start holding it as support. And if you don\u2019t see that, then I still think it\u2019s just going to be yet another lower high that everyone once again got excited about that ultimately resolved to the downside.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also says ETH and alts may be repeating a similar pattern from the last cycle when the TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market capitalization of all altcoins minus Ethereum and stablecoins, suffered a severe correction against Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, the ETH/Bitcoin capitulation occurred, it finalized after alt/Bitcoin pairs broke down.\n\nSo one thing about this bounce is that alt/Bitcoin pairs have not yet broken down. They haven\u2019t had a weekly close below their range low. So I think that you\u2019re seeing something very similar with alt/Bitcoin pairs that you saw over here [in June 2019], one final rally up to the bull market support band \u2013 it didn\u2019t even make it to the bull market support band back then \u2013 and then it came down. I think you\u2019re seeing something like that happen once again with alt/Bitcoin pairs, one final push before capitulation down to the range lows this summer\u2026\n\nI think this is the final push before the final capitulation into the summer, as we get into potential rate cuts.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Price Dips to Weekly Low Amid SEC Security Uncertainty - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of Ethereum dipped overnight following revelations that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has secretly considered the cryptocurrency a security for over a year.\n\nEthereum is currently trading at a weekly low around $3,050, down 3.9% on the day, per data from CoinGecko. In the past day, traders have moved roughly $15 billion worth of volume. ETH is now trading 15% lower than it was a month ago.\n\nIts downward price movement follows the publication of previously redacted portions of a lawsuit filed by Consensys against the SEC. According to the software firm's complaint, an internal Formal Order issued by the regulator in March 2023 explicitly referred to the investigation of \"certain securities, including, but not limited to ETH.\"\n\nThe internal order stands in stark contrast to the regulator's public refusal to explicitly state whether it considers Ethereum a security. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly deferred when asked to outline the SEC's position on the matter, including during a House Financial Services Committee oversight hearing in October 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWere the SEC to define Ethereum as a security, it would also contradict Gensler's own prior statements on the matter; in 2018, while still a lecturer at MIT, he stated that Ethereum is \u201cnot a security\u201d in the eyes of the SEC. Gensler was seemingly referencing an opinion expressed by the SEC's former Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, in a June 2018 speech in which he described Ethereum as \"sufficiently decentralized\" that it could not be considered a security.\n\nHowever, those statements predate Ethereum's 2022 \"Merge,\" in which the blockchain network switched from the proof-of-work consensus mechanism employed by Bitcoin to a proof-of-stake model.\n\nIn September 2022, as the Ethereum network's Merge took place, Gensler suggested that proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies could be considered securities, a view he's since reiterated. And the SEC's March 2023 internal order specifically references an investigation into \"Ethereum 2.0,\" the name commonly used to describe the post-Merge network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC's position on Ethereum comes at a crucial time, as the regulator considers whether approve or reject multiple applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has repeatedly delayed its decision on applications from asset managers including Grayscale, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.\n\nWith a key deadline looming in late May, ETF watchers have turned pessimistic on the chances of approval, with investment bank JP Morgan giving even odds on whether it'll be approved or rejected.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Toobit\n\nNew York, NY, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the looming question on investors' minds is whether Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading digital assets, can withstand the challenges presented by their upcoming halving events. The halving, a programmed reduction in the rewards miners receive for validating transactions, has historically sparked intense speculation and debate within the crypto community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToobit, a pioneering cryptocurrency platform, offers insights into the potential implications of the halving for Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to Toobit's analysis, both Bitcoin and Ethereum face unique challenges and opportunities as they approach their respective halving milestones.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin's halving event, which took place on 19 April 2024, represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency,\" states a spokesperson from Toobit. \"The halving has officially raised the stakes for the asset. Not only is it scarce, but BTC price has hit an all-time high. This shows that there is a viable future for cryptocurrency despite all the noise. Every move from now onwards will dictate cryptocurrency history.\"\n\nWith the issuance of new Bitcoin rewards being cut in half, the Bitcoin halving event underscores the asset's scarcity and reinforces its position as a store of value. However, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin's mining ecosystem and the potential impact on transaction fees.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum's transition to Ethereum 2.0, coupled with its popular EIP-1559 upgrade, adds another layer of complexity to the halving equation. Despite these changes happening several years ago, the Ethereum halving is not as clean cut as the Bitcoin halving, which may make it confusing for unfamiliar users. Toobit emphasizes the importance of staying updated with these developments, as they are responsible for the shaping of Ethereum's future viability as a leading smart contract platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism promised scalability and sustainability benefits, but it also introduced uncertainties regarding its economic model and network security,\" explains Toobit's spokesperson. \"It's easy to get excited about the new ETH price with each halving event and forget about the bigger picture. Therefore, we must also reflect on Ethereum's ongoing efforts to address scalability challenges and enhance user experience with every halving event.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you believe that this is time to start investing in crypto, Toobit is the place to start. Pick your choice of cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL (SOL price), DOGE (DOGE price), ETC (ETC price), FTM (FTM price), Storj (STORJ price), FIL (FIL price) or the 100 other tokens that Toobit offers.

With careful analysis and strategic planning, investors can navigate the halving landscape and capitalize on the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and Ethereum's maturing ecosystems.\n\n\n\nFor more information, crypto market analysis, and expert insights, visit Toobit's website at https://www.toobit.com/\n\n\n\nAbout Toobit\n\nToobit is a leading cryptocurrency platform dedicated to providing comprehensive insights, analysis, and tools for investors and enthusiasts.

        "content": "The hype around crypto seems to be fading.\n\nThe crypto market has had momentum all year, but that seems to be coming to an end as April comes to a close. The entire market has dropped, but the biggest names are leading the way.\n\nBitcoin (BTC -2.93%) has fallen 4.7% since the stock market's close on Monday, Ethereum (ETH -1.78%) is down 6.5%, and Dogecoin (DOGE -5.40%) is off 6.1%. And this continues a bad week with the tokens down 9.7%, 8.1%, and 18.2% over the past seven days.\n\nCrypto ETFs have hit saturation\n\nWhen Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit the market in the U.S., they brought billions of dollars in new investment to the industry, and Bitcoin jumped and pulled the entire market with it. But that didn't happen in Hong Kong.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were introduced in Hong Kong yesterday, and there was only $8.5 million in Bitcoin ETF trading and $2.5 billion in Ethereum ETF trading on opening day. That could indicate the appetite for crypto ETFs is fading.\n\nBinance founder's fate\n\nThe other cloud hanging over crypto is the sentencing of Binance founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao in Seattle. He pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November, but prosecutors have asked for a three-year sentence.\n\nIt's not clear what will happen to CZ, but like what happened with previous court cases and charges, the crypto industry has had to fight for both regulatory clarity and against fraud in the industry. Investors were reminded of that today.\n\nThe momentum trade may be over\n\nMore worrying for crypto investors is that the rally's driver over the past six months has now faded. Investors have been in a \"risk on\" mindset since mid-2023 and are now facing a slowing economy and the reality of higher interest rates for longer than previously expected.\n\nCrypto was supposed to be a hedge to some of these economic woes and offset the inflation brought on by money printing. Still, the reality is that crypto trades correlated with higher-risk assets like growth stocks. And many growth stocks are falling if earnings miss expectations by even a tiny amount.\n\nUnless there's a turnaround in the growth rate of the economy or the appetite for risk from investors, we may have seen a top in crypto values for a while.\n\nHow crypto can get its mojo back\n\nWhere I'm looking for growth in the next year is the utility crypto can bring to the financial market. Companies are beginning to test or use crypto and the blockchain for applications like financial payments and the issuance of bonds, which are just scratching the surface of potential use cases. But the market value is still driven more by hype and speculation than real utility.\n\nI think tokens that add utility will be the best place for long-term investments, and that may mean meme coins like Dogecoin and tokens like Bitcoin that are expensive to use to transfer funds get left in the dust. The blockchain is coming, but not all tokens will have value when it does."

        "content": "Hong Kong\u2019s debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) commenced with modest trading volumes, tallying up to 87.58 million HKD, equivalent to $11.19 million, based on Hong Kong Stock Exchange data.\n\nThis trading volume falls significantly short of the issuers\u2019 initial expectations, which anticipated volumes surpassing $100 million. Moreover, the trading volume pales compared to the US debut, where the 11-listed spot Bitcoin ETF products saw $4.6 billion in trading volume.\n\nHow they performed\n\nThe inaugural trading day showcased six newly introduced spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs issued by China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera, and HashKey.\n\nAccording to HKEX data, China Asset Management\u2019s \u201cChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF\u201d led in trading volume, clocking HK$37.16 million in turnover during the initial trading session. Its Ether ETF also secured the highest volume among the Ethereum-based ETFs with a volume of HK$12.66 million.\n\nNotably, Wu Blockchain reported that China Asset Management\u2019s Initial Offering Period scale was HK$1.1 billion, valued at approximately $142 million for both products. The Bitcoin ETF pegged at HK$950 million, while the ETH ETF pegged at HK$160 million.\n\nOther issuers like Harvest\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF recorded HK$17.89 million, while the Ether ETF garnered HK$4.95 million. Similarly, the Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF reported a volume of HK$12.44 million, and the ETH ETF stood at HK$2.48 million.\n\nThese ETFs had targeted international investors adhering to local compliance standards. By adopting this approach, the companies aimed to expand the investor base, augment liquidity, and bolster market stability. Consequently, these ETFs were accessible in various currencies, including Hong Kong dollars (HKD), US dollars, and China\u2019s Renminbi (RMB).\n\nDespite the subdued trading volume, stakeholders anticipate a significant market impact. Gabor Gurbacs, the founder of crypto-related firm PointsVille, said:\n\n\u201cThe East-West Bitcoin ETF competition is heating up. Hong Kong wouldn\u2019t launch Bitcoin ETFs without China\u2019s approval. China is determined to put up competition on institutional Bitcoin capabilities. Full nation state adoption game theory in effect.\u201d\n\nMentioned in this article"

The investigation involved sending subpoenas to various individuals and entities that have dealt with the Ethereum token.\n\nThe Fox Business report says that the SEC was adamant about making sure that the investigation remained a secret, with one source comparing their experience to being forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The parties that received the subpoenas were supposed to remain mum about them if they wanted to get further information about the probe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsurprisingly, Consensus, the key Ethereum backer, was among the firms that had to deal with subpoenas from the SEC.\n\nAfter filing its lawsuit against the SEC, Consensys revealed that it had received a Wells notice from the regulator earlier this April.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has repeatedly refused to answer whether or not Ethereum is an unregistered security. He also dodged this question from Congressman Patrick McHenry during a congressional hearing back in April 2023. Notably, the SEC voted to approve the investigation into Ethereum just days after the hearing took place.\n\nThe SEC's hostile stance toward Ethereum does not come as a surprise. In a recent interview with New York Magazine, the SEC boss hinted that the token could be classified as an unregistered security.\n\nGensler previously recognized Ether as a non-security during his MIT days, but Ethereum's long-awaited transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism likely dramatically altered his view."

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Hit $10,000 If The SEC Changes Tune? - CoinGape",
        "content": "The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US in January this year broadened the outlook of the crypto market for most investors. Attention quickly shifted to Ethereum with companies swiftly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer spot ETH ETFs. For a short while, Ethereum price surged alongside Bitcoin price. Although the latter achieved a new all-time high of $73,837 according to data by CoinGape and CoinGecko, ETH topped out at $4,091.\n\nEthereum Price Market Update As Volatility Rages\n\nThe post-Bitcoin halving crypto environment remains in a precarious state. An initial climb in crypto prices waned, paving the way for the current correction. Bitcoin price changed at $60,715 on Tuesday during US hours, painting a 3.5% drop in the last 24 hours.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto had been hammered the most, losing a modest 5.6% of its value to $2,984. A 6.6% fall in the market cap to $361 billion reflects the intense sell-off in April while the 8% spike in the 24-hour trading volume hints at the growing interest in Ether among traders.\n\nLosing support at $3,000 exposes Ethereum price to more selling pressure at the outset of May. The position of the smart contract token below two bull market indicators \u2014 the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 50-day EMA (blue and red lines on the chart) could further trigger more declines this week.\n\nA death cross pattern confirmed on April 17 when the 20-day EMA flipped beneath the 50-day EMA is another bearish signal that\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\nSimilarly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that sellers have more influence at the time of writing. Therefore, it would be imperative to anticipate continued losses to $2,800, and if push comes to shove $2,500.\n\nDespite the correction, the RSI is not oversold, suggesting that there\u2019s room for more downward movement.\n\nNevertheless, the same four-hour chart brings attention to a wedge pattern. If Ethereum price rebounds before breaking below the lower trendline support, chances of a targeted recovery will increase significantly.\n\nA falling wedge is considered a bullish pattern occurring after a substantial surge in the price of an asset followed by a drop, or consolidation. As the trendlines narrow, bulls fight to retake control.\n\nTraders will look for a breakout above the upper trend line, which often points to a breakout target equal to the distance between the widest points of the pattern. A 24% increase in price could drastically change Ethereum\u2019s outlook.\n\nIs Ethereum A Security?\n\nUS Regulators are undecided on Ethereum\u2019s status \u2014 whether a security or a cryptocurrency. With the expectations of a spot ETF gaining momentum, this determination is crucial and likely to set a precedent for many digital assets.\n\nA recent report by Fox Business producer Eleanor Terret revealed that Gary Gensler and the agency he heads, the SEC believed that Ethereum passed as security, but only for some time.\n\nThis revelation comes amid the ongoing Consensys lawsuit against the SEC. In the report, Terret said that Gensler and the SEC \u201cappear to have believed for at least a year\u201d that Ethereum was an \u201cunregistered security trading out of compliance with current federal regulations.\u201d\n\nAn investigation dubbed \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d is being carried out by the SEC intending to unearth details of Ethereum being a security, especially on the sales of Ether from 2018.\n\nFormer executives of the SEC like Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman are on record stating that Ethereum was not a security. Hence, the ongoing investigation could throw this stance in the wind, further opening a can of worms for the SEC.\n\nOn the other hand, if the \u201cEthereum 2.0\u201d investigation affirms Ether\u2019s status as a cryptocurrency, it could potentially bolster its position in the industry.\n\nAt the very least, it will increase the probability of spot Ethereum ETFs approval \u2014 a move that could blast ETH price above the previous all-time high. A clear path could also be opened for Ethereum to close the gap to $10,000 bolstered by increased adoption among retail and institutional investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJohn Isige John is a seasoned crypto expert, renowned for his in-depth analysis and accurate price predictions in the digital asset market.

        "title": "Solana Vs Ethereum : Will Solana Take Over Ethereum By End of 2024 ? - CoinGape",
        "content": "Amid crypto market crash following Bitcoin halving, Solana and Ethereum show different levels of performance. Solana\u2019s annual increase of 480.53% contrasts with Ethereum\u2019s decrease of 66.68%. During the previous week, Solana had a drop of 12.05%, whereas Ethereum had a smaller decrease of 1.06%. This article will analyze their most recent market performance, evaluating their potential paths in the current crypto environment and examining if Solana is positioned to surpass Ethereum.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Current Price Market Performance\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the continuous battle between Solana and Ethereum, the market performance illustrates two powerful entities maneuvering through the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Solana\u2019s native token SOL is currently at $135.08, showing a 4.50% decrease in value in the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, taking a broader perspective reveals a more detailed story, with SOL undergoing a 12.05% decrease in the week and a significant 27.45% drop in the month.\n\nEven with some temporary obstacles, the token has seen a remarkable increase of 480.53% in the last year, showing its ability to bounce back and remain popular among investors.\n\nIn comparison, Ethereum, along with its famous token ETH, holds a higher value of $3,164.16. However, similar to its opposite, it is dealing with recent changes, showing a 3.84% drop during the day. Nevertheless, Ethereum\u2019s overall trend indicates a more stable path, with only a 1.06% drop in the week and a 10.75% decrease in the month.\n\nSignificantly, ETH has shown a 66.68% decline in value in the last year, highlighting the difficulties encountered in the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nDigging further, Solana\u2019s market capitalization of $6.4 billion places it in the 5th position among cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap. On the flip side, Ethereum boasts a market cap of $386.2 billion, establishing itself as the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nEven though they have different market capitalizations, both platforms show strong trading activity, with Solana seeing $1.98 billion in 24-hour volume and Ethereum reporting $13.5 billion.\n\nAnalyzing price movements, Solana\u2019s recent changes had it moving between $133.96 and $143.78 in a day, whereas Ethereum traded within the range of $3,152.95 to $3,351.18. Both tokens reflect their highest values in the past, with Solana reaching $260.06 two years ago, showing a decline of 48.24%, and Ethereum peaking at $4,891.70, currently experiencing a decrease of 35.54%.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, operating as an open-source blockchain system with its own digital currency called Ether (ETH). Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum allows for the execution of Decentralized Smart Contracts. The project was funded through a public crowd sale in 2014, leading to the official launch of the blockchain in 2015.\n\nEthereum aims to be the global hub for decentralized applications (Dapps), enabling programmers to create and run software without censorship or downtime. The concept of \u201csmart contracts\u201d was pioneered by Ethereum, with co-founder Gavin Wood envisioning it as \u201cone computer for the entire planet.\u201d Recent upgrades like the London Hard Fork and the Dencun Upgrade have brought scaling efficiencies and lower transaction costs to the platform.\n\nWhat Is Solana?\n\nThe Solana project, initiated in 2017 and formally launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation, is an open-source platform leveraging blockchain technology for cost-effective DeFi solutions with a focus on speed. Its protocol supports DApp development through smart contract deployment on its blockchain, aiming to enhance scalability with a mix of PoH and PoS consensus mechanisms.\n\nWith SOL crypto priced at $104.69 on March 2, 2022, and reaching an ATH of $260.06 on November 6, 2021, Solana\u2019s efficient model enables swift payment verification at low costs, providing a USP in the crypto industry. The innovative hybrid consensus ensures accessibility for all traders, aligning with the Foundation\u2019s goal of broadening decentralized finance access.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Key Features\n\nSolana\u2019s unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, combined with Proof-of-Stake validation, allows it to process significantly more transactions per second than Ethereum. The platform provides each node with its clock and decision-making ability. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm protects the system from disruptions, ensuring overall functionality. Solana supports multiple smart contracts running simultaneously, enhancing platform efficiency and versatility within its ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum features smart contracts encoded into code for self-execution, enabling the creation of decentralized applications on its blockchain. Its native crypto is used for transactions and rewarding miners. With a Turing-complete virtual machine, Ethereum executes smart contracts for various applications and allows for the formation of DAOs, governed by code and consensus.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum: Latest News\n\nA potential spot Ethereum ETF could be on the horizon now that spot Bitcoin ETFs are no longer the focus, expected in May. Nevertheless, the schedule for this has not been determined yet, as the SEC has remained silent about the matter.\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade was successfully launched on the mainnet on March 13, 2024, following its deployment on all the Ethereum testnets. This is a significant advancement in the Ethereum network and a crucial step towards Ethereum 2.0.\n\nOn the other hand Solana received the Crypto of the Year award for its SOL token from CoinMarketCap, recognizing its growth and resilience. This milestone showcases its success among other notable projects in the industry.\n\nFurthermore, Solana-focused devshop Anza has released an update to fix the intermittent congestion issues and expects a sound recovery in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nConclusion: Will Solana Overtake Ethereum?\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum are significant players in the world of cryptocurrency. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, continues to advance with upgrades like the Dencun Upgrade. Meanwhile, Solana has quickly gained recognition, even winning the Crypto of the Year award. The question remains whether Solana will surpass Ethereum by 2024. Solana\u2019s scalability and capabilities make it a strong competitor, but Ethereum\u2019s established environment and continuous updates suggest it will maintain its dominance. The competition between Solana and Ethereum is expected to continue as new technologies, market factors, and regulations evolve."

        "content": "Amid the ongoing regulatory question regarding the second largest cryptocurrency, new court filings reveal that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been investigating Ethereum since 2023. Indeed, the filings show that chairman Gary Gensler and the agency have been seeking to challenge the asset\u2019s security status for a year.\n\nEthereum software firm Consensys filed a lawsuit against the SEC last week. However, they paint an interesting picture of how the agency has viewed the cryptocurrency. Specifically, they note that it has been building a case against the asset since early 2023. Conversely, development is vital as the agency is facing a plethora of Spot Ethereum ETF applications.\n\nJUST IN: \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC has been investigating Ethereum since March 2023, new court filing reveals. April 29, 2024\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum May Price Prediction: Can ETH Hit $4,000?\n\nSEC Has Been Seeking to Challenge ETH Security Status Since 2023\n\nThe digital asset market has faced an ever-changing regulatory landscape. Indeed, United States investors have struggled with a lack of clarity in this area regarding the industry. This is in large part due to the SEC and its ongoing enforcement-first approach to regulation.\n\nNow, revealed court filings show that the SEC has been investigating Ethereum since March 2023. Specifically, the agency has reportedly been building a case to challenge ETH\u2019s security status for more than a year.\n\nAccording to reports, the SEC director of the Division of Enforcement, Gurbir Grewal, approved an investigation order in March of last year. That allows the agency to investigate both the buying and selling of Ethereum. The presence of a formal order of investigation allowed the SEC to issue subpoenas and gather witness testimony under oath.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAlso Read: SEC Sued Over Ethereum, Prosecutors Say ETH Isn\u2019t A Security\n\nThe revelation explains why Gensler had previously refused to answer if Ethereum was a commodity or security at a recent Congressional testimony. According to Consensys, Gensler \u201cdid not want to admit that his SEC had already secretly cemented its power-grab\u201d through the investigation order.\n\nThe SEC has been known to target specific digital assets by referring to them as securities in filed lawsuits against cryptocurrency exchanges. In 2023\u2019s lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, more than ten assets were named security. However, ETH was not included among them."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent development that has sent ripples across the crypto market, a notable Ethereum (ETH) whale has reportedly initiated a sell-off of a significant amount of the digital asset, totaling a staggering $38 million. The event, highlighted by Lookonchain via X, sheds light on the intricate dynamics within the crypto space, particularly concerning market sentiment and the actions of influential investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tweet by Lookonchain, the whale's decision to offload 11,892 ETH, equivalent to $38 million, onto the Binance exchange for sale, has sparked widespread attention and speculation. Notably, this move follows a series of trading activities by the whale, who had previously taken long positions on Ethereum futures. However, the recent deposit for sale marks a significant reversal in their trading strategy, suggesting a shift in sentiment or a reevaluation of market conditions.\n\nAfter the price of $ETH dropped, the whale gave up on long $ETH and deposited all 11,892 $ETH($38M) to #Binance for sale, making ~$217K.\n\n\n\nThis whale has gone long $ETH 3 times since Mar 20, 2 of them were losses, with a total loss of ~$4.63M.https://t.co/SCUoiUoFvz pic.twitter.com/egDBflIHgd \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 29, 2024\n\nThe tweet further elucidates the whale's trading history, revealing that since March 20, the individual had undertaken long positions on Ethereum futures on three separate occasions. However, two of these instances resulted in losses, amounting to a cumulative deficit of approximately $4.63 million. This sequence of events underscores the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets and the inherent risks associated with trading strategies, even for seasoned investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum price struggles continue\n\nMeanwhile, the broader Ethereum market has been grappling with its own set of challenges. As of the latest data available, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,178, reflecting a decline of 3.86% over the past 24 hours. This downward movement in price underscores the prevailing bearish sentiment that has gripped the crypto landscape in recent sessions, with Ethereum mirroring the broader market trend."

        "title": "Gensler Lied to Congress About Ethereum, Says Rep. McHenry - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nChairman of the House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry (R-NC) waded into the escalating feud between financial regulators and the crypto industry on Tuesday, accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of having \u201cmisled Congress\u201d regarding the agency\u2019s stance on Ethereum.\n\nMcHenry\u2019s comments come following the revelation that the SEC has internally considered Ethereum (ETH) to be an unregistered security for over a year, according to unredacted portions of a lawsuit filed against the regulator by Ethereum software company Consensys.\n\nIn the intervening period, Gensler has repeatedly refused to comment about the SEC\u2019s position on Ethereum, which is second only to Bitcoin among crypto assets by market capitalization. During a contentious round of questioning from McHenry on the subject during a congressional hearing on April 18 last year, Gensler evaded direct questions about whether the SEC considers ETH to be a security.\n\nAccording to Consensys\u2019s lawsuit filed last week against the regulator, the SEC had only five days earlier, on April 13, approved a formal order authorizing agency staff to issue subpoenas related to the offer and sale of numerous crypto assets, including ETH. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNew evidence shows Chair Gensler himself misled Congress,\u201d McHenry said of Gensler\u2019s testimony last year in a statement released today. \u201cNew court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the Commission\u2019s position.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that a formal order from the SEC, like the kind referenced in the Consensys lawsuit, isn\u2019t meant to represent a legal conclusion and is often just one of the first steps in an investigation, according to a source familiar with the mater.\n\n#ICYMI: New court filings indicate that @SECGov Chair Gary Gensler knowingly misled Congress when pressed on the classification of #ETH at a @FinancialCmte hearing to conduct oversight of his agency. \ud83d\udcd6 Read my full statement \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/8osMpbY6Iu \u2014 Patrick McHenry (@PatrickMcHenry) April 30, 2024\n\nMcHenry in his statement today went on to deride the apparent disconnect between the SEC\u2019s public words and private actions on ETH as an example of the \u201carbitrary and capricious nature of the agency\u2019s regulation by enforcement approach to digital assets.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShortly after issuing the strongly worded statement, McHenry\u2019s office announced a hearing, set for next week, on the Financial Services Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Capital Markets, titled \u201cSEC Enforcement: Balancing Deterrence with Due Process.\u201d\n\nDecrypt reached out to McHenry\u2019s office regarding the purpose of the hearing but did not immediately receive a response."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, represented mainly by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), is facing new challenges arising from global macroeconomic conditions, here is a price analysis.\n\nThe unexpected increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States in April and the decline in GDP in the first quarter reflect an evolving financial context that could negatively impact the price of major cryptocurrencies.\n\nImpact of Global Liquidity Tightening on the Analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices\n\nRyan Lee, analyst at Bitget, highlights that the global liquidity squeeze could have a significant impact on the performance of BTC and ETH in the month of May.\n\nWith the reduction of the FED\u2019s net liquidity, the market expects an average performance for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u201cLooking at the options market, the implied volatility of BTC and ETH has dropped from highs of 78% in April to around 58%, with a more significant reduction for options expiring at the end of May,\u201d\n\nobserve Lee.\n\nThis indicates that options market traders predict a low probability of a significant turnaround in the next month.\n\nWhile interest rates in the USA continue to rise, suppressing demand in the real estate sector and showing a direct influence on existing home sales, the cryptocurrency market is feeling this pressure.\n\nLee predicts a possible correction for BTC and ETH in May, followed by a volatile recovery.\n\nAccording to the analyst, BTC could fluctuate between $56,000 and $68,000, while ETH, influenced by events such as the launch of ETFs on Ethereum, could show greater volatility, fluctuating between $2,600 and $3,600.\n\nOther experts in the field share similar opinions, but with variations in short-term expectations. Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA, comments that \u201cthe strength of the US dollar and the increase in interest rates could continue to put pressure on cryptocurrencies, which traditionally benefit from a high liquidity environment.\u201d\n\nThe Influence of Macroeconomic Conditions on Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe behavior of cryptocurrencies in a climate of rising interest rates and a strong dollar raises significant questions about their role as \u201csafe haven\u201d assets. Traditionally, assets like gold have been preferred by investors during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\nHowever, with the evolution of the global financial context, cryptocurrencies have also started to be perceived as possible alternatives. \u201cCryptocurrencies have shown remarkable resilience in times of economic turbulence, which could strengthen their appeal as an alternative investment in times of uncertainty,\u201d notes Jennifer Liu, market analyst at CoinDesk.\n\nThis point of view is supported by a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in various economic sectors, increasing their legitimacy and potential for stability.\n\nLooking to the future, technological innovation in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrencies continues to play a crucial role.\n\nWith the introduction of new features, such as improving the energy efficiency of mining operations and developing more user-friendly platforms, cryptocurrencies are trying to overcome some of the main critical issues that limit their adoption on a large scale. \u201cThe technological aspect cannot be underestimated,\u201d says Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FxPro.\n\n\u201cInnovations such as Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake are indicators of the potential of these technologies not only as speculative assets, but as long-term sustainable solutions to various global problems.\u201d\n\nWith these ongoing developments, investors are encouraged to stay informed and proactive. Market conditions can change rapidly, and having a deep understanding of both economic dynamics and technological innovations can provide a significant advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, while macroeconomic challenges pose uncertainties, the adaptability and advancement of cryptocurrencies offer a window into a future where they can emerge as pillars of a new financial paradigm."

        "content": "A new report suggests SEC Chairman Gary Gensler believes Ethereum (ETH) was a security for the last 12 months. An April 29 Fox Business report states that Gensler believed for at least a year that Ethereum was an unregistered security. This is in contrast to the previous positions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Ethereum\u2019s status as a commodity.\n\nAccording to the report, a new court document filed today may provide more insights into the timeframe behind the Commission\u2019s alleged grouping of Ethereum as a security. If the newly launched investigations point to Ethereum as a security, it contradicts previous statements by the financial regulator.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cThe new documents, filed Monday morning, have yet to be reported. They provide insight into the timeline behind the SEC\u2019s thinking regarding Ethereum\u2019s alleged status as a security, and shed light on what has been perhaps the biggest question facing the $2 trillion digital asset industry about the regulatory status of a cryptocurrency that is held by millions of investors.\u201d\n\nConsensys At The Center of New Filings\n\nAfter the receipt of the SEC\u2019s Wells Notice, Consensys filed a lawsuit in a Texas court alleging a shift from the Commision\u2019s previous position amongst others.\n\nThe company alleged the SEC trying to seize control of the cryptocurrency industry. In 2018, the SEC noted that the second-largest cryptocurrency was not a security. This opened up claims of favoritism in the aftermath of the Ripple saga with the Commission.\n\nConsensys claims this position led individuals and firms to take new ventures which would be unfair to make a switch. Furthermore, the company argued this move will bring the blockchain industry to a halt in the United States.\n\nHow Ethereum Saga Can Affect Crypto\n\nETH is the second largest asset by market capitalization while the Ethereum blockchain hosts the largest amount of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nWith a surge in DeFi numbers, a move by the SEC on Ethereum could cripple the industry\u2019s growth. The effects on the price could be massive as bulls set sights on retesting the $4,000 mark in the next bull run.\n\nExperts opine on possible effects from traditional finance due to the anticipation of spot Ethereum\u2019s ETFs in the United States amongst some wealth managers bullish on its staking feature.\n\nAlso Read: Breaking: EigenLayer Floats EIGEN Token Whitepaper On GitHub\n\nDavid Pokima David is a finance news contributor with 4 years of experience in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies.

Discover SCENE\n\nThe six new spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong saw more than $80 million Hong Kong Dollars (HKD)\u2014roughly $10 million\u2014worth of shares traded on their debut Tuesday, according to Hong Kong Exchange data.\n\nThat makes Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, the first in Asia to allow the trading of spot virtual asset ETFs. Hong Kong Exchange noted in a press release that investor interest in virtual asset ETFs has grown since funds based on digital asset futures were first launched in late 2022. Experts have been projecting that the introduction of the new spot ETFs could bring upwards of $25 billion into the market, should they be opened up to mainland Chinese investors.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the combined average daily turnover (ADT) for the three futures ETFs was $51.3 million HKD ($6.5 million), according to the exchange, up from $8.9 million HKD ($1 million) during the same time in 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo relatively speaking, the six new spot funds have already outperformed their fast-growing Bitcoin and Ethereum futures counterparts among Hong Kong traders. But the new spot ETFs have made a much smaller splash than U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs made when they began trading in January.\n\nBREAKING:\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0 HONG KONG BECOMES FIRST IN ASIA TO LAUNCH SPOT #BITCOIN ETF pic.twitter.com/WrorFD4lmm \u2014 Simply Bitcoin (@SimplyBitcoinTV) April 30, 2024\n\nOn their long-awaited debut, the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.5 billion worth of trading. As of this writing, the U.S. ETFs have custodied more than 215,000 BTC\u2014worth approximately $11.9 billion at today's prices\u2014to back their outstanding shares.\n\nHarvest Global Investments, China Asset Mangement, and Bosera and Hashkey each now offer a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. In broad strokes, the Bitcoin ETFs outperformed their Ethereum counterparts by the time markets closed in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETFs shares gained about 2% in their first day while the Ethereum ETFs lost about 0.5% by the time trading closed in Hong Kong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new Bitcoin funds\u2014Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (HGI BTC), Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF (BOS HSK BTC), and the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (CAM BTC)\u2014saw for $7.85 worth of turnover by the time markets closed.\n\nChinaAMC's fund dominated on its first day of trading, accounting for 57% of all the Bitcoin ETF turnover. The Harvest ETF made up 29% and the Bosera Hashkey fund saw made up the rest.\n\nAmong the three Ethereum funds\u2014all from the same issuers\u2014the split was roughly the same. ChinaAMC's fund was responsible for 65% of the day one turnover, Harvest for another 25%, and Bosera Hashkey made up the rest."

        "title": "Solana and Ethereum Smart Contract Audits Explained - LCX",
        "content": "Ethereum Smart Contract Security Audit\n\nEthereum, the pioneer of smart contract platforms, has been the go-to choice for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts for several years. However, its success has also made it a prime target for attackers. Here are some key points to consider regarding Ethereum smart contract security audits:\n\nSolidity Language: Ethereum smart contracts are typically written in Solidity, a specialized programming language. Solidity has a rich set of tools and libraries for developers, but it can be prone to vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflow.\n\nOpenZeppelin: OpenZeppelin, a popular open-source framework, provides standardized contracts and libraries to help developers build secure Ethereum smart contracts. These pre-audited components reduce the risk of coding errors.\n\nAuditing Firms: Ethereum smart contracts are often audited by specialized firms that focus on blockchain security. These audits help identify vulnerabilities and suggest fixes before deployment.\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum is home to numerous DAOs, which are organizations governed by smart contracts. DAO security has been a major concern, as vulnerabilities in these contracts can lead to large-scale theft.\n\nEthereum 2.0: The transition to Ethereum 2.0, which includes a shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, is expected to enhance security and scalability.\n\nHow Does an Ethereum Smart Contract Audit Work?\n\nThe finest security companies will subject their code to stress tests to determine how it performs in a variety of situations. According to experts, it is essential for a project to provide a comprehensive and explicit technical specification and, ideally, documentation of the deployment process.\n\nThese audits aim not only to identify vulnerabilities that black hat hackers could exploit but also defects that could prevent an Ethereum smart contract from functioning properly. The attack vectors under investigation can become quite technical, but they include replay attacks, in which malignant actors repeatedly transmit valid data in order to conduct fraudulent activities. Other attacks include reentrancy, reordering, and brief address attacks.\n\nOnce an investigation has been completed, crypto projects receive a detailed report of the vulnerabilities within their code, along with recommendations on how to mitigate their impact or eradicate them altogether. Therefore, the resources conserved by an effective audit can significantly outweigh the cost. Moreover, it can prevent reputational injury.\n\nSolana Smart Contract Security Audit\n\nSolana, a newer entrant in the blockchain space, has gained popularity for its high-speed and low-cost transactions. When it comes to Solana smart contract security audits, here are some key considerations:\n\nRust Programming Language: Solana smart contracts are typically written in Rust, a programming language known for its safety features. Rust\u2019s memory safety and other design choices reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities.\n\nProgram Library: Solana provides a standard library for writing smart contracts, which includes built-in functions to ensure security. This library encourages best practices in contract development.\n\nProgram Analysis Tools: Solana offers various program analysis tools and a developer-friendly environment, making it easier for developers to identify and fix issues.\n\nCommunity Auditing: The Solana community actively participates in auditing smart contracts. While this approach may lack the formality of third-party audits, it fosters a collaborative environment focused on security.\n\nInteroperability: Solana\u2019s interoperability with other blockchains and its support for cross-chain communication introduce new security challenges that need careful consideration.\n\nAre Solana Smart Contract Audits Different?\n\nAudits of smart contracts will vary marginally based on the blockchain code they are based on. Common security flaws in Solana can include omitted ownership checks, allowing attackers to circumvent access controls using spoofed configurations.\n\nAnd while smart contracts can call functions from external smart contracts, validation failures may allow black hat hackers to inject malicious inputs that influence the operation of the code. Top auditing firms will evaluate a Solana smart contract based on the quality of its documentation, security, architecture, and code. Additionally, vulnerabilities are designated severity levels, allowing business-critical issues to be addressed first.\n\nHow Do Smart Contract Audits Benefit Crypto Projects?\n\nAudits are essential for ironing out any bugs in a crypto project and ensuring that the code is suitable for widespread use. In 78 incidents during the first quarter of 2022 alone, hackers stole $1.33 billion; two-thirds of these attacks were on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. But how could a smart contract audit have assisted them?\n\nWell, common causes include crypto initiatives that prioritize speed over a comprehensive audit from a reputable service provider. They may also rely on internal teams to conduct security reviews. While this appears fiscally prudent, there is a risk that internal personnel are not up to date on the most recent cyber techniques used by malicious actors. Unavoidably, some will also believe that they are invincible. But complacency is the greatest enemy in the crypto space, and even the best initiatives can be hacked.\n\nHow Much Do Smart Contract Audits Cost?\n\nThe cost depends on how complex the smart contract is. According to Hacken, this can increase to $500,000 for larger initiatives with more lines of code, not to mention the additional engineering hours required. The company contends that these expenses pale in contrast to the economic harm that a smart contract vulnerability can cause.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how smart contract audits can make a difference: an audit uncovered at least one critical bug in 80% of initiatives. However, according to Hacken, only 75% of organizations have completely acted on an audit report in the past, with the remainder ignoring the conclusions or considering only a small number of recommendations. As a consequence, their security score was lower.\n\nHow Long Do Smart Contract Audits Take?\n\nIt is a process that requires several weeks, depending on the speed at which a crypto project operates. Initial audits typically take between 2 and 14 days, depending on the complexity and scale of a smart contract. These investigations can be expedited if necessary. Again, larger protocols may take longer, up to 30 days in some instances.\n\nDo Smart Contract Audits Improve Crypto\u2019s Image?\n\nBlockchain technology is becoming a bigger part of all our lives \u2014 and auditors ensure that crypto initiatives put their best foot forward. Improving the quality of smart contracts reduces negative press coverage of significant hacks and enhances the reputation of crypto projects in the eyes of the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth Solana and Ethereum offer unique approaches to smart contract security. Ethereum, with its longer history, has established formalized auditing processes and a robust ecosystem of tools and libraries. On the other hand, Solana\u2019s emphasis on safety through the Rust programming language and community engagement is a promising step towards ensuring secure smart contracts.\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, security remains a top priority. Developers and organizations must carefully consider the trade-offs and security features of each platform when choosing where to deploy their smart contracts. As both Solana and Ethereum continue to evolve, the blockchain community can look forward to even more robust security measures and best practices for smart contracts.\n\nIn conclusion, the security of smart contracts is an ongoing concern, and it\u2019s essential for blockchain developers and organizations to stay vigilant, adopt best practices, and adapt to the changing landscape of blockchain security to protect valuable assets and ensure the trust of users and investors."

        "title": "Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Relief wave on altcoins likely as BTC shows a $5,000 range - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price could drop into the liquidity pool between $60,600 and $59,005 as it establishes $65,600 as weekly resistance.\n\nEthereum price could confirm a falling wedge pattern with a 25% run above $3,406 at breakout point.\n\nRipple price defends $0.5000 but overhanging bearish activity will keep XRP holders\u2019 vision for $0.6000 a hopium pipe dream.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has recorded lower highs over the past seven days, with a similar outlook witnessed among altcoins. Meanwhile, while altcoins display a rather disturbing outlook amid a broader market bleed, there could be some relief soon as fundamentals show:\n\nA massive cool off in euphoria and sentiment\n\nA cool-off phase allows the market to correct itself, stabilize, and establish a more sustainable growth trajectory.\n\nA healthy outlook in funding rates\n\nHealthy funding rates indicate a well-functioning and balanced market ecosystem, promoting stability, reducing the risk of manipulation, and fostering confidence among market participants.\n\nOverleveraged short positions are waiting to get liquidated\n\nWhile the initial liquidation of overleveraged short positions may lead to short-term volatility, the eventual impact can often be positive for the price of an asset.\n\nRead More: Week Ahead: Bitcoin could surprise investors this week\n\nBitcoin price forms a $5,000 range\n\nAfter successive weekly closes below $65,600, and with the bulls defending against a dip below $60,000, Bitcoin price has established a $5,000 macro market range. The odds hint at a further decline given the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is subdued below the mean level of 50 and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator continues to post red histograms in negative territory.\n\nIf seller momentum increases and Bitcoin price dips into the liquidity pool between $60,600 and the intra-day low of March 5 at $59,005, the downtrend could continue with bulls waiting to buy BTC just above the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nConversely, if history repeats, Bitcoin price could move in the opposite direction as the DXY Compare indicator. To confirm the continuation of the uptrend, however, the bulls must haul BTC above $72,000 because plenty of bearish activity awaits BTC price near the $70,000 threshold.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Price Outlook: Will BTC ignore major macro market developments this week?\n\nEthereum price could rally 25%, pending confirmation\n\nEthereum price is trading with a bearish bias, but not for long as the price action since March 12 has consolidated into a descending wedge pattern. The execution of this bullish reversal technical formation will happen after a decisive breakout above the upper trendline on the one-day timeframe.\n\nThe target objective for this pattern is a 25% move toward $4,250, determined by measuring the heath of the wedge and superimposing it at the expected breakout point.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to wind around the mean level of 50, while the AO indicator shows growing bullish sentiment displayed by the green histograms that draw toward positive territory.\n\nThe higher highs seen on the RSI chart since mid-April relative to the lower highs in ETH price also support the bullish thesis, suggesting a bullish divergence. If the RSI flips above the mean level, it would tilt the odds further in favor of a bullish breakout.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if ETH bears have their way and book profits for the nearly 10% gains made since Ethereum price bounced from the $2,900 support, the market would see a correction. A candlestick close below $2,900 would invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum fees drops to lowest level since October, ETH sustains above $3,200\n\nRipple price suffers the weight of overhanging bearish pressure\n\nRipple downside potential remains very much alive with bearish activity waiting to descend on XRP price once it lifts. This is seen with the multiple spikes on the volume profile (grey) in the one-day chart below. The RSI is also declining steadily, showing falling momentum.\n\nThis, coupled with the red histogram bars that remain in negative territory reinforce the bearish outlook. If the $0.5000 psychological support is lost, Ripple price could drop all the way to the $0.4500 threshold, or in a dire case, extend the fall to the bottom of the market range at $0.4188, nearly 20% below current levels.\n\nXRP/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the flip side, if XRP bulls show up, Ripple price could recover. For the bearish thesis to be invalidated, however, the price must record a candlestick close above $0.6500. This is because massive bearish activity awaits the payments token in the area surrounding $0.6000 as XRP bears wait to cash in.\n\nAlso Read: XRP slides to $0.50 as ETHgate controversy resurfaces, Ripple CTO debates impact on litigation"

Bitcoin\u2019s current price momentum could be linked to low demand from Spot ETFs and negative sentiment among investors expecting a potential post-halving crash,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.\"$59,600 is an important level bulls need to defend to prevent further downsides. A strong break and close above $65,000 could clear the path for a rise to $68,000 and then to $71,000,\" said Thakral.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"There seems to be a bearish trend forming for BTC, and we can expect some slow-moving days ahead. Immediate resistance is around $63.4k.\"Other major crypto tokens such as BNB (-2.2%), Solana (-5.2%), XRP (-3.4%), Dogecoin (-5%), Toncoin (-4.7%), Polkadot (-5.2%), Shiba Inu (-5.3%), and Avalanche (-4.4%) also declined.The volume of all stablecoins is now $52.74 billion, which is 90.58% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, declined to $1.227 trillion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 53.15%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 19.3% to $21 billion.Regarding the future price movements of cryptocurrencies, the CoinDCX Research Team noted, \"This week's macroeconomic events, such as the Fed's fund rate and unemployment rate announcements, could potentially increase market volatility.\"On the technical front, Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"Bitcoin has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000 level since a while now.

        "title": "Why Ethereum\u2019s run to $3.3K may be false breakout for ETH\u2019s price - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Resistance at $3,353 could force ETH to decline to $3,120.\n\nIn the midterm, the price might fail to surpass $4,000.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] rise to $3,300 on the 28th of April returned optimism to the market. However, according to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis, the joy market participants might have had could be momentary.\n\nOne reason for this prediction could be linked to a recent transaction. In the early hours of the same day, a participant sent 14,999 ETH to the Coinbase exchange.\n\nWhile we have not been able to track who the exact culprit was, the transfer could affect ETH\u2019s price. This is because a large number of coins sent to exchange usually end up in a sale.\n\nAlso, depending on the volume, the sale could stop the value from moving higher.\n\nHigh liquidity comes with resistance\n\nHence, it could be that ETH\u2019s surge in the last 24 hours was a false breakout.\n\nFor context, a false breakout is terminology that explains how a cryptocurrency tries to break certain resistance but loses momentum afterward.\n\nWithout looking at other indicators, this conclusion might sound too hasty. Hence, AMBCrypto decided to examine other parts of the market related to the altcoin.\n\nOne indicator we gauged was the liquidation heatmap. For most people, the liquidation heatmap helps to track high liquidity in the order book.\n\nHowever, the same indicator can be instrumental in identifying support and resistance zones. From the data above, there was a concentration of liquidity at $3,353.\n\nIn areas like this, large trades can be executed at relatively good prices. But as soon as orders enter this liquidity, the price might reverse. As such, the $3,353 region could be a resistance point for ETH.\n\n$4K is not close\n\nMoving on, the value of the cryptocurrency might drop once it hits the price mentioned above. However, support lied at $3,276, indicating that ETH might not slip below the level.\n\nThe next part we considered was the Cumulative Liquidation Levels Delta (CLLD). If positive, the CLLD indicates that there are more long liquidations.\n\nOn the other hand, a negative CLLD suggests that short liquidations were more than longs. As of this writing, the CLLD was positive. But this indicator also has a say on the price.\n\nWith the press time position, the CLLD indicated that ETH could undergo a full retrace. Should this be the case, the price of the cryptocurrency might drop to $3,120.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIn the meantime, the price of the cryptocurrency might keep its head above $3,300 for some time. However, expecting this increase to drive ETH to $4,000 might be a stretch.\n\nOur assessment showed that the market lacked enough firepower to drive such a hike. In addition, expecting the altcoin to surpass its all-time high might not be an option anytime soon."

        "content": "Trading volumes in crypto have plummeted to January lows.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices have declined slightly, impacting market activity.\n\nThe crypto market is witnessing a significant lull, with trading volumes dropping to levels not seen since the start of the year.\n\nThis downturn accompanies a noticeable decrease in the prices of major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] shedding 4.6% and 0.3% respectively over the past week.\n\nAs of the latest data, Bitcoin hovered around $62,858 while Ethereum traded at approximately $3,141.\n\nOn the 30th of April, market intelligence platform Santiment, via an X (formerly Twitter) post, reported that this decline in trading activity aligned with a broader sentiment of uncertainty among traders.\n\nThe once-popular rallying cry to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d has quieted, and the bullish chatter that typically accompanies hopeful market cycles has notably diminished.\n\nMoreover, a significant portion of the market is holding onto their assets, driven by the \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on any potential recovery rallies.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Future possibilities\n\nThis market behavior has led to a stark consolidation period for Bitcoin, where neither significant upsides nor sharp declines are being observed.\n\nSantiment highlighted this period of indecision, noting that the current situation is characterized by a lack of selling, underpinned by traders\u2019 reluctance to miss out on potential gains.\n\nThe platform also suggested keeping an eye out for a surge in trading volume, which could signal a forthcoming market-wide rally as the calendar turns to May.\n\nThe recent drop in Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume is a stark reminder of the diminished market enthusiasm. From highs of over $23 billion last week, trading volumes have plummeted to just under $20 billion.\n\nThis decrease is likely a cooling-off from the fervor generated by the recent Bitcoin halving and the inflow into ETFs, which are now showing signs of waning interest.\n\nData from Farside investors indicated that Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a modest inflow of $51.6 million on the 29th of April\u2014a sharp decline from previous months.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAs the hype surrounding major catalysts like Bitcoin\u2019s halving and ETFs dissipates, the market is left in a state of anticipation for the next big wave.\n\nThe potential approval of Ethereum-based ETFs could be just the spark needed to reignite investor confidence and reinvigorate market activity.\n\nAs it stands, the cryptocurrency community is watching closely, waiting for signs of either a further decline or an unexpected rally that could redefine the current landscape."

        "content": "Hong Kong Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are due to go live on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, April 29.\n\nMainland Chinese investors are not allowed to invest in the products, save for those with residence permits.\n\nOfficials expect $300 million first-day issuance, far above $125 million seen in the US on January 11.\n\nA campaign that started in March is approaching its climax with Hong Kong\u2019s Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to hit markets on Tuesday, April 30.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the US inspires ambition among Hong Kong industry insiders\n\nHong Kong Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs to go live\n\nHong Kong will officially beat the US in the issuance of in-kind redemptions and subscriptions for Bitcoin ETFs, and then some, as the Asian state will also be issuing ETH ETFs ahead of the US. Local media reports that the products are set to go live at 9:30AM on Tuesday with an announcement from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nThe briefing cited Zhu Haokang, head of digital asset management and family wealth of China Asset Management (Hong Kong), and Wayne Huang, head of OSL ETF and custody business as they responded to interviews. Key elements in the Q&A are as follows:\n\nScale of capital inflows, Hong Kong vs. US\n\nAccording to Haokang, the trading scale of the Hong Kong virtual asset spot ETF on day one of listing can exceed the trading scale of the first day in the US:\n\nUS dollar, Hong Kong will exceed US$125 million, and China is confident to become the ETF issuer with the largest trading volume on the first day among the three issuers. The details can be revealed to everyone at 9:30 tomorrow morning.\n\nHuang added that while the products will debut on Tuesday, OSL completed its first day of raising funds on OSL on Monday, citing two funds, \u201cChinaAMC and another fund that cooperates with us.\u201d He added that the transactions witnessed so far are greater than the capital inflow of the US BTC spot ETF on its first day of trading.\n\nDifferentiating spot BTC ETF and spot ETH ETFs in Hong Kong\n\nHaokang said that unlike the US-based spot BTC ETFs, Hong Kong\u2019s products would have spot and physical subscriptions and redemptions. Also, ChinaAMC's Hong Kong spot ETF is the only ETF with the Hong Kong Dollar, US Dollar and RMB pairs.\n\nAnother difference is that beyond the listed shares, there are also unlisted shares. These options are not available in the other two companies.\n\nUnlike in the US, Hong Kong uses cash and physical subscriptions and is open for trading during Asian trading hours. This, according to Haokang, will still attract many American investors.\n\nThe reach of Hong Kong virtual asset spot ETF\n\nThe physical subscription method is an enabler even for Bitcoin mines as miners can use their Bitcoin holdings to directly purchase virtual asset spot ETFs in Hong Kong.\n\nIt would also reach regions like Singapore and the Middle East, which are yet to issue ETFs, with Haokang citing extreme interest among investors.\n\nFamily offices across Asia and overseas have also demonstrated interest in spot crypto ETFs.\n\nSecurities firms qualified to conduct relevant transactions in physical subscriptions\n\nCurrently, only three securities firms can do physical subscriptions in Hong Kong with more expected to come in. The three are Victory Securities, Huaying Securities, and OSL. Brokers are also expected to join the match starting in May.\n\nOperations for physical purchase\n\nHuang highlighted that this was the first time Hong Kong was going for physical operations, adding that the brokerage firm would have to upgrade its license to be able to handle virtual asset transactions:\n\nInvestors can transfer their coins to OSL through this brokerage firm, and then finally transfer their equity back to OSL. Transfer it to the fund's custody account and complete the entire process of physical subscription.\n\nOSL\u2019s anti-money laundering process in physical subscription\n\nTo open an account, investors are required to connect to OSL through a brokerage firm to open an account. There will be a whitelist verification on the transferring wallet as evidence that it belongs to the investor.\n\nInvestment verification will follow, where the user's private wallet is screened for suspicious activity in the past dozens of on-chain transactions. Passing whitelist verification allows money transfer.\n\nThe products will also allow wallet-to-wallet transfers between exchanges provided anti-money laundering rules of the other exchange are consistent with the OSL rules. \u201cWe can accept the other party's transfer of coins,, he said, adding , \u201cWe need the other exchange to provide certain customer information.\u201d\n\nAccessibility to mainland investors\n\nMainland Chinese investors are not allowed to invest in Hong Kong\u2019s cryptocurrency spot ETFs. It is only accessible to:\n\nHong Kong\u2019s qualified investors\n\nInstitutional investors\n\nRetail investors, and,\n\nInternational investors that meet the regulations\n\nHaokang advised the public to consult brokers and sales channels and monitor corresponding regulatory adjustments or the introduction of a specific regulatory framework in the future.\n\nImpact of US SEC deeming Ethereum a security on Hong Kong\u2019s Ethereum spot ETF\n\nWhether the US defines ETH as a security will not affect the independent decision-making of the Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission, said Huang, adding that the Commission has its own set of procedures for determining whether a certain virtual asset is a security and whether it can be opened to retail traders.\n\nFurther, Huang highlighted why Hong Kong can be a global pioneer in launching an Ethereum spot ETF. He said:\n\nThe regulation of cryptocurrency in the United States has multiple departments speaking out at the same time, or trying to regulate it.\n\nConversely, this mandate is defined in Hong Kong, unique to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. He added, \u201cHong Kong has already had a clear definition of Ethereum. Ethereum It is not a security, but the first non-securities virtual asset to be included in Hong Kong supervision together with Bitcoin, and it is one of the two targets that can be provided to retail investors.\u201d\n\nCrypto ETF FAQs What is an ETF? An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin\u2019s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset. Is Bitcoin futures ETF approved? Yes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator\u2019s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years. Is Bitcoin spot ETF approved? Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved outside the US, but the SEC is yet to approve one in the country. After BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF on June 15, the interest surrounding crypto ETFs has been renewed. Grayscale \u2013 whose application for a Bitcoin spot ETF was initially rejected by the SEC \u2013 got a victory in court, forcing the US regulator to review its proposal again. The SEC\u2019s loss in this lawsuit has fueled hopes that a Bitcoin spot ETF might be approved by the end of the year.\n\nPossibility of other virtual asset ETFs\n\nIssuers of these virtual assets together with the Commission must find a legal opinion of the security or a non-security status of the asset. They must also turn the legal opinion and the Commission\u2019s due diligence on the currency into a detailed research report and submit it to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\n\nFinal approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission will usher the asset to professional investors first. Once a specific liquidity threshold is attained, the asset will be accepted as an ETF. However, It will only be introduced for retail trading once it reaches the scope of an index."

        "content": "Franklin Templeton lists ETH ETF (EZET) on the DTCC website.\n\nHowever, May approval odds by the US SEC are still low.\n\nThe Ethereum [ETH] community got excited after Franklin Templeton Investments\u2019 spot ETH ETF was listed on the DTCC website.\n\nThe DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) is a key settlement organization for institutional trades and securities in the US. So, it\u2019s a great step for Franklin\u2019s Ethereum TR Ethereum [EZET] to be listed on DTCC.\n\nHowever, the US SEC has the final say on approval. Unfortunately, the SEC hasn\u2019t granted Franklin Templeton such a green light.\n\nDelay on Franklin Templeton Investments ETH ETF\n\nOn 23rd April, the US SEC delayed the decision on Franklin Templeton\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF proposal and requested more time. Part of the statement read,\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has also delayed decisions on other potential issuers, such as BlackRock, Van Eck, and Grayscale. With the May 2024 deadline approaching, rejection of the applications is more likely.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have kept the odds of May approval below 30%.\n\nIn a recent interview, Seyffart reiterated the same and suggested that approval may be likely in 2025,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen later in the year; the odds are slightly higher. But 2025 is looking more possible, but I\u2019ll have a better idea after I see the denial letters.\u201d\n\nJustin Sun, Tron founder, also expected May rejection, stating that,\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry still needs to prepare for a long-term education with regulators, focusing on helping them understand crypto.\u201d\n\nDespite prior statements that Ethereum isn\u2019t a security, like Bitcoin, the SEC has remained muted on ETH status.\n\nThe lack of clarity prompted Consensys, the firm behind the MetaMask wallet, to file a lawsuit against the SEC last week for the court to decide Ethereum\u2019s status.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH prices have remained below $3300 since mid-April. A strong recovery ahead of the Hong Kong spot ETH ETFs launch saw the altcoin hit a high of $3357.\n\nBut bulls faced rejection at the short-term resistance level of $3300 again. Ergo, a daily candlestick close above $3300 could confirm further bullish intention, especially if bears don\u2019t breach the $3000 psychological support."

        "content": "Hong Kong\u2019s debut of six new spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) marked a trading volume of HK$87.5 million ($11.2 million). This volume was significantly below the inaugural trading of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which achieved a staggering $4.6 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin\u2019s price dumped below $61,000, having experienced a 2.3% decline within the last 24 hours and an 8% decrease over the past week.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s ETFs Record Low Volumes\n\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) data indicates that the performance and interest in the six Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs managed by China Asset Management, Harvest Global, Bosera, and HashKey were relatively low after debuting in Hong Kong today.\n\nThe Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF recorded HK$249,000 in first-day trading volume, while the Bosera HashKey Ether ETF saw HK$99,000 in trading volume at the closing bell.\n\nIn contrast, the China Asset Management (CAM) Bitcoin ETF performed better, generating HK$4.6 million in trading volume at the closing bell. The CAM Ether ETF also had a trading volume of HK$4.6 million.\n\nBitcoin Falls Below $62,000\n\nEven with the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong, the overall sentiment in the crypto market remains negative. Perhaps driven by the disappointing numbers coming from Asia, BTC reacted in a negative manner and dumped below $61,000 for the first time in 11 days.\n\nBitcoin started last week with some positive momentum, briefly surpassing $67,000. However, it failed to sustain this upward trend and began to lose value, reaching a low of $60,700 on Monday.\n\nFollowing a brief recovery to $64,800, bitcoin faced another rejection, struggling to maintain even a minor rally. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto market followed suit, with the market capitalization dropping 3% over the last 24 hours to $2.35 trillion."

        "title": "BingX Introduces $REZ Spot Trading Amid Growing Popularity of Ethereum Restaking Ecosystem - Media OutReach",
        "content": "space, is poised to issue its launching on centralized exchanges. Its launching may also benefit the VILNIUS, LITHUANIA - Media OutReach Newswire - 30 April 2024 - The restaking category is growing in popularity, propelled by some eye-catching projects, such as Renzo EigenLayer , and others. Renzo ($REZ), with a high potential of becoming the top 1 token in the restaking space, is poised to issue its launching on centralized exchanges. Its launching may also benefit the Ethereum price as the restaking category will add vitality to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenzo (REZ) is a cryptocurrency project aiming to simplify and enhance Ethereum staking through its role as a Liquid Restaking Token and Strategy Manager for the EigenLayer protocol. EigenLayer focuses on a concept called Actively Validated Services which allows Renzo to potentially offer users higher yields than traditional ETH staking methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, Renzo acts as a bridge between users and the EigenLayer ecosystem. Users deposit their ETH holdings into Renzo, which then strategically allocates them within EigenLayer's network of validators. This process eliminates the complexities of managing validator nodes directly, making staking more accessible for everyday users.\n\n\n\n\n\nA key feature of Renzo is its issuance of ezETH, a Liquid Restaking Token. When you deposit ETH into Renzo, you receive an equivalent amount of ezETH. Unlike staked ETH, ezETH is a tradable token. This means you can hold ezETH to earn staking rewards (such as airdrop ) while retaining the flexibility to buy, sell, or trade it on compatible cryptocurrency exchanges. This liquidity aspect is a major advantage compared to traditional staking methods, where your ETH remains locked for an extended period.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother highlight of Renzo is its focus on promoting the wider adoption of EigenLayer. Users can also earn points for EigenLayer airdrop , if they stake ezETH via Renzo protocol. By acting as a user-friendly interface, Renzo encourages more people to participate in EigenLayer's network of validators, which contributes to the overall security and efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTrading of REZ will start on 2024-04-30\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are thrilled to offer our users the opportunity to trade these popular tokens,\" said Jason, BingX crypto asset analysis \"As one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, BingX is dedicated to providing a diverse range of assets and supporting the growth of innovative projects within the Base Chain ecosystem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTraders can now access REZ on BingX and take advantage of the platform's advanced trading features and liquidity. BingX Spot gives users early access to some of the most sought-after tokens in the space, with more that 700+ trading pairs."

        "title": "Ethereum to outshine Bitcoin this summer? Raoul Pal\u2019s bold prediction - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Analyst claims ETH will eclipse BTC in crypto summer.\n\nThe US liquidity injection could boost the market in the second half 2024.\n\nEthereum [ETH] could outshine Bitcoin [BTC] as we inch closer to crypto summer. The bold projection was made by Raoul Pal, founder of Real Vision and key crypto market commentary figure.\n\nIn an X post, Pal underscored that crypto summer is an altcoin season that shifts attention from Bitcoin to others. Part of his post read,\n\n\u201cCrypto Summer is usually the start of Alts season, which goes full \u201cbubble-tastic\u201d in Fall. This is when ETH bases and begins to outperform BTC. This is when SOL accelerates its outperformance of BTC & ETH.\u201d\n\nAdding a timeline to his projection and how \u201ccrazy\u201d things can get, Pal highlighted that,\n\n\u201cOnce the markets are full refreshed, that is usually when The Banana Zone starts, picking up to full mania towards the latter part of the year\u2026and well into 2025\u201d\n\nThe US liquidity factor\n\nPal\u2019s projection is purely based on historical data. However, past performance doesn\u2019t necessarily dictate future outcomes. So, what could be the key catalyst for Pal\u2019s wild projection?\n\nAn easing macro front is one of the likely factors. The Singapore-based crypto trading firm, QCP, emphasized how US liquidity injection could drive markets.\n\nIn a weekend update over Telegram, the firm acknowledged that US inflation was still hot. However, it reiterated that the US treasury could inject more liquidity in the second half of the year. Part of the statement read,\n\n\u201cHowever, at this point, monetary policy might matter much less than fiscal policy, which will be the main driver of liquidity and asset performance.\u201d\n\nThe firm added that,\n\n\u201cThe upcoming Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) on 1st May could also see higher issuances in short-term US bills. This will drain the RRP, which currently has USD 400 billion, and also increase liquidity.\u201d\n\nLast week, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes made a similar projection. He highlighted that extra liquidity will be injected into the economy during the US elections.\n\nMore liquidity means an extra money supply within global or local markets, especially when central banks cut interest rates. This is a perfect condition for risk-on assets to rally.\n\nWhether Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin remains to be seen. However, much of the hyped \u201ccrypto summer\u201d could be fueled mainly by macro factors rather than historical cycles."

        "content": "Developers were in two minds about 3074 EIP in Ethereum\u2019s recent developers call.\n\nPrice of ETH plummeted, on-chain metrics remained positive.\n\nEthereum\u2019s [ETH] latest Dencun upgrade was a success that helped many L2 solutions reduce fees to extremely low levels.\n\nAfter this upgrade, the Ethereum developers set their sights on their upcoming upgrade, Prague, on their recent call.\n\nNew developments\n\nEthereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, is expected to bring new features to crypto wallets, enhancing user experience.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3074, enables regular crypto wallets to function like smart contracts.\n\nOne key aspect of EIP-3074 is its ability to give standard wallets, like MetaMask, smart contract capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, it allows a third party to cover the gas fees associated with a user\u2019s transaction, potentially making transactions more affordable for users.\n\nIt also includes features such as transaction bundling, reducing the need for multiple signatures, and sponsored transactions, allowing wallets to delegate funds for others\u2019 use, similar to ERC-4337\u2019s account abstraction.\n\nSome developers argue that the proposed changes to EIP 3074 to allow broader use cases and global message revocation significantly increase its complexity, making it harder to implement and potentially introducing security risks.\n\nBecause of these circumstances, developers have decided to conduct a separate breakout meeting to discuss the technical aspects of EIP 3074.\n\nTheir aim is to reach a consensus on its implementation in a way that satisfies everyone, given its controversial nature.\n\nState of ETH\n\nThe developments being made to the Ethereum network may heavily influence the price movement of ETH going forward.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,170.97 and its price had fallen by 4.48% in the last 24 hours. However, the volume at which ETH was trading at, had grown by 9.33% in the same period.\n\nThe speculation around Spot ETFs around ETH was one of the major drivers of price movement for ETH in the last few days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nDespite the recent decline in price, the onchain metrics provided a positive picture. The network growth for ETH had also grown during this period, indicating that the number of new addresses showing interest in ETH had surged.\n\nThis renewed interest may help ETH see further bullish momentum going forward. Along with that, the velocity had also risen, indicating a heightened trading frequency for ETH."
