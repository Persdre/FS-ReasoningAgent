This is where Base by Coinbase comes in. Base is a new Ethereum-based crypto platform that increases transaction speed and security and supports a variety of applications.\n\nHere\u2019s what Base is, how it works, its benefits and potential drawbacks and its use cases.\n\nWhat is Base by Coinbase?\n\nBase by Coinbase is a crypto platform that uses the Ethereum network to increase transaction speed, security and accessibility while reducing costs. Unlike other cryptocurrency platforms, Base is specifically designed using blockchain to support decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nBase uses what\u2019s known as Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain. The Layer 2 blockchain is designed to perform transaction-heavy work with speed, keeping costs lower for the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1). Base uses OP Stack, an open-source development platform, to create greater compatibility and ease of transition for developers familiar with Ethereum.\n\nBecause of this approach, Base can offer low transaction fees, faster transaction times and full compatibility with Ethereum processes. Base is linked with Coinbase, making it accessible for broader adoption in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHow does Base work and what is it used for?\n\nBuilt as an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network, Base is designed to increase performance, interoperability and scalability while decreasing transaction costs and settlement time.\n\nBase processes transactions off-chain through a mechanism known as \u201crollups,\u201d bundling multiple transactions together and submitting them as a single batch to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 for validation. This approach reduces costs and load on the main Ethereum network.\n\nThe primary use cases for Base include the following:\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) platforms\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces\n\nGaming and virtual worlds\n\nSocial media platforms\n\nSupply chain and logistics applications\n\nBase\u2019s compatibility with Ethereum-based tools and frameworks, along with lower fees and faster transaction times, make it a useful platform for developers and individuals.\n\nThe benefits of Base by Coinbase\n\nBase by Coinbase offers some key advantages for individuals and businesses:\n\nFaster transactions: Base processes transactions quicker than the main Ethereum network, making it more efficient and user-friendly, especially during peak network activity.\n\nBase processes transactions quicker than the main Ethereum network, making it more efficient and user-friendly, especially during peak network activity.

Accessibility: Base is linked with Coinbase, one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, so it\u2019s easily accessible to a broad audience in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe potential drawbacks of Base\n\nWhile Base by Coinbase is a powerful tool, it\u2019s equally important to consider its potential limitations and challenges:\n\nComplexity: Layer 2 solutions such as Base can introduce complexity that may be daunting for newcomers to blockchain technology. This complexity could slow user adoption and create hurdles in understanding its functionality.\n\nLayer 2 solutions such as Base can introduce complexity that may be daunting for newcomers to blockchain technology.

This lack might put Base at a disadvantage as it can\u2019t incentivize developer activity through token grants, a common practice in the blockchain ecosystem. Scalability concerns: Despite its robust infrastructure, Base has had transaction failures and increased gas fees during periods of high use. So it may need further scalability to manage significant user growth in the future.\n\nDespite its robust infrastructure, Base has had transaction failures and increased gas fees during periods of high use. So it may need further scalability to manage significant user growth in the future. User experience: The transition from traditional Ethereum transactions to Base might not be seamless for all users, leading to potential difficulties.\n\nCan you buy Base from Coinbase?\n\nCoinbase says it does not currently plan to issue a new network token for Base. Instead, Base will use Ethereum as its native gas token. So at least for now there is no Base crypto coin to buy.\n\nCoinbase warns that users should be aware that scammers may try to send fake Base tokens and suggests that you don\u2019t interact with anyone peddling fake Base coins.\n\nBottom line\n\nBase by Coinbase is a Layer 2 solution for the Ethereum network, offering faster transaction times, lower fees and increased compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite some key advantages, users should pay attention to potential drawbacks such as security and complexity."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming full approval of a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be a significant milestone in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. This development not only impacts ethereum but also broadens the horizon for the entire crypto industry. Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson and David Uhryniak, Director of Ecosystem Development at TRON DAO, weigh in on the implications of this event.\n\nAccording to Nelson, the approval is not just a win for ethereum but a sign of increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. He emphasized that while bitcoin might experience a temporary setback, the overall trend is positive for the entire crypto space.\n\nTRON DAO's David Uhryniak noted that the approval represents a crucial step towards wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. He believes that as more people become comfortable discussing and investing in digital currencies like ethereum and bitcoin, they will begin to see the practical applications of these technologies in their everyday lives.\n\nThis growing familiarity with cryptocurrencies could lead to greater integration of blockchain technology in various sectors, he said. Uhryniak envisions a future where owning a piece of ethereum or bitcoin prompts individuals to explore how these assets are used, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding and broader application in workplaces and beyond."

Ethereum-based meme coins, Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAs per the report, the explosive rallies of WIF and BONK on Solana have drawn significant attention and capital from other blockchains, creating a cycle of increased meme coin performance and investment. While meme coins exist across various blockchains, Solana and Ethereum lead in activity and trading volume.\n\nEthereum meme coins are more well-known because they were primarily introduced in 2023 or earlier. In contrast, most Solana meme currencies came onto the scene in late 2023 or early 2024, capitalizing on the surge in attention at the time.\n\nPolitical meme tokens have become a prominent subgenre inside the $57.7 billion meme currency market with a market valuation of $784 million. The MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin has increased in value by more than 5,100% this year due in large part to Trump\u2019s open endorsement of cryptocurrencies and his acceptance of cryptocurrency contributions for his campaign.\n\nThe exceptional performance of Solana-based meme coins underscores a growing shift in speculative investments within the crypto space. This trend is not only reshaping the dynamics between different blockchain ecosystems but also highlights the increasing integration of political narratives within the meme coin market.\n\nAs crypto becomes a significant topic for the upcoming November US elections, political meme coins are expected to continue attracting speculative interest, further driving their market activity and value."

        "content": "SEC delays decision on Ethereum ETF S-1 drafts as analysts shifted their potential launch date again.\n\nEthereum whale risks liquidation if ETH declines to $2,984.\n\nEthereum breaches key support amid key insight from CME open interest.\n\nEthereum is down more than 5% on Thursday following the Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) failure to approve ETH ETF issuers' S-1 drafts. Meanwhile, the recent decline has strengthened the bearish outlook after ETH moved below a key support level, sparking $90 million in long liquidations.\n\nDaily digest market movers: SEC yet to approve ETH ETF\n\nDespite its light comments on issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts, the SEC has yet to approve spot ETH ETFs following the US Independence Day holiday. As a result, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart shifted his over/under date for a potential approval to next weekend.\n\nThe SEC approved spot ETH ETF issuers' 19b-4 filings in May, but also need to sign off on their S-1s before the products go live.\n\nNate Geraci, President of ETF Store, noted that the SEC expects issuers to amend their S-1s by July 8, with another round of filings potentially due around July 12. This \"would theoretically mean launch week of July 15\" for spot ETH ETFs, wrote Geraci in an X post.\n\nMeanwhile, following the recent market decline, a whale who longed ETH via the Compound protocol is about to be liquidated, according to data from Lookonchain. The whale deposited 12,734 ETH worth $40 million to Compound and borrowed $31.4 million worth of dollar-denominated stablecoins with a health rate of 1.06. The whale risks liquidation if the price of ETH drops to $2,984.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum bears lead market amid slight bullish sentiment from US investors\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,132 on Thursday, down more than 5% on the day. The decline wiped out more than $90.81 million worth of long positions from the market, bringing the total ETH liquidations to $102.48 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nETH has now breached the $3,203 key support level, strengthening its bearish outlook. With the move, ETH has fully balanced the market inefficiency from itsprice spike following news of the SEC's U-turn on spot ETH ETFs.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nETH may test the $3,029 support level in the next few hours. A bounce from this level will cool the bearish momentum. However, a move below it may see ETH seeking support around the $2,852 price level.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Ethereum's futures open interest (OI) across top exchanges declined by almost 5%. Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts in a derivatives market that are yet to be settled.\n\nWhile the move signified wider risk aversion from traders, Ethereum's CME OI was an outlier, rising almost 1% in the last 24 hours. This indicates that US investors may be slightly bullish despite declining prices due to expectations of spot ETH ETFs' launch.\n\nAnother key insight is that spot ETH ETFs may experience impressive flows using the rising ETH CME OI as a proxy to measure investors' sentiment. As a result, ETH may take bears by surprise and rally past its yearly high, invalidating the bearish thesis."

Discover SCENE\n\nAsset manager Bitwise submitted an updated registration statement for its proposed spot Ethereum ETF with regulators on Wednesday, disclosing its plans to waive fees. While largely procedural, this latest revision is seen by market observers as a sign that the launch of Ethereum ETFs is imminent.\n\n\u201cExpect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week,\u201d Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter (aka X). \u201cWe're thinking these things could potentially [be listed] later next week, or the week of the 15th at this point.\u201d\n\nAfter shares in the Bitwise Ethereum ETF are listed on an exchange, Bitwise will waive a yet-to-be-defined management fee on the first $500 million its fund garners during that period, the amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated.\n\nBitwise\u2019s move follows similar ones from Franklin Templeton and VanEck. Both ETF hopefuls have included fee waivers in filings for the first $10 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnticipation of the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs has grown steadily since the regulator\u2019s last-minute approval in May. While the SEC approved several so-called form 19b-4s, it has yet to green light individual S-1 filings from asset managers, which are needed for trading to begin.\n\nBitwise submitted its amended S-1 days before it was actually due, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. On Twitter, he floated the idea that Bitwise \u201cwanted to get it off their plate,\u201d and that the SEC\u2019s latest round of comments appeared to be minimal.\n\n\u201cFrom what I hear the last round of comments were \u2018literally nothing\u2019\u2014took zero time to update,\u201d he said.\n\nBalchunas concurred that the class of products seems on track to begin trading this month. At the same time, he wondered why the regulator appears to be dragging its feet, considering the SEC seems mostly satisfied with the filings that firms have put forward so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven how light comments were, these could have easily been trading by now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCould be one 'problem' issuer slowing down [the] process or just summertime.\u201d\n\nNot long after spot Ethereum ETFs were approved on May 23, the cryptocurrency rallied to around $4,000. Yet as the approval process has played out, Ethereum\u2019s price has shed most of those gains, drifting down $3,270, as of this writing.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler said last month that the process for launching spot Ethereum ETFs is \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest Summit, he added that progress is dependent on asset managers providing full disclosures.\n\nThough Bitwise\u2019s amended filing has few changes, it does include new disclosure language. For example, a clause was inserted stating the \u201cchair of the SEC has stated that the SEC has authority under existing laws to regulate the digital asset sector\u201d within a section on oversight.\n\nBitwise also added a few sentences disclosing that certain digital asset trading platforms, to the extent that they are regulated, may not be in compliance with applicable rules.\n\nFinally, a section also outlines the \u201cInitial Creation of Ether.\u201d Looking at Ethereum\u2019s initial supply of 72 million, it shows how most was sold to the public through a crowd sale in 2014, alongside distributions to the Ethereum Foundation and the network's developers.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Ethereum ETFs are expected to launch any day.\n\nExperts expect explosive growth if the success of Bitcoin ETFs is replicated.\n\nBitcoin ETFs may see $50 billion in inflows over the next year.\n\nIt\u2019s almost here.\n\nMarket watchers expect the US Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds after the Independence Day weekend.\n\nThe launch of the funds comes after spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $14 billion in inflows since their January launch.\n\nThose funds also catapulted Bitcoin\u2019s price to record highs in March.\n\nWill spot Ethereum ETFs have a similar effect?\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts expect.\n\nInflows\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF inflows will surge by 257% to $50 billion by the end of 2025 as large platforms like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch start to approve them.\n\nThat\u2019s according to crypto ETF provider Bitwise\u2019s chief investment officer Matt Hougan, who made that case in an investor note this week.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nEthereum on-exchange products will attract $15 billion in net flows in their first 18 months, he said in a separate note.\n\nAnd crypto exchange OKX\u2019s chief commercial officer told DL News he expects investors to pour up to $500 million into the ETFs in their first week.\n\nOthers offer a more bearish outlook, saying spot Ethereum ETFs will be unable to replicate the success of their Bitcoin kin.\n\nFor one, Ethereum lacks a clear narrative akin to Bitcoin\u2019s status as a haven asset.\n\nMechanism Capital\u2019s managing partner Andrew Kang and TP Icap\u2019s co-head of digital assets Duncan Trenholme have both voiced those concerns.\n\nBeating the odds\n\nHougan argued that there is a way for the world\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency to beat the odds \u2014 by recognising that Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201care as different as gold and oil.\u201d\n\nWhile Bitcoin is structured as a monetary asset, Ethereum is more like a tech platform that enables others to build new applications upon it, he said.\n\n\u201cInvestors love technology stocks,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cNearly all investors have exposure to high-growth tech plays like Nvidia and Meta, and relatively few have exposure to monetary assets like gold.\u201d\n\nBut for Ethereum to beat expectations, the idea that it is a tech asset must gain momentum, he said.\n\nThat equires more adoption of Ethereum-enabled initiatives, such as stablecoin or tokenisation products.\n\n\u201cMaybe someone needs to launch a new ETF that\u2019s 10% ETH and 90% tech stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a starting point for the future of technology, you could do a lot worse.\u201d\n\nWhat about the price?\n\nSpot Ethereum ETFs launching is expected to trigger a new crypto rally.\n\nSingapore-based QCP has suggested that Ether will surge to $5,430 on the back of the ETFs.\n\nOthers \u2014 like research firm Bernstein and Lekker Capital \u2014 suggest the launch will drive the price to $6,600 and $7,000 respectively.\n\nFor Bitcoin, Bernstein predicted that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 over the next year, helped by growing crypto adoption, Donald Trump\u2019s pro-crypto stance, and the powerful industry lobby.\n\nWintermute, similarly, projected that Bitcoin can reach $100,000 before the end of the year.\n\nIn the short term, however, investors are betting that Bitcoin will continue to wobble.\n\nTraders are hedging against a downturn \u2014 driven in part by crypto exchange Mt. Gox\u2019s repayments to creditors, and governments selling seized Bitcoin on the open market \u2014 by piling into bullish Ether option trades.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 4.3% over the past 24 Horus to trade at $60,169.\n\nEthereum is down 4.3% to $3,300.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nEric Johansson is DL News\u2019 News Editor.

        "title": "Ethereum: Its History and Future Outlook - Camarillo Acorn",
        "content": "Ethereum, the world computer, has been instrumental in the blockchain and the cryptocurrency community since its entrance. Being one of the largest platforms for the implementation of smart contracts and dApps, Ethereum has become a platform for many new ideas in the digital economy niche. Appreciating its history from when it was born up to the present and its possibilities is useful in comprehending its importance and possibilities. Also, certain points in Ethereum\u2019s timeline can be marked as important, for example, the Ethereum price all time high and the lowest price Ethereum has hit in 2024.\n\nThe Birth of Ethereum\n\nEthereum was introduced in late 2013 by a young programmer, Vitalik Buterin. Buterin planned on building a platform surpassing what Bitcoin can offer, a decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and dApps. This vision aimed at using blockchain technology not only to de-centralize money but also a number of applications and operations.\n\nThe development of Ethereum was backed by an ICO in 2014, the project creators accepted over 18 million dollars in Bitcoins. This funding effort was a testimony to the fact that the people believed in Buterin\u2019s vision. The Ethereum network officially went live on July 30, 2015, with the first block known as the \u201cFrontier.\u201d\n\nEthereum\u2019s Evolution and Milestones\n\n1. Early Growth and Adoption: The early years of Ethereum though were quite dynamic and experienced high adoption rates. Due to the ability of Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, developers began to actively engage in developing dApps. Many initiatives, starting from decentralized finance (DeFi) and ending with gaming, appeared during this period and were based on Ethereum.\n\n2. The DAO and Its Aftermath: A major milestone in the history of Ethereum is The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack in 2016. The DAO was a very ambitious project envisioned as a decentralized venture capital fund. However, a flaw in its code was taken advantage of, and 50 million dollars in Ether were stolen. This caused a rather bitter fork, where the community was split in two: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, whose token is ETC. The reason for forking was the community\u2019s decision to get the funds back and to make the platform trustworthy.\n\n3. Reaching All-Time Highs: The price of Ethereum has been volatile over the years, which depicts the growth of the currency and people\u2019s interest in it and the crypto space as a whole. The highest Ethereum has ever been recorded was in November 2021 when one ETH was trading at above $4800. This milestone signified the escalating beliefs in the Ethereum project and cryptocurrencies with the DeFi, NFTs, and the Ethereum 2.0 launch.\n\n4. The Technology Behind Ethereum: Ethereum platform is based on implementing smart contracts and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are digital contracts that are self-executing with the terms of the contract written in code. These contracts operate on the EVM, meaning that the implementation of these contracts is done to the letter as is coded, and there are no chances of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party meddling.\n\n5. Ethereum 2. 0: An essential shift that characterizes Ethereum technology is the shift to Ethereum 2. 0, also called Eth2 or Serenity. Ethereum 2. As for the platform\u2019s major concerns such as scalability, security, and energy consumption, 0 attempts to tackle some of them. The upgrade involves moving from the proof of work (PoW) to the proof of stake (PoS).\n\n6. Proof-of-Stake (PoS): In PoS, the validators are selected to produce new blocks and check transactions depending on the number of tokens they own and are willing to pledge. This is anticipated to cut energy usage by a large margin, thus improving Ethereum\u2019s sustainability. Moreover, PoS is aimed at increasing the network capacity so that more transactions can be processed per second, eliminating the issue of high traffic and high gas fees.\n\nBenefits and Challenges\n\nBenefits\n\nDecentralization and Security: Ethereum\u2019s decentralized nature ensures that there is no single point of failure for applications.\n\nInnovation Platform: Ethereum introduced the smart contract feature, which created a market of decentralized applications combined with various industries, from finance to gaming and even supply chains.\n\nInteroperability: Ethereum\u2019s open-source architecture ensures the integration and cooperation between various platforms and applications in the ecosystem.\n\nChallenges\n\nScalability Issues: Nonetheless, Ethereum has a major problem of scalability whereby the network usually gets congested and this attracts high charges. Ethereum 2. 0 also aims at solving these problems but the change is gradual and continuous.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not free from the criticism of the regulating authorities. Changes in the law on its uptake and application can influence it.\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities: Smart contracts are very effective but sometimes contain errors and flaws that can lead to attacks such as the one witnessed in the DAO hack.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nSeveral prospects indicate that Ethereum\u2019s future is bright, and several important advancements are likely to strengthen its status as a dominant blockchain.\n\nEthereum 2. 0 Implementation: The complete execution of Ethereum 2. These include scalability, security, and energy efficiency, and it is expected that the 5G network 0 will offer many improvements. This upgrade may encourage developers and enterprises to deploy their applications on the Ethereum network since it is a more reliable and fast network.\n\nDeFi and NFT Growth: The DeFi and NFT markets which are closely associated with Ethereum are expected to expand in the future. DeFi applications provide financial services with no intermediaries, and NFTs are non-interchangeable digital assets that include art, virtual land, etc. For Ethereum these innovations will be vital for its to remain relevant in the future which is why the support for these innovations will be important.\n\nEnterprise Adoption: Enterprises are increasingly using blockchain solutions to enhance business aspects such as transparency, security, and efficiency. Ethereum\u2019s well-deepened ecosystem and further growth make it a valuable candidate for enterprise use, which can result in further expansion and becoming a more widespread part of business processes.\n\nCommunity and Development: The Ethereum community has been, and continues to be, very engaged and enthusiastic about the platform. This way, it is possible to constantly improve and develop the approach that corresponds to the current tendencies and issues. Given that the Ethereum\u2019s development is based on a principle of collaboration, it will most probably remain a leader in the field of block-chain technologies.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nEthereum has evolved from a unique concept to one of the most significant parts of the blockchain and cryptocurrency sphere. It has introduced the elegance of smart contracts and Decentralized applications to the world, which has completely changed the way assets are interacted with and managed.\n\nDespite the issues concerning the network, including the matters of scaling and the legal environment, the further evolution of Ethereum 2. Thus, it has a 0 ranking and strong community backing, which shows it has a bright future ahead of it. Thus, as Ethereum is constantly developing, it is ready to stay one of the leaders in the digital economy and contribute to the development of further implementations of decentralized technologies."

        "title": "Ethereum poised to follow Nvidia's steps as Bitwise files updated S-1 draft - FXStreet",
        "content": "Ethereum ETFs expected to begin trading in July after Bitwise files amended S-1 ahead of due date.\n\nEthereum ETFs could flip analysts' expectations if investors buy into ETH's Nvidia-like high-growth tech play narrative.\n\nEthereum derivatives data reveals investors are becoming more risk averse following Mt. Gox headwind on horizon.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is down 3% on Wednesday following Bitwise filing an updated S-1 draft and a wider market downturn with potential Mt. Gox BTC supply flooding the market. Despite the general market lull, investors may gain consolation from Bitwise prediction that Ethereum ETFs could outperform analysts' expectations if positioned as a high-growth tech play similar to Nvidia.\n\nDaily digest market movers: Could Ethereum be the next Nvidia?\n\nAsset manager Bitwise filed its amended S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today ahead of its July 8 due date. The new filing added a fee waiver for up to $500 million in assets under management, similar to Van Eck's waiver last week.\n\nConsidering the comments on these drafts were light, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said spot ETH ETFs should have begun trading and expects them to launch before the end of July.\n\nThe SEC approved spot ETH ETF issuers' 19b-4 filings in May but also needs to greenlight their S-1 registration statements before the products can begin trading.\n\nAccording to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, Ethereum ETFs could be more successful than earlier predicted if investors buy into the narrative that Ethereum is a high-growth tech play similar to Meta and Nvidia. Hougan had earlier predicted that spot ETH ETFs could attract up to $15 billion in net flows before the end of 2025.\n\n\"It's pretty easy for me to imagine investors selling a small amount of their tech exposure and adding ETH. I'd argue it's easier than imagining investors carving out an entirely separate portfolio sleeve for a new monetary asset,\" Hougan noted.\n\nHowever, people need to buy into the idea that \"Ethereum is a technology investment\" for this to happen. Hougan noted that a clear understanding of how Ethereum differs from Bitcoin and the growth of applications on its network would help strengthen the \u201chigh-growth tech play\u201d narrative.\n\n\"What might that look like? Imagine stablecoins going from $160 billion to $1.6 trillion in assets as more people embrace the speed and transparency of blockchain-enabled payments. Or consider decentralized finance applications opening up new avenues for lending and borrowing with the onset of regulatory clarity. Or imagine more firms following BlackRock's lead and building tokenized funds on the Ethereum platform,\" said Hougan.\n\nMeanwhile, Lookonchain revealed in a recent analysis that Ethereum ranks number one among blockchain networks in terms of yearly revenue. Ethereum's revenue is at $2.728 billion per year, with Bitcoin coming behind at $1.302 billion. Increased revenue often indicates high user activity in a blockchain network, which helps estimate bullish sentiment.\n\nETH technical analysis: Ethereum traders are skeptical with Mt. Gox headwind in sight\n\nEthereum is trading around $3,307, down about 3% in the past 24 hours. ETH breached the $3,367 support level, pouring cold water on hopes of a potential rebound. ETH liquidations reached $44.33 million, equalling that of BTC in the past 24 hours despite having a lower market cap. Long liquidations accounted for 87% of ETH's total liquidations, with shorts at 13%.\n\nEthereum options open interest has declined by 57% since its spike following the SEC's approval of 19b-4 filings of spot ETH ETF issuers. As of May 24, ETH options OI was at $13.44 billion. However, following the expiry of May and June options, most investors have failed to open new positions as indicated in the chart below.\n\nETH options OI\n\nETH options OI is now at $5.69 billion, its lowest level since September. The decreasing options OI accompanied by ETH's price decline suggests option traders are more risk-averse. Two possible reasons for the uncertainty among traders include:\n\nSEC's delay in greenlighting prospective spot ETH ETF issuers\u2019 S-1 drafts.\n\nPrevailing wider market bearish sentiment from Mt. Gox BTC supply.\n\nThe ETH Long/Short ratio also provides insights into traders' sentiment in the past week. The ratio's 7-day average is at 0.946, indicating the futures market is tilted toward the downside.\n\nAs a result, ETH may sustain a horizontal movement in the coming weeks until the SEC approves issuers' S-1 drafts for spot ETH ETFs to begin trading.\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nA breach of the $3,203 support could strengthen bearish sentiment and send ETH back to the $2,850 to $3,029 range."

        "content": "Multiple industry analysts believe that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be on track to be launched in mid-July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to industry sources that were cited in a recent Bloomberg report, multiple applicants are supposed to submit their amended S-1 forms before July 8.\n\nAs noted by Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, this would mean that the final approval of S-1 forms is expected to take place by July 12. This would \"theoretically\" mean the launch week of July 15, according to Geraci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry after it unexpectedly greenlit rule rules changes (19b-4 forms) in May. The Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a powerful rally shortly after that decision. However, that rally was short-lived since the SEC had yet to complete the two-step ETF approval process that also included S-1 forms.\n\nIn late June, SEC boss Gary Gensler stated that the approval of Ethereum ETFs was going \"smoothly\" after previously claiming that these hotly anticipated products would be able to start trading this summer.\n\nSell the news?\n\nAccording to a recent report by K33 Research, the Ethereum price might fall right after the launch of several spot ETFs in the U.S.\n\nHowever, K33 Research still expects that inflows into spot ETFs will be a boon for the price of the leading altcoin. These inflows could reach up to 1% of the cryptocurrency's total circulating supply, according to the firm.\n\nLast week, Steno Research predicted that these products could possibly attract up to $20 billion worth of inflows within the first year of their trading."

        "content": "Ethereum has surpassed Bitcoin in fee income over the past year by an epic 100%, according to the newest report from Lookonchain. Thus, its network has recorded $2.73 billion in fee income, the most in the industry. Bitcoin, in second place, generated $1.3 billion. Closing the top three is Tron Network, with almost $460 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther networks also contributed to the overall fee income landscape. Solana generated $241.3 million, Binance's chain accumulated $176.6 million and Avalanche recorded $68.83 million. Additionally, the zkSync Era earned nearly $60 million, Optimism $40.4 million and Polygon $23.9 million.\n\nHere are the top 10 chains by 1-year fee revenue.#Ethereum earns a fee of $2.728B per year, #Bitcoin earns a fee of $1.302B per year, and #TronNetwork earns a fee of $459.39M per year. pic.twitter.com/ixAiP9g8JA \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 3, 2024\n\nAs the data highlights, Ethereum has a significant lead, doubling Bitcoin's revenue. This result is attributed to a broader range of applications and services on the network of the main altocin, with higher usage and transaction fees as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure win?\n\nEthereum's ecosystem supports decentralized finance platforms, NFTs and various applications, all of which contribute to increased transaction volume and fee income. This is what has positioned ETH as a more versatile and widely used network compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn return, Bitcoin's revenue, while still over a billion dollars, is primarily driven by its role as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. Its transaction fees are affected by network congestion and the price of BTC itself, which can fluctuate significantly.\n\nHowever, it still lacks the extensive range of applications found in the Ethereum ecosystem, resulting in lower overall fee income."

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is slowly moving toward the $3,000 price level, and it seems inevitable if the market does not face an unexpected influx of fresh funds, which is unlikely. Investors should be ready to see Ethereum at $3,000 and potentially even lower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price of Ethereum is getting close to $3,000. This means that there will probably be more volatility on the market. In the past, traders have been drawn to important psychological levels like $3,000 in order to take advantage of possible deals and sellers to limit losses.\n\nIt is wise for investors to prepare for potential fluctuations and contemplate tactics to efficiently handle their risks: options, futures hedging, funds redistribution and other strategies may come in handy. The $3,000 drop could have a big impact on investor sentiment.\n\nEthereum, which frequently trades above crucial levels like $3,500, has benefited greatly from the investment community's strong support. A decline below these levels could cause confidence to waver, especially among individual investors, who may see the drop as an indication of an extended bearish phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn increase in caution when investing in Ethereum may result from this change in trading volumes. The ecosystem of Ethereum may be impacted by the drop in price. We are already seeing a notable outflow from the network, which does not really benefit the digital silver.\n\nFurthermore, the financial strain that Ethereum-based projects may experience could impede ecosystem innovation and development. The NFT (non-fungible token) and DeFi (decentralized finance) markets are no longer around levels we had seen back in 2021, and current tendencies show that things are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future."

        "content": "Lido has reported a rise in staked Ethereum on its platform despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifying its staking programs as securities in its lawsuit against Consensys.\n\nStaked Ethereum increase\n\nA July 2 report showed that Lido users staked an additional 95,616 ETH between June 24 and July 1. This increased the total value of assets staked on the platform by 1.26%, reaching $33.48 billion.\n\nDuring this period, Lido led in net Ethereum deposit inflows, surpassing centralized exchanges like Binance and Gate.io and the rapidly growing liquid restaking project Ether.fi.\n\nThe platform also revealed significant activity in its wrapped staked ETH (wstETH) on Layer 2 networks like Scroll, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. The total number of assets on these blockchains increased by 7.19% to 141,586, bringing the 7-day trading volume to $1.23 billion.\n\nHowever, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staked ETH decreased slightly, dropping 0.04% to 2.96%.\n\nNode decentralization\n\nLido is enhancing decentralization efforts by launching a Community Staking Module (CSM) to promote more decentralized Ethereum node operations.\n\nAccording to official documentation, CSM will integrate a diverse range of Node Operators, including Solo stakers, into the network. The module will also allow permissionless entry for node operators. It added:\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal for this module is to allow for permissionless entry to the Lido on Ethereum Node Operator set and enfranchise solo-staker participation in the protocol, increasing the total number of independent Node Operators in the overall Ethereum network.\u201d\n\nThis move would mark a clear departure from its previous approach, which required its DAO to approve a new node operator before its addition to the platform. However, its current initiative would allow solo staking to become more attractive and accessible for interest validators by introducing \u201creasonably low bond for Node Operators\u201d and requiring \u201cno secondary token collateral.\u201d\n\nThe module is in early adoption mode on the Holesky testnet and is expected to transition to a permissionless state on July 11, 2024.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum is hanging on the edge at $3,365, as this price level is actually far more important than you might think. The asset has clearly gained serious ground for a reversal after breaking above the 100 EMA, but right now, ETH is in some trouble and may reach $3,000 quite soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum has historically held up at this critical support level, which is located roughly where the $3,365 level is. If Ether were to fall below this mark, it would indicate that this support is no longer there and will probably descend to $3,000. This is the next significant psychological level. The 100 EMA frequently serves as a reliable gauge of the general trend, and a break below it may trigger a large sell-off.\n\nThe 200 EMA is the only significant support level between the 100 EMA and the 200 EMA in terms of technical support aside from the 200 EMA, which is located much further below. Ethereum may see a swift decline to the 200 EMA level, or roughly $3,000 in case of a breakdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only has Ethereum broken above the 100 EMA, but it has also broken below the consolidation channel it has been trading in for the last few weeks. This channel has given traders some predictability by providing a range in which ETH has moved. A break below $3,365 would mean that the market is leaving this channel to the downside, suggesting that the trend may be turning from bullish to bearish and potentially causing more losses.\n\nThe 100 EMA serves as a key support level, and a break below it might cause ETH to move rapidly toward $3,000 because there would be no other support level. Furthermore, a breach below this level would indicate a break out of the current consolidation channel and could indicate a reversal of the bearish trend."

        "content": "Much attention has been focused on Ethereum Name Service (ENS) in recent days. Ethereum Name Service increased by 41% over the past week, signalling a solid uptrend with further upside potential. In a broader sense, ENS headed up nearly 14% over the past 30 days, testifying to this token\u2019s sheer resilience and growth potential.\n\nThis impressive surge can be attributed mainly to Bitcoin\u2019s price rebound. The upward momentum that Bitcoin\u2019s rise created for altcoins has given them room for losses to recover and set their eyes on new highs. With the lead set by this top cryptocurrency, Ethereum Name Service and other altcoins follow through in a continuum, further benefiting from renewed investor confidence.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum Name Service stands at $31.90, with a trading volume of $1.17 billion within the last 24 hours and a market capitalization of $1.00 billion. In the past 24 hours, Ethereum Name Service has added 10.54% to its value, additional backing for what is already an extraordinary cryptocurrency market player.\n\nEthereum Name Service (ENS) Sees Remarkable Growth, Eyes $120 Target 4\n\nAnalyst Sees Potential for $120 for Ethereum Name Service (ENS)\n\nCrypto analyst Matthew Hyland believes in an optimistic price trajectory for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). As per Hyland, if it breaks out from its current levels, Ethereum Name Service will reach as high as $120. Hyland\u2019s bullish prediction came from ENS\u2019s recent performance.\n\nThe analyst mentioned that he had recommended this to his Patreon subscribers when it was $17.50, exactly on the night of the ETH ETF approval a few weeks ago. Unaffectedly, with ENS currently trading at around $30 and showing every sign of attempting a breakout, this recommendation has paid off.\n\nHyland\u2019s insights and predictions give further weight to the growing confidence placed by the crypto community in ENS. His price target of $120 foreshadows a substantial upside potential from current levels, so it has emerged as one of the cryptocurrencies investors will watch over the next few months.\n\nAs ENS values surge, many opportunities emerge within the crypto market, gaining optimism from well-esteemed analysts like Hyland. The eyes of investors and enthusiasts are fastened on Ethereum Name Service, hoping for more significant gains as the market evolves.\n\nRelated Reading | Ethereum Set for Explosive 30% Surge as ETF Approval Nears, Says Analysts"

        "content": "Following the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETFs] in the U.S., the community has been awaiting the arrival of Ethereum ETFs. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum faced its own set of hurdles. But things seem to be falling into place as the approval for ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] could be weeks away.\n\nAccording to Steve Kurz, the head of asset management at Galaxy Digital Ether ETFs, they will most likely get a green signal sometime in July. He believes that the ETFs are currently in the \u201cwindow dressing\u201d stage. Kurz added,\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ve done this before. This is methodical, this is window dressing, and the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now, we did it with the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2014 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there are a total of eight firms lined up for approval of Ethereum ETFs. This covers BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Fidelity, iShares, Galaxy Digital, Grayscale, and 21Shares. These companies have already received permission to list their shares on exchanges. But before their shares can be traded, they must receive clearance for their S-1 filing.\n\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency: 3 ETH Coins To Stash Before Ethereum ETF Boom\n\nCan This Approval Boost the Price of Ethereum in July?\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,349.33 following a 2.58% daily drop. According to Changelly, ETH will surge to a high of $3,555.49. The average trading price for the altcoin will remain around $3,510. Ethereum could mostly see a bigger surge considering the current hype around spot ETFs.\n\nIn addition, a K33 Research analysis revealed that Ether ETFs would be a \u201cgolden egg\u201d for the altcoin\u2019s price.

        "title": "Will Ethereum Price Surge in 2024? What Traders Should Know - CoinGape",
        "content": "As 2024 progresses and the cryptocurrency market keeps evolving, Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, stands as a strong contender, garnering the attention of both investors and traders. With various developments in the pipeline, and a volatile market to deal with, there are speculations about ETH price will surge this year. This article delves into the key factors that could influence Ethereum price in 2024 and what traders should keep an eye on.\n\nRecent Market Performance of Ethereum Price\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum price has experienced challenges in the market, having declined by 2.8% in the past day to trade today at $3,357.89. The past month was not friendly either, with the token recorded losses of about 12.17%. With a market cap of $403.6 billion, and a trading volume of $10.8 billion, ETH remains a strong contender among cryptocurrencies. Although the coin achieved its all-time high milestone of $4,891.70 on November 16, 2021, it has since dropped in price by 31.32%.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Ethereum\u2019s Price in 2024\n\n1. Ethereum Upgrades and Developments\n\nIn 2024, the Ethereum network will experience several major enhancements. The ongoing \u201cSharding\u201d is designed to improve the network\u2019s scalability even more.\n\nSharding will enable Ethereum to handle numerous transactions at once, easing congestion and decreasing gas fees. Anticipated enhancements in technology are likely to draw in additional developers and users to the platform, potentially increasing the need for ETH\n\n2. Institutional Adoption\n\nInterest from institutions in Ethereum is increasing. Many big financial institutions are starting to incorporate Ethereum in their activities, whether through investing directly, using DeFi apps, or creating products based on Ethereum.\n\nIn 2024, the anticipated introduction of Ethereum ETFs could potentially unlock the doors for a surge of institutional funds. These advancements are expected to increase investor trust and encourage interest in ETH.\n\n3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion\n\nEthereum has been behind the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. The sector has seen an increasing number of assets on Ethereum. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms and yield farming are innovations on DeFI continuing to gain traction.\n\nAs the ecosystem expands, the demand and utility for ETH are likely to increase, positively impacting its price.\n\n4. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Metaverse\n\nEthereum is also making big advancements in the metaverse and NFT areas. The popularity of virtual real estate, collectibles and digital arts is driving demand for ETH, especially since most NFTs are created on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nMost NFTs are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. As the concept of metaverse develops, the role of Ethereum in fueling these virtual worlds could result in higher adoption, leading to increase in ETH price.\n\n5. Regulatory Environment\n\nThe regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies still has both positive and negative aspects. Although clear regulations can support growth, overly strict policies may hinder innovation and discourage investment.\n\nTraders need to monitor regulatory changes worldwide, as they could affect the price of Ethereum. Favorable ETF approvals or supportive blockchain policies could trigger price surges as positive regulatory updates.\n\nTechnical Analysis and Market Sentiment\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) technical analysis shows a complex situation with indicators like EMA, MACD, RSI, and Fibonacci levels. EMA signals \u2018Sell\u2019, hinting at a bearish trend, with potential support at $3,090.3.\n\nMACD at -47.4 suggests selling due to bearish momentum, while RSI at 41.2 is neutral but near oversold levels. Fibonacci levels indicate support at $3,266.8 and resistance at $3,767.7, offering insights on potential price movements.\n\nFalling below $3,266.8 could lead to further drops, while surpassing $3,767.7 might indicate bullish momentum.\n\nWhat Traders Should Know\n\n1. Stay Informed: Staying updated about Ethereum\u2019s technical upgrades and their schedules is essential. Effective execution of these improvements could signify a significant uptrend.\n\n2. Monitor Institutional Movements: Pay attention to updates from large financial institutions about their participation in Ether. Higher adoption by institutions can result in noticeable price gains.\n\n3. Follow DeFi and NFT Trends: The rise of DeFi and NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem shows the high demand and usefulness of ETH. Monitoring these industries can offer understanding of potential price fluctuations.\n\n4. Regulatory News: Keep informed about regulatory changes happening across the world. Favorable regulatory updates may result in optimistic market outlook, while unfavorable news can elicit the opposite reaction.\n\n5. Technical Analysis: Make use of technical indicators for insight into market trends and possible entry and exit points. This can assist in forming informed decisions when trading\n\nConclusion\n\nthereum faces a critical juncture in 2024, driven by tech advancements, institutional attention, and the evolving DeFi and NFT sectors. Despite current bearish trends, the long-term outlook is optimistic with the upcoming upgrades and potential ETF greenlights. Traders must stay alert to market shifts and regulations to seize Ethereum\u2019s anticipated growth in 2024 through informed decision-making and technical analysis."

        "title": "Ethereum Staking: A Guide to Earning Rewards and Securing Network - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Ethereum, a major cryptocurrency, has become more eco-friendly and secure by using a new system called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This new system lets you earn rewards for just holding onto your Ethereum (ETH) and helping to keep the network safe.\n\nThis guide explains what staking ETH is, how it works, and different ways to do it. Even if you\u2019re new to crypto, this guide will help you understand how staking ETH can be a great way to get involved in the exciting world of Ethereum.\n\nWhat is Ethereum Staking?\n\nEthereum staking is the process of locking ETH on the Ethereum blockchain and participating in verifying transactions. This method sees users locking in their ETH as a \u201cstake\u201d or \u201cdeposit\u201d as a guarantee against them verifying and validating Ethereum transactions.\n\nBy staking ETH, users qualify to become validators with granted privileges of broadcasting transactions on the blockchain, maintaining the distributed database, and securing the network. These validators are rewarded with transaction fees and a predefined yield on their staked amount.\n\nFollowing the Merge upgrade, which went live in September 2022, Ethereum was transited into using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from the Proof-of-Work (PoW). This upgrade marked a significant milestone for ETH which changed its fundamental infrastructure.\n\nBefore the adoption of PoS consensus, Ethereum validators tended to use heavy electricity for verifying transactions just like Bitcoin. Now its electricity consumption is drastically reduced and the network efficiency is improved from the ground level.\n\nBy implementing a staking mechanism, Ethereum has also unlocked numerous economic benefits for its ever-evolving ecosystem. For instance, data from Ultrasound.money shows that the rate of increment in ETH supply has steadily decreased post the Merge upgrade and it is also helping maintaining ETH scarcity by burning significant supply regularly.\n\nBenefits of Staking ETH\n\nEthereum provides numerous benefits to users and entities who wish to participate in staking and securing the blockchain network. Below are some key benefits of staking on Ethereum for users:\n\n1. Passive Rewards\n\nThe primary benefit of staking ETH is getting rewarded in exchange with newly minted ETH as block rewards plus transaction fees. As a validator, users who stake ETH get to verify transactions and add them into blocks. Each of these transactions have associated gas fees which are rewarded to that particular validator who verifies it and adds it to the blockchain network.\n\n2. Network Effects\n\nStaking is a crucial element for PoS blockchain networks like Ethereum as it makes it secure and decentralized. As stakers are responsible for verifying and validating transactions, it is necessary for them to function in a fair and transparent manner so that the security of the blockchain network is preserved.\n\n3. Sustainability\n\nThe amount of staked ETH is periodically locked in the system so that its economical value remains sustained until it is unstaked. This brings prolific sustainability and empowers value creation within the blockchain ecosystem. Locking of ETH also contributes to narrowing the selling pressure in live markets.\n\nHow to Stake ETH\n\nThere are different ways to stake ETH and harness its benefits. All these staking methods are separate from one another on the basis of technicality, reward bars, and ease of implementation.\n\nLet\u2019s understand it all in detail;\n\nSolo Staking\n\nThe method of Solo Staking involves setting up a node on Ethereum with a manual process. It is also known as native staking where stakers directly interact with the Ethereum network. The solo stakers will participate in securing the network all by themselves with their hardware devices to verify and validate transactions.\n\nAlthough it requires 32 ETH as a staking deposit for a node to become a validator and secure the network. Additionally, a sophisticated computer system is also essential for an Ethereum client to run, which is the software containing information on the whole blockchain. Such requirements make solo staking a hefty process and burden to people with no such experience in software engineering.\n\nHowever, this method represents the gold standard for staking on Ethereum with higher responsibilities than other methods and higher staking rewards. To run a node and become a solo staker, it\u2019s recommended to follow the official guide from Ethereum.\n\nStaking as a Service\n\nAs the interest in ETH staking has grown rapidly, many \u201cStaking as a Service\u201d platforms have arrived in the past few years. These platforms allow you to stake ETH as a third-party service provider which then manages all your technical requirements including node set-up and hardware. It means that users can benefit from staking rewards without being worried about running their own validator node on Ethereum.\n\nThis method essentially enables non-technical users to participate in stalking while leaving technical aspects to someone else. All it requires is for users to generate keys and deposit 32 ETH for service providers. In exchange for their service, these staking service providers will charge minimal fees from staking rewards and send back the remaining rewards to users.\n\nStaking Pools\n\nStaking Pools allow individuals to stake a flexible amount of ETH instead of the standard 32 ETH in order to partake into staking. It enables earning staking rewards without the need for extensive technical knowledge or running their validator node. Instead of staking alone, users can send their ETH to a liquidity pool from where combined staking is initiated. Once a pool reaches to 32 ETH by collective deposits from different users, it automatically deploys a node and starts functioning as a validator.\n\nThis innovative staking method makes it possible for users to contribute any ETH amount and secure Ethereum network as a validator. Then the pool operator entity uses all the shared deposits to join the native staking on Ethereum. When staking pools receive rewards, it is distributed to participants in accordance with their initial stake.\n\nStaking on Exchanges\n\nOne of the easiest and most convenient methods of staking ETH is accessing it via centralized crypto exchanges. It involves depositing of ETH to a centralized exchange platform which offers staking facility. This is usually regarded as the safest and most handy staking process as exchanges provide guarantees to users for security as well as rewards.\n\nAlthough the exchanges require to send ETH to their wallets and giveaway asset custody which possesses risk for users. It essentially means that exchanges retain ownership of user\u2019s assets and the risk of loss is increased. Most of the popular exchanges offer staking services to users including Binance, ByBit, Coinbase, and others.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem, staking opens up exciting opportunities for users to participate in blockchain security and earn rewards. Ethereum stays at the forefront of staking with its robust position among blockchain networks. Staking ETH not only offers economic benefits but also contributes to the decentralization, security, and stability of the Ethereum network."

        "title": "Ethereum Set for Speed Boost with EIP-7732 - TipRanks",
        "content": "Ethereum (ETH-USD) is set for a speed boost with EIP-7732. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, is pushing for faster transaction times, and this new proposal could be the key. EIP-7732 aims to make the network faster and more efficient, addressing a growing demand for speed and reliability.\n\nWhat Is EIP-7732?\n\nEthereum developers have introduced EIP-7732 to split the tasks of validators and create a committee to ensure transactions are timely. This proposal could overhaul the block validation process, enhancing both security and speed for the blockchain.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThe core of EIP-7732 is the Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (EPBS). This idea breaks down block creation into two main roles: the consensus proposer and the execution proposer. The consensus proposer selects an execution proposer, who then produces a valid block with essential data like payments or block hashes. A group of validators, called the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC), makes sure the execution proposer submits the block on time. This separation reduces the workload on validators and boosts the network\u2019s efficiency.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nValidators currently juggle both consensus and execution roles within a short time frame, often leading to delays. By splitting these tasks, EIP-7732 allows validators to focus on consensus first and defer execution, improving overall performance. Additionally, this proposal introduces a trust-free exchange between builders and proposers, ensuring payments and valid block inclusion without needing extra middleware.\n\nThe Impact on Transactions\n\nVitalik Buterin emphasizes that a good blockchain user experience relies on fast transaction confirmations. Thanks to previous upgrades like EIP-1559 and the Merge, Ethereum transaction times have dropped to between five and twenty seconds. EIP-7732 could make transactions even faster, rivaling the speed of credit card transactions. However, implementing these changes might require another hard fork, which could introduce backward-incompatible updates.\n\nA Simple Comparison\n\nThink of a busy coffee shop. You order a latte, but the barista has to take your order, make the coffee, and handle the payment all at once. This slows everything down. Now, imagine a system where one person takes the order, another makes the coffee, and a third processes the payment. Everything moves quicker, and you get your coffee faster. That\u2019s what EIP-7732 aims to do for Ethereum.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nEIP-7732 is like a breath of fresh air for Ethereum. By splitting the validation process and making transactions quicker, it\u2019s set to make the whole network way better for everyone using it. These upgrades could make Ethereum more appealing to investors and developers, which means more people might start using it. And as more people jump on board, the price of ETH could go up. Faster transactions and smoother operations could attract lots of new users and projects, boosting Ethereum\u2019s value in the long run.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum\u2019s price is $3,113."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum in GTA 6? It\u2019s All Still Rumors\u2014For Now - Decrypt",
        "content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nRumors that the widely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 will utilize cryptocurrency have been circulating for more than a year now\u2014and they\u2019re swirling again.\n\nOn Wednesday, a pseudonymous Crypto Twitter influencer called Gordon\u2014apparently named after Gordon Gekko from the iconic 1987 film \u201cWall Street\u201d\u2014shared to his nearly 500,000 followers that \u201cGTA 6 will enable cryptocurrency payments,\u201d and that \u201cso far only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT [are] confirmed.\u201d\n\nBut in reality, no cryptocurrencies have been confirmed for Grand Theft Auto 6, despite the ongoing chatter around the rumors. Rockstar Games and parent company Take-Two made no such announcements this week on the matter, nor previously, and the official trailers and announcements have made zero mention of crypto inclusion.\n\nHowever, the tweet\u2014which also included a fake trailer for the game\u2014quickly went viral, with more than 500,000 views as of this writing after just a matter of hours. When Twitter users asked Gordon for his sourcing, he\u2019d jokingly reply that his \u201cuncle works there,\u201d or say that previous reports on the matter were \u201cold\u201d at this point.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFake news. \u2014 BORED (@BoredElonMusk) July 3, 2024\n\nBut in truth, nothing has changed since Decrypt\u2019s GG reported on earlier rumors in May 2023, nor since the first official trailer\u2014which initially leaked with \u201cBUY BTC\u201d stamped on it, apparently by the leaker in question\u2014debuted last December.\n\nDecrypt\u2019s GG reached out to Rockstar Games for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nCould Grand Theft Auto 6 implement a crypto element when it launches in 2025? It\u2019s certainly possible, and if so, it would be a transformative moment for the embrace of cryptocurrency by the traditional gaming industry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTake-Two Interactive has previously explored the space, acquiring casual gaming giant Zynga in early 2022 as Take-Two founder and CEO Strauss Zelnick suggested there were \u201cWeb3 opportunities\u201d they could explore better as a team. Zynga has since launched its first blockchain game on Ethereum, called Sugartown, but Take-Two still hasn\u2019t dabbled with its other brands.\n\nRockstar Games, on the other hand, banned the use of cryptocurrency or NFTs on player-run Grand Theft Auto 5 servers in late 2022, following a surge in the use of NFTs to represent unique, player-owned assets within modified game servers.\n\nAnd given Grand Theft Auto\u2019s satirical tone, the game might be more likely to skewer cryptocurrency and poke fun at caricatures of crypto and NFT die-hards, for example, rather than try to launch its own on-chain coin. But that\u2019s all speculation at this point, as there are relatively few official details around GTA 6.\n\nFor now, at least, don\u2019t believe the hype. While Rockstar Games hasn\u2019t officially closed the door on cryptocurrency being used in Grand Theft Auto 6, it also hasn\u2019t confirmed anything at all on that front. It\u2019s sure to remain a hot topic in the long run-up to release, however, which is currently pegged for fall 2025.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Spot Ethereum ETF arriving in July - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "There is still uncertainty about the date of the actual listing on the stock exchange of spot Ethereum ETFs in the USA, but the chances that this may happen by the end of the month seem to be increasing.\n\nThere are indeed many experts and analysts who expect the definitive landing as early as next week, or in any case within the following two weeks.\n\nThe hypothesis of Galaxy Digital on the imminent approval of Ethereum ETFs\n\nYesterday Bloomberg interviewed the head of asset management at Galaxy Digital Ether ETF, Steve Kurz, who stated that spot Ethereum ETFs are very likely to be definitively approved by the SEC in the current month of July.\n\nAccording to Kurz, the requests are currently in a phase of \u201cwindow dressing\u201d.\n\nThe expert from Galaxy Digital reminded that the SEC has already done this before, and despite being almost identical products to those already approved in January on Bitcoin, he called it a way to embellish the procedure.\n\nIt should be noted that Galaxy Digital is one of the eight companies that has applied to the SEC to issue a spot Ethereum ETF, along with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Fidelity, iShares, Grayscale, and 21Shares.\n\nAll have already received authorization to list the shares of their ETFs on ETH on the stock exchange, but before they can actually be listed and made tradable, they must receive authorization for the S-1 form.\n\nThe window dressing\n\nIn the financial sector, \u201cwindow dressing\u201d refers to the practice of embellishing a portfolio or a balance sheet, for example, by selecting or modifying certain information, in order to make them appear more attractive or better performing.\n\nFor example, in the case of investment portfolios, positions are carefully chosen to present in such a way as to make the portfolio appear more diversified or with better returns.\n\nObviously, it is considered a deceptive practice, or at least not very transparent, because it creates false expectations or gives a distorted image.\n\nIn this specific case the SEC needs somehow to present these ETFs as something positive, given that for years it has stood against both Ethereum and crypto ETFs.\n\nLast year it took a court ruling to force the SEC to approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs, as it had always rejected them in the past, making a mistake.\n\nThis year, however, it is likely that a diktat has come from above, given that it is still a government agency and in a year of presidential elections, evidently the candidate running again (Joe Biden) wanted to avoid irritating investors and the markets.\n\nSo in this specific case, window dressing might not be entirely misleading, even if it involves making formal changes to the requests to make them appear more in line with the expectations of the SEC.\n\nThe landing on the USA stock exchange of Ethereum ETFs\n\nIn the case of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the actual listing on the stock exchange occurred the day after approval.\n\nIn the case of spot Ethereum ETFs, only the requests have been approved for now, but the procedure is not complete. It is necessary for the SEC to also approve the final form, the S-1, which the various applicant companies have already submitted.\n\nTomorrow is the 4th of July, and in the USA it is a national holiday.\n\nFriday it is unlikely that the SEC can meet for final approval, also because before it can do so the window dressing phase must be completed.\n\nIt was expected that the final approval could arrive on Monday, but in the current state, perhaps it is already a lot if it manages to arrive next week.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that once the final overall approval is obtained, the issuing companies will race to list their ETFs on the stock exchange as quickly as possible, and this means that the listing should take place the day after the definitive approval.\n\nThe forecasts\n\nIn reality, the main uncertainty is the one concerning the potential success of these new financial products on the USA stock exchanges.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin in January, the success was resounding, so much so that the price of BTC went from $45,000 to over $70,000.\n\nInstead, in the case of Ethereum, a much more moderate success is expected, although to be honest, the markets seem to be skeptical about a true and proper success of these ETFs on ETH spot.\n\nThe options market on ETH currently shows a positive sentiment regarding the launch of ETFs in the medium/short term, as happened for Bitcoin, but at this moment the Ethereum spot market does not show any bull signs.\n\nThere is therefore a discrepancy, with on one side the spot market that does not seem to be optimistic, while on the other side the derivatives market seems to be.\n\nThe only certain thing is that there is no sign of true and proper euphoria.\n\nAt this point, it is possible to imagine that something similar to what happens in January after the actual stock market debut of the new spot BTC ETFs occurs. That is, a drop in the weeks immediately following, lasting less than 30 days, and then a rebound.\n\nThe sales\n\nThe problem is that with the actual landing on the stock exchange, two waves of selling could be triggered.\n\nThe first is that of those who will do the classic sell-the-news, after having done the buy-the-rumors, given that the news of the approval is not yet 100% certain.\n\nThe second, much more dangerous, is that of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which just like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust could be forced to liquidate a large part of the underlying (ETH) once transformed into an ETF and listed on the stock exchange.\n\nIn January this dynamic lasted less than two weeks, also because then the other ETFs started buying more BTC than Grayscale was liquidating.\n\nSo if the actual listing on the stock exchange of spot Ethereum ETFs should take place around mid-July, it is possible to imagine a drop in the price of ETH until the end of the month, and then perhaps a rebound in August."

        "content": "In the first quarter of the year, Solana-based meme coins have emerged as the frontrunners, surpassing Ethereum\u2019s meme coin ecosystem and artificial intelligence (AI) tokens, according to a recent report by market data platform CoinMarketCap.\n\nThis shift in popularity signifies a change in dynamics within the cryptocurrency market, with meme coins gaining traction and challenging previously dominant narratives such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nSolana Ecosystem Dominates Growth Chart\n\nThe CoinMarketCap report highlights that the Solana ecosystem has consistently topped the growth chart for the past eight months, with over 20 new tokens introduced in Q2 alone.\n\nEthereum\u2019s ecosystem followed closely behind with 14 new tokens, while Derivatives and Stablecoins witnessed relatively lesser growth with 5 and 4 new tokens, respectively. This surge in Solana-based token offerings indicates a growing interest in the network and its potential.\n\nSolana\u2019s meme coin ecosystem, in particular, has gained significant momentum in price performance and popularity since October 2023. Although Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain, Solana\u2019s growing prominence suggests a noteworthy trend in the crypto space.\n\nInterestingly, SOL memes have significantly outperformed ETH memes, delivering an average return of 8,469% compared to 962% for Ethereum, as seen in the chart below.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nAs \u201cspeculative capital\u201d from other chains rushed into Solana, attracted by the explosive rallies of tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK), more meme coins experienced price surges, attracting additional attention and capital.\n\nThe top winners in the meme coin space include the cat characters MEW, POPCAT, and Book of Meme (MEME). These tokens have outperformed even the most popular ones like WIF, BONK, Ethereum\u2019s Pepe coin (PEPE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB).\n\nNotably, political memes also emerged as a popular subcategory, with the leading MAGA (TRUMP) meme coin gaining over 5100% year-to-date, largely due to vocal support for crypto from former President Donald Trump and the acceptance of crypto for campaign donations.\n\nEthereum Tops Fee Income Rankings\n\nDespite Solana\u2019s significant gains, Ethereum continues to dominate the Layer 1 (L1) smart contracts market, representing 62.11% of the major L1s. The report notes that Ethereum\u2019s recent milestone was propelled by the SEC\u2019s approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs.\n\nHowever, Binance Smart Chain (BNB) and Solana have also gained traction, adding $42 billion and $18 billion to their market share among L1 networks. Solana currently leads with over 1.6 million active daily addresses, followed by BNB with 1 million active addresses.\n\nIn Q2, Ethereum experienced record low gas fees, reaching levels not seen since 2020 due to the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions and the market excitement surrounding Solana-based meme coins.\n\nDespite representing 62% of the market cap among major L1s, Ethereum accounted for 70% of the daily revenue, generating approximately $2.7 million. Solana ranked second with around $900,000 in daily revenue.\n\nAccording to Lookonchain, Ethereum topped the fee income rankings in the past year with $2.728 billion, followed by Bitcoin with $1.302 billion.\n\nOther notable networks include Tron ($459.39 million), Solana ($241.29 million), Binance Smart Chain ($176.56 million), Avalanche ($68.83 million), zkSync Era ($59.77 million), Optimism ($40.4 million), and Polygon ($23.91 million).\n\nDespite both platforms experiencing success in various financial metrics and growth charts, Solana\u2019s native token, SOL, has significantly outperformed Ethereum\u2019s ETH token.\n\nAs of the current trading price, SOL is valued at $143.25, showcasing a year-to-date growth of 650%. ETH has seen a more modest surge of 68% during the same time frame, currently trading at $3,310.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com"

Recent claims by a popular Crypto Twitter influencer have reignited speculation, but as of now, there is no official confirmation.\n\nThe Source of the Rumors\n\nOn Wednesday, a pseudonymous Crypto Twitter influencer called Gordon\u2014apparently named after Gordon Gekko from the iconic 1987 film \u201cWall Street\u201d\u2014shared with his nearly 500,000 followers that \u201cGTA 6 will enable cryptocurrency payments,\u201d and that \u201cso far only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT are confirmed.\u201d This tweet quickly went viral, garnering over 500,000 views in just a few hours.\n\n\ud83d\udea8GTA 6 will enable crypto currency payments.\n\n\n\nSo far only Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT confirmed \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/MoYQoppH5z \u2014 Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 3, 2024\n\nThe tweet by Gordon also included a fake trailer for GTA 6, which contributed to its virality. When asked for sources, Gordon humorously replied that his \u201cuncle works there,\u201d or dismissed previous reports as outdated. This playful attitude did little to quell the excitement and speculation among fans and crypto enthusiasts.\n\nDespite the buzz generated by Gordon\u2019s tweet, there has been no official announcement from Rockstar Games or its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, regarding the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in Grand Theft Auto 6. Official trailers and announcements have made no mention of any crypto elements, and Rockstar Games has not responded to inquiries on the matter.\n\nPrevious Rumors and Speculation\n\nThis is not the first time rumors about cryptocurrencies in GTA 6 have surfaced. Earlier speculation in May 2023 suggested similar possibilities, and the game\u2019s first official trailer, which leaked last December, featured a \u201cBUY BTC\u201d stamp\u2014though this was likely added by the leaker. Despite these hints, there has been no substantial evidence to confirm these rumors.\n\nPotential Impact of Cryptocurrency in GTA 6\n\nThe idea of integrating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum into GTA 6 is tantalizing for many. If such features were implemented, it could represent a significant step forward in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency within the gaming industry. This potential has fueled much of the ongoing speculation and interest.\n\nWhile the rumors about Bitcoin and Ethereum in Grand Theft Auto 6 continue to swirl, they remain unconfirmed at this time. For now, fans will have to wait for official news from Rockstar Games and hold on to their excitement as the game\u2019s 2025 release date approaches."

        "content": "Asset managers are optimistic about Security and Exchange Commission approval for the first U.S. ETFs directly investing in Ethereum, possibly by mid-July.\n\nThe SEC has given ETF applicants until July 8 to submit updated paperwork and amended S-1s, with potential additional rounds of filings.\n\nThere may be an additional round of filings after the one due on July 8, reported Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th. Potential final S-1s by July 12th. Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th. via @emily_graffeo @olgakharif pic.twitter.com/NG8xhtCP21 \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2024\n\nEthereum ETF Hopefuls\n\nRecent SEC feedback to issuers involved minor questions, which are being addressed, the report added.\n\nHead of asset management at Galaxy Digital, Steve Kurz, told Bloomberg that an Ether ETF could potentially be approved within the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is window-dressing, the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now. We did it for the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2013 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nMajor asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark 21Shares, and Invesco have pending filings, but many issuers have yet to disclose their fund fees, which is a necessary step before trading begins.\n\nIt is also unclear if Ethereum ETFs will generate demand similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed $52 billion in assets since they launched in January.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that the Ethereum ETF flows could be around 10% to 15% of Bitcoin ETF flows and that ETH prices may fall as much as 30% following their launch.\n\nHowever, crypto research firm K33 Research expects Ethereum to outperform Bitcoin in July.\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader,\u201d wrote K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde in a July 2 report.\n\nBitcoin is facing potential selling pressure from a forthcoming distribution of almost $9 billion worth of BTC related to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nETH Price Declines\n\nEthereum prices are not showing any positive momentum today. The asset fell 3% to an intraday low of $3,342 during Asian trading on Wednesday.\n\nETH topped $3,500 in a ten-day high earlier this week but shadowed its big brother as crypto markets failed to break resistance and retreated once again.\n\nEthereum is currently 17% down from its 2024 peak of just over $4,000 and 31% down from its November 2021 all-time high."

        "content": "Thu 04 Jul 2024 \u25aa 3 min read \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nThe race for revenue in the crypto universe is intensifying, with Ethereum taking a considerable lead over its historical rival, Bitcoin. Ether generated $2.728 billion, while BTC followed with $1.302 billion, illustrating a new dynamic in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nEthereum dominates the Blockchain revenue landscape\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain has established itself as the undisputed leader in terms of fee revenue, surpassing Bitcoin. Its exceptional performance of $2.728 billion over the past year illustrates its dominance in the Decentralized Applications (dApps) and smart contracts ecosystem.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 proved to be particularly lucrative for Ethereum, with its revenue reaching $365 million, marking a remarkable year-on-year growth of 155%. This spectacular rise is mainly due to the boom in innovative sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nEthereum\u2019s transaction fee revenue reached a record high of $1.17 billion in the first quarter, marking an 80% increase over the previous quarter.\n\nBitcoin: A giant that remains in the race\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum in terms of revenue, Bitcoin maintains its position of strength with $1.302 billion generated through transaction fees.\n\nThe introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals has played a crucial role in this performance, leading to a notable increase in transaction fees. Furthermore, the Runes technology has contributed significantly, accounting for up to 68% of Bitcoin transactions since the last Halving.\n\nDespite its primary function as a store of value and medium of exchange, Bitcoin proves its ability to generate substantial revenue. This resilience testifies to its growing adoption and persistent importance in the crypto landscape, beyond its status as a benchmark digital asset.\n\nIn sum, the future looks promising for these two leading cryptos. With the imminent launch of Ethereum ETFs and the continued growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, analysts foresee significant capital inflows in the coming months.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

According to the latest updates, Bitwise has filed an amended version of its S-1 form with the SEC! Signaling a decisive step towards the introduction of a spot Ethereum ETF as early as this July.\n\nIs the Ethereum ETF arriving this July 15?\n\nThe ETF, which allows investors to access Ethereum without directly holding the crypto, is eagerly awaited by the financial community. Analysts predict that SEC approval could come as early as mid-July, with a potential target date set for July 15. This anticipation is based on the recent update of Bitwise\u2019s S-1 form, which includes a fee waiver for the first six months up to a cap of 500 million dollars.\n\nNo one really knows why the SEC is taking their sweet time with these, given how light comments were, these could have easily been trading by now. Could be one 'problem' issuer slowing down process or just summertime lazy/ppl on vaca. Not sure. That said, all indications launch\u2026 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 3, 2024\n\nThe SEC, which already gave the green light to spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, appears ready to extend this approval to Ethereum. This represents a significant evolution for crypto, as Ethereum is often considered to have higher growth potential due to its extensive applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts.\n\nA launch eagerly awaited by the crypto community\n\nThe launch of the Ethereum ETF by Bitwise could mark a turning point for crypto investment. It will offer a new regulated and simplified path for institutional and individual investors. This could also signal increased recognition of the value and legitimacy of digital assets in the traditional financial system.\n\nAs the probable launch date approaches, the industry is closely monitoring the developments. If everything goes as planned, Bitwise\u2019s Ethereum ETF could very well be the catalyst for a new era of crypto investment, accessible to a broader audience and integrated into the global financial framework.\n\nThe launch of the Ethereum ETF by Bitwise is a highly anticipated event that could transform the crypto investment landscape. With the SEC poised to give its approval, the financial world is on high alert, ready to welcome this new era of financial innovation.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

And make it clear that while Bitcoin competes with gold, Ethereum is a centre of technological development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy for me to imagine investors selling a small amount of their tech exposure and adding Ether,\u201d Hougan said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d argue it\u2019s easier than imagining investors carving out an entirely separate portfolio sleeve for a new monetary asset [like Bitcoin,]\u201d he added.\n\nHougan isn\u2019t the only one advocating for Ethereum ETFs to be marketed that way\n\nEthereum ETFs will serve as proxy vehicles to anyone seeking exposure to everything that has to do with blockchain, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, stated on X.\n\nThat would include tokenisation, smart contracts, DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs.\n\n\u201cRemember that old saying \u2018I believe in blockchain, but I\u2019m not sure about Bitcoin.\u2019 Now that expression is accessible for traditional investors,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent for DL News.

Around 12 pm today, it was trading at $61,035.66. The slide in BTC had an impact on other altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Tether, Dogecoin , Avalanche, and Shiba Inu which were down by up to 2.5%.Altcoins that were trading in the green around this time included Solana, XRP , Toncoin, Cardano, and Tron which gained up to 2%.The crypto market's lackluster trade could be attributed to the remarks by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish statement which said that the Central Bank needs more evidence on inflation to decide on the timing of the rate cuts. Moreover, the May jobs data was reported higher-than-expected.Bitcoin's decline reflects both concerns and opportunities in the crypto market, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO at Unocoin said as he highlighted strong trading volume of $20 billion over the past day, indicating significant market activity. \"The news suggests that large holders of Bitcoin, known as whales, are piling up, indicating confidence in a potential year-end rally,\" he said.Vishwanath said that BTC is currently finding support within an ascending channel of around $61,700 though it faces resistance at the 50-day EMA at $62,210, suggesting a limited immediate upside. \"With the RSI at 48, indicating neutral sentiment, the market is depending on Bitcoin's ability to hold above $61,700 to avoid a deeper decline to the $60,700 and $60,000 support levels,\" he added.Source: CoinMarketCapOn the BTC price movement, CoinDCX Research Team in a note said that the current drop filled most of the weekend BTC CME gap, though another gap remains around $59,700-$59,800 which suggests that BTC could drop further to fill it.Currently, Solana is outperforming BTC and ETH due to ETF hype, the note said, adding that the market is slightly negative due to bearishness in BTC.\"Bitcoin has been consolidating around $61,000 for the past 24 hours, following some profit-taking by traders. It's having a hard time breaking past the $63,600 resistance level. If it doesn't manage to hold its current position, Bitcoin might drop back to the $60,800 support level, with bulls trying to keep it above that mark,\" Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex warned.He pins his hopes on approval to Ether ETFs which he said could improve the market sentiments.Also Read: Gold\u2019s 13% uptick beats Nifty's H1CY24 gains.

However, the firm has not yet disclosed the fee structure that will apply after this threshold is reached. This competitive pricing strategy aims to attract initial investors to the product.\n\nFor instance, VanEck and others are offering similar waivers implying competition among these new financial instruments available for investment purposes.

Yet, there is still a key support level that can provide the staging grounds for a recovery.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn the daily chart, the price has been trending lower inside a large descending channel pattern. In the last few days, the market has failed to reclaim the $3,500 level, and it dropped lower following a bearish rejection.\n\nCurrently, a decline toward the $3,000 support level, which coincides with both the lower boundary of the channel and the 200-day moving average, could be expected.\n\nWhile this confluence of support elements makes $3,000 a strong support zone, if it gets broken down, things can get much worse very quickly.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nThe 4-hour timeframe shows a clear picture of the price\u2019s rejection from the $3,500 resistance level. The $3,350 short-term support zone is also getting broken to the downside, making $3,000 a probable upcoming target for ETH.\n\net, investors should keep an eye on the RSI, as it has entered the oversold region, which could point to a potential recovery soon.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nBy TradingRage\n\nTaker Buy Sell Ratio\n\nAnalyzing the futures market metrics for Ethereum can be a great complement to price analysis. This chart demonstrates one of the most useful futures market metrics, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio.\n\nIt measures whether the buyers or sellers are more aggressive in executing their orders on aggregate.\n\nAs the chart demonstrates, following the rejection from the $4,000 level, a huge volume of market sell orders has been executed in the futures market, bringing the Taker Buy Sell Ratio to its lowest value in the past few months. This indicates that futures market traders believe the price will be dropping even lower in the short term."

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nEthereum (ETH) has faced significant declines, currently around $3,200, but some analysts remain bullish, predicting potential rebounds and an all-time high of $8,000.\n\nThe upcoming launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, expected to attract $3-$5 billion in net inflows, could boost investor confidence and drive ETH\u2019s price higher, similar to the impact seen with spot BTC ETFs earlier this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for ETH?\n\nEthereum (ETH), similar to many other leading cryptocurrencies, has been severely affected by the latest market correction. Its price currently hovers at around $3,200 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), representing a 5% daily decline and 15% on a monthly scale.\n\nAccording to some industry participants, though, the negative trend may soon be replaced by a fresh uptick. The X user Poseidon claimed the \u201cfuture is bright,\u201d and ETH is poised for an all-time high of $8,000.\n\nCaptain Faibik was also bullish, forecasting that the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency \u201cwill bounce back hard,\u201d meaning it currently offers a great \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some worrying signs that Ethereum\u2019s freefall may continue in the coming days. The popular crypto analyst, using the X handle Crypto Tony, claimed that everything would be under control as long as ETH\u2019s valuation remains above $3,270. The asset lost that resistance level a few hours ago.\n\nWaiting for the ETF Launch\n\nOne important factor that could place ETH back into green territory is the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs (expected this month). Recall that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple such products earlier this year, but they are not yet live.\n\nAccording to crypto exchange Gemini, the official introduction of spot ETH ETFs in America could attract net inflows in the range of $3-$5 billion within the first six months of trading.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nCryptoPotato\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for ETH?\n\nEthereum (ETH), similar to many other leading cryptocurrencies, has been severely affected by the latest market correction. Its price currently hovers at around $3,200 (per CoinGecko\u2019s data), representing a 5% daily decline and 15% on a monthly scale.\n\nAccording to some industry participants, though, the negative trend may soon be replaced by a fresh uptick. The X user Poseidon claimed the \u201cfuture is bright,\u201d and ETH is poised for an all-time high of $8,000.\n\nCaptain Faibik was also bullish, forecasting that the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency \u201cwill bounce back hard,\u201d meaning it currently offers a great \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some worrying signs that Ethereum\u2019s freefall may continue in the coming days. The popular crypto analyst, using the X handle Crypto Tony, claimed that everything would be under control as long as ETH\u2019s valuation remains above $3,270. The asset lost that resistance level a few hours ago.Waiting for the ETF Launch\n\nOne important factor that could place ETH back into green territory is the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs (expected this month). Recall that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)approvedmultiple such products earlier this year, but they are not yet live.\n\nAccording to crypto exchange Gemini, the official introduction of spot ETH ETFs in America could attract net inflows in the range of $3-$5 billion within the first six months of trading. The move might improve the asset\u2019s market position, moving it closer to the leader Bitcoin (BTC), the analysis reads.\n\nSpot ETFs will make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly.

As reported by CoinMarketCap, ETH, at press time, dropped by 1.11% over the last 24 hours.\n\nHowever, despite this recent downturn, technical indicators like MACD and RSI suggested a potential shift from sellers to buyers.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum was approaching a critical resistance level at around $3538, and a breakthrough could signal the onset of a bullish phase for the largest altcoin.\n\nWhy is ETH down?\n\nProviding some light on the current price situation of ETH, analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart confirmed that the SEC has set a new deadline \u2014 the 8th of July \u2014 for submission of the forms.\n\n\u201cUnfort think we gonna have to push back our over/under till after holiday. Sounds like SEC took extra time to get back to ppl this wk (altho again very light tweaks) and from what I hear next wk is dead bc holiday = July 8th the process resumes and soon after that they\u2019ll launch @JSeyff.\u201d\n\nCommunity reaction\n\nNeedless to say, this news was not received well by the community, who echoed a sentiment similar to ETF Store president Nate Geraci,\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take this long.\u201d\n\nTherefore, to reassure the community, Eric Balchunas said,\n\nAs the latest trend unfolds, the crypto community is once again on edge, eagerly anticipating the approval of the ETH ETF.\n\n@StrongHedge best put it when he said,"

Currently, this trader is on the verge of liquidation, the tweet states, while he is about to lose the more than $30 million in crypto that he borrowed.\n\nEthereum (ETH) whale on verge of liquidation\n\nAccording to the data source, this whale deposited 12,374 ETH to Compound, while he borrowed $31.4 million stablecoins. @lookonchain says that should the Ethereum price continue to decline, once it falls to the $2,984 level, this whale\u2019s long positions will be liquidated.\n\nAs the market declines, the whale who is long $ETH is on the verge of liquidation!\n\n\n\nHe deposited 12,734 $ETH($40M) to #Compound and borrowed $31.4M stablecoins, with a health rate of only 1.06.\n\n\n\nWhen the price of $ETH drops to $2,984, he will be liquidated.\n\n\n\nAddress:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lP9877HjCJ \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2024\n\nIn the meantime, another whale grabbed 9,425 ETH worth slightly more than $30 million earlier today. @lookonchain stated that it was a fresh wallet. The whale made a purchase of a dozen other cryptocurrencies, including BNB, MATIC, LINK, AVAX and top meme coins, such as Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe Coin and Floki.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, it bought and withdrew a whopping $120 million worth of altcoins from the largest cryptocurrency platform, Binance.

This drop was followed by a marginal rise and then another price decline of 3.09%.\n\nEthereum has been following the recent price decline of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, which has been going down heavily since Monday. Analyst Charles Edwards published a tweet, in which he shared that the Bitcoin price keeps going down as major players continue to dump Bitcoin. Mostly, these are miners who are selling freshly mined BTC and their old Bitcoin reserves.\n\nLong-term holders are actively selling their BTC as well. Overall, according to the Glassnode data shared by Edwards, currently, there is a 374,000 Bitcoin negative flow. That is, approximately $24 billion worth of Bitcoin is being dumped on the market at the moment.\n\nThe U.S. and German governments have recently sold several large amounts of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to earlier U.Today reports."

        "content": "In the last two weeks, investors have pulled out $120 million from ETH-focused investment products.\n\nEther spot ETF launch timeline has been moved after the SEC asked issuers to resubmit amended S-1 drafts.\n\nEthereum [ETH] was trading at around $3,448 on the 2nd of July, barely unchanged in the last few hours but in conformance with the generally positive July narrative.\n\nIn the meantime, ETH bulls targeted fresh heights above $3,450 and were betting on upside potential from the hype around Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe new products, expected to debut in the U.S. later this month, could help propel ETH/USDT above the $3,630 resistance, where it was rejected on the 17th of June.\n\nBullish speculators suffered mild losses on the 1st of July after Ethereum failed to sustain momentum above $3,520.\n\nETH attempted to break out from the descending channel on the 4-hour timeframe chart overnight on the day, but as of press time, has been unable to cement the move.\n\nMarkedly, the latest advance toward $3,500 will not amount to triumph for bulls if ETH is unable to sail above the $3,520 \u2014 $3,550 resistance zone.\n\nEthereum institutional uptake\n\nIn its digital asset flows report released on Monday, CoinShares observed that Ethereum investment products posted outflows of $60.7 million last week.\n\nThe figure marked the most significant negative 7-day flow in almost two years, and brought the cumulative two-week outflows to $119 million.\n\nThe report further highlighted that Ethereum was the worst-performing crypto asset in 2024, based on net flows, with\u2014$37 million and\u2014$25 million MTD and YTD flows, respectively.\n\nU.S. Ethereum spot ETF\n\nA U.S. Ether spot ETF has been nigh this summer after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 19b-4 filings of eight prospective issuers on the 23rd of May.\n\nStill, the ETF products are yet to be cleared to go live, pending approval of the S-1 registration statements.\n\nThe latest setback in the approval process has been laid at the door of the U.S. securities regulator. Last week, the SEC reviewed S-1 forms from issuers and requested resubmissions incorporating its comments by the 8th of July.\n\nConsequently, the timeline for the launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs has been pushed to mid-or end of July.\n\nMarket anticipation\n\nLast week, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra forecasted that Ether spot ETFs will see slightly lower demand when they go live, compared to Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs, since they mostly share the same sources of demand.\n\nThe co-authors also cited \u201cthe lack of an ETH staking feature\u201d in the approved spot Ether ETFs as a deterrent that could dampen interest in the products.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have thus far attracted $55 billion since their introduction at the start of the year.\n\nThough inflows have waned from the February highs, analyst projections show that the figure is expected to eclipse $100 billion by the end of 2025.\n\nJ.P. Morgan, on the other hand, forecasted that Ether ETFs could see net inflows of about $3 billion ($6 billion if staking is permitted) by the end of the year.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nJ.P. Morgan also expected the market\u2019s immediate reception to be mildly negative, citing possible profit-taking by investors who bought the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) in expectation of its conversion to an ETF.\n\nSeparately, in the last week, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan projected that Ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would draw in $15 billion of net inflows in the first dozen and a half months."

The amendments will take effect on July 5.\n\nThe company did not provide an exact reason for the delisting effort, reminding that it periodically reviews all listed spot trading pairs and removes some in case of poor liquidity or other factors.\n\nThe majority of the affected cryptocurrencies are in the red today (July 3). Their poor performance coincides with the sector\u2019s overall decline. According to CoinGecko\u2019s data, the global crypto market capitalization is currently standing at around $2.35 trillion, a 3.5% plunge compared to the figure observed the day before.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price retraced toward the $60K mark, while Ethereum (ETH) dipped to approximately $3,300.\n\nContrary to halting services for some existing trading pairs, Binance recently included some new ones in its platform. WIF/BRL, ZK/USDC, and ZRO/USDC were added to Binance Spot. It is worth noting that the service is not available to all clients:\n\n\u201cCurrently, users residing in the following countries or regions will not be able to trade the above-mentioned spot trading pair(s): Canada, Cuba, Crimea Region, Iran, Netherlands, North Korea, Syria, United States of America, and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands), and any non-government controlled areas of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPrevious Binance Announcements\n\nThe exchange has enforced numerous similar changes since the beginning of the year. Last month, it ceased trading services with the following pairs: ALPACA/BTC, NFP/TUSD, MDX/BTC, QUICK/BTC, and XAI/BNB.\n\nA few months before, Binance terminated all operations involving Monero (XMR). The move was followed by a price crash for the popular privacy coin."

        "content": "Ethereum price remained in a bearish zone below $3,250 zone. ETH dived below the $3,000 support and even tested the $2,850 zone.\n\nEthereum started a fresh decline below the $3,120 and $3,000 levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could correct losses, but upsides might be limited above the $3,120 zone.\n\nEthereum Price Dives 8%\n\nEthereum price failed to start a recovery wave above the $3,150 and $3,200 resistance levels. ETH started another decline below the $3,120 support zone like Bitcoin. There was a move below the $3,050 and $3,000 support levels.\n\nThe price declined 8% and even tested the $2,850 support. A low was formed at $2,862 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is showing a lot of bearish signs and trading well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 swing high to the $2,860 low.\n\nEthereum is trading below $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $2,960 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,000 level.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,000 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The next major hurdle is near the $3,120 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 swing high to the $2,860 low.\n\nNewsBTC\n\nA close above the $3,120 level might send Ether toward the $3,200 resistance. The next key resistance is near $3,250. An upside break above the $3,250 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,350 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near $2,850. The first major support sits near the $2,800 zone.\n\nA clear move below the $2,800 support might push the price toward $2,720. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $2,850\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $3,000"

        "title": "Hops on the Blockchain: How Ethereum Is Revolutionizing the Beer Industry - Washington Beer Blog",
        "content": "Image from pexels.com.\n\nFor many years, beer has been something that helps people relax and enjoy social events. It is also a sign of celebration and an important part of different cultures. However, how beer goes from the farm to your glass can be quite mysterious.\n\nMany people who love their favorite beers do not know much about where these drinks come from, how the ingredients are sourced, or what kind of effect making them has on the environment. This lack of clear information is becoming more and more worrisome for buyers, especially because craft beer is getting very popular nowadays.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Ethereum. It is the second-biggest blockchain platform globally and it can\u2019t be said for sure what will the Ethereum price prediction tomorrow will be. But one thing we know is that its ability to change the beer industry cannot be ignored. This new technology has great potential for changing how we keep records of beer, comprehend its history and relate with those who make it \u2013 all in a way that could greatly benefit this thriving sector.\n\nTransparency From Grain to Glass\n\nImagine picking up your favorite IPA and raising a glass, knowing exactly where every hop in that brew was grown \u2013 right down to the specific farm, their green methods and even when they were harvested. With Ethereum blockchain technology, this is possible now. Brewers can use this technology to note each step in making beer, starting from getting raw materials like hops and barley all the way to putting the finished beer into bottles.\n\nThis information is then kept safe on a digital ledger that nobody can alter, and anyone can see. People who buy the beer use simple apps to check this data, making sure where their beer came from and how good it is. This openness builds trust between brewers and customers, allowing the customers to make smart buying choices that match their values.\n\nA Toast to Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability\n\nMany consumers now want to support businesses that are ethical and have sustainable practices. Blockchain can be very useful for making sure there is transparency in these aspects. Breweries dedicated to using organic ingredients can place this data on the blockchain, giving consumers verifiable evidence.\n\nAdditionally, this technology has the ability to track the carbon footprint of beer throughout the whole supply chain. This helps breweries find places where they can do better and do less harm to the environment. Picture a world where lovers of craft beer can pick their favorite drink, knowing it was made with little harm to the environment \u2013 making both their taste buds and the planet happy.\n\nStreamlining Distribution: Smart Contracts for a Smoother Brew\n\nIn the beer distribution world, there is a complicated web of breweries, distributors and retailers. These parties often face inefficiencies such as errors in orders or invoices due to miscommunication between them.\n\nEthereum\u2019s smart contracts can solve this issue by automating tasks like ordering from the brewery, creating an invoice for the distributor and making payment \u2013 all executed without any need for human intervention. This not only cuts down on administrative expenses but also gets rid of mistakes and hold-ups linked to conventional ways.\n\nConsider a situation in which a distributor automatically places an order for more of a well-liked IPA from a brewery whenever the inventory levels decrease, all because of a smart contract. This method greatly enhances efficiency for each participant involved \u2013 starting with the brewer up to the distributor and eventually ending at the consumer who receives their preferred beer more swiftly.\n\nCraft Beer Goes Global\n\nFor craft breweries, the main problem they encounter in exporting their beers is the complicated regulations and huge amount of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help with this by creating an easy-to-use system for international trade that guarantees safety and prevents any changes to documents or transactions.\n\nFor small breweries, this might be a game-changer. They can make use of it to enter new markets and distribute their special brews all over the world. Picture a dedicated craft brewer in Seattle smoothly exporting their IPA that won awards to a beer festival in Europe, with blockchain dealing with all required paperwork without any issues.\n\nBig Beer Embraces Blockchain\n\nThe craft beer market is perfect for blockchain, yet big players are also becoming interested. In 2018, it was said that Anheuser-Busch InBev \u2013 the biggest brewer globally \u2013 utilized Ethereum to monitor advertising details about its Budweiser brand. This shows how blockchain can be beneficial even for the largest businesses in this industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a company to last for the next 100 plus years and that can only be done by disrupting existing paradigms through innovation and putting consumers at the heart of everything we do,\u201d said Lucas Herscovici, AB InBev\u2019s Global Marketing Vice President of Consumer Connections, Insights and Innovation.\n\n\u201cWhen we started digging into the potential of blockchain, we began to realize that if Kiip was started today, it would be built on blockchain technology,\u201d said Brian Wong, founder and CEO of Kiip, a leading ad tech and data platform powering mobile advertising. \u201cBlockchain\u2019s magical impact comes in the form of its immutable and decentralized ledger technology. Data that is stored uniquely in thousands of servers can never be manipulated. We saw this technology\u2019s potential to impact several major areas of the advertising world, including supply-chain transparency, campaign data reconciliation and viewability verification. Single Ledger, quite frankly, is just the beginning for us.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Budweiser\u2019s move to purchase the domain name \u201cBeer.eth\u201d for 30 ETH (around $81,000 at the time) and an NFT art piece for 8 ETH (around $21,000) further highlights the growing interest in blockchain within the beer industry.\n\nBrewing a Brighter Future\n\nWhile blockchain technology gives exciting possibilities, there are issues to think about before it can be used everywhere. One main problem is scalability \u2013 for example, the Ethereum network sometimes gets crowded and this might make transaction processing slower.\n\nGovernments must solve complex regulatory challenges as they figure out how to fit blockchain technology into current legal systems. And also, it is very important that consumers learn about this technology. Many people still do not know much about blockchain, so brewers must find good methods to explain the advantages of this technology.\n\nA Toast to Innovation\n\nEven with these difficulties, the possible advantages of blockchain for the beer industry are clear. By making things transparent, encouraging honest sourcing and improving the distribution process, blockchain can give more power to both brewers and people who buy beer.\n\nAs technology becomes better and these problems are solved, we can see even more new uses coming up. The future of beer appears very promising, with the addition of blockchain making things clearer, smoother and more fun for all people taking part in it.\n\nImagine a future where breweries can make interactive experiences on the blockchain. This way, people can go on virtual tours of hop farms or join special beer releases with safe token ownership. The chances for fun and new ideas are really without limit.\n\nDedicated to working together, creating new ideas and learning continuously, blockchain technology can change the beer industry greatly. This will make everything more connected, eco-friendly and enjoyable for everyone involved \u2013 from the enthusiastic brewers making the beer to those who truly appreciate drinking it.\n\nSo, next time you open a chilled drink, take a short moment to think about the journey it made to be there. Maybe with blockchain technology, someday you\u2019ll even track that path yourself\u2014from \u201chops on the blockchain\u201d to delightful sips."

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum is selling off when writing, looking at the performance in the daily chart. Even though the uptrend remains, since gains of May 20 weren\u2019t wiped clean, there are cracks developing. These fissures are widening after ETH closed below $3,300 today, confirming yesterday\u2019s losses. If the dump continues, the probability of the coin crashing to as low as $3,000 would be elevated, denting sentiment.\n\nAt press time, Ethereum is bearish, breaking below a critical support level. As things stand, Ethereum is down 5% in the last day and week. Since the coin is in red, there have been changes in trend; the coin is sliding on rising participation. Over the last day, the average trading volume rose to over $18 billion. This points to traders flowing in, possibly unloading.\n\nTraders and investors are monitoring the following Ethereum trending news:\n\nGTA 6, the popular video game, reports show that it will support other crypto assets apart from BTC , ETH, and USDT. The expansion of the number of coins accepted is a huge boost as far as adoption is concerned.\n\nCircle and Paxos are now regulated in the European Union, compliant with MiCA laws . Meanwhile, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale, one of the largest banks in France, is launching its stablecoins on Ethereum. More TradFi companies are choosing the first smart contracts platform over modern solutions like Solana.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nETH/USD is under immense selling pressure, looking at the performance in the daily chart.\n\nWith the drop of July 3 and early today, every high below $3,300 could offer entries for aggressive sellers targeting $3,000 in the short term.\n\nSince the drop was comprehensive, the probability of ETH sliding below $3,000 to as low as $2,800 remains elevated.\n\nNotice that the gains of May 20 are yet to be completely erased, giving hope to optimistic Ethereum buyers.\n\nIf ETH unexpectedly picks up momentum, winding up recent gains, and breaks $3,500, it would be a huge boost for bulls."

        "content": "Bitcoin price encounters resistance around the $64,000 daily resistance level.\n\nEthereum price experiences rejection as it meets the descending trendline around the $3,500 level.\n\nRipple price faces resistance at $0.500, its daily resistance level.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) faces resistance near the $64,000 daily level, leading to a 1.05% decline in trading on Wednesday. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) similarly encounter resistance, resulting in 1% and 0.5% declines, respectively.\n\nBitcoin price finds hurdle around the $64,000 level\n\nBitcoin price was rejected by the daily resistance level at $63,956 on Monday and trades down 1.05% at $61,488 on Wednesday.\n\nIf BTC's price closes above the hurdle at the $63,956 daily resistance level, it could rise 5% to retest its next weekly resistance at $67,147.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are below their neutral levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed returning, then both momentum indicators must regain their positions above their respective neutral levels.\n\nIf the bulls are aggressive and the overall crypto market outlook is positive, BTC could extend an additional rally of 6% to revisit its weekly resistance at $71,280.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC closes below the $58,375 level and forms a lower low in the daily time frame, it could indicate that bearish sentiment persists. Such a development may trigger a 3% decline in Bitcoin's price, to revisit its low of $56,522 from May 1.\n\nEthereum price experiences rejection by the descending trendline\n\nEthereum price was rejected by the descending trendline on Monday and is now 1% lower on Wednesday, reaching $3,386. This descending trendline is drawn from joining multiple swing highs from June 9 to July 1.\n\nIf ETH breaks above the descending trendline around the $3,500 level, it could rise 5.5% from the breakout point to tag its previous high of $3,717 on June 9.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator in the daily chart are below their neutral levels of 50 and zero. If bulls are indeed returning, then both momentum indicators must maintain their positions above their respective neutral levels.\n\nIf ETH closes above $3,717, the high of June 9, it could extend an additional rally of 7% to reach its previous resistance level of $3,977.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethereum's daily candlestick closes below the $3,240 level, it would produce a lower low and signal a break in the market structure. This move would invalidate the aforementioned bullish thesis, potentially triggering an extra 12% crash to the previous support level of $2,862.\n\nRipple price struggles at the $0.50 level\n\nRipple price currently trades at $0.483, below the daily resistance level of $0.50.If Ripple's price surpasses the barrier at $0.50, it could rise 7% from $0.50 to $0.532, its previous high from June 5.\n\nIn the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50 mark, indicating neutral to bearish sentiment, while the Awesome Oscillator (AO) remains below zero, suggesting bearish momentum. Both indicators must rise above their critical thresholds of 50 for RSI and zero for AO for a sustained bullish trend. Such a development would bolster the ongoing recovery rally in the market.\n\nIf the XRP daily candlestick closes above $0.532, it could extend an additional 9% rally to $0.581, a 50% price retracement level of $0.419 and $0.744 from March 11 to April 13.\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart\n\nConversely, if Ripple price daily candlestick closes below $0.450, marking the June 7 low, it would invalidate the bullish outlook by establishing a lower low on the daily chart. This scenario might lead to a 7% decline in XRP's price towards the April 13 low of $0.419."

        "title": "Ethereum ETFs vs. Bitcoin ETFs: How Their Approvals Differ - CoinGape",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved a spot Ethereum ETF, bringing jubilation to the crypto community. This development follows the approval of Bitcoin ETFs which took place slightly over a year ago. Both approvals are important milestones for the digital assets, but the differences in processes and implications of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs are notable. Let\u2019s explore the differences between these two significant approvals and their implications for the future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBreaking Down the Approval Processes\n\nWhen the SEC gave a go a head for the operations of spot Bitcoin spot ETFs, the event was embedded in the history of the cryptocurrency world. The acceptance signaled Bitcoin\u2019s shift from a specialized virtual asset to a commonly-used investment option.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInvestors now have the opportunity to access Bitcoin through a regulated product, without requiring digital wallets or unregulated exchanges. This endorsement confirmed Bitcoin\u2019s status as a valid asset category and established a model for upcoming cryptocurrency offerings.\n\nSkipping ahead to May 2024, the SEC\u2019s endorsement of spot Ethereum ETFs takes a different path. Despite being a significant milestone, Ethereum\u2019s approval is overshadowed by continued discussions regarding whether it should be classified as a security.\n\nIn contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has faced regulatory challenges on its approval journey, which aligns with ongoing talks about regulating digital assets, indicating a more complex regulatory landscape.\n\nEthereum ETF vs Bitcoin: Market Reactions and Investor Sentiment\n\nThe market saw an instant and significant impact following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin price increased dramatically, and the amount of trading rose as both institutional and individual investors showed interest in the innovative investment option.\n\nThis response highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s position as a top digital asset and showed how cryptocurrencies can blend with conventional financial systems\n\nEthereum\u2019s approval has similarly generated excitement, with Ethereum price rising beyond expectation. The potential introduction of Ethereum ETFs promises to broaden its investor base and enhance market credibility.\n\nHowever, the exact timeline for these ETFs and the participants involved remain uncertain, creating a dynamic environment for ETH\u2019s price and market behavior.\n\nNavigating Regulatory Terrain\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Regulatory Hurdles\n\nThere were challenges in approving Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC investigated to prevent market manipulation and ensure investor protection. Bitcoin\u2019s strong market presence and increasing attention from institutional investors were key factors in overcoming regulatory hurdles, despite the difficulties faced.\n\nEthereum ETF Unique Regulatory Landscape\n\nThe regulatory journey of Ethereum has been somewhat complicated. This is because, unlike Bitcoin, the wide range of applications offered by platform, has an ongoing debate on how to classify the ETH.\n\nThe complexity of Ethereum ecosystem which includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi), is demonstrated by the approval of its ETF by the SEC. This decision shows the need for a more advanced regulatory approach in the changing world of digital assets.\n\nEthereum ETF vs Bitcoin: Implications for the Future\n\nThe acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs set an important standard for investing in cryptocurrencies. It showed that digital assets could be included in traditional financial products, opening the door to upcoming advancements and regulations in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, the approval of Ethereum\u2019s ETF highlights the increasing importance of its wide range of uses. Apart from simply being a digital asset, Ethereum\u2019s participation in DeFi and NFTs showcases its ability to spark more innovation in the financial industry.\n\nThis approval may speed up integrations and developments, strengthening Ethereum\u2019s significance in the changing crypto environment.\n\nLooking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities\n\nThe approval of cryptocurrency ETFs signifies a major step forward in incorporating digital assets into traditional finance. These advancements are anticipated to stimulate creativity and broaden the applications of cryptocurrencies, impacting market trends and investor actions.\n\nThe timing and authorization of these ETFs also indicate more general political and regulatory factors. As the regulatory landscape keeps changing, focusing on centralization and establishing strong frameworks will be crucial for maintaining the expansion and adoption of digital assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile both Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF approvals mark important milestones, their differing paths highlight unique aspects of each cryptocurrency\u2019s journey toward mainstream acceptance. As the crypto market evolves, these approvals will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital asset investments and their integration into traditional financial systems."

According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, Ethereum ETFs are expected to become available for trading as early as July 15th.\n\nGeraci stated that with the revised S-1 submission for Ethereum ETFs to happen in July, the final S-1 approval from the SEC could arrive around July 12. Thus, July 15, Monday, would be the most probable day to begin trading Ether ETFs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th.

Sources familiar with the matter stated that the issuers have been already working on it. As we know, in May, the SEC approved the 19b-4 filings to list the Ether ETFs on exchanges. However, they can only go live for trading after the SEC approves the S-1 submissions.\n\nSteve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, expected the Ether ETF approval in the next couple of weeks. Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, July 2, Kurtz said:\n\n\u201cThis is window-dressing, the SEC is engaged. We\u2019ve been doing this for months now. We did it for the Bitcoin ETF, the products are substantially similar \u2014 we know the plumbing, we know the process.\u201d\n\nNow the bigger question in everyone\u2019s mind is will the Ether ETF prove to be a strong catalyst to drive the crypto market higher?\n\nAlso Read: Why Are Ethereum Institutional Products Depleting Before ETF Launch?\n\nEthereum to Outperform Bitcoin\n\nOn Tuesday, K33 Research published a report stating that Ethereum would be outperforming Bitcoin post the ETF approval. As per K33, the launch of Ether ETfs would absorb nearly 0.75% to 1% of all ETH in circulation within the initial five months. This expectation is in line with that of Gemini which predicted $5 billion inflows within the first six months of launch. K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said:\n\n\u201cETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\u201d\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio steadily declined from 0.056 after the Bitcoin ETFs launched, reaching 0.046 by May 24. However, unexpected news that the SEC would soon approve Ethereum ETFs boosted the ratio back up to 0.055.\n\nAlso Read: ETH/BTC Price Prediction: ETF Hype, FOMO and Ethereum Price Imminent Rally To $5,000\n\nBhushan Akolkar Bhushan is a FinTech enthusiast with a keen understanding of financial markets.

        "content": "A significant Ethereum whale is on the brink of liquidation due to the ongoing decline in ETH prices. This whale has deposited 12,374 ETH to Compound and borrowed $31.4 million in stablecoins. If Ethereum\u2019s price drops to $2,984, the whale\u2019s long positions will be liquidated.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is trading at $3,124, down from the $3,500 zone earlier this week. This 10.42% decline since Monday has intensified concerns about the whale\u2019s potential liquidation. The situation worsened today with a 3.03% drop, followed by a marginal rise and another 3.09% decline.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin Prices Drop Sharply\n\nThe crypto market is seeing significant activity among large holders amid this price downturn. Another whale recently acquired 9,425 ETH worth over $30 million from Binance. This fresh wallet also purchased a variety of other cryptocurrencies, totaling $120 million in altcoins.\n\nAs the market declines, the whale who is long $ETH is on the verge of liquidation! He deposited 12,734 $ETH($40M) to #Compound and borrowed $31.4M stablecoins, with a health rate of only 1.06. When the price of $ETH drops to $2,984, he will be liquidated. Address:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lP9877HjCJ \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 4, 2024\n\nThis large acquisition includes BNB, MATIC, LINK, AVAX, and top meme coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and Floki. The ETH purchase was the largest among these transactions. These moves are drawing attention as they occur during substantial market volatility.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price drop is closely following Bitcoin\u2019s recent decline. Bitcoin has been falling sharply since Monday, driven by sales from major players and miners. Analyst Charles Edwards noted that long-term Bitcoin holders are actively selling their BTC.\n\nGlassnode data shared by Edwards indicates a 374,000 Bitcoin negative flow. This translates to approximately $24 billion worth of Bitcoin being dumped on the market. Additionally, the U.S. and German governments have recently sold significant amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: Dogecoin Whale Bags 90M Tokens Amid Market Crash, What\u2019s Next For DOGE?\n\nETH Price Drop Could Trigger Liquidations\n\nThe potential liquidation of a giant Ethereum whale could have broader market implications. If Ethereum\u2019s price falls to the critical $2,984 level, it may trigger further sell-offs. This could exacerbate the current downtrend and lead to more liquidations.\n\nThe ongoing selling pressure from Bitcoin is also affecting the overall market sentiment. As major holders and governments offload their assets, it creates additional downward pressure. Investors are closely watching these developments to gauge the market\u2019s next moves.\n\nMarket analysts are providing varied perspectives on the situation. Some believe the whale\u2019s liquidation risk underscores the fragility of highly leveraged positions. They argue that such scenarios highlight the importance of risk management in volatile markets.\n\nOthers are focusing on the broader market dynamics at play. They point to the influence of Bitcoin\u2019s performance on Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin faces significant sell-offs, it drags down the entire market, including Ethereum.\n\nAlso Read: US Government Shifts $14M Bitcoin Amid $BTC Dip, New Selloff Incoming\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "K33 Research says that Ethereum spot ETFs will accrue up to 1% of the Ether supply, or $4 billion, pushing ETH to outperform Bitcoin, which faces selling pressure as Mt. Gox creditors get refunded.\n\nThe firm says that ETH is trading at a steep discount against BTC but noted that Ether\u2019s futures interest was soaring, indicating that traders are accruing the altcoin on high leverage.\n\nK33 Research says Ethereum spot ETFs will change the game for the largest altcoin, making it a better investment than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Norwegian analytics company, formerly Arcane Research, says that most investors don\u2019t realize Ether\u2019s vast opportunity. This is reflected in its continued suppressed price, even as the green light for the launch of the ETH ETFs edges closer.\n\nThe company believes that once the ETFs launch, they will quickly rack up around 1% of all circulating Ethereum, equating to 1.2 million ETH, or $3.86 billion. It stated:\n\nWe maintain a bullish ETH outlook in anticipation of net inflows equivalent to 0.75-1% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in the five months following the launch.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 #Ethereum (ETH) set to outshine #Bitcoin (BTC) post-ETF launch! \ud83d\udcb9 K33 Research: 'We maintain a bullish ETH outlook in anticipation of net inflows equivalent to 0.75-1% of ETH\u2019s circulating supply in the five months following the launch.' Get ready for a bullish ride! \ud83d\udcc8\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SB9fTggK9M \u2014 Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP) July 3, 2024\n\nMarket experts have yet to come to a consensus on when the SEC will nod to the ETH ETFs. As Crypto News Flash reported, some, like ETF Store President Nate Geraci and Consensys\u2019 Jimmy Ragosa, believe the approval will be in mid-July. Others believe it\u2019s towards the end of the month, while a few others believe the SEC\u2019s move to return the applications with its comments will lengthen the application process beyond July.\n\nAll analysts concur that these products will forever change Ethereum regardless of the timeline. American exchange and custodian says they will rack up $5 billion in the first six months, while K33 Research has a slightly more conservative estimate at $3.86 billion.\n\nThe firm said:\n\nETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\n\nCan ETFs Push Ethereum Beyond $5,000?\n\nBitcoin ETFs launched in mid-January, and two months later, the top coin hit its all-time high just below $74,000, dragging the entire market with it. Ethereum soared to $4000 at the time.\n\nAnalysts believe that a similar effect will take place once ETH ETFs launch. However, according to K33, ETH might \u201cstumble immediately following the launch of the ETFs\u201d from the \u201csell the news\u201d phenomenon. However, they expect it to pick up pace immediately and, by the end of the year, hit new heights.\n\nK33 says it\u2019s surprised that more traders aren\u2019t accumulating ETH in anticipation of the coming surge. Year-to-date, the top altcoin has only gained 45%, around the same as BTC and lower than BNB and other lower-cap altcoins.\n\nHowever, those in the derivatives market are catching on. Data shows that ETH futures open interest has been surging \u201crelentlessly\u201d as more traders take on higher leverage to buy ETH in anticipation of the price rise.\n\nEthereum trades at $3,313 at press time, dipping 3.5% in the past day.\n\nRecommended for you:"

        "content": "\u26a1 Trade Forex With High Leverage And No Limitations! \u2013 Open an Account Here\n\neth-usd\n\nEthereum, following the performance of Bitcoin, is in red on the last trading day. ETH is bearish, at least from a technical perspective, but bullish from a fundamental standpoint. This position will only change if there is a convincing close above local resistance levels, the first being $3,700. Gains of June 29 and 30 were welcomed, but for this trend to evolve, there must be confirmations; this is missing at press time.\n\nPresently, Ethereum is in red, sliding nearly 15% from May highs. Though traders are upbeat and expecting gains, movements are tight in the daily chart. So far, Ethereum is down 3% in the past day and relatively stable in the last week of trading. Meanwhile, the average trading volume remains low, at just over $10.8 billion.\n\nTraders are closely watching the following trending Ethereum news:\n\nUniswap, one of the leading DeFi protocols on Ethereum, will be releasing the Uniswap extension in the coming week. More people will engage with the mainnet through this tool, driving up demand for ETH.\n\nConsenSys, the developer of MetaMask \u2014a non-custodial wallet, has been charged by the United States SEC for allegedly enabling the trading of unregistered securities. At the same time, the development company has been sued for facilitating the staking of ETH without registration.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nThough the crypto and the broader Ethereum community are watching out for the United States SEC to approve the trading of spot Ethereum ETFs, price action remains muted for now.\n\nETH/USD is under pressure, looking at price action in the daily chart.\n\nAccordingly, traders may choose to short on every high below $3,700, targeting $3,300 in the short term.\n\nEven so, in light of the spot Ethereum ETF expectations, long-term traders might choose to buy and HODL. This preview is valid as long as prices trend above $3,300.\n\nAny decisive close below this level will invalidate the general bullish preview, permitting ETH sellers to push, angling for $2,800.\n\nThis position will be valid, especially if the bear breakout bar below June lows is with rising trading volume."

        "content": "Activities related to NFT trading and staking ensured the rise in dApp activity.\n\nWhile new demand for ETH fell, withdrawals from exchanges jumped.\n\nEthereum [ETH] stood out from the many blockchains available after its dApp volume increased by 92.43% in the last seven days. For context, dApp stands for decentralized Applications.\n\nThey are applications that operate on a blockchain network while using smart contracts to power trading and user interaction. In most cases, low transaction fees bring about a surge in volume.\n\nEthereum beats BNB Chain, others to the spot\n\nThis is because users do not have to pay exorbitant fees to facilitate the exchange of tokens or transfers. However, during Ethereum\u2019s era of high transactions fees, there were time it outperformed other chains in this regard.\n\nBut this time, the dominance could be linked to the cheap gas fees enabled by the Dencun upgrade which took place in March. At press time, Ethereum\u2019s dApp volume was $71.13 billion.\n\nThis value was much higher than BNB Chain, Polygon [MATIC], and the Tron [TRX]. However, one thing AMBCrypto noticed was that it was not an all-round increase with the applications.\n\nFor example, dApps like Blur, EigenLayer and Uniswap [UNI] NFT Aggregator registered notable hikes. However, others including Uniswap V2 and V3 could not match up as they noted declines.\n\nThis data suggested that there was a lot of NFT trading and staking that impacted the rise in volume. But trading of tokens on the blockchain were nowhere near those heights.\n\nTherefore, it was not surprising that there was a notable decrease in the network\u2019s UAW. This is an acronym for Unique Active Wallet. It is a term used to measure user engagement and activity.\n\nIf it increases, it means that user activity is high. But a decrease suggests a fall in active transactions, and that was the case with Ethereum.\n\nETH caught in between two sides\n\nMeanwhile, ETH\u2019s price changed hands at $3,365 which was a 2.32% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs it stands, the price of ETH might continue to experience a decrease or trade sideways despite optimism that the token would perform well this month.\n\nOne reason for this prediction is Ethereum\u2019s Network Growth. According to AMBCrypto\u2019s analysis, the blockchain\u2019s Network Growth was down to 23,300.\n\nThis metric measures the number of new addresses making their first successful transaction.\n\nIf the number increases, then the blockchain is getting good traction. However, a decrease implies that adoption is low, which seems to be the case with ETH.\n\nHistorically, when Network Growth rises, it does not take long for ETH\u2019s price to jump. The opposite happens when the number of new addresses fall.\n\nAs mentioned before, it is possible to sell ETH drop from $3,300 in the short term.\n\nDespite the bearish outlook in the short term, the long-term looks promising for ETH. This was because of the Exchange Net Position Change on Ethereum.\n\nThis metric tracks the 30-day supply of cryptocurrencies held in exchange wallets.\n\nWhen it increases, it means deposits on exchanges are rising, increasing the likelihood of sell-offs. However, a decrease means withdrawals, and tilts toward fewer selling pressure.\n\nRead Ethereum\u2019s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ETH holders have been removing their assets from exchanges for some months. If this continues, it could provide stability for ETH\u2019s price.\n\nSo, ETH could target hitting $4,000 this quarter or surpassing its all-time high."

Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and XRP have led the crypto scam losses amounting more than $1.5 billion. This year, over 200 significant incidents have resulted in approximately $1.56 billion in losses.\n\nCrypto Scam Losses Hit $1.5B\n\nAccording to Peck Shield Alert data, only $319 million of lost crypto funds have been recovered. Moreover, the losses this year represent a staggering 293% increase compared to the same period in 2023, where losses amounted to $480 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFurthermore, DeFi protocols have been the primary targets for hackers. They account for 59% of the total stolen value. Over 20 public chains experienced major hacks during this period. Moreover, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP topped the list for the amount lost via crypto hacks.\n\nIn addition, Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most frequently targeted, each accounting for 31.3% of the total hacks. Meanwhile, Arbitrum followed with 12.5% of the attacks. One of the most significant incidents occurred on June 3, 2024.\n\nDMM Bitcoin, a major Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, reported a substantial breach. The attackers stole 4,502.9 BTC, worth over $300 million at the time. This incident highlighted vulnerabilities within exchanges, especially those handling large volumes of digital assets.\n\nAlso Read: XRP News: Whale Shifts 63M Coins As Ripple Strengthens Case\n\nMajor XRP, ETH, BTC Hacks\n\nA week after the DMM Bitcoin attack, on June 10, UwU Lend, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, was compromised. The breach led to a loss of approximately $19.3 million in digital assets. This hack underscores the ongoing risks associated with DeFi platforms, which often operate with less regulatory oversight. The platform then offered $5 million reward for catching the hacker.\n\nEarlier in the year, on February 3, 2024, Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, confirmed a major security breach involving his personal wallets. Initially, there were rumors that Ripple itself was targeted. However, Larsen clarified that the hack involved his digital wallets and not Ripple\u2019s corporate assets.\n\nThe hackers managed to transfer a whopping 213 million XRP tokens, valued at approximately$112.5 million. Moreover, on-chain detective ZachXBT first alerted the community to the suspicious transactions. In response to the theft, Larsen and various crypto exchanges took swift action to mitigate the impact.\n\nMultiple exchanges, including MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, and HitBTC, collaborated to freeze a significant portion of the stolen funds. Binance alone froze $4.2 million worth of XRP to aid the investigation.\n\nMoreover, on April 2, 2024, FixedFloat, a Bitcoin Lightning-based exchange, experienced a security breach. Unauthorized transactions led to financial losses exceeding $3 million. This incident highlighted recurring security issues for FixedFloat, following a similar breach earlier in the year.\n\nThe company also faced significant challenges in securing its platform against repeated attacks. Moreover, in February, hackers stole $26 million worth of Ethereum and Bitcoin from FixedFloat. These digital assets were then dumped to exchanges to realize profits.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Leads Bitcoin By 2x In Network Fee Revenue, Thanks to Layer-2s\n\nKritika Mehta Kritika boasts over 2 years of experience in the financial news sector.

Analysts predict that these ETFs could begin listing within the next two weeks.\n\nBitwise Submits Amended S-1 for Ethereum ETF\n\nBitwise\u2019s updated registration form was submitted on Wednesday. Analysts suggest that these products be listed by mid-July. A source close to the situation indicated the SEC might approve the final drafts by the end of next week.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe SEC approved 19b-4 forms for eight spot Ethereum ETFs, including Bitwise, on May 23. However, issuers need their S-1 statements to become effective before trading can begin. This two-step process has kept the market eagerly awaiting the launch.\n\nDespite the light comments on the S-1 forms, the SEC has taken its time to get approvals. A single problematic issuer may need to be on time to process. Nevertheless, expectations remain high for a launch this month.\n\nAlso Read: Federal Reserve Forecasts \u201cAI Will Be Deflationary\u201d To Boost Economy\n\nAnalysts Confident in Near-Term ETF Launch\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted the frequent amendments in S-1 forms. He expects more filings from other issuers throughout the week. This pattern suggests a coordinated effort to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nUPDATE: We've got another amended S-1 from @BitwiseInvest for their #Ethereum ETF. Expect more from other issuers throughout the rest of the week. We're thinking these things could potentially list later next week or the week of the 15th at this point. pic.twitter.com/xqVlt9lSGy \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 3, 2024\n\nSenior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expressed surprise at the SEC\u2019s slow pace. He speculated on possible reasons, including summertime vacations. Despite this, he confirmed indications of a launch this month.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s return of S-1 forms with light comments suggests minimal hurdles remain. Analysts view this as the final round of feedback. This has increased confidence in a near-term launch.\n\nBitwise made significant updates to its S-1 form. One notable change includes waiving the sponsor fee for the first $500 million assets. However, the firm still needs to disclose the fee after this threshold.\n\nAnother issuer, VanEck, also announced that fees would be waived initially. These moves suggest competitive strategies to attract initial investors. By waiving fees, these firms aim to lower the entry barriers for new investors.\n\nThe recent amendments highlight Bitwise\u2019s proactive approach to regulatory compliance. The firm\u2019s updates reflect a strategic positioning ahead of the anticipated market entry. This aligns with the broader trend among issuers to streamline their offerings.\n\nAlso Read: US Lawmaker French Hill Doubles Down On Trump\u2019s Pro-Crypto Stance\n\nMaxwell Mutuma Maxwell is a crypto-economic analyst and Blockchain enthusiast, passionate about helping people understand the potential of decentralized technology.

        "content": "Short-term Analysis\n\nIn the short term, Ethereum price movement suggests a cautious outlook. The 1.71% decrease in the last 24 hours, coupled with a bearish MACD and a nearing oversold RSI, indicates that sellers currently dominate the market. However, the approach towards the first support level at US$3,347.7 could attract buyers, potentially stabilizing the price and providing a platform for recovery.\n\nMedium-term Analysis\n\nOver the medium term, the 1.05% decline over the past week reflects ongoing bearish sentiment. The support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining the next phase of price movement. If Ethereum holds above the first support level and manages to breach the first resistance level, it could signal a shift in momentum toward a more bullish outlook.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nThe overall market sentiment for Ethereum remains mixed. While the current technical indicators point to a bearish trend, the approaching support levels and near-oversold RSI suggest the potential for a rebound. Traders and investors should closely monitor these key levels and technical indicators to make informed decisions."

        "content": "Lido outperformed Ethereum in terms of fees earned in the last few days.\n\nDespite interest in staking growing, the price of ETH declined.\n\nLido [LDO] has managed to outperform Ethereum [ETH] in the last few days in terms of fees earned.\n\nLido showed growth\n\nIn the last month, Lido Finance collected $20.8 million in fees in just one week, which was higher than the fees collected by Ethereum itself, which collected $19.8 million during the same period.\n\nThis impressive performance placed Lido Finance as the second-highest fee earner within the cryptocurrency space for that week, behind only Tron [TRX], which had earned $33.7 million.\n\nLido Finance\u2019s momentum continued throughout the month. Over the entire month, Lido generated $98 million in fees, representing an 8% increase compared to the previous month.\n\nThis strong fee generation is likely due to Lido\u2019s dominance in the staked ETH market. At press time, Lido held over $33.4 billion in total staked assets, commanding a 29% market share in staked ETH.\n\nLido\u2019s total value locked (TVL) jumped 1.36% this week, reaching $33.48 billion. This surge was driven by a wave of new ETH staking deposits, with 95,616 net new ETH staked through Lido in the past seven days.\n\nWhile the 7-day stETH APR dipped slightly by 0.04% to 2.96%, there were positive signs elsewhere.\n\nWrapped stETH (wstETH) bridged to Layer 2 networks saw a significant rise of 7.19%, bringing the total to 141,586 wstETH.\n\nArbitrum [ARB] held the majority with 65,290 wstETH, followed by Optimism [OP] at 27,879 wstETH. Both networks experienced minor declines in the past week.\n\nThere was also a slight increase in wstETH deposited in lending pools and liquidity pools, reaching 2.70 million stETH and 83.5k stETH respectively.\n\nwstETH bridged to Cosmos networks also saw a small uptick, reaching 1,788 wstETH up 2.12% in the past week.\n\nHowever, the 7-day trading volume for (w)stETH dipped 7.25% compared to the previous week, totaling $1.23 billion.\n\nWhile Scroll saw a significant increase in wstETH up 86.26%, other networks like Base, Polygon, Linea, and zkSync Era experienced minor declines.\n\nWhat happens next for ETH?\n\nThe popularity and growth of the Lido protocol hints at the fact that users are increasingly showing their interest in staking ETH.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s LDO\u2019s market cap in BTC\u2019s terms\n\nEven though ETH\u2019s price may be stagnating at the time of writing, a surge in staking implies that existing users believe in the long-term potential of ETH.\n\nAt press time, ETH was trading at $3,336.23 and its price had declined by 3.15% in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "As the global financial markets prepare to launch U.S.-based spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Ethereum is positioned to potentially outperform Bitcoin, according to a new analysis by K33 Research.\n\nThis comes amid concerns that Bitcoin might face downward pressure due to upcoming repayments to creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox exchange.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nETF Launch to Begin a New Era for Ethereum\n\nEthereum has lagged behind Bitcoin in performance over the last year, with the former surging 67% while the latter by 95%, but that might be about to change with the anticipated launch of Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, expected in the coming weeks.\n\nAnalysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman from K33 Research suggest that introducing these spot ETFs could be pivotal for Ethereum\u2019s valuation.\n\nDespite a likely initial dip post-launch, they forecast that inflows into these funds will propel Ethereum\u2019s price over time, drawing a parallel to the earlier impact of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETFs, which attracted billions of dollars in inflow after launch.\n\nThis optimism is rooted in the belief that ETFs will catalyze significant capital flows into Ethereum, mirroring the influx seen with Bitcoin.\n\nThe analysts project net inflows amounting to 0.75% to 1% of Ethereum\u2019s circulating supply within five months post-launch, potentially setting the stage for substantial price appreciation. The analysts noted:\n\nETFs are a solid catalyst for relative ETH strength as the summer progresses and flows accumulate, and I firmly view current ETH/BTC prices as a bargain for the patient trader.\n\nWhen Will ETH Spot ETF Launch In The US?\n\nDespite the analysts\u2019 bullish outlook, the market appears skeptical, as evidenced by Ethereum futures trading at a discount relative to Bitcoin futures, as highlighted in the K33 Research.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nExperts Eye Spot Ethereum ETF Launch By Mid-July, Predict Price Rally 2 months ago\n\nEthereum is trading at around $3,312, reflecting a 3.3% drop over the past day and conceding with the ubiquitous decline in the crypto market.\n\nIn the broader context, the crypto industry is enthusiastic about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, highlighted that amended S-1 forms for Bitcoin ETFs are due before July 8, with approvals potentially finalized by July 12, paving the way for a mid-July launch.\n\nWen spot eth ETF?

        "content": "The crypto market is currently navigating through a turbulent phase, particularly for Ethereum, which has seen a significant downturn of nearly 15% in its value over the past week.\n\nAmid this negative price performance, Peter Schiff, a well-known economist and a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, has chosen to add salt to the wounds by projecting a stark prediction for ETH. According to Schiff, Ethereum could plummet to as low as $1,500, marking a substantial decline from its current levels.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nShiff\u2019s Bearish Outlook And Community Reaction\n\nSchiff\u2019s prediction comes when Ethereum is trading below the previous crucial support of $3,000 mark, a sharp 30% fall from its peak above $4,500 in March.\n\nThis decline coincides with heightened speculation surrounding the potential launch of an Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), which seems to have triggered a premature sell-off among investors instead of propelling the price.\n\nSchiff\u2019s commentary suggests that the market\u2019s response to the ETF rumors has been to liquidate positions rather than hold, adding further downward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price.\n\nHe expressed his view on Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform, X, stating, \u201cIt looks like those buying the Ethereum ETF rumors couldn\u2019t wait for the fact to sell,\u201d indicating a market driven by speculation rather than sustained investment confidence.\n\nWhile Schiff\u2019s bearish outlook has garnered attention, it has also sparked a mix of skepticism and agreement within the crypto community. Users have expressed varying opinions on social media platforms, with some questioning the technical basis of Schiff\u2019s $1,500 target.\n\nOthers humorously noted that Schiff\u2019s pessimistic predictions often come at market bottoms, suggesting his views might inadvertently signal a buying opportunity. For instance, one user remarked on the irony of Schiff\u2019s timing, indicating that his bearish predictions could contradict market sentiment indicators.\n\nthx for your inputs you do realize you only become relevant on this side of twitter as a bottom signal lol youre like those acoustic wif kids who had a stroke on stage the wif party as a top signal \u2014 agent pretzel (@agent_pretzel) July 5, 2024\n\nEthereum Faces Critical Juncture\n\nEthereum is experiencing a significant downturn, trading at $2,975\u2014a 4.2% drop over the past day. This decline and Bitcoin\u2019s similar trajectory have led to a 4.1% reduction in the global cryptocurrency market cap, erasing more than $200 billion in value.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, this downturn has triggered substantial losses for traders, with 207,020 liquidations in the past day, totaling $576.53 million. Ethereum-related liquidations account for $134.58 million, predominantly from long positions.\n\nWhile Peter Schiff\u2019s outlook may seem too pessimistic amid these market conditions, another voice in the crypto analysis sphere, Inspo Crypto, offers a slightly more moderate view.\n\nHe notes that Ethereum\u2019s price has fallen to early May levels and suggests that the next 8-hour trading window could be crucial in determining the market\u2019s direction.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAnalyst Predicts Ethereum Nosedive, Cautions Investors To Prepare For $2,700 Target 2 months ago\n\nIf Ethereum can rise above these levels, it might potentially ease the bearish trend. However, failure to reach the $3,170 mark (which it already has) could lead to further declines, possibly down to $2,700, exacerbating losses across the altcoin market.\n\n$ETH has broken down below $3,170. The next 8 hours (1D candle) will show whether the bulls have given up or not. If the price retraces back above, we should consider this a deviation. But if $ETH instead retests the lower trend channel next at $3,170 unsuccessfully, it could\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1msfKQBf2v \u2014 InspoCrypto (@InspoCrypto) July 4, 2024\n\nFeatured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"

        "title": "Experts Eye Spot Ethereum ETF Launch By Mid-July, Predict Price Rally - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The crypto industry is on the verge of a potentially significant development as key figures in the sector hint at the imminent approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the United States, possibly triggering a notable price rally for ETH.\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared insights into the expected timeline for the launch of the first spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAccording to Geraci, current forecasts by Bloomberg predict a mid-July launch. He detailed the procedural timeline via X, stating, \u201cWen spot eth ETF? BBG sticking w/ mid-July. Amended S-1s due July 8th. Potential final S-1s by July 12th. Would theoretically mean launch week of July 15th.\u201d\n\nIn parallel, Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, confirmed to Bloomberg on July 2 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might greenlight a spot Ethereum ETF before the month\u2019s end.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nETH Price Dips As Ethereum ETF Approval Faces Delay 2 months ago\n\nKurz emphasized the extensive groundwork laid in collaboration with the SEC, drawing parallels between the proposed Ethereum ETF and Galaxy\u2019s existing spot Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), created with Invesco. Kurz expressed confidence in their preparedness, remarking, \u201cWe know the plumbing, we know the process\u2026 The SEC is engaged.\u201d\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also chimed in, aligning with the mid-July expectations. He highlighted the SEC\u2019s recent instructions to Ethereum ETF issuers for amending their S-1 registration forms by July 8, suggesting possible further amendments. Notably, the SEC approved rule changes under 19-b4 in May, facilitating the listing and trading of such funds, though the issuance of funds remained pending final approvals.\n\nEthereum Price Holds Above Key Support\n\nThe anticipation of these approvals appears to be having a stabilizing effect on Ethereum prices. Crypto analyst IncomeSharks, commenting on Ethereum\u2019s current price trajectory via X, noted optimism for a near-term breakout, stating, \u201cETH \u2013 Looking more optimistic for a Q3 breakout. Liking the chances of a run towards $4,000 this or next month.\u201d According to the chart shared by him, ETH price needs to hold the region of $3,300 to $3,350 in order to rally to $4,000.\n\nSupporting this sentiment, Cold Blooded Shiller highlighted the crucial need for Ethereum to demonstrate momentum at the current price levels, specifically around the $3,400 mark, as a key indicator for a potential high-time-frame impulse.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Suffers 3rd Straight Weekly Outflows, Becomes 2024\u2019s Worst Performer 2 months ago\n\n\u201cETH is still in a fine position but it really needs to start showing some momentum soon. LTF divergences around this $3400 low are probably where I take one stab at trying to capture any HTF impulse away from the consolidation,\u201d he remarked via X.\n\nAdding historical perspective, analyst Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) compared the current market phase to Ethereum\u2019s long consolidation in 2016-2017 before its massive rally, urging persistence and optimism: \u201cIn 2016-2017, ETH consolidated for 50+ weeks before rallying nearly 12000 percent. Today, people are giving up after less than 20 weeks, with ETH ETFs right around the corner. Stick to the plan boys. The best is yet to come.\u201d\n\nAt press time, ETH traded at $3,353.\n\nFeatured image created with DALL\u00b7E, chart from TradingView.com"
