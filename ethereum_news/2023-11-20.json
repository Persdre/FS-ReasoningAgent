        "content": "On-chain fees for Bitcoin transactions have surpassed those on Ethereum for the first time in three years.\n\nOptimism surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the rising popularity of Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions has led to a rise in transaction fees on the network, which surpassed fees on Ethereum for the first time since 2020.\n\nAccording to data from Crypto Fees, Bitcoin transaction fees reached a daily high of $11.6 million, outpacing the $5.6 million in daily transaction fees recorded by Ethereum over the same period.\n\nHowever, on a weekly basis Ethereum transaction fees stands at around $8.3 million, while Bitcoin averaged $7 million in fees.\n\nRead more: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Calls Bitcoin an \u2018International Asset\u2019 that Could \u2018Revolutionize Finance\u2019\n\nStill, the shift in daily metrics potentially implies a change in current market dynamics, especially when taking into account the factor at which Bitcoin fees have risen over the last few weeks.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Bitcoin generated $11M in transaction fees. That is twice what Ethereum did, and up 20X from the amount it was generating two weeks ago. All it took was a little magic from the @TaprootWizards pic.twitter.com/zp6OOh0gUB \u2014 Mippo \ud83d\udfea (@MikeIppolito_) November 19, 2023\n\n\u201cIt gets even better when you look under the hood. Transaction fees (which need to grow for the network to be sustainable) are now 25% of miner revenue. That\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been in a long, long time,\u201d said Michael Ippolito, co-founder of Blockworks, on X.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Is Finishing Out 2023 as More Valuable Than the Rest of the Entire Crypto Ecosystem\n\nWhile some market participants attribute the surge in Bitcoin network activity to the price action surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval on the horizon, others, including Ippolito, believe that a renewed interest in ordinal inscriptions was responsible for most of the activity.\n\nBREAKING: Ordinals inscriptions made up 57% of Bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours driving up fees to a 5 month high of 205 sat/vB. Ordinals are the #1 use case on Bitcoin right now. pic.twitter.com/lVvNZIG2uV \u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) November 9, 2023\n\nCongested mempools and high levels of transaction fees are usually a deterrent to user growth, but surprisingly, on-chain data shows that this hasn\u2019t been the case this time around.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows that the Bitcoin adoption rate reached a yearly high of 67.62% last week."

        "content": "Cloudflare is a content-neutral Internet infrastructure service. The company aims not to interfere with the traffic of its clients and users but, in some cases, it has to take action. This means responding to DMCA subpoenas and takedown requests for hosted content, for example. In addition, Cloudflare now reports it has blocked access to 'abusive' content on its Ethereum gateway.\n\nOne of Cloudflare\u2019s main aims is to make the Internet more secure while respecting the privacy of its users.\n\nThis laudable goal is broadly respected but in common with other internet services, abuse of Cloudflare\u2019s services can lead to conflicting situations.\n\nThe California-based company previously terminated service to controversial sites including the Daily Stormer and Kiwi Farms. These actions were taken voluntarily, with Cloudflare citing an immediate threat to human life as the reason for the Kiwi Farms intervention.\n\nDomain Blocking\n\nIn addition to these rare events, the Internet infrastructure company is also subject to court orders from around the globe. In some cases, these orders require the company to block access to piracy-related domain names.\n\nCloudflare mentions these blocking orders in its latest transparency report which covers the second half of 2022. The report doesn\u2019t mention the number of court orders or blocked domains, but it confirms that Cloudflare complies with legitimate legal rulings.\n\n\u201cIf we determine that the order is valid and requires Cloudflare action, we may limit blocking of access to the content to those areas where it violates local law, a practice known as \u2018geo-blocking\u2019,\u201d Cloudflare writes.\n\nDNS Blocking\n\nDNS blocking orders apply locally and shouldn\u2019t affect people in other countries. However, things got more complicated recently when an Italian court required Cloudflare to restrict access to three torrent sites through its public DNS resolver 1.1.1.1.\n\nCloudflare fiercely objected to the order but ultimately lost the legal battle. That left the company with no other option than to take action. But, instead of blocking content through its global DNS resolver, it geo-blocked the domains for Italians.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that those websites used Cloudflare services, Cloudflare took steps following the issuance of the order to disable access to those websites for users in Italy or from Cloudflare equipment in Italy.\n\n\u201cCloudflare took action to geoblock all three domains that were addressed by the court\u2019s order and were using our service at the time the orders were issued via Cloudflare\u2019s pass-through CDN and security services,\u201d the company added.\n\nIPFS and Ethereum Restrictions\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Cloudflare further notes that it has implemented access restrictions on its public Ethereum gateway. The company doesn\u2019t store any content on the Ethereum network, nor can it remove any. However, it can block access through its service.\n\nIf Cloudflare receives valid abuse reports or copyright infringement complaints, it will take appropriate action. The same applies to the gateway for the decentralized IPFS network.\n\nIn its previous transparency report, Cloudflare already mentioned more than 1,000 IPFS actions a figure that increased slightly in the second half of last year. At the same time, Cloudflare also restricted access to 99 \u2018items\u2019 on the Ethereum network.\n\nSince these are \u2018gateway\u2019 related restrictions there\u2019s no impact on the content hosted on IPFS or Ethereum. Instead, it will only make it impossible to access content through Cloudflare\u2019s service.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many of these restrictions are abuse or copyright-related, as not much context is provided. The Ethereum actions are, at least in part, a response to the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s sanctions against the cryptocurrency tumbler Tornado Cash.\n\n\u201cThose sanctions raise significant legal questions about the extent to which particular computer software, rather than individuals or entities that use that software, can be subject to sanctions,\u201d Cloudflare writes.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, to comply with legal requirements, Cloudflare has taken steps to disable access through the Cloudflare-operated Ethereum Gateway to the digital currency addresses identified in the designation.\u201d\n\nDMCA Notices and Subpoenas\n\nThere are more obvious copyright responses as well. While Cloudflare generally doesn\u2019t block content in response to DMCA notices for customers that use its CDN services, it does remove infringing content permanently hosted on its servers.\n\nThese hosting services have expanded over the years and the same is true for the volume of valid DMCA notices received, up from 18 to 972 in the span of a year, as shown below. That\u2019s still a fairly modest number for a company with millions of customers.\n\nFinally, Cloudflare reports that the number of civil subpoenas, including those issued under the DMCA, has decreased. Rightsholders including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) typically use these requests to obtain identifying information about Cloudflare customers.\n\nIn the second half of last year, the company received 20 civil subpoenas which targeted 57 domain names. That\u2019s the lowest number since Cloudflare first disclosed this statistic five years ago, signaling a downward trend.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of Cloudflare\u2019s latest Transparency Report is available here (pdf)"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market wraps up a dynamic week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum holding steady after a significant drop in inflation. Despite the resilience of the market leaders, the spotlight was on altcoins, particularly Kaspa (KSP), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR), showcasing notable gains and hinting at potential growth in the near future.\n\nAltcoins Take Center Stage\n\nKaspa (KSP) emerged as the week\u2019s star performer, experiencing an impressive 64% surge, reaching a peak of $0.1519. As of the latest data, KSP is trading at $0.1379, maintaining robust performance despite a slight 2.80% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nRender (RNDR) followed closely behind, boasting a 50% gain over the week. Currently trading at $3.58, RNDR displays a marginal 3.46% increase in price, accompanied by a 42.49% decrease in trading volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nNEAR Protocol (NEAR) captured attention with a weekly increase exceeding 30%, now trading at $2.18. NEAR\u2019s impressive performance includes a 20% price increase and an 88.84% surge in trading volume within the last 24 hours.\n\nOther notable altcoins, including Avalanche (AVAX), Immutable (IMX), and Mantle (MNT), also reported gains in their weekly charts. AVAX showed a 24% increase, IMX rose by 22%, and MNT exhibited a 10% uptick, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum Weekly Review\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum remained stable after a notable drop in inflation from a 40-year high last June, currently standing at 3.2%, slightly above the Fed\u2019s target, according to the CPI report. Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase, trading just below its annual peak at approximately $38,000 earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge marks its most robust four-week performance since January, witnessing a remarkable 42% increase from just under $17,000 to nearly $24,000. Bitcoin\u2019s price dominance has returned, albeit temporarily, with the potential for quick rebounds if market sentiment shifts.\n\nSantiment\u2019s analysis revealed fluctuations in Bitcoin wallets during the recent surge. Numerous new smaller wallets with less than 1 BTC flooded the network, while the 1-100 tier flattened out, and the 100+ tier may be experiencing profit-taking.\n\n\ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc2c\ud83d\udc33 #Bitcoin's wallets have fluctuated during this major market-wide surge. Tons of new smaller wallets with less than 1 $BTC have flooded the network.

IntoTheBlock reported a yearly high in the new adoption rate of Bitcoin, reaching 67.62%, indicating a surge in new market participants.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Bitcoin's NVT (Network Value to Transaction) ratio has improved significantly, one of @santimentfeed's primary alpha #crypto market signals for traders.

Santiment highlighted Ethereum\u2019s 38% market value surge in the past four weeks, driven by high network growth and an increase in addresses across different tiers.\n\nAs of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $37,159.19, showing a 1.23% increase over the past seven days and a 2.36% increase in the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,023.05, displaying a 0.70% decrease in the past 24 hours and a 4.58% gain over the past seven days.\n\nRelated Reading | Bucking Bearish Trends: Bitcoin\u2019s Unconventional Moonlit Path To A Resilient Bull Cycle"

        "content": "Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson sought to clear the air after new evidence emerged about his past involvement with the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nCardano\u2019s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has often been haunted by the experience he had in his early days in the blockchain ecosystem, especially while working on Ethereum.\n\nIn the latest development, the Cardano founder was compelled to speak in a 22-minute livestream in which he dispelled the rumors and provided clarity to listeners.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the heart of the current matter was a video and documentation shared by Steven Nerayoff. Nerayoff was an early Ethereum advisor who had access to essential communication within the team. In the documentation being sold as an NFT, Nerayoff shared previously private information on a troubling period in Ethereum\u2019s history.\n\nAt the time, the Ethereum team wanted to restructure the project and called on Nerayoff for advice, leading to a lengthy call between the advisor and Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. With or without Vitalik\u2019s permission, Nerayoff recorded the call, which he now wants to monetize as an NFT.\n\nETHEREUM RESCUE & RESTRUCTURE PLAN:\n\nIn late 2014 Ethereum was in trouble. Vitalik Buterin asked Steven Nerayoff to do a full diagnostic assessment and recommendations on how to save Ethereum and restructure it for long term success. Over the early months of 2015 Steven and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/o7H0dwMhiy \u2014 Steven Nerayoff (@StevenNerayoff) November 16, 2023\n\nNotably, Charles Hoskinson was among the major subjects of the call. A transcript of the call shows that Charles was mentioned 69 times, with Nerayoff speaking favorably of the entrepreneur\u2019s involvement with Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNew Evidence Clarifies Charles Hoskinson\u2019s Reputation with Ethereum\n\nSteven Nerayoff\u2019s latest reveal suggests that Charles Hoskinson was a valuable member of the Ethereum Foundation. During the conversation with Vitalik Buterin, Nerayoff spoke highly favorably of Charles Hoskinson and urged the team to bring him back into the ranks, given his experience and strengths.\n\nReviewing this part of the conversation, Charles Hoskinson said in the recent livestream, \u201cHe [Nerayoff] was trying really hard to bring me back into the fold. At this juncture, I was already deep in the thick of things, starting Input Output [Cardano\u2019s engineering arm].\u201d\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Nerayoff\u2019s documentation and call with Vitalik dispel three main accusations that were leveled against him by naysayers. The allegations include that \u2018Charles is a pathological liar, never contributed to the crypto space, and constantly overstated his role in Ethereum\u2019s early development.\u2019\n\nThe Cardano founder, alluding to recent reports by crypto journalist Laura Shin, added that half-baked stories have helped foster those lies. However, such lies hold no water compared to Nerayoff\u2019s independently released information.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoskinson reiterated his long-term commitment to building out Cardano and his reputation in the crypto space. He noted that he has been in cryptocurrency for over 10 years and has had no \u201cclass action lawsuit, legal issues.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the entrepreneur has sustained an impressive track record, having \u2018built a $12 billion dollar valued blockchain, collaborated on over 200 academic research papers, and written a lot of code.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with the economic value of these things. [Yet] You can\u2019t disagree with the fact that I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve been building things,\u201d Charles Hoskinson added.\n\nNotably, Cardano (ADA) has consistently ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in recent years. At the same time, the blockchain has seen increased DeFi TVL in the past few months, underlining its continued growth."

        "title": "A spicy salvo launched in the monolithic vs modular debate - Blockworks",
        "content": "As blockchains scale, the cost of transactions and blockspace falls. The 2022-2023 bear market has been characterized by a continuous build out of infrastructure, to lay the groundwork for future growth.\n\nYet arguments about the best way to scale abound, they often fall into one of two camps.\n\nOne is \u201cmodular,\u201d with its standard-bearers Ethereum and Cosmos. The other is \u201cmonolithic\u201d which has come to be dominated in the crypto zeitgeist by Solana \u2014 although they prefer the term \u201cintegrated.\u201d\n\nAn essay published Friday by pseudonymous Ethereum advocate Polynya critiquing monolithic blockchains, while not mentioning it by name, has been interpreted by many as a veiled critique of Solana.\n\nThe critique comes against a backdrop of swelling interest in the network spurred by a significant price surge in Solana\u2019s native crypto asset (SOL), which is up 140% in the past month with a market cap approaching $25 billion\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile often praised for its high transaction speed and low fees, Solana has faced criticism in the past for network instability, including outright outages, and high hardware requirements to operate validating nodes\u200b\u200b.\n\nResponding to perceived shortcomings, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, has acknowledged some network flaws, but contends the Solana community has worked diligently to mitigate them.\n\nYakovenko views these challenges as part of the network\u2019s growth, likening them to historical issues faced by other major networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nPlans include the mid-2024 launch of Firedancer, the first independent validator client software for Solana (Ethereum has 5), which is expected to increase throughput to as much as a million transactions per second (TPS) in the future.\n\nYakovenko, responding to Polynya\u2019s specific critique, argued the natural growth in computing power coupled with falling costs as hardware becomes commoditized will handle Solana\u2019s needs with aplomb.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya\u2019s essay also advocates for advanced technologies like validity proofs and data availability sampling to address scaling demands, predicting \u201cevery single monolithic blockchain seeking scale will upgrade to tech like validity proofs and data availability sampling or be risk [obsolescence].\u201d\n\nSolana developer Mert Mumtaz, CEO at Helius and co-host of Blockworks\u2019 Lightspeed podcast, responded that Solana could embrace both vertical and horizontal scaling.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya further lamented the crypto industry\u2019s disproportionate focus on infrastructure over user onboarding \u2014 and a dearth of applications with product-market fit \u2014 which Mumtaz derided as the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn response to criticism, Polynya published an addendum post on Sunday in which they acknowledge the tone of the original essay was a bit harsh, but noted \u201ccontent only gets attention in crypto if it\u2019s provocative.\u201d\n\nMonolithic chains that integrate modular components, such as validity proofs and data availability sampling, would be a welcome change, Polynya argues, suggesting they would no longer be \u201cmonolithic\u201d because \u201cper my definition you no longer need all nodes to na\u00efvely reprocess all transactions to verify integrity.\u201d\n\nEndgame\n\nUltimately, this dispute revolves around the question of what is the modus operandi of using a blockchain?\n\n\u201cThe whole point of a public blockchain is lost if you are not resistant for the worst-case scenarios,\u201d Polynya wrote. \u201c[10,000 nodes] is not enough, and we should strive to have 100,000 nodes in different types of places across the world. We need nodes at homes, schools, government offices \u2014 in large cities, in villages, in Chile, in Papua New Guinea, and eventually in space.\u201d\n\nSolana currently has between 2,000 and 3,000 nodes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine to have a monolithic blockchain today, the technology to push past its crippling limitations did not exist 5 years ago,\u201d Polynya concludes, with the caveat that the industry will \u201cinevitably converge\u201d on a design using validity proofs and data availability sampling.\n\n\u201cThis is the only currently known way for the blockchain world to achieve our endgame of global scale, all verified on our mobile phones.\u201d\n\nPolynya further warns against continued \u201cPonzifying\u201d of dapps. \u201cAs an industry, collectively, we must invest in consolidating our existing applications which have product-market fit, before traditional incumbents catch up and take away market share,\u201d they said in Sunday\u2019s denouement.\n\nUpdated, Nov. 20, 2023 at 9:52 am ET, with additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

        "content": "Crypto trading volumes soar, BlackRock files to launch spot Ethereum ETF, while Tether goes Bitcoin mining\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of Bitcoin started last week with a sharp move downwards, dropping from around $37,000 to a low near $35,000, before recovering to now trade at $37,100 per coin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, moved steadily upward throughout the past week, going from around $1,940 per coin to a peak near $2,050 before a small correction over the weekend brought ether down to $2,020 a token.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price kept rising as BlackRock \u2013 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2013 filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust.\n\nThe fund would aim to \u201creflect generally the performance of the price of Ether\u201d, and would have Coinbase as the custodian for the ETH held by the fund. Ethereum\u2019s price started climbing after BlackRock registered the iShares Ethereum trust with Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations a week ago.\n\nBlackRock has filed the S-1 prospectus for its Spot Ethereum ETF with the SEC, earlier this morning.\n\nThe filing, among other things, appoints Coinbase as the Custodian for the underlying ETH.\n\n\n\nThere appears to be no mention on whether the Trust will actively be staking the ETH\u2026 \u2014 Tree News (@News_Of_Alpha) November 16, 2023\n\nWhile the spot ETH ETF filing helped the price of Ether rise, a fake XRP ETF filing sparked a trading frenzy that saw the price of the cryptocurrency rise as much as 13% throughout the week, before BlackRock denied any involvement. XRP\u2019s price then erased its gains, leading to over $7 million in liquidations.\n\nThe fake XRP ETF filing also appeared on Delaware\u2019s website, and Delaware\u2019s Department of Justice could now be looking into the fraudulent filing. It\u2019s unclear how it ended up on the website.\n\nMeanwhile the cryptocurrency arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Cboe Digital, is set to introduce margined Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts on January 11, following their their receipt of approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in June.\n\nThe move will position Cboe Digital as the first regulated U.S. platform to provide both spot and leveraged derivatives on a single platform. Margined futures enable traders to utilize leverage to trade beyond their collateral, a feature not available with regular futures.\n\nCrypto market volume soars amid South Korean trading frenzy\n\nIn the last two months, the volume of the digital asset market has experienced a significant rise, largely driven by trading activity in Asia, particularly South Korea. According to CCData, South Korean exchanges have more than doubled their market share, increasing from 5.2% in January to 12.9% in November. The total trading volume also saw growth in October and November.\n\nThe firm\u2019s recent Exchange Review report details that Upbit, a centralized exchange, witnessed a substantial increase in market share in October, accounting for 9.16% of the trading volume on these platforms.\n\nThis is the highest market share that the Korean cryptocurrency exchange has achieved since its inception, with local traders reportedly focusing on altcoins.\n\nMeanwhile cryptocurrency exchange giant OKX has started offering derivatives trading off of its platform, eliminating the counterparty risk of holding assets on an exchange, at a time in which it\u2019s also introducing its own layer-2 blockchain called X1.\n\nPoloniex, a well-established cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a major security breach after hackers stole over $100 million worth of digital assets from its hot wallets and used some of the funds to pump the price of TRX, a cryptocurrency created by Poloniex investor Justin Sun.\n\nTether to spend $500 million on Bitcoin mining expansion\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has started venturing into the Bitcoin mining industry with a significant investment, aiming to become a global leader in the sector. Tether\u2019s incoming CEO Paolo Ardoino has revealed the firm is investing $500 million over the next six months to strengthen its position in the sector.\n\nArdoino has revealed that Tether is establishing Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. Each of these locations will have a power capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts. The company\u2019s objective is to increase its portion of the Bitcoin hashrate, which is the computational power that underpins the network, to 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, global banking giant JPMorgan has launched a new programmable payment option for its institutional clients using its proprietary blockchain platform JPM Coin.\n\nThe latest feature provides institutional clients with the ability to establish treasury operations that are programmable and operate in real-time, laying the groundwork for cutting-edge digital business models, according to JPMorgan.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have. His work has been published in numerous reputable industry publications. Francisco holds various cryptocurrencies.\n\nFeatured image via Unsplash."

        "content": "The global division of Spanish financial institution Banco Santander \u2013 Santander Private Banking International \u2013 has reportedly introduced a new feature that enables customers with Swiss accounts to engage in the investment and trading of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nGiven Banco Santander\u2019s extensive history of more than 160 years and its broad customer base of 166 million individuals, the private banking division, which attends to 210,000 affluent clients and oversees assets and deposits amounting to around $315 billion, holds significant influence.\n\nHence, the decision to permit high-net-worth clients associated with Santander Private Banking International to engage in BTC and ETH trading is noteworthy and has notable implications for the industry.\n\nSantander\u2019s Historic Move\n\nAlthough Santander\u2019s initial launch of cryptocurrency trading services is said to be limited to BTC and ETH, the banking giant plans to expand its offerings to include other cryptocurrencies once they meet the specified screening criteria, as per information obtained from an internal communication leak reported by Coindesk.\n\nThe report states that Santander initiated the provision of BTC and ETH trading services in response to client requests via relationship managers.\n\nThe bank intends to safeguard the private cryptographic keys of the tradable assets within a regulated custody framework.\n\nJohn Whelan, head of crypto and digital assets at Santander, reportedly said in an email,\n\n\u201cThe Swiss regulation related to digital assets is one of the first and most advanced in the world since it provides clarity and a comprehensive regulatory environment for our clients. As holding of crypto as an alternative asset class continues to expand, we expect that our clients prefer to rely on their existing financial institutions to be responsible for their assets.\u201d\n\nSantander is yet to officially confirm the development.\n\nTryst With Crypto\n\nThe latest development comes almost a year after Santander announced its intention to restrict UK customers from making real-time payments to cryptocurrency exchanges, citing a commitment to shielding its customers from potential scams.\n\nIt had then cited witnessing \u201ca large increase in UK customers becoming victims of cryptocurrency fraud\u201d behind the decision. The financial giant also expressed intention to further \u201cprotect customers\u201d by blocking all faster payments they identify to cryptocurrency exchanges from Santander accounts, a move that was expected to be implemented during 2023\n\nHowever, by June 2023, the bank had shifted its stance and initiated an educational series for its customers focused on digital assets.\n\nWhat makes this change noteworthy is its alignment with a growing interest from institutional entities in crypto assets. Many traditional institutions have joined the trend of embracing Bitcoin ETFs to offer their clients an indirect exposure to cryptocurrency."

Ethereum, on the other hand, is trading around the $2,000 threshold.\u201d\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \u201cThe crypto market started gaining momentum on Sunday, as a pro-Bitcoin candidate \u2014 Javier Milei \u2014 won the elections in Argentina. On this account, BTC (+2.2 percent) observed a steep rise before correcting near $37,200 levels. Analysts predict support to range between $33,000 to $34,500 with resistance at $38,000. On the institution adoption front, Fidelity has become the latest financial firm that is seeking to create an ETH ETF. Joining its rival BlackRock and 5 other companies, the entry of such financial giants in embracing crypto provides positive signals for the sector.\u201d\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, \u201cDogecoin soared dramatically following a groundbreaking partnership with SpaceX, propelling its value to unprecedented heights. Simultaneously, Bitcoin faces market fluctuations, prompting reflection and comparisons to its 2021 performance. Tether strategically invests $500 million in Bitcoin mining, signalling a deliberate expansion and diversification within the stablecoin sector.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, \u201cBitcoin is trading cautiously on the upside at $37,100 and a notable threshold at $38,000. Support levels at $35,835, $35,235 and $34,522 highlight potential stabilization points in the downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed but slightly bullish scenario with RSI at 51 indicating a balanced sentiment. The 50-day EMA at $36,400 supports a short-term bullish trend. Chart analysis reveals a slight ascending channel, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. Overall, while favouring bullish trends above $36,400, the market remains cautious, with immediate resistance and support key for short-term moves and potential moves in the coming days.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \u201cThe overall crypto market cap crossed the 1.4-trillion dollar mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. ETH breached the $2,000 mark per piece due to the euphoria around the Blackrock spot Ethereum ETF application. BTC crossed the $37,000 mark over the weekend and the market is expected to ride the ETF wave in the coming weeks owing to the favourable macroeconomic conditions.\u201d\n\nCoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, \u201cOver the weekend, both BTC and ETH showed strength, each gaining more than 2.5 percent. This unexpected resilience during the usually quiet weekends might be because of the positive news about Javier Milei, a supporter of Bitcoin, winning the presidential election in Argentina. He sees Bitcoin as a way to return money to the private sector. Looking at the technical side, BTC has consistently bounced back from an important incline trendline support and the 20EMA Daily. Currently, it's trading a bit above $37,300, aiming for the next resistance at $38,000. As for ETH, it's sitting around the Support and resistance flip level of $2,011. Breaking through this could push the price to a major resistance level at $2,130, with ETH keeping above the 20-EMA Daily.\u201d\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

        "content": "Sohrab is a passionate cryptocurrency news writer with over five years of experience covering the industry. He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nStory Highlights A rising wedge pattern leads to the current recovery trend in ETH.\n\nThe ETH price may rise 12% before hitting significant resistance at $2250\n\nA bullish breakout from the resistance trendline of the wedge pattern should intensify the buying momentum.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin struggling to surpass the $38,000 mark and delayed approval from the U.S. SEC for some Bitcoin spot ETF has led to a correction in ETH price after hitting a monthly barrier of $2137. Within a fortnight, the coin price has plunged 6% to currently trade at the $2008 mark.\n\nHowever, this correction could be a minor pullback before the Ethereum price takes the next recovery leap, indicating the ETH price prediction has a bullish outlook for the near future\n\nHealthy Retracement Keeps Ethereum Recovery Intact\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe ongoing correction in the Ethereum price can be followed using a downsloping resistance trendline of the 4-hour time frame chart. The coin price reverted several times from the overhead trendline reflecting the market sentiment of selling on a bullish bounce.\n\nUntil this trendline is intact, the ETH price may prolong its ongoing downward trend. However, as per the Fibonacci retracement tool, this pullback is still above the 50% retracement level, which is considered healthy for bullish momentum and carries a long-term recovery.\n\nThus, the market participants bullish on Ethereum should wait for a breakout above the resistance trendline to get better confirmation of trend continuation. The post breakout would surge the prices 12% higher to hit the upper resistant trendline of the long-coming wedge pattern around $2200-$2500.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nMACD indicator: A bearish crossover between the MACD and signal lines projects as a correction trend in action.\n\nEMA: the 20-day EMA slope is offering strong pullback support to the ETH price\n\nIs ETH Price Ready to Hit $2500?\n\nA look at the Daily time frame Chart shows the Ethereum price has been carrying a steady uptrend under the influence of a rising wedge pattern. As the anticipated rate is likely to reach the upper resistance of the pattern, the coin price may witness an intense surge in selling pressure around the $2250 mark.\n\nThe historical data shows a retest to the upper trendline has often resulted in a significant correction within the wedge pattern. Thus, for better confirmation of a bullish trend, the buyers must surpass this overhead trendline.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, the wedge pattern breakout could lead the ETH price rally to $3400."

        "title": "Blast is an Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins - Get Invite for Blast Airdrop - Gizmo Times",
        "content": "So, a new chain has emerged, and this time, it comes with backing from the big names including Paradigm and Standard Crypto. It\u2019s called Blast, and they say, \u201cBlast is the first L2 that incorporates native yield. Your balance on Blast compounds automatically.\u201d\n\nBlast yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The yield from these decentralized protocols is passed back to Blast users automatically. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On Blast, it\u2019s 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins.\n\nHere\u2019s how Blast works.\n\nAuto Rebasing\n\nUsers transact in ETH. Dapps are built around ETH. Blast was designed from the ground up so that ETH itself is natively rebasing on the L2.\n\nL1 Staking\n\nBlast only became possible this year following Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai upgrade. ETH yield from L1 staking, initially Lido, is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2.\n\nT-Bill Yield\n\nUsers who bridge stablecoins receive USDB, Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain T-Bill protocol. USDB can be redeemed for USDC when bridging back to Ethereum.\n\nBlast contributors have raised $20m from Paradigm, Standard Crypto, eGirl Capital, Primitive Ventures, Andrew Kang, Hasu, Foobar, Blurr, Will Price, Hsaka, Santiago Santos, Larry Cermak, Manifold, Jeff Lo, and other crypto-natives.\n\nA quick comparison done on the website of Blast shows that it is better than Optimism and Arbitrum in terms of giving native yields, and it shares all the gas revenues with the developers on the chain, and there are substantial incentives to devs compared to what the devs on the other two chains get.\n\nRight now, users can bridge their funds to Blast, get an early entry into the Airdrop leaderboard, and invite friends to make a team that deposits at least 5 ETH in total, so that they qualify for the squad reward where the entire squad is rewarded with points. The Blast Community Airdrop is split between Early Access Members (50%) and Developers (50%). The ETH that you deposit right now is available for withdrawal in February 2024 when Blast Mainnet gets launched, and the actual distribution of Blast airdrop is going to happen in May 2024.\n\nIf you need invite codes for Blast, you can tweet reply to me @thecaptaingates and I will try to share a few as and when I get them from the squad. Make sure you RT the post that mentions Blast."

        "title": "Blast secures $20 million for Ethereum L2 - NameCoinNews",
        "content": "L2s currently offer a 0% interest rate to their holders. Meaning, it is definite for them to lose the value of their holdings, for they depreciate over time. However, Blast is on a mission to change this by offering 3-4% on ETH through the staking mechanism. Leading ventures like Paradigm and Standard Crypto have invested $20 million to back the process. Others who have invested their financial interests in Blast are Andrew Kang, jez \u2013 known as izabel_eth on X, and Larry Cermak, to mention a few.\n\nBlast has chosen Ethereum as it sports its own version of risk-free interest. It is similar to the one that the US economy has, wherein the Federal Bank leverages the interest rate to keep inflation under check. Investors can only access these through T-Bills. Citizens must beat these interest rates to avoid losing money.\n\nUsers of Blast have a chance of earning 3\u20134% from Ethereum staking. The balance in their wallet compounds annually, in addition to the rolled-out rewards.\n\nSimply put, the balance of a user depreciates with other platforms. The same is not the case with Blast, where users have a chance to accumulate staking and Blast rewards. Blast participates in ETH staking to pass the yield back to the users and dApps of L2. Every single ETH counts to automatically grow in the future. All a user has to do is keep it in their wallet.\n\nNot just ETH, but stablecoins are also eligible for annual accumulation. Yields are different, though, with ETH registering a yield of 4% and stablecoins doing the same at a slightly higher yield of 5%. Built by \u2018Pacman | Blur.io\u2019, the EVM-compatible optimistic rollup supports stablecoins including, but not limited to, USDC, DAI, and USDT. Users receive yield only in the form of USDB. That is the auto-rebasing stablecoin.\n\nBlast has further announced early access to its functionality. Early Access is invite-only, said Blast in the announcement before stating that those who are found eligible to participate will be rewarded with Blast Points. Members will have points that are higher than others. All they have to do is Quote Tweet the thread, explaining why they are excited about Blast. The team will select 20 random Quote Tweets and DM them the invites.\n\nThe development occurred several months prior to the Mainnet launch of Blast. Blast is scheduled to go live on Mainnet in February 2024, per the roadmap. In May 2024, the redemption feature will be activated, allowing members to exchange their Blast Points for items they choose.\n\nA mention of ETH in the announcement has done a small job of boosting its trading value. At the time of articulating this piece, the token\u2019s value slipped by 0.24% to $2,014.00.\n\nThe stage is set for users to express their excitement and stand a chance to win invite-only access to Blast. This will reward them with additional points on top of the standard percentage."
