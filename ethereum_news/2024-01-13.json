        "title": "Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Sees A Case For Spot Ethereum ETF, But Will It Get Approval? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Key Takeaways Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said he \"sees value\" in an Ethereum ETF in a recent interview.\n\nBlackrock, Fidelity, VanEck, and others have already filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, with some of the final deadlines for decisions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scheduled for May.\n\nA spot Ethereum ETF approval may be more problematic than was the case with bitcoin, as there is the potential for Ethereum's underlying crypto asset to be classified as a security.\n\nBlackrock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink may have generated momentum for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, the approval for such a product will likely face a big regulatory hurdle.\n\n\"I see value in having an Ethereum ETF. As I said, these are just stepping stones towards tokenization,\" Fink said in an interview with CNBC Friday morning, just a day after the first spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhy Fink's Comments Matter To An ETH ETF?\n\nBlackrock originally changed how people thought about whether a spot bitcoin ETF would even be possible when the financial titan filed for their own offering in June 2023. They now have their own spot Ethereum ETF proposal as well. Many of the other same financial institutions, such as Ark, and Fidelity, that saw their spot bitcoin ETF products launch on Thursday, have also filed for spot Ether ETFs with the SEC.\n\n\n\nVanEck is first in line for the potential approval of their spot Ethereum ETF product, with a final deadline for a decision from the SEC set for May 23rd.\n\n\n\nETH ETF May Face Regulatory Hurdles\n\nWhile ether is often lumped in with bitcoin (BTCUSD) as the two major blue chip crypto projects, there are concerns that a spot ether ETF approval could be a more complex proposal. Much of the uncertainty around such a financial product has to do with the potential classification of ether (ETHUSD), which is the underlying crypto asset of the Ethereum system, as a security.\n\nWhen asked whether the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could open the door for other crypto asset ETF approvals, such as a spot Ethereum ETF, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated, \"I look at what we did this week as its cabined to one non-security, commodity called bitcoin.\"\n\nThat said, Brown Rudnick Partner Preston Byrne says there may not be many regulatory roadblocks to a spot Ethereum ETF approval. \"So far, the only American regulator to assert that Ethereum is a security in an enforcement action is the NYAG's office,\" Byrne told Investopedia. \"Ethereum's possible status as an unregistered security is a minority view, especially given the fact that the Ethereum Foundation's 2014 sale of Ether is now well past the statute of limitations. I would expect diligent lawyering to address the point in required statutory investor disclosures, but would not expect too much more regulatory interference beyond that.\"\n\nBloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has pegged the odds of a spot Ethereum ETF approval by May at 70%.\n\nNotably, futures-based Ether ETF products are already available for trade in the U.S. market. However, these offerings have not gained much traction and originally launched without much interest from traders."

        "title": "Liquid staking protocols: new era for Ethereum validators - crypto.news",
        "content": "Discover how Ethereum\u2019s shift to PoS and liquid staking protocols transform blockchain technology and address the 32 ETH staking challenge.\n\nEthereum staking has revolutionized the way we use and interact with blockchain technology. With its security now relying on capital rather than computing power, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) offers numerous benefits, including a reported 99% reduction in the network\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, it still presents several drawbacks, chief among them being the 32 ETH economic requirement for participants to run a dedicated node on the network.\n\nYou might also like: What is proof-of-stake (PoS)?\n\nLiquid staking protocols: what to look out for\n\nAs of January, 32 ETH is about $84,724. Not many would-be validators can easily afford that amount, especially in regions with lower incomes.\n\nAdditionally, staking funds become locked and lack liquidity, pushing stakers to join staking pools instead. These pools often prove more profitable than individual validators due to the advantages of smoothing effects, safety mechanisms, and insurance they offer.\n\nThe situation has led to a concentration of power on the Ethereum network, with a small number of stakers controlling a significant share of the blockchain. Since these entities hold most of Ethereum\u2019s validator keys, it gives them full control over crucial aspects like block production, transaction censorship, and MEV (maximal extractable value) choices.\n\nBreakdown of top depositors on Ethereum | Source: Etherscan\n\nAnd as these pools grow larger, they gain more strength, eroding the core decentralization principles of Ethereum. As a result, there have been calls for more decentralized and pocket-friendly solutions to address this concern.\n\nThis is where community-driven liquid staking protocols come in. These platforms offer a new way to stake ETH and enjoy the benefits of staking while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. To shed light on this groundbreaking trend, we sat down with the teams behind three emerging liquid staking protocols: ether.fi, Diva, and Tenderize.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin unveils major overhaul of Ethereum staking\n\nether.fi: unlocking liquid staking\n\nEther.fi team has pioneered a non-custodial protocol that enables users to stake their ETH holdings while keeping their private keys securely in their possession.\n\nether.fi business model | Source: ether.fi\n\nAmong the people associated with this project is Arthur Hayes, an investor who actively contributes to ether.fi through his family office, Maelstrom.\n\nYou might also like: Arthur Hayes dumps Solana for Ether, cites divine inspiration\n\nWhen we asked the ether.fi team about their target audience, they responded,\n\n\u201cWe cater to individuals who have a keen interest in staking Ethereum.\u201d\n\nHowever, they also highlighted the regulatory uncertainties surrounding ETH staking in the United States. Consequently, ether.fi has temporarily geofenced U.S. users until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides more precise guidance.\n\nYou might also like: Staking rewards are now taxable, says IRS\n\nThe ether.fi team prioritized security for their protocol, employing auditors like Nethermind, Omniscia, Zellic, and Solidified to enhance safety measures.\n\nEther.fi offers loyalty points and membership programs, providing rewards for users. The platform adopts a non-custodial approach, allowing users to maintain control over their keys, aligning with the principle of \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nTo tackle liquidity and volatility issues in staked tokens, ether.fi has made provisions for users to withdraw or trade their assets through the eETH liquidity pool.\n\nAs of Jan. 12, ether.fi was one of the major liquid staking protocols per the amount of ETH staked in the last six months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ether_fi/status/1745565800830763314\n\nDiva: another approach to liquid staking\n\nDiva, a liquid staking protocol that will be launched in 2024. Diva\u2019s distributed validator technology (DVT) allows the entire network to perform validation, reducing the risks associated with centralization. Per developers, Diva\u2019s security model, based on DVT, offers improved uptime and a diverse range of operators without requiring permission.\n\nDiva liquid staking model | Source: Diva on Medium\n\nIt provides an alternative to solo staking, which demands 32 ETH per validator and requires considerable technical expertise. Diva\u2019s operator union model makes staking more accessible by allowing users to lock as little as 1 ETH while providing better rewards and flexibility, according to the protocol\u2019s developers.\n\nThe platform engages its community through Discord channels, encouraging users to contribute to early testing and provide feedback. According to the team, the community plays a significant role in governance decisions, ensuring the protocol evolves in response to the needs and concerns of its users.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has played a crucial role in accelerating the growth of liquid staking for ETH. This upgrade completed the circle for Diva, particularly by making liquid staking tokens (LSTs) fully functional. This functionality allows LSTs to trade closely to their fair value, significantly reducing the cost of providing liquidity in defi.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum Shanghai upgrade for geeks: unpacking the tech side\n\nWith deep liquidity pools now more accessible, protocols like Diva may gain a competitive advantage over established players like Lido Finance.\n\nTo ensure the stability and liquidity of the stETH derivative token, Diva employs divETH tokens, which closely track ETH at a 1:1 ratio. This approach, combined with DVT-based security, is how Diva mitigates significant price deviations from ETH.\n\nThe protocol has also adopted a special approach to navigate legal challenges and ensure regulatory compliance globally. Instead of operating as a traditional company or platform, Diva positions itself as a pure software extension of Ethereum. Its immutable code, similar to contracts such as Wrapped ETH or Liquity, ensures that no central entity offers services or charges fees. Diva aims to establish regulatory equivalences by staking on Ethereum itself, simplifying compliance efforts.\n\nAt the time of writing, Diva has not yet launched. However, by offering an Operator Testnet Alpha and proposing a Pre-Launch Vault, Diva aims to encourage early commitments of total value locked (TVL) in ETH or stETH.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/divastaking/status/1737879212625719690\n\nTenderize: empowering validators\n\nTenderize is a liquid staking solution that allows any validator on the network to participate, potentially unlocking as much as $30 billion worth of crypto previously neglected in liquid staking.\n\nAccording to the Tenderize team, the platform has attempted to tackle issues of neglected assets by providing each validator with highly-liquid staked tokens, promoting decentralization in the ecosystem.\n\nTendirize ecosystem | Source: Tenderize website\n\nThe platform has a new upgrade dubbed Tenderize v2, and what sets it apart, in the words of its creators, is its self-custodial nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries. It means users can swiftly exit staking through a native decentralized exchange (DEX), with the shared liquidity approach ensuring greater flexibility and liquidity access without centralizing stake on whitelisted nodes.\n\nMuch like Diva, the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade played a vital role in accelerating the growth of liquid staking for Tenderize, with the platform reportedly experiencing its fair share of positive impact.\n\nPrior to the upgrade, TenderSwap, a crucial component of the Tenderize protocol, faced limitations in facilitating unstaking. However, with the upgrade, users could unstake ETH, which paved the way for the launch of tETH through Tenderize v2.\n\nThe protocol emphasizes community involvement in its development, with Tenderize offering grants to validators and liquidity providers for their input and testing. The platform also involves token holders in governance decisions, such as fee and reward determination.\n\nIn liquid staking, addressing stability and liquidity concerns is crucial. Tenderize offers two methods for converting tTokens back to their original form.\n\nOne method is through TenderSwap v2, where users can exchange their tTokens (like tMATIC, tLPT, or tGRT) for the corresponding asset (MATIC, LPT, or GRT) at a 1:1 ratio, subject to a service fee. The alternative method requires waiting for the unstaking period to end, which varies by blockchain. Tenderize aims to maintain a 1:1 swap ratio on TenderSwap to manage price deviation risks and support user stability and liquidity.\n\nThe mainnet launch is scheduled at Jan. 29, according to Tenderize X account.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tenderize_me/status/1745799023569879411\n\nLiquid staking protocols: the future of staking?\n\nEthereum staking represents a notable development in the cryptocurrency space, with various projects contributing to this trend. These projects enable users to stake amounts less than 32 ETH, supporting Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake.\n\nAdditionally, these projects offer methods for users to liquidate their staked assets without undergoing a full withdrawal process, enhancing the flexibility of cryptocurrency staking.\n\nProjects supporting ETH staking below the 32 ETH threshold provide an opportunity for users to participate in staking with smaller investments."

These funds would allow investors to trade shares representing Ethereum on traditional stock exchanges, acting as a bridge between conventional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Several Bitcoin funds, including BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF, were launched yesterday, marking the first spot Bitcoin ETFs trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nSome market watchers speculate that Ethereum ETFs could be the next financial products to list in U.S. markets, as BlackRock filed its official application last November.\n\nWith its successful Bitcoin ETF application, BlackRock has a near-perfect record with the SEC in ETF applications, failing only once."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently following a pattern similar to previous years, during which their prices surged by 500% and 1,000%, respectively, according to the latest research report by Coinbase Research and Glassnode.\n\nThe observation draws parallels between the ongoing crypto market cycle and the period from 2018 to 2022, characterized by substantial price increases in both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Halving\u2019s Potential Impact on Crypto Markets\n\nAnalysts highlight various cyclicality metrics, such as net unrealized profit/loss and supply in profit, which mirror past trends. These metrics indicate that the present state of the crypto markets doesn\u2019t mirror the euphoric conditions seen during the peak of 2023. It suggests there might still be potential for the market to experience further surges.\n\nDespite acknowledging the potential positive impact of the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, Coinbase Research is cautious.\n\nThe paper noted a lack of robust supporting evidence and characterized the relationship between the halving and market performance as somewhat speculative.\n\nThe research points out that, with only three halving events historically, there isn\u2019t a fully established pattern, especially considering previous events were influenced by factors like global liquidity measures.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, projected to occur in April 2024 based on current mining rates, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAnalyzing Ethereum\u2019s Market and Upcoming Upgrade\n\nIn 2023, the Ethereum (ETH) price surged by over 90%, driven by several factors, such as the success of the Shapella upgrade and the increasing likelihood of approval for spot crypto ETFs. Market participants were encouraged by these developments, contributing to the increase in the ETH value.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are focusing on the upcoming Ethereum upgrade named Cancun. It is expected to enhance scalability and security to make layer-2 transactions as cost-effective as possible.\n\nThe successful implementation of Cancun could potentially lead to a significant increase in the number of processed transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s analysis notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum have undergone two cycles, encompassing both bull and bear markets. The ongoing cycle, initiated in 2022, closely mirrors the patterns observed in the preceding ones."

        "content": "Ethereum Price Prediction: The second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum(ETH) has been notably bullish this week likely attributed to the recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S market. Surprisingly, the ETH price surpassed the Bitcoin performance amid the ETF approval recording a 17.7% weekly growth. Amid this upswing, the coin buyers breached above the $2430 swing high, indicating the potential for a higher recovery.\n\nIs Ethereum Price Heading to $3000?\n\nThe ETH price will continue to walk an aggressive rally until the ascending support trendline is intact.\n\nThe rising prices may face supply pressure at $2700, followed by $3000\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $16.8 Billion, indicating a 14% loss.\n\nOver the past three months, the Ethereum price has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory, evidenced by an ascending trendline. Starting from a low of $1522, the price of the coin has experienced a remarkable surge of 77%, reaching a new high of $2717.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe periodic pullbacks within this rally suggest active buyer accumulation at lower price points, a crucial characteristic of a prolonged rally. Throughout December, the ETH price movement was predominantly lateral, as the market anticipated the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAs the US SEC approved BTC ETF trading on Wednesday, the ETH price jumped 10.21% to breach the overhead resistance of $2140 indicating the asset is poised for higher growth.\n\nMoreover, Larry Fink, the Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, expressed support for the idea of introducing an Ethereum-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This statement came shortly after the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETF. In a recent discussion on CNBC, Fink said, \u201cI see value in having an Ethereum ETF,\u201d. Later he also added, \u201cThese are just stepping stones towards tokenization and I really do believe this is where we\u2019re going to be going\u201d.\n\nFollowing the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, the prospects for a Spot Ethereum ETF have significantly increased, potentially setting the stage for substantial growth in Ethereum\u2019s value.\n\nKey Support To Watch in Market Correction\n\nBy the press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,565, experiencing a slight retracement to retest the previously surpassed resistance level of $2,400. Should the price sustainably remain above this newly established support, there\u2019s potential for the ongoing recovery to extend towards targets of $2,700, followed by $3,000, and $3,281.\n\nConversely, in the event of a fresh correction in the ETH price, investors should pay close attention to the ascending trendline. This could present an opportunity for a strategic pullback, offering a potential entry point for those looking to capitalize on such market movements\n\nBollinger Band: An uptick in the upper boundary of the Bollinger Band indicator shows the buyers dominating the asset.\n\nAverage Directional Index: The daily ADX value of 19% indicates the last correction has managed to recover the exhausted bullish momentum.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSahil Mahadik Sahil is a dedicated full-time trader with over three years of experience in the financial markets.

        "content": "Unlike XRP, Solana has a number of high-upside growth catalysts in place for 2024.\n\nAt the end of December, Solana (SOL -0.17%) flipped XRP (XRP 4.27%) to become the fifth-most valuable cryptocurrency. This capped off an impressive run for Solana in 2023. At one point, Solana was up more than 1,000% for the year.\n\nAll this has me thinking it's finally time to forget about XRP. The former crypto market darling is still bogged down in litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Until that regulatory matter is cleared up, XRP shows no signs of breaking through the $1 price level. Contrast that to Solana, which now seems to have a very bright future ahead of it. Let's take a closer look.\n\nSolana is on pace to topple Ethereum\n\nThe primary investment thesis for Solana is that it is the new Ethereum (ETH 0.24%). Since 2020, crypto investors have been touting Solana as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and that scenario now seems to be finally playing out. While there are plenty of other Layer 1 blockchain challengers out there, Solana seems to be the one with the best chance of displacing Ethereum.\n\nSimply stated, Solana is a faster, cheaper, more efficient version of Ethereum. While Ethereum had to pull off a very complicated technical transformation (known as The Merge) to become an energy-efficient, proof-of-stake blockchain back in 2022, Solana launched right out of the box as a proof-of-stake blockchain. Whether it's transaction processing speed or overall transaction throughput, Solana seems to have the superior technology.\n\nGranted, the \"best technology\" does not always win. There are a lot of other factors to consider, including first-mover advantage and network effects. That's why Solana has taken nearly four years to finally catch up to Ethereum. But the investment narrative around Solana certainly seems to be shifting. A number of very smart investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- now seem to buy into the idea of Solana as a faster, more cost-efficient version of Ethereum.\n\nSolana has some big-time growth catalysts in place\n\nWhile Ethereum has been around longer than Solana, Solana has one thing Ethereum does not: a mobile crypto strategy. First announced back in the summer of 2022, this mobile crypto strategy has steadily been taking shape over the past 18 months.\n\nLast May, Solana finally launched the first-ever mobile crypto phone, the Saga. The goal of the crypto phone was to usher in a new mobile-first approach to crypto. Think about it -- today's smartphones are not crypto-native. They are designed for neither crypto users nor crypto wallets or for buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while waiting in line for a coffee from your favorite barista. So, Solana -- led by a talented team of former Qualcomm (QCOM -1.47%) engineers -- decided to change all that.\n\nThis mobile crypto strategy also includes a mobile payments component. In February 2022, Solana launched Solana Pay, a blockchain-based payment protocol for merchants who want to accept crypto at the point of sale. Again, this builds on a very intuitive idea: Some people want to pay with crypto, and most merchants want to avoid high credit card processing fees. As a proof-of-concept, Solana announced an integration with Shopify (SHOP -1.91%) at the end of August.\n\nYes, of course, these mobile crypto initiatives could absolutely fail. But they are the types of big-time growth catalysts that XRP simply does not have right now. As long as the legal drama with the SEC stretches on (which could be until the end of 2024), it's highly unlikely that XRP will be able to do much of anything in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, the company behind the XRP token (Ripple Labs) is hemorrhaging cash to pay lawyers. According to Ripple executives, these legal costs could wind up being more than $200 million.\n\nBefore you dump all your XRP tokens\n\nWhile I'm highly confident that Solana could be an unstoppable crypto in 2024, there's also a chance that XRP could soar in price this year. Last summer, when XRP scored a major legal win in its ongoing SEC court case, the price of XRP doubled nearly overnight. So, there is upside potential. If you're currently holding XRP tokens, it could be worth waiting to see what develops.\n\nOver a long-term horizon, though, Solana appears to be a far superior investment. As soon as Solana flipped XRP at year-end, that should have been a wake-up call to XRP investors. It's finally time to look for a new crypto champion, and right now, that champion appears to be Solana."

        "title": "Will Solana (SOL) take over the Market Cap of Ethereum (ETH) in 2024 and become the second biggest after - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, few projects have achieved the level of recognition and impact that Ethereum (ETH) has. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has played a pivotal role in shaping the blockchain landscape. However, there\u2019s a rising contender on the horizon\u2014Solana (SOL). In this article, we\u2019ll explore the potential for Solana to surpass Ethereum\u2019s market cap in 2024 and become the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nEthereum, often referred to as the \u201cworld computer\u201d of blockchain, is an open-source blockchain platform introduced by Vitalik Buterin and his co-founders in 2015. Ethereum\u2019s native digital currency, Ether (ETH), fuels the network and serves as the foundation for a wide range of decentralised applications (DApps). At its core, Ethereum enables the execution of smart contracts, self-executing agreements with coded terms that run without the need for intermediaries. Ethereum\u2019s journey began with a white paper outlining its ambitious vision for a decentralised, censorship-resistant global computer. The project raised funds through a public crowd sale in 2014, leading to its official launch in 2015. Since then, Ethereum has undergone several updates, with the most recent being the London Hard Fork.\n\nKey Features of Ethereum:\n\nSmart Contracts: Ethereum\u2019s introduction of smart contracts revolutionised the blockchain industry. These self-executing contracts enable a wide array of decentralised applications and use cases. Decentralised Applications (DApps): Ethereum\u2019s blockchain serves as the foundation for a multitude of DApps, ranging from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. ERC-20 Tokens: Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 standard allows developers to create tokens on the platform, giving rise to a vast ecosystem of tokens and projects. Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Ethereum facilitates the creation of DAOs, organisations governed by code rather than individuals, fostering trustless decision-making.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nSolana: A Rising Star\n\nSolana, on the other hand, is a relative newcomer to the crypto scene, but it has rapidly gained attention for its innovative approach to blockchain technology. Launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, Solana aims to provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nKey Features of Solana:\n\nProof of History (PoH): Solana employs a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History, granting each node its independent clock and decision-making capability. This enhances the overall efficiency of the network. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): Solana utilises BFT algorithms to ensure the stability and functionality of the system, even in the face of node failures. Speed and Cost-Efficiency: Solana\u2019s blockchain offers lightning-fast transaction speeds, with an average cost of just $0.00025. This scalability addresses common issues of high fees and slow confirmation times in the crypto space.\n\nSolana (SOL) vs. Ethereum (ETH): Investment Perspective\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are faced with the choice of whether to invest in established giants like Ethereum or explore newer projects like Solana. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the investment perspective for both. Ethereum has solidified its position as a cornerstone of the blockchain industry. With a rich ecosystem of DApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces, Ethereum offers a diverse range of use cases. Recent updates, such as the London Hard Fork, have increased efficiency and scalability. Ethereum\u2019s native token, Ether (ETH), remains an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth and passive income through staking. On the other hand, Solana has garnered attention for its speed and cost-efficiency, making it an appealing choice for traders and DeFi enthusiasts. Its ability to process a high volume of transactions within seconds has positioned it as a strong contender in the DeFi space. Institutional and retail interest in Solana has surged, reflecting confidence in its potential for further growth. Analysts suggest that including a percentage of established tokens like Ethereum in a portfolio can offer passive income potential over the long term. However, the rapidly evolving crypto landscape also presents opportunities in newer projects like Solana. Investors should conduct thorough research to make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\n>>>> Click Here To Buy RETIK Tokens <<<<\n\nRetik Finance: The Emerging DeFi King\n\nWhile Ethereum and Solana vie for market dominance, there\u2019s another player in the DeFi arena worth considering\u2014Retik Finance (RETIK). This innovative project, currently in its presale stage, aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Retik Finance offers a comprehensive ecosystem that includes the Retik Wallet, DeFi Debit Cards, and Retik Pay, enabling seamless cryptocurrency transactions and spending.

This strong performance reflects growing investor confidence in the project\u2019s potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe battle for supremacy in the crypto world continues, with Ethereum and Solana competing for market dominance. While Ethereum boasts a rich history and a diverse ecosystem of DApps and tokens, Solana\u2019s speed and cost-efficiency have positioned it as a formidable contender. Amidst this competition, Retik Finance (RETIK) emerges as an exciting newcomer in the DeFi space.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL had a remarkable 2023, surging over 1,000% and exceeding $100.\n\nAnalysts on Twitter, like Ali and JAKE, foresee potential SOL gains within the following months.\n\nTrader Alex Kr\u00fcger suggests the possibility of a Solana ETF in the US next year, which could attract more capital into the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs SOL Ready for a Further Rally?\n\nSOL performed exceptionally last year, skyrocketing by over 1,000% and surpassing the $100 mark. Numerous experts believe the upswing will continue in the following months.\n\nOne of those is the X (Twitter) user Ali, who suggested Solana \u201cis showing signs of forming a bull flag.\u201d The analyst thinks that a \u201cdecisive close\u201d above the $110 resistance level could be a catalyst for a rally toward $163.\n\nThe popular content creator and investor using the X handle JAKE praised Solana\u2019s \u201crobust\u201d ecosystem, claiming it is better than Ethereum in terms of speed and costs. He claimed that these advantages, alongside the essential partnerships that Solana has inked in the past several months, would push SOL toward an unseen peak within one year:\n\n\u201cI do expect to see over a $750 price per Solana token in 2025. Obviously, there are a lot of factors contributing to this, but as more and more people move away from the Ethereum blockchain and onto other blockchains like Solana, I do expect to see Solana to be the top competitor of Ethereum in the next bull run.\u201d\n\nAs CryptoPotato recently reported, Solana briefly surpassed its rival on multiple fronts, including Google searches. However, Ethereum restored its lead at the start of 2024.\n\nAlex Kr\u00fcger \u2013 trader and analyst \u2013 did not lay out a precise SOL price forecast but envisioned that a Solana ETF would pop up in the US next year. He suggested that this would happen as a result of the Republicans (specifically Donald Trump) winning America\u2019s presidential elections in 2024, followed by the possible resignation of Gary Gensler as a Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA Solana ETF will remove some of the barriers associated with investing in crypto, such as self-custody, enabling more people (hence capital) to flow into the ecosystem.\n\nRecall that the US SEC recently approved a wave of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from finance giants, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and more.\n\nWhile still on the SOL topic, you can check out our latest video dedicated to the best Solana wallets you can use this year:"

        "content": "The Ethereum price might be doing well post-spot Bitcoin ETF launch, but recent moves by Celsius threaten to destabilize the price movement. The now-bankrupt crypto lender seems to have begun its reimbursement plan to its creditors, as on-chain data reveal the movement of its ETH holdings to crypto exchanges.\n\nAccording to crypto market intelligence company Arkham Intelligence, Celsius Network carried out transfers worth over $125 million worth of ETH last week to various crypto exchanges.\n\nCelsius Transfers ETH To Exchanges\n\nData shows that between January 8 and January 12, Celsius executed transfers worth $95.5 million to crypto exchange Coinbase while also sending $29.73 million to FalconX. At the time of writing, Celsius Network\u2019s balance sheet has 584,601 ETH worth $1.47 billion. Notably, it also has 9,799 BTC worth $418.2 million and 659 million CEL tokens worth $133.2 million on its books, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Hashrate Hits New All-Time High Amid Spot ETF Frenzy 8 months ago\n\nLooks like Celsius took the opportunity to unload >$125M of ETH over ETF Week. In the past week, they\u2019ve deposited $95.5M to Coinbase and sent $29.73M to FalconX. They still have $1.4 billion (540K ETH) remaining.https://t.co/jp1PJbN46r pic.twitter.com/xgfX6yU5Ye \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) January 13, 2024\n\nCelsius\u2019s motive behind the transfers into exchange points to nothing apart from an intending selloff, as the company is well on its way to clearing its liabilities under bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nCelsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 shortly after the fall of TerraUSD and the LUNA ecosystem, leading to creditors having their funds trapped on the platform for the last 18 months. However, the defunct crypto lender has been making major moves in its bankruptcy proceedings to refund creditors. According to reports, the company sold $240 million worth of ETH in December 2023.\n\nNotably, the company communicated its decision earlier this month on January 5 to unstake $465 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) which will be distributed to its creditors.\n\nETH price shows strength as new trading week opens up | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIncoming Ethereum Price Crash?\n\nEthereum is currently on a roll, still on a 13% gain in the past seven days. However, huge selloffs like this tend to shake market confidence, leading to a sell-off from other investors. On the other hand, some tend to believe that the crypto is sufficiently resilient.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nHow To Buy, Sell, And Trade Tokens On The BSC Network 8 months ago\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Ethereum retained its bullish sentiment during the time these transfers were made, as price action revealed a 23% jump from $2,191 on January 8 to $2,706 on January 12. Ethereum has declined since then and is now trading at $2,514. According to Coinglass, $23.84 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours.\n\nDespite the recent large transfers, Celsius still retains significant cryptocurrency assets including ETH, BTC, MATIC, and LINK. A decision to continue the selling off of these assets could lead to a bigger dent in the price of the assets, particularly Ethereum, which is now testing the $2,500 support level.\n\nOn-chain data from Spotonchain also reported FTX and Alameda Research moving 1,000 ETH worth $2.33 million to crypto exchange Coinbase during the week.\n\nFeatured image from The Daily Hodl, chart from Tradingview.com"

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT what will be ETH price if Ethereum ETF is approved - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "United States regulators finally approved the highly awaited spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with analysts expressing that this move opens up more opportunities for the cryptocurrency sector. Indeed, there is a bullish sentiment regarding the product\u2019s long-term impact, mainly due to its potential to attract institutional investors.\n\nIn this context, there are speculations that such a product will likely spill over to other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH), the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Analysts are also speculating that there is a possibility of a spot Ethereum ETF getting approved in 2024.\n\nWith the product likely to impact the value of ETH, Finbold consulted the generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT by OpenAI to provide a possible price trajectory for Ethereum. If the product is approved, the tool offered bullish and bearish scenarios for Ethereum.\n\nBullish scenario\n\nAccording to the tool, if a spot Ethereum ETF secures regulatory approval, it could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. Increased institutional interest and mainstream adoption may attract investors seeking exposure to Ethereum without direct ownership.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s approval could generate a surge in demand, fostering positive sentiment and confidence in Ethereum.\n\nIn this optimistic scenario, ChatGPT pointed out that Ethereum\u2019s price might experience a significant surge but acknowledged the challenges of identifying the exact valuation of the asset. Nevertheless, the AI tool noted that the cryptocurrency could potentially reach levels above $3,000.\n\nThe tool, however, cautioned that the bullish outlook depends on market dynamics, institutional interest, and broader cryptocurrency trends.\n\nEthereum ChatGPT bullish price prediction. Source: ChatGPT.\n\nBearish scenario\n\nContrary to expectations, approving a spot Ethereum ETF might not guarantee sustained positive market sentiment. The tool suggested that traders and investors could opt to \u201csell the news,\u201d leading to a short-term price correction.\n\nAdditionally, regulatory uncertainties or concerns about the ETF\u2019s structure might create skepticism among market participants.\n\nChatGPT noted that Ethereum could face a temporary decline in a bearish scenario. The price might drop below its current trading levels, ranging from $2,300 to $2,000 or even lower, depending on the extent of market reactions.\n\nEthereum spot ETF Potential\n\nIndeed, prominent figures in the financial world suggest that an Ethereum ETF could be monumental. Specifically, BlackRock\u2019s (NYSE: BLK) CEO Larry Fink noted that he \u2018sees value\u2019 in a spot Ethereum ETF following the successful launch of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIt is worth noting that BlackRock, the largest investment management firm in the world, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot in Ethereum ETF in November of last year.\n\nMoreover, decisions on spot Ethereum ETF applications are anticipated from the SEC starting in May. Apart from BlackRock, other notable firms in line for approval include Invesco, Ark, and VanEck, alongside Grayscale, which aims to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum faces heightened buying pressure, contrasting with Bitcoin\u2019s weakening trend following the ETF approval.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,548, reflecting weekly gains exceeding 13%.\n\nETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn terms of technical analysis, the asset is characterized by bullish sentiments. A summary of the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicates a \u2018buy\u2019 rating at 15, with moving averages signaling a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13. Additionally, oscillators are holding a \u2018neutral\u2019 position at 8.\n\nETH technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn conclusion, the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF has potentially increased the likelihood of witnessing a similar product for Ethereum. However, the impact on the price of Ethereum will likely be influenced by the overall market sentiment at the same time.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
